   An 18-year-old woman has undergone an
abortion in violation of a court order to prevent her from
terminating her pregnancy, the woman's attorneys said Wednesday.
   The attorneys sent a notice of the abortion to the Indiana
Supreme Court one day after asking the high court Tuesday for an
immediate review of a Vigo Circuit Court injunction to prohibit an
abortion.
   Attorneys for both the woman and her 24-year-old boyfriend, who
sought the injunction, said they still want the Supreme Court to
make a decision on the issues raised by the case. The couple are
from Terre Haute. Their names are withheld in court records because
the case involves a paternity action.
   ``Faced with the decision of continuing with an unwanted
pregnancy and with violating a court order, she made the decision
she felt was right,'' said the notice signed by Richard A. Waples,
an Indiana Civil Liberties Union attorney who represented the
unmarried woman.
   ``She arrived at the decision to terminate her pregnancy after
consultation with her family and her physician,'' the statement
said. ``She did what she had to do to protect both her physical and
emotional health.''
   James Bopp Jr., who represents the man who claims to be the
father of the fetus, said his client ``is absolutely devastated
that his child has been taken from him.''
   Bopp said he and his client haven't thought about whether they
would want Vigo Circuit Court Judge Robert H. Brown to issue a
contempt citation against the woman for violating Brown's
injunction. Brown issued a permanent injunction on Monday.
   ``He loves this girl,'' Bopp said of his client. ``He's not
interested in punishing her.''
   However, in a brief filed with the Supreme Court, Bopp argued
that a violation of the injunction should be punishable by a
contempt of court citation.
   Waples told the court he wants it to review the case because of
the issues involved, the precedent set by Brown's injunction and
potential sanctions against the woman.
   If allowed to stand, Brown's ruling invites ``other Indiana
courts to engage in the same pernicious and impermissible inquiry
into, and overruling of, a competent adult woman's decision to
terminate her first trimester pregnancy,'' Waples told the court.
   The woman's attorneys said her first trimester would have ended
sometime during the next two weeks. The attorneys would not divulge
details of when or where the abortion was performed.
   Waples argued Brown's decision violates the 1973 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling in Roe vs. Wade, which upheld a woman's right to an
abortion during the first three months of a pregnancy.
   Bopp, who is also a general counsel for the national Right to
Life organization, said he wants a court decision detailing what
rights a father has in such cases.
   ``Fathers have rights in particular cases. All we said in this
case is we want those rights to be balanced'' against the rights of
the mother, Bopp said.
   Bobb told the Supreme Court ``the mother's reasons for wanting
an abortion are the result of an immature reasoning process, are
insubstantial and border on the frivolous, and do not outweigh the
strong interests of the father in seeing the child born and in his
custody.''
   Bopp's brief described the woman as an unemployed high school
dropout who began a relationship with the man, a delivery truck
driver, following a date on New Year's Eve.
   According to the brief, Brown's ruling noted testimony that the
woman wanted an abortion to preserve her figure so she would look
good in a bathing suit and to keep from being pregnant during the
summer.

<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department, worried about
the financial health of Texas Air Corp., launched an investigation
Wednesday into the finances and management of the nation's largest
airline company.
   In a separate action, the Federal Aviation Administration levied
a proposed $823,000 in fines against a Texas Air subsidiary,
Eastern Airlines, for violating safety regulations and said it has
begun a new round of safety inspections of the Miami-based air
carrier.
   In announcing the two-pronged action against the Houston-based
airline company, Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the
department's concerns were raised by evidence that Eastern and
Continental Airlines, also owned by Texas Air, ``are under
substantial, increasing financial pressure.''
   The department wants to determine if Texas Air and its
management are ``fit, willing and able'' to carry commercial air
traffic, Burnley said at a news conference also attended by FAA
Administrator Allan McArtor.
   In a statement, Texas Air called the federal probe ``union
inspired'' and suggested the Transportation Department only had
reacted to union leaders ``who ... have mounted a continuing
campaign of distortion and lies'' about safety at both Eastern and
Continental.
   ``Texas Air remains financially strong with over $850 million in
cash at the end of the first quarter,'' the statement said.
   But on Wall Street, word of the federal investigation caused
Texas Air stock to drop more than $1 a share, to $10.75, on the
American Stock Exchange. The stock closed at $10.87{, down 87{
cents from Tuesday.
   Texas Air Corp. had record losses of $466 million last year and
its Eastern subsidiary has been plagued with labor turmoil. In
addition to Eastern and Continental, the company also owns a number
of commuter carriers.
   In recent months there has been increasing sentiment in Congress
for a closer examination of Texas Air, whose airlines have nearly
one-fifth of the commercial airline market in the country. A
resolution which would have urged such a probe has gained the
support of more than 150 congressmen.
   The $823,000 civil penalty against Eastern comes 14 months after
Eastern agreed to pay $9.5 million in penalties because of earlier
safety infractions. FAA officials said the latest fine stems from
record keeping and maintenance infractions similar to those found
in the earlier action.
   The fine is based on findings from an investigation last
September and October, but Eastern now has an opportunity to
challenge it. If the airline can produce evidence the FAA considers
valid, the fine could be reduced.
   McArtor said the new FAA review was being conducted because of
concern about the ``continuing pattern of fines, safety violations
and apparent insensitivity of some of Eastern's officials'' to FAA
safety regulations.
   He also said the agency would examine its own routine inspection
of Eastern because of ``what appears to be recurring trends of
non-compliance'' to FAA regulations at the airline, which is the
country's sixth largest.
   In Miami, Phil Bakes, Eastern's president, called the latest FAA
action ``unfair and disparate'' and alleged that it was prompted by
pressure from unions representing disgruntled Eastern employees.
   The FAA inspection would include an examination of each of
Eastern's 267 aircraft over the next 30 days at airport ramps where
Eastern flies, officials said.
   Burnley and McArtor, nevertheless, said they are confident that
both Eastern and Continental Airlines are safe to fly. Burnley said
he would not hesitate to use either air carrier, adding that if
circumstances were otherwise the FAA would take actions to ground
the airline.
   Eastern's problems with the FAA in part prompted the broader
investigation into Texas Air's financial and management practices.
   But department officials said that recent filings by Texas Air
with the Securities and Exchange Commission also suggested the need
for the department to take a closer look at the financial fitness
of both Continental and Eastern as well as its parent company.
   ``The recent activities of the Texas Air Corp. and its carriers
_ particularly Continental and Eastern _ raise questions concerning
whether the carriers can and are disposed to comply with the safety
and economic rules applicable to air carriers,'' the department
said in its order for an investigation.
   It said that a number of financial transactions between Texas
Air and the two subsidiary airlines ``raise questions concerning
whether substantial funds and other resources are being diverted
from the air carrier subsidiaries.''
   The department questioned, for example:
   _ Texas Air shifting Eastern's profitable computer reservation
system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note ``which
may be less than the system's fair market value.''
   _ Eastern paying ``substantial fees'' for management services,
fuel purchases and other activities provided by the parent company.
   _ Eastern accepting a no-interest note, instead of cash, for $16
million in reimbursements owed to the airline as part of its
acquisition by Texas Air.
   _ Texas Air borrowing $25 million from Eastern in March 1987 in
exchange for an unsecured note at a time when Eastern was having
cash flow problems.
   B. Wayne Vance, the departmemt's general counsel, said 15 to 20
government economists and auditors will focus on Texas Air Corp.'s
financial records, management practices and the financial
relationships between the airline subsidiaries and their parent
company.
   In addition to Eastern and Continental, Texas Air Corp., also
owns Rocky Mountain Airways, Britt Airways, Bar Harbor Airlines and
Provincetown-Boston Airlines.

<TEXT>
   A Sandinista negotiator on Wednesday
accused the Contras of maneuvering to avoid a permanent cease-fire
and keep receiving U.S. aid.
   ``We have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive
cease-fire,'' Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco told a
news conference.
   ``They simply want to move into zones which means gains for them
without a threat, with security and to gain the release of 50
percent of the prisoners, American aid and participation in
politics.''
   There was no immediate response from the rebels. The government
and Contras have been arguing by letter about cease-fire talks,
jeopardizing a meeting set for Friday that would be their first in
Managua since the war began in 1981.
   The Contras suggested in a letter Wednesday that a meeting on
implementation of the cease-fire be held Thursday at Sapoa, a
southern border post where a provisional truce was signed March 23,
and they threatened to boycott the Friday meeting in the capital.
Earlier this week, they wanted the technical meeting held Wednesday.
   In a letter sent Tuesday night to Contra leaders in Miami,
officials of the leftist Sandinista government said talks on
technical aspects of the truce should be held in Managua on
Wednesday and that Friday's high-level meeting should go ahead as
planned.
   Nicaraguan officials and the U.S.-supported rebels also disagree
on where Contra delegates should stay while in Managua and what
they should be allowed to do.
   The technical talks in Sapoa broke down last Friday after six
rounds in which the two sides agreed only on seven zones to which
Contra fighters would be confined during the 60-day truce.
   Still to be worked out are security for the rebels in those
zones, methods of resupplying them and other details of their
existence during the two months allowed for negotiating a permanent
cease-fire.
   Rebel fighters had been scheduled to be in the zones by this
Friday, but they have not even begun gathering. Officials say they
will free a second group of political prisoners when the Contras
are in the zones.
   Nicaragua is estimated to have more than 3,000 political
prisoners. The Sandinistas released 100 soon after the provisional
truce was signed.
   The truce began April 1. Since then, the sides have exchanged
heated arguments but reached no agreement on ways to end the war.
   On Wednesday, the Contras said in a letter to Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega that the Friday meeting was ``subject to the
results'' of the technical meetings at Sapoa. They contend there is
nothing for leaders to discuss until the ``mechanical operation''
of the zones is resolved.
   Rebel leaders Adolfo Calero and Pedro Joaquin Chamorro signed
the letter, which said the Contra delegation had reservations at
the Intercontinental Hotel in downtown Managua. The Sandinistas
want the Contras at a government-owned hotel near the airport
``because it has all the necessary requirements.''
   Calero and Chamorro said Contra delegates also demand the
freeedom to meet with civic and political organizations during
their three days in Managua.
   Sandinista officials say the truce agreement makes clear that
Contras can enter political life only after their combatants are in
the cease-fire zones.

   A downtown theater operator said Wednesday he
is yanking the controversial film ``Colors,'' which is about street
gangs, because his staff is afraid it will draw violence.
   ``The staff at the theater were in a panic because the home turf
of one of the gangs in the movie is just a couple of miles from
downtown,'' said Bob Laemmle, co-owner of the popular Laemmle
theater chain.
   The movie, which stars Sean Penn and Robert Duvall as Los
Angeles policemen battling street gangs, is set to open Friday. It
was scheduled to be shown at the Laemmle Grand, which is downtown
next to a luxury hotel.
   ``The fact that a movie theater ... two days before, decides not
to play a motion picture _ that happens all the time,'' said Joel
Resnick, in charge of distribution for Orion Pictures. He said
about 70 theaters in the greater Los Angeles area will show the
film.
   Before a screening of the film Wednesday, director Dennis Hopper
said: ``There is nothing in this film that glorifies being in a
gang.'' He added that the film story is told from police officers'
point of view.
   ``I don't know how people can twist it around and say I'm
glorifying gangs.''
   However, the Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People joined the chorus
objecting to the film opening in Los Angeles during a period of
heightened tension over gang violence.
   Nearly 100 people have been killed this year in gang-related
violence in Los Angeles County. Last year, there were 387
gang-related killings.
   ``The balance between civil order and disorder in this city
today is tenuous at best, and we feel that a release of this film
.... may result in more lost of young lives,'' said NAACP chapter
president Willis Edwards.

   Eli Bradley Jr. admits he sampled one or
two grapes at a grocery store. The prosecutor says Bradley ate 2
pounds of grapes, and felony charges are being pressed.
   Bradley said it was ridiculous to be charged with larceny from a
building, a felony punishable by up to four years in prison,
instead of the lesser charge of shoplifting, which carries a 90-day
jail term.
   ``If I'd known, I would've made them take me straight to the
hospital and had my stomach pumped,'' said Bradley, 52, of Summit
Township. ``My only proof was in my stomach.''
   Bradley was arraigned last week in District Court on the felony
charge. He was released on $10,000 personal bond pending
preliminary examination April 19.
   Bradley had bought $14 worth of fruit, including two bags of
grapes, and was leaving the store March 4 when a security guard
stopped him.
   ``They told me to come on back inside and called the police,''
Bradley said. ``I told them, `You've got to be kidding me.' I
didn't eat more than one or two. I even offered them a dollar.''
   Bradley said the guard might have mistakenly thought he was
concealing a mouthful of grapes. He said his front teeth had been
knocked out by a cue stick, leaving the exposed nerves sensitive to
air.
   ``I cover my mouth so the air doesn't hurt, maybe they thought I
was eating grapes,'' he said.
   Bradley said he thought the case was closed after police
questioned him at the scene. But Jackson County Prosecutor Joseph
Filip later issued a felony warrant for Bradley's arrest.
   Filip said although 2 pounds of grapes are worth only about $2,
he filed the felony charge because several repeat shoplifters he's
prosecuted have received probation.

   Collegians who raise their steins to the
strains of the ``Maine Stein Song'' should raise their voices in
song, instead, as they sing a dry version of the song made famous
by Rudy Vallee in the 1930s.
   ``I respect your right to go drink your brains out. But the
university shouldn't encourage it,'' said University of Maine
computer science Professor George Narkowsky, who wants to delete
all references to drinking and sexism from the lyrics.
   For decades, students at university events have sung: ``Fill
your steins to dear old Maine, shout till the rafters ring, stand
and drink a toast once again, let every loyal Maine man sing.''
   Instead of filling steins, Narkowsky suggests, ``Raise a song to
dear old Maine.'' He would like to forget the toast and instead
``stand and sing an ode once again,'' and let every loyal Maine
grad _ not man _ sing.
   Vallee attended the university in the '20s and made the song a
hit in the '30s. Narkowsky's version is to go before an as-yet
unchosen committee that will recommend whether the changes are in
order.
   There are strong feelings on both sides of the issue. ``It's the
only school fight song to ever make the top 40,'' said Tom
Caulfield, a junior who calls the proposed word changes ``stupid.''

<HEAD>More Than 1,000 Leaking Chemical Weapons Discovered</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army's problem with aging chemical weapons
is likely to worsen in future years unless the outdated stockpile
is destroyed, say officials who report that more than 1,000 of the
weapons have sprung leaks.
   Army officials who reported the figure on Tuesday said it
represents only ``a small percentage'' of the American arsenal, but
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, was still worried.
   ``That's frightening: 1,000 leakers,'' he said. ``That's a
serious problem.''
   Army officials agreed with Glenn when he said ``the problem is
not going to get less'' as the stockpile, already averaging 25
years old, continues to age.
   Acting on congressional orders, the Army has come up with a plan
to destroy the chemical weapons at the eight U.S. sites where they
are stored, but plans for local burning in closed incinerators face
some opposition, Army officials said.
   The leaking weapons are quickly enclosed in newer, safer
containers, Brig. Gen. David Nydam told the Senate Armed Services
subcommittee on strategic weapons.
   Nydam said the number of leaking weapons is only ``a small
percentage'' of the total U.S. stockpile, but he declined to
publicize the size of the stockpile, telling the subcommittee the
figure is classified. Published reports have estimated the
stockpile, by weight, at between 25,000 and 40,000 tons.
   The current U.S. stockpile, which was built before 1969,
consists of unitary weapons, which include artillery shells and
bombs filled with a variety of chemicals and nerve gases.
   The Army is now starting to manufacture newer chemical weapons,
known as binary weapons because they are composed of two chemicals
kept separate until the shell is fired or bomb is dropped.
   As part of the compromise that ended a long fight with Congress
over whether to build new chemical weapons, the Army agreed to come
up with a plan to destroy the old stockpile. The incineration plan
will cost $2.7 billion and take until 1997, service officials said.
   Army officials say almost all the current stockpile is so old
that the weapons are militarily useless.
   The weapons are stored at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.;
Anniston Army Depot, Ala.; Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Ky.;
Newport Army Ammunition Plant, Ind.; Pine Bluff Arsenal, Ark.;
Pueblo Army Depot, Colo.; Tooele Army Depot, Utah; and Umatilla
Army Depot, Ore.
   U.S. chemical weapons are also based in West Germany and stored
on Johnston Atoll, a deserted island about 400 miles south of
Hawaii.
   The Army says the safest method of destruction is incineration
in closed containers at the eight sites, a plan opposed by
communities in some of the areas.
   John Shannon, assistant secretary of the Army, said residents of
the areas around the Aberdeen, Newport and Lexington storage sites
have objected to the incineration plans. At the other five sites,
he said, residents ``have expressed the desire that we get on with
it.''
   Shannon was told by Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., that the Army
should do a better job of selling its plan to the public.
   ``There's been some progress (in swaying public opinion), but
we've got a long way to go,'' Quayle said. ``We in the Senate
become involved when our constituency feels it is shortchanged.''
   Shannon admitted mistakes were made at the site in Quayle's
state. ``We did not do a good job in Newport in the beginning,'' he
said. ``We'll have to do better.''
   Other destruction options considered by the Army included
transportation of all the weapons by rail to Tooele, where they
would be burned; or transportation of some to Tooele and others to
Anniston. But both those plans involve movement of the weapons
through at least 16 other states and opposition would likely
surface in some of those states, Shannon said.

<TEXT>
   A 16-year-old gang member has been arrested
in connection with a Good Friday shooting that left one dead and 11
injured and triggered the Police Department's all-out war on
drug-dealing gangs.
   In another development, five members of the crime fighting group
Guardian Angels, including group founder, Curtis Sliwa, were
arrested as they allegedly attempted to force their way into the
offices of a studio producing a movie they say glorifies gangs.
   Police said Tuesday the teen-ager was arrested Monday and will
be charged with murder. The youth was not identified because he is
a juvenile, but police said he is a known gang member.
   ``He was very belligerent and portrayed himself, as I've said,
as a real bad guy, until he was informed that he was being arrested
and booked for murder, whereupon he broke down and cried like the
big coward that he really is,'' police Chief Daryl Gates said of
the youth.
   Police were seeking two other people in the April 1 shooting,
which killed a 19-year-old man and wounded 11 others, including a
child.
   The City Council Tuesday voted $4.5 million in police overtime
to help the department continue its onslaught on gangs through
June. The police effort includes steps such as the 1,000-officer
task force that hit the streets last weekend and arrested 1,453
people, 794 of them gang members.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner said the police sweeps, done at an
estimated nightly cost of $150,000, have helped disrupt gang
activity and heighten public awareness.
   The district attorney's office has filed charges on 59 out of
118 cases submitted from the sweeps arrests, a ratio Reiner said is
about average for felony cases. The others were rejected for
insufficient evidence, said Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay.
   Earlier Tuesday, six of eight reputed gang members arrested in
the weekend sweep pleaded innocent to narcotics charges.
   Despite the crackdown, four people were killed in drive-by
shootings over the weekend and nine others were injured,
authorities said.
   Meanwhile, Sliwa and four other Guardian Angels were arrested as
they allegedly attempted to force their way into the offices of
Orion Pictures in Century City.
   The Guardian Angels have been protesting Friday's scheduled
release of the movie ``Colors.'' The five were booked for battery
after allegedly pushing and tackling security guards, and were
being held on $500 bail each, said police Sgt. B.P. Kelepecz.
   Despite protests by the Angels and other groups, Reiner said he
believes the film may galvanize public support for the war on gangs.
   ``This is not West Side Story revisited,'' Reiner said of the
movie. ``These are not darlings who are going to dance their way
into your heart. These are sociopathic killers.''

   The meteorologist atop Mount
Washington breezily observed the anniversary of the world's record
wind speed by phoning his counterpart who clocked the 231-mph wind
54 years ago.
   ``I wished him a happy wind day,'' said Greg Gordon, who phoned
Alex McKenzie on Tuesday. McKenzie was in the observatory at 1:21
p.m., April 12, 1934, when the southeast blast was recorded _ the
fastest measured on the surface of the planet.
   At 1:21 p.m. Tuesday, the wind was a mere 2 mph, ``which is
highly unusual,'' Gordon said.
   The 6,288-foot mountain has some of the world's harshest
weather. Its hurricane-force winds (above 74 mph) are registered an
average 100 days a year. The average annual snowfall is 178 inches.
   The coldest it has ever been on the mountain is minus 47
degrees, the warmest 71 degrees. Snow falls on the mountain in
every month and the peak is socked in by clouds 30 days a year.

   It was a sight to behold, even by New York
standards: 19 elephants parading through midtown Manhattan toward
Central Park to nosh on celery, carrots, cabbages _ and bagels.
   Tuesday's was the first midday circus elephant parade through
Manhattan in more than a decade, and was staged to exercise the
pachyderms and publicize the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey
Circus.
   The clown-flanked elephants, led by Ringmaster Jim Ragona and
carrying brightly clad showgirls, entered the park's Great Lawn to
the cheers of schoolchildren for the picnic.
   ``What I like about these elephants is that they're New York
elephants,'' said Mayor Edward I. Koch as he poked food into the
maw of a huge beast named Jewel. ``They like bagels.''

   The country music classic ``Walking the
Floor over You,'' has nothing on a singer who's so desperate to
perform for the Grand Ole Opry that he's walking 1,500 miles to
plead for a chance at the spotlight.
   David Stewart, 37, of Gillette, Wyo., plans to leave home on
April 30 and arrive in Nashville, the home of the Opry, on July 22.
   ``I'll show them I'm serious,'' Stewart said by telephone
Tuesday from his home. ``I respect country music and the people in
it. I think they will appreciate what I'm doing.''
   Stewart, a guitarist who's been singing part time for 20 years,
plans to walk eight to 10 hours daily covering 20 to 30 miles.
   Jerry Strobel, manager of the Grand Ole Opry House, said Opry
performers are usually established entertainers, and the Opry
usually refers aspiring singers to The Nashville Network's ``You
Can Be A Star'' show on cable TV.
   ``If I don't get on, the worst thing is that I will have lost a
little weight,'' Stewart said. ``Of course I'll be disappointed.
But I will have accomplished at least part of what I set out to do.
If a person has a dream and doesn't go after it, you're just idle.''

   A key legal decision puts the National
Archives one step closer to letting the public see presidential
papers that Richard M. Nixon wants kept secret.
   The decision Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
knocks down a Reagan administration attempt to force the Archives
to honor automatically all Nixon claims of executive privilege.
   It restores a regulation that says an Archives review board will
study disputes over executive privilege claimed by Nixon and that
the former president must go to court if he wants to overturn a
board decision.
   Although 3{ million pages of Nixon documents have been opened to
researchers, Nixon and his lawyers have been able to withhold
150,000 documents by claiming they involved executive privilege,
private political associations, personal property or personal
privilege.
   A representative of Nixon's lawyers spent three years in the
Archives warehouse in Alexandria, Va., identifying documents to be
excluded from public view. The requests for exemption from
disclosure totaled 3,100 pages and the protected papers represent
about 10 percent of the 1.5 million pages in the so-called Nixon
Special Files, which contained the most sensitive documents.
   The Justice Department did not decide immediately whether to
carry the case to the Supreme Court. ``We've got 90 days to make
any decision,'' said Michael Carvin, a Justice Department lawyer
who helped prepare the appeal of a lower court decision.
   Gary Brooks, legal counsel for the Archives, said processing of
Nixon documents had continued while the case was in the court. The
Archives must now set up a Presidential Materials Review Board
consisting of the archivist, two assistant archivists, the legal
counsel, and a historian of a federal agency.
   ``The problem is (Nixon's) objections tend to overlap,'' Brooks
said. ``On one document there may be three different types of
objections.''
   Congress seized the papers _ 42 million pages and 880 tape
recordings _ in 1974 after Nixon resigned from the presidency. The
act directed that they be made public to disclose ``the full
truth'' about Watergate.
   There followed years of legal wrangling over access regulations.
Five sets of rules were invalidated for various reasons. When the
sixth set _ the regulations now in effect _ was presented to the
Reagan administration, the Justice Department's Office of Legal
Counsel added what the court called ``its gloss'' to the rules.
   The OLC demanded that if either an incumbent president or Nixon
were to claim executive privilege for any document ``the archivist
would be obliged to honor that claim.'' The rule put the burden of
challenging that decision on the person requesting the material.
   Tuesday's action reverses that procedure.
   ``Ronald Reagan, not Richard Nixon is the constitutional
superior of the archivist,'' the court said in its ruling. ``Ronald
Reagan has the constitutional power to direct the archivist, not
Richard Nixon.''
   The ruling said Nixon must ask to withhold documents ``on a
disclosure-by-disclosure basis.'' It also rejected Nixon's claim
that someone requesting the materials must show a particular need
for them.
   The opinion was written by Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman, a
Reagan administration appointee who has supported expanding
executive branch authority since joining the court. Most recently,
he wrote an opinion striking down the law providing that
independent counsels rather than the Justice Department would
investigate executive branch officials accused of wrongdoing.

<BYLINE>WASHINGTON WIRE: How Could Dukakis Lose New York?
^By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The question for Michael Dukakis this week is
the classic one for a front-runner: it is not ``How can he win the
New York primary?'' but ``How could he lose it?''
   The answer, of course, is ``very easily.'' Presidential politics
is a particularly uncertain occupation, and much can happen before
next Tuesday's primary.
   But now the Massachusetts governor is looking strong in the
Empire State.
   For the first time outside of New England, Dukakis is showing
the depth and breadth of support that a politician needs to become
the Democratic party's presidential nominee.
   And his rivals _ Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr. _ are
fighting powerful negative feelings among Democratic voters in New
York that make it difficult for either to catch Dukakis.
   There are seven days of intensive media coverage of every
candidates' utterance left before the ballots are cast. And the
candidates are spending millions of dollars on television ads to
reach the voters.
   A major gaffe could wipe out Dukakis' lead. Or a particularly
compelling move by Gore or Jackson could sway the voters into their
column.
   The latest Marist Institute poll, taken April 5-6, gave Dukakis
a 47-31 lead over Jackson, with Gore picking up only 6 percent. An
uncommitted slate drew 8 percent, 6 percent were undecided and the
remainder were scattered.
   ``It's what I call the 20-20 question,'' said pollster Lee
Miringoff at Marist College. ``If Jackson gets 20 percent of the
white vote and Gore and uncommitted together get 20 percent...then
you've got a dead heat'' for Dukakis and Jackson.
   In the Marist poll, Dukakis drew 60 percent of the likely white
voters; Jackson, 14 percent; Gore, 8 percent; and uncommitted, 6
percent.
   ``Gore is the wild card,'' Miringoff said.
   In a state as diverse as New York, one can always quibble about
this or that finding in a poll.
   For example, Jackson gets ``only'' 80 percent of the black vote
in the survey of 408 likely Democratic voters. Exit polls have
shown him getting closer to 95 percent of the black vote this year.
   If one gave Jackson every single black voter in the Marist
survey, it would narrow the gap to about 45-35 for Dukakis.
   If black voters actually total more than the 22 percent of the
likely electorate in the Marist survey, that would cut Dukakis'
margin further.
   And then one must look at the Jewish turnout, which usually runs
a fifth to a fourth of the Democratic primary voters.
   Here it is Gore who has not done as well thus far as he must,
despite his effort to cast himself as the strongest friend of
Israel in the contest. The Tennessee senator drew the backing of 13
percent of the Jewish voters, while Dukakis took 69 percent.
   Jackson has a particular problem with the Jewish vote, because
his statements on the Palestinian question and dealings with Arab
leaders have caused some to suggest that Jackson is anti-Semitic.
   Jackson and his supporters strongly reject such
characterizations, but those deep feelings against him are a
problem in New York.
   Dukakis' strength in New York is also reflected in the breadth
of his support.
   The Massachusetts governor wins the moderates and conservatives
and splits the liberals with Jackson. He holds majorities in the
New York City suburbs and upstate. Again, he splits New York City
with Jackson.
   He is leading among the two-thirds of the likely voters who are
not in union households, and runs even with Jackson among the union
members.
   Dukakis leads among each income group, except the poorest likely
voters.
   The good news for Dukakis actually stretches beyond New York.
   Provided he wins on April 19, the Massachusetts governor is
looking good in the big states coming up next on the primary
calendar.
   He is leading in the polls for Pennsylvania's April 26 primary.
Dukakis could get an added bonus there, since the state's process
of voting directly for delegates favors a strong organization,
offering him a chance for a big delegate win that is all but
impossible to achieve in most states.
   Dukakis is also leading in the polls on Ohio's May 3 primary,
where Jackson has had some ballot troubles with his delegate slates.

   In June, after a citywide contest, one of these women will be

reported Tuesday.
   Posters go up throughout the capital today to begin the hunt for
contestants to take part in Moscow's first beauty pageant, the
paper said.
   ``We already had the idea last year,'' the head of the leisure
center at Moscow's Gorky Park, M. Kafiyatulin, was quoted as
saying. ``But we still needed time to overcome the barriers on the
way to making it a reality.''
   The paper didn't elaborate, but said Moscow was only the fourth
city in the country, after Odessa, Vilnius and Leningrad, to hold a
beauty contest.

<HEAD>50 State Attorneys General Petitioned to Halt Audi Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charges of deception are flying between safety
advocates and Audi importers following a consumer coalition's
request that all 50 states prohibit advertisements claiming that
the cars are unusually safe.
   Three consumer groups made the request in petitions sent Tuesday
to the attorney general in each of the states.
   The Center for Auto Safety of Washington, the Audi Victims
Network of Plainview, N.Y., and the New York Public Interest
Research Group said Audi of America misled consumers in
advertisements published in March and April declaring the Audi 5000
is ``among the safest cars in the U.S.''
   ``We ask that you put an end to this deceptive advertising by
Audi,'' said the petitions.
   The organizations said at least one out of every 145 Audi 5000s
sold in the United States has experienced sudden acceleration
problems in which the car accelerates for no apparent reason.
   Audi's U.S. parent company, Volkswagen of America Inc., in turn
accused the safety advocates of distorting numbers to mislead the
public.
   ``It is bloody near criminal, the way they're playing with
numbers,'' said Joseph Bennett, Volkswagen spokesman in Troy, Mich.
``That's a baldfaced lie, and they know it.''
   Audi last year recalled 255,336 of its 1978-86 Audi 5000s for
installation of a shift-lock device to fix reported throttle
problems on the cars. The devices keeps a driver from putting the
car in gear unless the brake is depressed.
   The consumers groups allege driver complaints show the device
doesn't prevent unintended acceleration.
   They said each incident of unintended acceleration ``carries
with it the potential for loss of life and serious injuries;
indeed, already at least five people have died and over 2,000 have
had the daylights scared out of them as a result of Audis running
amuck.''
   Bennett argued that a complaint of sudden acceleration does not
necessarily mean such a problem actually occurred.
   The company, in documents filed this week with National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, analyzed 394 reports of unintended
acceleration involving cars equipped with the shift-lock device. It
said it found that all but 22 of the reports were flawed.

   CBS got a consolation prize _ a tie with NBC _
in the second-to-last week of the season that will mark CBS' first
time as a third-place finisher in the prime-time A.C. Nielsens Co.
ratings race.
   Last week's tie was the closest CBS has come all season to
winning a week. NBC has won 24 weeks of the 29 weeks of the season.
ABC won the others with special sporting events like the World
Series and the Winter Olympics.
   For the week that ended Sunday, NBC and CBS had average,
prime-time ratings of 14.0. ABC had an 11.2. With one week left,
NBC is set to win its third consecutive season. It has an average
16.1 rating for the 29 weeks; ABC's is 13.7, and CBS 13.5.
   CBS got a boost Monday night from the NCAA championship
basketball game, which got an 18.8 rating and 30 share and was
seventh in the rankings.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   CBS also was helped on Sunday night when its lineup of ``60
Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and the movie ``Red River'' all
made it into the top 10.
   The second half of NBC's low-rated, two-part miniseries ``The
Fortunate Pilgrim'' went up against the basketball game last Monday
and finished 34th.
   But NBC had the week's highest-rated movie, Raquel Welch's
``Scandal in a Small Town,'' which ranked fifth.
   With the onset of daylight-saving time, the evening newscasts
began what seems to be a typical summer slide in the ratings.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won the week that ended Friday with
a rating of 9.7 and a 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 9.3
and 20 share; ``NBC Nightly News'' 8.5 and 18. All three newscasts
dropped in ratings, indicating fewer viewers in front of their sets
in the early evening.
   In prime time, much of the week's lineup was made up of reruns
as the networks saved original episodes for the May sweeps.
   The top-rated shows of the week were: ``The Cosby Show'' NBC,
``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS, ``My Two Dads'' NBC, ``Cheers'' NBC,
``Scandal in a Small Town'' NBC, ``Golden Girls'' NBC, the NCAA
basketball championship on CBS, ``60 Minutes'' CBS, ``Red River''
CBS, and ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC.
   ABC's new ``The Wonder Years,'' was 11th. NBC's new ``In the
Heat of the Night'' ranked 15th.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Family Man,'' ``High
Mountain Rangers,'' ``Buck James,'' ``Our House,'' ``West 57th,''
``Highwayman,'' ``Probe,'' ``Hotel,'' ``Supercarrier'' and
``Ohara.''

<TEXT>
   A wide-open race for the Senate's top
Democratic leadership post is developing in the wake of Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd's decision to step aside after a decade as
his party's chief Senate strategist.
   Three senators immediately announced their intentions to
campaign to succeed the West Virginia Democrat.
   Byrd, 70, announced on Tuesday that he will seek election to a
sixth Senate term and, if he wins and his party retains Senate
control, use his seniority to claim the chairmanship of the Senate
Appropriations Committee.
   ``There is much to accomplish for my state in that capacity,''
Byrd said.
   Many in the chamber praised the work Byrd has done as Democratic
leader since 1977, noting his widely acknowledged mastery of the
legislative process, but a number of Democrats also agreed it was
time for a change. Byrd in recent years has been criticized by some
Democrats for his leadership style and for lacking a slick
television image.
   With the retirement of other senior Democrats this year, Byrd
will become his party's most senior member and serve as the
chamber's president pro tem if Democrats retain majority control.
   ``I believe I have been fair, firm and honest, and I have done
my best,'' Byrd told his fellow Democrats. ``Through a decade of
quiet labor I have led my party from the ambivalence of the Carter
years through the extremes of the Reagan administration.''
   Announcing their candidacies for the leadership post, to be
decided after the November elections, were Sens. George Mitchell,
D-Maine; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; and J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.
   Several senators said there is no clear front-runner.
   Inouye, who holds the Democrats' No. 3 leadership position, said
his prospects are ``very good'' despite criticism that while
serving as chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra committee last summer
he permitted Lt. Col. Oliver L. North to steal the show.
   Johnston, who challenged Byrd in 1986 but dropped out when it
became clear he could not win, said he is ``very encouraged'' even
though he does not yet have enough votes to win.
   ``No one does,'' Johnston said.
   The majority leader of the Senate is the controlling party's
chief strategist and spokesman and Johnston called the job ``an
opportunity without parallel.''
   Despite grumbling about his image, Byrd told reporters he had
great confidence he could have won because ``I know where the votes
are.''
   But according to congressional sources, Byrd had told some
senators in 1986 that if they supported him for the post then, he
would step aside when the two-year term expired.
   Byrd said he had agonized over the decision until the last
moment, not making up his mind until late Monday night.
   He told his colleagues he had tried to give the Senate a voice
of ``resonance and power'' in the nation's affairs.
   Many senators said they believed he had accomplished that.
   But many also said they thought it was time for a change.
   Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., told reporters the likelihood of
Byrd's running again ``seemed to fade over the past year.''
   At the moment, Melcher added, there is ``no clear indication of
who might be first, or second or even last.''
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said: ``The time for change I
think is appropriate.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Byrd made himself
``the grand master of Senate rules and procedure.''
   ``He is one tough ball carrier for his party,'' Dole said.
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
said that when Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 1980,
Byrd ``helped fashion and execute a legislative strategy that
moderated the excesses of Ronald Reagan, George Bush and the
radical right.''
   Since he first entered the Senate 30 years ago, Byrd forged a
reputation as a courtly master parliamentarian who revered the
Senate and its history and gained power inch by inch by attending
to his colleagues' smallest wishes.
   He called in those favors in 1971, ousting Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., from the No. 2 party post. Byrd succeeded Sen.
Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., as majority leader in 1977.

   Greek-Americans in upstate New York
state are doing just as their counterparts elsewhere in the United
States and rallying behind the presidential campaign of one of
their own: Michael Dukakis.
   ``If a man is good in his work, native Greeks, they'll always
stick with him,'' said Peter Apostol, a 72-year-old Greek-American
who works for his son in a restaurant supply business in Green
Island.
   ``I think it's strong,'' said the son, Michael, 42, of the
grass-roots sentiment for Dukakis. ``I think a lot of Greeks are
donating money. A lot are excited that one of our own is running.
The Greeks would like to see a Greek-American and an ethnic, a
hyphenated-American, in control of the presidency. It's no
different than why blacks support Jesse Jackson.''
   Dukakis, the son of immigrants, will get a big boost from
Greek-Americans who are also registered Democrats in New York's
primary on Tuesday. And should he be the party's nominee in the
general election in November, some Republicans and independents say
they will cross over to vote for him just because he's Greek.
   Among those ready to bolt the GOP for Dukakis is Jimmy Londis,
64, who came to the United States from Greece 30 years ago and runs
the popular Jimmy's Lunch in Troy, known for its French toast.
   ``I feel very warm about him,'' said Londis. ``He's the right
kind of person. He's a good governor. If it's going to be (Jesse)
Jackson and (George) Bush, I've got to vote Republican.''
   The Rev. Emmanuel Mantzouris, pastor of St. Basil Greek Orthodox
Church in Troy whose congregation numbers about 250, said many
Greeks are politically oriented. ``Just knowing he's Greek draws
their attention, somebody being Greek in the limelight.''
   As much as 25 percent of the $15 million that Dukakis has raised
in campaign funds has come from Greek-Americans, estimated to
number one million.
   ``A lot about the Dukakis candidacy stimulates
Greek-Americans,'' says Elias Vlanton, information director of the
American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association. ``He invokes
his Greek heritage and the values that Greeks hold dear _ love of
family, the need and importance of public service.''
   Paul Brountas, a Greek-American who is Dukakis' national
campaign chairman, acknowledges there may be some voters who will
support him just because of his heritage. But just the same, he
says, Dukakis has to prove himself on the issues first.
   ``There's no automatic vote or contribution to Dukakis just
because he's Greek,'' says Brountas. ``I believe the majority of
Greek supporters hear his message. The gap between what you know
about a candidate and don't know is often bridged either by
familiarity or a tie so he starts with the heritage connection.''
   One ardent supporter, John Oureilidis, a 40-year-old bowling
equipment supplier from Troy, believes what Dukakis says.
   ``Plus he's Greek,'' says Oureilidis. ``He talks sense. Nobody
talks about poor people like he does. I believe he can do it. He's
our boy so we have to vote for him.''
   But still there are some dissenters among Greek-Americans like
Michael Wilson, 31, who is in the printing business, and his
brother, George, 29, a continuity director for a radio station in
Schenectady. Both are diehard Republicans. And for good reason. In
1984, before moving to Schenectady, Michael Wilson was chairman of
the Fulton County Reagan-Bush Committee.

<HEAD>Democrats Rely On Ads In New York Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson is mounting his first major
television drive of the presidential campaign season for next
week's New York primary, and he'll kick it off with an anti-drug ad
produced by filmmaker Spike Lee.
   Jackson spokesman Eric Easter said Tuesday that the campaign
expects to purchase TV time worth about $500,000 _ 10 times more
than what Jackson spent on media for the April 5 Wisconsin primary
in which he placed second.
   ``We plan to run a number of commercials,'' Easter said. ``We
haven't decided which ones to use and when to run them. We've just
decided a ballpark figure on how much we're willing to spend.''
   Despite the huge jump in Jackson's media spending, the civil
rights activist probably won't match the TV effort planned by
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. Gore spokesman Mark Armour said the
campaign had made a third media buy Tuesday and ``we're still
intending to run a million-plus campaign in New York.''
   Steve Akey, a spokesman for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
declined to say how much the campaign is spending other than that
``we can be and we will be competitive with everybody in New York.''
   Asked if Dukakis would match or outspend his rivals, Akey
replied: ``It's not always necessary. We didn't spend the most
money in Wisconsin. You have to be very careful about targeting
your dollar.''
   Jackson has relied mainly on energetic campaigning and heavy
news coverage in past contests. But he took in more than $2 million
in March after strong showings in several states, assuring him the
means to project a stronger media presence in the expensive and
high-stakes New York contest.
   The new Jackson ad, shot Monday, shows Jackson and Lee walking
down a New York street. Lee comments on the sad state of the
neighborhood and the devastating impact of drugs on the streets,
and Jackson responds with a discussion of his anti-drug positions.
   According to Easter, in Lee's movie, ``She's Gotta Have It,''
Lee's character mentions having met Jackson and told him to run for
president. Lee has been a Jackson supporter for some time.
   Easter said other new ads would be made from filming done last
week while Jackson was campaigning in Brooklyn. He said the
campaign may also use endorsement spots that have proven effective
in the past _ one by entertainer Bill Cosby and another by a farmer
who says Jackson helped him save his farm.
   Gore had been running a biographical ad, another stressing his
experience as a Vietnam veteran and a third proposing that the
military be mobilized to fight drugs. Armour said the biography was
pulled Tuesday and a new ad on trade was scheduled to start upstate
and downstate on Tuesday night.
   Dukakis, on a roll after trouncing Jackson in Wisconsin, was
running three ads throughout New York, one of them a biography, one
emphasizing his experience as a chief executive and the third
emphasizing the war against drugs.
   The second, a variation on a spot he has used in several states,
says he is the only candidate to have balanced a budget, created
new jobs, built affordable housing and provided job training and
child care.
   The third, which began airing on Tuesday, included excerpts from
a speech in which Dukakis attacked the Reagan administration's
support until recently of Panamanian military strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   ``How can we tell our children to say `no' to drugs when we have
an administration that paid $200,000 a year to a drug-peddling
dictator from Panama?'' Dukakis says.

   Trident submarine parts that fell into the Irish
Sea from a cargo ship two months ago have been recovered, the Press
Association reported. The five parts, worth $1.2 million, were lost
Feb. 5 and 6 off Wolney Island near Barrow-in-Furness in northeast
England.
   The parts, salvaged by an unidentified insurance company, appear
to be undamaged and have been returned to the Motherwell Bridge
steel manufacturers in Glasgow, Scotland, where they were made, the
Press Association said Tuesday.
   The forward dome section for a Trident missile-carrying,
Vanguard-class submarine was lost during a storm on Feb. 5. The
next day, four submarine deck sections fell overboard from the same
cargo ship for unknown reasons.
   The parts were being sent to a shipbuilding company in Barrow.

<HEAD>US Urges UN Relief Program for Afghan Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Afghan refugees heading home when
Soviet troops withdraw will need United Nations-run relief services
because of continued upheaval in Afghanistan, U.S. officials say.
   Further mediation efforts also will be needed to arrange an
interim government to replace the Soviet-backed regime, according
to the officials. ``A constructive effort is taking place to work
out an interim government and to help the refugees return in safety
and honor,'' State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
Tuesday.
   ``The process has to be done in such a way that it's done
securely, that these people are taken care of,'' he said.
   ``There is obviously going to be some social disorganization
inside Afghanistan as this proceeds,'' he said. ``We need to try to
do this in a coordinated way.''
   He said the United Nations is the ``logical'' organization to
coordinate the work.
   Refugee resettlement and political maneuvering to set the shape
of future rule in Afghanistan have emerged as the next major issues
in the region, as the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops prepare to
withdraw.
   Under accords to be signed in Geneva on Thursday, the troops
will be out of the country by early next year, ending an eight-year
Soviet military domination of the Afghan government.
   The accords, to be signed at a ceremony attended by Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, also envision a non-aligned Afghanistan,
the return of the refugees and a peaceful Afghan-Pakistani border.
   Diego Cordovez, the United Nations mediator who led the
settlement discussions, is expected to continue _ in a private
capacity _ to work for a further understanding between the
U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas and the Soviet-sponsored government
in Kabul.
   Complicating the problem is a superpower agreement to continue
aiding their clients in the country after the Soviet troops
withdraw.
   The United States had hoped to reach agreement with the Soviets
to cut all aid to the belligerents, but when Moscow insisted on its
right to assist the Kabul government, the United States said it
would continue helping the resistance forces.
   President Reagan sought on Tuesday to assure a group of U.S.
supporters of the Afghan resistance that the American commitment
would continue after the Soviets withdraw.
   ``The president told us repeatedly and in very definitive terms
that he is going to stand by the Afghan freedom fighters no matter
what,'' said Paul Weyrich, president of the Free Congress
Foundation. Leaders of the Afghan insurgents have vowed to continue
the war and with the spring thaw opening mountain supply routes,
Western diplomats in Pakistan have reported an increase in military
activity in Afghanistan.
   Renewed fighting has been reported near the large cities of
Kandahar and Khost and Soviet army forces continue to operate in
strength, the diplomats said.
   State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said continued fighting would affect the return of the refugees,
but one expert said the removal of Soviet forces from the fray
would spark a massive return.
   ``The likelihood of continued violence does not frighten the
Afghan people,'' this official said.
   ``What made them flee in the first place was not the violence,
it was the magnitude of the violence, namely attacks from the
Soviet air force, napalm attacks, helicopter raids on villages.
   ``When that ends they will want to return,'' he said.

   Six prisoners ended a rebellion
and freed four hostages from a prison in northeastern Brazil.
   Ricardo Leitao, spokesman for the Pernambuco state governor's
office, said the inmates surrendered on Tuesday at the Anibal Bruni
prison in Recife, the state capital, which is 1,500 miles northeast
of Rio.
   ``There was no problem with the surrender. The police guaranteed
their physical safety, and they threw out their knives and then
their guns and released the hostages,'' Leitao said in a televised
interview from Recife.
   Two priests and a nun held as hostages were released unharmed.
The fourth hostage, a prison guard, had been shot in the leg while
trying to escape.
   The rebellion began Saturday during Mass at the 300-inmate,
medium-security prison. The inmates took two priests, two nuns and
two guards hostage and demanded handguns, rifles, ammunition,
handcuffs, two cars and $10,000.
   They later released a nun in exchange for water and one guard
escaped.

   An estate auction of pianist Liberace's
often-gaudy possessions netted more than $2 million, a spokeswoman
for the group conducting the sale said Tuesday.
   On the final day of the auction, the flamboyant entertainer's
fleet of cars was sold, with five of them purchased by the Imperial
Palace hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nev.
   Among the vehicles purchased for the Palace was a 1966
Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow with sable and gold coach lining for
$46,000.
   Proceeds of the auction will go to the non-profit Liberace
Foundation for the Performing and Creative Arts, which provides
scholarships at 28 schools and colleges nationwide.
   Robert Nye, a piano dealer from Redding, Penn., paid $22,100 for
one of Liberace's pianos on the first day of the auction. On
Tuesday, he paid $11,000 for a fox coat once worn by the pianist.
   He also bought a van owned by the entertainer that was decorated
on the side with a painting of the pianist's trademark piano and
candelabra arrangement, said Alexandra Destler, spokeswoman for
Butterfield & Butterfield, which conducted the sale.
   The four-day auction, which began Saturday, took in $2.08
million, Ms. Destler said.
   Liberace's driver's license, forecast to garner no more than
$200, went for $4,150 Sunday.
   Many bidders at the Los Angeles Convention Center auction
purchased items as investments, but many were fans who came to pay
respects to Wladziu (Walter) Valentino Liberace, who died Feb. 4,
1987, of complications of AIDS. He was 67.

   The president of Denison University
banished two white students from campus for the rest of the
academic year for making racial slurs to a black student, a
university spokesman said Tuesday.
   University President Andrew De Rocco ordered the two students to
leave the campus by 5 p.m. Wednesday, said spokesman Stewart Dyke.
   The students had been found guilty by the university's judicial
board of harassing Aaron Laramore, a black senior, by pounding on
the wall of his dormitory room and yelling racial epithets. The two
students live adjacent to Laramore.
   The board had ordered the white students suspended for the
coming fall semester, but black students claimed that punishment
was too lenient and called for a boycott of classes and organized
protest rallies. The suspension remains in effect, Dyke said.
   Jay Freeborne, a student from Upper Marlboro, Md., said the
incident has consumed the campus of 2,100 students about 25 miles
northeast of Columbus. He said instructors have given over class
time to discussions of racism.

   Cable mogul Ted Turner has more on his mind
these days than making money. He's hoping to save mankind from
nuclear destruction.
   Turner's Better World Society, founded in 1985, is sponsoring a
series of television programs on such subjects as overpopulation
and nuclear proliferation, and the most recent is ``The Terror
Trade: Buying the Bomb,'' airing tonight and again Saturday on
SuperStation TBS.
   The content of the one-hour documentary is impressive, not to
mention scary.
   The centerpiece is an interview with ``Eric,'' a man who claims
to be a former arms dealer who traded in black-market plutonium,
sought by many Third World nations as well as terrorist
organizations wanting to build their own nuclear weapons.
   George Case, the British investigative reporter who reported and
co-produced the documentary, says Eric's credibility was verified
by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, for whom he once worked as an
informant.
   At one point, Eric describes a ``flea market'' at a hotel in
Khartoum, Sudan, where 12 kilos of stolen weapons-grade plutonium
were up for sale _ stored at the airport, not in the hotel. Buyers,
Eric said, came from South Africa, Libya, Israel, Iraq, Iran,
Pakistan, Argentina and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Eric said he was negotiating on behalf of South Africa and
unsuccessfully offered $5 million a kilo for the stuff. He said he
heard later that the plutonium was sold to Iraq. A few months after
the sale, in June 1981, Israeli jets destroyed an Iraqi nuclear
research plant.
   Richard Perle, former assistant secretary of defense in the
Reagan administration, is interviewed and says that while other
countries publicly deplored the Israeli attack, many nations
privately applauded it.
   Other officials interviewed include former President Jimmy
Carter and former CIA Director Stansfield Turner.
   The documentary suggests that U.S.-Soviet cooperation is the
best way to stop proliferation.
   Turner said he thinks it's a simple case of U.S. and Soviet
leadership.
   ``That threat's always there: `We can nuke you and you can't
nuke us back,' and it really makes the little countries angry,''
said Turner. ``That's the ultimate status symbol in the world
today. It's just awful. We set a terrible example, us and the
Soviets, but the Soviets want to get rid of nuclear weapons, and so
does the Better World Society, at least the chairman does.''
   Turner he created the society to finance controversial
television projects about world population problems and the nuclear
threat that couldn't draw advertisers.
   ``I've got five children,'' he said. ``Humanity is the most
endangered species on the planet, and it bothers the devil out of
me. I've just got a lot of pride. I like to see things better. I go
around pickin' up trash on my places on the weekend. It kills me to
see the trash on the side of the highway.
   ``And to see all the wonderful people in this world _ I've been
over to the Soviet Union and met the people over there, and they're
just as nice as the people here in the United States, and that's
true of the people in Iran and Israel and everywhere. It's all
misunderstanding. That's all it is.''
   Turner's simplistic approach to world peace isn't always
successful. The seven-part series ``Inside the Soviet Union'' was
largely dismissed by critics as too naive, showing lots of happy
Soviets and ignoring serious issues such as religious suppression
and persecution of those who seek to emigrate.
   Turner insisted that was the aim of the program, to counteract a
negative Soviet image in the United States.
   Turner feels so strongly about world peace, he has directed that
his Cable News Network in news reports use the term
``international'' instead of than ``foreign.''
   ``It's not really foreign, it's news from other parts of the
Earth,'' he said. ``We really should save the word foreign for
meteorites and things that come from outer space, because nothing
is foreign on this planet. We've already done it at CNN _
`international' instead of `foreign.'''

   Twice in the past week small groups of academics
have staged protests on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing,
daringly placing their careers on the line.
   Their message to the government: Give more money to education.
   One group came with shoeshine kits to parody government
suggestions that students and faculty work to supplement the
schools' meager budgets.
   Another group came with signs in English and Chinese, saying:
``We want more money for education.''
   At Beijing University, China's most prestigious, posters have
appeared saying that current financial strictures have made it
``useless to study,'' just as political oppression did during the
Cultural Revolution of 1965-75.
   The academics timed their protests to coincide with the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, which today concluded an
annual 20-day session.
   Although the shoeshiners were quickly escorted by police off the
square, officers allowed the sit-in by 19 students and teachers.
More important, delegates to the congress acknowledged the
protesters' grievances are real.
   Xu Jialu, a delegate and vice president of Beijing Normal
University, questioned the congress about the policy whereby
associate professors earn $33 a month: ``Is he or she worth so
little?''
   Shanghai delegates spoke of the ``devaluation'' of
intellectuals, and former congress Vice Chairman Zhou Gucheng said
some academics can't even afford to buy dictionaries. ``All this
should not continue if the country wishes to develop,'' he said.
   The response to the protests has been markedly different from
the conservative backlash that followed much larger pro-democracy
student demonstrations in December 1986 and January 1987.
   At that time, students were arrested and Hu Yaobang, the
Communist Party head, was purged from his post.
   Since then political activism has died out on campuses, with
students cowed by increased surveillance and threats of poor job
assignments upon graduation.
   The recent protests have avoided trouble because they have
stayed away from politically sensitive areas. They also came at a
time when some powerful officials are pushing for more money for
education.
   The current government of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and
Communist Party head Zhao Ziyang has recognized that intellectuals
are crucial to the nation's economic development and has tried to
raise their social status.
   Last year, millions of teachers and scientists were given 10
percent pay raises, their first in years.
   But Xu Pei, a young teacher demonstrating on Tiananmen Square on
Sunday, told Canadian Television that living conditions for
teachers remain ``terribly poor, you can't imagine. For instance, a
whole family with three or four or five members living in a small
room about 10 square meters (110 square feet).''
   Xu, who said he earns $24 a month, considerably less than a
manual laborer at a profitable factory, said he didn't want special
treatment for teachers.
   ``We only want teachers to get equal pay with other walks of
society. We think we are low, we are mistreated.''
   Educators say inadequate state funding for China's 640,000
undergraduate and 45,000 graduate students is seriously undermining
academic achievment.
   The state allocates around $485 a year for an undergraduate and
$1,080 to $1,620 for research students.
   Funding for education is to be boosted by 12 percent this year,
but much of that is for the daunting task of improving
elementary-level education in rural areas where 200 million people,
20 percent of all Chinese, remain illiterate.
   Party chief Zhao has told institutes of higher education that
they will have to fend for themselves, saying it is ``necessary and
possible'' for them to earn money by setting up factories and
providing other services to society.
   The State Education Commission also has proposed the financial
crunch be eased by having students, who now receive basically free
educations, pay their own tuition and be responsible for finding
their own jobs when they graduate.
   By 1993, according to one plan, 70 percent of undergraduates
will be paying tuition or will be sponsored by companies that will
hire them after their studies are completed.
   The reform, also designed to motivate students to study more, is
generally accepted as necessary. But qualms remain.
   ``Students,'' said demonstrator Xu, ``now can't see any future
for them because upon graduation they can't hope to make as much
money as a worker.''

   The Federal Aviation Administration's
ambitious modernization of its air traffic control system will cost
billions of dollars more than the agency estimates because of
unforeseen technical problems and delays, a congressional report
says.
   Largely because of unexpected problems in developing and
installing the new communications, radar, weather observation and
computer systems, the upgrading will cost at least $24 billion, the
General Accounting Office told Congress Tuesday.
   The FAA, which operates the air traffic control system and is
obtaining the new equipment, acknowledges that the program has
fallen behind schedule but has put the expected cost at $15.3
billion.
   ``Many of these technologies had to be invented, and the FAA
underestimated how long it would take to invent some of these
things,'' Kenneth M. Mead, an associate director of GAO, told the
House transportation appropriations subcommittee.
   The report by GAO, Congress' investigative arm, also said
hundreds of pieces of equipment that are being delivered to FAA
facilities across the country are simply sitting in sheds because
the agency lacks enough workers to install them.
   ``It's like ordering a piano and not having a living room to put
it in,'' said Rep. William Lehman, D-Fla., chairman of the
subcommittee.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said in an interview after the
hearing that the GAO figures were ``misleading,'' but acknowledged
that the plan, introduced in 1981, is running behind its original
timetable.
   The GAO report focused on the National Airspace System plan, the
second largest civilian technology project ever undertaken in the
United States, behind only the Apollo manned spacecraft program.
   Federal officials believe the new equipment is necessary to keep
up with the continuing growth of aviation, the fastest growing
segment of American transportation.
   The FAA originally hoped the new equipment would be in place by
1996. But officials now concede that because of delays, the project
will not be completed until at least the year 2000.
   The study by GAO said that of the 12 major systems that comprise
the modernization project, only one _ a computer _ is nearing
completion. Major components have been delayed from between one
year and five years, the report said.
   Reagan administration officials have blamed many of the delays
on the slowness of federal purchasing procedures, and on a refusal
by Congress to provide enough money to buy the equipment.
   Meanwhile, a broad coalition of aviation groups, aircraft
manufacturers and airlines called on not only the industry but air
travelers to put pressure on the government to expand airspace and
airport capacity.
   The coalition, forming a group called Partnership for Improved
Air Travel, announced a two-year campaign to enlist grassroots
support for spending more money on airports and improvements in the
air traffic control system.
   The air traffic modernization plan must be put ``on a fast
track'' and new airports must be built or air travelers will face
declining service, mounting delays and travel problems in the
coming years, the coalition warned at a news conference.
   ``Unless we modernize the (air traffic system) quickly, we'll
choke off growth to the detriment of all,'' declared Robert
Crandall, chairman of American Airlines.
   Crandall was among five airline chief executives, and leaders of
groups representing aircraft manufacturers, business flyers,
private and commercial pilots and airport officials who attended a
news conference announcing the campaign.
   The group envisions spending up to $15 million over the next two
years to publicize the need for more airports and an improved air
traffic control system.
   ``The nation has not yet made a commitment to create an
(aviation) system that can efficiently meet today's demand and
anticipate tomorrow's,'' said Herbert Kelleher, the chairman of
Southwest Airlines, who also is chairman of the new coalition.
   Among the complaints voiced by the coalition were: too few air
traffic controllers are being hired and trained, federal efforts to
modernize the air traffic control technology is way behind
schedule, there are too few airports and the Federal Aviation
Administration needs to be restructured because it is hamstrung by
bureaucratic restrictions.

<HEAD>Defense Asks For March 1989 Trial, Judge Moves to Release Papers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Oliver L. North and three other
Iran-Contra criminal defendants say they won't be ready for trial
until March 1989, after President Reagan leaves office.
   In the first pre-trial hearing in the case, the defense team's
proposed schedule was sharply at odds with that of independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who said he would be prepared for trial
this July.
   The dispute Tuesday left the matter to U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell, who demanded a tight pre-trial schedule, but
warned there may be no case at all unless thousands of government
documents are declassified _ and made available to the defense.
   The nearly four hours of courtroom arguments were devoted
entirely to legal questions that were crucial to the case, but far
removed from the web of covert operations and multimillion-dollar
financial transactions detailed in the 23-count indictment.
   Gone was the drama of the March 24 arraignment, when former
National Security Council staffer North; ex-National Security
Adviser John M. Poindexter; retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord, and his business partner, Albert Hakim, pleaded innocent to
the charges.
   The masterminds of the secret U.S. arms sales to Iran and
assistance to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels during congressional
prohibitions are charged with running those operations as a broad
criminal conspiracy.
   A federal grand jury charged them with defrauding the government
and then trying to cover up their alleged crimes. North, Secord and
Hakim were accused of personally enriching themselves from the
Iran-Contra affair.
   The next step in the case is an April 25 hearing that will give
an indication of whether Walsh's evidence is fully admissible.
   All the defendants except Secord were given congressional
immunity to testify before the Iran-Contra committees last summer.
   The law prohibits Walsh from using the compelled congressional
testimony of North, Poindexter and Hakim as evidence against them.
   Gesell, who said the hearing would not be the final word on
``tainted'' evidence, invited the defense team to present one
witness in an effort to prove its contention that much of Walsh's
evidence is inadmissible.
   Barry Simon, a lawyer for North, accepted the challenge,
commenting, ``We think we can draw blood very quickly'' by
presenting a grand jury witness who would testify he was influenced
by immunized testimony.
   ``Unless I'm satisfied steps were taken (to avoid taint), I'm
not going to try this case,'' Gesell said.
   J. Herbert Stern, a former federal judge who is handling the
question for Walsh, told Gesell the independent counsel would
likely testify at the hearing on the extensive procedures he
undertook to avoid reading or listening to the congressional
testimony.
   In addition to the immunity question, the judge said a major
obstacle to a trial is the stack of 300,000 classified documents
that must be submitted to an inter-agency task force to see if they
can be declassified _ and given to the defense.
   ``We can't try a classified documents case. It will never
work,'' the judge said.
   Walsh estimated that only some 50,000 of the documents were
relevant to the case, but Gesell said the defense team must have
access to all the records, and make its own decisions.
   Gesell raised the question of a July trial date. Walsh said he
could be ready by then, although he said September would be ``more
realistic.''
   Without elaboration, Gesell said he did not want ``the trial
underway when the ballots are being counted'' for the November
presidential election. He also ruled out a trial that would run
into the Christmas vacation, because it would be too great a burden
on jurors, who likely would be sequestered.
   Poindexter lawyer Richard W. Beckler told Gesell, ``I don't
really see a trial actually starting before March of next year.''
   Beckler said numerous defense motions would be filed, including
one to dismiss the case on grounds the defendants were ``carrying
out the foreign policy of the president of the United States. We're
dealing with a political question rather than a question of
criminality,'' Beckler said.
   ``Don't spend a great deal of time on that one,'' Gesell said.
   When the question of pre-trial publicity was raised, Gesell, who
presided at some of the Watergate trials, said that experience
taught him not to worry about the problem because ``a lot of people
don't read or pay any attention to the publicity.''

<HEAD>Farms, Small Town America, Still Feeling Early 80s Bust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The decade of the 1970s was ``the most
prosperous in the history of rural America'' but rural areas now
are losing jobs, population and a significant portion of their tax
bases, says an Agriculture Department economist.
   Unemployment and other economic troubles hit rural areas broadly
in the early 1980s, as small-town businesses and industries as well
as farmers felt the crunch. Ken Deavers of the department's
Economic Research Service says the rural areas still have not fully
recovered.
   ``In terms of rural economic development, you can't use what you
did in the 1970s as a model for what you're going to do in the
1980s,'' he said. ``Therefore, I think that the rural economic
adjustment to the new set of realities, both domestically and
internationally, is going to be very difficult.''
   During the 1970s, the rural South became the nation's
manufacturing center for textiles, apparel, wood products and
shoes. In the West, mining, gas and oil production were thriving.
   There was an unprecedented boom in farming, and rapid growth in
the service sector. Several million people moved from urban areas
to the countryside and small towns.
   But as international markets weakened and as Third World
countries stepped up the competition for low-wage, low-skill jobs,
rural manufacturing suffered. Energy industries slipped into
recession as a world oil glut sent prices downward.
   Deavers offered this profile of rural America in the current
issue of Farmline magazine:
   _The average unemployment rate is more than 9 percent, well
above the national average.
   _People are moving away. In 1986, more than half of all rural
and small-town counties declined in population.
   _The tax base in rural communities is shrinking, which means
that local services such as schools, fire departments, water
systems and police all suffer.
   ``Rural America is not primarily agricultural, and its economic
future is more tightly linked with national and international
developments,'' he said. ``In short, small towns across rural
America are fighting problems of unemployment, inadequate services
and financial stress.''
   Many small towns are working hard to develop self-help,
revitalization strategies, Deavers said. And they are getting
results.
   An agency documentary aired on many public television stations
across the country illustrates some of the local efforts. The
one-hour video, ``Your Hometown,'' shows how several rural
communities have approached economic development. Deavers also is
featured in the program.
   ``Solving their own problems has got to be the basic strategy
that rural communities follow,'' Deavers said. ``Developing
opportunities that provide solutions to the problems has to come
from within, not from outside the community.''
   More information about the video can be obtained from: Dave
Carter, USDA, Room 228-E, 1301 New York Ave. NW, Washington, D.C.

   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng has
announced a five-year plan to improve job opportunities for women
and minorities at the Agriculture Department.
   Lyng said Tuesday the plan sets goals ``to increase the
employment of minorities and women in occupations and (pay) grades
where they are under-represented, compared to the civilian labor
force.''
   The plan, which covers the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1
through 1992, is another step in an initiative Lyng announced two
years ago to begin correcting inequities in USDA employment
practices.
   At that time, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
ranked USDA 52nd in a field of 58 federal agencies in the
employment of minorities.
   Since 1985, total USDA employment has been reduced by nearly
6,500 permanent positions, Lyng said. But the percentage of
minorities in the department's current workforce of 90,000
permanent employees increased to 14.6 percent from 13 percent.
   The number of women at USDA increased to 35 percent from 32.9
percent in 1985, he said.
   ``It has been a long time coming, but the fact that we have
produced this department-wide plan for affirmative employment makes
it clear that the Department of Agriculture is totally committed to
equal opportunity in every facet of its operation,'' Lyng said.
   The plan was prepared by the department's Office of Advocacy and
Enterprise and the Office of Personnel. It establishes specific
hiring and promotion goals for each occupation and minority, based
on an analysis of current USDA employment.
   Further, the plan sets management guidelines and objectives for
minority recruitment, hiring and promotion, employee development
programs, program monitoring and evaluation, preventing sexual
harassment and handling discrimination complaints.
   According to the plan, USDA women ``exceed the government-wide
average in administrative occupations, but trail badly in
professional and technical positions.''
   In the technical jobs, women work primarily at ``indoor
occupations rather than field-going jobs, perpetuating the idea
that women cannot or will not perform outside, strenuous or dirty
work,'' the report said.
   Also, it said, 74 percent of all female employees are currently
in pay grades GS-8 and below, compared with 26 percent of all male
employees in those lower grades.

   A Marine sentry was killed at an
American military facility, and U.S. officials said he apparently
was caught in crossfire between fellow guards on a night search for
intruders.
   A Pentagon spokesman in Washington said the identity of the
intruders was not known, but members of the Panamanian Defense
Forces are thought to have slipped into the facility before.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command in Panama said there
was ``no reason at all at this time to suspect'' that the
Panamanian military was involved in Monday's shooting. He said it
appeared to be an accident.
   The disaster was the second to befall U.S. troops in Panama on
Monday. Earlier, two helicopters collided on a runway at another
base about 50 miles away, injuring eight soldiers.
   The Pentagon spokesman, Dan Howard, said there have been a
series of intrusions at Howard Air Force Base in the past several
weeks by ``individuals who were uniformed and camouflaged.''
   ``When one has intruders into the base perimeter, who are in
uniform and are camouflaged, the assumption that one comes to is
that of course they are'' members of the Panamanian Defense Forces,
Howard said.
   However, Martin Alberto Paz, a spokesman for the Panamanian
military, said the Defense Forces had ``absolutely nothing to do
this'' shooting, and another official accused the United States of
trying to create an incident.
   ``This insinuation tries to implicate the Panama Defense Forces
in an incident in which only United States soldiers participated,''
Maj. Daniel Delgado Diamante told a news conference Tuesday evening.
   And Lt. Cmdr. Doug Schamp, a U.S. Navy spokesman attached to the
Southern Command, said ``we have absolutely no indication'' the
Defense Forces were involved in the shooting.
   The Defense Forces are under the control of Panamanian strongman
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has been indicted by a U.S.
federal court on drug trafficking charges. The Reagan
administration has used diplomatic and economic pressure to try to
drive Noriega from power.
   Pentagon and U.S. Southern Command officials said the Marine
apparently was shot by fellow guards while investigating a break-in
at Howard Air Force Base, on the other side of the Panama Canal
from Panama City.
   The dead man was identified as Cpl. Ricardo M. Villahermosa, 25,
of Santurce, Puerto Rico, a member of I Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th
Marine Regiment of Camp LeJeune, N.C.
   Villahermosa was one of nearly 2,000 Marines and Army personnel
dispatched to Panama in the past few weeks to increase security for
the canal, other U.S. installations and American citizens.
   U.S. Air Force Col. Ron Sconyers of the Southern Command said
Villahermosa was part of a 12-man Marine patrol at the Arriajan
Tank Farm, a fuel storage area near the air base.
   He said the Marine suffered massive internal bleeding from a
single bullet.
   The Southern Command and the Pentagon issued identical
statements saying the shooting ``occurred after an apparent
intrusion by six or eight individuals'' into the tank farm area.
   ``U.S. security forces patrolling the area had split up and were
in the process of rejoining when a trip flare was set off, sounding
like gunfire,'' the statement said.
   ``In response, the two elements of the patrol fired. Seven
rounds were discharged before the on-the-scene commander ordered a
cease-fire. Initial indications are that the fatal gunshot wound
was not the result of hostile gunfire, but rather the result of a
crossfire from the U.S. shots fired.''
   In the helicopter accident, eight soldiers were injured slightly
when two UH-60 helicopters collided at Fort Sherman, about 50 miles
north of the capital. They were not immediately identified.
   The Southern Command said they were permanently assigned to Fort
Kobbe near Panama City, one of 10 U.S. military installations along
the canal.

   A teen-age gang member has been arrested in
connection with a drive-by street shooting that left one dead and
11 injured and prompted an intensive police crackdown on
drug-dealing gangs.
   ``He was very belligerent and portrayed himself ... as a real
bad guy, until he was informed that he was being arrested and
booked for murder, whereupon he broke down and cried like the big
coward that he really is,'' police Chief Daryl Gates said.
   Also Tuesday, five members of the crime-fighting Guardian
Angels, including the group's founder, Curtis Sliwa, were arrested
while protesting Friday's scheduled release of the gang movie
``Colors.''
   The teen-ager arrested in the drive-by shooting was a known gang
member, police said. He was not identified because of he is a minor.
   A 19-year-old man was killed and 11 others, including a child,
were wounded in the April 1 shooting in south-central Los Angeles.
Police are seeking two others in the case.
   City Council has approved spending $4.5 million for police
overtime by a 1,000-officer anti-gang task force that has so far
made made 1,453 arrests, including 794 gang members.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner said the crackdown has disrupted
gang activity and heightened public awareness. The district
attorney's office has filed charges in 59 of 118 cases resulting
from the street arrests.
   Those cases rejected were dismissed for insufficient evidence,
said Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay, as were half of 41 cases
sent to the city attorney's office.
   Despite the citywide gang crackdown, four people were killed in
drive-by shootings last weekend, and nine were wounded in a similar
attack in suburban Willowbrook, authorities said.
   Police said the five Guardian Angels arrested Tuesday were
trying to force their way into the offices of Orion Pictures, which
produced ``Colors,'' a movie that anti-gang groups contend
glorifies gang violence.
   Sliwa and the four others were booked for battery after
scuffling with security guards and were held on $500 bail each,
said police Sgt. B.P. Kelepecz.
   Reiner, however, came out in support of ``Colors,'' saying it
may spur public support for the war on gangs. ``This is not `West
Side Story' revisited,'' Reiner said. ``These are not darlings who
are going to dance their way into your heart. These are sociopathic
killers.
   ``It's not the old days of switchblades and tire irons,'' he
said. ``You're dealing with Uzi machine guns and MAC 10s and mean
streets, very mean streets.''
   Police say there were 387 gang-related murders in Los Angeles
County last year and more than 85 such homicides have been reported
so far this year.

<HEAD>Task Force Calls On Congress to Oversee Children's Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress bears a responsibility to see that
children dependent on high technology machines to stay alive
receive the care they need at home when possible, says a federal
task force.
   The report issued Tuesday makes no estimate of what such an
approach would cost and acknowledges that bringing about the
resolution it recommends will depend on generating public pressure
for changes.
   ``Advocates must give special emphasis to raising public
awareness of these children and the special issues affecting their
care,'' said the report by the Task Force on Technology Dependent
Children.
   Rep. Thomas J. Tauke, R-Iowa, who was among those pushing for
creation of the task force 18 months ago, acknowledged to the head
of the panel at a news conference that ``you have thrown a good
portion of the challenge back to Congress.''
   ``I will try to make sure these recommendations do not die on
the vine,'' Tauke said at a news conference. ``This report is going
to put additional pressure on Congress to respond to the need.''
   At the same time, Tauke said there is little likelihood of
action this year with Congress aiming for adjournment in advance of
the November elections.
   The task force said Congress should:
   _``Develop and implement legislative strategies for ensuring
access to programs that meet the individual needs of
technology-dependent children.
   _``Develop legislative strategies requiring all public and
private payers that finance health care for technology-dependent
children ... to develop appropriate measures for ending
institutional bias within these programs.''
   Creation of the task force stemmed partly from the Katie Beckett
case in 1981. Medicaid rules in effect at the time kept her from
being cared for at home at a cost of about $2,000 a month, but it
was costing about $12,000 a month to keep her in a hospital.
   When the case came to President Reagan's attention, he told
aides in a widely publicized episode to find a way to cut through
the red tape.
   Tauke said Katie, now 10, lives at home, attends school and
sings in her church choir.
   ``For every Katie thriving at home, we still have many children
in hospital wards,'' Tauke added.
   Administrative changes made since 1981 allow states more leeway
in deciding how to spend Medicaid dollars on such children who are
dependent on machines to help them breathe, as Katie was, or
maintain other life sustaining functions.
   Estimates of the number of children who require such care range
from 2,300 to 17,000, depending on the level of technology needed,
but the report says fewer than 400 are being cared for at home
under the Medicaid waivers now allowed.
   The task force defined a technology-dependent child as one
requiring use of a specific medical device to compensate for loss
of a life-sustaining function and one who ``requires daily, ongoing
care or monitoring by trained personnel.''
   ``We're not talking about hearing aides or crutches,'' said Dr.
Robert G. Kettrick, the task force chairman who emphasized that
drawing such a specific definition for the first time was in itself
a significant step.
   Also for the first time, it defines ``appropriate care'' as
whatever is required to ``maintain life support'' and ``provide an
environment conducive to growth and development.'' It spells out
that such a treatment plan is to be ``documented and managed
through the use of an individualized plan developed and monitored
by a team which includes parents or guardians.''

<HEAD>Bush Says Democrats Would Bring Back Carter Malaise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush says he hopes
indicted former White House aides John Poindexter and Oliver North
are found innocent in the Iran-Contra affair but will keep his own
counsel on the subject of a pardon if they're not.
   Bush also conceded ``I've taken a lot of shots'' from Democrats
for refusing to reveal private advice he had given President Reagan
on the subject of arms sales to Iran.
   ``But it doesn't bother me, because I'm doing what's right,'' he
said Tuesday.
   The vice president was asked whether he would pardon Poindexter
and North if elected.
   ``I hope, my own personal hope is, they're found innocent of any
wrongdoing,'' Bush said.
   All but assured of the Republican presidential nomination, Bush
campaigned in New York saying he doesn't see much difference among
the three Democratic contenders.
   Bush called the Democratic contest, heating up here in advance
of the crucial New York primary next Tuesday, a ``bloodletting.''
He accused all three Democrats of seeking to ``set the clock back
to the malaise days'' that he said marked former President Jimmy
Carter's term.
   Bush planned to visit a public school in East Harlem today
before campaign stops in Buffalo and Rochester.
   At the school stop, Bush was expected to stress a favorite
campaign theme - a greater emphasis on education.
   He was also making a bid for minority votes. Asked on Tuesday if
Jesse Jackson's candidacy would make it difficult for Republicans
to attract black votes, Bush conceded it probably would, telling
reporters in Syracuse, ``There's sort of a race pride there that I
understand.''
   But, he added, ``I think my message of hope and opportunity,
more employment, a better shot through education, offers more hope
than some of those age-old Democratic answers that have failed.''
   Bush threw out the first ball at a Mets game at Shea Stadium on
Tuesday, then attended a $1,000-a-plate evening fund-raiser
sponsored by New York developer Donald Trump.
   Even though he has a lock on the GOP nomination, Bush has
indicated he plans to campaign throughout the remaining primary
season _ particularly in vote-rich states like New York.
   ``We've got to get into these states and command a presence,''
said Bush aide Peter Teeley.
   Bush, in a session with New York broadcast reporters, said any
discussion of pardoning Poindexter and North was ``too
hypothetical. A pardon imputes guilt. And the American system after
all is innocent-until-proven-guilty.''
   ``I'm not going to get into that,'' he added. ``If I had to face
that at some time, then I'll keep my own counsel and make my own
decision.''
   Bush also said he strongly opposes creation of a Palestinian
state _ a subject that has become a major issue on the Democratic
side.
   Jesse Jackson has said he favors a Palestinian homeland.
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. has also accused Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis of harboring similar sympathies, which Dukakis
denies.
   ``There shouldn't be a Palestinian state,'' Bush said. ``It's
not good foreign policy. Solving the Palestinian problem is.''
   On another subject, Bush told reporters that he did not think he
was too aristoratic to build wide support.
   ``If so, why would I have cleaned them (Republican rivals) up in
the primaries?'' he asked.
   ``For you to suggest that some aristocratic bias makes it
impossible for me to reach out - just you watch,'' Bush declared.

<HEAD>Off-Duty Correction Officer With Gun Whisked Out Of Jackson Rally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An off-duty city correction officer was whisked
out of a rally for Jesse Jackson in the Bronx on Tuesday night
after Secret Service agents noticed that he was carrying a gun,
police said.
   According to police, Capt. Henry Mack, assigned to the Manhattan
House of Detention, was attempting to take a photograph of the
candidate when the agents observed the gun in his waistband.
   ``As far as we know, he hasn't done anything wrong,'' Sgt.
Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman, said of Mack, who was not
charged with anything.
   Ruby Ryles, spokeswoman for the city's Correction Department,
said: ``He has peace officer status. That enables him to carry a
weapon legally.''
   O'Donnell said the incident happened at 9:50 p.m. at a rally for
the Democratic presidential candidate. Secret Service agents saw
the .32-caliber semi-automatic and took Mack out of the room, he
said.
   Barry Thumma, an Associated Press photographer who was covering
Jackson, said agents encircled Jackson and escorted him off the
stage in the opposite direction.
   Thumma said Jackson left the stage for a few minutes and then
returned and continued giving his speech, without explanation to
the audience.
   A dispatcher at the Secret Service office in New York, who
declined to give his name, said no one would be available to
comment until Wednesday morning.

<HEAD>Swedish School Appeals For Arab Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban school, apparently
disillusioned with the Swedish welfare system, has asked a wealthy
Arab sheikhdom to finance improvements, Sweden's national news
agency TT reported.
   The parents' organization of the Hjulsta comprehensive school
wrote a letter for publication in the Daily News in Abu Dhabi,
capital of the United Arab Emirates, that made the appeal and
detailed poor conditions at the school.
   It is located in an area with a high concentration of immigrants
and has pupils speaking 33 languages. Under Sweden's welfare
system, all schools are free but generally lack facilities to deal
with exceptional problems.
   ``It's a wonderful idea and I hope (Swedish) politicians are
really ashamed of themselves,'' said Harriet Martin who initiated
the appeal. ``I'm positive they (the Arabs) will help us,'' she
told Swedish Radio.
   TT, illustrating the problems, said on Tuesday that one
geography textbook used in the school was older than the United
Arab Emirates, created in 1971.

   More companies are lining up behind
environmental groups by promising to stop using a chemical compound
that threatens the Earth's ozone layer.
   The latest move away from chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, compounds
comes from the 15 or so companies who use them to make plastic foam
food packages, things like egg cartons.
   They'll be using substitute compounds by the end of the year,
their trade association, the Foodservice & Packaging Institute,
announced Tuesday. That will make it the first industry to give up
CFCs completely.
   Consumers should notice little change, since foam packages will
still be on the shelves.
   The announcement came after consultations with three major
environmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the
Environmental Defense Fund and Friends of the Earth. Friends of the
Earth already had persuaded some fast-food chains to stop using
CFC-made foam clamshell hamburger warmers, and some cities have
banned these products.
   All three praised the industry and were joined by the
Environmental Protection Agency. EPA chief Lee M. Thomas said in a
statement the action was ``A welcome contribution to the protection
of the earth's ozone layer.''
   CFC's break down the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from
the Sun's ultra-violet rays.
   The institute's announcement was the third in Washington since
December on ending commercial use of CFC compounds.
   In December, the AT&T Corp. said it was switching its solvents
for cleaning computer chips from one of the CFCs.
   Last month, the Du Pont Co., the largest producer of CFCs, said
it would work toward a total phaseout of CFC manufacture, but set
no deadline.
   The institute's program, said Joseph Goffman, attorney for the
Environmental Defense Fund, ``surpasses in three important respects
the phaseout program announced by Du Pont.'' It has a deadline,
provides for public reporting by the institute on CFC use and
establishes a cooperative program with the environmental groups to
encourage the search for an entirely benign substitute, he said.
   About a third of current foam packaging for food is made with
CFCs, and most of that is expected to be switched to a related
compound called HCFC-22, approved last December by the Food and
Drug Administration. The institute committed itself to switch to a
benign compound, if it can be developed, within a year of approval
by the FDA.
   HCFC-22 still has some potential to destroy the high-altitude
ozone layer, but EPA estimates it is only about 5 percent as
powerful as the compounds being given up.
   The compounds used as blowing agents in making food packaging
foams account for 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the United States'
total CFC use, and Geoffrey Webb of Friends of the Earth conceded,
``Clearly this is not the bulk of ozone depletion.'''
   But Webb said, ``it's clearly an unnecessary use,'' and the
symbolism of the switch is important to the environmentalists.
   David Doniger, attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said, ``It is our intention to go to other sectors (of the
economy) and say, `These guys did it; so can you.'''
   The CFCs used in blowing agents are gasses that escape to the
atmosphere and rise over a decade to the ozone layer 15 miles to 25
miles high.
   EPA figures each percent decline in the ozone layer means an
increase in of 4.8 percent to 7.5 percent in the most common skin
cancer. For this and other reasons, major nations agreed last year
to cut CFC production by 50 percent by 1998.

   The woman who was raped and mutilated
by Lawrence Singleton says his impending release and reports that
he is seeking court action against her have prompted her to renew
her court battle with him.
   Mary Vincent, left for dead after Singleton raped her and hacked
off her forearms, said Tuesday she has instructed her lawyer to
serve Singleton with a $2.4 million judgment she won against him
last year in Nevada.
   ``Before today's news ... I was almost ready to live and let
live, and go on with my life. That is no longer possible,'' Vincent
said Tuesday.
   Singleton was convicted of the rape-mutilation in 1978 and was
sentenced to a 14-year, four-month term. He is due for release from
San Quentin state prison on May 25.
   Vincent's statement, read by a spokesman for her lawyer, came
after a newspaper reported Monday that Singleton was seeking an
investigation into his claim that she kidnapped him at knifepoint
while hitchhiking.
   Singleton was paroled last year for good behavior and work
credits, but for the past 10 months has been living in a mobile
home on the San Quentin prison grounds after residents of several
Northern California communities fought plans to place him in their
towns.
   Singleton, who maintained that other hitchhikers were
responsible for the attack on Vincent, also told the Daily Ledger
of Antioch that he may spend his first days of freedom with a
church group in Oregon.
   Vincent, whose attorney says only that she resides in the
Pacific Northwest, was reported last year to be living in southern
Oregon.
   The pastor of a church in Azalea, Ore., said Tuesday that
Singleton would be welcome to live with church members after he
regains his freedom.
   ``We'd be liars if we denied him a home now,'' Tom Smith Jr.
told The News-Review of Roseburg, Ore. ``He would have to agree to
living our lifestyle, which is caring more for your brother than
yourself, and not everybody is willing to do that.''
   Smith said he hasn't been in touch with Singleton, though he had
tried to reach him through the parole division in California.
   When Singleton was due to be paroled, Smith offered him a job as
a handyman with the Bride of Christ Church, but Oregon officials
denied permission for Singleton to move to the state.

<HEAD>Pressure Rises on Borrowing Governments to Change Policies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Finance Ministers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly one dollar in every four the World Bank
lends to Third World governments is given on condition that they
change their policies, following the urging of the United States.
   It's not a new kind of lending, but the report released this
week reflects the importance the United States and other wealthy
countries now give to influencing governments of poorer nations.
   In 1979 the proportion of this kind of loan was less than one
dollar in $300. The rest of the bank's money was used, as now, for
the traditional kinds of World Bank loans: building schools, roads
and hospitals, dredging harbors and helping farmers, without regard
to how the government is run.
   The bank _ the biggest source of aid for poor countries _
authorized more than $17.5 billion in loans in the year that ended
last June 30, compared with $10 billion in 1979. In 1979
policy-based lending amounted to only $31 million compared with
almost $3.5 billion in 1987.
   The new proportions appeared in a special report issued as part
of this week's semi-annual meetings of the bank and its sister
organization, the International Monetary Fund. They are owned by
the same 151 countries, with the United States as the largest
single contributor to both.
   At a 1985 meeting in Seoul, South Korea, Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III said the bank should take the lead in
policy-based lending. The bank had already been making such loans
on a smaller scale, but Baker's speech and the advent of a new bank
president _ Barber Conable _ gave the process a push.
   It's called ``conditionality'' and the International Monetary
Fund has been using it on almost all loans for years. The IMF,
however, does not claim to be a development agency; its job is to
keep currencies stable, and it rarely lends money for more than
three years.
   The bank's mission is to raise living standards over the long
term and it has lent for periods as long as 50 years.
   Baker's idea was for the bank to help work out long-term plans _
country by country _ that would ``adjust'' a government's policies
and put the country in better position to handle its debts. Since
then, Third World debt has risen from $738 billion to more than
$1.1 trillion, the bank estimates.
   The bank's report measures the success of its adjustment
programs by a country's growth, although it says there is no simple
cause and effect and the effects can take a long time in coming.
   It surveyed 16 countries which had such programs between 1980
and 1984, before Baker made his proposal. It said eight of them
increased the average citizen's income: South Korea, Pakistan,
Turkey, Thailand, Costa Rica, Ghana, Mauritius and Morocco. Only in
the Philippines and the Ivory Coast were there declines.
   ``These programs have already produced solid achievements,'' the
report says.
   ``Further success will depend not only on the continued
willingness of borrowers to undertake difficult adjustment but on
sufficient external finance.''
   That was a reference to the bank's effort to get a big increase
in its capital so that it can increase its lending. Member
governments, including the Reagan administration, have approved the
increase but there have been threats of trouble in Congress because
the United States is still behind with its payments on an earlier
capital increase.

<HEAD>Convict Is Sprung With Help Of Retired Cop</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who spent six years behind bars
for a robbery he didn't commit credits his release from prison to
the determination of a retired policeman who dug up the evidence
proving his innocence.
   ``He knew I wasn't guilty. He knew I didn't do it,'' Charles
Blake said Tuesday of the man who came to his aid, Robert Seymour.
``I just got caught in the system and it took me along.''
   Blake, 43, was freed last week from state prison after Norfolk
Superior Court Judge John D. Sheehan listened to a tape recording
of another convict confessing to the armed robbery Blake was first
jailed for in 1971.
   Blake was returned to prison in 1985 after being at large for 11
years following an escape.
   The judge reduced the one- to five-year sentence he had given
Blake for his escape, saying he had served enough time. The
sentence was the only one remaining, since another judge reduced
Blake's original 10- to 15-year robbery sentence last fall after
hearing similar evidence.
   ``I tell you, those court officers would have yelled `Yea!' if
they were allowed to,'' said Blake's cousin, Yvonne Barklow.
   Among Blake's supporters hugging and shaking hands in the
courtroom was his former wife, Delores, who had returned from
California with their two children last May to work on his defense.
They plan to remarry next month.
   But the focus of attention was Seymour, a 20-year veteran of the
Springfield police force.
   ``I've never had a case in which a police officer has gone to
such lengths to try to show a man was unfairly convicted,''
Thompson said.
   The self-effacing Seymour said only: ``That kid spent a lot of
time in jail for something he didn't do. I feel rotten about it.''
   Blake said he will treat Seymour to dinner as soon as the former
policeman has a free night from his part-time job as a security
officer at Holyoke Community College. ``He was the main ingredient
in this,'' Blake said.
   Seymour said an informant called him the night of Blake's
conviction to tell him the government had the wrong man. Blake had
been found guilty of one of two armed robberies in the Springfield
area, both committed by a man wearing a full Afro hair style.
   The following year, James D. Kelly was convicted of the other
armed robbery and given a 12- to 18-year sentence.
   Seymour, then a sergeant conducting drug investigations,
believed Blake might have been mistaken for Kelly because of his
Afro. Although he was not assigned to the case, Seymour went to the
prosecutor with surveillance photos and mug shots showing the
similarities between the men. The prosecutor said he saw no
resemblance.
   Blake escaped while on furlough in 1974 and worked as a roofer
for the next 11 years until his arrest in Washington, D.C.
   Seymour, meanwhile, kept in touch with Blake's family through
the Episcopal church they both attended, and often visited them to
keep their spirits up.
   ``All the support I had was Robert Seymour,'' said Blake's
cousin, Ms. Barklow.
   In 1986, two years after his retirement, Seymour visited Kelly
in jail. Kelly confessed the robbery in writing and on tape,
Seymour said, although he later refused to testify at any hearings.
   Blake says he's planning to move to California, resume work as a
roofer and try to put the years in jail behind him.
   ``I'm just glad to be free,'' he said. ``Maybe I might be
resentful later on.''

   U.S. Rep. Beau Boulter easily defeated
millionaire Houston businessman Wes Gilbreath in Tuesday's
Republican runoff for the nomination to run against Democratic U.S.
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen in November.
   Final tallies of the 4,229 precincts showed Boulter with 60.1
percent to Gilbreath's 39.9 percent.
   Gilbreath's campaign director, David Davidson, said Gilbreath
was a victim of low voter turnout, especially in Houston.
   In Washington, Bentsen issued a statement congratulating
Boulter. ``The real race starts now that each party has chosen its
nominee. I expect a hard-fought campaign,'' Bentsen said.
   GOP voters in Tuesday's Texas runoffs also decided a runoff race
in one congressional district.
   In the 13th District, in the Panhandle, political newcomer Larry
Milner defeated Bob Price, who held the seat 20 years ago, to
challenge Democratic state Sen. Bill Sarpalius in November to
replace Boulter.
   Democrats settled all their statewide races in the March 8
primary, but had contests in two congressional districts.
   In one of the Democratic congressional runoffs, attorney Wayne
Walker led teacher Richard Konrad by one-half of one percent to
face incumbent Rep. Tom DeLay of the 22nd District, a Houston
suburb.
   In the 6th District, contractor N.P. ``Pat'' Kendrick of Joshua
in central Texas defeated farmer John E. Welch of Waxahachie, with
the winner facing Republican incumbent Rep. Joe Barton.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, crushed a
political unknown in the March 8 Democratic primary.
   Gilbreath, 59, was the top vote-getter in the GOP primary,
picking up 36.6 percent of the vote in the four-man race. Boulter,
46, was second with 30.5 percent.
   The two men agreed on most major issues, opposing abortion,
urging curbs on government spending and favoring a traditional
conservative approach to governing.
   Boulter's campaign depended on endorsements from Texas
Republican officials, including a majority of the members of the
State Republican Executive Committee and the third- and
fourth-place finishers in the March primary. He picked up the
backing of the major anti-abortion groups.
   Boulter, a two-term congressman from Amarillo, spent about
$250,000 on the campaign. Gilbreath spent over $1 million, almost
all of it out of his own pockets.
   ``It takes money to run a media campaign, and that is the only
way you are going to beat Lloyd Bentsen in the state of Texas,''
Gilbreath said.

   Algerian authorities opened negotiations
early Wednesday with Shiite Moslem hijackers less than two hours
after their comandeered Kuwaiti jumbo jet with about 40 people
aboard landed on a flight from Cyprus, the official news agency
reported.
   Algerian Interior Minister Hedi Khediri was seen going in a
convoy of three cars to the plane, which was isolated on the tarmac
of Houari Boumedienne airport with spotlights trained on it. The
convoy returned 10 minutes later.
   There were reports Khediri was accompanied by Transport Minister
Rachid Benyelles and the head of state security, Abdelmadjid
Bouzbid.
   The APS news agency said negotiations started at 4:50 a.m.
(11:50 p.m. EDT Tuesday). Algerian government sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, specified that negotiations were direct,
not by radio.
   Activity continued around the Kuwait Airways aircraft, but
nothing could be clearly distinguished from a distance. Reporters
were being kept in the terminal area 400 yards from the aircraft.
   The Boeing 747 left Larnaca, Cyprus, after the gunmen freed 12
more passengers in what they called a gesture of goodwill. The
hijackers have killed two passengers during the grim nine-day
odyssey.
   The plane landed in Algiers at 3:07 a.m. (10:07 p.m. EDT
Tuesday). Hours later, its red navigation lights continued to blink.
   The Algerian sources said rooms were readied at the Aurassi
Hotel, overlooking the city center, in the event they were needed
to take in hostages.
   Earlier in Cyprus, Akis Fantis, a government spokesman, told
reporters ``sources in Algiers'' gave assurances that the gunmen
would give up the hostages and the plane in Algeria, but one of the
hijackers denied it.
   The hijacker said by radio just before takeoff: ``We deny what
has been reported by radios and by the media that we are ready to
hand the plane to anyone. We refuse to do that, until martyrdom.''
He did not mention hostages.
   On Tuesday in Larnaca, the gunmen said they had donned death
shrouds and had renamed the jetliner ``the plane of martyrdom.''
   About 40 people, including the six to eight hijackers, remained
aboard the Kuwait Airways jet. It was commandeered April 5 on a
flight from Bangkok to Kuwait and spent three days at Mashhad,
Iran. It was subsequently allowed to land at Larnaca because it was
low on fuel.
   One of those freed in Cyprus said three members of Kuwait's
ruling family, Fadel Khaled al-Sabah and his sisters, Anware and
Ebtesam, still were on the plane, according to Dr. George Olympios
at Larnaca General Hospital, where the freed hostages were taken.
   ``No one is in a grave condition,'' Olympios said of the
released hostages. ``Most are in good health but are staying for
observation; nothing serious apart from fatigue.''
   Twelve passengers walked off the aircraft at 10:25 p.m. Tuesday
(3:25 p.m. EDT) in Cyprus and got into three ambulances as the
flashing lights from the plane and emergency vehicles illuminated
the runway.
   The hijackers have demanded that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranian
terrorists, all but one of them Shiites, convicted and imprisoned
for a chain of bombings there in December 1983. Kuwait refuses.
   Inside the plane on Tuesday in Cyprus, the captive passengers
sweltered through the day under the Mediterranean sun. Some of the
passengers, who have reportedly been beaten, were nervous and
disoriented as the hijackers forced them to talk to the Larnaca
control tower.
   Fadel Khaled al-Sabah, a businessman and cousin of Kuwait's
emir, Shieik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, could barely speak when the
hijackers put him on the radio to plead for fuel.
   ``We depend on God for our fate,'' he said in a strained voice.

<HEAD>Trade Officials, Senators Open Bargaining on Veto-Proof Trade Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan administration officials are bargaining
with lawmakers over what kind of trade bill the president would be
willing to sign, but neither side appeared to be yielding ground.
   ``We had a good healthy discussion,'' U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton K. Yeutter said Tuesday after a 30-minute session with
three key senators that the participants acknowledged was
inconclusive.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, merely
said the meeting ``confirmed some of the things that I had
thought,'' but indicated he had not gone into the session expecting
a quick deal.
   Also on hand for the session in Bentsen's office were Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III and Sens. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and
John C. Danforth, R-Mo. The idea was to find out what items must be
dropped from the 1,000-page trade bill moving in Congress to
guarantee that President Reagan would sign rather than veto it.
   Confusion surrounds the bill because most of it has been
approved under a complex system set up by a conference committee to
resolve differences between House and Senate versions. Farm
lawmakers have been unable to finish their work and another panel
has yet to act on provisions requiring disclosure of foreign
holdings in this country.
   The Reagan administration opposes some of the provisions that
did get approval.
   One is a requirement that major employers give notice of plant
closings and large-scale layoffs. Another is trade sanctions
against Japan's Toshiba Corp. for the sale to the Soviet Union of
equipment that lets submarines run quietly.
   Lawmakers say they think Reagan would sign the central
provisions of the measure that streamline machinery for retaliation
against trade violations, including transfer of authority to order
such action from the president to the U.S. trade representative.
   But the possibility remains that lawmakers, who had tried to
have a final product before their spring break last week, will
decide to go back to the drawing board for one last effort to get
the measure into shape.
   Hours before the meeting, House Speaker Jim Wright warned
lawmakers against watering down the bill by dropping its most
stringent provisions in an effort to prevent a presidential veto.
   ``It is not really prudent for the White House to try to get the
last pound of flesh,'' Wright told reporters.
   Wright said the administration's ``persistent opposition to
several elements of the trade bill creates doubt as to whether it
really understands even yet the seriousness of America's
competitiveness problems.''
   ``What does the White House really want?'' Wright said. ``Surely
it shouldn't want to lobotomize the trade bill as the price for the
president's signature. Its spokesmen seem repelled by those
provisions which are bold enough, creative enough and potent enough
to deal with our persistent and growing superdeficit in trade, so
inappropriate for a superpower.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday there had
been ``notable progress on the trade bill'' but ``improvements must
be made.''
   ``The administration is prepared to continue working with the
congressional leaders and the full conference on an acceptable
bill,'' Fitzwater's statement said.
   ``But let there be no misunderstanding _ the president will not
hestitate to veto a trade bill that will hurt America's economic
prosperity,'' it added.

   Senators debating the $1.1 trillion federal
budget for fiscal 1989, with few disputes over its details, are
questioning whether the spending plan accurately portrays the
government's deficit.
   The lawmakers hoped to complete work today on a budget blueprint
in which the key questions about taxes and domestic, defense and
foreign assistance spending have already been settled.
   During Tuesday's second day of debate over the proposal, some
senators examined its projected $136 billion deficit and pronounced
the budget misleading.
   The $136 billion figure is crucial because that is the 1989
deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. Should
the deficit exceed that figure by $10 billion, spending would
automatically be cut across the board to the target level.
   The problem, said legislators, was that the figure includes
surpluses being stashed away by several government programs, such
as Social Security, in which money is set aside for specific
purposes.
   The legislators argued that since those funds can be spent for
nothing else, it is deceptive to use them to reduce the
government's red ink.
   ``There is nothing less to call this but fraud,'' said Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.
   In an 85-8 vote Tuesday, the Senate gave preliminary approval to
a non-binding amendment urging lawmakers to discount the special
highway and aviation funds when determining the size of the
deficit. Those programs are expected to garner a $2 billion surplus
in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the budget committee,
has introduced another provision aimed at persuading senators not
to count Social Security when computing the deficit.
   Social Security, which is accumulating money for the retirement
of the Baby Boom generation in the early 21st Century, is expected
to run a $46 billion surplus next year.
   The budget itself contains little that is controversial, largely
because last fall's summit agreement between President Reagan and
congressional leaders answered most of the questions that have
sparked months of bitter debate in the past.
   As a result, Congress' work on the budget resolution is expected
to be completed earlier than it has in years.
   The Senate's spending plan calls for $294 billion in military
spending, $16.1 billion for foreign assistance and $169.2 billion
for domestic programs set by automatic formulas.
   It also includes $14 billion in new taxes called for by the
summit agreement and already enacted.
   The major differences between the Senate proposal and the
version Reagan sent Congress in February are over domestic
priorities. The lawmakers would provide money for several
development and transportation programs that the president sought
to eliminate or slash severely.
   The senators would increase space and science spending by about
one-fourth, and also dramatically increase money for AIDS research,
education and drug enforcement.
   Their budget would also increase military salaries by 4.3
percent and pay for civilian workers by 2 percent; spend $500
million for more farm commodities for the poor; permit expansion of
the Medicaid health program and enactment of Medicare catastrophic
illness insurance; and cut rural housing assistance, elderly
housing and community and regional development.
   The House approved a similar version of the budget last month.
   Congress' two chambers must ultimately approve identical budget
resolutions, but the president's signature is not required.

<HEAD>Sonny Bono Elected Mayor Of Palm Springs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf, `A heavy ...' to UPDATE with Clint
Eastwood-backed candidate winner in Carmel.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sonny Bono, the singer turned
restaurateur who rose to fame singing ``I've Got You Babe'' to
ex-wife Cher, was elected mayor of this desert resort Tuesday.
   The successful candidate walked into a crowd of 1,000
well-wishers at the posh Maxim's Suite Hotel as the band played the
theme from the movie ``Rocky.''
   Putting his hand in the air, Bono said, ``Wow! I can't believe
it. The city goes back to the people. They made us too mad, gave us
one too many kicks and that's the last we're going to take.
   ``It's a wonderful American thing that just happened,'' he said.
   ``We think it's great,'' said Jack Price, assistant manager at
Bono's namesake restaurant, where the champagne bottles were
popping. ``We were behind him all the way.''
   Bono easily won the seven-way race with 4,842 votes, while
accountant Lloyd Maryanov was second with 2,498, city spokeswoman
Julie Baumer said. Businesswoman Deyna Hodges had 1,934 votes and
Vice Mayor Eli Birer, 1,140. Three other active candidates trailed
far behind.
   ``This has just been a very active election. When you get that
many people running there's a lot of interest,'' said Patty Bode,
assistant city clerk, who estimated turnout at 55 percent.
   A heavy turnout also was expected in seaside Carmel, in Northern
California, even though actor Clint Eastwood was not running for a
second term as mayor because, he said, he was more concerned with
bringing up his two teen-age children. Parking and traffic were the
major issues in a six-way race won by Jean Grace, who was endorsed
by the 57-year-old Eastwood.
   Palm Springs officials said their 55 percent turnout, while
higher than the average 30 percent to 40 percent, would not be a
record.
   There are about 18,000 registered voters in this city of 38,000,
and usually 6,000 turn out on election day, said Mayor Frank
Bogert, 76, who is retiring after serving two two-year terms.
   Bono, 53, rose to fame as the furry-vested, bell-bottomed former
hippie singing ``I've Got You Babe'' with Cher, who he correctly
had predicted would win the Best Actress Oscar on Monday.
   The new mayor will serve four years instead of two and be paid
$15,000 a year.
   Most of the candidates are promising to revitalize Palm Springs,
which has lost much of its glamour and tourist business to such
neighboring desert communities as Palm Desert, where Jim and Tammy
Bakker are living, and Rancho Mirage, where Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra
and Gerald Ford live.
   Bono has been at the forefront of the revitalization movement,
planning a celebrity-filled film festival, concerts, and a sporting
event such as a marathon or triathalon to attract tourists and
money if he is elected.
   Bono has said he began coming to Palm Springs, 110 miles east of
Los Angeles, 14 years ago to escape the big-city craziness of Los
Angeles. He moved here four years ago and opened an Italian
restaurant, called Bono.
   After run-ins with city officials over the size of his
restaurant sign and a retaining wall at the 1920s estate he is
refurbishing, he decided to run for mayor.
   ``If they can do that to me, just imagine how the ordinary
person is treated who wants to start a business,'' he said last
week, referring to unnamed city officials. ``We're trying to
encourage business here, not chase it away. I have a big investment
in this city. I don't want to see it deteriorate or decline.''
   Bono still dabbles in entertainment, appearing with Cher during
a reunion on ``Late Night With David Letterman'' recently and
co-starring in the film ``Hairspray.''
   Bono and his fourth wife, Mary, 26, are expecting the couple's
first child this month.

<HEAD>Trustees Revoke Curran's Authority To Teach In Name Of Vatican</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Charles Curran says his battle with
Catholic University may be nearly resolved even though the
university's board of trustees stripped him of his authority to
teach theology in the name of the Vatican.
   Although they revoked the suspended theologian's ``canonical
mission,'' the trustees Tuesday allowed him to remain as a tenured
professor and conceded Curran can teach at the university in
programs other than those requiring Vatican sanction.
   ``This action does not remove Father Curran's tenure with the
university,'' the university said in a statement. ``It does bar him
from teaching in the university's Department of Theology.''
   Curran has dissented from church doctrine on a range of sexual
issues, expressing the view that contraception and sterilization
``are not intrinsically evil'' and that the church should allow
divorce ``in certain circumstances.'' He also said that for a
``genuine homosexual, homosexual acts in the context of a loving
relationship striving for permanency can in a certain sense be
objectively and morally acceptable.''
   The trustees directed top board members to talk with Curran
about ``an alternative teaching assignment within an area of his
professional competence.''
   That would leave him able to teach at Catholic, but outside of
the Department of Theology where the internationally known
theologian has taught for 22 years.
   The action sets up a possible end to a controversy that has
pitted the conservative church hierarchy against liberal Catholics
in the United States.
   It comes a week after a judge rejected the university's request
to dismiss a suit by Curran seeking his reinstatement.
   Curran has claimed in the lawsuit that he should be allowed to
teach classes that do not require the canonical mission, a form of
license to teach programs accredited by the Vatican.
   ``The board's action appears to acknowledge that such a
resolution may now be acceptable,'' Curran said in a statement
released Tuesday by his lawyers.
   ``If that proves to be correct, then we should be able to move
quickly to put this matter behind us and get on with our work,'' he
said.
   Curran's attorney, John Hunt, said Curran would only accept a
teaching assignment that is ``for real. His area of competence is
moral theology.''
   Curran has been suspended from teaching at Catholic since
January 1987, when Washington, D.C., Archbishop James A. Hickey,
chancellor of the school, acted on a Vatican ruling that Curran's
views on sexual issues left him ``neither suitable nor eligible to
teach Catholic theology.''
   Curran is now a visiting professor at Cornell University.

   A few local IRS officials were fully
``de-dunked-able'' this week for grinning taxpayers eagerly
spending their adjusted gross income for the chance to sink a tax
collector in a 4-foot-deep ducking booth.
   At $2 for three shots, it was an experience not to be
depreciated.
   The windup. ... The pitch. Whoosh. Whap! Splash!
   And IRS data processing manager Rick Denzio went into the drink.
(See paragraph 8.)
   ``It felt real good,'' exulted businessman Carlos Stewart, who
paid for the pitch that dunked Denzio at ``Tax Bash'' festivities
Tuesday, three days before the midnight filing deadline. ``I've
been audited a time or two and went through a lot of stress.''
   Stewart, a businessman from Temple, Texas, was in town for a
professional conference, which, of course, remains deductible under
the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
   That act, you recall, was the sweeping tax simplification law
that somehow created 40 new tax forms to fill out and required
changes in 200 existing tax forms. (Now go to Paragraph 8:)
   Paragraph 8: IRS assistant division chief Debbie Moore wore a
``Miss 1040 EZ'' T-shirt Tuesday night. How she (a) screamed as she
(b) sat on the perch and (c) watched the baseballs whiz toward the
(d) target that would (e) collapse the seat (f) and dump her in the
(g) tank!
   She would not be exempted.
   ``I'll help you file your tax return if you don't do this,'' she
pleaded with one revenge-bent taxpayer. ``You really should be
saving your money.''
   And attaching Schedule B for dividend interest over $400. The
windup. ... The pitch. ...
   The ``Tax Bash'' at the downtown Union Station marketplace also
featured a 6-foot metal 1040 form painted on the side of a
refrigerator _ and a sledgehammer for eligible taxpayers to ``fill
in'' the boxes.
   Jeff Breeding, 19, of Indianapolis, paid $1 for three
sledgehammer blows on the 1040 form, avenging the $10 dent in his
wallet he got for a filing mistake last year. ``You got to get even
somehow,'' he said.
   The windup ... the swing ... Wham!
   There was also a character dressed as Uncle Sam available for $3
per photograph, to provide a permanent record.
   For the timorous taxpayer, the authorities provided a chance to
fill out tax returns and mail them in a special postal box.
   H&R Block representatives were on hand to offer free advice,
filing returns for a fee, with $5 per return donated, like the
sporting fees, to the Muscular Dystrophy Association _
contributions that were fully tax-deductible.
   John Hendrickson of Akron, Ohio, removed his suit jacket before
taking aim at Denzio, once again on the seat (f) above the (g)
tank. (See paragraph 8).
   The windup ... the pitch ... Whap! Splash!
   ``Put it this way,'' Hendrickson said as Denzio climbed out of
the (g) tank. ``This year was a tough year to do taxes with all the
rule changes. A lot of forms. This was a good way to balance my
frustrations by doing something constructive _ getting this guy
wet.''
   ``I'm freezing,'' Denzio complained. ``The water's cold.''
   Back on the seat (f), Denzio.
   Repeat steps (a) through (g). See paragraph 8.

   Robert Carlyle Byrd once described himself as
``a perfectionist who falls far short of perfection.''
   But this one-time meat-cutter, self-educated fiddler and student
of Shakespeare, used a lifetime of hard work, attention to detail
and an ability to change with the times to rise from the coalfields
of West Virginia to become a force in the United States Senate.
   He announced Tuesday he would give up the post of Senate
majority leader at year's end, after seeking re-election to a sixth
term as senator from West Virginia. Characteristically, he first
informed his fellow Democratic senators and his home state, by a
satellite hookup to Institute, W.Va., before going public.
   Byrd had two homes: West Virginia and the United States Senate.
   He used the Bible and the Senate rule book to make his mark in
both.
   Byrd led Senate Democrats for 10 years. He was elected majority
leader after the 1976 elections and served until 1980, when Ronald
Reagan became president and Republicans took control of the Senate.
   Six years later, when Democrats returned to power in the Senate,
Byrd regained the post after brushing aside a challenge by Sen.
Lawton Chiles of Florida.
   Until Tuesday, Byrd had kept constituents and fellow Democratic
senators in the dark about his future plans.
   When he made his announcement at a party luncheon Tuesday
afternoon, one senator who had left the room abruptly returned when
told by reporters what Byrd planned to say after dessert.
   Even Speaker of the House Jim Wright of Texas learned of Byrd's
decision from a reporter.
   Byrd's rise in the Senate _ he unseated Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
as party whip in 1971 for his first major leadership post _ was
almost as dramatic as his rise from childhood deprivation.
   Byrd was born Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. in North Wilkesboro,
N.C. His mother died at age 10, his father abandoned him and he was
sent to the coalfields to live with an aunt and uncle, Vlurma and
Titus Byrd.
   Growing up in Crab Orchard, W.Va., Byrd worked as a gas station
attendant, butcher, store clerk and welder. He learned enough to
graduate first in his high school class and he learned to play the
fiddle.
   His fiddling earned him an honorary membership in the Country
Music Association. His reading and continuing drive for education
earned him a law degree in 1963, at age 45 and after he had been a
senator for four years.
   When he first ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1952,
a past, brief membership in the Ku Klux Klan was revealed and Byrd
was urged to drop out of the race.
   Instead, he went on radio and explained that, ``being only 24 at
the time, I joined the order because it offered excitement and
because it was strongly opposed to communism. After about a year, I
became disinterested, quit paying my dues and dropped my
membership.''
   That same year he gave up drinking; he remains a teetotaler.
   Byrd started out a conservative on social issues, voting against
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and against the nomination of Thurgood
Marshall to the Supreme Court.
   But his move up the Senate ladder moderated his positions. When
he voted against a Supreme Court nominee last year, it was the
conservative Robert Bork. And when the Civil Rights Restoration Act
was enacted over a presidential veto this year, Byrd was a strong
supporter.
   For all that, he has remained an individual, priding himself in
his vast knowledge of Senate rules, his ability to recite poetry at
length on the Senate floor, his ongoing re-reading of the Bible, of
the works of Shakespeare and even the dictionary, page by page,
word by word.

   Robert Byrd's decision to step down from
the U.S. Senate's top post and become chairman of the powerful
Appropriations Committee was welcomed by political figures in his
economically struggling state.
   Byrd's job as majority leader gave him enormous power to direct
the flow of legislation in the Capitol. But at home, where he is
running for his sixth six-year term, his clout in Washington has
been overshadowed by criticism that he has done little for West
Virginia, a state mired in poverty and financial troubles.
   ``West Virginia is hurting,'' Byrd said Tuesday. ``The recession
that began in 1981 dealt a crippling blow to West Virginia. The
economic recovery that other regions have enjoyed has for the most
part bypassed our state.''
   The state in December reclaimed the national lead in
unemployment, when it surpassed Louisiana with an 11.4 percent
jobless rate. Joblessness swelled to 13.2 percent in February, the
latest federal statistics available. One recent study found that
slightly less than one-fourth of children in West Virginia living
in poverty.
   The state also has long ranked low on the list of recipients of
federal aid, once ``transfer payments'' to individuals such as food
stamps and Social Security are excluded. Byrd said he hopes to do
something about that as chairman of the appropriations panel.
   Byrd said he ``cannot work miracles'' but he will have ``a new
opportunity to have a more direct influence on the allocation of
our nation's scarce fiscal resources.''
   Several state political leaders had urged Byrd this week to
choose the appropriations chairmanship, saying he could do more for
the state there.
   ``As majority leader, you are being a choir director for a whole
bunch of people, which minimizes the time and dilutes the
opportunities you have for your own agenda, for your own state or
district,'' said Huntington Mayor Bobby Nelson, a former state
senator who once served as a Capitol Hill aide.
   ``I'd tell him to take the appropriations chairmanship. He can
keep up better with the state and still have a powerful impact over
his colleagues.''
   Republican Gov. Arch Moore, a longtime political foe, was one of
few West Virginia politicians to criticize Byrd's decision.
   ``I would be hard-pressed to suggest that West Virginians will
notice any difference as a result of the change,'' he said in a
statement.
   Byrd's seniority gives him first option on the chairmanship,
which is being vacated by retiring Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss.
Tradition would prevent Byrd from serving as party leader and
appropriations committee chairman.
   After serving in the state Legislature, Byrd was elected to the
House of Representatives three times beginning in 1952. In 1958, he
was elected to the Senate. He became majority whip in 1971 and
majority leader in 1977.
   He faces Bobbie Myers, a Huntington moving company executive, in
West Virginia's May 10 primary election. The winner will face state
Sen. Jay Wolfe or Buckhannon resident Bernie Lumbert, both
Republicans, in the general election.

   George Bush, captain of his college baseball
team at Yale, jumped at the chance to pitch the first ball when the
New York Mets hosted the Montreal Expos at Shea Stadium.
   But first he warmed up, tossing an apple back and forth on Air
Force II with Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y., who crouched down in a
catcher's position.
   When his time in came Tuesday, the former first baseman donned a
blue Mets jacked and hurled the ball to Mets catcher Gary Carter.
   ``I was worried about making the plate, but Gary Carter surged
forward and I stopped a little short of the rubber on that,'' Bush
recounted.
   New York Mayor Ed Koch was also present for the Mets' home
opener, and talked briefly with Bush at the start of the game.
   ``I knew George Bush in Congress,'' the Democratic mayor told
reporters, suggesting they were old friends.
   But did he plan to vote for Bush for president? Koch was asked.
``Don't be ridiculous,'' the mayor responded.

   George Bush says he's been getting lots of advice on a running
mate, but none of it is solicited.
   The Republican vice president says he hasn't even begun thinking
about the subject yet.
   Still, the vice president has told reporters that suggestions
keep coming to him ``over the transom, under the door in plain
manilla envelopes.''
   At least once, this stock answer came out ``plain vanilla
envelopes.'' And more recently, the suggestions have come to him in
``plain brown evelopes.''
   One unsolicited recommendation came from former President
Richard Nixon, who suggested on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' show last
Sunday that Bush should team up with his defeated rival, Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole.
   Bush said the proposal ``was interesting,'' and noted: ``It
wasn't over the transom or under the door. It was on Channel
Four.'' That was a reference to the NBC station that airs Meet the
Press in Washington.
   It may have been in mock response to Nixon's comments that
Democrat Michael Dukakis was a word processor and Jesse Jackson a
poet.
   During his current campaign swing through New York state, Bush
was asked by reporters in Syracuse whether there was ``a Dole in
your future,'' a reference that included both the Senate minority
leader and his wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   ``Could be,'' responded the vice president. ``I have great
respect for Elizabeth. ... Bob tells me she really wants to help
too. All of that is positive.''
   However he went on to insist that he still hasn't given the
matter much thought.

   A Guyanese immigrant convicted of killing his
girlfriend and four members of her family, including a 4-year-old
girl, in a jealous rage was executed early Wednesday in Louisiana's
electric chair.
   Leslie Lowenfield, 34, professed his innocence as he was led
into the death chamber.
   ``The one who did this is still out there,'' he said in a final
statement.
   Moments earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to put off the
execution.
   Lowenfield was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m., said Roger Thomas,
an assistant warden at the Louisiana State Penitentiary.
   It was Louisiana's second execution this year, and the nation's
fourth.
   Lowenfield's attorneys argued that he was mentally ill and
therefore unable to understand the death penalty. They took their
final plea to the high court after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, U.S. District Judge Peter Beer and the Louisiana Supreme
Court all turned down appeals Tuesday.
   Five of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices opposed delaying
the execution. Justice William Brennan wrote a dissent, joined by
Thurgood Marshall. Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens issued a
separate statement indicating they would have granted the requested
stay, spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in Washington, D.C.
   Warden Hilton Butler said Lowenfield kept hoping until the end
for a fifth delay of as many execution dates.
   Butler said Lowenfield spurned the condemned's customary last
meal and spent the evening with Dale Brown, the head basketball
coach from Louisiana State University.
   Brown, widely recognized as a motivational speaker, had been
corresponding with Lowenfield since he took the LSU team on a tour
of Angola's death row in 1984, Butler said.
   A Catholic priest and nun also were with Lowenfield, the warden
said.
   Lowenfield, a welder from Guyana who came to the United States
in 1981 on a work permit, was convicted in 1984 in the August 1982
slayings of his estranged girlfriend, who was a Jefferson Parish
sheriff's deputy, and four others.
   The case has alrady been appealed unsuccessfully to both the
state's highest court and the U.S. Supreme Court. Lawyers based
their latest appeal on a recent psychological study that found the
prisoner to be a paranoid schizophrenic.
   ``There is a serious question about Leslie's competency to be
executed due to his mental illness,'' said Judith Menadue, attorney
for the Louisiana Capital Defense Project.
   She said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that people who cannot
understand what it means to be executed may not be put to death.
   Before the trial, Lowenfield was found competent, and he refused
to allow his lawyers to use insanity as a defense, insisting
instead that he was in Florida at the time the family was killed.
But no witnesses backed up his story of being out of state.
   The denial of the stay was issued without further comment from
the state Supreme Court majority, but the one member who backed the
appeal issued a brief dissent.
   ``The clinical psychologist who spent five hours with the
defendant concluded: `Lowenfield indicated that he is currently
unable to understand the death penalty,''' Justice John A. Dixon
wrote.
   He noted that criminal law calls for halting prosecution when
there are reasonable grounds to doubt a defendant's sanity, and for
going ahead after that only when the defendant is found to have the
mental capacity to do so.
   Prosecutors said Lowenfield barged into his girlfriend's house
in Marrero, a New Orleans suburb, and shot everybody there.
   The victims were the girlfriend, Sheila Thomas, 27; her
daughter, Shantel Osborne, 4; her stepfather, Owen Griffin, 45; her
mother, Myrtle Griffin, 44; and the little girl's father, Carl
Osborne, 33.
   The prosecution said Lowenfield was jealous of Miss Thomas. They
said the couple had lived together in a stormy relationship until
earlier in the summer of 1982 when he set the house on fire and she
moved out.
   Investigators found a notebook full of obscenities and threats.
In one place he wrote, ``She have to go to the wormes she took all
I work for then leave to go and be with Carl but I just cannot take
it eany more.''
   Lowenfield was arrested two months later in New York.
   Parts of the evidence against him were letters he wrote Miss
Thomas' relatives while he was jailed in New York. One said Osborne
had grabbed the child as a shield and Lowenfield had shot both of
them.
   On trial, Lowenfield insisted on an alibi defense, saying he was
in Jacksonville, Fla., looking for work at the time of the murders.
   After a separate trial to determine the penalty, jurors came
back three times saying they could not decide whether he should
die. Prodded on by the judge, they decided on the fourth try to
condemn him to death.

<HEAD>Businessmen Paid More than $150,000 Each to Buy Reagan's New House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two industrialists who have been members of
President Reagan's ``kitchen cabinet'' and other wealthy
businessmen paid at least $156,000 each to buy the California home
the Reagans will occupy when they leave the White House.
   A Washington law firm disclosed the information Tuesday by
releasing an exchange of letters with the Office of Government
Ethics in July 1986.
   Businessmen Holmes Tuttle and Earle Jorgensen are among the 20
or so people who helped buy the home, the newly released documents
show when paired with articles of incorporation on file with the
state in Sacramento, Calif.
   Tuttle, whose son Robert is director of the White House
personnel office, is a California automotive dealer and
industrialist. Jorgensen is chairman of a steel and aluminum
distribution company, and both men have been members of Reagan's
``kitchen cabinet'' of unofficial advisers.
   An informal opinion by the Ethics Office noted that the
president is subject to neither the criminal conflict-of-interest
laws nor standards of conduct for the executive branch of
government set out in a 1965 presidential order.
   If the group of businessmen decided to give the Bel Air estate
to the Reagans, the president would not violate the standards of
conduct regulations for the executive office of the president as
long as personal friendship was the motivating factor in the
transaction, said the ethics office.
   However, it said the president must take care not to give
preferential treatment to any of the approximately 20 investors.
   The new documents were released after reporters made inquiries
at the ethics office. One of the law firm's partners, Robert
Washington, has represented the real estate holding company set up
exclusively for the Reagan house purchase, Wall Management Services
Inc.
   The lawyers for Wall Management were seeking an opinion on the
ethical and legal implications of buying and renovating a home for
the Reagans that would be sold or leased to the president.
   ``Based upon the facts as you have presented them to us, it
appears that your proposal will not run afoul of the applicable
standards of conduct and conflict of interest statutes,'' the
opinion said.
   The request to the ethics office did say the president has
appointed some of the investors, their spouses or relatives to
various commissions or federal posts.
   Standards of conduct for the executive office of the president
prohibit the use of public office for private gain or the giving of
preferential treatment to anyone.
   ``Once this proposal gets under way, the president and the
individuals involved will have to be careful not to take any
actions that would reflect adversely on standards of conduct
matters,'' said the opinion by then-ethics office director David
Martin.
   The Reagans began paying rent on the home in the exclusive Bel
Air section of Los Angeles under a three-year lease which took
effect March 1. The Reagans have an option to buy, and the White
House says the first couple is paying fair market rent.
   In an interview, Wall Management's chief financial officer, Ira
Revich, said ``approximately 20'' friends of the Reagans had bought
stock in the company. He refused to identify them. The documents
written in 1986 mention ``a group of about 18 individuals.''

   Swiss banks and large financial
institutions will come under closer supervision in accepting funds
from foreign leaders, the Swiss Banking Commission said.
   The cases of deposed presidents Ferdinand Marcos of the
Philippines and Jean-Claude Duvalier of Haiti created the need for
the stronger surveillance, the regulatory agency said Tuesday in
its annual report.
   Philippines officials claim Marcos kept up to $5 billion in
Switzerland during his 20-year rule. Duvalier is alleged to have
diverted several hundred million dollars into Swiss accounts. Both
were ousted from office in 1986.
   The commission's probe of the case failed to find any wrongdoing
by the banks involved, which were not named. But the agency said it
will now require top management of Swiss banks, rather than
lower-ranking employees, to judge whether to take up or continue
``such exposed business ties.''
   The panel also called for tougher Swiss laws against money
laundering, terming existing measures insufficient to combat the
practice.

   The man impersonating Abraham Lincoln
could have fooled some of the people at least some of the time.
   Jim Sayre, a 52-year-old truck dispatcher from Lawrenceburg,
Ky., defeated six other presidential impersonators Tuesday night in
a contest sponsored by the Herbert Hoover Museum and Library.
   Sayre, who bears a striking resemblance to the 16th president,
started sounding presidential as soon as he donned his stovepipe
hat, and began making speeches in the parking lot before the
contest.
   ``Everyone takes freedom for granted,'' Sayre said. ``And we
don't need to do that. We need to know people died to gain this
freedom.''
   Sayre handed out cards saying ``Honest, It's Abe.''
   He said he had been impersonating Lincoln since a friend
encouraged him to enter a contest six years ago. ``I've always
enjoyed history but I never did any in-depth study on Lincoln until
I started this,'' Sayre said.
   ``He mostly does it because he loves it,'' said Sayre's wife,
Mary.
   As President Ulysses S. Grant, Tom Hildreth apologized for his
hard-drinking ways.
   ``Some people say I drink too much, smoke too much and cuss too
much,'' Hildreth's Grant said. ``Well, I am who I am. I hope I
don't offend anybody too much.''
   Sayre, who beat impersonators from Iowa and Illinois who
portrayed presidents Lincoln, Grant, Kennedy, Nixon, Carter and
Reagan, will help Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad open the museum's ``39
Men'' exhibit April 23.
   The exhibit features more than 200 presidential artifacts
including John F. Kennedy's rocking chair, Dwight Eisenhower's golf
clubs, Gerald Ford's football helmet, Lincoln's shawl, Harry
Truman's fedora and walking stick and an original copy of the
famous ``Dewey Defeats Truman'' headline from the Nov. 4, 1948,
issue of the Chicago Tribune.
   Also in the exhibit will be Calvin Coolidge's electric exercise
horse and Theodore Roosevelt's branding iron.

   Albert Gore Jr. sharpened his criticism of
Michael Dukakis at a debate by the Democratic candidates, bluntly
challenging the front-runner on welfare, prison management and the
Middle East.
   Jesse Jackson stayed clear of the confrontation as Gore and
Dukakis wrangled, sometimes heatedly, at Tuesday's forum. Dukakis
at one point indirectly suggested that Gore's candidacy may not
last long.
   ``Don't lick your chops too soon, Governor Dukakis,'' Gore
responded. ``New York's going to have a bigger say about that than
you will.''
   The sharp comment was one of several fired off by Gore, who has
been waging an aggressive campaign in hopes of reviving his
flagging candidacy. Three more Democratic forums are planned before
the state's April 19 primary.
   Jackson played the conciliator, admonishing the audience for
booing Gore and clearly enjoying the limelight. After a lifetime as
an underdog, he said, ``Now I'm one of the top dogs, and I just
love it.''
   The booing came with Gore's first offensive, in which he
maintained that it was ``not a personal attack'' for him to
criticize Jackson's advocacy of a Palestinian state. Gore went on
to say Dukakis had expressed ``a lot more enthusiasm'' for such a
state than Gore had.
   ``I didn't express enthusiasm for a Palestinian state,'' Dukakis
shot back, tapping a table top with his fingers. ``I expressed
enthusiasm for presidential leadership'' for peace in the region.
   Much is riding on the New York primary for Gore, who has yet to
win a northern industrial state. He has campaigned pugnaciously
enough for some party leaders to call on him to tone down his
criticisms of his opponents.
   Dukakis took that tack early on in the debate, which was
sponsored by the Daily News. ``Ultimately this is a race against
(George) Bush,'' the likely Republican nominee, he said.
   But Gore said in closing remarks, ``It's not a personal attack
to note for the record that neither of my opponents has had a
single day's experience in foreign policy.''
   Gore also launched a direct blast on the issue of welfare
policy, charging that Dukakis' new proposed state budget includes
``very, very deep cuts'' in poverty programs.
   ``That's absolutely incorrect,'' Dukakis responded.
   ``The newspaper accounts are wrong then,'' said Gore.
   ``No,'' Dukakis shot back. ``You're wrong. You're wrong.''
   Dukakis' budget plan proposes a 5.5 percent boost in Aid to
Families with Dependent Children, just enough to offset inflation.
The budget proposes more than $50 million for other, new programs
for the poor and homeless, and AFDC benefits have risen by 47
percent the past five years.
   Gore also went after Dukakis on prison policy, saying the
governor had backed a state program providing two-week furloughs to
prisoners, including convicted murderers, in which 11 prisoners
fled and two killed again.
   Dukakis responded with some apparent rancor. ``Al, the
difference between you and me is that I have to run a criminal
justice system,'' he said. ``You never have.'' He cited low crime
statistics in his state and said prisoners must be prepared to
re-enter society.
   Dukakis said his state's program had been revised to exclude
prisoners serving life terms and it was widely approved by
correction professionals.
   Jackson rejected Gore's claim that New York favors underdogs.
   ``I do not think that New York has an underdog complex,'' he
said. ``I was an underdog for 45 years and 11 months. And now I'm
one of the top dogs and I just love it. New York loves a winner.
And I'm a winner.''

<HEAD>Robertson, Campaign Organization Sued for Back Rent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHESAPEAKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rental company is suing Republican
presidential candidate Pat Robertson and his campaign organization
for $74,606 in unpaid rent, the company's lawyer says.
   The campaign was already about three months behind in rent
payments for a suite of offices at Greenbrier Tower I when it moved
out last December, breaking its lease, said Roger Schafer, an
attorney for Greenbrier Tower I Associates.
   ``The defendants have failed to make the required payment of the
rent and late charges due under the lease, and therefore are in
default,'' Schafer said Tuesday.
   A spokesman for Americans for Robertson, the candidate's
campaign organization, said the campaign has been negotiating
payment with its former landlords but was not aware that they
planned to sue.
   ``There have been negotiations between our offices on the terms
of that lease, and we have been working with them on a repayment
schedule,'' said Barbara Gattullo, a campaign spokesman.
   The campaign owes money to other vendors but is not being sued
for payment by any other company, Ms. Gattullo said.
   ``As far as I know, this is an isolated case,'' she said. ``I do
know we have made arrangements with many of our vendors to put them
on a payment schedule, but that is nothing unusual.''
   Robertson, a former religious broadcaster from Virginia Beach,
has lost a string of presidential primaries and acknowledges that
he is unlikely to win the 1988 Republican nomination.
   Americans for Robertson has scaled back operations dramatically,
cutting staff and expenses to avoid exceeding federal campaign
spending limits.
   Robertson initially had his national campaign headquarters at
the suite of offices at Greenbrier Tower I but has relocated to
more austere offices nearby.
   Robertson himself is being sued in the rent dispute because he
signed the lease, Schafer said.
   About $18,000 of the $74,606 is back rent Robertson's campaign
owed before it moved from the building, Schafer said. Robertson and
his campaign owe the remainder for breaking the terms of the lease
by moving, he said.
   The suit was filed in Chesapeake Circuit Court last week but
will not be processed until court clerks receive a filing fee that
Schafer's office mailed Tuesday, he said.

   State-run television interrupted its programming
to announce hijackers had freed 12 hostages from a Kuwaiti jet
before the plane left Cyprus for Algeria. But fear lingered for
about 35 captives still aboard the plane.
   The television network played patriotic songs after the
announcement Tuesday of the development in the hijacking that began
April 5 when terrorists commandeered the Boeing 747 on a flight
from Thailand to Kuwait.
   The gunmen first forced the pilots to land in Mashhad, Iran,
where 57 hostages were freed, and then to Cyprus. There two Kuwaiti
passengers were killed and their bodies thrown onto the runway and
one passenger was freed.
   Among the hostages aboard when the jet left for Algeria were
three members of the extensive Kuwaiti royal family _ a businessman
and his two sisters.
   In addition to the hostages, there are between six and eight
Arab hijackers armed with grenades and handguns.
   State television, in an urgent broadcast, reported the departure
of the Kuwait Airways jet for Algeria.
   The minister of state for foreign affairs, Saud Al-Mazidi, told
the official Kuwait News Agency that Algeria had agreed to receive
the plane after talks with Kuwaiti leaders on Tuesday.
   He said Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, conferred
with Algerian President Chedli Benjedid, and Crown Prince Saad
Abdullah Al-Sabah contacted Algeria's prime minister, Abdul-Hamid
Ibrahimi.
   Al-Mazidi thanked Algeria, Cyprus and the Palestine Liberation
Organization for helping arrange the release of the 12 hostages and
the flight to Algeria.
   Word that the passengers had been freed came at 10:30 p.m., just
as many people in Kuwait were preparing to retire for the night.
   Television postponed a scheduled drama to broadcast bulletins
and patriotic songs with a background of landmarks and Kuwaiti
flags.
   As the jetliner prepared to take off, the television broadcast
live from the airport at Larnaca, Cyprus, for 15 minutes including
radio conversations between the tower and hijackers. The report
ended before the plane departed.
   There was little public reaction visible at midnight in this
desert city.
   Kuwait, in line with the Islamic prohibition of alcoholic
beverages, has no bars and many businesses open at 7 a.m. and close
early. Nights are quiet.
   Several Kuwaitis on a midnight excursion to the U.S.-style
Sultan Center supermarket expressed happiness for the freed
hostages.
   ``I feel very happy for the 12 people, but I want now to know
about the others,'' said Khalid Juma, a man wearing a traditional
Arab robe.
   ``They are our brothers, and we saw them on television when they
(the hijackers) killed two and dropped them from the plane,'' he
said as he stepped out of a Mercedes Benz sedan.
   Another Kuwaiti, Juba Al-Mohammed, said: ``They have to release
everyone, not just 12.''

   Here is a chronology of events in the hijacking of Kuwait
Airways Flight 422:
   April 5 _ The Boeing 747 with 112 people aboard, including three
members of the Kuwaiti royal family, is hijacked on a flight to
Kuwait from Bangkok and diverted to Mashhad in northeastern Iran.
The Arab hijackers demand freedom for 17 pro-Iranian extremists
jailed in Kuwait for their convictions in the bombings of the U.S.
and French embassies there in 1983. They threaten to blow up the
plane if the demand is not met. Kuwait refuses. One passenger with
heart condition is released. Kuwait asks Iran not to allow the
plane to take off.
   April 6 _ Kuwait sends a team to Iran to negotiate with the
hijackers but vows not to yield to their demands. The hijackers
release 24 women and call a doctor on board to treat passengers
they describe as ``unwell.''
   April 7 _ The hijackers release 32 more hostages. The plane is
refueled after hijackers shoot at airport security and threaten to
force the plane to take off with fuel tanks near empty.
   April 8 _ The plane leaves Mashhad but is refused permission to
land in Beirut and Damascus. After seven hours in the air, the
plane lands at Larnaca, Cyprus.
   April 9 _ The hijackers kill a Kuwaiti security guard on the
plane after their demands for fuel are not met. The pilot says
captives are being beaten. Another captive is freed after a PLO
official and two Cypriot officials go to the plane and talk with
the hijackers.
   April 10 _ Negotiations with PLO officials continue. The
hijackers threaten a ``slow and quiet massacre'' and say they will
force the pilot to take off and crash into the Kuwaiti royal palace
if demands are not met. In Lebanon, the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad
terrorist group threatens to kill kidnapped foreign hostages if any
attempt is made to storm the plane.
   April 11 _ The hijackers kill a second captive, identified as a
Kuwaiti security officer. A passenger tells airport officials via
radio the hijackers have threatened to shoot all the passengers if
the plane is not refueled.
   April 12 _ Twelve more hostages are freed.
   April 13 _ Plane flies from Cyprus to Algiers, Algeria.

   The closing of this year's National People's
Congress, with its stress on reforms, marks the end of the career
of Peng Zhen, a stodgy conservative who made the legislature into a
force to be reckoned with.
   Peng's five-year term as chairman officially ended Friday, when
he was replaced by reform-minded former Vice Premier Wan Li.
   The 86-year-old Peng was a harsh critic of senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's reforms of the past decade and developed his own power
base in the legislature to slow down the pace of change.
   He was a strong advocate of state control over economic,
political and social life in China and saw market-style economic
reform and opening to the outside world as bringing in
``pernicious'' capitalist and Western trends.
   Peng was believed to have been behind the January 1987 ouster of
party chief Hu Yaobang, who was blamed for pro-democracy student
demonstrations staged in a dozen cities around the country that
winter.
   He was a leading figure in the campaign against bourgeois
liberalization, or Western ideas, that followed the protests.
Several leading intellectuals were purged from the party as a
result.
   Peng's leadership role in the congress began in 1979, not long
after he returned to Beijing from the mountains of Shaanxi
province, where he had spent the Cultural Revolution years.
   He was made head of the congress' legislative committee and
drafted a criminal code that was adopted the same year.
   Peng presented a new state constitution to the congress in 1982
that substantially increased the powers of the legislature.
   The constitution gave the congress, until then a powerless and
largely ceremonial body, the power to enact laws and supervise the
State Council.
   The following year, Peng became chairman of the legislature and
under his leadership it began to shed its image as a rubber stamp
for all party dictates.
   Peng shrugged off suggestions that he was an anti-Deng Xiaoping
``conservative'' and, like all Chinese leaders, claimed loyalty to
the idea of reform. But he also openly criticized the decline of
orthodox Marxist principles and warned of the dangers of
liberalization.
   Peng's official biography says he was born in 1902 to a peasant
family in Shanxi province, and joined the Communist Party in 1923.
   He rose through the party ranks, acquiring a reputation for his
organizational and administrative skills.
   Unlike most of his contemporaries, Peng did not participate in
the Long March and therefore did not establish early ties with Mao
Tse-tung, but he was closely associated with former President Liu
Shaoqi.
   He became mayor of Beijing in 1951, and directed mass executions
of ``counterrevolutionaries'' in the capital that same year.
   He continued to live up to his reputation for heavy-handed
methods as one of the main forces behind a major anti-crime
campaign launched in 1983 that in four years has resulted in the
executions of more than 10,000 criminals.
   Peng was one of the first victims of the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, accused of attempting to stage a coup against Mao.
   He was stripped of all his posts, banished for 12 years to the
Chining Mountains of Shaanxi province, and not rehabilitated until
1979.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police chief's abrupt resignation amid
controversy over minority shootings and the killing of three
officers has prompted one city leader to demand that his successor
be an outsider and black.
   Billy Prince, 45, announced his immediate resignation on
Tuesday, saying he had realized on Easter Sunday, at the end of an
11-day vacation, that he dreaded returning to work.
   ``I feel kind of run-over here,'' said Prince, who has been a
policeman for 24 years, six of them as chief. ``It's come to the
point when it's time to let someone else get in the middle, and
that's what I've decided to do.''
   Within minutes, the city's ranking black elected official, City
Councilwoman Diane Ragsdale called for hiring a black police chief
from outside Dallas.
   ``I think it would be a sad mistake for the police chief not to
come from outside this city,'' Ms. Ragsdale, who has sharply
criticized police relations with minorities, said Tuesday.
   ``We don't need contaminated leadership ... mired in the past,''
she said. ``We need brand new leadership to bring this city into
the 20th century.''
   City Manager Richard Knight, who is black, named first assistant
police chief Louie C. Caudell, a white, as interim chief in the
nation's seventh-largest city.
   Knight, who has hiring authority, said he has not decided
whether he would continue the 43-year tradition of promoting a new
chief from within the department.
   ``We have invited any internal candidates who are interested to
by all means apply, and we will also be looking nationally,''
Knight said.
   Prince came under fire for criticizing City Council members and
opposing reforms in his department, which came under congressional
review because of police shootings, most of them black and Hispanic.
   He has been caught between the demands of City Council members
who want more police accountability, including broader powers of a
civilian review board, and the Dallas Police Association, a private
coalition that opposes greater control.
   He was rebuked by Knight and Mayor Annette Strauss when he said
criticism of the department had created a climate of hostility that
set the stage for the January slaying of Officer John Glenn Chase
by a vagrant goaded by black youths.
   Although the three publicly reconciled, the rift continued to
grow.
   Prince said his decision to resign was ``totally my own'' and
that he would serve as an adviser through the summer. ``I don't
want to be a lame-duck leader or a lame-duck chief,'' he said.
   Two other officers were slain this year and Prince ordered
officers to patrol in pairs for safety.
   The Chase shooting and the feud produced a backlash of support
for the police in Dallas, and the DPA collected 20,000 signatures
to force a referendum on the review board.
   The department's problems continue. Last week, a state judge
held the city liable for damages in a wrongful death lawsuit
brought by the widow of a suburban officer killed by a Dallas
officer in a bungled drug raid.
   The judge found the Dallas department had withheld evidence in
the case.

<HEAD>China's Legislature Ends Annual Session Devoted To Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's parliament today ended an annual 20-day
session hailed as its most democratic and open ever by passing laws
that reconfirm the government's commitment to economic reform.
   The National People's Congress' 2,900 delegates approved a
government work report by Premier Li Peng urging more
market-oriented reforms while acknowledging serious problems with
rising prices and faltering agricultural production. There were
three opposing votes and six abstentions.
   The congress produced few surprises and solidified Communist
Party leader Zhao Ziyang's position as the nation's strongest
political figure behind his mentor, semi-retired senior leader Deng
Xiaoping.
   Zhao, 69, who became party chief last year after seven years as
premier, advocates further opening to the outside world and a rapid
shift away from central planning and toward a more efficient,
competitive economy.
   The congress, as expected, named Gen. Yang Shangkun as state
president and Wan Li as chairman of the congress. Both are allies
of Deng and Zhao and solid supporters of reform. They replaced the
conservative Li Xiannian and Peng Zhen.
   On Tuesday, the legislature also named a new State Council, or
parliament, that stressed continuity with Zhao's policies. A
majority of ministers either retained their posts or turned them
over to younger bureaucrats within their ministries.
   Li Peng, 59, who was confirmed as premier earlier in the
session, is regarded as more concerned with economic stability than
reform. But his work report, delivered on the opening day of the
session, backed Zhao's reform program, tempered only by several
warnings against being too impetuous in revamping the economic
system.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said more than 100 changes were
made in the final version of the report, with more emphasis given
to education and the issue of China's minority nationalities.
   The revised report encourages employees of universities and
institutes to provide paid social services, a controversial issue
that has spurred protests during the congress by students and
teachers who say education is underfunded and that academics should
not be made to do outside work to boost college incomes and
compensate for low salaries.
   The report emphasizes the importance of protecting the rights of
China's minorities. Buddhist monks in Tibet in the past six months
have led violent demonstrations against what they say is oppression
by authorities in Beijing.
   The delegates passed, with two opposing votes and 11
abstentions, an enterprise law which is to end direct state
controls over state enterprises and give factory managers greater
authority over their operations.
   Under the law, managers will be responsible for profits and
losses and, after consultation with local worker unions, can decide
on hiring and firing, bonuses and punishments for workers.
   The party secretaries who previously had final say over business
operations are ordered not to interfere with day-to-day affairs.
   Other bills passed included a joint-venture law guaranteeing
that foreign investors will have a favorable climate for investing
in Chinese industry, and a bill making Hainan Island off the
southern coast of China into a province.
   Hainan also was declared a special economic zone, giving it
powers to offer better conditions in order to attract foreign
investment.
   During the nationally televised final session, several delegates
stood up to state opinions about the activities of the congress.
   One woman delegate voiced concern that the government might not
give proper attention to the opinions raised by delegates during
the session. Another deputy complained that he had received the
revised version of the enterprise law only that morning and did not
have time to study it properly.
   A woman delegate from Hong Kong said she was unhappy with a line
in Li's work report criticizing capitalism. China has promised Hong
Kong it can keep its capitalist system after Britain returns the
colony to China in 1997.
   Zhao, Deng and others on the podium could be seen listening
intently to her short speech.

<HEAD>Arizona Supreme Court Cancels Gubernatorial Recall Vote</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court canceled the
gubernatorial recall election, denying Evan Mecham a last,
desperate chance to return to office in what could be the final
word to 15 months of political upheaval.
   The court did not provide a detailed explanation of Tuesday's
4-1 decision, which means the new governor, Democrat Rose Mofford,
would serve out Mecham's term through 1990.
   The 65-year-old former secretary of state became governor on
April 4 when her Republican predecessor was convicted on
impeachment charges by the Senate.
   The court said that since Mecham already has been removed, the
regular order of succession must take precedence over the state
Constitution's recall provisions.
   Mecham Recall Committee founder Ed Buck, who had favored holding
the election, said his reaction still was one of relief.
   ``I'm a little bit disappointed because I think a recall
election would have given us the opportunity to put Evan Mecham
behind us once and for all,'' Buck said, ``because Evan Mecham
would have received so few votes that he and his supporters would
see how weak Evan Mecham really was.''
   The former governor said he planned to make a statement this
evening about his plans.
   ``We've been handed a bucket of lemons and we're going to make a
barrel of lemonade,'' Mecham told supporters in Mesa. ``There isn't
anything in the law, in the Constitution, that says that the
Supreme Court can cancel this election.''
   Mecham was removed last week from the ballot in the May 17
election, which was called after nearly 400,000 Arizonans signed
petitions last year. He would have faced a court battle if he
decided to attempt a candidacy.
   The recall was challenged by two taxpayers who contended it was
no longer necessary and would be a waste of money. Their attorney,
Andrew Gordon, told the court Tuesday, ``The purpose of the recall
has been fulfilled. ... Recall is the people's alternative to
impeachment.''
   Mrs. Mofford returned to Phoenix on Tuesday from Washington
D.C., where she had been lobbying for the Central Arizona Project
and for the state bid for a federal atom-smasher.
   ``I can see that the Constitution is working in Arizona, working
well,'' she told reporters. ``I'm glad to be home and looking
forward to moving ahead in Arizona.''
   However, Republican recall candidate Jack Londen said he would
consider challenging the Supreme Court decision in federal court.
He said he thought the decision violated his due process rights as
a candidate and taxpayer.
   ``I'm shocked,'' Londen said, adding that he believes the
Constitution allows voters to recall a governor and choose the next
one.
   Mecham, 63, was convicted by the Senate of trying to thwart a
death threat investigation and misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   He still faces a May 19 criminal trial on charges of concealing
a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Republican recall candidate John Rhodes, the 71-year-old former
U.S. House minority leader, issued a statement saying he was
disappointed but was willing to support Mrs. Mofford.
   ``Like the little boy that Abraham Lincoln told about, `I'm too
old to cry, but it hurts too much to laugh,''' said Rhodes, who had
planned to hold a fund-raiser Tuesday night in Washington D.C.

<TEXT>
   For more than a decade Algeria has
played a pivotal role in crises involving hostages _ from a 1977
airline hijacking by Japanese terrorists to this week's grim
odyssey of a commandeered Kuwait Airways jet.
   At one point, Algeria adopted a policy of not accepting
hijackers after it drew critical reaction for mediating deals and
was accused of being a sanctuary for terrorists.
   But it gained international prestige for helping end the crisis
in which 52 Americans were held by Iranian revolutionaries who
seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979. The hostages
were held for 444 days before being flown from Iran to Algeria and
freedom in January 1981.
   The non-aligned North African nation uses secret diplomacy and
maintains a practice in diplomatic exchanges of following other
countries' wishes.
   In 1985, Trans World Airline Flight 847, carrying 145 passengers
and eight crew members, flew twice to Algeria in a harrowing
journey that began June 14 and ended 17 days later.
   On the first day, 19 U.S. women, an American child and three
people of other nationalities were released at the Algiers airport.
The plane flew to Beirut, Lebanon the following day and then
returned to Algiers where 53 additional passengers and five flight
attendants were freed in exchange for the release of a comrade of
the hijackers at the Athens airport.
   Starting in November 1980, Algeria reluctantly agreed to work as
mediator in U.S.-Iranian negotiations to free the captive embassy
personnel in Tehran.
   ``A happy ending might change the American view that we are
communists,'' a senior Algerian official said at the time.
   In October 1977, Algerian officials negotiated face-to-face at
the foot of a Japanese Airlines DC-8 hijacked by Japanese Red Army
guerrillas. The negotiators secured the release of the hostages in
exchange for a $6 million ransom payment and the release of six Red
Army members in Japanese jails.
   Officials later indicated the hijackers were allowed to slip out
of the country.
   Algeria had agreed to let the plane land after a written request
from the Japanese government, but it was roundly denounced by
people who said Algeria was too lax with the hijackers.
   In a statement later, the government of then-President Houari
Boumedienne made it clear Algeria would not agree to use force
against hijackers.
   ``Experience has shown that it is only by accepting the demands
of hijackers that it has been possible to save the lives of
hijacked passengers,'' said the statement, transmitted by the
official Algerian news agency.
   ``All those who disagree can go ask the opinion of (hijacked)
passengers,'' it added.

<HEAD>Democratic Lawmakers Begin Choosing Super Delegates From Own Ranks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats in the House and Senate went behind
closed doors to begin deciding who among them will be delegates to
the Democratic National Convention, while a tight presidential race
hangs in the balance.
   ``We're proceeding on the basis of seniority,'' Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said Tuesday evening as he emerged
from the Capitol's Lyndon B. Johnson room after a half-hour closed
session to nominate 32 senators to be delegates.
   The House and Senate Democrats next week finish the selection of
more than 250 of their members who will be delegates, representing
more than a third of as many as 646 ``super delegates'' to the
national convention.
   Tuesday's meetings were secret, despite a provision in the
Democratic Party's charter that requires all meetings held under
its auspices to be open to the public.
   ``We really have no authority on their rules,'' said Jim Carey,
executive director of the party's Compliance Assistance Commission,
which is charged with enforcement of the rules. ``They have every
right to decide how their meetings are run.''
   Carey said the House Democratic Caucus and the Democratic
Conference of the Senate are not ``official Democratic National
Committee entities,'' even though both are picking delegates to go
to the national convention and the rules for picking the delegates
were approved by his commission, which also helped to write them.
   Among the 32 senators nominated Tuesday was Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md., a freshman who was picked because she is the only
Democratic female in the Senate, according to Byrd.
   Byrd did not name any other senators on the list and did not say
whether every senator wanting to be a delegate had been nominated.
   An aide to Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan said Levin also is among
the 32 senators nominated.
   However, Senate sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that some low-seniority senators who had asked to be delegates
were not nominated.
   Those senators and others get a second crack at being picked.
Nominations to fill the remaining 11 delegate slots from the Senate
had to be filed by noon on Friday. Lists of nominees are to be
circulated among Democratic senators, who will vote next week.
   This week's meeting and the lists of nominees are secret.
   Next week's vote is to be in public.
   ``I think that this will probably be a five- to six-second
operation,'' Linda Peek, a spokeswoman for the Senate Democrats,
said of the actual election of Senate delegates. ``The names are
read, the conference votes and the names are released within a
matter of minutes. I don't see any reason to believe that we are
attempting to elect these delegates in any kind of closed fashion.''
   House Democrats, meanwhile, were holding 12 regional meetings on
Tuesday and today to nominate 153 of their members. Another 51
could be nominated individually by the end of today.
   Those meetings, too, were held behind closed doors.
   ``I just don't know by what authority it is closed,'' said Mark
McBurney, a spokesman for the House Democrats.
   The House nominees will be considered at a House Democratic
Caucus meeting next week.
   The super delegates, who include members of the Democratic
National Committee, governors and other current or former party
leaders, do not have to pledge their support to any presidential
candidate or declare themselves uncommitted as a condition of
becoming a delegate.
   The other 3,517 delegates to the convention do have to make such
a declaration and were being picked through the series of primaries
and caucuses across the country and overseas.

   Tipper Gore, wife of Democratic
presidential hopeful Albert Gore Jr., said that the two kissed on
their first date when she was 16 and he was 17.
   ``Absolutely!'' declared the Tennessee senator's wife when asked
Tuesday, during an interview with WVOX-WRTN radio, whether she and
her husband-to-be kissed their first time out together.
   Is he a good kisser?
   ``Well, take a look at our family and draw your own
conclusion,'' the mother of four said from her Washington home.
   Tipper Gore may be best known for her campaign against obscene
and violent lyrics in rock music. She is co-founder of the Parents'
Music Resource Center and author of ``Raising PG kids in an X-Rated
Society.''
   Mrs. Gore said she met her future husband at his high school
graduation party 23 years ago. ``We both had dates with different
people,'' she said. ``He called me the next day and we made a date
for the following weekend and we've been together ever since.''
   The two were married five years later, in 1970, after she
graduated from Boston University and he from Harvard.

   The Oklahoma Republican Party is expected
to elect 18 national convention delegates _ all pledged to Vice
President George Bush _ when the state convention is held Saturday
in Oklahoma City.
   Those 18 will join the 18 selected in district meetings last
month. All 36 delegates were committed to candidates based on votes
in the March 8 Super Tuesday presidential primary.
   Bush received 33 of the 36 delegate votes alloted to Oklahoma
Republicans at the national convention in New Orleans in August.
   State GOP chairman Tom Cole said in a news release that the
state convention also will elect new national committee

   Primary elections and caucuses in other
states have narrowed the Democratic presidential field, but have
produced no detectable bandwagon effects among Ohio ``super
delegates'' to the party's national convention.
   A survey showed Tuesday that of the 15 Ohio Democrats assured of
being convention delegates, six remained in support of choices
announced earlier and the others were still undecided. Three could
not be reached, including one delegate who has been out of touch
with the state party for many months.
   In the last AP poll of Ohio super delegates March 4, there were
two votes each for Jesse Jackson and Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, while Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Sen. Albert Gore of
Tennessee had one each.
   Ohio will send between 180-190 delegates to the Democratic
convention in Atlanta on July 15-18, after an involved process that
includes the May 3 primary, in which 104 delegates will be elected
from Ohio's 21 congressional districts.
   Fifty-three will be elected statewide May 3, and an undetermined
number of Ohio's 13 Democratic members of Congress, probably most,
will also be added to the present 15 super delegates.

   Malone responded with a letter to Kennedy Tuesday applauding the

   Hainan Island, China's newest province, will be
granted special economic privileges designed to transform it into
an export powerhouse that generates badly needed foreign currency.
   Foreign businessmen will be welcome to set up companies or joint
ventures, and foreign-funded, high-technology enterprises will be
allowed to sell part of their electronic products on the Chinese
market.
   Hainan will be the first province to issue visas to foreigners
upon arrival, for business and tourism. The visas will last for 15
days and be valid for Hainan only, according to the official
English-language China Daily.
   Hainan, off the southern coast, was made a province and a
special economic zone by the National People's Congress, which
ended an annual session today.
   The island of 6 million people became China's 30th
provincial-level government and will be allowed to keep all its
foreign exchange earnings.
   Already, thousands of young and unemployed are streaming into
the island, creating problems for local officials. Hainan
authorities have now received 150,000 letters from jobseekers, and
say 26,000 people have come to the island in search of work. Only a
tenth of them have received jobs, China Daily said.
   Zeng Peiyan, vice minister of the electronics industry, said his
office is already negotiating with the World Bank to finance
various projects.
   By making these changes, China hopes it can catch up with its
rivals in Asia, and give the four ``economic tigers'' of Singapore,
Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea a run for their money.
   Liang Xiang, head of the Hainan preparatory group, said he has a
formula to make the island a success _ the ``three freedoms'' of
inflow and outflow of capital, import and export of goods, and
entry and exit of foreigners.
   Despite the freedom, there will still be a lot of restrictions.
   ``Our market economy differs from the free economy in Hong Kong
or other capitalist forms of free economy,'' Liang said in a
statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency.
   The state will still control railways, shipping,
telecommunications, banks and other ``economic lifelines.'' In this
way, Liang said ``We shall not deviate from the socialist economic
orbit.''
   There also are doubts over whether China can overcome the
problems standing in the way of making Hainan Island a center of
commerce.
   There is a serious lack of infrastructure. People still work the
land, buildings date from the early decades of the century. Housing
is in short supply, and some peasants live in huts of mud and straw
and go without electricity.
   Travel is difficult, and there are few flights to the region,
previously part of Guangdong province.
   The Chinese say new highways, deep-water ports, railways and
power stations will be built, and that all projects that would be
helpful to the island's economic development will be encouraged.

   Some of the hostages released by the Arab
hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet said they were well treated during
eight days in captivity and did not know their captors had killed
two passengers.
   The hostages were among 12 freed Tuesday in Larnaca, just hours
before the Kuwaiti Airways Boeing 747 left with about 35 other
hostages and six to eight Moslem Shiite hijackers for Algeria,
where the plane landed early today.
   ``We were not beaten. We were not harassed. They treated us very
nicely,'' said Sherif Mahbojh Badrawi said, a Cairo-based ticketing
agent for Kuwait Airways. Badrawi and other passengers spoke to
reporters in Larnaca General Hospital. Like other freed hostages,
he looked tired as he sat on a bed.
   ``I didn't see them harming anyone,'' said Badrawi.
   ``The only time we felt scared was when we went to the bathroom
or wanted a drink because they had pistols pointed at our head
whichever way we went. We were all kept in the center of the
plane.''
   The hijackers killed two Kuwaiti hostages on Saturday and
Monday, dumping their bodies on the Larnaca airport tarmac. The
plane had been at Larnaca for five days.
   Mohammed Kamel Sayyid Rehan, a 32-year-old Egyptian who works as
a caterer for the airline, also said he and his fellow hostages
were treated well.
   He said none of the passengers was aware of the killings.
   Rehan was returning from a three-day holiday in Thailand when
the plane was seized April 5 on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand's
capital, to Kuwait. He asked several times how he could get in
touch with his wife and four children.
   Most of the 12 passengers freed Tuesday wore pajamas as they sat
or lay on beds at the hospital, some with intravenous tubes in
their arms.
   Dr. George Olympios, who examined the 12, said they appeared
healthy.
   ``No one is in a grave condition,'' Olympios said. ``Most are in
good health but are staying for observation; nothing serious apart
from fatigue.''
   ``There were marks on the wrists of most of them,'' apparently
from plastic strips used for binding, he said.
   Badrawi and Rehan said they could not give a precise number of
hijackers, but that all were well armed.
   ``We saw all kinds of arms,'' Badrawi said. ``They had automatic
rifles, grenades, pistols. We always saw them in pairs. I saw six
all together once. They would cover their heads.''
   ``We saw many weapons,'' Rehan said. ``I also saw mines.''
   Saadi Yousef Quttaineh, a 60-year-old Jordanian who lives in
Kuwait with his family of six, said: ``I was relaxed all the time,
except in the beginning I was a bit afraid.
   ``They would move us from one place to another, all together in
a group. We received good treatment. We got enough water and food.''
   Badrawi described the hijackers as ``good Moslems.''
   He said they ``spoke to us in a very Koranic language,'' using
phrases and words common to the Moslem holy book. ``They were
always using verses from the Koran.''

<HEAD>Teacher of the Year Assumes Many Roles To Awaken Young Minds</HEAD>

   School teacher Terry Weeks has donned the garb
of a terrorist to get his seventh-grade students in Murfreesboro,
Tenn., to grapple with viewpoints diametrically opposed to their
own.
   He also has posed as Andrew Jackson and Anwar Sadat to bring
history alive in his classroom.
   On Tuesday, Weeks assumed a new role that he will play for the
next 12 months: the 1988 National Teacher of the Year.
   The 37-year-old social studies instructor from Central Middle
School in Murfreesboro appeared on national television and held a
news conference to kick off a celebratory week that includes a stop
at the White House on Thursday to receive a crystal apple from
President Reagan.
   For Weeks, who makes $25,000 after 15 years in the classroom, it
was a taste of adulation he said he wished all teachers could share.
   ``I wish somehow I could bundle it all up and as I go across the
country this next year, just kind of spread it out to the
teachers,'' he said. ``They need to know that there are news
cameras waiting on the teacher of the year when he gets off of a
plane, people wanting to know how he teaches ... and what is it
that keeps him in the classroom.''
   He also told reporters, ``I can't do the moon walk. I can't slam
dunk a basketball. ... I'm a teacher.''

<HEAD>Jim Brady, Wife Describe Plight Of Head Injury Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential press secretary James Brady and
his wife Sarah are urging Congress to expand home health care and
other services vital to head injury victims, describing vividly
their own plight since Brady was shot.
   ``My name is Jim Brady. I am a 7-year survivor of a traumatic
brain injury,'' Brady said evenly as a hush fell over a packed
Senate hearing room Tuesday. ``I know only too well the tragedy
surrounding a head injury. I am pleased that you are taking a keen
look at our problems.''
   Brady was shot during the 1981 assassination attempt on
President Reagan and at one point was reported dead. He delivered
his brief statement to the Senate Labor and Human Resources
subcommittee on the handicapped from a wheelchair, with little
expression in his face or voice.
   Mrs. Brady said Brady had received first-rate care, even down to
a 24-hour Secret Service guard by his hospital room door.
   The rude shock came when Brady was released from the hospital
and there was no support network, his wife said. She said her
family's No. 1 need is for home care for her husband, who cannot be
left alone during a short shopping trip much less the many hours of
a full-time workday.
   Mrs. Brady said families and survivors also need support and
counseling programs to cope with the tragedy that has shattered so
many lives _ children, parents, spouses and the victims themselves.

<HEAD>HUD Plans More Housing Vouchers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce says federal housing officials plan to significantly
increase the number of people getting vouchers to help pay their
rent.
   The voucher program, the Reagan administration's alternative to
building more public housing, now assists about 100,000 low-income
families, with another 34,000 to be added by the fall, Pierce told
a House Appropriations subcommittee.
   HUD plans to add another 100,000 families in 1989, he said
Tuesday.
   Rather than subsidizing housing units, the program gives poor
families a voucher which can be used to pay a portion of the rent
on living space they choose for themselves. The value of the
voucher is fixed according to each family's income, leaving the
amount of additional rent flexible. The program was made permanent
by Congress last year.
   ``Vouchers give families the dignity of choice, offering them
the opportunity to locate near family and friends, schools,
churches and jobs,'' rather than in public housing projects, said
Pierce. He appeared before the subcommittee on HUD-independent
agencies to discuss his $21.6 billion budget request for fiscal
1989. HUD's 1988 budget is $18.6 billion.
   Pierce said the number of households to be assisted by various
HUD programs would increase from 4.3 million in 1988 to 4.4 million
next year.

<HEAD>BLM Considering Halting Large-Scale Giveaways of Wild Horses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bureau of Land Management says it is going
to decide whether recent allegations of cruelty to animals should
mean an end to its practice of giving away large numbers of wild
horses.
   ``We're putting the large-scale adoptions under an intensive
review,'' BLM spokesman Tim Locke said Tuesday. But he declined to
confirm a report that the no-fee, large-herd ``adoption'' program
had been suspended.
   Since the mid-1970s, the bureau has offered for ``adoption'' the
wild horses taken in its roundups from the Western range on payment
of $125.
   Use of the term ``adoption'' is really a marketing tool, since
after a year the bureau gives the ``foster parent'' title to the
horse.
   Since 1984 the bureau has waived the fee for people willing to
take 100 animals or more.
   Locke said the review was prompted by recent allegations of
abuse, including one at Sheyenne, N.D., where earlier this month
bureau officials reclaimed what was left of a herd of 400 horses on
a ranch there.
   The Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald last week quoted John Boyles, head
of the bureau's wild horse and burro division, as saying, ``We're
not approving any more than those already approved.''
   Both Boyles and Robert Burford, director of the bureau, were
traveling Tuesday and unavailable for comment. Locke would say
only, ``The instruction memo has not been issued. Large-scale
adoptions are still in our regs.''

<TEXT>
   About 260 Marines flew to Panama this morning
and more scheduled to leave tonight for jungle training in the
troubled country, officials said.
   The Marines flew out on a chartered Air America airliner at
about 10 p.m. Tuesday from Miramar Naval Air Station, said Gunnery
Sgt. Stan Pederson, a spokesman at Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base
about 60 miles north of San Diego.
   He said 240 other members of the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marine
Regiment, and the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, will leave
about 7 p.m. from Miramar.
   The departures are unrelated to the U.S. military buildup
prompted by Panama's political turmoil, Pederson said.
   The Marines will join about 300 other members of their
battalions who left Friday for a three-week course at the Army's
jungle operations training center at Fort Sherman, about 50 miles
from Panama City, he said.
   ``I'm sure that they're aware what's happening down there,''
Pederson said. ``We're going to concentrate on training down there
and be back first of May.''
   On Monday, a 25-year-old Marine at a U.S. Air Force base in
Panama City was mistakenly shot to death by fellow Marine guards
while investigating a suspected break-in at the base.
   About 1,300 additional U.S. servicemen were sent to Howard Air
Force Base outside Panama City last week to provide greater
security for the Panama Canal, American installations and U.S.
citizens.
   The United States is backing deposed President Eric Arturo
Delvalle in his attempt to oust Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who was indicted in the United States on drug
trafficking charges.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at
an all-time high for the third consecutive trading day today, while
the dollar eased back in trading against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
5.97 points Tuesday, added another 54.71 points, or 0.2 percent,
and finished the day at 26,985.55.
   ``The market is keeping the upward trend, led by electricals and
large-capital issues such as steels,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama of
Nikko Securities.
   He said a Japanese news report that the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry plans to increase voltage of
electricity for home use from the current 100 volts to 200 volts by
1995 to meet an increasing demand for large-capacity home
appliances boosted the popularity of electrical issues.
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's major economic daily, reported
today that MITI will talk with electrical firms on increasing
electricity voltage.
   Increased voltage may lead to swifter sales of large washing
machines, refrigerators and other appliances, and investors saw the
news as reason to buy shares in electricals, traders said.
   Shimoyama added that a strong showing on Wall Street overnight
and the dollar's stability also boosted the Tokyo market.
   In New York, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed
Tuesday at 2,110.08. It was the first time since the market
collapsed last October that the index went above the 2,100-mark.
   Prominent among gainers were steels, shipbuildings and
electricals. Drugs and oils were also firm. Losers included weak
electricals and pulps.
   Volume of the first-section trade was a heavy 1 billion shares
against 750 million shares Tuesday.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
126.45 yen, down 0.05 yen from its close of 126.50 yen Tuesday. It
had opened the day at 126.90 yen and ranged between 126.43-126.97
yen.
   There was no notable movement in the market and the dollar
remained stable ahead of the completion of the meeting of seven
major monetary nations in Washington and the release of U.S. trade
figures for February, according to Yuichi Sawa of the Bank of Tokyo.

   A British-registered tanker was
delivering crude oil offshore when its boiler room exploded,
killing four crew members and injuring four others, authorities
said.
   The Coast Guard said the cause of Tuesday afternoon's explosion
aboard the 865-foot Argo Iduna was under investigation. At the
time, the vessel was about 75 miles southeast of Galveston.
   The four injured crewman were airlifted by two Coast Guard
helicopters for treatment at John Sealy Hospital in Galveston,
where they arrived Tuesday night, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Anthony Rodrigues, 28, and J.R. Yadav, 29, suffered superficial
burns and were treated and released Tuesday night, said hospital
spokeswoman Leeann Teymour. Remesh Chend, 30, was in fair condition
with burns; Ratesh Kumar, 29, was in good condition with a rib
injury, she said.
   The tanker, with the four dead crewmen aboard, remained at sea
early today, tied up to another tanker providing it electrical
power while towing was arranged. The names of the dead were not
available, the Coast Guard said.
   The explosion occurred as the vessel transferred a load of crude
oil to smaller ships for transport to shore, said Coast Guard Lt.
Bob Carson in New Orleans.
   ``As far as we know, the vessel is still seaworthy, it is
floating,'' said Petty Officer 2nd Class Ron Mench. ``Of course, it
has no power, they expect it to be towed by civilian tugs.''
   The ship was of British registry and its home port was Hong
Kong, he said.

<HEAD>Five Killed in Car-Train Collisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven hours after Amtrak train No. 392 began its
run, five people were dead, killed in two separate grade crossing
accidents that an Amtrak official says the train crew could not
have prevented.
   ``They were powerless to avoid the accidents, and no
disciplinary action is planned,'' Debbie Marciniak, an Amtrak
spokeswoman, said Tuesday after the accidents 150 miles and 3{
hours apart.
   That does not make the deaths of a young couple and two of their
children, then later of a 20-year-old woman any easier on the
crewmen who made the 300-mile Carbondale-to-Chicago run Tuesday.
   ``You don't forget things like this. ... You get the shakes,''
said engineer T.B. Parker, whose fireman was at the throttle late
Monday when the first accident occurred, killing the young couple
and the children.
   The victims were identified as Cecil Ray Chandler, 26, of La
Clede, in south Illinois; his wife, Brenda, 25; their 4-year-old
daughter, Kerry; and their 3-year-old son, Carl, police said.
   Parker said he and his partner, fireman William White, 55, saw
the Chandler car on Illinois 37 near Effingham about 90 minutes
into the run.
   ``The car made a right turn and kept on going at a slow rate of
speed'' across the track about 60 feet from the highway, Parker
said.
   ``I could see the female occupant of the car, and she never
looked at us. ... I thought I saw the woman holding a child.
   ``Mr. White had already applied the brakes,'' Parker said. ``He
started blowing the whistle. Then we put the brakes in emergency,
but it was too late.''
   He said the engine had been traveling about 76 mph, a speed Ms.
Marciniak said was within the maximum allowed for that area.
   The train was delayed about an hour and then headed north from
Kankakee, traveling at the maximum 79 mph, Parker said.
   ``As we were moving on, we saw a car approaching rapidly from
the west,'' he said. ``The crossing signals were working, the gates
were down, and we were blowing the whistle.''
   The driver allegedly skirted the horizontal warning gates and
struck the train's front wheels, causing what Parker described as
``a minor jolt'' that destroyed the vehicle and killed Annette
Hanshew, 20, who lived near Bourbonnais, authorities said.
   Ms. Marciniak said the crossing in the first accident had a
warning sign and the second had crossing gates. She said the
Federal Railroad Administration had contacted Amtrak about the
accidents.
   The Illinois Commerce Commission said it could find no
obstructions or other factors that caused the first accident.
   ``It is sort of puzzling from our standpoint,'' said Dan Drewes,
the agency's assistant chief engineer in Springfield.
   One of two tracks on the solid timber crossing needs repair but
isn't believed to be a factor, Drewes said.
   Parker said he doesn't believe the Chandler family saw the train
at the crossing, marked with a crossing symbol but with no gate or
lights.
   The family moved to Illinois from Mount Airy, N.C., said Ronald
Pagel, owner of Pagel Funeral Home in Edgewood. Chandler, a former
saw-mill worker, was unemployed, he said, adding the couple had
three other children.
   Last year, Illinois ranked second nationally with 481 accidents
at rail crossings, Ms. Marciniak said. Texas was first with 625.

<HEAD>FCC Promises Station Owners Relief from `Sham' License Challenges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission
wants to protect radio and TV station owners from frivolous license
challenges that the agency's chief says make running a station ``a
kind of Russian roulette.''
   Some of the commission's license renewal policies result in
``nothing short of extortion'' that is costly for station owners,
FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said Tuesday in a speech to the
National Association of Broadcasters convention.
   ``I'm know you'll agree that running your business as a kind of
Russian roulette cannot help but disserve the public interest,''
Patrick said on the closing day of the convention.
   At license renewal time, a station owner can face challenges by
groups that want to compete for the license to use that station's
frequency. Radio licenses must be renewed every seven years and TV
licenses every five years.
   Challengers can easily structure an application that looks
better than the record of the existing station because they do not
have to prove they have the necessary financial and technical
qualifications to run a station, Patrick said.
   Existing procedures give preference to certain applicants, such
as those who are female, minority and from the local community. The
FCC has been concerned that existing procedures make it easy for
``sham'' applications _ those filed by groups that have recruited
someone who fits the preference criteria so they will have an edge
in the competition for the station license.
   Renewal challenges often are settled by a station owner making a
financial payment to competing applicants, he said.
   ``Petitions to deny are a useful and statutory part of the
process where they identify bona fide problems,'' Patrick said.
``But where they are filed in a bad faith attempt to extract money
or concessions unrelated to any legitimate public interest
concerns, they are nothing short of extortion and it has to stop.''
   He mentioned specifically the case of WBBM-TV in Chicago, which
currently is facing challenges to its license renewal. ``The
proceeding may put some Washington lawyers' kids through college,
but I can think of other uses for the money that would be more
beneficial to audiences in Chicago,'' Patrick said.
   The chairman said the FCC can take some actions to change
policies governing the process without need for congressional
action.
   He said the commission will formulate policies that would give
``station owners who perform acceptably a reasonable expectation of
renewal,'' while ensuring that bona fide applicants can still mount
a challenge.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers at the racketeering trial of
Rep. Mario Biaggi may have thrown a prosecution witness's entire
testimony into doubt after getting her to admit she lied under oath.
   Near the end of her testimony Tuesday, the defense had former
Wedtech Corp. bookkeepper Celia Lewis admit on the witness stand
that she had previously lied about meeting with prosecutors.
   Mrs. Lewis denied speaking with government lawyers three times
before she was forced to own up after a prosecutor spoke with the
judge.
   ``You deliberately lied a few minutes ago, didn't you, when you
said you had not met with the prosecutors?'' defense attorney
Jeffrey Glekel asked.
   ``Yes, I did,'' she replied.
   The admission came after Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Shannon
informed the judge, first in private, and then in open court, that
she had met with Mrs. Lewis for about 90 minutes on Monday evening
and for 45 minutes Tuesday morning.
   ``The government has a duty,'' U.S. District Judge Constance
Baker Motley told the jury ``to advise the court whenever a witness
has said something which is not true which the government knows is
not true.''
   Although both sides declined to comment on the disclosure,
citing a gag order banning discussion of the case with reporters,
defense lawyers were visibly jubilant as they left the courtroom
during a recess.
   There was no allegation of wrongdoing by prosecutors who are
allowed to speak with government witnesses before and after their
testimony unless they are being cross-examined by the defense.
   Cross examination of Mrs. Lewis was completed Monday afternoon,
followed by re-direct questioning by the prosecution.
   Biaggi, D-N.Y.; his former law partner, Bernard Ehrlich; Wedtech
founder John Mariotta and four others are accused of turning the
now-bankrupt defense contractor into a racketeering enterprise that
paid bribes in return for government contracts.
   Mrs. Lewis, who began her testimony last week, has directly
linked Mariotta to a $5 million slush fund she supervised for
Wedtech officials.
   Mrs. Lewis, testifying with full immunity from the government,
also previously has topld the court she kept track of $50,000 in
payoffs Wedtech officials allegedly gave former Bronx Borough
President Stanley Simon, another defendant.
   In later testimony, a lawyer who once worked in Biaggi's law
firm said its political connections were what got the firm hired by
Wedtech.
   ``They were paid for political connections,'' said Carlos
Cuevas, a former associate at the law firm of Biaggi & Ehrlich.

<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan today
resigned all his public and political posts to accept
responsibility for his brother's role in a massive corruption
scandal.
   Chun, looking tired and strained, told a news conference he was
resigning as chairman of the Advisory Council of State Elders and
as honorary president of the governing Democratic Justice Party.
   The former president said he was giving up the offices because
he failed to prevent his brother's embezzling a fortune in cash,
land and stocks through government contacts. He said his brother
should be judged sternly.
   ``I cannot but keenly feel that it was due entirely to my own
incompetence and lack of discretion that I have failed to control
and supervise my younger brother,'' Chun said.
   Chun Doo-hwan's resignation leaves him without any official
positions and appears to signal his departure from politics. As
president of the advisory council, he served as a principal adviser
to the president.
   Chun's brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, is awaiting trial on charges of
embezzlement, influence peddling and extortion while he was head of
the semi-official Saemaul Undong, or New Community, development
movement.
   The younger Chun was named to the post in 1981, while his
brother was president, and resigned last year. The movement
oversees rural and urban development projects.
   Government prosecutors say they have evidence that millions of
dollars was stolen by the younger Chun and his associates to build
a private empire that operated under official protection.
   Some government officials are being investigated on suspicion
they covered up protection to protect the president's family. The
former president has not been implicated in the corruption probe.
   ``I cannot refrain from being sorry that my foolish younger
brother has committed scandalous acts and caused uneasiness of
heart among the people,'' the former president told reporters.
   Opposition parties demanded the elder Chun cooperate with the
probe into Saemaul and prove he was not involved in the scandal.
   The opposition Party for Peace and Democracy, which has charged
the former president was involved in corruption, demands he prove
he was not involved in spiriting funds overseas.
   The opposition hopes to make the Saemaul revelations a major
issue in the April 26 National Assembly elections to embarrass the
governing Democratic Justice Party.
   President Roh Tae-woo, who succeeded Chun Feb. 25, is thought to
have sanctioned the corruption probe to discredit his predecessor
and undermine Chun's attempts to retain power. The former president
reportedly wanted to use his advisory position to wield influence
behind the scenes.
   Roh, a former general, helped put fellow general Chun in power
with military backing in 1980. But Roh promised during last year's
presidential campaign to investigate allegations of widespread
corruption under the Chun administration.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chief
spokesman said he's ``amused and annoyed'' about Larry Speakes'
admission that the former White House spokesman attributed
fabricated quotes to President Reagan.
   ``I don't think it is the proper way to do the job, to put words
into anybody's mouth, especially your boss' mouth,'' Gennady
Gerasimov said at a news conference Tuesday.
   ``I'm not going to this. I think if I do this I will be
discovered and fired.''
   He referred to the admission by Speakes in his memoirs that he
twice attributed to Reagan statements the president did not make.
   Gerasimov speculated that the quotes were made up, including one
during a 1985 summit meeting between Reagan and Gorbachev in
Geneva, because, ``President Reagan is not always talkative.''
   ``I'm not offended. I'm amused and annoyed,'' Gerasimov said.
   ``Many strange things happen in this country that are discovered
afterward,'' he said when asked how serious he thought Speakes'
actions were. ``It's just another thing that has happened that
makes your life so interesting.''
   Gerasimov was in Boston to participate in a two-day conference
on ``Global Information: The Invisible Reshaping of Our World,'' in
connection with the 10th anniversary of WorldPaper, a journal based
in Boston and circulated in 24 countries.
   Gerasimov also predicted there will be a civil war in
Afghanistan if both sides do not accept the reconciliation program
program proposed by the Soviet-backed government.
   ``It's up to them now. We did what we could,'' he said, adding
that Moscow ``will think twice, thrice again,'' before getting
involved in such a war. ``A situation like this is not going to
happen again,'' he said.

   Spearheads uncovered in an apple
orchard here and a human skull fragment found in Kansas date back
more than 10,000 years and could be evidence of the first humans to
walk the continent, scientists say.
   Two workers installing underground sprinklers at R&R Orchards
last May stumbled upon stone spear points that could be 11,000
years old, said C. Vance Haynes, a University of Arizona professor
of anthropology and geology.
   ``This is probably one of the most exciting finds that's
occurred in many, many decades,'' Haynes said Tuesday. ``There is a
possibility these were the first people into the New World.''
   Artifacts uncovered so far in this central Washington town
include stone tools, projectile points and bone implements. No
human remains have been found since formal excavation began Monday,
scientists say.
   However, a human skull fragment discovered in Kansas was
recently shown by new dating techniques to be about 15,400 years
old, reported Larry Martin, a systematics and ecology professor at
the University of Kansas.
   The skull fragment, found in 1975, was dated using electron spin
resonance, which involves measuring the density of trapped
electrons that accumulate in bone as a result of environmental
radiation after the material is buried.
   The fragment likely ``has a real shot at being one of the oldest
Americans,'' Martin, curator of the university's Museum of Natural
History, said last week.
   Haynes, however, said resonance is a ``much newer and less
tried'' method than the Carbon-14 dating usually used in dating
archaeological discoveries. He said he was unaware of the Kansas
discovery and was reluctant to compare the two finds.
   The Washington artifacts have not been scientifically dated, say
archaeologists on the excavation team, which includes
representatives of Washington State University, the University of
Wyoming and the Smithsonian Institution.
   The orchard workers initially unearthed about 20 stone pieces,
and an additional seven were found by archaeologists on Monday.
Many are so-called Clovis points, named after a New Mexico site
where such stone tools were initially discovered in the 1920s and
1930s.
   The points would have been used on the end of spears to stab
mammals like elephants, horses and bison, said Peter Mehringer of
Washington State and director of the excavation project.
   He, too, contended the find indicates people at least as old as
any previously discovered in North America, although finds on other
continents may be as old as 40,000 years.
   ``Clovis is the oldest (North American) culture for which we
have duplicated evidence,'' Haynes said. Archaeologists on the
scene said all previous Clovis finds have been scientifically dated
to about 11,000 years ago.
   Richard Daugherty, a retired WSU professor involved in the
digging, said the Clovis points _ which are fashioned from chipped
rock _ are unique in their number and their size.
   Some are more than 8 inches long and are brown and cream in
color.
   ``This is the largest cache of Clovis points ever found,'' said
Dennis Stanford of the Smithsonian Institution. ``Something real
interesting was going on here that we can't explain. The points are
about twice the size they should be.''
   Daugherty said scientists are not sure why they would be so big,
although Haynes said the size could indicate ceremonial use.

   A fire at the Wharncliffe Volunteer
Fire Department engulfed the building before firefighters could get
their fire truck out, officials say.
   ``I was just devastated,'' said Fire Chief James Dotson.
   Dotson said he arrived at the firehouse early Tuesday to find a
storage building connected to the station engulfed in flames.
   The firehouse was still intact, and Dotson opened the station
door, intending to move the engine. But the heat was so intense it
drove him back. His protective gear was of no use because it was
inside the station, too.
   Firefighters from nearby Gilbert were called to Wharncliffe when
the blaze was reported, but it took them more than 30 minutes to
negotiate the 13 miles of winding mountain roads between the towns.
   By then, the station's ceiling had fallen in, and the front wall
of the second floor fell in just as firefighters got into position.
   ``There was no chance of saving either the truck nor any of the
equipment,'' said Kendell Simpson, Gilbert's assistant fire chief.
   ``I just could have cried,'' said Hazel Toler, a dispatcher in
Gilbert who said she saw the fire as she drove to work.
   The fire probably was caused by old wiring, authorities said.
   Wharncliffe's fire truck and $50,000 worth of equipment were
destroyed, officials said. No one was in the building when the fire
began and no one was injured.
   Firefighters managed to save a 1958 2,000-gallon tanker that was
being repaired, Dotson said.
   Simpson said Gilbert's fire department will cover Wharncliffe
until it returns to operation, expected within a week.

<HEAD>Flooding Threatens Atlantic Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong, easterly winds threatened to cause flooding today along
the central Atlantic Coast after a surprise spring snowstorm
dropped as much as 9 inches of snow in North Carolina and Georgia.
   Gale warnings were up along the central Atlantic Coast this
morning.
   The snowstorm Tuesday skipped through mountainous, northeast
Georgia and western North Carolina, leaving snow in some places but
only rain in others while triggering numerous accidents.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Macon County, N.C., dispatcher Troy
Gregory. ``I bet I've answered this phone 10,000 times already. ...
There are accidents everywhere. But there's nothing right here in
town.''
   ``All of our major routes are blocked, either by power lines,
trees or jackknifed tractor-trailers,'' said Avery County, N.C.,
dispatcher Larry Sudderth. ``The phones have just been ringing off
the hook.''
   No injuries were reported.
   About 4 inches of snow fell in Boone, N.C., while Grandfather
Mountain got 6 inches and Flat Top Mountain got 9.
   Today, rain showers and thunderstorms extended from North
Carolina and eastern South Carolina to Virginia. Skies were cloudy
from West Virginia to the eastern Gulf Coast states and clear or
partly cloudy over the rest of the nation.
   Today's forecast called for widely scattered rain showers in
southwest California and along the central Atlantic Coast, and
strong, gusty winds in the central Rockies.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s across much of the
nation, the 40s and 50s from New England and New Jersey to the
upper Appalachians, Upper Michigan, Minnesota and North Dakota; the
80s in much of Texas, the southern two-thirds of New Mexico,
southern Arizona and inland Southern California and near 90 degrees
in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 23
degrees at Houlton, Maine, to 85 degrees at Blythe, Calif.

<HEAD>Militants Open Fire Inside Holy Shrine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh militants today fired into the air
with automatic rifles and other weapons inside Sikhism's holiest
shrine.
   There were no reports of injuries from the shooting, which
occurred at the Golden Temple during a religious holiday for the
minority faith.
   Police said the 15-minute burst of gunfire panicked devotees
trying to visit the temple for Baisakhi, the anniversary of Guru
Gobind Singh's introduction of the so-called baptism by sword for
Sikhs in 1699.
   The new evidence of militants keeping weapons inside the shrine
came as tensions were increasing over the Sikh radicals' demand for
an independent nation they call Khalistan, or ``land of the pure''
in the Punjabi language.
   Police also said for the first time that the militants were
building fortifications inside the temple complex and chipping
gun-holes into walls, apparently to prevent police or soldiers from
entering the shrine.
   In June 1984, the Indian army carried out a massive raid to
drive militants from the Golden Temple and more than 1,200 people
were killed, including Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a militant Sikh
preacher. Five months later Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was
assassinated by two Sikh bodguards in revenge for the raid, setting
off anti-Sikh rioting in which 2,000 people died.
   Police say Sikh separatists who have been fighting a guerrilla
war for five years for an independent homeland in Punjab often take
refuge in the temple.
   The United News of India reported at least 18 deaths in the last
24 hours in Punjab as Sikh radicals kept up attacks to press their
separatist demands. More than 700 people have been killed this year
in the northern state in attacks blamed on the radicals.
   Izhar Alam, Amritsar's police superintendent, said it was not
known why the militants fired inside the temple today, except to
mark the holiday.
   He said the militants also raised flags of Khalistan atop
several buildings in the complex, including the Akal Takht, the
so-called ``throne of immortals'' where the temple's chief priest
sits.
   Witnesses said 400 to 500 devotees visited the temple today,
compared with more than 20,000 who used to come for the holiday in
more peaceful times.
   Baisakhi marks the day when, at a meeting of the Sikh masses,
the 10th and final Sikh guru called for five men to come forward
and sacrifice their lives for the faith. One by one they entered a
tent and screams were heard.
   In the end, Guru Gobind Singh presented the five men to the
crowd, all alive, and called on Sikhs to become soldiers of their
faith. He decreed Sikhs would carry swords, introducing militancy
to the erstwhile pacifist faith.
   The low turnout at the temple today may have been due to fears
of trouble and the fact that a chief Sikh priest, Jasbir Singh
Rode, called a meeting of all Sikh organizations the same day at a
seminary in southern Punjab.
   Sikh radicals maintain a separate nation is needed to keep their
minority sect from being overwhelmed by Hindus, who are more than
80 percent of India's 780 million people. Sikhs make up 2 percent
of the country's population, but they are a majority in Punjab.
They allege discrimination by Hindus.

   The U.S. dollar rose in thin European trading
today on market hopes that better American trade figures will be
released Thursday, foreign currency dealers said. Gold prices fell.
   The dollar was supported by speculation that the February U.S.
trade deficit has shrunk from January's gap of $12.4 billion,
dealers said.
   Some economists predicted a deficit of $11.2 billion and one
Frankfurt dealer said there were rumors it may even have fallen
below $10 billion.
   The trade speculation was overshadowing today's meeting in
Washington of finance ministers from the Group of Seven
industrialized countries, dealers said.
   Finance ministers from the United States, Britain, Canada,
Japan, France, West Germany and Italy are expected to discuss the
dollar and reaffirm last year's agreement on economic-policy
cooperation and the stabilization of exchange rates.
   ``The G-7 is under no great immediate pressure to come up with
new policy initiatives right now, so the usual comforting joint
statement is probable,'' said one dealer in Milan, Italy.
   A Munich dealer said ``only the trade figures are really
important.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar dipped 0.05 yen to a closing of 126.45 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 126.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6922 West German marks, up from 1.6853
   _1.4007 Swiss francs, up from 1.3967
   _5.7390 French francs, up from 5.7165
   _1.8968 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8890
   _1,254.25 Italian lire, up from 1,249.75
   _1.2360 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2370
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8450, cheaper for buyers
than late Tuesday's $1.8515.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $449.30 a troy ounce,
down from late Tuesday's $451. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $448.50.
   One London dealer said gold was pushed below its recent support
level of $450 by some mild selling during Asian trading.
   But he said European trading was very light and he expected
little movement throughout the day as the bullion market watched
the G-7 meetings in Washington.
   In Zurich, gold's bid price was $448.50 an ounce, down from $451
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.39 to close at a bid $450.82.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.37 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.45.

<HEAD>Entertainer-Restaurateur Easily Elected Mayor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sonny Bono, who easily won the
mayor's office of this desert resort, says his fame as Cher's
ex-husband and former singing partner was both an asset and a
handicap during his campaign.
   ``I think the celebrity status got me a lot of name
identification,'' Bono, 53, said after Tuesday's victory, but said
it was hard to overcome his image as ``a straight man for Cher'' _
who won her first Academy Award the night before.
   ``At first, he was viewed as a joke. But then he got out and
started talking to folks and became a legitimate and very popular
candidate,'' said Rebecca Kurtz, managing editor of Palm Springs
Life magazine.
   Bono, a restaurateur and the state's newest celebrity mayor, won
by almost a 2-1 margin, with 4,842 votes to 2,498 for accountant
Lloyd Maryanov, his closest competitor in the field of seven, city
officials said.
   In coastal Carmel, where actor Clint Eastwood decided against a
second, two-year term as mayor, voters elected community activist
Jean Grace to succeed him. Grace, who received Eastwood's
endorsement, got 1,144 votes. Her chief challenger, Clayton
Anderson, got 868 votes.
   In the race for the state Assembly seat vacated by San Francisco
Mayor Art Agnos, former U.S. Rep. John Burton won with 20,550
votes, or 52.2 percent, to 14,341 votes, or 36.5 percent, for gay
activist lawyer Roberta Achtenberg, 37.
   Burton, 55, held the seat between 1965 and 1975, then
represented the city in Congress until 1982, when he left office to
treat a cocaine addiction. He and Achtenberg are on the June
primary ballot for the 1988-90 term of the seat.
   Bono, who moved to the desert resort city 110 miles east of Los
Angeles four years ago, got 44 percent of the vote and Maryanov got
23 percent, with a voter turnout estimated at 55 percent, said
Assistant City Clerk Patty Bode.
   Bono will serve a four-year term with an annual salary of
$15,000. During his campaign, he said he would draw tourists back
through carefully planned events including a film festival and
concerts.
   Bono rose to fame with Cher, singing such songs as ``I've Got
You Babe'' and ``The Beat Goes On.'' Cher went on to a Hollywood
career, and on Monday won the best actress Oscar for her role in
``Moonstruck.''
   Bono and his fourth wife, Mary, 26, are expecting their first
child this week.

<HEAD>Frank Robinson Named Manager of Orioles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, major league
baseball's first black manager, took the helm of a team for the
third time when he was named to replace Cal Ripken of the Baltimore
Orioles.
   Ripken was fired as manager after the Orioles lost their first
six games of the season in their worst start in 33 years. Baltimore
finished the last season with 67 wins and 95 losses.
   Robinson on Tuesday became the major leagues' first black
manager since he was fired from the San Francisco Giants in 1984.
   ``I don't think I ever felt the pressure of being in the
position of being a black manager,'' he said at a news conference.
``I am aware of the pressure of the position, but I don't let it
bother me.''
   In 1974, he became the first black major league manager ever
when he took over the Cleveland Indians. He held that post until
1977, and was made the Giants' manager in 1981.
   Only two other blacks have managed in the major leagues: Larry
Doby with the Chicago White Sox in 1978 and Maury Wills at Seattle
in 1980-81.
   Robinson has spent 13 years with the Orioles' organization, as
player, coach or in the front office, and was a special assistant
to the president when named manager.
   An outfielder, he was elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1982.
   Ripken, who succeeded Earl Weaver as manager after the 1986
season, was the first man ever to manage two sons _ Cal Ripken Jr.
and Billy _ simultaneously in major league baseball.
   Ripken was offered a position as special assistant to General
Manager Roland Hemond. He said he had not made up his mind about
taking it.

<HEAD>Soviets Line Up to Buy American-Style Pizza</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until now, the pizza sold in Moscow only vaguely
resembled the American-style pie.
   It usually consisted of a thick, doughy crust smeared with
tomato paste. Toppings, when available, included canned, cold
tomatoes, sardines, chopped egg or lumps of salt pork.
   So it was no surprise when a crowd of Muscovites lined up in
Lenin Hills on Tuesday for pizza from a specially equipped van that
is part of a joint economic venture involving a New Jersey company.
   Nearly 1,200 slices, costing $2.10 each, were dispensed by the
mobile pizzeria a three-hour period by midafternoon. Workers
couldn't say exactly how many slices were sold because some were
given away.
   ``The reaction is extraordinary,'' said Louis Piancone,
president of Roma Food Enterprises in Piscataway, N.J., at the
van's first day of operation in Moscow. ``We'll be moving through
the city to determine what the market is for opening pizza
restaurants. Judging from today at just this location, there's a
market.''
   A new law allowing Soviet firms to enter into joint ventures
with foreign companies is one of the steps taken by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to raise productivity and provide sorely needed consumer
goods and services.
   Many Western entrepreneurs have been wary, however, saying the
rules require the joint firm's director to be a Soviet, that
hirings and firings must conform to Soviet law, and that the
venture can compete with its Western parent abroad.
   Since the law went into effect, joint ventures have been signed
involving coal, paint and fertilizer production. Pepsico Inc. last
fall signed a contract to have two Pizza Hut restaurants in Moscow,
but they have not yet opened.
   ``We thought this was a great opportunity. We thought we'd get
the Yankee spirit and come here and open this,'' said Piancone's
U.S. partner, Shelley M. Zeiger, standing in front of lettering on
the van proclaiming the ``First American Pizza in Moscow.''
   Zeiger said they intend to open as many as 25 pizza restaurants
around Moscow if the Soviet government approves and demand is
sufficient.
   Only tomato and cheese slices were sold Tuesday, but Piancone
said 20 toppings, including meat, would be sold starting today.
   He said ingredients from the United States are being used now,
but company officials hope to use some Soviet ingredients
eventually.
   ``This is part of the spirit of the joint venture,'' Zeiger
said. ``We hope to work with the Soviet agricultural people so we
can get tomatoes with just the right acidity for our recipes. And
the cheese _ we want to buy Soviet cheese, but it has to have the
right fat content.''
   He said pizza will be sold for foreign currency in a few weeks,
but only when the van is parked near hotels and areas that
frequented by tourists. Depending on its location, the van will
sell pizza for either rubles or foreign currency, but not for both
in the same day.
   Zeiger, who operates a Trenton, N.J., real estate and import
firm, said 51 percent of the profits go to his Soviet partners and
the remainder to the New Jersey company.

   Ann Jillian made nearly 2,000 people laugh
and cry as she revealed how she fought and won her struggle with
breast cancer.
   The 38-year-old actress was in Decatur on Tuesday, the third
anniversary of her double mastectomy, to share her story and
emphasize the need for early detection through self-examination and
mammography. Her visit was sponsored by St. Mary's Hospital.
   She recounted the details of her own illness, explaining that
she took the second opinion of a doctor and did not have a biopsy
immediately after finding the first lump.
   ``His advice was exactly what I wanted to hear,'' Ms. Jillian
said. ``I was doing an awful lot of work and it never occurred to
me I might have breast cancer.'' She discovered a lump in the other
breast, but chose not to alarm her husband until she was sure if it
was cancer.
   ``May I tell,'' she said. ``Please involve that one significant
other. To have them come in as `Johnny come lately' is not good.''
   Ms. Jillian's husband, former Chicago policeman Andy Murcia, sat
on stage as she spoke.
   The actress returned to work 11 days after having both breasts
removed. She continued working despite chemotherapy that made her
gain weight and lose her hair.

   Defense attorneys for Abbas
Hamadi asked a federal court to acquit the Lebanese man charged in
the kidnappings of two West Germans in Beirut.
   In a surprise announcement Tuesday, a Frankfurt state court said
Hamadi's brother, Mohammed Hamadi, will be tried in a juvenile
court.
   That decision means Mohammed Hamadi, charged with murder and air
piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jet, faces a maximum 10-year
prison sentence if convicted. An adult court could sentence him to
a possible life term upon conviction.
   Abbas Hamadi is accused of kidnapping two West Germans in
Lebanon in January 1987 allegedly to force West Germany to free his
brother.
   ``I had no direct or indirect involvement in the kidnappings,''
Abbas Hamadi told the five-judge panel Tuesday after his attorneys
concluded their final arguments.
   Earlier, defense counsel Ludwig Hoeller told the court that his
client did not contest charges of possessing explosives. He
recommended that Hamadi be sentenced to one year in prison but
added that Hamadi should be released immediately because already he
has served more than a year in investigative custody.
   Prosecutors last week asked for a prison sentence of 11{ years
on kidnapping, coercion and explosives charges.
   A verdict is expected next week.
   Hamadi is charged with kidnapping West German businessmen Rudolf
Cordes and Alfred Schmidt in Beirut in 1987.
   Cordes was seized at Beirut Airport on Jan. 17, 1987 and Schmidt
was abducted from his Beirut hotel room three days later. Schmidt
was released last September in what his captors called a ``goodwill
gesture,'' while Cordes remains in captivity.
   ``Much of the evidence against my client is based on testimony
from witnesses of dubious credibility, on hearsay, and on
interrogations that were conducted improperly,'' chief defense
counsel Eckart Hild Hild said earlier Tuesday.
   Federal Prosecutor Karl-Heinz Schnarr said evidence, including
wiretaps and fingerprints, proved conclusively that Abbas Hamadi
was involved in the kidnappings.
   The abductions came shortly after Mohammed Hamadi was arrested
at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987 carrying liquid explosives.
Abbas Hamadi was arrested in Frankfurt on Jan. 26, 1987.
   Mohammed Hamadi was charged in February with murder, hijacking,
hostage-taking and other crimes stemming from the June 1985
hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut, during which a U.S. Navy
diver was killed and 39 U.S. citizens held hostage for 17 days.
   A Frankfurt state court on Tuesday said Mohammed Hamadi would be
tried in a youth court because ``the perpetration of the crime''
may have begun before he was age 21. The statement said the state
prosecutor's office in Frankfurt listed Mohammed Hamadi's birth
date as June 13, 164.
   ``The state court has studied this case intensively and is
convinced that it belongs in the juvenile court,'' Hesse state
court spokesman Thomas Kehren said.
   It is possible that the juvenile tribunal declines the case,
``but that is highly unlikely under the circumstances,'' Kehren
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Under West German law, defendants age 21 or older at the time of
the crime are considered adults, those between 18 and 21 are
adolescents, and those under age 18 are juveniles. Adolescents as
well as juveniles are tried in juvenile courts.

   Demolitions experts disarmed three
powerful homemade bombs at a New Jersey Turnpike rest area and
arrested a man for possession of explosives, police said.
   Lt. Barry Roberson, a state police spokesman, said the bombs and
some leftover explosive materials were discovered in the car of a
man attempting to flee a trooper Tuesday morning.
   Trooper Robert Cieplinsky told his superiors he had noticed the
man acting suspiciously near a parked car at turnpike rest area
less than 10 miles west of New York City, Roberson said.
   Cieplinsky stopped the car and noticed a black gym bag filled
with gunpowder canisters and small pellets, which Roberson
described as objects used to make homemade bombs.
   The trooper discovered the three bombs in the trunk of the car,
Roberson said, and arrested the man for possession of an explosive
device.
   Roberson declined to give the man's name and said an
investigation was continuing.
   Cieplinsky closed off a portion of the rest area and called for
assistance from the state police bomb and explosives investigative
team, who used a water cannon to saturate the devices and render
them inoperable, Roberson said.
   In Tokyo, a Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the ministry had received information through the
Japanese Embassy in Washington that the man detained in New Jersey
for possession of explosives was carrying a Japanese passport.
   He said the ministry would seek more details about the man and
provide information to U.S. investigators, but declined to give
further details.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service reported that Japanese authorities
believe the man held in the United States may have a forged
passport or may have obtained it illegally.
   Kyodo said Japanese investigators would ask the United States to
send the fingerprints of the man detained for identification.

<HEAD>Candidate's Ex-Wife Calls Him Anti-Semitic, Anti-Arab</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former wife of presidential candidate
Jean-Marie Le Pen says her ex-spouse is anti-Arab, anti-Semitic and
does not practice the morality he preaches to his extreme-right
followers.
   ``He is profoundly anti-Arab,'' Pierrette Le Pen is quoted as
saying in an interview in this month's French version of Rolling
Stone magazine, appearing today.
   ``I have always lived in the anti-Semitism of Jean-Marie Le Pen.
... He completely denies the existence of the (Nazi) gas chambers.''
   Ms. Le Pen said her ex-husband used racial slurs to refer to
Jews and called Adolf Hitler ``Uncle Dolphie,'' when saying, for
instance, ``Uncle Dolphie didn't go far enough.''
   She made similar comments in an interview published last week in
the Socialist-leaning monthly magazine Globe. The statements have
spiced up a presidential campaign described by French political
observers as listless and lacking serious debate.
   A spokesman for Le Pen, Alain Vizier, said neither he nor the
candidate would comment on Ms. Le Pen's remarks.
   Le Pen, 59, a former paratrooper and Foreign Legionnaire, has
often been charged with racism, but has won libel cases against his
accusers.
   Running on an anti-immigration platform with slogans such as
``Keep France French,'' Le Pen says North African workers should be
sent back home and social benefits should go first to the native
French.
   Ms. Le Pen, who left her husband in 1984 after 25 years of
marriage, raised eyebrows last year when she appeared half-nude in
Playboy magazine in a series of seductive poses.
   In the interviews, she is quoted as saying that her willingness
to divulge family secrets was aimed at getting back personal
possessions, including the ashes of her mother, family photos,
letters, furniture, and money.
   Ms. Le Pen is quoted as saying she has sued seven times for the
return of her possessions and lost.
   Last fall, Le Pen caused a scandal when he said during a radio
interview that the question of whether Nazi gas chambers existed
was merely a ``detail of World War II.''
   Le Pen leans heavily in his campaign rallies on the themes of
God and family, saying he is the only candidate to do so.
   But Ms. Le Pen is quoted in Rolling Stone as saying that her
former husband ``had no sense of the morality which should reign
within a family ... (and) was completely contrary to the image he
wants to give.''
   She said he did not strongly discipline the couple's three
daughters, who, she now says, refuse to see their mother.
   Le Pen, whose National Front party has 33 deputies in the
577-seat National Assembly, is ranked fourth in opinion polls
behind Socialist President Francois Mitterrand and the two main
conservative candidates, Premier Jacques Chirac and former Premier
Raymond Barre.
   The latest opinion polls give Le Pen as much as 12 percent of
the vote.

<HEAD>College Applications by Blacks Up, Suggesting End of Enrollment
Decline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intrigued by a 35 percent increase in applications
from black students for 1988-89, Brandeis University has found a
similar trend at other colleges nationwide.
   Ten of 11 schools responding to Brandeis' request reported a
growth in applications from blacks compared to the last academic
year.
   The largest increase was 52 percent at William and Mary College
in Williamsburg, Va.; the lowest was 0.33 percent at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.
   Oberlin College in Ohio reported no change and nine schools did
not provide information for Brandeis' informal survey.
   Some education experts were upbeat about the figures, saying
they appeared to point to an imminent reversal of a protracted
downturn in black enrollment.
   The most recent statistics supplied by the U.S. Census Bureau
show 28.6 percent of college-age blacks enrolled in colleges and
universities in 1986, compared to 33.4 percent in 1976. The low was
26.1 percent in 1985.
   ``If this survey is reflecting the national trend, this is great
news,'' said Bob Hochstein, spokesman for the Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of Teaching. ``When they're up that
dramatically, it suggests that will be translated into increased
enrollment.
   ``It suggests that progress is being made and ... it's a tribute
to colleges and universities that have actively been pursuing
enrollments,'' said Hochstein, whose nonprofit foundation acts as a
think-tank for American education.
   Others were more cautious.
   ``It may result in an increase in enrollment,'' said Trevor
Chandler, dean in residence at the Council of Graduate Schools in
Washington. ``But increased applications don't necessary translate
into increased admissions.''
   Six other colleges reported increases in black applications.
They are Clemson University, South Carolina, with 51.4 percent;
Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, 37.4 percent; Rice
University, Houston, 33 percent; Claremont Colleges, California,
19.6 percent; Reed College, Portland, Ore., 11 percent, and the
University of California at Los Angeles, 10.3 percent.
   The admissions office at Syracruse University, Syracuse, N.Y.,
said figures were up from last year but did not break them down
into a percentage increase, in the survey. Brandeis provided a copy
of results to The Associated Press.
   Applications in general also were up but in lagged far behind
those from blacks alone. Claremont and Clemson, both with 15
percent, showed the highest overall rate of increase in
applications.
   Brandeis spokesman Bob Mitchell said in a telephone interview
Tuesday that the colleges polled were picked at random, with the
intention of covering as large an area as possible.
   Admissions or minority recruitment officials at several colleges
concurred in separate interviews that more aggressive courting of
blacks in recent years likely played a role in the upswing.
   Rice spokesman Bill Noblitt said his college ``blanketed the
country'' last year with information that minority scholarships
were available to gifted blacks.
   Richard Vos, Claremont's dean of admissions and finances, said
``there was a lot of hand-wringing'' in the early 1980s, when black
admissions began declining, and ``in our shop, we spent more time
and money on minority recruiting than in past years.''

   Little Rock's suspended police chief
apparently killed himself with a bullet to the head, authorities
said, one day after he denounced a misdemeanor theft charge against
him as unjust.
   Jeff F. ``Doc'' Hale, 47, was found dead Tuesday at his home in
this town 30 miles northeast of Little Rock, said Lonoke County
Sheriff J.O. Isaac. Hale's wife, Jean, discovered his body in a
laundry room when she came home for lunch, Isaac said.
   Little Rock City Manager Tom Dalton said the single gunshot
wound appeared to be self-inflicted. However, Isaac declined to
speculate about the death until autopsy findings were released
today.
   No suicide note was found, Isaac said, but friends said Hale was
disturbed about the allegations against him.
   Hale was suspended with pay until a charge was settled that he
took less than $200 from a drugstore cash register in February and
March. Buice Drug Store, a popular hangout for politicians and
police, is owned by the son of state Rep. George Wimberly.
   Wimberly, the store's pharmacist, is a former Little Rock mayor
who has dabbled in police politics.
   Hale, who was arrested by state police outside the drugstore
March 10, said he had an unwritten arrangement with the elder
Wimberly to borrow money from the register. Other lawmen have said
they took similar loans.
   After a court appearance Monday on the charge, Hale labeled the
accusation ``a bunch of bull.'' He was to have been tried May 24,
and faced up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Kenneth W. Collins, Hale's neighbor of 17 years, said that
``everything was normal'' when he and the chief did farm work
Monday afternoon, although Hale was concerned about the effect of
his legal problems on his elderly mother.
   Hale promised ``to fight all this,'' Collins said.
   ``We said, `Hey, Doc, what can we do to help?''' Collins said.
``When I talked to him, he said: `I don't drink. I don't smoke. I
don't do anything wrong. And I can't believe any of this stuff.'''
   Attorney General Steve Clark, for whom Hale directed Medicaid
fraud investigations for four years, said the theft charge
``challenged at the core of what he held to be the most dear, and
that was his integrity and character.''
   Clark added, ``The pressure of that challenge, and there had to
be lots of it, in some way influenced his thinking or his decision
that led to his death.''
   Flags were at half-staff and officers wore black tape across
badges at the Little Rock Police Department, where Hale was
appointed chief Oct. 20, 1986. He joined the department in 1962.
Hale's annual salary as chief was $64,071, and he also received a
pension of $18,762 a year.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Legislature, meeting in a
marathon session, delivered a first-in-the-nation universal health
care bill to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis by a narrow margin early today.
   The state House accepted a House-Senate compromise by a vote of
77-75, and the Senate did the same by an 18-15 margin. Those close
votes came despite overwhelming Democratic majorities in both
chambers.
   Dukakis, who has frequently pointed to the health care plan as a
national model during his quest for the Democratic presidential
nomination, has indicated support for the compromise. Legislative
leaders said he could sign it as early as next week.
   Lawmakers adopted the plan to guarantee health insurance to all
Massachusetts residents by 1992 after nearly nine months of intense
legislative debate and negotiations with a host of special
interests,
   ``It's been very difficult,'' Senate Ways and Means Chairman
Patricia McGovern said. ``It's been the most difficult piece of
legislation I have ever been involved with personally.''
   But McGovern, who first proposed universal health care for the
state more than a year ago, added, ``I think it has the potential
to be the most rewarding piece of legislation. It really is
landmark. It is historic. It is breaking new ground.''
   Dukakis' presidential ambitions were also raised at every turn
in the drive to pass the bill. ``I hear television commercials are
being held up so the governor can run with this legislation in New
York,'' Assistant Minority Leader Kevin Poirier said Tuesday,
referring to the New York presidential primary April 19.
   But a Dukakis campaign spokesman denied the report. ``I know of
no such commercials in existence,'' he said. ``Commercials aren't
made in advance. You wait until things happen and then you put them
together.''
   McGovern and House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Voke, who
co-chaired the committee that reached the compromise and were floor
leaders on the bill, pointed to heavy lobbying from a multitude of
special interests as the main factor in the close legislative
voting.
   Businesses, hospitals, insurers, labor unions and consumers all
had concerns about the bill. As late as Tuesday, labor unions were
upset by a provision in the compromise bill that potentially could
reduce public employee health care benefits by removing the issue
from collective bargaining.
   The health care bill sets Jan. 1, 1992, as the deadline for
businesses to begin offering health insurance to their employees or
begin paying an surcharge to the state so it can provide coverage
to the state's estimated 600,000 uninsured residents.
   The bill includes tax breaks, exemptions for businesses of five
or fewer employees, state-sponsored pooled insurance and the
possibility of outright state subsidies.
   Republican opponents repeatedly warned that the bill would raise
business costs, putting some out of business and discouraging
expansion of others.
   The two-part bill also renews the state's hospital financing
law, containing about $1 billion in hospital fee increases over the
next four years. Another $95 million in new revenues was added for
42 hard-pressed hospitals.
   Despite the Legislature's lengthy consideration of the proposal,
some lawmakers were still asking late Tuesday how much the bill
will cost, what it will offer the uninsured and how many people
ultimately will take advantage of the program.
   Dukakis has budgeted $78 million in fiscal 1989 as the state's
share in the first full year of the four-year universal health care
phase-in. But cost estimates over the four-year period vary widely
_ from $550 million to $1.2 billion.
   Specific health plan coverage will be decided later by a new
state agency set up to oversee the program.

   A group trying to extort $1.6 million mailed poison
and explosives to five branches of a Japanese bank, police said
today.
   Authorities in Osaka said the target of the extortion attempt is
the Sanwa Bank. They said parcels containing threatening letters
along with the poison and explosives were sent in the last two
weeks to Sanwa branches in Osaka and the western cities of Okayama
and Takamatsu.
   One police spokesman said the poison included cyanide and
arsenide and that there was enough to kill about 3,000 people. He
said the explosives included picric acid and saltpeter.
   According to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
one of the letters read: ``We have obtained 14 weapons, including
poison and explosives such as cyanide, arsenide, arsenic acid,
dynamite and black explosives for a revolution. ... We don't want
to be forced to give them to the Red Army. You'll buy them for 200
million yen.''
   The figure is equivalent to $1.6 million. The Red Army is a
leftist Japanese terrorist group.
   The police spokesman was unable to say why the extortionists
chose Sanwa. Bank spokesman Soichi Hayakawa said, ``We can't even
guess why, judging from the contents of the letters.''
   Police said the first parcel was mailed April 4 to Sanwa's
Kawara-machi Branch in Osaka. A note demanded the branch give 200
million yen in two cardboard boxes to a deliveryman who would visit
the branch three days later.
   Sanwa informed police of the attempt, and police formed a
35-member special task force. No one came for the money on April 7.
   More parcels were sent to the other Sanwa branches, with the
last one delivered Tuesday to the Takamatsu branch on Shikoku
island, about 344 miles southwest of Tokyo. This time, there were
no instuctions on what the bank should do with the 200 million yen.
   Instead, police officials said, the letter in the parcel read in
part: ``We note that our proposal has been rejected. ... We may
become the killers.''
   Sanwa, ranked fifth among Japanese banks in fund volume, is
based in Osaka and has branches in Tokyo and other major Japanese
cities.

   Increased American investments in South Africa
may do more to erase apartheid than sanctions and disinvestment,
former President Richard M. Nixon said today.
   South Africa has failed a ``moral litmus test'' on its policies
toward blacks, Nixon said.
   ``South Africa presents a problem where everybody agrees we are
against apartheid,'' he said. ``The question is what can we do
about it?''
   He said sanctions and pulling out investments should be given a
chance to work, but if they don't ``we may have to go completely in
the other direction.
   ``I do know that American corporations are one of the most
progressive forces for change and I think it's really better to
have them into South Africa, adopting policies, providing equal
opportunities and going far beyond that than their getting out and
having South African racists running'' the country.
   Nixon made his remarks on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program in the last
of three interviews in connection with his seventh and latest book,
``1999.''

   Geraldine M. Sagel, who shot her 52-year-old
retarded son because of concern about his care after her death,
died last month, according to a family member.
   Mrs. Sagel, 81, died March 29 in Condell Memorial Hospital in
Libertyville, said her daughter, Bonnie Virnala.
   In February, Mrs. Sagel pleaded guilty to aggravated battery
after shooting her son in a case a judge characterized as a
mother's misguided act of love.
   On Sept. 30 Mrs. Sagel used a .22 caliber pistol that belonged
to her husband to fire a shot at her son Jack, who was hit in the
shoulder.
   ``I was afraid that he would be on the mercy of the world, ''
she told the judge. `` I love him too much.''
   Lake County Circuit Judge William D. Block sentenced her to 30
months probation for the shooting.
   Sagel has been in the Waukegan Developmental Center since
shortly after the incident, said Ms. Virnala.

   The issue of noisy tennis ball machines
in this upscale town is being put on hold.
   Town Council members acknowledged Tuesday that most of them had
never heard a tennis ball machine and decided to hold off on
approving the first reading of an ordinance that would limit their
use.
   ``I think we need to listen to them first,'' Mayor Yvelyne
``Deedy'' Marix said. ``Then we'll rediscuss the entire subject.''
   The issue was taken up by the town's Ordinances, Rules and
Standards Committee two weeks ago after a few residents complained
about the machines, which are in frequent use on backyard courts
here.
   The residents want the machines' use limited to the same hours
allotted for heavy construction. They want the machines banned
their use Sundays.
   ``I do want to take into consideration the people who want to
sit and enjoy their patios without the thump-thwack or whatever it
is,'' said Council President Nancy Douthit.
   But Councilman Bill Weinberg said he's getting pressure from
another interest group.
   ``I've also had complaints from tennis players who don't want
their rights violated,'' he said.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci reiterated
today that under an accord ending the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan, the United States will continue aiding the Afghan
rebels while the Soviet Union supplies weapons to the Marxist
government.
   ``We have negotiated what we call positive symmetry with the
Soviets,'' Carlucci said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
``That is to say if they continue their aid to the puppet
government, we will continue our aid to the freedom fighters.''
   Under the U.S.-Soviet agreement, which Secretary of State George
Shultz will sign in Geneva on Thursday, the Kremlin will begin
withdrawing its 115,000 soldiers from Afghanistan on May 15.
   The rebels have rejected the peace pact and have vowed to
continue fighting. Under a compromise with Moscow, the United
States will continue sending weapons to the rebels, while the
Kremlin continues providing arms to the Marxist government.
   Pakistan, which delivers supplies, including U.S. Stinger
missiles, to the rebels, has agreed not to interfere in Afghan
affairs, according to the agreement.
   Carlucci, asked if there would be a problem in funneling aid to
the rebels in light of Pakistan's assurance of non-interference,
said:
   ``The agreement is that their will be positive symmetry, and if
aid to the Soviet puppet regime continues, we will be able to
continue our aid. We will be able to work that out.''
   The Chicago Tribune reported today that the United States does
plan to continue funneling aid to Afghan rebels through Pakistan.

<HEAD>De Mita Forms Government After Monthlong Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Ciriaco De Mita, the Christian
Democrat leader, today formed Italy's 48th postwar government and
ended a monthlong political crisis triggered by the resignation of
his predecessor, Giovanni Goria.
   The 60-year-old De Mita put together a coalition of his party,
the Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals, the
same five-party alliance that has governed Italy through most of
the 1980s.
   De Mita presented his choice for the 32-member Cabinet to
President Francesco Cossiga at the Quirinal Palace.
   Goria stepped down March 11 after eight turbulent months in
office. His coalition was weakened by factional disputes in his own
Christian Democrat party as well as feuding with the Socialists,
led by former Premier Bettino Craxi.
   Leaders of the five parties agreed on the terms for the new
government Monday, and the parties met again separately Tuesday to
give their final endorsement.
   The crucial support came from the Socialists, the second-largest
party in the coalition and a frequent foil for the Christian
Democrats, who have led or dominated all Italian governments since
the end of World War II.
   Most of De Mita's Cabinet members were holdovers from the
previous Goria government. They included Foreign Minister Giulio
Andreotti, a Christian Democrat; Defense Minister Valerio Zanone, a
Liberal; and Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato, a Socialist.
   Gianni De Michelis, a Socialist, was given the post of deputy
premier previously held by Amato.
   Goria did not join the new government as a minister.
   With De Mita holding both the premiership and his post as
secretary of the Christian Democrat Party, at least for the time
being, the government was viewed as potentially stronger than
Goria's coalition.
   But Craxi said Tuesday he thought it would be a ``miracle'' if
De Mita's government lasted through the end of the legislative term
in 1992.
   As required by the constitution, De Mita will seek a confidence
vote in Parliament, where the coaliton holds a comfortable majority
in both houses. The vote is expected next week.
   As a sign of the kind of problems De Mita could face,
parliamentary deputies of the small Social Democrat Party
immediately protested their party's choice of its two Cabinet
ministers.
   De Mita cleared the final hurdle when the parties on Monday
agreed on proposed antitrust legislation for the Italian media.
Under the accord, no individual or group can own or control both a
newspaper and a television network.
   The proposed law would also clear the way for live nationwide
broadcasts by private networks.
   On the controversial issue of nuclear power, the parties put off
a final decision on the fate of the unfinished nuclear plant at
Montalto di Castro near Rome. The Socialists had demanded the plant
be reconverted to another form of energy, while the Christian
Democrats favored completing the nuclear station.

   Hundreds of weapons teams today
combed streets for unexploded missiles from a weekend blast that
showered rockets on residential areas and killed 96 people.
   The government said Tuesday that 170 teams of explosives experts
were working around the clock and had cleared 20,000 missiles,
grenades and other weapons from the streets of the twin cities of
Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
   The weapons rained down on residents after an explosion Sunday
at a army ammunition depot, injuring nearly 1,100 and causing
secondary explosions and fire. About 100 people remained missing
today.
   The government has said the blast may have been the work of
saboteurs seeking to undermine Pakistan's position in talks on
withdrawing Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   The Defense Ministry said today it would begin detonating
unexploded ammunition in an unpopulated area near Islamabad.
   A four-man U.S. team of explosives experts so far recovered
about 20 fallen projectiles at American facilities, including the
U.S. Embassy.
   Medical vans roamed the streets and medical workers vaccinated
people for cholera and typhoid. The neighborhoods remained without
water and electricity.
   Little pockets of fire still burned today at the Ojeri Army Camp
where the initial blast occurred. Many houses in surrounding
neighborhoods were damaged, and narrow alleys were littered with
bricks, twisted metal, broken furniture and glass.
   Government teams inspected damage and promised compensation to
victims within three days.
   No official cause of the initial blast was given. But Defense
Minister Rana Naeem Mahmoud said Tuesday that military
investigators ``are not ruling out the possibility of sabotage.''
   He said saboteurs might have been attempting to put pressure on
Pakistan before the signing of the Geneva agreements on
Afghanistan, scheduled for Thursday. Pakistan has been supplying
weapons to rebels fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government.
   Eyewitnesses said they spotted burning trucks bearing Afghan
license plates Sunday near the ammunition depot.
   The disaster has prompted several small demonstrations accusing
authorities of negligence. Some opposition leaders have called for
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq to resign.

   A black guerrilla pulled the
pin on a hand grenade after police seized him today and killed
himself and two white officers, authorities said.
   Five hours later, a second guerrilla was shot to death when he
hurled a grenade and fired an AK-47 automatic rifle at police who
tracked him down in Mpumalanga, near Durban, police said.
   Three residents were wounded by the gunfire, police said.
   Police were searching for a third man and said all three were
from the outlawed African National Congress, the main guerrilla
group fighting South Africa's white-led government.
   The suspects were not identified.
   The incident began at about 1 a.m. when police patrolling the
black township of Mpumalanga spotted three black men, one carrying
an AK-47 automatic rifle, according to a statement from police
headquarters in Pretoria. The black men fled, and the policemen
chased them, police said.
   The first one to be caught set off the grenade and blew himself
up along with two constables, police said.
   A third policeman was slightly wounded when he was struck in the
shoulder by shrapnel, police said.
   Police said they found the second suspect at about 6 a.m. and
shot him when he threw a grenade and opened fire at them.

   Israeli soldiers today shot and killed three
Arab guerrillas who were trying to infiltrate from Lebanon on a
hostage-taking mission, the military said.
   Violent protests persisted for a second day in the Gaza Strip,
which was home to five of the eight Palestinians whom Israel
deported to Lebanon on Monday. Hospital and relief officials said
at least 21 Arabs were injured.
   Israel says the deportees incited much of the violence in the
occupied lands that has claimed the lives of 143 Palestinians, one
Israeli soldier and a tenn-age Jewish settler since it began Dec. 8.
   Before dawn today, soldiers on a routine patrol spotted the
three guerrillas just north of the Kfar Yuval collective farm,
chased them and opened fire, the army said in a statement.
   The military communique did not give the affiliation of the
guerrillas who carried out today's raid but said they were armed
with M-16 rifles, four rockets and hand grenades. It said they were
on a ``hostage-taking mission'' but gave no other details.
   It was the second attempted infiltration in nine days at the
same location and the 10th across Israel's borders since November.
An April 5 attempt was claimed by two factions of Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Israeli officials have linked past guerrilla raids to the
4-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza, which
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   In the Gaza Strip, United Nations relief workers and Arab
hospital officials said soldiers opened fire today at protesters
outside a school in Jabaliya refugee camp, wounding 14-year-old
Diah Ahmed Jaber in the left thigh.
   Twenty other Palestinians were injured by tear gas and rubber
bullets, said Dr. Ahmed Yassih of Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, where
some of the injured were treated.
   In the Deir el Balah refugee camp, soldiers today confiscated
identification documents from most of the men in the camp and told
them they would have to pay their electricity and water bills
before they would be returned, said U.N. official Eric Peterson, an
administrator of the camps.
   The Israeli military command said it was checking the reports.
   The army said one Arab died, 25 were hurt and one soldier was
injured Tuesday in fighting in the West Bank and Gaza.
   In another development today, an Israeli newspaper said an army
inquiry into the killing of a Jewish settler girl in the West Bank
village of Beita last week indirectly would blame the shooting on
the Jewish guard Roman Aldubi, who was knocked out by a rock during
the melee and remains hospitalized.
   A preliminary army probe determined that 15-year-old Tirza Porat
died from a bullet fired by Aldubi's M-16 rifle. Settlers claim she
was shot either by an Arab who took the rifle or by an Arab with
another weapon. Israeli officers have said they believe Aldubi
accidentally fired the fatal shot in panic.
   The Hadashot newspaper said the final army report shows Arabs
wrested the rifle from Aldubi, but did not fire it. The paper said
the inquiry implies that Aldubi accidentally shot the girl before
he was knocked unconscious.
   The controversy over the shooting caused a stormy session of
Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday
during which the Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron accused Jewish
settlers of trying to manipulate public opinion against the army's
findings.
   ``I hope and pray we don't reach the stage in which we have to
have recourse to a polygraph test,'' the Jerusalem Post quoted him
as saying.
   Shomron has called the April 6 clash, which occurred as the
teen-age settlers and two armed guards were on a holiday hike, a
misunderstanding and said residents of Beita had sought to aid and
protect the Israeli youths.
   The Post also said Shomron indicated the army razed 16 Arab
homes in Beita before the investigation was concluded because it
believed swift action was needed to prevent reprisals by settlers.
   Left-wing legislator Yossi Sarid accused the settlers of
pressuring the army into taking the punitive measures even though
it was not yet clear if any Arabs were involved in killing the
Jewish girl, the newspaper said.
   Ehud Olmert of the right-wing Likud bloc criticized the army for
leaking findings on the shooting to the Israeli media.
   ``I recommend that army officers not make media appearances and
then they won't be dragged into political debates,' Olmert
reportedly said.

<HEAD>Paper Says Ethnic Riot Started by Azerbaijani Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethnic rioting in a southern Soviet city that
killed at least 32 people was sparked by refugees who fled the
Armenian republic for Azerbaijan, a newspaper said today.
   The report in the weekly Moscow News confirmed previous reports
from unofficial sources that Azerbaijanis who fled Armenia during
large protests in the neighboring republic sparked three days of
rioting that began Feb. 28. Today's report was based on comments by
officials of Azerbaijan.
   ``We didn't pay enough attention to the Azerbaijani refugees
from the Armenian city of Kafan, and they became the match from
which everything erupted,'' Melek Bairamova, one official, told
Moscow News.
   The newspaper did not say why the Azerbaijanis fled Armenia, but
Armenians began mass protests in mid-February for annexation of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. Armenian activists said
hundreds of thousands of people took part in the demonstrations,
but that all were peaceful.
   Moscow News said Communist Party authorities in Azerbaijan still
listed 5,120 Azerbaijani refugees from Armenia.
   The official media has said 32 people _ 26 Armenians and six
Azerbaijanis _ died in the Sumgait rioting. Armenian activists
claim the death toll was much higher.
   Sumgait Prosecutor Ismet Gaibov has authorized more than 60
arrests so far, and a team of more than 100 investigators from
throughout the country is continuing its work, the newspaper said.
   Vagif Kakhramonov, assistant director of the city Health
Department, said 81 people were treated for injuries in the
rioting, and that 16 of them remained hospitalized in Baku.
   The city Communist Party chief, Muslim Zade, the mayor,
Tavakkula Mamedov, and the police chief, K. Dzhafarov, all were
fired after the rioting, Moscow News said.
   The newspaper said Sumgait streets are empty at night, even
though a curfew was lifted several weeks ago, and that the streets
of the Azerbaijani capital Baku also are usually quiet.
   ``The situation has created psychological pressure: on trolleys,
at the market, at the airport, they only talk about what happened,
about the relations between Azerbaijanis and Armenians,'' it said.

   There were no takers for the former home
of Jim and Tammy Bakker and the PTL auction fell far short of its
$4 million goal, but ministry officials say they'll keep trying to
sell off excess property.
   The auction Tuesday brought in only $596,500 toward the $5.3
million the PTL ministry, based in nearby Fort Mill, needs to raise
by a May 2 bankruptcy court deadline.
   Only five bids were accepted on nine properties offered. Bids on
two others were insufficient and a $425,000 bid on former PTL
President Richard Dortch's home is still being considered, PTL
Trustee David Clark said.
   There were no bids on the former residence of the Bakkers, the
ministry's deposed founders, Clark said, although several people
have expressed a serious interest in the home.
   ``It's the kind of house that you have to have a special buyer
for,'' said Clark. ``And I think that person is the kind of person
who might not come to an auction.''
   The auctioneer began the bidding at $900,000 on the former
Bakker residence, a 9,300-square-foot lakeside home with 4 bedrooms
and 5{ bathrooms in Tega Cay.
   But auctioneer Rodney L. Robinson stopped the auction when he
had dropped the price to $500,000 without any takers.
   ``We didn't get an offer that I thought was substantial enough
to open the bidding,'' Robinson said afterward.
   About 40 bidders participated in the 30-minute auction.
   One of the rejected bids was $900,000 for 33 acres of
undeveloped land. Clark said that property and all others remaining
would now be sold through real estate agents.
   ``We are not going to give away the assets of the church,'' he
said.
   PTL has an estimated $60 million debt as well as a $60 million
to $80 million claim of back taxes from the IRS, Clark said.
   PTL already has laid off almost 300 of the 1,153 employees on
hand at Bakker's departure last year amid a sex scandal. Clark said
Tuesday that officials are reviewing all operations and will make
further cutbacks if necessary.

   Leslie Lowenfield was executed in the
electric chair early today denying to the end that he killed his
girlfriend and four of her relatives, including her 4-year-old
daughter, in a jealous rage.
   ``Don't give up on me, although my life will be over tonight,
because the one responsible is still out there,'' said the
34-year-old Lowenfield after he was led into the death chamber at
the Louisiana State Penitentiary.
   On Tuesday, his lawyer lost appeals to the Louisiana Supreme
Court, a federal district judge and a federal appeals court.
   His attorney had argued that he should be spared because he was
a paranoid schizophrenic who could not understand what it would
mean to be executed or why he was being executed.
   Shortly after midnight, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to issue
a fifth stay of execution for him.
   Lowenfield was pronounced dead at 12:25 a.m.
   It was the nation's fourth execution this year and Louisiana's
second. The state has put to death 17 murderers since it resumed
executions in 1983.
   It was also the 97th execution in the nation to be carried out
since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing the death
penalty.
   Lowenfield, a welder from Guyana who came to the United States
from Canada in 1975 on a work permit, spent most of his final hours
with Dale Brown, head basketball coach at Louisiana State
University, and two spiritual advisers.
   The murders occurred Aug. 30, 1982, in the New Orleans suburb of
Marrero. Prosecutors said Lowenfield barged into his girlfriend's
house and shot everybody there, including her 4-year-old daughter,
as most of them were eating boiled crabs at a kitchen table.
   The victims were the girlfriend, Sheila Thomas, 27, who was a
Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputy; her daughter, Shantel Osborne,
4; Ms. Thomas' stepfather Owen Griffin, 45; mother Myrtle Griffin,
44; and Shantel's father, Carl Osborne, 33.
   Before the 1984 trial, Lowenfield was found competent, and he
refused to allow his lawyers to use insanity as a defense,
insisting instead that he was in Jacksonville, Fla., at the time
the family was killed.
   Prosecutors said Lowenfield was jealous of Osborne. They said
Lowenfield and Ms. Thomas had lived together in a stormy
relationship until earlier in the summer of 1982 when he set the
house on fire and she moved out.
   He was convicted of three first-degree murders and two
manslaughters and received three death sentences.
   Two members of the victims' family _ Connie and Byron Encalade
of Harvey _ were in the front row of witnesses when Lowenfield
entered the execution chamber. He addressed them first, saying:
``Connie and Byron, I hope y'all feel satisfied.''
   He then spoke briefly to his original defense lawyer, the
sheriff's detective who investigated the case and also the chief
prosecutor.
   Then, after professing his innocence, Lowenfield said: ``Thanks
to y'all. Peace.''
   Brown, a Catholic priest and a Catholic nun arrived about 9 p.m.
Tuesday to spend Lowenfield's final hours with him, said Warden
Hilton Butler.
   Brown, widely recognized as a motivational speaker, had been
corresponding with Lowenfield since Brown took the LSU team on a
tour of Angola's death row in 1984, Butler said.
   ``It was a lifetime here tonight _ a lifetime with Leslie, a
lifetime with the warden. You don't see it in the movies,'' Brown
said after the execution. ``I asked him several things _ Can I ease
the pain? And he said, `No, thank you.'''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Sue Federal Agencies to Stop Dolphin Kills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental groups armed with videotape
of Panamanian fishermen killing dozens of dolphins are suing the
government to enforce an import ban on nations violating the Marine
Mammal Protection Act.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court Tuesday against
several federal agencies, claims that they are allowing the illegal
slaughter of hundreds of thousands of dolphins by failing to
enforce the act.
   The suit also asks that the Commerce Department be compelled to
enforce requirements that the U.S. tuna industry use the best
equipment and safety measures to minimize the killing of dolphins.
   ``Each year tens to hundreds of thousands of dolphins _ which
unlike tuna are expressly protected by federal law _ are brutally
and needlessly killed and their battered and torn bodies discarded
into the sea,'' said the lawsuit by the Earth Island Institute, the
Marine Mammal Fund and Berkeley environmentalist David R. Brower.
   Many dolphins die during tunafishing operations because they
tend to congregate above the schools of tuna, and nets trap both
tuna and dolphins.
   Named in the suit, in addition to Commerce, are the Treasury
Department, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and
the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   In Washington, NOAA spokesman Brian Gorman called the lawsuit
``specious'' because ``it makes it sound as if we're ignoring some
regulations that haven't gone into effect yet.''
   He said NOAA, which is part of the Commerce Department,
published regulations last month that go into effect next Monday to
force foreign tuna fleets to adhere to the same limits as American
fleets or run the risk of having their tuna haul embargoed.
   The U.S. fishing industry has an overall dolphin kill limit of
20,500 a year, and has abided by that limit, Gorman said. Foreign
fleets selling tuna in the United States are supposed to abide by a
comparable limit, but Gorman acknowledged some countries have
ignored the quota.
   According to the Marine Fisheries Service, 125,000 dolphins or
porpoises were killed annually by commercial fishermen between 1983
and 1987, most of them by foreign fleets. Two years ago, U.S.
fleets reached their quota in October and were ordered to suspend
fishing for the rest of the year.
   The 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act proclaimed an ``immediate
goal that the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of
marine mammals permitted in the course of commercial fishing
operations be reduced to insignificant levels approaching a zero
mortality and serious injury rate.''
   To achieve that goal, Congress granted the Secretary of Commerce
the power to enforce the regulations of the act.
   Dolphin kills are associated with yellowfin tuna fishing in the
eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, a 3,000-mile wide area that
stretches from Southern California to Chile.
   The tuna swim beneath schools of dolphins that glide near the
water's surface. Tuna boats encircle the schools with giant purse
seine nets that trap both the dolphins and the tuna.
   As many dolphins as possible are supposed to be released, but
some inevitably die or are injured, ``their beaks and flippers
broken or ripped from their bodies when they become entangled in
the nets,'' the suit said.

<DATELINE>OKEECHOBEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An accident that overturned two boats
and swept a fisherman to his death under a Lake Okeechobee lock
gate was probably caused by a 5-foot chicken snake, an investigator
said.
   ``Sometimes the truth sounds very abstract,'' said Don Grey of
the Florida Marine Patrol. ``But I'm 95 percent positive. As
far-fetched as it sounds, I have to go with it.''
   The snake apparently crawled over an electrical switch while the
two boats were in the chamber between the water-controlling gates
of a lock March 3. The locks are equipped with gates to change
water levels to raise or lower boats so they can enter and leave
Lake Okeechobee.
   The reptile's weight _ probably about two pounds, a snake expert
said _ put enough pressure on the switch to send a signal one lock
gate was shut when it actually was raised two to three feet, Grey
said Tuesday.
   That triggered the raising of the other gate, causing water to
rush into the chamber prematurely, swamping the boats and pulling
Hubert Major, 68, under one of the gates.
   Major, a retired engineer who lived in Lakeport, drowned in the
turbulent water. The other boater, Donald Blickenstaff of
Sharpsburg, Md., was able to reach a ladder on the wall and climb
out.
   The South Florida Water Management District has installed a
second switch on the other side of the gate in an effort to prevent
future accidents.
   ``There will have to be a 15-foot-long snake, or two snakes
working in cahoots with each other, to trip both of those switches
now,'' said Francis Davino, contract locktender at Lakeport.
   Chicken snakes, also called yellow rat snakes, are a common,
non-poisonous family of reptiles that can grow to 7{ feet. They
climb the lock structures to find warmth, Davino said.

   Art scholar Arnold Rubin, whose diverse

from human tattoos to the annual Tournament of Roses Parade, has
died at age 50.
   Rubin, an associate professor of art history at the University
of California, Los Angeles, died Saturday of stomach cancer, said
his daughter, Hannele Rubin.
   He had just finished editing and contributing to an anthology on
tattoos and other forms of body adornment titled ``Marks on

ears or we don't. We put designs on our bodies or we don't,'' Rubin
had said last month in discussing his studies of how human beings
adorn their bodies.
   He saw such actions as challenging the definitions of what it
means to be civilized.
   His study of the annual New Year's Day Tournament of Roses
parade in Pasadena started while he was teaching a class on art
research methods at UCLA. He recalled that he and his students
decided to find a local art event that couldn't be judged by
traditional standards.
   He said the parade caught his interest because the floats were
joint efforts, unlike most art works, which are created by a single
artist, and because the floats do not last, as traditional art is
supposed to.
   ``The measure of art is not in its permanence,'' he said of the
parade. ``This is a whole body of art born for a brief lifespan.
But this is still art.''
   Rubin is survived by his daughter and a son, Gabriel.

   New Premier Li Peng said today he believes in
fighting to the end to get what he wants but dismissed reports he
fights with Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang over policy.
   ``The major decisions are all products of collective
discussion,'' he told a news conference in the Great Hall of the
People. ``Zhao and I have no differences on political issues.''
   Li, 59, an engineer by training, generally sounds a more
cautious tone that Zhao in public statements, emphasizing the need
for economic stability over rapid change. He was approved as
premier during the 20-day session of the National People's Congress
that ended today.
   Zhao tends to emphasize the need for speedy action if China is
to transform its rice-paddy economy into one capable of competing
internationally in high technology.
   ``There is some comment in the foreign press that Zhao favors
reform and opening to the outside world ... and I'm in favor of
stabilizing the economy. They somehow pit these two views against
each other,'' Li said.
   ``This is a misunderstanding. The very purpose of reform ... is
to bring about economic growth and sustained and steady economic
growth in turn will facilitate the smooth pursuit of reform.''
   Asked to describe his philosophy of life, Li said he believed in
Marxism but added, ``I believe that if I set my mind to something I
can't waver but have to stick it out to the end.''
   The official translator used a more colorful phrase in English
than Li chose in Chinese, quoting Li as saying he believed in
``slugging it out.''
   Li's news conference was reminiscent of one given by Zhao last
November immediately after being appointed party general secretary.
   During that conference, the first of its kind by a high Chinese
leader, a high-spirited Zhao walked about the room, shaking hands
with reporters and clicking glasses with them as he fielded
questions.
   Li's news conference was more formal. He and his three vice
premiers _ Wu Xueqian, Yao Yilin and Tian Jiyun _ sat behind a
table facing rows of seated reporters.
   He appeared more relaxed than at past public appearances but
refused to answer several questions, including one about his
experiences during the far leftist Cultural Revolution. Hundreds of
thousands of Chinese suffered during that violent campaign from
1966-76, but Li was protected by his adopted father, then Premier
Chou En-lai.
   Asked if his own rapid rise in politics was due to his
relationship with Chou, China's most popular leader, Li said, ``I
think my promotion has nothing to do with him.''
   Li was orphaned at 3 when his father was killed by Nationalist
troops in China's civil war. Chou and his wife, Deng Yingchao, who
had no children of their own, adopted about 10 war orphans.
   Li attempted to portray his ties with Chou as somewhat distant,
saying that as a youth he lived with fellow students, not Chou and
Deng, and saw them only occasionally.
   ``But their ideals and moral influence had a profound impact on
my upbringing,'' he said.
   Li said university students who have put up posters in the past
week calling for more funds for education are ``welcome ... to
voice their opinion, much of which is correct.''
   He played down the significance of the posters and of a sit-in
Sunday in Tiananmen Square by 18 students and teachers. He said
Chinese have the right to express their views, but ``within the
scope allowed by law.''
   Li also said China would welcome talks with the exiled leader of
Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama.
   The Panchen Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's second-highest leader and a
supporter of Chinese rule, indicated last week that the Dalai Lama
would be allowed to live in Tibet if he returned to China from his
Indian exile.

   A light airplane plunged into the sea
on its approach to this city's airport and killed the U.S. pilot,
an aviation official said today.
   The two-motor, PA-44 Seminole plane crashed Tuesday about 1,800
feet short of a runway, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He said it was snowing and visibility was poor.
   The pilot's identity was not released.
   The plane left Narsarsuaq on Greenland's south coast 5{ hours
earlier. Its pilot planned an overnight stop at Reykjavik, the
official said.
   He said the plane initially left the United States for Europe,
but he gave no cities.
   Ice had apparently accumulated on the wings, he said.
   The plane disappeared from the airport's radar shortly after the
pilot radioed his approach to the airport. He did not report
problems, the official said.
   Rescue teams said they found the aircraft early today in 18 feet
of water, with the pilot's body inside.

   West Berlin authorities today removed the body of
an apparent suicide victim found hanging from a tree near the
Berlin Wall, a police spokesman said.
   West Berlin officials negotiated with counterparts in communist
East Berlin for two hours before they were allowed to take down the
body, West Berlin police spokesman Peter Glaser said. Although on
the western side of the Berlin Wall, it was in East Berlin city
limits.
   Witnesses in the Spandau district of West Berlin first reported
seeing the body early today.
   The victim was later identified as a 41-year-old West Berlin
resident who recently underwent treatment at a psychiatric clinic.
Police believe she committed suicide, Glaser said.

   The town elders have apologized, a
resident's ruffled feathers have been smoothed and Palm Beach has
got itself a name for a dead-end street.
   The Town Council voted unanimously Tuesday that the street that
joins Nicholas D. Athans' home to South Ocean Boulevard should be
named Via Agape.
   Athans, who was born in Greece and is a self-proclaimed
descendant of Plato, Hippocrates and Alexander the Great, explained
why he had lobbied for the road to be christened ``agape,'' which
he said means spiritual love.
   ``If we all practice love for our fellow man, we will have fewer
problems in the Middle East, in Afghanistan, in the rest of the
world,'' he said.
   That kind of miracle worked in this posh resort _ on a much
smaller scale _ over the name itself, which the council was less
than enthusiastic about last month.
   Two of its members, Bill Weinberg and Paul Ilyinsky, cracked
jokes at the time that Athans took to be ethnic slurs. He called
the remarks ``very ugly.''
   Both councilmen apologized, and Weinberg said they ``have come
to a common agreement and we now have a little agape between us.''
   ``I'm very pleased,'' Athans said. ``I thank all of them and I
accepted their apology.''

<TEXT>
   Backers of a drive to recall Mayor Federico Pena
were racing to meet today's deadline for filing petitions with
enough signatures to force a new mayoral election.
   ``We're counting them every minute,'' said recall organizer
Marge Doty, who launched the recall effort of the Metropolitan
Action Committee in January. ``It's looking real good.''
   The recall drive was launched late last year by a group angered
over what they claimed was fiscal mismanagement by the Pena
administration. The campaign gained momentum after many residents
were left stranded for several days by a major holiday snow storm
while Pena was vacationing out-of-state.
   Doty expressed optimism there would be a recall, but stopped
short Tuesday of a promise to deliver the necessary 39,091
signatures of registered Denver voters to the Denver Election
Commission. That number is 25 percent of the total number of votes
cast in the last mayoral election.
   ``I hope so,'' Doty said, adding, ``That's not a yes or a no.''
   Doty said volunteers worked late Tuesday to check the signatures
for accuracy. Only an unusual run of invalid signatures could block
the drive, Doty said. ``I don't think we're going to find that. I'm
not seeing that now.''
   While there is some dispute about procedures, Denver's charter
calls for an entirely new election.
   Any candidate who collected 300 names on a nominating petition
could run, and if no candidate mustered a clear majority, a run-off
would be held next.
   Susan Duncan, head of a volunteer committee of recall opponents,
predicts there will be enough errors in the petitions to thwart the
recall.
   Some 300 Pena supporters planned to gather at state Democratic
headquarters early Thursday to begin checking and challenging the
signatures.

   A judge rejected a jury's recommendation and
sentenced a former state trooper to the electric chair in the
slaying of his trooper girlfriend because the killing was a planned
execution.
   Prosecutors said Elizabeth Cobb, 31, was fatally shot in a plot
by Joe Duncan to collect $350,000 in life insurance benefits.
   The killing was a ``premeditated, diabolic, planned execution,''
Dallas County Circuit Judge J.C. Norton said Tuesday at the hearing
where he ordered that Duncan be executed instead of serving a life
sentence.
   Duncan, whose attorneys said they would seek a new trial, told
the judge at the hearing that he did not kill Miss Cobb and would
join her in heaven to be judged again.
   The judge said his assessment of Duncan's guilt stemmed from
videotaped interrogations during which Duncan initially denied any
knowledge of the Oct. 11 slaying but later conceded he discovered
Miss Cobb's body.
   Norton said Duncan was ``convicted out of his own mouth.''
   Duncan told investigators that he and Miss Cobb, 31, bought the
insurance policies while planning to be married.
   The slain trooper's body was found Oct. 12 seated in her patrol
car behind a rural church. Her service revolver, ticket book and
keys were missing and have never been located.
   The judge rejected the jury's recommendation, by a 10-2 vote
last month, that Duncan be given a sentence of life in prison
without parole. The jury had found Duncan guilty of two counts of
capital murder earlier in the month.

<TEXT>
   Seattle water officials say drought controls
enacted last summer have been ended due to recent spring storms
that have restored the city's water supplies.
   The reservoirs are above normal and 90 percent full, and
mountain snowpack will bring them up to capacity by June, officials
predicted in announcing the end of the drought emergency on Tuesday.
   However, Seattle residents were asked to continue to limit lawn
watering to every third day and to practice other conservation
techniques.
   Last year, the water department was faced with the worst water
shortage in its history as a result of a prolonged dry spell.
Special pumps had to be installed in reservoirs, and most outdoor
uses of watering were restricted.
   Other parts of the state remain dry, and water shortages are
expected this summer in some areas east of the Cascade Mountains.
   Meanwhile, firefighters in south-central Oregon battled a
60-acre blaze as other crews began mopping up another fire that
charred 35 acres in the Siskiyou Mountains.
   A series of fires has prompted forestry officials to consider
imposition of logging restrictions due to dry conditions in
southern Oregon.

   Activists with clubs, guns and bombs
fought police and political opponents in delayed local elections,
police said. Four people were reported killed and more than 100
wounded.
   About three-fourths of the country's 21,000 voting centers held
local council elections on Feb. 10, when at least 100 people were
killed. The violence forced officials to postpone other voting.
   Tuesday's new killings raised to six the number of election
deaths since voting resumed Saturday.
   Authorities shot two brothers Tuesday in an effort to break up a
riot at Kakta 50 miles north of Dhaka, said police who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said 20 people were hurt there when supporters of rival
candidates resorted to bombs, shotguns and clubs.
   Two other people were shot to death by rival groups in other
parts of the country, police said.
   Elections for local councils are not conducted along party
lines, but they arouse strong personal rivalries.
   In other unrest, students at Jahangirnagar University near Dhaka
rioted over the closing of their dining halls, and administrators
today shut down the school indefinitely.
   Students on Tuesday ransacked the vice chancellor's office,
damaged cars and buses, and cut telephone lines, according to a
statement released by the university.
   A strike has kept its two dining halls closed since April 5.
   Dhaka University, a center of political agitation, has been
closed indefinitely during opposition protests against President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad, a former army general who took power in a
1982 coup and later was elected president.

<TEXT>
   The city of Seattle has agreed to pay $50 million
to Washington Public Power Supply System bondholders left holding
$2.25 billion in debt after the system abandoned two nuclear power
plants and defaulted.
   Junius Hoffman, a court-appointed special master overseeing
negotiations to settle lawsuits in the case, announced the
agreement Tuesday. The tentative settlement has to be approved by
the federal court handling the securities-fraud litigation.
   The city is the fourth party to settle in the case, which
stemmed from the largest default in the history of the municipal
bond market. The two plants were abandoned six years ago, following
cost overruns and studies indicating the power from the plants
would not be needed.
   The city of Seattle was not among the 88 utilities that
participated in constructing the plants, WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5.
However, Hoffman noted, the city was a member of the supply system
and designated individuals who served on the WPPSS board of
directors and its executive board at the time the bonds for the two
projects were issued.
   The agreement was worked out between attorneys for class
plaintiffs _ people who have a fraud claim against the defendants _
and Chemical Bank, which represents bondholders, on one side, and
lawyers for the city and its insurance carriers on the other.
   Doug Jewett, Seattle city attorney, said the city would pay $6.8
million while its insurance carriers would pay $43.8 million.
   ``We think it is a good settlement for the city because the
dollar amount ... is less than would have been spent on defense
costs alone. Those costs have been running $2.5 million a year,''
Jewett said.
   Of even more concern to the city of Seattle was its risk as
being a defendant in a case where the plaintiffs are seeking $2.25
billion plus interest.
   ``With the settlement of the underwriters, we had become the
deepest pocket in the lawsuit,'' Jewett said. ``We are breathing
easier tonight now that that exposure has been removed.''
   Jim Irwin, an attorney with the Seattle law firm of Shidle
McBroom Gates & Lucas, who represented bondholders, said, ``We
think it is a fair and reasonable settlement and we are pleased.''
   The tentative settlements still need approval by U.S. District
Judge William Browning of Tucson, Ariz., who is presiding over the
fraud case and appointed Hoffman, a University of Arizona law
professor, as special master.
   All together, the four settlements reached so far would mean
payments of about $156 million to plaintiffs, Irwin said.
   The chief remaining defendants include the supply system and
utilities that participated in constructing the plants.
   Trial in the case is set to begin Sept. 7 in Tucson and could
last as long as two years.
   The supply system attempted to build five nuclear plants in all
during the 1970s. One plant is operating, two have been mothballed,
and two were abandoned.

   No state charges will be filed against a
control tower operator who caused an Amtrak crash that injured 25
people because authorities cannot prove drugs were involved, a
prosecutor said today.
   Traces of marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine were found in
blood and urine samples taken from the control tower operator, Tom
Connor, more than 72 hours after the Jan. 29 wreck in which a
passenger train struck a work vehicle, District Attorney William
Ryan said.
   ``However, his usage of these controlled substances cannot be
related back to the time of the accident and there is no evidence
that Connor was impaired by or under the influence of drugs at the
time of the accident,'' Ryan said at a news conference.
   Connor could have been charged with counts of recklessly
endangering another person, Ryan said, but prosecutors concluded
they could not prove the drug-use relationship needed for a
conviction.
   Connor said he forgot to switch the Amtrak Night Owl from the
track occupied by the work vehicle, but he denied being under the
influence of drugs or alcohol at the time, according to
investigators. The train was bound from Washington to Boston.
   Connor, who fled his post at nearby Marcus Hook immediately
after the accident, told National Transportation Safety Board
officials that he blamed himself. According to investigators, he
said he panicked when he saw the wreckage, fearing the two men on
the work vehicle had been killed.
   Connor did not emerge from hiding until three days after the
accident. He then spoke with investigators and underwent drug tests.
   Ryan said he will ask state lawmakers to introduce legislation
that would make it a crime for railroad operators to leave the
scene of an accident. U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon, a Republican who
represents the area, introduced similar legislation in Congress,
Ryan said.
   Connor, 30, quit his job in February before an Amtrak hearing on
the accident.

<TEXT>
   A mayor who says he doesn't want to have
anything to do with the Japanese has resigned his post to avoid
hindering his city's economic development.
   With his city in an area that has proven attractive to Japanese
investors and a trade mission from the city heading to Japan next
month, Mayor William V. Lietz announced that he was stepping down.
   ``I was on a destroyer (in the South Pacific) that was sunk .. .
and I was in the hospital,'' Lietz said. ``I don't care if it would
have been the Germans. I would have felt the same way. I'm an
American, and I love my country.''
   ``I am just going out because I figure it's best for the town,''
he said. ``I don't hate (the Japanese) at all, but I just don't
want to have anything to do with them personally.''
   City Council President Charles Brading said he would take over
as mayor, effective Friday, and would go on the 10-day trade
mission, set to depart May 6.
   Lietz, 64, who has been mayor for 13 years and was re-elected to
a four-year term in November, submitted his resignation to Brading
on Monday. His salary as mayor is $3,500 per year, and he also
works as a brick mason.
   At a council meeting last Thursday, Lietz issued a statement in
which he said his personal views should not affect the city's
economic development.
   ``I served our country in World War II. I do not apologize for
that,'' he said. ``But 40 years have gone by, and the world has
changed a great deal. The personal feelings of the mayor, any
mayor, must take a back seat to the greater needs of his
community.''
   ``I think it is unfortunate that this is the way to end his
service to Wapakoneta,'' Brading said. ``He has a right to his
opinion concerning the Japanese.''
   Wapakoneta, a city of about 8,000 people, is about 15 miles
north of Anna, where Honda has an engine plant, and about 50 miles
northwest of the Honda motorcycle and auto plants in Marysville.

   A British Airways jet with 119 people aboard had
to veer off a taxiway into mud to avoid being hit by another jet
that landed on the wrong runway at Gatwick Airport, authorities
said today.
   The incoming jet, a British Island Airways aircraft carrying 117
people, landed on the taxiway instead of the parallel runway it was
supposed to use, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
   The airport's main runway was closed for repaving and pilots
were directed to use alternative runways.
   The landing jet threw its engines into reverse and screeched to
a stop about 750 feet short of crashing into the other jet, said an
aviation authority spokesman.
   He said the incident occurred at 10:20 p.m. (5:20 p.m. EDT).
There were no injuries.
   Airport duty manager Ian MacCorquodale said the pilot of a
British Airways Boeing 737 was taxiing toward a runway for takeoff
when air traffic controllers ordered it to take evasive action to
avoid being hit by the British Island Airways BAC 111.
   He said the British Airways jet swung to one side and came to a
stop with its wheels stuck in the mud and grass beside the runway.
British Airways said its plane was traveling ``slowly'' when it
took the evasive action.
   MacCorquodale said the closure of the main runway shouldn't have
contributed to the near disaster, but the 1,300-strong Guild of Air
Pilots and Air Navigators disagreed.
   ``The worry lies in the fact that the British Airports Authority
are digging up the main runway at one of the busiest times of the
year,'' said the organization's clerk, Capt. Paul Wilson.
   Freddie Yetman, technical secretary of the British Airline
Pilots Association, said: ``Possibly the emergency runway was not
as well lit as the main runway would have been. But it's up to
pilots to be very, very careful when there is a change in landing
procedures.''
   Airport officials praised the controller who diverted the
British Airways jet. An airport spokesman said the controller
prevented ``an incident from becoming an accident.''
   He also commended the BA pilot for responding ``quickly and
positively.''
   Gatwick Airport, 25 miles south of London, was closed for 20
minutes while the British Airways jet was towed away. It was not
damaged.
   Next to London's Heathrow Airport, Gatwick is the world's second
busiest airport in terms of international passengers.
   The BAC-111 was arriving from Venice, Italy, and the British
Airways jet was destined for the Greek island of Rhodes.
   British Island Airways and the Civil Aviation Authority were
investigating the incident, and the airline said it took its flight
crew off duty while the investigation was going on.
   The Air Traffic Control Center in West London and the Civil
Aviation Authority said they are also investigating a near
collision Monday involving a military jet and a civilian helicopter.
   The helicopter, owned by Dollar Air Services, was doing pipeline
survey work for the British Gas corporation, flying at 500 feet,
when the observer spotted the supersonic Jaguar strike fighter
about 150 feet below it.
   The incident happened near Penrith in northwest England. The
Royal Air Force uses the remote area for low-level flying exercises.

   A Picasso sculpture stolen from an art
dealer has been recovered by police divers from a muddy river
bottom.
   The sculpture, one of two $5,000 works taken in thefts from
Bryant Galleries, was discolored and slightly marred from its stay
on the bottom of the Amite River, gallery owner Bryant Allen said
Tuesday.
   The other sculpture had been sold to a pawn shop for $50, police
said. They found the Picasso after acting on a tip that it had been
tossed from a bridge near McComb in southern Mississippi after
thieves learned police were on their trail.
   ``We consider this nothing short of a miracle. We took this on
as a challenge,'' said Don Bartlett, chief of detectives with the
Jackson Police Department.
   The gold-plated Picasso called La Femme, about 12 inches tall,
was taken March 5. The smaller sculpture, Sunol Alvar's bronze La
Paloma, disappeared on March 21.
   Police said no arrests had been made and the investigation was
continuing.

   Two family service workers fired for failing to
do their jobs properly have been indicted on misconduct charges in
connection with the murders of two babies whose homes they were
assigned to investigate.
   A Cook County grand jury handed up the indictments Tuesday
against Hattie Roland, 37, and Diane Henton, 35, former employees
of the Department of Children and Family Services.
   The indictments, said State's Attorney Richard M. Daley, should
serve as a notice to other caseworkers that ``we're going to be
looking at those records in order to protect all the children of
this county.''
   The two women worked in an office in which as many as eight
caseworkers had to be disciplined, said Gordon Johnson, director of
the department.
   ``I think we should have done a better job of administering that
office,'' he said. ``I'm not sure it would have saved the children,
but I would have been satisfied that we had done everything
possible.
   ``We transferred, terminated and suspended seven or eight
people,'' he added.
   Ms. Roland and Ms. Henton were fired by the agency last year
after an internal investigation.
   Ms. Roland was indicted on 63 counts of misconduct on grounds of
allegedly failing to file adequate reports, falsifying reports and
failing to provide child protection services, said Lisa Howard, a
spokeswoman for Daley's office.
   She is accused of lying about her visits to check on Debra
Hardy, a Chicago-area mother who was convicted of strangling her
4-month-old son, Ms. Howard said.
   According to the indictment, Ms. Roland said she had been in the
Hardy home on nine separate dates between Feb. 21, 1983, and June
21, 1984, when, in fact, she had never set foot in the house.
   Ms. Hardy was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years in
prison.
   Ms. Henton, who also supervised other caseworkers, was charged
with failing to report the abuse of Jonathan Campbell, who was
killed Jan. 25, 1986, on his first birthday.
   Anthony Habener, a friend of the child's mother, was convicted
of murder and sentenced to 65 years in prison.
   Ms. Howard said Ms. Henton visited the home on Jan 16, eight
days before Jonathan was killed, and closed the case two days later.
   An autopsy report showed the child's ears were nearly torn off
and that he had 25 or more bruises on his body, many at least 10
days old.
   Ms. Howard said the women face up to five years on each count of
misconduct if convicted of the charges.
   Ms. Roland appealed her firing to civil service officials, who
overturned the department ruling, Johnson said, but has not
returned to work pending the outcome of the indictments.

<TEXT>
   An oil well blew out today and spewed
natural gas into the air, forcing authorities to evacuate nearby
homes, officials said.
   No injuries were reported, but gas was hanging in the air and
the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said it might take 24 hours to cap the
well.
   ``We've got people on location and we have a plan to bring the
gas flow under control,'' said Jerry Jones, regional manager for
Apache Corp. of Tulsa, which operates the well.
   ``The gas flow to the surface needs some attention. There's not
been an ignition source to this point in time,'' he said.
   Central High School, a 12-grade school with about 350 students,
was in no danger from the blowout two miles away and was not being
evacuated, said Principal Larry Malcom.
   The oil well, known as Minnick 2-17, is five miles west of
Marlow.
   The highway patrol said it could not obtain an accurate count on
evacuations because most residents of homes near the well were at
work or in school.

<TEXT>
   Francis A. Keating II, recommended by Attorney
General Edwin Meese III as associate attorney general, has the
support of civil rights leaders in his home state despite his
membership in an all-white country club.
   Keating, currently an assistant Treasury secretary, is a member
of the Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla., club general
manager William Dorman said this week.
   Oklahoma leaders of the NAACP said Keating's membership in the
club does not affect their view that he's qualified for a high
position in the Justice Department.
   The Rev. Wade Watts, state executive director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the NAACP
has presented Keating with service awards in the past.
   ``Frank has always helped us,'' Watts said.
   Jim Wilson of Claremore, Okla., executive board member of the
state NAACP, said emphasis on Keating's Southern Hills membership
``kind of implies that he's a racist or a bigot and that's not
true.''
   ``I believe he's an honest and fair man,'' Wilson said. ``We in
the NAACP would love to see Frank Keating as the attorney general.''
   Keating is currently assistant Treasury secretary for
enforcement. Meese has recommended to the White House that he take
over the department's third-ranking position. He would succeed
Stephen Trott, who was confirmed as a federal appellate judge.

   Nine men were accused of sweeping into a
nomadic camp, tying up 15 men and hacking them to death in a
goat-rustling raid, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Wielding spears, rifles and machetes, the rustlers killed the
nomads and stole 2,500 goats in a March 30 raid near Garbatulla
about 320 miles north of Nairobi, according to the independent
Daily Nation.
   Police tracked down the nine suspects, all Kenyans of Somali
origin, earlier this month. The suspects denied the charges in
court Tuesday, and another hearing was set for April 26, the
newspaper said.
   Rustling of cattle and other animals is common among eastern
Africa's nomadic people.

   Princess Caroline of Monaco is here for a carefully
scripted visit sponsored by the Miami City Ballet, but not everyone
is happy about it. In fact, some chicken farmers are royally miffed.
   The miniflap drew a laugh from the princess today and a vow to
take the poultry people's side.
   The farmers began squawking when they found out the Hotel
Inter-Continental here is flying in 300 California-bred, free-range
chickens for the princess' gala supper and reception Thursday. She
arrived Tuesday.
   ``Lordy be. Whoever heard of importing free-range chickens from
California when we got great chickens that are raised right here in
Florida?'' asked Charles Womble, manager at Draper's Poultry in
Jacksonville. ``What's wrong with our chickens anyway?''
   Asked about the farmers' ruffled feathers today, a smiling
Princess Caroline responded: ``Of course, I'm very sad for the
Florida chicken producers. Now that I know it's not a Florida
chicken, I certainly won't touch it.''
   Many people believe a free-range chicken tastes better than one
grown in a controlled atmosphere because it is a ``happier chicken
that is allowed to exercise and eat whatever it wants,'' said
Florida Poultry Federation spokeswoman Valinda Parsons.
   But Womble doesn't believe a happier chicken is necessarily a
tastier chicken.
   ``Chickens that roam free will eat anything they can get their
beaks on and sometimes that means dirt or manure,'' said Womble.
``I hate to scare the princess but manure brings bacteria to a
chicken's stomach. Chicken growing in a controlled atmosphere on
the other hand are eating good, clean food.''
   The Miami City Ballet gala will raise money for Les Ballets de
Monte Carlo.

   The El Paso (Texas) Times on the income tax deadline:
   Why is midnight, April 15, the deadline for all income tax
returns?
   Remember the waits for state driver's licenses and vehicle
plates when every driver was required to get them by the same date.
Then someone proposed renewing licenses in the month of the
driver's birthday and plates in the month of the vehicle's original
purchase.
   Why can't that be done for income tax returns? Congress and the
Internal Revenue Service have made April 15 into National Trauma
Day. ...
   The U.S. Postal Service is overloaded, and overtime must be paid
to handle the crush of last-minute returns.
   Then, too, because of the single deadline, the IRS has hired
thousands of temporary workers, many of whom are giving faulty
answers to taxpayers. ...
   April 15 is a day dreaded by millions of people in this country.
It should not be. It would not be if the IRS and Congress would
figure out how to divide the taxpayers by 12 and make it a
year-round operation.

   Evening Express, Portland, Maine, on John Zaccaro Jr.'s cocaine
conviction:
   It was, perhaps, a typical mother's response to a son's
conviction on drug charges. She blamed herself, the police and
prosecutors.
   But this ``typical mother'' just happened to be a former
assistant district attorney, member of Congress and vice
presidential nominee: Geraldine Ferraro.
   At a news conference outside the Vermont District Court in
Rutland following her son John Zaccaro Jr.'s conviction for cocaine
peddling, Ferraro did fault her son for drug ``possession,'' but at
the same time blamed ``my candidacy for making my son a target.''
   She hinted that Vermont police ``set up'' her son because of her
role as the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984.
   Finally, Ferraro aimed her bitterest remarks at state prosecutor
John Quinn for rejecting a plea bargain arrangement. ...
   Ferraro's defensiveness about her son's drug-pushing may be
understandable in a loyal parent.
   But for someone who has served both as a lawmaker and a law
enforcer her attempts to pin the blame on others had a hollow and
self-serving ring.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon on Richard Nixon:
   Richard Nixon is at least consistent _ he still believes that
the presidency is an elected monarchy and all the president's
vassals should be pardoned from any crimes committed in service to
him.
   If President Reagan pardons (John M.) Poindexter and (Oliver L.)
North, he says to the country: ``I am the president. I am above the
law, and these men _ acting on what they thought were my directives
_ are above the law also.''
   It's unfortunate that Nixon learned so little from his forced
resignation in 1974. ...
   Almost 14 years after his departure from the Oval Office, Nixon
should understand by now the reason behind his fall from grace.

   The Baltimore Sun on trade trade-offs:
   The trade bill sluicing through Congress can be fairly compared
to raw sewage passing through a water treatment plant.
   At mid-stage in the process it is a good deal cleaner than when
it went in. But unless it is subjected to a lot more filtration, it
will not be fit for the law books.
   What President Reagan must guard against is the natural
inclination of Republican lawmakers to ``do something'' about
massive trade deficits lest they be clobbered by Democrats
preaching economic nationalism. ...
   As it stands now, Reagan should veto the trade bill. It dilutes
presidential authority by passing critical decisions affecting
relations with other nations to a cabinet-level trade
representative who could be badgered by Congress.
   And its disclosure provisions could scare off foreign investors
whose funds are needed to finance huge Reagan-era federal debts and
deficits.

   The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Wash., on drugs:
   There's an important lesson for Americans traveling abroad in
the story of a 23-year-old Virginia free-lance photographer who was
sentenced in Spain ... to six years and one day in prison, plus an
$18,083 fine, on a drug-trafficking charge.
   The photographer, who has been held without bail since he was
arrested a year ago, says he is innocent, that he thought the
suitcase he was transporting for a Washington, D.C., travel agency
on a four-day assignment requiring a flight from Chile to Spain was
filled with travel brochures, not cocaine.
   Even if he were only an unwitting drug courier, the
free-lancer's story underscores a message that the U.S. State
Department says American tourists should take to heart: Travel
abroad warrants caution. ...
   In many countries, people caught with drugs in their possession,
no matter how small the amount, can be assured of one thing: hefty
penalties that will make them think two or three times before
trying that again _ when they finally get out, that is.
   That is something this country should be emulating.

   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on air traffic controllers:
   The House vote to require the Reagan administration to rehire at
least 1,000 of the 11,400 air traffic controllers President Reagan
fired in 1981 presents the administration with a crucial decision:
Should the safety of the nation's air traffic control system have a
higher priority than the labor dispute that prompted the firings?
   Common sense says yes. ...
   The system is still operating with fewer controllers now than in
1981 _ roughly 15,500 compared with 16,375. Moreover, fewer of the
controllers now working are at the ``full performance level'' of
the most experienced and proficient controllers working in 1981.
   Meanwhile, there have been major increases in air traffic. The
Federal Aviation Administration argues that safety is not being
compromised and that it is adding more controllers into the system
gradually. ...
   The controllers were wrong to strike in violation of the law,
but that's no reason for the government to put the air traffic
system at risk by refusing to approve this bill.

concilatory moves in a conversation ... with Sen. Larry Pressler,

an ``interest section'' in the other's capital as a step toward
full diplomatic relations.

country of several thousand political prisoners released recently

Ballesteros:
   We doubt if many people were disturbed by the report of how
American drug agents used subterfuge and foreign police to arrest
an alleged international cocaine czar and bring him back to the
United States for trial.
   As a matter of fact, there are probably a lot of folks
applauding the federal drug agents' ability to get their hands on a
major drug suspect in Honduras, Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros.
   Defense lawyers and civil libertarians may throw up their arms
in dismay, but the U.S. courts agree with the opinion of most folks
_ how defendants got to the United States is not a legal concern if
no U.S. laws were broken.
   The practice of getting suspects from beyond our borders will
not prevent criminals from going about their business. But it sends
a message that the long arm of Uncle Sam can extend into foreign
countries.

   The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel on the plight of the homeless:
   Often the first step toward solving a problem is to achieve a
consensus on how serious it is. That's why it's encouraging to
learn from a new poll that 90 percent of Americans think the plight
of the homeless is ``a national disgrace.''
   The people interviewed also are concerned about the need to
rehabilitate low-income housing and provide down payment loans for
young families who can't buy homes without them.
   In fact, more than 60 percent of people questioned by the
National Housing Institute said they would be willing to pay $120 a
year in additional taxes if it would help solve our housing
problems.
   Enthusiasm for additional taxes tends to wane when hypothesis
turns to reality. But institute officials estimate an average tax
increase of that size would bring in between $12 billion and $17
billion a year.
   That would about double the shamefully little money the federal
government is putting into housing programs now.

   Anyone who thinks basketball isn't a contact sport didn't watch
the national collegiate basketball tournament or spend much time
watching the pros in the National Basketball Association this year.
   Bodies crash to the hardwood almost as frequently as they fall

   Sometimes, the rough stuff goes too far. The just-concluded
collegiate tourney ... didn't get out of hand, but during the
regular season several college games were interrupted by fights
between players. One player even threw a chair at a fan.
   In a welcome attempt to restrain the mayhem, new rules have been
adopted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. ...
   With the new NCAA rules, a uniform system of discipline has been
introduced into the game. ...
   Nevertheless, violence is as out of place in basketball as are
drugs and cheating. A round of applause to the NCAA for having
blown the whistle.

   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on the need to curb use of
chemical weapons:
   The altogether convincing evidence of hideous mass deaths
indicts Iraq once again for using chemical weapons in its war
against Iran.
   Incredibily, Iraq also committed a monstrous crime against
hundreds of its own people, Kurdish Iraqi civilians, in order to
use poison gas against Iranian troops occupying an Iraqi front-line
village, Halabaja. ...
   International horror over chemical warfare during World War I
led to the 1925 Geneva protocol, which banned the use of what
(Winston) Churchill called a ``hellish poison.''
   The dangerous turn in the Iran-Iraq war confirms the need for a
new international agreement that restates the prohibition against
chemical weapons, destroys existing stockpiles and provides a
credible international punishment for those who violate it.
   Meanwhile, Washington and Moscow should join in making it clear
to the (Persian) gulf combatants that the use of chemical warfare
will result in joint economic and military sanctions.

charges, though, of the sort that could be explained away _ and
probably are in hundreds of instances.
   True, a third charge of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan was
dismissed by the Arizona Senate because Mecham faces a criminal
trial on the charge.
   But the plain fact is that Mecham made America ridicule Arizona.
... Mecham offended blacks and Asians and gays. He put his foot in

   The Honolulu Advertiser on the Afghanistan accord:
   Mikhail Gorbachev can only gain now by a ``successful''
withdrawal from this adventure (in Afghanistan) that is both an
economic burden and at odds with Moscow's effort to change the
world's perception of its intentions.
   The ... plan, if it holds, comes in time to keep Afghanistan
from being a sticking point when Gorbachev and President Reagan
meet in Moscow May 29 to talk about reducing strategic nuclear arms.
   But the Soviet troop withdrawal to begin May 15 will likely be
followed by more bitter fighting and possibly efforts to partition
Afghanistan. The leader of the seven-party resistance has vowed to
make no peace with the Soviet-backed government in Kabul.
   By many assessments, that government will not last long. But the
Afghans are divided among themselves as to how to run their country.

   The Sun, Westerly, R.I., on trucks with idling engines:
   Anyone who has paused at a truck stop along the highways knows
the sound of parked behemoths. There they stand, sometimes 20 or so
_ giants muttering softly as their diesel engines are left idling
while the truckers go in for a coffee or a meal.
   There are reasons for this practice; the idling engines keep the
truck cab cool and warm, according to the season, and may also be
used to keep fuel warm for a ready departure.
   But Argonne National Laboratory researchers have taken some of
the fun out of it. A study reportedly shows that an hour of idling
causes as much engine wear as two hours of driving. The bad effects
are cumulative.
   The director of Argonne's Center for Transportation Research
offers this formulation: the average truck is left idling some 800
hours a year, equivalent to 64,000 miles on the road _ and that
requires an engine overall about a year sooner than would otherwise
be necessary.

   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on debates by the presidential
nominees:
   Vice President George Bush, the GOP's de facto presidential
candidate, may be trying to weasel out of debating his Democratic
opponent this fall.
   A Commission on Presidential Debates was established last year
by the chairmen of the Republican and Democratic parties to
coordinate the dates and places for the 1988 faceoffs.
   At the time, Bush staffers said it would be inappropriate for
Bush to make debate commitments until he bcomes the GOP nominee.
   Now, with the GOP nomination locked up, Bush's staff still won't
agree to a debate schedule and Bush himself won't discuss it.
   The question arises: what is Bush afraid to talk about?

<TEXT>
   President Reagan met Wednesday with Singapore
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, reported by an aide to be anxious for
the United States to maintain a strong role in Asia.
   Reagan greeted Lee at the White House for a 90-minute meeting
and lunch, which both sides indicated would cover a wide range of
issues including East-West relations.
   Lee does not want U.S.-Soviet summitry and superpower accords on
arms control and a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan to overshadow
the unsolved problem of Cambodia, said spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   Moscow-backed Vietnamese troops have occupied much of Cambodia
since 1978, the year after the Red Army entered Afghanistan.
   Lee already has conveyed his concerns to U.S. officials during
two days of talks that included meetings with Reagan's national
security adviser, Colin L. Powell, and Secretary of State George P.
Shultz.
   Lee was quoted by the aide as telling Shultz that if the Soviet
Union can withdraw from Afghanistan, there is no reason the
Vietnamese cannot pull out of Cambodia.
   Shultz briefed Lee about the Afghanistan withdrawal accords
which the United States will endorse in Geneva on Thursday, and the
two men also discussed the just-begun negotiations about the lease
of U.S. bases in the Philippines.
   Singapore would like to see a favorable outcome from the
negotiations in order to ensure a continued U.S. commitment to the
region to counter a growing Soviet presence.
   Lee' visit, which is described as a private one, also has
included meetings with members of Congress who complained about
Singapore's restrictions on foreign press coverage and about the
detention of suspected communist activists.

<HEAD>State Pays U.S. $2.4 Million For Polluting Harbor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts will pay the federal government $2.4
million for polluting Boston Harbor in a settlement reached after
years of negotiations, a top state official said today.
   The agreement marks a departure because $2 million of the total
will go to a special Boston Harbor cleanup fund, according to
William Geary, who heads the Metropolitan District Commission.
   Of the total amount, $425,000 will be paid as a fine to the U.S.
Treasury, Geary said.
   The settlement stems from a lawsuit that began in the mid-1980s
when environmentalists and lawyers representing the city of Quincy
sued the district commission for polluting the harbor. The
commission has wide authority over public services in the
metropolitan area.
   As part of the case, the state created the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority which took control of the harbor cleanup effort
and was granted power to bill sewer and water service customers.
   But negotiations between the state and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency continued over damages for pollution of Boston
Harbor, which state and federal officials say is the dirtiest in
the nation.
   ``Fortunately the commonwealth and the EPA have come to terms
with establishing a vision for the future in which we clean up the
harbor rather than dwelling on the past of how it got polluted,''
Geary said. ``The agreement closes that sad chapter.''
   Geary said $2 million of the money would go into a special
Harbor Trust to benefit harbor-related projects such as beach
restoration and protection of wildlife.

<HEAD>Jury Convicts Man in Newspaper Office Confrontation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has acquitted a man who shot up
the offices of the Anchorage Times of attempted murder, finding he
didn't intend to kill anyone, but convicted him of attempted
kidnapping and other charges.
   The defendant, Donald Ramsey, was upset with publisher Bob
Atwood because the Times refused to print a political advertisement
attacking Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, in October 1986, the
prosecution said.
   Ramsey stormed the newspaper office, threw a smoke grenade and
confronted Atwood and his daughter, Elaine. The Atwoods subdued
Ramsey and no one was injured seriously, although numerous shots
were fired.
   Atwood and several other people from the Times listened
impassively from the back of the courtroom as the verdicts were
announced Tuesday afternoon. Atwood, 81, said later he just wanted
to make sure Ramsey stayed in jail for awhile.
   ``My only concern has been if they found him not guilty and
turned him loose,'' he said. ``What position does that leave me in
... what are my options with him running around loose?''
   In addition to attempted kidnapping, the jury convicted Ramsey
of third-degree assault and reckless endangerment.
   In statements to investigators, Ramsey expressed great animosity
to Atwood. He said he believed the publisher and other political
figures were conspiring against him and were responsible for a fire
that destroyed his apartment.
   Defense attorney Craig Howard described Ramsey as a naive
political activist who ``just snapped'' when he found he couldn't
right wrongs by simply pointing them out to public officials.
   The attempted kidnapping conviction carries a recommended
seven-year prison term, but Assistant District Attorney Valerie Van
Brocklin said she might argue that Ramsey should get more because
of the unusually serious nature of his actions.
   Howard said he expected Superior Court Judge Mark Rowland would
give Ramsey a substantial sentence with lots of probation time
tacked on.

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender Michael
Dukakis said the United States must ``be prepared to use nuclear
force'' in the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe that could not
be halted with conventional forces, according to a newspaper report
published today.
   Dukakis said he could conceive of a scenario using nuclear
weapons against the Soviets in Europe.
   ``I don't think it's going to happen,'' he said in a meeting
with New York Daily News reporters and editors. But he added,
``We've got to be prepared to use nuclear force. Obviously with
great restraint, only when there seems to be no other alternative.''
   Dukakis' statement drew criticism from rival Albert Gore Jr.
that it was ``unwise and irresponsible.'' Gore said the comments
indicated the Massachusetts governor's lack of foreign policy
experience.
   But Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach disputed Gore, saying today
that ``Al Gore read the morning newspapers and started shooting.
And once again he got his facts wrong. Experienced leaders don't do
that. They check their facts before they act.''
   Dukakis also said he would order in the military if communist
forces crossed the West German border or the 38th parallel in Korea.
   Dukakis was back in Boston today attending to state business as
governor of Massachusetts, taking a break for part of the day from
the campaign for New York's important Democratic presidential
primary one week away.
   Vying with Gore for the support of Jews, who make up close to
one-fourth the Democratic voters in New York, Dukakis met privately
with Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish leaders in Brooklyn on Tuesday. He
emerged to address a large rally with people filling a city street
and received the strong endorsement of Rabbi Morris Shmidman and
the area's congressman, Rep. Stephen Solarz.
   Shmidman is executive director of th Council of Jewish
Organizations, a group representing 190 different Jewish
organizations.
   ``I know in my heart Michael Dukakis is the best choice, and I
will vote for him,'' the rabbi said. ``I urge you my friends to
follow me.''
   Dukakis praised the Jewish community warmly and drew analogies
with his own heritage as the son of Greek immigrants. But he did
not directly respond, if he heard them, to the repeated shouts from
some young people in the crowd pressing him for more detailed
answers on support for Israel and to draw distinctions with
Jackson, a candidate who has stirred strong opposition among some
Jewish leaders for past statements and associations.
   ``I have some disagreements with Rev. Jackson,'' Dukakis said.
``I have some disagreements with Sen. Gore. I'm going to run a
strong campaign that puts my best foot forward ... in the hope I
can win the support of the people of New York.''
   Dukakis met a day earlier with other Jewish leaders, following
by more than a week a similar appearance by Gore in which he struck
a strongly pro-Israel stance that has won him some support among
Jewish leaders. Meeting in a debate earlier in the day, Gore
suggested Dukakis had shown ``enthusiasm'' for creation of a
Palestinian state _ a move opposed by some Jewish leaders and which
Shmidman called ``a dagger at the heart and soul of Israel.''
   Responding to reporters surrounded by those at the rally,
Dukakis said that Israel must ``exercise maximum restraint'' in
dealing with Palestinian unrest in the West Bank and Gaza.
   Some in the crowd shouted to Dukakis, ``What about Jackson.''
Afterward, some in the crowd voiced only qualified support.
   ``He was very vague in regard to Israel,'' said Daniel Cohen, a
Hebrew teacher. ``I find him very hazy.''
   Yet several also voiced a concern often heard here _ that a vote
for Gore would in effect help Jackson in what is regarded as a
two-way race for the lead in New York with Dukakis.
   ``There is a fear of Jackson,'' Cohen said.
   Dukakis later campaigned at a rally with New York women,
repeating his commitment to providing basic health insurance for
all Americans. He was praised by a colleague, Vermont Gov.
Madeleine Kunin, who called him ``a candidate who not only gives
you rhetoric but gives you a record.''

   Seven major U.S. companies said Wednesday they've
joined forces with the Soviets to produce everything from crackers
to computer disks in a consortium that will market capitalist
products in a socialist economy.
   In addition, U.S. industrialist Armand Hammer announced a joint
venture under which he will build two plastics factories in the
Ukraine.
   U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity and a group of about
400 American business leaders are in Moscow this week for meetings
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials about
the possibility of expanding trade between the superpowers.
   Several agreements have been announced already, and the
businessmen say the climate for broader cooperation has warmed
considerably in recent months.
   James H. Giffen, president of the new American Trade Consortium
involving the seven companies, said this week's activity could lead
to an unprecedented volume of U.S.-Soviet trade.
   Giffen, who also is president of The Mercator Corp., attributed
the trade successes to ``the improved political atmosphere''
following Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to the United
States in December.
   Both governments began campaigning for expansion of commercial
ties after the Washington summit, the businessmen said.
   The Soviets are actively seeking joint business projects with
capitalist countries to help improve the quantity and quality of
consumer goods and to earn convertible foreign currencies to pay
for grain and other imports.
   Few U.S. companies had been able to put together joint ventures.
While there is huge demand among Soviets for consumer goods and
services, they have only rubles to spend, which cannot be converted
by the Western businesses seeking to take home their profits.
   But on Monday, Honeywell, Inc. announced a joint venture to
supply automated production controls for Soviet fertilizer
factories, and on Tuesday Roma Food Enterprises of Piscataway,
N.J., began selling pizza in Moscow from a mobile van.
   Hammer's $200 million plastics plant deal was the second joint
venture he has announced recently, and the companies forming the
new consortium claim their efforts will result in a network of
projects to make goods for both Soviet and foreign markets.
   ``This is not aid, this is trade,'' said Giffen. ``What we're
after is profit.''
   No joint-venture agreements have been completed by the
consortium yet, and Giffen declined to say how much they expect the
trade volume to be worth once the individual deals are put into
writing.
   RJR Nabisco vice chairman Robert J. Carbonell said his company
is negotiating with the Kremlin to produce cookies and crackers,
breakfast cereals and cigarettes in the Soviet Union, and Ford
Motor Company vice president Alexander J. Trotman said his company
is talking about producing cars, light trucks and parts at Soviet
plants.
   By forming a consortium, the businesses are effectively matching
the Soviet bureaucracy, which groups various government industries
and agencies together to put together joint ventures with foreign
firms. But the consortium arrangement also gives the companies more
flexibility in financing their projects.
   Because Soviet rubles are not convertible, foreign companies
entering into ventures with the Soviets have to devise ways of
either earning hard currency or taking their share of the proceeds
out in Soviet commodities.
   Giffen confirmed that by pooling the individual joint ventures
under one umbrella, some of the deals could produce goods solely
for the Soviet market but take out hard-currency profits from the
export sales of the other companies.
   He declined to give details of the financing arrangements until
the joint ventures are signed.
   ``There are difficulties for American and other Western
countries to interface with planned economy countries,'' Giffen
said. ``What we've tried to set up is a mechanism that will allow
them to interface.''
   Complex regulations on joint ventures were introduced by the
Soviets last year and revised several times. But most Western
businesses that have signed joint-venture agreements have
negotiated separate, unique deals that allow them to repatriate
their profits.
   The New Jersey pizza company plans to use its ruble income to
buy commodities like mushrooms that it can use or sell abroad.
   Hammer, who has had business dealings with the Kremlin since the
1920s, told reporters he's convinced the Soviet Union ``is
committed to making joint ventures succeed.''
   He said the two plastics plants his Occidental Petroleum Corp.
will have in operation by 1991 would help improve the supply of
consumer goods to the Soviet public.
   ``If socialism is to succeed in Russia, you must improve the
standard of living of your people,'' Hammer told Alexander
Ustkachkinzev, first deputy minister of the Soviet Chemical
Industry, after signing the agreement.
   Hammer announced in November that Occidental Petroleum, Italian
and Japanese companies would participate in another joint venture
to build a petrochemical complex near the Caspian Sea.
   Other projects in the negotiation stage under the consortium
include an Eastman Kodak Co. plan to help the Soviets produce
clinical chemicals for blood analysis and manufacture of magnetic
computer products.
   William D. Dearstyne of Johnson and Johnson said talks are under
way with his company on projects that would have Soviets producing
their brand-name pharmaceuticals, personal care items and
disposable hospital products.
   The other companies taking part in the consortium are Chevron
Overseas Petroleum Inc., which has been talking with the Soviet
ministries overseeing geology and oil production, and Archer
Daniels Midland Co., looking into commodity production
opportunities.

   Indian troops repulsed a Pakistani assault there in September,

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrialist Jon Huntsman abruptly
dropped his front-running quest for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination today, citing business reasons and a need for party
unity.
   Huntsman's decision came one day before he was to formally
announce his candidacy for governor and 30 days after he had said
he was seeking to wrest the party's nomination from Gov. Norm
Bangerter.
   ``The building of our economy is and will be far more important
to me than the actual title of governor,'' Huntsman said in a brief
statement at Huntsman Chemical Corp headquarters. He said a recent
business trip to Asia presented unexpected opportunities to expand
his $1 billion-per-year chemicals empire.
   Without specifically naming tax-cutting independent
gubernatorial candidate Merrill Cook, a Republican, Huntsman called
on independents to unite behind Bangerter.
   Huntsman had already shocked Republicans once with his
announcement last month that he would challenge Bangerter, who was
trailing Democratic challenger Ted Wilson in polls, for the GOP
nomination.
   A long-time player behind the scenes in the state Republican
Party, Huntsman quickly gathered major support for his candidacy
from major party figures and launched a $236,000 television and
radio campaign on Saturday.
   Without specifically naming tax-cutting independent
gubernatorial candidate Merrill Cook, a Republican, Huntsman called
on independents to unite behind Bangerter.
   Bangerter, who also attended the news conference, said there
were no conditions set by either man for the withdrawal. Bangerter
said he would draw heavily on Huntsman's expertise to bolster the
state's economic development.
   Huntsman supporters ``certainly have nothing to be ashamed of
and have nothing to fear from Norm Bangerter,'' the governor said.
   Huntsman's decision came three days after a poll in The Salt
Lake Tribune showed the challenger had widened his lead over the
first-term governor. The poll by Bardsley, Hardison & Neidhart
found Huntsman with a 48 percent to 40 percent lead, although the
telephone survey had an error margin of 7 percent.
   Wilson, the former mayor of Salt Lake City, said it was
difficult to assess the impact of Huntsman's decision.
   However, he said, ``We're encouraged. We think this does help
our chances. It allows us to go out and take full command of the
jobs issue.''
   Huntsman, 50, former presidential aide and founder of a
chemicals empire with annual sales of $1 billion, had personally
loaned his campaign $100,000 while awaiting arrival of some
$200,000 in pledges made the day after his March 15 announcement.
   The 30-day campaign was Huntsman's first quest for public
office, but he has been a force in the state GOP for more than a
decade. His fund-raising skills, personal wealth and Washingtn
connections left a number of Republicans in his debt.
   He is presently Utah finance chairman for Vice President George
Bush's presidential campaign.
   In 1980, the GOP nomination to challenge popular Democratic Gov.
Scott Matheson was virtually assured Huntsman, but he declined,
saying a campaign would not allow him enough time with his wife and
nine children.
   His transformation from supporter to opponent was a bitter blow
to Bangerter, who scored Huntsman for a lack of loyalty. Bangerter
was deserted by several people who withdrew endorsements and
switched to Huntsman.
   For 12 months during 1971 and 1972, Huntsman served as a special
assistant to President Richard Nixon.
   A graduate of the Wharton School of Finance at the University of
Pennsylvania, Huntsman founded Huntsman Container Corp. in 1970.
Huntsman Container focused on food packaging, and the firm's
accomplishments included the invention of a styrofoam container for
Big Mac hamburgers.
   In 1982 he formed Huntsman Chemical Corp. The company's major
product is bulk polystyrene and other plastics derived from
petroleum by-products.

   Sweden's royal couple today re-enacted
the landing of the first Swedish settlers in America as they rode a
boat up the Christina River as part of the city's 350th anniversary
celebration.
   King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia arrived shortly before 9
a.m. to a cheering crowd of about 1,500 and greetings from Gov.
Michael N. Castle, Mayor Daniel Frawley and Rep. Thomas R. Carper,
D-Del.
   ``Today, most Americans don't know that the Swedish were among
the first Europeans to colonize North America,'' the king said. ``I
hope that this year of New Sweden will help us focus America's
attention on our common history and significant contributions made
by Swedes to the progress and development of this great country.''
   He called the landing in Wilmington the high point of the royal
couple's 15-city U.S. tour that began Sunday in Washington.
   The king and queen also dedicated an exhibit of artifacts found
in the wreckage of the Swedish 17th century warship Kronan.
   Carl Gustaf said he was impressed by the exhibit. He has dived
to the wreckage over the past several summers and said artifacts
found so far represent just a part of the bounty.
   ``There is a statue of natural size in nearly perfect condition.
That means there is a lot more to be found, hopefully,'' the king
said.
   Prior to the royal couple's arrival, the Afro-American
Historical Society of Delaware dedicated a plaque commemorating the
arrival of the state's first black settler, who was a slave aboard
one of the ships bringing the Swedish settlers.
   Following the morning stop in Wilmington, the king and queen
traveled to Philadelphia to open an exhibit at the American-Swedish
Historical Museum. They are scheduled to return to Wilmington for a
reception and dinner tonight.
   Lone Bear, a descendant of the Lenni Lenape Indians from the
area, was among those greeting the king, giving him a buckskin
hunter's bag, a beaver pelt and tobacco. A thousand people had
lunch with the royal couple under a tent outside the museum.
   On Tuesday, the royal couple opened an exhibit at Washington's
National Gallery that serves as the centerpiece of a nationwide
celebration of ``The Year of New Sweden.''

<HEAD>Easter Buying Helps Boost Retail Sales in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales rose a healthy 0.8 percent in
March, the government reported Wednesday, propelled by Easter
buying at department and food stores.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales for the month
increased by a seasonally adjusted $1.1 billion to $130.7 billion.
   It was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the largest
since December, when sales shot up 1.1 percent. Revised figures
showed sales rose 0.6 percent in February and 0.1 percent in
January.
   Ever since the October stock market crash, economists have
watched retail sales closely for signs that the consumer sector of
the economy would weaken. But more recently, some analysts have
raised fears that too much consumer demand could rekindle inflation.
   ``If consumer spending were sustained at the March pace for
several months to come, we would probably be heading (toward)
higher inflation and higher interest rates,'' said Bruce Steinberg,
senior economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. However, he
said growth in retail spending will likely slacken in April and May.
   ``The consumer was feeling good about spending in March, but
that doesn't indicate that a new consumer boom is in the making,''
Steinberg said.
   Economists had predicted only a 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent gain
in March. They said Wednesday that because Easter fell on April 3,
earlier in the year than usual, more people may have shopped for
the holiday in March than normally.
   Sales at department and other general merchandise stores rose
1.6 percent, after suffering a steep 2.6 percent drop in February.
   Sales at food stores rose 1.1 percent, following a 0.6 percent
decline the month before.
   ``The increase at department stores is definitely
Easter-related,'' said James Newton, an economist with Economic
Perspectives Inc., a Delaware, Ohio, consulting firm. He said the
increase at food stores ``might also be a bit Easter-related.''
   March sales increased in all categories execept furniture and
restaurants, in contrast to the first two months of the year, when
overall sales growth was spurred by auto sales.
   ``The strength in retail sales had been largely in autos,'' said
Scott Hoyt, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting firm. ``Now we're seeing it across the board,
indicating somewhat broader strength.''
   Auto sales rose 0.9 percent in March. Excluding autos, sales
were up 0.8 percent, the same as the overall rise.
   In February and January, car sales were much stronger than other
sales. They rose 2 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while
other sales increased only 0.2 percent in February and declined 0.6
percent in January.
   Sales of all durable goods _ items expected to last three or
more years _ were up 0.5 percent in March, while non-durable goods
were up 1 percent.
   The department offered these details of March sales:
   _Hardware and garden supply stores, up 0.5 percent after soaring
3.0 percent in February.
   _Furniture and appliance stores, down 2 percent after a strong
2.9 percent increase a month earlier.
   _Gasoline, up 1.4 percent following a 1.2 percent decline.
   _Specialty clothing stores, up 0.3 percent; restaurants and
bars, down 0.6 percent; and drug stores, up 1.6 percent.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo heaped praise on
Jesse Jackson today as ``a singularly important Democrat'' who
could win for the party in November. Jackson thanked Cuomo for not
endorsing any of the presidential candidates.
   ``He is making this race a manifestation of the American idea at
its very best,'' said Cuomo during a late morning news conference
with Jackson.
   While Cuomo held to his pledge not to endorse any of the three
Democratic candidates before the end of the primary season on June
7, Jackson said that was fine with him.
   ``Governor Cuomo, just keep a freeze on all endorsements and
keep extending your support,'' the candidate told the New York
governor as Jackson supporters cheered.
   Jackson met with Cuomo for about a half hour this morning
following a speech at a $100 per person breakfast fundraiser for
about 200 people in Albany.
   In his introduction of Jackson, Cuomo said the candidate was
suffering from the ``dumb blonde syndrome'' in which potential
voters think that if a candidate demonstrates charisma and passion
there is little else. ``Nothing could be further from the truth,''
Cuomo said of Jackson. Cuomo, an eloquent political speaker, has
said he suffers from the same put-down.
   Cuomo told Jackson that the fact ``you can get to be president,
or so close, that they put your face on the front page of national
magazines just to explain this phenomenon; that is extraordinary
progress.''
   For his part, Jackson said he felt it was ``a wise use of
power'' for Cuomo to hold off backing any candidate until after the
primaries. Jackson said the move would encourage more people to
vote.

   A man who says he prayed to a saint for help in
picking the winning numbers on a Lotto ticket has won a seven-year
legal battle for half of the $2.8 million prize.
   Christopher Pando, 24, said he and the ticket's holder, Daysi
Fernandez, had agreed to split any winnings, and a jury decided
Tuesday after a seven-day trial that he was telling the truth.
   ``I believed in justice and I finally got it,'' said Pando, who
is unemployed.
   Pando is entitled to $1.4 million plus ``a couple hundred
thousand dollars'' interest that has accumulated on the money since
it was placed in escrow, said his lawyer, Joseph Ettinger.
   Pando testified that he prayed to St. Elegua, who told him which
numbers to play on four Lotto tickets he bought for Ms. Fernandez
in June 1981.
   One of the tickets won. At the time, the $2.8 million prize,
paid in annual installments over 10 years, was the state-run game's
biggest payout.
   Initially, Justice Edward Greenfield dismissed the case, saying
it could not be proved that St. Elegua had given Pando the numbers.
But the judge was reversed on appeal, with the higher court saying
that this was not the issue; that it was whether Pando and Ms.
Fernandez had an oral agreement.
   Ms. Fernandez, 44, a mother of three who had been on welfare
about 10 years when she won, said they never had such a deal.
   In the five years after she won, Ms. Fernandez collected about
half of the prize at about $267,720 a year. In July 1986, Pando won
a court order stopping further payments until the case was
resolved. She will receive any money remaining from her half of the
prize.
   When the verdict was announced, Ms. Fernandez wept, Ettinger
said.

   Albert Gore Jr. today accused fellow Democratic candidate
Michael Dukakis of making ``unwise and irresponsible'' comments
about a U.S. nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Dukakis'
spokesman called Gore's remarks ``a desperate move.''
   Rival Jesse Jackson met with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who
declined to endorse him but did say he was ``a singularly important
Democrat'' who could win for the party in November.
   Jackson, who appeared with Cuomo at a news conference in Albany,
N.Y., said, ``Governor Cuomo, just keep a freeze on all
endorsements and keep extending your support.''
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush was winding
up an easy-does-it campaign swing in New York.
   All three of the remaining major Democratic presidential
candidates were campaigning in the state, six days before its big
primary with 255 national convention delegates at stake.
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, in an interview published in today's
New York Daily News, said he could envision using nuclear weapons
if the Soviets invaded Europe and conventional weapons failed to
stop them.
   ``I don't think it's going to happen,'' he said. But ``we've got
to be prepared to use nuclear force. Obviously with great
restraint, only when there seems to be no other alternative.''
   Gore, at a breakfast with corporate executives on Long Island,
characterized Dukakis' comments as saying ``he would launch a
nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union if they invaded
Europe with conventional forces.''
   He said presidents and candidates for the office traditionally
have avoided ``the trap of spelling out in advance when the United
States of America would use the awesome power contained in our
nuclear arsenal.''
   Later, to reporters, Gore said, ``Governor Dukakis made a
significant mistake ... that's unwise and irresponsible.''
   Dukakis' communications director, Leslie Dach, said in an
interview, ``Today Al Gore read the morning newspapers and started
shooting, and once again he got his facts wrong. Experienced
leaders don't do that. They check their facts before they act. Al
Gore's action today is a desperate move for a candidate and a
dangerous move for a president.''
   Gore also criticized Jackson for what he said was Jackson's
comment several years ago that ``he would unilaterally halt
deployment'' of missiles in Europe.
   The three Democrats met Tuesday in the first of four debates
preceding next Tuesday's New York primary. Bush, meanwhile, threw
out the ball at the start of a New York Mets baseball game and
talked of campaigning against ``the ghost of Jimmy Carter.''
   The debate featured several sharp exchanges between Dukakis, the
Democratic front-runner, and Gore, the Tennessee senator who needs
a strong New York showing to revive his candidacy.
   At one point, Gore declared that Dukakis had sounded a note of
``enthusiasm'' about an independent Palestinian state. Gore also
criticized Jackson on the same issue, saying he disagreed ``with
the way Jesse Jackson advocates a Palestinian state.''
   Dukakis retorted that Gore was just plain wrong. ``I didn't
express enthusiasm for a Palestinian state yesterday,'' he said.
   For his part, Jackson did not back down from his support for a
Palestinian homeland: ``While we can guarantee secure borders, we
cannot ensure tranquility so long as there is occupation.''
   Gore and Dukakis have been courting Jewish voters while Jackson
has been trying to mend fences with them. They traditionally make
up a quarter of the turnout in New York Democratic primaries.
   On Tuesday in the AP delegate count, Dukakis had 750.15 votes;
Jackson, 713.1; Gore, 396.8 and uncommitted, 506.7.
   Bush rubbed elbows with the rich and famous, attending a
$1,000-a-plate fund-raiser in New York City put on by wealthy
developer Donald Trump. Bush also struck a presidential pose by
tossing out the first baseball at a Mets game.
   Today he was going after the black vote while visiting a public
school in East Harlem before campaign trips stops in Buffalo and
Rochester.
   Bush said in a speech in Syracuse that he had no problem
``running against the ghost of Jimmy Carter.''
   ``Do you want Americans to go back to those terrible days of
malaise and darkness?'' he asked.
   Explaining to reporters why he was campaigning against Carter,
who left office in 1981, Bush said it was ``because the policies of
the Democrats will take us right back to the high interest rates
and the double-digit inflation of the Carter years.''
   Bush also said he hopes indicted former White House aides John
Poindexter and Oliver North are exonerated in the Iran-Contra
affair, but he refused to say whether he would pardon either if he
became president.
   ``A pardon imputes guilt,'' he said. ``And the American system
after all is `innocent until proven guilty.'''
   ``I'm not going to get into that,'' he added. ``If I had to face
that at some time, then I'll keep my own counsel and make my own
decision.''
   All the candidates were pulling out their advertising guns, with
Jackson spending a record amount for his campaign _ $500,000 _ and
running an anti-drug advertisement produced by filmmaker Spike Lee.
   Dukakis, who previously had said he was running two ads,
unveiled a third ad, also against drugs. The ad also had a
foreign-policy twist, attacking the Reagan administration for its
previous support of Panamanian military strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega.

   President Reagan told young business
executives Wednesday they should work to keep the White House in
Republican hands this fall if they want to protect their interests.
   Reagan did not make a direct pitch for Vice President George
Bush, who is expected to be the GOP's presidential nominee, but did
say the election could determine whether there is a healthy
business climate.
   ``And I want to ask you to become active and involved this year,
because the stakes are too high and the choice too clear for it to
be left up to others,'' Reagan said.
   Speaking to members of the Young Presidents Organization in the
Old Executive Office Building, Reagan said that ``if the policies
under which your companies have flourished are reversed, how could
your company's bottom line not suffer?''
   ``We cannot afford to have American businessmen once again
treated like a bunch of hired hands laboring on the federal farm,''
he said, ``where the folks in Washington act as if what you produce
belongs to them.''
   Reagan said that under his leadership, the nation has entered
the 65th month of recovery from the 1981-82 recession, the longest
peacetime expansion, and said nearly 16 million jobs have been
created during this period.
   ``It's no coincidence that while we've held down the rate of
growth in government, the private economy has been booming,'' he
said. ``Real GNP (gross national product) grew by nearly 5 percent
in the fourth quarter last year, and inflation remains low.''
   Without singling out any of the Democratic candidates for
president, Reagan made clear he does not believe any of them would
create conditions favorable to businesses.
   ``America will face choices this fall that will determine what
lies ahead for American business and the economy,'' he said. ``If
we can continue the pro-growth policies of the last seven years, I
believe that the next decade will be known as the roarin' '90s.''
   ``The choice we face is a very simple one: Is the federal
government going to grow or is your business going to grow?''
   Reagan has remained neutral in the Republican Party presidential
sweepstakes, although it has been increasingly clear he favors
Bush. Presidential aides have said that Reagan likely will be
actively involved in the general election campaign.

   A gun-wielding man barricaded himself for
about 12 hours in a store before being shot to death by state
police in a gun battle as he tried to get away, officials said
today.
   ``Officers tried to talk him out; it was a long, ongoing
thing,'' said state police Sgt. Gilbert Studinger in Manistique, on
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. ``Finally he did come out, but he was
armed and tried to make an escape.
   ``He came out and was firing at the officers, and they returned
fire, and in the process he was killed.''
   Studinger identified the man as John Gillespie, 39, who recently
moved into an apartment attached to The Corner Store, where the
standoff occurred. Gillespie was a store employee and was the only
person there when the standoff began about 8 p.m. Tuesday, police
said.
   Studinger said he did not know how many shots had been fired.
   Studinger said the man may have been distraught over a recent
fight with his girlfriend, who also worked at the store.

   Algerian officials today boarded a
hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet and began negotiations with Shiite
Moslem gunmen who killed two people and were holding about 35
others hostage.
   A delegation of Kuwaiti officials arrived in Algiers to help in
the effort to free the plane, which was hijacked April 5 on a
flight from Bangkok to Kuwait with 112 people aboard. The Boeing
747 left Larnaca, Cyprus, Tuesday night after 12 more hostages were
freed and flew to Algiers.
   Fifty-seven others were released earlier when the plane was on
the ground in Mashhad, northeastern Iran.
   The hijackers are demanding that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranian
extremists convicted in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French
embassies in Kuwait. Kuwait has rejected the demand.
   One of the 12 freed passengers said the gunmen got new weapons
when the plane was in Mashhad. Ramadan Ali, who holds dual
U.S.-Egyptian citizenship, spoke in an interview in Larnaca with
NBC-TV's ``Today.''
   ``They changed the crew, you know, their team,'' said Ali. ``One
of them left ... and another two guys came over ... and they
provided them with new weapons ... and bombs ... and ropes ... and
explosives.''
   Ali said he hid his U.S. passport in his briefcase while on the
plane.
   Adnan Rashi Majiki, a Kuwaiti passenger in his 60s who was one
of the 12 released in Larnaca, told The Associated Press that the
hijackers ``were six but I think in Mashhad they became seven.''
   A Kuwait newspaper reported today that one hijacker was believed
to have boarded the plane in Mashhad.
   Algerian Interior Minister Hedi Khediri visited the Kuwaiti
Airways jet twice and told reporters he was assured the gunmen
would ``use no violence'' on Algerian territory.
   Later, an Algerian army officer, identified only as Col.
Bechine, met with the hijackers on the plane for about a half-hour.
No details of the meeting were available.
   Three members of the Kuwaiti royal family remain aboard the
jumbo jet.
   Khediri said he had seen five or six hijackers, but did not know
the exact number.
   Mohammed Saud Al-Osaimi, a Kuwaiti deputy foreign minister, and
nine other government officials arrived today. ``I hope this will
be the last stage of the voyage,'' Al-Osaimi told reporters.
   Kuwait newspapers quoted PLO chairman Yasser Arafat as saying he
doubted Algeria would be the last stop for the captive jumbo jet.
   ``I don't think this operation will come to an end in Algiers,''
Arafat said, according to the Al Watan daily.
   In an interview with Cable Network News, Arafat blamed Iran for
the hijacking. When asked who was involved, Arafat said: ``Some of
them are Lebanese. Some of them belong to the Iranian government.
   ``According to my best information, they (the Iranians) are
behind the whole operation,'' Arafat said in a telephone interview
from North Yemen.
   The PLO was involved in negotiations to try to end the crisis.
   Asked if the hijackers still planned to kill hostages as they
have threatened, Khediri said: ``I cannot answer this question
because doing so would complicate my efforts and could even
compromise them.''
   He said the passengers were in good condition. The hijackers are
armed with grenades and guns.
   ``I believe they (the hijackers) know what they are doing. They
gave me the impression of being extremely determined,'' he said.
   Some of the freed hostages said they were treated well during
eight days in captivity and did not know their captors had killed
two passengers.
   ``We were not beaten. We were not harassed. They treated us very
nicely,'' said Sherif Mahbojh Badrawi said, a Cairo-based ticketing
agent for Kuwait Airways. Badrawi and other passengers spoke to
reporters in Larnaca General Hospital.
   Mohammed Kamel Sayyid Rehan, a 32-year-old Egyptian who works as
a caterer for the airline, said none of the passengers was aware of
the killings.
   The blue and white jet, which the gunmen have called the ``plane
of martyrdom,'' landed in Algiers at 3:07 a.m. today (10:07 p.m.
EDT Tuesday) after sitting for five days in the Larnaca airport.
   Algeria's official APS news agency said talks between the
hijackers and Algerian authorities began about two hours later. The
plane is isolated on the tarmac of Houari Boumedienne airport 400
yards from the terminal.
   Khediri was reportedly accompanied by Transport Minister Rachid
Benyelles and the head of state security, Abdelmadjid Bouzbid.
   The independent Kuwaiti daily al-Qabas today quoted unidentified
sources as saying that ``Imad Mughniyeh, the No. 1 man in planning
and implementing hijackings and explosions in Lebanon and Europe''
is believed to have boarded the jetliner at Mashhad.
   It quoted sources as saying they believed the 36-year-old
Mughniyeh, who was born in the south Lebanese village of Dair Daba,
commanded the operation personally because one of the convicted 17
in Kuwait is related to his wife.
   Two men identified as Kuwaitis were killed on Saturday and
Monday and their bodies dumped on the tarmac.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 U.S. Marines engaged in a
two-hour firefight with about 40 unidentified intruders at a
military fuel tank farm in a jungle area, a U.S. military spokesman
said today.
   Col. Ron Sconyers, chief public affairs officer for the U.S.
Southern Command, told a news conference there were no apparent
injuries on either side in Tuesday night's fighting. It was the
second reported incident of its kind in two days at the tank farm
in Howard Air Force Base, near Panama City.
   The firefight took place at the Arriajan Tank Farm, an 800-acre
depot where a Marine was shot and killed Monday night while
investigating what U.S. officials called a suspected break-in by
six to eight camouflaged men.
   A Defense Department spokesman in Washington said the victim
appeared to have been shot accidentally by fellow Marine guards,
but suggested the incident was sparked by the intrusion of
Panamanian military personnel.
   The Panamanian government said the statement was ``totally false
and stupid'' and aimed at justifying ``a military intervention.''
   Sconyers said a 12-man Marine patrol reported receiving fire at
about 7:35 p.m. EDT Tuesday from a location where they had observed
between 40 and 50 ``unauthorized personnel.''
   ``The Marines returned the fire. Sporadic firing continued for
about two hours,'' Sconyers said.
   Sconyers said the Marine patrol summoned reinforcements, who
engaged the intruders in small arms fire followed by three high
explosive mortar rounds at their suspected positions and
illuminated the area with aerial flares.
   Sconyers said the intruders were wearing dark uniforms and ``had
some kind of military hats,'' but declined to identify them as
members of the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   ``I can neither confirm nor deny that they were PDF,'' he said.
   On Monday night, a U.S. Marine, Cpl. Ricardo M. Villahermosa,
25, was killed while investigating a suspected break-in at the
storage depot.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said Tuesday that Villahermosa
apparently was shot accidentally by fellow Marine guards, but added
there had been a series of intrusions at the base in recent weeks
by ``individuals who were uniformed and camouflaged.''
   About two hours after the fighting Tuesday, most of Panama City
was plunged into darkness by an apparently unrelated power failure.
   Earlier, another Southern Command spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Doug
Schamp, told reporters there was ``no reason at all at this time''
to suspect Panamanian military involvement in Monday's shooting
incident.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's de facto leader and
head of its 15,000-strong Defense Forces, has so far successfully
defied U.S. efforts to force him out of office.
   The Reagan administration imposed economic sanctions on Panama
after Noriega was indicted on U.S. drug trafficking charges in
February. Panama's banks have been closed for more than a month and
the economy is in a shambles, but Noriega has maintained power.
   In a statement Tuesday night, the Defense Forces public
relations director, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, called Howard's suggestion
``totally false and stupid.
   Another Panamanian military spokesman, Maj. Daniel Delgado
Diamante, later called Howard's comments ``an act of provocation''
aimed at justifying ``an aggression against our territory, our
people.''
   Schamp said there have been numerous intrusions in the area over
the years, the most recent by a poacher caught with two dead
animals last week.
   Villahermosa, of Santurce, Puerto Rico, was one of nearly 2,000
Marines and Army personnel sent to Panama in the past few weeks to
step up security for the Panama Canal, other U.S. installations and
American citizens.
   Officials said he was a member of I Company, 3rd Battalion, 4th
Marine Regiment of Camp LeJuene, N.C. and had arrived just a week
ago.
   Sconyers said Villahermosa was part of a 12-man Marine patrol at
the depot.
   The Southern Command and the Pentagon issued identical
statements saying the shooting Monday ``occurred after an apparent
intrusion by six or eight individuals into the tank farm area.''
   Sconyers said the Marine had been shot in the stomach and died
from massive internal bleeding. The Pentagon said the incident was
under investigation.

   As China's legislature on Wednesday ended what
has been officially described as its most democratic session ever,
there was one enlightening and slightly embarrassing moment.
   The presiding official, Xi Zhongxun, introduced a measure for
passage and asked for comment, but there was none.
   ``Approved,'' he declared without waiting for the usual
formality of a show of hands. A titter went through the massive
Great Hall of the People.
   ``Habit,'' murmured one Chinese reporter.
   China will have to shake off many habits bred during more than
2,000 years of imperial rule and nearly 40 years of communist
authoritarianism if it is to become democratic.
   Many Chinese do not believe such a drastic change is possible,
or even entirely desirable.
   ``It's only a matter of form,'' said one college student.
``Talking about real democracy in China is out of the question.''
   The top leaders have stressed that they don't intend to
relinquish the Communist Party's leading role. Instead, as the
National People's Congress Chairman Wan Li told the congress'
closing session, the goal is to ``fully arouse the people's
enthusiasm for socialism'' and the huge task of modernizing China's
largely peasant economy.
   Wan used the word democracy 17 times in the 10-minute address.
   During the 20-day congress, delegates spoke out more frankly on
China's economic and social problems than at any previous session.
State-run newspapers published letters and phone calls from
non-delegates commenting on the proceedings, also with rare
frankness.
   The delegates and letter writers complained about inflation, too
little money for education, the need for roads or other projects in
their home regions and official corruption. Some suggested that
many leaders talk a good line but don't do much to correct problems.
   The number of letters sent to the congress _ 460,000 by Sunday _
and the number of dissenting votes cast in approving congress
reports and new laws have been publicized as evidence that China is
becoming more democratic.
   The number of votes opposing the election of various officials
was not officially released, but unofficial reports said as many as
500 of the 2,970 delegates opposed some Communist Party-selected
candidates.
   ``What has now been achieved in this respect would have been
utterly unthinkable 10 years ago,'' the English-language China
Daily said in an editorial typical of those published in the state
media in recent days.
   Ordinary Chinese wonder how long this passion for criticism will
go on, and how far.
   ``If people were to become really active, I'm afraid the leaders
would have to strengthen their control,'' said a college student.
   Older Chinese remember the 1956 Hundred Flowers movement, during
which intellectuals were encouraged to speak frankly and then were
punished.
   Wait and see what happens to those who speak out now, cautioned
a man peddling a cart.
   Fear and a sense of futility will make it difficult for the
frankness movement to filter down to ordinary people.
   The vast majority of Chinese follow politics chiefly to know
which way to duck when the next change comes, not to formulate
opinions of their own.
   ``Most Chinese don't get very excited about things since the
Cultural Revolution,'' said one apolitical young man, referring to
the 1966-76 far leftist campaign to end all political campaigns,
during which hundreds of thousands of people were purged.
   Of more than a dozen Chinese interviewed on the street, not one
believed his opinion could have an affect on government action.
   ``The congress and the laobaixing _ the ordinary people _ are
two different things,'' said one man.
   Asked if the congress delegate from his district had accurately
conveyed local people's concerns, he said, ``We don't have a
representative,'' then qualified it. ``I don't know my delegate.''
   ``Right now the ordinary people are worried about prices and the
standard of living,'' said a woman.
   But China badly needs to inspire its people to hard work if it
is to reach its goal of doubling the gross national product by the
year 2000.
   So far, wage bonuses for increased production have inspired many
Chinese to work harder, but leaders caution that not everyone will
be able to get rich, and inflation will continue to eat at the
gains. Non-material incentives are needed to revive the jaded
populace, and a dose of democracy may be senior leader Deng
Xiaoping's pragmatic prescription.
   Still unclear is whether it will work, or whether it will work
too well and raise expectations for democracy beyond what the
leadership plans to deliver.
   ``Chinese citizens are free to express their opinion,'' Premier
Li Peng told a news conference Wednesday, but he added, ``within
the scope of the law and regulations set by local governments.''

<HEAD>Man Says He Helped Friend With ARC Commit Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An AIDS counselor who claimed in a television
interview that he helped a patient commit suicide did not tell
sheriff's investigators about his role in the death, authorities
said.
   AIDS counselor Marty James told a national television audience
on March 31 that he helped Keith Lower take his own life.
   ``He had lived a very good life and he wanted a very good
death,'' James said on ABC-TV's ``Nightline.'' ``There were no
convulsions, no discomfort that I could see. It was quiet. It was
peaceful.''
   James said that he had mixed a lethal dose of barbiturates in a
glass of grape juice and gave it to Lower to drink.
   James said he was questioned by investigators from the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the Coroner's Office
following Lower's death on Nov. 18, the Los Angeles Times reported
today.
   But James did not tell investigators about his role in Lower's
death, sheriff's Capt. Bob Grimm said.
   ``He made no representation of those facts to us,'' Grimm said.
``If he helped the victim commit suicide we would be very
interested in talking to him.''
   A coroner's report, written by investigator Michael Joseph, said
authorities recovered a note and a ``glass containing a clear
liquid from the table'' next to Lower's body.
   James, who said he counseled AIDS patients through the Shanti
Foundation and AIDS Project Los Angeles, did not immediately return
taped telephone messages relayed through the agencies and his name
was not listed in telephone directories.
   During the television interview, James said he was ``completely
aware of the fact that in California it's a felony and that I could
serve up to five years in the state penitentiary.''
   Lower, 28, suffered from AIDS-related complex, a condition
similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``My friend, Keith, who I assisted to take his own life, was in
such a debilitated condition, he was manifesting malignant tumors
in his lungs, he had suffered AIDS-related complex for seven to
eight years,'' James told ABC.
   The symptoms of ARC include swollen lymph glands, low-grade
fevers, drenching night sweats, weight loss, extreme fatigue and
chronic diarrhea. The symptoms of AIDS include these plus
life-threatening cancers and infections that take advantage of the
body's weakened immune system.
   James, who said he also suffers from AIDS-related complex, told
ABC that he supports legalized euthanasia and hopes that someone
will help him end his own life if and when the pain becomes
intolerable.
   A coroner's report and death certificate contained no suggestion
that James participated in Lower's death, and characterized it as
an ``apparent suicide.'' Lower died from ``acute barbiturate and
diphenhydramine intoxication,'' the report said. The latter is an
antihistamine.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the dominant Christian Democrat Party
formed Italy's 48th postwar government on Wednesday from the same
five moderate parties that made up the previous coalition.
   Ciriaco De Mita said he will present his government to
Parliament next week for approval.
   Giovanni Goria, a fellow Christian Democrat, resigned as premier
March 11 after eight turbulent months in office. The alliance,
which has figured in nearly all the governments this decade, also
included the Socialists, Republicans, Social Democrats and Liberals.
   Also remaining the same are many of the faces in the Cabinet,
including Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democrat,
and Defense Minister Valerio Zanone, a Liberal.
   Asked if the new government would last through the end of the
legislative term in 1992, De Mita's rival, former Socialist Premier
Bettino Craxi, said Tuesday: ``It would be a miracle.''
   De Mita, after announcing the government on Wednesday, was asked
about Craxi's comment. ``Men don't produce miracles,'' De Mita said.
   The new premier will have to grapple with some of the same
complex and sticky issues that bedeviled Goria. They include the
future of Italy's energy policy and how to reform a cumbersome
law-making process and bureaucracy.
   In negotiations leading to De Mita's announcement that he had
succeeded in forming a government, the parties put off a decision
on whether to complete a nuclear plant north of Rome.
   President Francesco Cossiga on March 16 asked De Mita to try to
put together a government. Factional fighting among Christian
Democrats, Goria's own party, had beleagured the Goria government,
hastening its demise.
   The final straw for Goria was strong Socialist objections to a
government decision to go ahead with construction on the power
plant, despite a voter referendum which effectively called for a
moratorium on nuclear development.
   Right after De Mita's announcement of the Cabinet, some Social
Democrats said they were unhappy with the two members of their
party chosen for the Cabinet.
   However, they said they would support the government.
   De Mita, 60, has been leader of the Christian Democrats since
1982. The party, regularly winning about one-third of the votes, is
Italy's largest ballot-getter, and its leadership is considered the
country's most powerful political seat.
   De Mita is the first Christian Democrat to hold both the
premiership and the party helm in 29 years. Christian Democrats
will decide if they like that novelty in the fall, when the party
convention is expected to be held.
   The new premier has said that also holding the party post gives
him the authority to govern effectively.
   The son of a tailor, De Mita was born in Nusco, a poor mountain
village east of Naples. His bald pate delights political satirists.
   He was first elected to Parliament in 1963 and has held Cabinet
posts, none of them key ones.
   For the first time there is more than one woman minister, with
cultural affairs joining special affairs as ministries headed by
women.

   Militant Sikhs fired a barrage of
bullets around the Golden Temple on Wednesday and raised the
outlawed flag of their visionary Sikh nation to mark the holy
harvest festival of Baisakha.
   The shooting sent many pilgrims, who visit the shrine for a
ritual bath on holidays, running for cover. Shopkeepers outside the
temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, closed their shutters in fear.
   Police said the firing at the pool surrounding the Golden Temple
was evidence that the militants were gathering weapons inside the
complex.
   The Golden Temple's chief priest, Jasbir Singh Rode, said that
``if police enter the Golden Temple, the foundation for a separate
state will be laid.''
   Baisakha commemorates both the harvest and the anniversary of
Guru Gobind Singh's introduction of the so-called baptism by sword
for Sikhs in 1699. The guru was the 10th and last in the faith.
   The militants at the Golden Temple fired automatic rifles and
other weapons for about 15 minutes and raised the outlawed saffron
flag of Khalistan, the name they give their would-be state, police
and witnesses said.
   There were no reports of injuries, but police said many of the
estimated 400 pilgrims at the temple panicked.
   Police also said for the first time that the militants were
building fortifications inside the temple complex and chipping
gun-holes into walls, apparently to protect against any entry of
police or soldiers into the shrine.
   In Talwandi Sabo, about 120 miles south of Amritsar, Rode told
about 40,000 Sikhs that ``if police enter the Golden Temple, the
foundation for a separate state will be laid.''
   Rode is the nephew of Jarnail Sing Bhindranwale, who is regarded
as the founder of the militant Sikh movement.
   Bhindranwale was killed during the Indian army's 1984 raid on
the Golden Temple complex, which was aimed at driving militants
from the shrine. Hundreds of Sikhs were killed, and Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi was assassinated later that year by Sikh bodyguards.
   Rode announced the merger of two factions of the the merger of
two factions of the All India Sikh Students Federation, which is at
the forefront of the militant movement.
   Sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for
more political autonomy or a separate homeland in Punjab state.
Sikhs are a religious minority in India and claim discrimination by
the majority Hindus, but they are a majority in Punjab.
   Sikhs have been blamed for killing more than 715 people this
year.
   In New Delhi, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi told moderate Sikhs
who came to his home with holiday greetings that there was ``a
conspiracy'' to alienate the Sikhs from the rest of Indian society.
   The United News of India quoted Gandhi as repeating his
accusation that rival Pakistan was aiding Sikh militants who are
fighting for an independent Sikh homeland. The challenge, he said,
``has to be met collectively by the people of India.''
   Gandhi said the government was prepared to talk with anyone
``within the framework of the constitution,'' ruling out the
militants' demand that talks focus on formation of a separate Sikh
nation.

   For the third time in little more than
a week, Air Force jets scrambled to intercept Soviet bombers
approaching North America.
   Master Sgt. George Crawford said two F-15 Eagles met the Bear-H
bombers about 460 miles northeast of Point Barrow on Tuesday. At no
time did the Soviets penetrate U.S. or Canadian airspace, Crawford
said.
   Their closest approach to land was 137 miles north of Shingle
Point in Canada's Yukon Territory, Crawford said.
   Tracking of the bombers was coordinated between U.S. and
Canadian commands, he said. The F-15s flew with the Soviet bombers
for a little more than two hours, he said. They were scrambled from
Galena and refueled by KC-135s from Eielson Air Force Base near
Fairbanks, he said. An E-3 from Eielson provided radar assistance,
Crawford said.

<HEAD>US Warns of ``Human Catastrophe'' in Ethiopia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ethiopian government's decision to shut
down an international relief effort has raised the specter of a
``human catastrophe'' with more than 2 million people facing
starvation, the State Department said Wednesday.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman accused Ethiopia of
sacrificing the interests of millions of its citizens in pursuit of
military objectives in two northern provinces where anti-government
rebellions have been under way for years.
   He said the United States does not accept Ethiopia's contention
that the decision was made for the security of persons in that
area, that the expulsions of relief workers is temporary and that
indigenous organizations can take up the slack.
   These claims ``ring hollow against the sheer magnitude of the
disaster,'' Redman said.
   He said that even before the recent fighting, the combined
international and local feeding effort was slowly losing ground to
the growing numbers of hungry people.
   ``To assert that greatly reduced operations can now succeed is
folly,'' the spokesman said. ``The world cannot stand idly by and
permit innocent people to die.''
   Redman called on Ethiopia to reconsider its decision and to
allow relief operations on an ``open roads, open risk basis.''
Without a quick resumption, he said, hundreds of thousands of lives
may be lost.
   A United Nations emissary is expected to arrive in Addis Ababa
on Thursday to encourage Ethiopian authorities to resume relief
activities.
   The Ethiopian decision was the result of a dramatic escalation
in the conflict in Eritrea and Tigray provinces, where many of the
towns that served as distribution points have been taken by forces
opposed to the Marxist government.
   The United States has pledged a contribution of 250,000 tons of
food to Ethiopia for this fiscal year, comparable to the amount
promised by the Soviet Union, Ethiopia's principal ally.
   Total confirmed pledges by all foreign donors combined add up to
about 890,000 tons.
   The U.S. contribution amounts to $90.7 million, excluding $6.6
million for transportation costs.

   Princess Caroline of Monaco doused speculation she
is again pregnant Wednesday and said her support of ballet
companies is something her famous mother would be doing if she were
still alive.
   The princess held court with the news media in her two-story
presidential suite atop the Hotel Inter-Continental. She is in
Miami for a fund-raising gala supporting ballet companies here and
in Monaco.
   When a reporter asked whether she was pregnant again, she said:
``Not that I know of.'' She and her second husband, businessman
Stefano Casiraghi, have three children.
   ``I just had the last one seven months ago and I want to enjoy
him for a while,'' the 31-year-old princess said. ``That doesn't
mean I'm going to stop having children. I plan on having as many as
God will allow.''
   On Thursday, the princess will attend a gala performance by the
Miami City Ballet to raise funds for that organization and Les
Ballets de Monte Carlo. She said her late mother, the former
actress Grace Kelly, had been active in reviving the Monte Carlo
ballet and promoting the arts in general.
   She laughed when she was asked about a flap that arose because
the hotel brought in chickens from California to feed the princess
during a dinner, raising the hackles of Florida chicken producers.
   ``Of course, I'm very sad for the Florida chicken producers,''
she said. ``Now that I know it's not a Florida chicken, I certainly
won't touch it.''

   David Ruffin, the former lead singer for the
Motown group the Temptations, has been ordered to stand trial on a
cocaine possession charge.
   Ruffin, 46, on Tuesday was ordered to be tried for alleged
possession of less than 50 grams of cocaine. He is free on a $1,500
bond. If convicted, he could be sentenced to four years in jail.
   Ruffin was charged in connection with a July 1987 raid on a
Detroit house. Officers found a blue clutch bag on a kitchen table
containing papers with Ruffin's name and cocaine residue. He was in
the basement of the house at the time.
   The singer's attorney, Jeffrey Collins, said Ruffin's
arraignment was delayed because he has been in a drug treatment
program in New York. Collins was appointed by the court because the
one-time superstar indicated he couldn't afford a lawyer.
   In ordering Ruffin to stand trial, District Judge William
Hathaway said he felt sorry for the singer, who left the popular
group in 1968. No trial date was set.
   ``But if this war continues on crack (cocaine) in this city, we
may have judges, prosecutors ... and other prominent citizens
possibly picked up,'' the judge said.
   The Temptations hits included ``My Girl'' and ``(I Know I'm)
Losing You.''

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor loved the baby
gibbon and monkey that publisher Malcolm Forbes gave her during
their three days in Bangkok, but she left them behind because they

   Ross Petzing, spokesman of the American Embassy in Bangkok, said
the apes were being cared for by an employee of the Oriental Hotel,
where Ms. Taylor and Forbes stayed before leaving for Tokyo on
Tuesday night.
   The two were here on a private visit.
   Petzing said he didn't know where Forbes, the millionaire
publisher of Forbes magazine, got the animals. The gift had drawn
criticism from wildlife conservationists.
   ``While Ms. Taylor was very appreciative and particularly fond
of the gift, both (she and Forbes) were made conscious of the fact
that they are endangered,'' Petzing said. ``Consequently, they were
very happy to leave them here.''
   On Wednesday, Ms. Taylor and Forbes arrived in Tokyo, where she
is working to raise money for AIDS research. She planned to attend
a fund-raiser and also was to meet government leaders, including
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.

   American evangelist Billy Graham said Wednesday
he was aware of past oppression of Christians in China, but was
encouraged by the opening of several thousand churches in recent
years.
   Graham, making his first visit to China, said at a welcoming
banquet that he hopes to be a ``bridge-builder while I'm here, in a
small way'' and called the opportunity to preach in Chinese
churches ``a great privilege.''
   The 69-year-old evangelist arrived Tuesday for a 16-day tour. He
is to preach in churches in Beijing and Shanghai, and meet
religious leaders and seminary scholars. He will not hold any large
rallies.
   Graham, who has preached in 60 countries including the Soviet
Union, said in his banquet remarks that he was ``fully aware of the
oppression suffered by the churches of China during the Cultural
Revolution, and that there are still occasional reports of
difficulties and tensions in some areas.''
   But he said he and his wife, Ruth, who was born in China as the
daughter of missionaries, are encouraged by the progress made since
then.
   During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, religion was banned and
worshipers were persecuted and jailed. Since then, religious
freedom has been guaranteed, but only under the auspices of
state-sanctioned religious organizations.

   An admitted burglar is keeping
lawmen from 17 police departments hopping with tales of how he
broke into more than 1,000 homes in the past two years.
   Timothy Thompson claims more than 4,000 victims in Palm Beach
County, police said, and can give minute details of the break-ins.
   ``His mind is like a computer,'' said Lantana police Sgt. Jim
Upton. ``He can tell us how he got in the house and what he took.
And we research the reports and those items are listed on the
report.''
   The Palm Beach sheriff's office Tuesday blamed Thompson for 517
burglaries in their area, and 16 cities have accused Thompson or
say he is a suspect in 552 more burglaries.
   ``This guy remembers the house, the layout of the house and what
he took,'' sheriff's Sgt. Ken Deischer said. ``He has amazing
recall.''
   Acting on a tip, Lantana police last month arrested Thompson at
the Knight's Inn on March 10. In his room, officials found stolen
clothes, handguns and jewelry, Upton said. Sheriff's detectives
later found discovered thousands of dollars in stolen merchandise
in a rented storage room near Lake Worth.
   ``We had been having a lot of residential burglaries near the
Knight's Inn,'' Upton said. ``We were getting clobbered. He was one
of the persons I had as a suspect.''
   So far, officials have recovered more than $60,000 worth of
stolen merchandise, from cowboy boots to silverware. Thompson
remains in the Palm Beach County jail on charges including
burglary, grand theft and possession of a firearm by a convicted
felon.
   Thomspon is suspected of 109 burglaries in Lantana, 35 in
Boynton Beach, 215 in Lake Worth and numerous others in Boca Raton,
Delray Beach, West Palm Beach, Manalapan, Jupiter Inlet Colony,
Palm Beach Gardens, Gulf Stream, Greenacres City, Palm Beach, Lake
Park, Jupiter, Tequesta and North Palm Beach.
   Thompson has a long history of burglary in Palm Beach County and
has served prison time, authorities said.

   Kirk opened a school-bank savings account in January at his
elementary school, Lincoln IGE, in cooperation with Bank One of
Dayton.
   On Tuesday, Kirk received his first statement from Bank One. It
showed his savings account earned 16 cents interest on the $27 he
had deposited. It also showed the bank deducted $4 in service
charges.
   His account had shrunk by $3.84.
   ``It wasn't fair,'' Kirk said. ``They're just teaching us not to

waive monthly service charges for any savings account opened by a
minor.
   Kirk's account was charged by mistake, she said, and the money

if something isn't done the city could lose millions of dollars in
highway funds for street projects.

them mysteriously fade over the next few weeks.

because the city is planning to use state money for the project.

   They expect it will take them two or three years to complete the
round trip they began Wednesday morning from their Bayfield County
farm in northwest Wisconsin. Their route will take them across the
back roads of Minnesota and then southwest toward New Mexico.
   ``This is our dream,'' Ben Dinwiddie, 44, said as he cleaned out
his barn this week with his wife, Honey, and four children. ``I
hope this trip means a lot more to my kids than most things in
their lives.''
   ``We'll hit the small- and medium-sized towns,'' Dinwiddie said.
``The big towns don't want us.''
   One wagon is full of food, one carries hay and livestock, and
the other is packed with clothes, games, books and Bibles. The
parents will handle teaching duties for the children, Chester, 13;
Terrie, 16; Tom, 10; and John, 9.
   The Dinwiddies sold most of their farming equipment to finance
the trip, which they first discussed several years ago.
   They plan to return to their farm, if it isn't sold by the time
they get back. If it is sold, they said they'll buy land in some
other part of the state.
   ``People around here have come from the old and into the
modern,'' Dinwiddie said. ``We did just the opposite. We came from
the modern to the old. That's hard for most people to understand.''

<TEXT>
   Union leaders and managers agreed to
end a three-day lockout at the nation's second largest shipyard
Wednesday, but labor turmoil spread with police firing tear gas at
200 taxi drivers.
   Officials at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery Ltd. said
that the firm's 11,000 workers, shut out of the shipyard since
Monday, were expected to approve the agreement Thursday.
   They said workers would get a 20 percent increase, about $91, in
monthly salaries and allowances.
   Daewoo managers closed the shipyard on southern Koje Island
after workers demanded a 55 percent pay increase that the company
said it could not afford.
   On the outskirts of Seoul, police fired tear gas and arrested
five people Wednesday when about 200 striking taxi drivers began
hurling stones at other cabbies opposed to the stoppage.
   Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the nation's largest shipbuilder,
and 181 taxi unions in Seoul notified the government Wednesday of
labor disputes.
   The latest outbreak brings to 320 the number of disputes this
year, according to the Labor Ministry. Labor officials said 74 of
those still await settlement.
   Violent protests battered many companies last summer after
student-led demonstrations prompted the government to promise major
reforms, including December's presidential election. Roh Tae-woo
won the election over a divided opposition, and government
opponents have been escalating their campaign to topple him.
   However, labor leaders recently asked union members to shun
violence and political demands, and most of the latest labor
disputes have been peaceful.
   In the southeastern port of Ulsan, union leaders from 24
companies, including Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea's largest
carmaker, joined forces Wednesday, threatening to strike over
demands for pay increases.
   Meanwhile, Daewoo Motor Co. remained paralyzed Wednesday for a
second day with 9,100 workers picketing four assembly lines near
Seoul and in the southern city of Pusan.
   The strike at South Korea's second largest auto company, a joint
venture with the U.S. General Motors Corp., has slowed delivery of
100,000 compact cars, mostly to the United States.

<HEAD>Reagan Suggests Jackson's Positions Getting Too Little Scrutiny</HEAD>

   President Reagan said today he fears that
public criticism of Jesse Jackson's campaign positions has been
muted because of concern that it could be considered racist.
   Answering questions during an appearance the American Society of
Newspaper Editors convention, Reagan said it seems to him that
``more attention is being paid to the difference in color than is
being paid to what he (Jackson) is actually saying.''
   Reagan rarely has singled out any of the Democratic candidates
for criticism, usually assailing general party positions on issues.
   But when asked to assess the state of civil rights in this
country during a year in which a black is running for president,
Reagan said of Jackson:
   ``I have to believe that a great many of us would find ourselves
in great disagreement with the policies that he is proposing, and
would perhaps be more vocal about them, if it wasn't for concern
that that'd be misinterpreted into some kind of a racial attack.''
   Reagan, whose administration's civil rights record was
criticized by Supreme Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall
late last year, said ``the most frustrating thing that I've endured
since I've been here, and the image-making that goes on, is that
I've been portrayed so often as in some way a racist or prejudiced
with regard to racial matters.''
   ``It's hard for me to take,'' the president said, ``because I
grew up in a family in which that was considered the greatest sin _
prejudice and discrimination.''
   Reagan went on to say he had opposed discrimination ``all my
life.''
   ``Back when I was a sports announcer broadcasting major league
baseball, I was one of the little handful across the country that
continued to editorialize for the breaking of the ban and the
allowing of blacks into organized baseball,'' he said.
   But Reagan also said ``I just regret'' that race has ``become a
factor'' in the 1988 presidential campaign.
   ``The candidates (campaigns) should all be based on what are
their policies and what is it that they would propose to do,'' he
said.
   ``And I would be very frank with you, I find a great
disagreement with some of the things that are being proposed by
Jesse Jackson. But I also find a great deal of disagreement with
his fellow candidates in that party, which is why I've suggested
everybody support a Republican,'' Reagan added.
   He did not spell out which Jackson positions he did not like.
   Asked how he thought the presidential sweepstakes would turn
out, Reagan said that ``in the Republican Party, of course, it has
now narrowed down to one candidate (George Bush), but even so there
is a convention to be held.''
   ``And on the other side,'' he said, ``I don't know whether the
candidates now campaigning ... whether anyone of them is going to
wind up at the convention with the nomination or whether there will
be a brokered convention or whether the Democratic Party will go
afield seeking to draft someone who has not been campaigning in the
primaries.''
   ``I just refuse to try to make a guess on this,'' Reagan said.

   Nine-year-old Kirk Ritchey thought he was
saving for a rainy day. Instead, he found he'd been soaked.
   Kirk opened a school-bank savings account in January at his
elementary school, Lincoln IGE, in cooperation with Bank One of
Dayton.
   On Tuesday, Kirk received his first statement from Bank One. It
showed his savings account earned 16 cents interest on the $27 he
had deposited. It also showed the bank deducted $4 in service
charges.
   His account had shrunk by $3.84.
   ``It wasn't fair,'' Kirk said. ``They're just teaching us not to
go to the bank, or we'll get ripped off.''
   Peggy O'Donnell, a customer service officer who coordinates the
school savings program for Bank One, said the bank's policy is to
waive monthly service charges for any savings account opened by a
minor.
   Kirk's account was charged by mistake, she said, and the money
will be restored.

   Pranksters on the Rice University campus managed
an about-face of a 2,000-pound bronze statue of founder William
Marsh Rice that had stood its ground as the centerpice of the
campus for 58 years.
   A campus police officer noticing activity around the statue
before dawn on Tuesday managed to apprehend one student driving
away from the quadrangle in a pickup truck. When the officer
inspected the statue he found it was facing the Fondren Library to
the south instead of the Lovett Building to the north as it had
always done.
   It took a crew of professional museum movers and a crane 3{
hours to get the statue to once again gaze north.
   The university is looking into the matter.

   DULUTH, Minn. (AP) _ City fathers wanting to stick with the
quaint look of their brick streets are considering gluing them with
reflective tape to meet a state and federal requiremnt for lane
stripes.
   The tape would cost $1.25 a foot compared to 5 to 10 cents a
foot for paint, city Traffic Engineer Dan Murphy said Tuesday. But
if something isn't done the city could lose millions of dollars in
highway funds for street projects.
   In October, city workers painted the stripes _ only to watch
them mysteriously fade over the next few weeks.
   The state Department of Transportation must approve the proposal
because the city is planning to use state money for the project.
Bill Croke, the department's state aid engineer for the Duluth
area, said the tape has good possibilities.

<HEAD>Relief Official Says Drought Aid Will Wait Until Rebels Crushed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopia's chief relief official
said Wednesday that full drought aid operations in the north will
resume only after the government defeats rebel troops.
   Western relief officials fear this will cause deaths from
starvation within weeks.
   ``Our worry is not only the problem of famine, but the integrity
of the country,'' Berhanu Jembere, head of the government Relief
and Rehabilitation Commission, told The Associated Press in an
interview.
   ``It is the obligation of any government to defend its
territory,'' he said of the civil wars in Eritrea and Tigre that
have crippled efforts to feed 3.2 million drought victims. ``As
soon as the area is cleansed of bandit activity, we will resume our
operation.''
   Berhanu could not give a date. ``I have to leave that to the
military personnel in charge of the situation.''
   Also Wednesday, the government warned cross-border operations to
get relief food to the north would ``be met with an appropriate
response.''
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front in March announced it had
stockpiled 9 tons of food in neighboring Sudan and would deliver it
to areas it controlled in Ethiopia this month.
   A strongly worded statement from Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said it had no doubt that ``Sudan will not fall prey to the
machinations of sinister forces and collaborate in such a serious
breach of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ethiopia.''
   After years of official silence, Ethiopia two weeks ago admitted
to being at war after losing or abandoning much of the north to
secessionist rebels, who have been fighting 27 years in Eritrea and
14 years in Tigre.
   The government pullback and last week's expulsion of foreign aid
workers has left the entire relief operation to Berhanu's
commission and the Joint Relief Project, a Christian consortium
that includes the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and is closely involved
with indigenous aid agencies.
   Berhanu claimed his agency could feed 2.4 million people, but
said neither his commission nor the Christians could operate
outside small areas still under government control.
   Western relief officials say the commission and the relief
project together could feed only 1 million people at most.
   They said starvation deaths could begin within weeks and expect
mass migration of the hungry toward Mekele in Tigre, and the
Eritrean capital of Asmara, two towns still held by the government.
   Berhanu said the government already has set up feeding centers
there and was preparing other ``contingency plans,'' including
shelters for refugees who include civil servants and local
government officials fleeing the wars.
   The government and aid agencies for months have tried to avoid
shelters. During the 1984-85 famine, which killed about 1 million
Ethiopians, more people died from diseases contracted in
overcrowded unsanitary feeding camps than from starvation.
   Berhanu stood firm on Ethiopia's expulsion of about 60
expatriates from Eritrea and Tigre and rejected relief agencies'
requests for a skeleton staff to remain to monitor food
distribution.
   The Foreign Ministry statement warned continued
``misrepresentation'' of the evacuation order ``could compel the
Ethiopian government to suspend their services altogether.''
   It suggested some relief workers were spies, saying ``some have
started shedding crocodile tears, perhaps because a few of their
agents masquerading as relief workers are no longer in place to
continue to perpetrate their sinister roles.''
   Berhanu warned of ``grave consequences'' unless all foreign
workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross left the
north by Wednesday. Red Cross spokesman Vincent Bernard said five
Western employees were expected to return Wednesday night.
   The relief operation relied almost solely on huge food shipments
from Western donors and heavily on Western-financed trucks and
airplanes.
   Berhanu said C-130 cargo planes carrying grain to Mekele would
be allowed to continue operations, but all light aircraft must
leave Ethiopia. Most of the small planes ferried passengers, but
some carried food to inaccessible regions south of Tigre and
Eritrea.

   Two convicted murderers commandeered an
ambulance Wednesday and held a prison guard and three medical
workers hostage, but police stormed the vehicle after two of the
hostages bolted, and the other two escaped unharmed.
   The two inmates were recaptured unhurt and returned to the
Tennessee State Penitentiary, police said.
   Edward Corley, 35, and Jerry Lynn Driver, 22, face charges of
escape, aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault, authorities
said.
   Police said the prisoners overpowered a guard, a nurse and two
emergency medical technicians who came to the prison after one of
the inmates apparently faked an illness.
   The hostages were identified as nurse Vivian Bone, prison guard
Robert Peebles, and medical technicians Morris Tidwell and James
Pollard, said Metro Nashville Police Homicide Detective David
Miller.
   The two men forced the hostages into the ambulance early
Wednesday and drove east on Interstate 40 about 10 miles. The
ambulance was stopped and surrounded near the Stewarts Ferry Pike
area east of the city, Maj. Frank Galbaugh said.
   Galbaugh said one of the paramedics may have been able to warn
police of the escape over the ambulance's radio.
   Negotiators, dealing with the suspects over the radio, obtained
the freedom of one of the hostages.
   ``The hostage negotiators did a real good job in getting one of
the EMTs released, and he was debriefed,'' Galbaugh said.
``Meanwhile, we set up our tactical operation, and when the
negotiators reached an impasse, they turned it over to the SWAT
team.''
   The special weapons and tactics team had surrounded the
ambulance, and when the second paramedic bolted from the vehicle,
they moved in, Galbaugh said.
   ``The suspects were getting hysterical, threatening to kill the
hostages,'' Galbaugh said. ``That EMT was a brave individual to get
out and give us a chance.''
   Galbaugh said no injuries were reported, but said the two
inmates might have been shaken up during their arrest.
   ``When we disarmed them both and took them out of the vehicle,
they might have been bounced around a little bit,'' he said.
``We're very happy that nobody got hurt seriously.''
   When the SWAT team entered the vehicle, Corley was lying on one
of the two benches in the rear of ambulance, holding Ms. Bone by
the neck, Galbaugh said. Driver was lying on the floor near the
driver's seat, and Peebles was sitting on the other bench, Galbaugh
said.

<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee was stymied Wednesday on
the issue of whether to slap aid sanctions on five hemispheric
neighbors for not doing their part in the war on drugs.
   The Foreign Affairs Western Hemisphere subcommittee deadlocked
in a 6-6 tie on whether to penalize Mexico, the Bahamas, Peru,
Paraguay and Bolivia, all countries on a State Department list of
major drug-producing and transit points.
   The impasse _ similar to one reached a day earlier in the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee _ sent the five separate resolutions to
the full Foreign Affairs Committee without recommendation. Full
committee action is likely next week.
   During debate over the issue, a standoff emerged between
lawmakers who feel domestic political pressure to strike a blow
against drug trafficking and those who believe imposing sanctions
on allies and neighbors would do more harm than good.
   ``These nations may feel themselves offended,'' said Rep. Ted
Weiss, D-N.Y., who supported the sanctions bills. ``But these are
real life-and-death threats that my constituents face daily.''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., argued against the legislation, saying
it was more a political palliative than an effective weapon in the
war on drugs.
   ``We are not serious about stemming the drug traffic'' in the
United States, Hyde said. ``We'd rather point the finger at Bolivia
and Paraguay than Miami, Chicago and San Francisco.''
   Leonardo Ffrench, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in
Washington, said his country regards the drug problem as a threat
to its own well-being and is devoting all possible resources to the
battle regardless of pressure from the United States.
   ``We are not looking for cheers or for jeers from abroad,'' the
spokesman said. ``We ought to strengthen cooperation instead of
pointing fingers and blaming each other. That might only favor the
interests of the drug traffickers themselves.''
   Under the law, countries identified as drug production or
transit points must be certified by the president each year as
``fully cooperating'' with U.S. anti-drug efforts or risk losing
half their aid money, trade preferences such as sugar import
quotas, and U.S. support for loans from international development
banks.
   On March 1, President Reagan made such a certification for 17 of
the 24 countries on the drug production and transit list, including
Mexico, the Bahamas and Bolivia. The administration said Paraguay
wasn't cooperating sufficiently, but certified it anyway for
national security reasons, as the law allows.
   Because none of the countries receives large amounts of U.S.
economic and military aid, the sanctions would have little economic
effect. The country with the most at stake is Bolivia, which gets
about $22 million in economic aid.
   But their political impact is potentially great. U.S.-Mexico
relations always are delicate, and the Mexican government has
served notice privately that if Congress succeeds at
decertification, cooperation with anti-drug efforts will be sharply
curtailed and U.S. authorities may be kicked out of the country.
   The Senate is likely to take up as soon as Thursday similar
sanctions bills dealing with Mexico and the Bahamas, and a separate
measure adding Haiti to the list of countries that should come
under increased scrutiny because of drug trafficking.

   More than 250 placard-waving demonstrators
marched in front of the Spanish Embassy on Wednesday to protest the
drug conviction and sentence of American photographer Conan Owen in
Barcelona last week.
   ``The bottom line is that a good kid is in jail and he's not
guilty,'' said Joseph Traver, a director of the National Press
Photographers Association.
   Owen, 23, of nearby Annandale, Va., was convicted on
drug-trafficking charge, sentenced to six years and one day in jail
and fined $18,000. Since his arrest a year ago, Owen has maintained
he was duped into carrying $200,000 worth of cocaine in a
false-bottom suitcase.
   The crowd of friends, collegues and supporters chantedd in
English and Spanish ``Conan es inocente. Conan is innocent. Conan
es inocente, inocente, incente,'' as Owen's cousin Teresa Corrales
delivered a letter to the Spanish ambassador.
   At the embassy door, Corrales and her grandmother, Elizabeth
Goulett, both of Alexandria, Va., were met by the embassy's
communications officer.
   ``She (the communications officer) told me she would deliver the
letter to the ambassador, but said the demonstration would have
neither a negative or positive effect on Conan's situation,''
Corrales said.
   Although the demonstrators had hoped for a more decisive
reaction to the protest, Corrales said this was just the first
effort and more was to come.
   Traver, who met Owen while the younger man was a college intern
at the Buffalo (N.Y.) News in the early 1980s, said the defense
fund hoped to raise enough money to cover Owen's fine, legal costs
and living expenses. He also expressed concern about raising funds
to honor Owen's financial commitment to the Army ROTC program. So
far they have collected $20,000, he said.
   At his trial, Owen testified he had been hired in the United
States by Jorge Barahona to take pictures in Spain and Chile for a
Mexico City travel gency. As part of that asssignment, Barahona
gave Owen the suitcase, the photographer thought was filled with
travel brochures bound for Santiago.
   Barahona, an Ecuadorian-born naturalized American, received a
two-year suspended sentence in federal court on a drug conspiracy
charge after a reaching a plea bargain with prosecutors.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Justin Williams testified at Owen's
one-day trial that Barahona said Owen did not know cocaine was in
the suitcase he carried into Barcelona airport on March 13, 1987.

   Convicted murderer Leslie Lowenfield went to
his death Wednesday in the Louisiana electric chair, professing his
innocence to the end, as two relatives of his victims looked on.
   Lowenfield's attorney had argued unsuccessfully in the last
appeals that he was a paranoid schizophrenic who could not
comprehend the possibility of execution. Four members of the U.S.
Supreme Court indicated support for a stay of execution, but a
majority of five turned the appeal down.
   Lowenfield, 34, was convicted of gunning down his estranged
girlfriend, Sheila Thomas, and four members of her family,
including a 4-year-old daughter, in 1982.
   Miss Thomas' sister and her husband, Connie and Bryan Encalade,
were in the front row of witnesses who watched Lowenfield die in
the electric chair shortly after midnight.
   ``Connie and Bryan, I hope you all feel satisfied,'' Lowenfield
said in his brief final statement. He stood directly in front of
the couple, looking into their faces from three feet away behind a
window.
   ``Don't give up on me, although my life will be over tonight,
because the one responsible is still out there,'' he said. ``No
reason to hold anything against me and the rest who would lie.''
   Under prison rules, the witnesses were not allowed to talk to
reporters after the execution.
   In the eight hours before he died, the appeal was rejected in
quick succession by the Louisiana Supreme Court and three federal
courts.
   Lowenfield was the only man in recent Louisiana history to
receive three death sentences.
   He was found guilty of shooting Miss Thomas, 27, who was a
Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputy; her daughter, Shantel Osborne,
4; her stepfather, Owen Griffin, 45; her mother, Myrtle Griffin,
44; and the little girl's father, Carl Osborne, 33. Prosecutors
said notes written by Lowenfield showed he was jealous of Osborne.
   Though his final appeal hinged on the argument that Lowenfield
was mentally ill, Lowenfield insisted he was in Florida at the time
of the murders and refused to allow an insanity defense at the time
of his original trial.
   Five of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices opposed delaying
the execution. Justice William Brennan wrote a dissent, joined by
Thurgood Marshall. Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens issued a
separate statement indicating they would have granted the requested
stay, a court spokeswoman said.
   During Lowenfield's final hours, he was paid a surprise visit by
Louisiana State University basketball coach Dale Brown.
   ``Regardless if he's guilty or not guilty, I imagined the fear
he must be experiencing,'' Brown said afterward. He said Lowenfield
had been writing him letters since they met in 1984 when Brown and
some of his players visited the prison.
   ``I saw no fear,'' Brown said. ``I saw no bitterness. I never
saw it in any letters, either.'' He said he heard Tuesday that
Lowenfield's execution was imminent, and he reread all the letters
before deciding to call and ask to see him.
   Lowenfield was the 97th person put to death in the United States
since the Supreme Court allowed states to restore the death penalty
in 1976, and the fourth this year. Seventeen of the executions have
been in Louisiana.

   Singer Debbie Harry and songwriter Irving Berlin
are among dozens of celebrities who owe back taxes to New York
state, the New York Post reported Wednesday.
   The Post said it had obtained state records which indicated Miss
Harry owes $241,354 for record royalties while Berlin owes $5,500.
   In addition, the Post said transsexual tennis player and
ophthalmologist Renee Richards owes nearly $33,000 and drummer
Lionel Hampton's Lionel Hampton Enterprises owes $10,500 in
withholding taxes.
   The records indicated the state was seeking almost $289,000 from
the estate of jazz great Duke Ellington and more than $91,000 from
the estate of singer Brook Benton, who died Saturday.
   On Monday, movie reviewer Rex Reed pleaded guilty to evading
more than $20,000 in state income taxes.
   The Post said most of the tax assessments came from the state
tax department's Los Angeles bureau, which examines celebrity
sheets, gossip columns and booking charts for the New York income
of West Coast stars.
   The Post said a secretary for Berlin denied that the 99-year-old
songwriter owed taxes. Hampton's manager, Bill Titone, said the
withholding tax problem was cleared up in 1987. A secretary for
Richards said the issue was being handled by Richards' lawyer.
   Miss Harry's lawyer, Gary Kurfirst, said the singer was repaying
her debt in installments and would owe no money by the end of the
year.

<HEAD>Can Murder Defendant Be Tried Again After False Start in Wrong
Court?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SIMPSON</BYLINE>

   Stephen Craig Schiefelbein was already on trial
for murder when a prosecutor realized the case was in the wrong
county, setting off debate over whether a defense lawyer who knew
of the mixup was right to keep mum and whether Schiefelbein must go
free.
   ``It would be a miscarriage of justice if he were able to escape
because of a problem like that,'' said Steve Roberts, the chief
assistant district attorney in DeKalb County, where prosecutors
hope to renew the charges that had to be dismissed in neighboring
Fulton County.
   But Bob Joiner, Schiefelbein's public defender, isn't
apologizing.
   ``All this guy's got going for him is me,'' he said Wednesday.
``If I've got to help the prosecutor, my God, he'd be better off
without a lawyer.''
   Schiefelbein, 38, was accused of fatally stabbing a man who
befriended him and invited him to dinner on Christmas Eve 1986. The
stabbing occurred in a home in an Atlanta neighborhood which
crosses the Fulton-DeKalb county line.
   Law officers in both counties had assured prosecutors the house
was in Fulton County, said Assistant District Attorney Linda
Finley, and no one contradicted them until the first day of
Schiefelbein's trial had been completed April 5 in Fulton County
Superior Court.
   Then, Ms. Finley said, she telephoned the owner of the house,
who was to testify the next day, to go over his testimony, and ``he
informed me that his house was, in fact, about two houses over the
line in DeKalb County.''
   The next day, Superior Court Judge Philip Etheridge declared a
mistrial and lectured Joiner, who said he had known the case was in
the wrong court. The judge told Joiner he ``wasted a lot of time
and did your client absolutely no service whatever.''
   Joiner contends what he really did was earn an eventual
acquittal for his client. He said federal courts have held that
part of a criminal case is proving it is being brought in the right
court, so failure to prove that amounts to failure for the entire
prosecution. Another prosecution for the same crime would violate
the Constitution's ban on double jeopardy, Joiner argued.
   In an interview, Etheridge disagreed, saying his court never
really had jurisdiction over the case so ``anything we did would be
a nullity.''
   Therefore, the judge said, Joiner had no reason to withhold his
information ``except to delay things.''
   Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr., a Yale Law School professor of legal
ethics who was the main draftsman of the American Bar Association's
model code of ethics, said Joiner was under no obligation to tell
the judge what he knew.
   ``Clearly not. He had an obligation not to say anything,''
Hazard said.
   ``The defendant in a criminal case is permitted to require the
state to go to its proof on every possible issue, and it's the
state's responsibility to carry the burden in that respect,'' he
said. ``The defendant did nothing to mislead the prosecution, and I
think (Joiner) did the right thing.''
   If he wins his argument that Schiefelbein cannot be tried again,
Joiner said, it will not be a case of an obviously guilty man going
free. He said Schiefelbein, the victim, Michael G. Hadden, and
others in the house had been drinking. No one present at first
thought Hadden's wound was serious enough to summon help, Joiner
said, raising the possibility he might have died from a lack of
medical attention.
   Schiefelbein also contends Hadden was choking him, he said.
   Roberts said the DeKalb County district attorney's office will
not decide whether to prosecute Schiefelbein until his case file
and the judge's order are received from Fulton County.

   Republican George Bush has received more than
twice as much political action committee money as any other active
presidential candidate, says a report issued Wednesday.
   Nearly a quarter of the $570,045 in PAC contributions to the
vice president's campaign came from groups representing the banking
and finance industry. One is associated with a bank that is being
aided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   First RepublicBank Corp. reported Tuesday that it suffered a
$1.5 billion loss in the first three months of 1988, one of the
largest first-quarter losses ever in the banking industry. In 1987,
the bank reported losses of $656 million, prompting the FDIC to
launch a bailout and inject $1 billion into the institution.
   The bank's PAC contributed $1,000 to the Bush campaign and $500
to Democratic candidate Albert Gore Jr., according to Wednesday's
report by Congress Watch, an arm of Public Citizen, a liberal
organization founded in 1971 by consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
   The group based its report on Federal Election Commission
documents on campaign contributions through Feb. 29.
   Joe Bowles, a spokesman for First RepublicBank, said the PAC
donations are ``voluntary individual contributions. ... They have
nothing to do with the company's finances.''
   ``By law, a corporation cannot contribute to a political
campaign,'' he said.
   Gore was first among the Democrats with $210,655 in PAC money,
including $25,300 from the banking and finance industry and $11,487
from law firms' political action committees.
   Jesse Jackson was second with $42,350, including $34,750 from
labor union PACs.
   He received $3,000 from a PAC associated with the Coca-Cola
Bottling Co., $5,000 from one associated with the United Auto
Workers and $5,000 from the Teamsters Drive Political Fund.
   The other active Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, has said he does not accept PAC money.
   Among the other contributors to the Bush campaign were the
Oppenheimer PAC, $5,000; Auctions Market, which represents the
Chicago Board of Trade, $5,000, and PACs associated with Allied
Bank, $5,000, and Norstar Bank Corp., $5,000. In all, Bush received
$125,290 from the banking and finance industry, according to the
report.
   The Bush campaign also received money from PACs representing
major law firms, including $2,000 from Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro
and $1,000 from Mayor, Day & Caldwell.
   Among insurance companies, the Mutual of Omaha PAC contributed
$3,000 to the Bush campaign and Provident Life's political action
committee gave $1,000. The Gitney PAC in the food and agriculture
industry contributed $1,000 to the Bush campaign and the Flowers
PAC gave $5,000.
   Contributors to Gore's campaign included the Good Government
Fund of Third National Corp., $5,000, and PACs representing First
Alabama Bank Shares, $1,000, and First American Corp., $2,500.
   The Tennessee senator also received $1,000 from a political
action committee representing the Washington law firm of Arnold &
Porter and $2,250 from one associated with Kutak, Rock & Campbell.
   A PAC representing Aetna Life & Casualty, an insurance company,
contributed $1,000 to the Gore campaign, and the American Family
PAC gave $5,000. Gore also received PAC money from Occidental
Petroleum, $5,000; Warner Communications, $1,000, and Pacific
Telesis, $1,500.
   Election law limits each PAC to contributions of no more than
$5,000 to any one candidate, in contrast to the limit for
individual contributions of $1,000.

   The Chinese legislature ended its annual session
Wednesday with tributes to retiring leaders and promises from the
new ones to make economic development their top priority.
   The National People's Congress completed the business of its
20-day session by approving laws promising company managers and
foreign joint ventures freedom from government interference in
making business decisions.
   The delegates also voted to make Hainan Island in the South
China Sea a new province and a special economic zone intended to
attract foreign high-tech joint ventures.
   The congress, made up of 2,970 delegates who serve five-year
terms, was characterized by unprecedented criticism of China's vast
economic and social problems and by a strong commitment to the
economic and political reform program of senior leader Deng
Xiaoping.
   ``The present congress should make it its primary duty to ensure
and promote reform,'' newly elected congress Chairman Wan Li said
in a speech to the closing session in the Great Hall of the People.
   Wan's predecessor, Peng Zhen, was a harsh critic of the reforms
and growing Western cultural influences that have accompanied them,
including pressure for democratacy.
   Wan thanked a sour-looking Peng for having increased the
influence of the National People's Congress. Peng helped draft a
new constitution in 1982 that gave the congress the power to enact
laws.
   The new president, Yang Shangkun, a close ally of Deng, also
paid tribute to his predecessor, Li Xiannian, 78, who asked to
retire.
   The delegates voted by a show of hands to approve the laws and a
series of work reports delivered to the congress. One to three
delegates voted ``no'' on nearly every item, including the keynote
report delivered by acting Premier Li Peng on the congress' opening
day.
   Three delegates voted against the report and six abstained. The
official Xinhua News Agency said the approved version contained 100
amendments to the one Li originally delivered and included a new
emphasis on protecting the autonomy of China's minority groups.
   At a rare news conference later Wednesday in the Great Hall, Li
told reporters the report was drafted collectively by the top
leadership, he dismissed foreign news reports that he and Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang clashed over its content and tone.
   Zhao is an enthusiastic supporter of rapid modernization, while
Li has stressed the need to move cautiously.
   ``Zhao and I have no differences on political issues,'' Li said.
``There is some comment in the foreign press that Zhao favors
reform ... and I'm in favor of stabilizing the economy. They
somehow pit these two views agaist each other.''
   The 59-year-old Li also denied that his rapid rise in politics
was due to nepotism. Li, orphaned at age 3, was adopted and raised
by the late Premier Chou En-lai, one of China's most popular
leaders.
   ``I think my promotion has nothing to do with him,'' Li said.
   There was heavy coverage in the official media of congress
delegates demanding stronger government action to solve such
problems as inflation, stagnating grain production and a shortfall
of education funds.
   Li promised that the government and party would ``try to
formulate solutions.''
   He also said the leadership welcomed the comments of university
students who in the past week held a low-key sit-in in Tiananmen
Square calling for more money for education.

   Black Denison University students called
off a two-day boycott of classes Wednesday after the school's
president stiffened the punishment for two white students found
guilty of racial harassment.
   The Black Student Union, which had called the boycotts Monday
and Tuesday, suspended the action after university President Andrew
De Rocco ordered the two whites to leave the campus for the
remainder of the semester.
   The students, who have not been identified by the university,
were given until 5 p.m. Wednesday to leave.
   The University Judicial Board, comprised of four students and
four faculty members, had earlier found the white students guilty
of racial harassment of a black student and ordered the whites be
suspended for the 1988 fall term. That suspension will remain in
effect, but De Rocco on Tuesday night announced the additional
sanctions.
   ``The issues raised by this case have led to an expression of
intense feelings on the campus among students, faculty and others,
to an interruption of classes and to an atmosphere that is not
conducive to the orderly processes of student and faculty life,''
De Rocco said.
   The two white students were accused of harassing Aaron Laramore,
a black senior from Toledo. Laramore claimed in a complaint he
filed against the students that they pounded on the wall between
their room and his and yelled racial epithets.
   The white students testified in their judicial board hearing
that their remarks came in a private conversation. But the Black
Student Union said the slurs were aimed at Laramore, the
dormitory's head resident.
   Most students continued to attend classes during the two-day
boycott, which was accompanied by rallies to protest campus racism
and the initial one-semester suspensions.
   Bheki Khumalo, a member of the Black Student Union, said
Wednesday said the group was not fully satisfied with the
university's latest action, but believed the protest had
accomplished its goal.
   ``Evidently, this was the best the president could do,'' Khumalo
said. ``We've laid the foundation for more things to come on our
campus.''
   About 80 of Denison's 2,100 undergraduates are black, according
to the university, a liberal arts school about 25 miles northeast
of Columbus.

<HEAD>Study Finds Same Satisfaction for Teens in Relinquishing Or

   A study of teen-age mothers concludes that those
who put their children up for adoption did not suffer significantly
more psychological distress than those who kept their children.
   Mothers in the two groups reported essentially equal levels of
satisfaction with self and life, and said they were generally happy
with their decision about the baby, the study found.
   Researchers cautioned the results would apply only to teen-age
mothers who participate in a pregnancy-counseling program similar
to one used by the 269 mothers in the study.
   In addition, ``it would be wrong to conclude that it is easy for
adolescents to relinquish their children,'' wrote Steven
McLaughlin, Diane Manninen and Linda Winges of Battelle's Health
and Population Research Center in Seattle.
   The federally financed study appears in the current issue of
Family Planning Perspectives.
   It includes 123 mothers who reared their children and 146 who
chose adoption. All gave birth to their first child as an unmarried
teen-ager, and participated in a pregnancy counseling program
affiliated with a large adoption agency that permits communication
between biological and adoptive parents.
   They filled out a questionnaire six months to seven years after
the birth. Researchers considered differences in elapsed time when
comparing the groups.
   Both groups reported moderately positive levels of
self-satisfaction. They did not differ significantly in
life-satisfaction. Child rearers were more likely to call their
lives difficult.
   On a five-point scale to measure satisfaction with their
decision to relinquish or keep the baby, relinquishers averaged
4.35, less satisfied than the 4.69 reported by those who kept their
babies. But both scores are high and the difference ``should be
interpreted with some caution,'' researchers wrote.
   For one thing, adolescents who chose to rear their children will
probably not report regrets because it might be interpreted as not
loving the child, researchers wrote.

   Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore
Jr., in a new round of television ads before New York's Democratic
presidential primary next Tuesday, are stressing their calls for
more action against drugs.
   In the TV spots, Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, urges
``a real war, not a phony war'' on drugs, while Gore, a senator
from Tennessee, says the military should be enlisted in this
battle. Meantime, Jackson, having preached against drugs for years,
reviews his ideas with filmmaker Spike Lee in an ad set to start
Thursday.
   This is the first time Jackson has had enough money for a media
campaign to rival those mounted by Gore and Dukakis and reflects
Jackson's fund-raising success since his strong showings in recent
primaries and caucuses.
   Jackson spokesman Eric Easter said the campaign expected to
purchase TV time worth about $500,000 _ 10 times more than what
Jackson spent on media for the April 5 Wisconsin primary. Dukakis
won in Wisconsin, Jackson ran second and Gore finished third.
   ``We plan to run a number of commercials,'' Easter said. ``We
haven't decided which ones to use and when to run them. We've just
decided a ballpark figure on how much we're willing to spend.''
   Gore spokesman Mark Armour said the campaign made a third media
buy Tuesday and ``we're still intending to run a million-plus
campaign in New York.''
   Steve Akey, a spokesman for Dukakis, declined to disclose how
much the campaign is spending other than saying ``we can be and we
will be competitive with everybody in New York.''
   Asked if Dukakis would match or outspend his rivals, Akey
replied: ``It's not always necessary. We didn't spend the most
money in Wisconsin. You have to be very careful about targeting
your dollar.''
   Dukakis introduced a new ad Tuesday night including excerpts
from a speech in which he attacked the Reagan administration's long
relationship with Panamanian military strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``I'm running for president because I want to see a real war,
not a phony war, against drugs and alcohol dependency in this
country,'' Dukakis says. ``How can we tell our children to say no
to drugs when we have an administration that paid $200,000 a year
to a drug-peddling dictator from Panama?''
   ``A chief executive can make a difference in the fight against
drugs,'' a narrator says, echoing another ad now running in which a
narrator points out that of all the candidates, only Dukakis has
been an executive with a state to run.
   The new Jackson ad shows Jackson and Lee walking down a New York
street. Lee comments on the sad state of the neighborhood and the
devastating impact of drugs on the streets, and Jackson responds by
discussing his anti-drug positions.
   Lee's character in his movie, ``She's Gotta Have It,'' mentions
having met Jackson and told him to run for president, according to
Easter. He said Lee has been a Jackson supporter for some time.
   Gore is using an ad stressing his experience as a Vietnam
veteran and another proposing that the military be mobilized to
fight drugs. He added a new spot Tuesday night on trade.

   Jewish leaders on Wednesday assailed as
anti-Semitic political ads appearing in Boston subway cars that
feature a photograph of Israeli soldiers subduing an Arab and the
words ``Your tax dollars pay for the violence.''
   The 200 advertising cards are on subway cars of the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Together, Boston-area
chapters of the Mobilization for Survival, the American Friends
Service Committee and the Lebanon Emergency Committee paid $2,300
for the month-long ad campaign, which began last week.
   The sponsors say their message is only an attack on U.S. policy
in Israel and an endorsement of self-determination for
Palestinians. But rabbis and other leaders among greater Boston's
180,000 Jews say the ads are racist.
   The advertisements include a photograph of seven Israeli
soldiers, guns raised, subduing a Palestinian youth. Unrest on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip has continued since late last year.
   The accompanying text reads: ``Your tax dollars pay for the
violence in the Israeli Occupied Territories. Since December,
thousands of Palestinians have been shot, beaten and tear-gassed by
the Israeli military. Every year the U.S. sends more than $4
billion in military and economic aid to Israel. Isn't it time to
speak out? No aid for the occupation.''
   Rabbi Richard Yellin of Congregation Mishkan Tefila in Newton
called the ads ``blatantly anti-Zionist, blatantly anti-America.''
   Yellin said he tried to get the transit authority to remove the
ads. But he gave up in the face of arguments that the First
Amendment right of free expression protects the ads and the people
who put them up.
   Vincent Carbona, spokesman for the transit authority, said the
advertisements were installed after legal advisers approved them.
   Yellin said the only recourse is to take out new ads in a
counter-attack, but he discarded that idea as likely to inflame the
issue out of proportion. ``It's not worth it. It's a low-brow, a
bumper-sticker mentality.''
   Philip Perlmutter, executive director of the Jewish Community
Relations Council of Greater Boston, called the ad campaign ``to me
a brazen example of propaganda and hypocrisy. These people have
never spoken up about the violence of Arabs against Arabs.''
   Melani McAlister, Middle East staffer at Mobilization for
Survival in Cambridge, denied charges the ads attack Jews.
   ``We really believe we're standing with Israelis and with Jews
and Palestinians who support peace and a negotiated peace,'' Ms.
McAlister said.
   ``People would have to distort what's there to see it as
anti-Semitic,'' she said, adding that the organization also works
to combat anti-Semitism and racism. ``People have to learn to
separate Israeli government policy and Jews.''
   Joseph Gerson, a Jew and a spokesman for the American Friends
Service Committee, called the charges of anti-Semitism ridiculous.
   ``People have to be able to criticize the policies of a
government state, and what the poster does is call attention to the
occupation,'' Gerson said.
   The American Friends Service Committee is run by Quakers to
promote various ideals such as peace and social justice, said
another spokesman, Robert Dove. Membership is open to non-Quakers
as well as Quakers.

   Millionare industrialist Jon Huntsman left
the race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination Wednesday as
abruptly as he entered it, throwing his support behind Gov. Norm
Bangerter.
   Huntsman, red-eyed and looking tired, announced he was
withdrawing in order to help restore Republican unity and pursue
new opportunities to develop his $1-billion-per-year Huntsman
Chemicals Corp.
   Huntsman's surprise decision came one day before he was to
formally announce his candidacy for governor and 30 days after he
had stunned the party faithful by challenging Bangerter for the
nomination.
   Bangerter has been trailing Democratic challenger Ted Wilson in
polls.
   Without mentioning him by name, Huntsman blamed his withdrawal
in part on Merrill Cook, a former Republican who left the party to
launch an independent bid for governor. Cook's tax-cutting platform
has drawn support from the party's ultra-conservative right wing.
   ``When I entered the race, I never envisioned a lengthy,
fragmented party division and never anticipated Republicans bolting
the party to run as independents,'' Huntsman said.
   Just last week Huntsman's campaign had launched a $268,000
television and radio campaign to improve Huntsman's name
identification among voters before the April 25 state party
caucuses, where delegates to the Junne state convention are elected.
   Huntsman, 50, former aide in the Nixon White House, had
personally loaned his campaign $100,000 while awaiting arrival of
some $200,000 in pledges made the day after the March 15
announcement he was entering the race.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas will face a two-term Republican

state Assembly seat.
   In other elections Tuesday, singer-turned-restaurateur Sonny
Bono picked up where Clint Eastwood left off, becoming mayor of
Palm Springs, Calif., the same day voters in Carmel, Calif., were
choosing a replacement for Eastwood as their mayor.
   And in Vicksburg, Miss., the scene of a famous Civil War battle,
a black county supervisor won a runoff over a white businessman to
become the city's first elected black mayor. Robert Major Walker,
former state director of the state National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said he expects to take office in
about two weeks.
   Rep. Beau Boulter of Amarillo won the GOP nomination for Senate
in a primary runoff in Texas on Tuesday, defeating Houston
businessman Wes Gilbreath by 111,683 votes, or 60.1 percent, to
74,029, or 39.9 percent. He will face Bentsen, a Democratic
powerhouse who has held office since 1971, in November.
   In Washington, Bentsen issued a statement congratulating
Boulter. ``The real race starts now that each party has chosen its
nominee,'' he said. ``I expect a hard-fought campaign.''
   In San Francisco, former U.S. Rep. John Burton, who left
Congress because of a cocaine addiction in 1982, defeated a
homosexual activist lawyer in a special election for the remainin
term in the state Assembly seat vacated when Art Agnos became
mayor. It's the same state Assembly seat Burton held from 1965 to
1975.
   Burton, 55, is also on the June Democratic primary ballot for a
full Assembly term. Once again, his opponent will be the woman he
defeated Tuesday, Roberta Achtenberg, 37. He received 20,550 votes,
or 52.2 percent, to 14,341 votes, or 36.5 percent, for Ms.
Achtenberg.
   Bono, the former husband and singing partner of Academy
Award-winning actress Cher, was elected mayor of Palm Springs, a
desert resort 110 miles east of Los Angeles where he owns a
restaurant.
   He swamped his closest competitor by almost a 2-1 margin in the
seven-candidate race, with 4,842 votes to 2,498 for accountant
Lloyd Maryanov.
   Farther north, Eastwood had decided not to seek a second
two-year term as mayor of Carmel. Voters there elected community
activist Jean Grace, who had Eastwood's endorsement. She got 1,144
votes, while her chief challenger, Clayton Anderson, tallied 868.
   In Vicksburg, Walker, 44, received 3,556 votes, or 52 percent,
against opponent Jack Branning's 3,300, or 48 percent. Absentee
ballots were still being tallied but were not expected to change
the outcome.
   Walker said he'll resign as Warren County supervisor to take
over the mayor's office, which was left vacant when Demery Grubbs,
in office for eight years, resigned to work for the Mississippi
Municipal Association. A six-candidate field had been narrowed to
Walker and Branning in an election April 5.
   Walker will serve the balance of Grubbs' term until June 30,
1989. The job pays $37,306 per year.
   Texas voters also decided on three congressional nominations.
   Panhandle Republicans picked former Amarillo Chamber of Commerce
president Larry Milner over Bob Price of Pampa for the U.S. House
seat vacated by Boulter. He faces Democratic state Sen. Bill
Sarpalius.
   On the Democratic side, attorney Wayne Walker of Fresno, Texas,
beat teacher Richard Konrad of Houston for a chance to face 22nd
District incumbent Rep. Tom DeLay. In the 6th District, contractor
N.P. ``Pat'' Kendrick of Joshua defeated farmer John E. Welch of
Waxahachie to face Republican incumbent Rep. Joe Barton.

<HEAD>Navy Faulted on Handling Spare Parts Stockpiles</HEAD>

   The Navy is doing a poor job of keeping
records about the millions of items in service inventories of spare
parts and needs to improve its bookkeeping procedures, a
congressional watchdog agency said Wednesday.
   The service is doing a better job than it used to, but it's
still not good enough, said the review by the General Accounting
Office.
   ``The Navy's accounting situation is like a bank forgetting how
much money it loaned out, then asking the borrowers how much they
owe,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which asked for the GAO review.
   The review centered on the Naval Supply Center at Norfolk, Va.,
and the Ships Parts Control Center in Mechanicsburg, Pa.
   The survey was the latest in a series of GAO studies of Defense
Department recordkeeping and inventory control done for the
committee. Over the past four years, the panel has focused on
trying to improve the Pentagon's management of its vast stockpile
of spare parts and other items.
   In fiscal 1986, the GAO found, the Norfolk center had a record
accuracy rate of 69 percent, meaning that records for almost
one-third of the items were erroneous.
   ``With a value of roughly $28 billion, the Navy's inventory of
supply items and repair parts is a significant investment in our
national defense,'' said Glenn.
   ``These supplies must be well-managed and ready for delivery on
short notice. We simply cannot tolerate accounting inefficiences
that could undermine the Navy's ability to perform its duty. We
need effective supply operations on shore if we are to have
effective ship operations at sea.''
   At Mechanicsburg, officials couldn't account for all the items
sent to contractors or to other facilities for work, meaning the
items could have been stolen or lost, the GAO said. The center did
not maintain adequate stock or financial records, it said.
   In a response that was part of the GAO review, the Pentagon
generally agreed with the GAO's recommendations, but disputed the
criticism.
   In the GAO's criticism of both Navy facilities, ``the report
exaggerates the significance of observed incidents and does not
recognize the existence of effective management programs,'' said
Robert Costello, assistant secretary of defense for production and
logistics.
   The GAO said the Pentagon should improve administrative
management of the two centers, including requirements that better
records be kept.

<HEAD>Private Pension Plans Lost $135 Billion in Market Crash, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's private pension funds lost $135
billion or 10.4 percent of their assets in the Oct. 19 stock market
crash and its wake, a private research group said Wednesday.
   The fourth-quarter 1987 loss _ the largest in five years _
helped reduce the total assets of 800,000 pension plans covering 40
million active and retired workers from $1.3 trillion to $1.12
trillion, the Employee Benefit Research Institute said.
   Net capital losses of $152 billion resulting primarily from the
25 percent decline in stock prices were partially offset by
dividend payments and interest income of $18 billion, the institute
said.
   Despite the fourth-quarter losses, the nation's private pension
plans still finshed 1987 with $37.6 billion more in assets,
including $29.2 billion in total capital gains for the year, than
they had at the end of 1986.
   Altogether, the pension plans sold off a net $5 billion or about
1 percent of their stock holdings in response to the crash, the
institute said.
   Larger plans with total assets of at least $75 million joined
the selling spree in reaction to the crash more than smaller plans.
The large plans sold a net $6.8 billion or 4 percent of their
equity holdings in the fourth quarter.
   The smaller plans, apparently finding several bargains in the
depressed stock prices, showed net purchases of $1.8 billion for
the quarter.
   The institute's data indicates that some pension plan managers
had anticipated a downturn in the stock market, selling off a total
of $34 billion in stock during the first three quarters of 1987.
   The crash did have two significant impacts on pension plans,
according to the data.
   First, the declining stock prices reduced the equity share of
their portfolios from 40 percent to 36 percent. And the plans paid
out $45.5 billion more in benefits than they took in in
contributions during the quarter.

   Entertainment columnist Forrest Duke,
whose ``Duke of Las Vegas'' column once ran in 21 newspapers
nationwide, died Wednesday following a long bout with emphysema.
   He was 69.
   ``He was very powerful in show business circles, but he was very
careful how he used that power and how he spoke about
entertainers,'' said Jim Seagrave, publicity director at the
Frontier Hotel. ``He was on a first-name basis with every big name
in the business, but he always took time out to cover the
newcomers. So many times it was his mention of these newcomers that
gave them their first big break.''
   Duke was the entertainment columnist for the Las Vegas
Review-Journal until his retirement in April 1986. He was honored
shortly after his retirement in a farewell gala hosted by more than
two dozen entertainment personalities as well as fellow journalists
and hotel executives.
   Duke, who wrote a column for 28 years, died at Desert Springs
Hospital.
   Duke is survived by his wife, Florence; two sons; three
grandchildren; a niece and three nephews.

   The mother of 7-month-old twins conceived
under a surrogacy contract has agreed to surrender custody to the
Arkansas man who contracted for their birth, attorneys said
Wednesday.
   The agreement averts a custody trial scheduled to begin next
week.
   Laurie Yates of Ithaca, Mich., and Barry Huber of Jonesboro,
Ark., reached settlement late Tuesday, said attorney Kathleen Boyle.
   ``Under the terms of the settlement, Barry Huber has legal and
physical custody of the children. They'll reside with him and his
wife Glinda in Arkansas,'' she said.
   Mrs. Yates will be allowed to see the twins once a year, said
Lisa Vogler, one of the lawyers who represented the surrogate
mother in her suit to keep the twins.
   ``Nobody was bought off, nobody was bought out of the suit,''
said attorney Robert MacAlpine, who negotiated the settlement for
Mrs. Yates and her husband Richard. ``It was probably the ultimate
act of love on Laurie Yates's part.
   ``They realized that in their precarious financial condition
they could never provide the kind of home for the twins that the
Hubers could,'' he said. Both are unemployed.
   Boyle said she did not know when the Hubers would be able to
take the twins home.They were placed in foster care on Saturday to
protect them from stress and attention during the trial that was to
have begun next week. Before that, the babies divided their time
between the two families, spending two weeks at a time with each.
   Mrs. Yates sued for custody before the twins were born.
   She had a mid-pregnancy change of heart about surrogate
parenting and decided she could not give up her children.
   Earlier this year, Gratiot County Circuit Judge Timothy Green
declared the surrogate contract unenforceable, so the trial would
only have determined which set of parents was most fit to raise the
twins.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Jesse Jackson Critics Fear Any Attack Will Be Labeled
Racist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Wednesday that Jesse
Jackson has been spared criticism in the presidential campaign out
of fear that any comments would be misinterpreted as ``some kind of
racial attack.''
   ``It seems that more attention is being paid to the difference
in color than is being paid to what he is actually saying,'' Reagan
told the American Society of Newspaper Editors convention.
   ``I just regret that this has become a factor,'' he said.
   It was the first time Reagan had commented on the sensitive
question of how race has become an issue in the 1988 presidential
contest. Jackson, a black leader, is waging a neck-and-neck battle
with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for the Democratic
nomination.
   Emphasizing his own stand, Reagan said, ``I find a great
disagreement with some of the things'' proposed by Jackson, who has
advocated deep cuts in Pentagon spending and an array of costly
social programs.
   Reagan made his comments in a speech and a question and answer
session with the audience. He also made these points:
   _He did not know until recently that his former spokesman, Larry
Speakes, had made up quotes in 1983 and 1985 and passed them to
reporters as Reagan's own words. Speakes makes the disclosure in
his new book, ``Speaking Out.''
   Reagan said he reads the newspapers every day, but he did not
explain how he missed reading what Speakes had done.
   ``I can tell you right now that I have no affection for these
kiss-and-tell books that are being written and I find it entirely
fiction,'' Reagan said. Another longtime aide, Michael K. Deaver,
published an insider book about Reagan last year, and another by
former chief of staff Donald T. Regan is due out in May.
   In his speech, Reagan quipped that one of the nice things about
his job is that ``you get to quote yourself shamelessly, and if you
don't, Larry Speakes will.'' The audience laughed.
   _He expects Afghan rebels to continue fighting the Marxist
regime in Kabul despite an agreement being signed Thursday for the
withdrawal of 115,000 Soviet forces after an eight-year occupation.
   Reagan said there is nothing in the agreement that prevents the
United States from supplying the rebels ``as long as they need it
and as long as the Soviet Union continues to supply the Afghan
forces in their puppet government.''
   _The U.S. banking system ``has some troubles.'' But Reagan also
said, ``I don't think it is a problem that could suddenly bring
disaster down upon us.''
   Discussing politics, Reagan acknowledged the Republican
presidential race is down to one, Vice President George Bush, but
he did not give Bush his endorsement, saying there still is a
convention to be held.
   He spoke about Jackson when a member of the audience asked him
to assess civil rights in America in a year in which a black man is
running for president.
   ``I hope that race will not be a part of this campaign in any
way,'' Reagan said.
   ``But I'm sorry that in the campaign that's going on with one
candidate of the black race, that it seems that more attention is
being paid to the difference in color than is being paid to what he
is actually saying,'' the president said.
   ``And I have to believe that a great many of us would find
ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that he is
proposing and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it wasn't
concern that that'd be misinterpreted into some kind of a racial
attack,'' Reagan added.
   Defending his own record, Reagan said one of the most
frustrating things he has encountered is the charge that he is ``in
some way a racist and prejudiced with regard to racial matters.''
He said he has battled all his life for the removal of racial
barriers.
   Saying race has become a factor in the presidential race, Reagan
said, ``The candidates should all be based on what are their
policies and what is it that they would propose to do.''
   He said his opposition to Jackson's policies is the reason ``why
I've suggested everybody support a Republican.''
   Reagan refused to hazard any guess on the outcome of the
Democratic contest.
   ``I don't know whether the candidates now campaigning, whether
any one of them is going to wind up at the convention with the
nomination or whether there will be a brokered convention or
whether the Democratic Party will go afield seeking to draft
someone who has not been campaigning in the primaries,'' Reagan
said.

   President Reagan said Wednesday he did not
learn until recently that his former spokesman, Larry Speakes, had
put words in his mouth on at least two occasions while briefing
reporters on presidential meetings.
   Reagan did not directly answer, however, when asked whether he
approved of the practice or would allow it to continue. His current
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, has condemned any such procedure and
said he never would do it.
   Speakes says in his new book, ``Speaking Out,'' that he once
attributed remarks made by Secretary of State George P. Shultz to
the president and once collaborated with an aide in making up
quotes which he then credited to Reagan.
   Reagan's first comment on the book came in a question-and-answer
session after a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Katherine Fanning, editor of the Christian Science Monitor and
president of the editors' group, asked Reagan, ``Did you approve of
that process, and would you continue to allow that to happen in
your White House?''
   ``I was not aware of that and just learned it recently,'' the
president responded, ``as all the rest of you did. And I can tell
you right now that I have no affection for these kiss-and-tell
books that are being written, and I find it entirely fiction.''
   Speakes, in an interview on Tuesday, said, ``I generally told
him what I had done and the reasons for doing it. He never objected
to these cases where I said, `I've gone ahead and done this.'''
   Speakes, who left the White House 14 months ago to become vice
president for communications of the Wall Street firm of Merrill
Lynch, did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.
   George Reedy, who served as a press secretary to President
Johnson, said when asked about the faked quotes, ``The thing that
bothers me is not so much that Larry Speakes did it, but that a
president would let him get away with it.''
   Reedy, now Nieman professor of journalism at Marquette
University, said in a telephone interview late Tuesday, ``It
bothers me very much that the president would allow somebody to
come through and put words in his mouth.''
   Reedy said the misattributed Shultz remarks, which followed the
shooting down of a Korean Air Lines passenger plane in 1983, and
the made-up quotations, attributed to Reagan at the Geneva summit
in 1985, ``are fairly harmless, but that's not the point.''
   ``Suppose those words got the United States embroiled in some
real crisis of some sort,'' he said. ``It's one thing if the
president makes a mistake and gets the nation in a crisis, but to
have a statement drawn up by a technician with the president's name
stamped on it to get us into a crisis is too much.''
   Reagan also made an oblique reference to the Speakes controversy
in a speech to the editors before he answered questions.
   After referrring to a previous speech that he had made, Reagan
said, ``That's one of the nice things about this job. You get to
quote yourself shamelessly, and if you don't, Larry Speakes will.''
   Reagan's reference to ``kiss-and-tell'' books evidently referred
not only to the Speakes book, but to the book, ``Behind the
Scenes,'' by his former deputy chief of staff, Michael K. Deaver,
and a forthcoming volume by former chief of staff Donald T. Regan.
   In his book, Speakes says he quoted Reagan as saying after the
downing of the KAL jet that the incident posed a problem not
between the Soviet Union and the United States but a ``Soviet
versus the world problem.''
   He said that comment really came from Shultz. He said he also
credited Reagan with some suggestions for possible retaliatory
measures, which also had been made by Shultz.
   In the other instance, Speakes at the time quoted Reagan as
telling Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev during their Geneva
summit meetings, ``There is much that divides us, but I believe the
world breathes easier because we are talking here together.''
   He said in the book that he and a press aide, Mark Weinberg,
concocted this quotation.

   An additional 15,000 Soviet troops have been
sent into Afghanistan during the past week, even as the Soviets
prepared to sign a United Nations agreement on the withdrawal of
the Red Army from Afghanistan, administration sources said today.
   At the same time, Soviet armored units, consisting of an
undetermined number of troops and 420 vehicles, including T-72
tanks, armored personnel carriers and mobile rocket launchers,
moved south from Kabul toward the city of Gardez, said intelligence
sources who have been monitoring the fighting. They spoke on
condition they not be further identified.
   The road to Gardez, where a Soviet special forces, or spetsnaz,
regiment is garrisoned, was cut off recently by the Mujahedeen
guerrillas, one source said. The city is 80 miles south of Kabul
and 60 miles from the Pakistani border.
   Some analysts believe the Soviets will withdraw the spetsnaz
unit to Kabul as they begin to pull the Red Army from Afghnistan.
   The advancing column and the spetsnaz regiment are also expected
to attack stockpiles of guerilla armaments.
   Under the Geneva accords, the Soviets are supposed to withdraw
50 percent of their troops within 90 days, and U.S. analysts
believe the Red Army will concentrate in Kabul and around the
northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
   The United Nations brokered agreement on withdrawing the Soviet
troops also calls for ``non-interference and non-intervention'' by
foreign powers in Afghan affairs. And the Soviets are expected to
use that language to pressure Pakistan, despite a separate deal
reportedly worked out between the United States and Soviet Union
under which both will continue to supply the warring Afghan parties.

   Jesse Jackson, delighted with the decision
by Gov. Mario Cuomo to stay out of the endorsement business,
campaigned in upstate New York on Wednesday and was annointed by
the governor as ``a singularly important Democrat'' who could win
in November.
   Cuomo said Jackson was suffering from the ``dumb blonde
syndrome'' in which potential voters think that if a candidate
demonstrates charisma and passion there is little else there.
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' said Cuomo, an
eloquent speaker who has complained in the past about being treated
that way himself. Of Jackson, he said: ``He is making this race a
manifestation of the American idea at its very best.''
   Jackson said he felt it was ``a wise use of power'' for Cuomo
and other party leaders to hold off backing any candidate until
after the primaries. Jackson said such a position encourages ``the
maximum people participation.''
   ``Governor Cuomo, just keep a freeze on all endorsements and
keep extending your support,'' he said.
   Cuomo has pledged not to endorse any of the three Democratic
candidates before next Tuesday's New York primary. That was fine
with Jackson, who may have thought Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis would get Cuomo's nod.
   Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. are locked in a battle with
Dukakis for the lion's share of the 255-delegate prize in New York.
A big victory could propel Dukakis to the nomination. Cuomo aides
said the governor expects to appear later with Gore and Dukakis.
   Cuomo has said he will get behind the front-runner after the
primaries and help that person collect enough uncommitted support
to win the nomination and thus avoid a deadlocked convention.
   Cuomo told Jackson that the fact ``you can get to be president,
or so close, that they put your face on the front page of national
magazines just to explain this phenomenon; that is extraordinary
progress.''
   ``I haven't heard a candidate address that subject as
consistently, as intelligently as Jesse Jackson,'' said Cuomo of
Jackson's message on combatting drug abuse.
   Asked whether Jackson should be guaranteed a spot on the ticket,
Cuomo said there should be no guarantees other than that Jackson,
Dukakis or Gore should be the presidential candidate.
   ``I think it would be a good thing to have a Jewish president, a
woman president, an Italian president, a black president; a good
thing to establish, to prove, that it's possible for everybody to
make it ... but I wouldn't make that the criteria,'' said Cuomo of
chosing a ticket.
   During his breakfast speech, Jackson turned to a favorite
campaign theme, that a key to battling drugs was more money for
education and social programs.
   ``Four years at state university costs $30,000, full
scholarship,'' said Jackson. ``Four years at Attica costs $160,000,
full scholarship. ... That's the message.''
   Jackson said he was encouraged to see the other presidential
candidates, both Republicans and Democrats, speaking out on drugs.
But he said they have come late to the cause.
   ``They are sergeants, but I am the bonafide general in this
war,'' he said.

<HEAD>PTL Network: Will Pull Plug On Swaggart If He Returns To Pulpit

<TEXT>
   The PTL Network will drop Jimmy
Swaggart's daily television shows if he tries to return to church
and television pulpits May 22, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   The network is currently broadcasting Swaggart's show with
substitute ministers.
   ``There's no doubt it is one of our better accounts. It's not a
decision that we would make lightly,'' David West of the PTL
Network in Charlotte, N.C., said in a telephone interview.
   However, West said, PTL has a waiting list of other people who
want time on the cable network, which he said reaches an estimated
12 million homes.
   Last week, the Assemblies of God defrocked Swaggart because he
refused to accept a one-year suspension from preaching because of
his involvement with a prostitute.
   Swaggart said Friday that the finances of his church and the
Jimmy Swaggart Bible College couldn't stand up under a one-year
suspension. He said he was returning to both his church and
television ministries on May 22.
   Earl Weirich, with the Christian Broadcasting Network in
Virginia Beach, Va., said officials there will decide Tuesday
whether to continue televising Swaggart's programs.
   He said CBN, which reaches an estimated 39 million homes, got a
mixed bag of calls at the start of the Swaggart controversy.
   ``Right now we are receiving very little interest. There are a
surprising few letters and phone calls,'' he said.
   He said it's a marked contrast to what happened when the network
considered canceling a children's show.
   ``A while back we talked about cutting off a kids' show on our
network and we were flooded with thousands of calls. It was like an
avalanche.''
   West said Swaggart's television show ``A Study in the Word,'' is
shown three times daily on PTL and there is another Swaggart
telecast shown once on Saturday and Sunday.
   A cable television official said Swaggart could buy time on
dozens of individual television stations to make up for the loss of
a network. However, that would be an expensive and cumbersome
project, the official said.

<HEAD>Additional 350,000 Tons Sold To China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Exporters have sold China an additional
350,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery
this year, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The sales, equal to about 12.8 million bushels, were handled by
four companies: Continental Grain Co., 35,000 tons; Cargill Inc.,
215,000; Artfer Inc., 35,000; and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 65,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the sales were part of an
authorized 2 million tons of wheat announced April 5 under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, and some left over from an
earlier authorization.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $2.79
per bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $36 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   China bought more than 4.9 million tons of wheat under previous
EEP arrangements, which allow exporters to sell commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonuses due the four companies averaged $28.28 per
ton, or about 77 cents per bushel of wheat. The bonuses will be
paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.
   China has more than 1.9 million tons remaining for use under the
EEP initiative announced on April 5, he said.

<HEAD>International Panel Begins Televised Waldheim Inquiry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international panel of judges began a televised
inquiry Wednesday into whether Austrian President Kurt Waldheim
should be charged with Nazi war crimes or is a victim of rumors.
   About 40 witnesses are scheduled to testify in nine days before
the panel, which includes Shirley Hufstedler, a former justice of
the U.S. Court of Appeals and the education secretary under former
President Jimmy Carter.
   Thirteen German army World War II veterans who served alongside
the young Waldheim when he was a lieutenant in the Balkans are
among those scheduled to address the panel.
   Reporters are being allowed to watch some of the proceedings,
but reporting on them will be embargoed until a date to be
announced by co-producers Home Box Office and Britain's Thames
Television. The hearings will be edited to 3{ hours for screening
in Britain and the United States on June 5.
   In a studio-turned-courtroom at Thames' London headquarters, the
five judges will try to decide whether Waldheim is a victim of
rumor and exaggeration, or whether there is foundation to
allegations linking the former U.N. secretary-general to war crimes.
   Thames and HBO said six months of research have produced new
evidence and witnesses that weren't available to an international
historians' commission that investigated Waldheim's wartime
activities.
   That commission said in its February report that Waldheim was in
close proximity to Nazi atrocities but did nothing to stop them. It
left open the question of whether he was guilty of war crimes
himself, but it said he had concealed his wartime past.
   The producers of ``Waldheim _ A Comission of Inquiry,'' say the
$2.8 million project will be the most serious analysis yet of the
case against Waldheim.
   ``This is unique,'' said Telford Taylor, the U.S. chief
prosecutor at the 1946 Nuremburg trials and a program consultant.
   Some of Adolf Hitler's top commanders and perpetrators of
atrocities were sentenced at Nuremburg.
   Sensitive to charges of trial-by-television, the producers and
lawyers involved insisted at a news conference that the documentary
is an inquiry, not a mock trial.
   ``We will try to separate rumor, speculation and possible
fiction from fact,'' said retired British appeal judge, Sir
Frederick Lawton, the chairman of the judges' panel.
   ``We may not succeed, but we hope to go a long way to establish
what really happened.''
   Producer Jack Saltman said 24 researchers, including one who
``read through the entire West German telephone directory,'' had
tracked witnesses and collected 15,000 pages of material from 11
countries.
   Hufstedler and Lawton are joined by three other retired judges _
West German Walter Hubner, Canadian Gordon Cooper and Swede Gustav
Petren.
   Presenting the evidence is a Harvard lawyer and former director
of the U.S. Justice Department's Nazi-hunting Office of Special
Investigations, Allan A. Ryan. Challenging the evidence is Lord
Rawlinson, Britain's former attorney general.
   No one will represent the character of Waldheim, but Saltman
said he told the president about the proposed documentary in a
personal interview last summer.
   ``He said something to the effect that nobody but the Austrian
people could try him, and by electing him president they had given
their opinion,'' said Saltman.
   ``He also said that if I and what he called the Waldheim
industry searched for 100 years, we wouldn't find anything.''
   Producers said no attempt would be made to embellish the
proceedings with artificial drama.
   ``I don't think anyone's going to get rich on this, and there
are no movie stars,'' Bridget Potter, HBO's senior vice president
for original programming, said in a telephone interview from New
York. ``But certainly in this country, there's never been a real
examination on a broad level of the evidence against Kurt
Waldheim.''
   The allegations against Waldheim were raised in 1986, during his
presidential campaign. The president denied wrongdoing, and the
historians' panel that presented the February report was convened
at his request.

<HEAD>SEC Chief Endorses Move To Allow Banks Into Securities Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Wednesday said he endorsed far-reaching legislation
to permit banks to enter the securities business as long as
consumers are protected adequately.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told the House telecommunications
and science subcommittee that the commission supports the
Senate-passed repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act ``as long as the
investor protection concerns arising from the entry of banks into
securities activities are simultaneously addressed.''
   Glass-Steagall is a Depression-era law that separated banking
from the securities business in the aftermatth of the 1929
financial crash.
   Ruder told subcommittee chairman Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., that
the commission has accepted the safeguards in the bill sponsored by
Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee.
   But he said that under ideal conditions the SEC would solely
regulate banks dealing in securities and not share the
responsibility with the Federal Reserve Board.
   If eventually signed into the law, the bill, which passed the
Senate 94-2 on March 30, would grant banks immediate power to
underwrite mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and
municipal revenue bonds. Banks would be able to deal in mutual
funds and corporate bonds six months after enactment.
   In a concession to the securities industry, the bill withholds
power from banks to underwrite corporate stock _ viewed by senators
as the riskiest securities area _ unless Congress authorizfes that
in a separate vote in April 1991.
   In conjunction with the new securities powers, the bill would
erect ``fire walls'' limiting loans and other connections between
banks and their securities affiliates to prevent risky investment
activities from endangering federally insured bank deposits.
   In the House, a more restrictive bill has been circulated by
Banking Committee Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.
   Banking interests are strongly opposed to the St Germain draft,
which would grant much more limited securities powers and includes
stricter consumer and insurance provisions than the Senate bill.
   Markey, who has indicated he is no hurry to push through the
legislation, said Congress should concentrate on one special
interest, the public.
   ``Deregulation and relaxed supervision make sense as public
policy only if the unfettered market forces they would unleash work
naturally to the benefit of the public,'' Markey said. ``This is
clearly not the case with respect to either our securities markets
or the banking industry.
   ``The plain truth is that in the absence of an adequate
regulatory structure and proper supervisory vigilance, the same
unchecked market forces that gave us program trading, bank failure
after bank failure and continuing market instability will again
have free reign,'' he said.
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader told the subcommittee Congress
should not repeal the provisions of the law which prohibit banks
and bank holding companies from underwriting and dealing with
corporate securities.
   Nader, representing the Center for Study of Responsive Law, said
commercial bank underwriting and dealing in corporate securities
``involves serious conflicts of interest that can injure public
investors, undermine the integrity of capital markets and are not
readily controlled by any realistically available set of
safeguards.''

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said Wednesday that
``drug kingpins'' and people who commit drug-related murders should
be executed, and quickly.
   Bush, winding up a three-day New York campaign swing six days
before the state's primary, also talked with third- and
fourth-graders at a public school in East Harlem, trying a little
French on them during a discussion of homework.
   During a breakfast speech to the Association for a Better New
York, the Republican presidential candidate called for mandatory
death penalties for certain drug-related crimes.
   ``And, frankly, I'd like to find a way to make this penalty
swift,'' he said. ``Only a swift penalty will serve as a true
deterrent.''
   Asked by reporters how punishment could be speeded up without
infringing on a defendant's constitutional rights of due process,
Bush responded: ``Due process is fine, but we've got to find a way
to speed it up. I don't know the answer. I'm not a lawyer.''
   Bush also proposed a drug summit of Western nations and called
for an international anti-drug police force under the auspices of a
global body such as the United Nations.
   He suggested that the three Democratic contenders wouldn't as
aggressive in pursuing drug traffickers as he would. ``I challenge
the Democrats to stand up on this point. You say this is a war;
then treat it as such. Don't let these killers back on the
streets.''
   Bush himself has been criticized by Democratic candidate Jesse
Jackson for offering ``no leadership'' as head of the
administration's South Florida Task Force on Drugs
   And candidate Michael Dukakis unveiled a new television
advertisement Wednesday attacking the Reagan administration for its
previous support of Panamanian military strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``How can we tell our children to say no to drugs when we have
an administration that paid $200,000 a year to a drug-peddling
dictator from Panama?'' the ad says, quoting a Dukakis speech.
   Later Wednesday, Bush planted himself on a stool in the library
of Public School No. 146 in East Harlem and held forth on why he
hopes to be president.
   ``One of the things I like best, I like going into the White
House _ you know, the White House where the president lives and we
work.''
   What does he like about his present job? he was asked.
   ``I've been to a lot of countries. I used to live in China,
although that was before I was vice president. There are so many
exciting things.''
   ``But now, I'm running for president,'' he said.
   Bush got mixed responses from the group of about 25 third- and
fourth-graders to his question: ``How do you feel about homework?''
   ``Well,'' he told the class, ``comme ci, comme ca'' _ a French
phrase often translated in English as ``so-so.''
   Also on Wednesday:
   _Bush called Bill Brock, former campaign manager for Sen. Bob
Dole, to thank him for Brock's announcement that he wanted to be a
volunteer in the Bush campaign.
   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley said Brock ``has already been
helpful to us. He has put the Dole finance people in contact with
our finance people to help in fund-raising. The vice president is
confident there are things he can do and ways in which he can be
helpful.''
   _The vice president said he had played a role in helping to ship
22 tons of newsprint to the newspaper La Prensa in Managua. Bush's
effort was praised in an editorial in that newspaper.
   Teeley said that Bush worked with the State Department in
helping Americare, a private humanitarian organization, to ``cut
through red tape'' and make the shipment possible. ``He believes in
the importance of a free press, particularly in a country that has
had very little in the way of independent dissemination of the
news,'' Teeley said.
   _Bush made brief campaign stops in Buffalo and Rochester before
heading for a fund-raising dinner in Scarsdale at the conclusion of
his three-day swing through New York. He was accompanied in Buffalo
by Rep. Jack Kemp, a former rival for the Republican nomination.

<HEAD>US Officials Concerned That Hijacking Suspect Could Be Freed After
10 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reagan administration officials expressed
concern Wednesday that a suspect in a 1985 TWA jetliner hijacking
and murder of a U.S. Navy diver could be freed after 10 years even
if convicted, under a ruling by a West German court.
   The tribunal in the West German state of Hesse decided this week
to turn the case of Mohammed Hamadi over to a juvenile court to
decide if he should be tried as a minor or as an adult.
   If convicted as an adult he could receive a life term in prison,
but as a juvenile, his maximum sentence would be 10 years.
   ``We are urging that if Germany tries Hamadi in juvenile court,
they try him as an adult, where he could receive the maximum
penalty of life imprisonment in connection with the crimes of the
hijacking including murder and hostage taking,'' Justice Department
spokesman John Russell said.
   ``We would be very disappointed if the court tries Hamadi as a
juvenile, therefore making him eligible for far less severe
punishment,'' he said.
   Hamadi is awaiting trial on charges he led the hijacking of
TWA's Athens-to-Rome flight 847 in June 1985 and forced it to land
in Beirut, where U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot to death.
Hamadi was arrested in Frankfurt in 1987 when he allegedly was
caught at the airport carrying liquid explosives.
   Last year, when West Germany rejected a request that Hamadi be
extradited to stand trial in the United States for Stethem's
murder, U.S. officials consoled themselves with assurances from
Bonn that Hamadi was subject to equally stern punishment if
convicted in Frankfurt or Washington.
   They were consoled again this week that the latest ruling was
not the ultimate decision on Hamadi's possible sentence.
   ``German authorities tell us that even if Hamadi is tried in a
juvenile court he could be sentenced as an adult and receive a life
sentence,'' State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   ``As we've stated before, the Federal Republic of Germany has
given assurances that Hamadi will be prosecuted to the full extent
of German law on all charges associated with the TWA 847 case,
including murder, hijacking and hostage taking as well as crimes
committed in the federal republic,'' Redman said.
   ``We expect the FRG will continue to abide by these assurances
and hope that Hamadi will be tried and sentenced as an adult as he
would were he were tried in the United States,'' the spokesman said.
   Redman said press coverage of the case will be permitted. Most
juvenile proceedings in the United States are closed to reporters.
   Redman noted that under West German law, juvenile courts receive
jurisdiction in cases where there is doubt about whether a
defendant was 21 during all the events leading to a crime.
   The court ruled that Hamadi was born on June 13, 1964, which
would have made him 21 the day the hijacking began, June 14, 1985.
   A court spokesman said, however, ``a possibility exists that the
perpetration of the crime that he is accused of may have begun
before June 13, 1985, and went back to the time of his
adolescence.''
   A State Department terrorism expert, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was difficult to argue with the court's logic,
given the requirements of German law. If the court had rejected the
defendant's request to be tried in a juvenile court and Hamadi were
convicted in an adult tribunal, the conviction might be thrown out
on appeal, the official said.
   Still, this official said, ``there has been some residual
concern in the department about the effect this will have on the
possible sentence.''

   Foster children continue to be neglected and
mistreated despite a law meant to make sure they have safe and
permanent homes, preferably with their own families, Congress was
told Wednesday.
   The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Amendments passed in
1980 are not being enforced by the federal government or the states
and the results are devastating, said Marcia Lowry, director of the
Children's Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``The harm to these kids is immeasurable,'' she told a joint
hearing of two House panels. ``Their ability to form relationships
with adults is destroyed. We are breeding a generation of
psychopaths.''
   Lowry was accompanied by a 12-year-old identified as Boyd A. who
spent years moving from one New York City foster home to another
while his mother, who had been temporarily hospitalized, tried to
get her five children back. It took a class action lawsuit to
reunite the family.
   ``They didn't let us come back because they said she wasn't well
enough. But that wasn't true,'' Boyd said.
   ``Sometimes we didn't like to visit our mother. You know why?
Sometimes they would have to tear us apart. We wouldn't leave. I
couldn't stand it,'' he said. ``They took almost five years away
from my life. That's almost one-half of my whole life that I spent
just waiting to come back to my real family.''
   More than 450,000 children spend some time in foster care each
year as a result of parental illness or disability, parent-child
conflicts, a child's severe emotional or behavioral problems or an
encounter with the law, said Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., acting
chairman of the Ways and Means public assistance subcommittee.
   The foster care population declined by over a third between 1977
and 1984, but it has begun to rise again since then ``despite the
early success of the law,'' said Rep. George Miller, chairman of
the Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. ``We will
attempt to unravel exactly what has gone wrong.''
   The 1980 amendments stress preserving and reuniting families as
well as finding permanent homes for children who cannot return to
their parents. They attempt to protect children in the system by
requiring case plans and case reviews within specific time frames.
   But Lowry said the ACLU, in research for lawsuits in several
states, has found widespread violations of the law and an almost
complete lack of federal enforcement.
   She said states are not monitoring and evaluating cases as
required, are not finding permanent homes for children, are not
providing family services that could prevent the need for foster
care.
   ``Access to adoption is a cruel hoax. It doesn't exist for most
of these kids,'' she said, largely because states are very slow to
move in that direction. By then ``the kids are so old and so
damaged'' by their experiences that they become very hard to place,
she said.
   Lowry also cited the troubling results of a Kansas City review
of 25 foster care cases, chosen randomly. She said 25 percent of
the children had been abused or inappropriately punished and 88
percent of the reports were not properly investigated.
   ``This amazing result violates the state's own procedures'' as
well as a consent decree and sections of two U.S. laws, she said.
   Boyd described several instances of physical abuse and other
problems, including his placement with a Spanish-speaking woman
with whom he could not communicate. Another foster care veteran,
Daryl Morris of Houston, said he was in six homes before finding a
family with whom he spent five years.
   ``I've had to deal with rejection all of my life,'' said Morris,
now 18 and a high school senior. ``It's hard living with different
people and being moved from one place to another. While we were
never physically abused, this was mental abuse ... The scars go
away from your body but not from your mind.''

<HEAD>Committee Report Retains Conditional Acceptance Of Nuclear
Deterrence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report prepared for the nation's Roman
Catholic bishops urges them to stick by their conditional
acceptance of defensive nuclear weapons but questions President
Reagan's Star Wars program, the National Catholic Reporter says.
   A committee headed by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago was
to have submitted the report on its study of morality and nuclear
deterrence during the annual meeting of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops in Washington last November.
   However, Bernardin announced then that the report was being
postponed until spring so the bishops could assess the impact of
the arms control summit meeting at Washington in December.
   Editor Thomas Fox of the National Catholic Reporter, in an
article published in the weekly newspaper's April 15 edition, said
the ad hoc committee report was approved by the bishop's
administrative board at a meeting in Washington last month and will
be debated by the full body of bishops in June.
   The communications office at the Archdiocese of Chicago said no
one was available Wednesday for comment on the report.
   The newspaper said the 63-page committee report contains a
1,000-word pastoral message, a review of the 1983 ``Challenge of
Peace'' pastoral, a look at arms negotiations between the
superpowers in recent years and an analysis of arms race advances.
   ``We are persuaded to renew the judgment of `The Challenge of
Peace' that nuclear deterrence merits only strictly conditioned
acceptance,'' the newspaper quoted the report as saying. ``In a
dangerous world, a world of both wide-spread nuclear knowledge and
extensive nuclear arsenals, we find condemning nuclear deterence
too drastic a solution and embracing it too simple a response.''
   ``We believe that `strictly conditioned acceptance' is the
judgment most appropriate for urging countries, particularly our
own, to plan for and to pursue bilateral and multilateral arms
control and to move toward progressive disarmament.''
   The 1983 pastoral did not address the Reagan administration's
Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars policy, since it was
announced shortly before the bishops released their letter.
   According to the Reporter, the new report questions the wisdom
of Star Wars, saying that while the goal of a defensive system may
sound attractive, it poses a ``collective danger'' and ``leaves us
unconvinced of the merits of proceeding toward deployment.''
   ``Once it is clear that intentions must be measured against
possible consequences, a morally adequate moral framework exists
for the policy debate on SDI,'' the report was quoted as saying.
   Some critics, members of the bishops conference among them, have
criticized even conditional acceptance of nuclear deterrence. For
example, Auxiliary Bishop P. Francis Murphy of Baltimore called
last year for withdrawal of that acceptance, saying it provided a
moral loophole for the nuclear arms race to continue.
   In an editoral, the Reporter criticized the committee report as
a technical document lacking encouragment ``for new energy in the
long and often lonely work of peacemaking.''

   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator
Lee Thomas said Wednesday he backed efforts in Congress to better
regulate cities' incinerator ash, as local officials complained
that current waste standards are unclear.
   Thomas told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that he
supported the approach of a bill by Reps. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio,
that seeks to end confusion over the handling of ash from 140
municipal waste combustors processing about 15 million tons of
refuse each year.
   At issue is whether incinerator ash is to be considered
hazardous or non-hazardous solid waste. Thomas said EPA is looking
to Congress for help on whether ash from waste-to-energy
incinerators should be exempt from stringent hazardous waste
regulations that could mean high cost and lots of paperwork for
communities.
   Currently, the determination of whether a waste is considered
hazardous is based on toxicity tests.
   But confusion over the tests _ for example, how to handle the
varying levels of toxicity in bottom ash versus fly ash _ has
spawned lawsuits, and garbage-handling problems have mounted.
   ``Ordinarily, municipal officials, as I'm sure you well know,
resist and resent endless federal mandates,'' said Beulah
Coughenour, a city council member in Indianapolis who spoke on
behalf of the National League of Cities.
   ``This time we come before you from the opposite perspective. We
are here to ask for exactly that _ federal intervention in an area
that is uniquely a local government responsibility,'' Coughenour
said.
   Carrie S. Perry, mayor of Hartford, Conn., urged the panel to
pass ash legislation ``that provides more clear direction to public
jurisdictions currently facing waste disposal crises.''
   With room for exceptions, Lukens' bill would place incinerator
ash under non-hazardous waste regulations and give states the lead
in enforcing the bill's requirements.
   EPA, however, would be directed to write new regulations for
operating solid waste incinerators, and to develop a new test for
ash residue.
   Thomas said legislative action was needed, and ``the approach
(subcommittee) Chairman Luken has proposed seems to me to be on the
right track.''

<HEAD>U.S. Anti-Tank Weapons Couldn't Stop Soviet Attack, Retired
General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   None of the mainline U.S. anti-tank weapons
would work against Soviet tanks because the Soviet Union is so far
ahead of the United States in producing top-grade armor, Congress
was told Wednesday.
   In addition, Soviet weapons likely would destroy a large part of
America's armored force of tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles
during the first stages of any war, retired Army Gen. Donn Starry
told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee.
   Starry retired last year as commander of the Army's Training and
Doctrine Command, where he specialized in armor systems.
   Three years ago, a Pentagon Defense Science Board concluded not
only that the Soviet Union had the edge over the United States both
in armored protection and in defeating armored protection, but that
the gap was growing worse.
   ``The situation is now a matter of considerable national
urgency,'' Starry said.
   Army officials who testified along with Starry before the Armed
Services conventional forces subcommittee Wednesday agreed with
him, although their assessments were not as quite gloomy.
   ``The Army agreed with the DSB conclusions in 1985 and still
agrees with the conclusion that we are behind the Soviets,'' said
Lt. Gen. Donald S. Pihl, deputy to the assistant secretary of the
Army for research and development. ``We need to regain the lead and
maintain that advantage.''
   The Soviet Union has about a 3-to-1 numerical advantage in
tanks, but U.S. officials have long contended that many of the
Soviet tanks are far older than the modern tanks fielded in Europe
by the United States and its NATO allies.
   In addition, the United States and other NATO armies have tens
of thousands of anti-tank missiles, such as the Dragon, several
varieties of the TOW weapon, and the top-of-the-line Hellfire
missile carried by the Apache anti-tank helicopter.
   Senators were surprised by Starry's assessment.
   ``Are you including Hellfire?'' asked Sen. William Cohen,
R-Maine.
   ``Yes,'' Starry said.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, asked,
``are you saying that if we went to war, our bullets and missiles
would bounce off Soviet tanks?''
   ``That's correct,'' Starry said.
   Starry said the Soviets are fielding a series of tank armors
made of glass and ceramic composites. Atop those armor platings,
the Soviets are putting a series of ``applique boxes,'' which
contain specially designed explosives that blow up when the armor
is hit by an incoming missile. The explosion on the applique box
draws off the explosive energy of the incoming weapon and renders
it less powerful.
   The applique boxes were first fielded by the Israelis about 10
years ago, Starry noted, and were first used in combat during
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   ``The unhappy fact is that tanks with reactive armor on top of
built-in glass composite or ceramic laminate armor will quite
likely defeat the warheads of all deployed'' weapons used by
Western forces, he said.
   Starry also said the Soviets have more effective anti-tank
weapons, meaning they likely would take a high toll among U.S.
tanks during the early stages of any war.
   Last month, Army officials unveiled a plan to improve the armor
on the main U.S. battle, the M-1A1 Abrams, by using depleted
uranium.
   At the time, Army officials said in a statement that move was
``a significant enhancement'' of U.S. armor capabilities and would
``allow the Abrams to meet the anticipated threat well into the
1990s.''
   Asked about that assertion, Starry declined comment in open
session. But speaking later with reporters, he said, ``it's too
early to tell how effective it will be.''
   The Soviet advantage, combined with the new U.S.-Soviet treaty
that will eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe,
poses a grave danger, Starry said.
   ``The Soviets obviously believe that they now have the means to
execute the operational concept they have embraced for so long _
achieve quick, decisive victory at theater level of war, and do so
with such thoroughness and dispatch that the nuclear decision in
the West is yet in abeyance even as they consolidate their theater
level gains.''

   India has been given approval to buy 1.2
million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said India will be
allowed to buy the grain under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. It is the first time India has been eligible to
buy subsidized wheat under the program, although vegetable oil has
been made available.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, exporters can sell specified U.S.
commodities to designated countries at reduced prices in order to
meet foreign competition and then collect free government surpluses
of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Subsidies have ranged from less than $20 to more than $40 per
ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   The Soviet Union also has been a big buyer of U.S. wheat under
EEP, with purchases totaling more than 11.8 million tons in the
last year, and China has bought more than 5 million tons under the
program.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Answering Gore, Says He Might Use Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis, responding to campaign
criticism from Democratic presidential opponent Albert Gore Jr.,
said Wednesday that as president he might use nuclear forces but he
refused to elaborate.
   ``The policy I advocated has been the policy of the government
of the United States for many, many years. It's the policy of the
NATO alliance,'' Dukakis said at a Boston press conference.
   ``If Senator Gore wants to take issue with that policy, he
should do so. But he ought to get his facts straight,'' Dukakis
added.
   He was responding to criticism from Gore, who told an audience
in New York earlier in the day that it was ``unwise and
irresponsible'' for Dukakis to suggest that he would use nuclear
forces to repel a Soviet invasion of Europe.
   Dukakis and his aides insisted that Gore was distorting his
comments.
   And Dukakis dismissed Gore's criticism, insisting that his
position on nuclear weapons was the same as the policy of every
U.S. president in the nuclear era.
   The governor said he would consider the use of nuclear forces as
an option in the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe. But he
refused to spell out the exact circumstances under which he would
definitely use nuclear weapons.
   Dukakis was asked specifically how he would respond as president
if Soviet ground forces overwhelmed Western troops in Europe.
   ``We have always reserved the right to use nuclear force under
those circumstances. That's not saying we're going to do it, but we
have always reserved the right to do so. That has been the policy
of our government. It is the policy of the NATO alliance,'' the
governor said.
   Jack Corrigan, the deputy manager of the Dukakis campaign, was
more blunt in his reaction to Gore's comments.
   ``Senator Gore is shooting from the hip in an act of political
desperation,'' Corrigan said. ``We're just lucky that he's only in
charge of his mouth and not in charge of the button.''
   Gore, who is competing with Dukakis and Rev. Jesse Jackson in
next week's New York primary, said that traditionally candidates
and presidents avoid ``the trap of spelling out in advance'' when
the United States would use nuclear weapons.
   ``One of my opponents said in an interview yesterday that he
would launch a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union if
they invaded Europe with conventional forces,'' Gore said. Dukakis
did not use the phrase ``first strike.''
   In a key passage of the Daily News interview, Dukakis said:
``I'm for a policy of no early first use. But our present strategy
in Europe assumes that if the Soviets were to invade and
conventional forces couldn't stop them that we'd reserve the right
to use nuclear force. I don't think that's going to happen, and in
fact I see the opposite happening. I see a real opportunity now to
bring down the level of conventional forces with the Soviets. I
think Gorbachev is serious about his need to significantly reduce
his commitment of conventional forces. So, I don't think it's going
to happen. But until that happens, we've got to be prepared to use
nuclear force. Obviously, with great restraint and only when there
seems to be no other alternative.''

<HEAD>Critics Charge U.S. Foot-Dragging in Stemming Dolphin Kills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration came under attack
Wednesday for taking four years to implement a 1984 law intended to
reduce sharply the number of dolphins killed by tuna fishing in the
eastern Pacific.
   ``This is an embarrassment,'' Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said at a
Senate Commerce Committee hearing that also heard similar criticism
from conservation groups and the U.S. tuna industry.
   Drawing the fire was the National Marine Fisheries Service,
which is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agency
charged with carrying out a congressional order to deny foreign
nations access to the U.S. tuna market if their fishing boats don't
reduce their dolphin kills.
   ``The foreign tuna fleet in the eastern tropical Pacific is
killing over 100,000 dolphins a year, and our government agencies
have done little to implement the 1984 changes designed to address
the problem,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said.
   The 1984 law was designed to put teeth into the Marine Mammal
Protection Act, enacted in 1972 to minimize the number of dolphins
killed by an international tuna industry that switched in the late
1950s from baited hooks to huge seines.
   For reasons unclear to biologists, yellowfin tuna congregate
beneath groups of surface-swimming dolphins, which serve as tuna
markers to fishing boats. Conservationists estimate that some 6
million of the mammals have drowned over the years after being
snared in tuna nets.
   Because of improved seining techniques, the number of kills by
U.S. tuna boats has dropped from 368,000 in 1972 to 13,992, the
hearing was told. Foreign kills reportedly fell from 423,678 in
1972 to an estimated maximum of 82,000 last year, compared with
108,767 in 1986 and 37,505 in 1985.
   William Fox, a member of the Marine Mammal Commission, said,
``We face a serious situation in the tropical Pacific.'' Fox said
preliminary findings from a dolphin census show some stocks are
smaller than thought and others are declining.
   It was not until recently that the fisheries service published
regulations to carry out the 1984 law. The plan would give foreign
tuna fleets until 1991 to match the performance of the U.S. fleet,
which is allowed to kill up to 20,500 dolphins a year.
   ``Why are we waiting until 1991?'' said Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif. ``I think we should pursue why it will take until 1991 to
impose these import restrictions.''
   James Douglas, NOAA's acting assistant administrator for
fisheries, said, ``We're not particularly proud of the amount of
time it took to do these regulations.''
   He said regulators were walking a tightrope, wanting to foster a
reduction in foreign fleet dolphin kills but not wanting to cause
other nations to forgo the U.S. market, sell their tuna elsewhere
and not adopt techniques to save dolphins.
   David Burney, general counsel of the U.S. Tuna Foundation, an
industry group, said foreign tuna fleets should be required to
adopt U.S. methods. ``There is no excuse for them not having done
that,'' he said. ``It should have been done three years ago.''

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Bill To Spur Pipeline Development</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Energy Committee approved
legislation Wednesday that supporters say would spur development of
slurry pipelines to transport coal from mines to markets.
   The bill, endorsed 10-6, is the latest attempt in a 10-year
effort by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., and others to get a
coal-slurry proposal though Congress.
   The legislation would give coal pipeline developers a federal
right of eminent domain, the legal authority to force landowners to
sell them property for a pipeline's right-of-way.
   Supporters of the bill say that mixing coal with water or other
substances and shipping it through a pipeline would save
transportation costs and make the fuel more competitive with
foreign coal.
   The railroad industry has opposed such proposals in the past,
saying that if it loses coal business, it would have to charge
higher shipping rates for other commodities.
   As an inducement to the railroads, the committee voted 10-8 for
an amendment that would repeal the law that prohibits railroads
from owning coal leases on federal land.

<HEAD>Marines Tighten Security In Panama After Long Gun Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Marines tightened security at a
sprawling military fuel depot on Wednesday after claiming they had
repelled 40 to 50 intruders in a two-hour firefight the night
before.
   It was the second time in two days that U.S. military officials
had reported an intrusion at the depot, and Wednesday's report
seemed sure to worsen already bitter relations between the United
States and the government controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Panamanian officials scoffed at the latest account, suggesting
it was the product of fear and imagination on the part of
inexperienced, edgy American troops.
   ``That is their version and nothing more,'' said Martin Alberto
Paz, a spokesman for the Panamanian Defense Forces, the 15,000-man
military and police unit that is the source of Noriega's power.
   ``It seems they are trying to create confusion,'' Paz added.
``It's the first time that the `gringos' don't know who's shooting
at them.''
   Col. Ron Sconyers, spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, said
there were no apparent injuries in the latest incident at the
underground petroleum storage facility at Howard Air Force Base.
   Sconyers said he could neither confirm nor deny that the
intruders were Penamanian military personnel, but said all were
``reported wearing dark uniforms.''
   Noriega is under federal indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges. For months, he has successfully resisted
efforts by the internal opposition and Washington to oust him.
   U.S. officials said the clash took place at the Arraijan Tank
Farm, an 800-acre reserve near Panama City where a Marine sentry
was shot to death Monday night while investigating what was
described as a break-in by six to eight camouflaged intruders. He
was apparently shot accidentally by another Marine, U.S. officials
said.
   Sconyers said the latest incident involved about 100 Marines. It
began, he said, when a 12-man Marine patrol ``reported receiving
fire'' at about 7:35 p.m. Tuesday (8:35 p.m. EDT) ``from a location
where they had observed an estimated 40 to 50 unauthorized
personnel.''
   ``The Marines returned the fire. Sporadic firing continued for
about two hours,'' Sconyers said.
   He said the patrol called in reinforcements, who exchanged small
arms fire with the intruders, fired three ``high explosive mortar
rounds'' at their positions and illuminated the area with flares.
Helicopters with searchlights were dispatched.
   Despite the intensity of the battle, Marines who swept the area
after daylight found no evidence of injuries and no equipment the
intruders may have left behind, Sconyers said.
   The colonel said the estimate of 40 to 50 intruders was made by
an unidentified Marine captain at the scene Tuesday, but added:
``This is a very, very thick, canopied jungle area, so it's very
difficult to make exact assessments at any point in time, even in
daylight.''
   Sconyers said the patrol first sighted the intruders at dusk,
about an hour and a half before the fight began, and later kept
them under surveillance with night detection devices.
   Asked why the intruders were not stopped when first sighted,
Sconyers said ``they were not into an area at that point that
necessitated that action, and after the firefight broke out there
were no prisoners taken.''
   Sconyers described the fuel dump as partially fenced in, and
``very heavily traversed by local residents.'' He said that U.S.
soldiers could not tell whether the intruders were armed when they
first spotted them.
   ``The only reason now that we know in fact they were armed is
because we heard gunshots and there were muzzle flashes,'' the
colonel said.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Dan Howard, suggested in Washington
Tuesday that the shooting death of a Marine guard at the fuel dump
Monday may have been provoked by Panamanian Defense Forces
personnel.
   Howard said the victim apparently was shot accidentally by
fellow Marine guards, but cited what he described as a series of
intrusions in recent weeks ``by individuals who were uniformed and
camouflaged.''
   The Panamanian government rejected the accusations.

   A timid, 450-pound black bear named
Thor has awakened from his winter slumber in the back yard of a
suburban home, unaware that he's been banished by municipal
officials to a home outside city limits.
   ``He's very gentle,'' owner Charles Crosby said. ``One time when
he was out, he saw a little poodle that was walking down the
street. Well, he just turned right around and high-tailed it back
to the house.''
   The city council originally wanted to move Thor out last fall,
but Crosby said he wasn't willing to wake him from his hibernation
for fear of raising the snoozing bruin's ire.
   ``That's something I really wouldn't want to do,'' Crosby said.
   The council delayed the move while the 6-foot animal hibernated
in his concrete den in the back yard. This spring, the council's
April 15 deadline was extended once again, giving Crosby and his
wife 30 more days to finish a new home, a log cabin outside this
Twin Cities suburb.
   Crosby said he and his wife had planned to move before the
council decided that Thor had to leave, but adds that he would have
fought the decision if they wanted to stay because they went
through all the proper channels when they got the bear.
   Crosby purchased Thor from a game farm three years ago when he
was 5 weeks old, getting up as much as four times a night to feed
him with a baby bottle. Before bringing the bear home, Crosby said,
he checked state and city laws and obtained a special license from
the Department of Natural Resources.
   But that was before the Bloomington city council passed an
ordinance that went into effect a year ago forbidding wild animals
from being kept in the city. Someone complained about Thor, and
that was that.
   ``We used to take him for walks around the neighborhood, but now
he gets about two houses away and won't go any further. He wants to
come back home,'' Crosby said.
   Still, the Crosbys are optimistic that Thor will take to his new
home. Deborah Crosby said the cabin is situated on 12 acres, and
Thor will have a large cage that has trees in it and a pond to swim
in, she said.
   Ardie Oberstar, who lives next to the Crosbys, said she'll miss
Thor. ``We love the bear. We never worried about him. He's very
gentle.''
   Crosby said he and Thor like to wrestle, but if Thor gets too
carried away, he knows how to stop him.
   ``He's real ticklish on his stomach. When I start tickling him,
he rolls over and shakes,'' Crosby said. ``His ears go back and it
looks like he's laughing.''

   The Alabama New South Coalition supports
Jesse Jackson for the Democratic presidential nomination but the
former head of the black political group says he doesn't think
Jackson will win the White House.
   ``Some time in the future, it's possible a black can win,''
Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington said Tuesday.
   ``But I do not think Jackson can win, partly because he carries
a lot of baggage among whites as a civil rights leader. This is not
to say anything negative about Jackson. This is a negative comment
on where America is.''
   In 1987, the New South Coalition, then headed by Arrington,
endorsed Jackson for the Democratic nomination.
   But Arrington, the first black mayor of Alabama's largest city,
said Jackson's recent successes are now backfiring.
   ``Now that he has become such a force, we're seeing a stop Jesse
movement,'' he said. ``I think initially it came out of the party
itself, which tossed the ball to the media, and now you'll see more
negative stories about Jackson.''

   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn says his suggestion that
Democrats put a black on their ticket for the November election has
prompted a flood of telephone calls from party leaders who disagree
with him.
   In an interview with The Boston Globe Tuesday, Flynn repeated
his earlier suggestion to columnist Mary McGrory that the Democrats
should select Jesse Jackson or another black to run for vice
president if Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is the
presidential nominee.
   Flynn said the party should do that ``even if that means we lose
the election ... I'd rather see the Democrats lose than win without
a black on the ticket.''
   ``They have put their time and hard work into the party and have
gotten very little in return,'' he said. ``Having a black on the
ticket would help reunite this country more so than any piece of
legislation.''
   Flynn declined to identify party leaders who called to disagree
with him, but said he understands ``why others believe we should
win at all costs. But I'm talking from my gut instincts.''
   Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk, in a statement from
spokeswoman Julie Anbender, said, ``Whatever combination of
candidates has the best chance of winning will be chosen. The color

<HEAD>Plane Lands On Wrong Runway, Narrowly Misses Other Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An airliner landed on the wrong runway at London's
Gatwick Airport, forcing a Boeing 737 carrying 119 people to swerve
into the mud to avoid a crash, authorities said Wednesday.
   An air traffic controller spotted the potential danger and
prevented a collision, the Civil Aviation Authority said. The 336
people aboard the two planes were unharmed, it said.
   The incident happened Tuesday about 10:20 p.m. (5:20 p.m. EDT)
when a British Island Airways BAC-111 carrying 117 people was
arriving from Venice, Italy.
   At Gatwick, about 25 miles south of London, a British Airways
Boeing 737 with 119 people was moving along a taxiway toward the
runway for takeoff to the Greek island of Rhodes.
   Instead of landing on the runway, the incoming aircraft headed
toward the adjacent taxiway. When the tower notified the jet of the
error, the landing jet threw its engines into reverse and stopped
about 750 feet short of a collision, said an aviation authority
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At the same time, the British Airways plane, which was moving
slowly, swerved off the tarmac and came to a stop in the mud and
grass beside the runway, he said.
   The aviation authority launched an inquiry and provided no
immediate explanation for the near-disastrous error. But Gatwick's
sole runway had been closed overnight for repaving, and the
adjacent taxiway was being used as a temporary runway.
   Airport managers praised the traffic controller's alertness in
preventing ``an incident becoming an accident,'' a Gatwick Airport
spokesman said. He also commended the British Airways pilot for
responding ``quickly and positively.''
   The 1,300-strong Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators said the
incident highlighted the dangers of having just one runway at
Gatwick.
   ``The worry lies in the fact that the British Airports Authority
(Gatwick's operator) are digging up the main runway at one of the
busiest times of the year,'' said the organization's clerk, Capt.
Paul Wilson.
   The incident follows a series of recent near-collisions in
Britain's skies. The aviation authority says 16 ``risk bearing''
near misses occurred in 1986, the latest figures available. They do
not include incidents on the ground.
   The airport duty manager, Ian MacCorquodale, said the airport
was not overcrowded Tuesday night.
   Gatwick, the world's busiest single-runway airport, was closed
for 20 minutes while the British Airways jet was towed away
undamaged, the aviation authority spokesman said.

<HEAD>Senior Citizens Lobby Sues Over Wage Discrepancies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior citizens lobby said Wednesday it has
sued the government to force it to credit $58.5 billion in wages to
individuals' Social Security accounts.
   The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare
said it was unsatisfied with the government's efforts to resolve
the discrepancies, which has been costing some retirees an average
of $17 a month.
   John Trollinger, a spokesman for the Social Security
Administration, said he had not seen the lawsuit and would have no
comment. But he said the administration is ``improving and making
changes in the way we gather this wage information so that the
discrepancies will be kept to an absolute minimum. ... We're
working very diligently with the IRS to resolve disrepancies from
the past.''
   Former congressman James Roosevelt, the chairman of the lobbying
group, said in a statement: ``Although the government has known
about this problem for years, its response has been wholly
inadequate.''
   The problem arose after the government switched to a dual system
for reporting employee earnings in 1978. Since then, employers have
sent one set of employee earnings reports to the IRS and another to
the Social Security Administration.
   According to the General Accounting Office, approximately $58.5
billion in wages has not been properly credited to Social Security
accounts from 1978 through 1984. Nearly 9.7 million people,
including active workers and those now retired, had some earnings
that were erroneously omitted from their records.
   The GAO said that in a sample of cases it reviewed, the typical
retiree whose wage record was not up to date had lost an average of
$16.81 a month for 31 months.
   Roosevelt said the discrepant reports were continuing to pile up
at the rate of 500,000 or more a year, and employers are only
required by law to retain employee wage records for four years.
   The Social Security Administration urges all workers to check
their wage records every three years to make sure their wages were
reported correctly. They can fill out a form and receive a printout
of past years' wages credited for Social Security, and compare that
with their own wage records.
   The group said it filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District
Court in Washington.

<HEAD>$8.8 Billion in Farm Debt Going Off the Books, FmHA Head Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government plans to write off or
defer payment on a total of $8.8 billion in debt owed by farmers to
the Farmers Home Administration, the agency's administrator said
Wednesday.
   ``It is true that we are probably writing off upwards of $8
billion to $9 billion over the next couple of years and the
agricultural credit act is responsible for a substantial portion of
that,'' FmHA Administrator Vance Clark told a Senate hearing.
   The disclosure followed unconfirmed reports last month that the
government might write off as much as $7 billion in debt under
provisions of a bailout bill for the Farm Credit System that was
passed by Congress last year.
   A farm lawmaker, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, immediately
criticized Clark for saying the Farm Credit Act was responsible for
the substantial loss to the federal government.
   Farm legislators have been sensitive to complaints that
taxpayers are footing too high a bill for subsidies to keep farmers
afloat. Grassley said he wanted to head off any such statements in
this case.
   FmHA said in specific it is ``writing down,'' or deferring
payment on $2.1 billion in debts to improve the cash flow of
farmers who cannot pay their debts at the moment. In such cases,
the government hopes eventually to recapture the amount owed.
   It said it would simply write off $6.7 billion in debt of
farmers who would not be able to achieve a black-ink cash flow even
if their debt were written down.
   Grassley noted that the Farm Credit Act allows such actions only
if they would cost the government less than foreclosing on
debt-burdened farmers.
   A substantial amount of debt piled up in the early 1980s when
many farmers found themselves overinvested in farmland amid a
nosedive in per-acre prices. Many such producers had borrowed
heavily to acquire the land and could not achieve sufficient cash
flow to make payments amid a general stagnation in the farm economy.
   ``They're including costs that would have been there even if
Congress had not passed the bill,'' Grassley said following the
hearing.
   He said that was true because the legislation ``had as a key
test whether foreclosure and restructuring would best benefit the
federal Treasury.''
   ``That's a very objective bottom line decision that really means
that what Congress passed isn't costing the federal government
anything,'' he said. Grassley also said that regulations have not
been written and thus it is not possible to say exactly how much
money is involved.

<TEXT>
   Scientists have found small residues of a
potentially cancer-causing animal drug in milk being sold in 10
U.S. cities, a Food and Drug Administration official said Wednesday.
   The drug, sulfamethazine, is approved for use in pork and beef
cattle feed but is not supposed to be used in dairy cattle feed.
   ``The levels we were finding (in milk) should not cause a public
health problem, but we are concerned because this is an illegal use
and that drug must not be used in dairy cattle,'' Gerald Guest,
head of the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine, said in a
statement.
   ``We have been meeting with the appropriate industry groups, and
they already have programs under way to communicate this concern to
their respective industries,'' Guest said. ``The message is that
sulfamethazine should not be used on dairy cattle.''
   FDA spokesman Chris Lecos said the contaminated milk samples
were taken in early March as part of an FDA program to develop a
simple and effective test that dairies can use to make sure they
are not buying contaminated milk.
   He said it was a small sampling exercise to evaluate an on-site
milk testing technique that FDA scientists believe is nearly ready
for widespread use in detecting prohibited use of the drug in dairy
cattle.
   FDA officials conducting the survey bought pasteurized whole
milk from five grocery stores in each of the 10 cities _ Boston,
Baltimore, Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Kansas City, Denver, San
Francisco, Seattle and New York.
   Of the 49 samples, 36 showed some sign of the drug, Lecos said.
Of the 36, he added, only five were above trace levels.
   ``There is no reason for the public to be concerned about the
safety of the milk,'' Lecos said. ``The point is we don't want to
find it (sulfamethazine) in milk at all.''
   The effort to develop a quick and accurate test for milk
contamination comes as the FDA is conducting a larger review of
whether sulfamethazine _ which has been used since the late 1950s
to treat respiratory disease in food animals _ should be banned
outright.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young met with manufacturers of the
drug last month to discuss the review and has convened a two-day
hearing next month to further study the issue.
   FDA studies have suggested that sulfamethazine, used in the feed
of an estimated 80 percent of all hogs marketed in the United
States, can cause cancer in mice.
   The agency decision to reopen the question of whether the drug
should be allowed at all stems from those recent studies, coupled
with improved on-site Agriculture Department pork testing methods
that suggest higher levels are reaching the market than earlier
detection methods revealed.

   The sailor accused of killing
the USS John Hancock's payroll officer and stealing $94,000
reported for duty as usual each day since the crime a month ago,
Navy investigators said.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Ruben Colon, a 14-year Navy veteran, was
in the brig Wednesday after being arrested aboard the ship the
previous day on a charge of murder and theft.
   The Navy said $94,629 in cash, plus blank U.S. Treasury checks,
were stolen from the ship's payroll office. On Tuesday,
investigators found $89,000 in cash as well as blank checks in a
bank safe deposit box rented by Colon.
   Because visits on ships such as the Hancock are tightly
restricted, authorities had suspected the killer might be among the
320 officers and sailors aboard the destroyer.
   Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad, 24, was shot and choked before his body
was shoved into a storage area of the ship in the early morning
hours of March 15, a payday for the sailors aboard the Hancock.
   Colon, 34, was confined Wednesday in the Navy brig at
Jacksonville Naval Air Station, said David L. Brant, special agent
in charge of the Naval Investigative Service office at Mayport. The
killing occurred while the ship was docked at Mayport.
   Colon of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, has been assigned to the
Hancock since 1984 and worked as a career counselor. Brant said
Colon had reported for duty regularly since the killing.
   Colon will be arraigned by the end of the week, and later a
military board similar to a civilian grand jury will convene to
determine what formal charges would be brought, Brant said. No
hearing dates have been set.
   If Colon is charged with premeditated murder and convicted in
military court, he could face the death penalty, Brant said.
   Investigators refused to disclose what led them to Colon, but
Brant said NIS and FBI agents obtained a search warrant Tuesday for
a safe deposit box rented in Colon's name at a bank in Jacksonville.
   Agents recovered $89,000 in cash, plus most or all of the
missing blank U.S. Treasury checks, and Colon was soon arrested,
Brant said.
   ``This is the most intensive investigation undertaken by this
office,'' Brant said. ``We've been working on this case for nearly
four weeks, and more than 40 agents from NIS and the FBI have been
involved.''
   Prasad, the only son of Indian-born parents, enlisted in the
Navy in April 1985 and had been stationed on the Hancock since May
1986.

<HEAD>Bill Would Provide Greater Protection Against Crimes By Foreign

<TEXT>
   Lawyers, police officers and New York City
officials on Wednesday endorsed a bill aimed at giving American
citizens greater protection against crimes committed by foreign
diplomats and dependents who are immune from arrest or prosecution.
   ``The passage of this bill will send a clear message to those
lawbreakers who know our hands have been tied by the present laws,
that they will no longer be able to wave a paper called diplomatic
immunity and walk away scot-free,'' said Dennis Ray Martin, deputy
sheriff of Saginaw County in Michigan and president of the
68,000-member American Federation of Police.
   The State Department said recently that from August 1982 through
last February, there were 147 criminal incidents in the Washington
area involving foreign diplomats, their staffs or dependents. The
violations mostly involved shoplifting but also included murder,
rape and assault.
   During the same period, 44 diplomatic crimes were reported in
the New York metropolitan area.
   Under an international agreement which was approved by the
Senate in 1965 and implemented in 1978, ambassadors and other
diplomats and their family members enjoy complete immunity from
criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits, but various exceptions are
made for lesser personnel.
   The bill, sponsored chiefly by Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y.,
would provide federal assistance to the 37 states that have funds
for compensating crime victims if they extend eligibility to
victims of diplomatic crimes.
   The measure would put Congress on record as favoring State
Department action to obtain waivers of diplomatic immunity or the
forced departure of diplomats who are charged with serious crimes.
   The State Department would be required to publish an annual list
of the names and countries of diplomats who have violated U.S.
laws, and to cooperate more closely with U.S. immigration
authorities in barring re-entry of those who have returned home.
   The department would be barred from hindering a state or local
criminal investigation or prosecution of a ``diplomatic crime''
where immunity is not involved. The bill also calls for the
president to study ways to prevent diplomatic pouches from being
used to smuggle arms or illicit narcotics into the United States.
   The State Department said recently that it generally supports
the draft legislation but objects to several provisions as
unnecessary or potentially harmful to U.S. relations with other
countries.
   At a hearing by the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
international operations, the bill won qualified endorsement from
Steven Stein, chairman of the New York City Bar Association's
committee on international law, and Gillian Sorensen, the New York
City commissioner responsible for liaison with the 35,000 foreign
diplomats, staff members and dependents in the New York area.
   Stein said the victims' compensation provision may be the most
important part of the bill. He suggested creation of a federal
compensation fund to reimburse victims of diplomatic crimes in
states where assistance is lacking.

   Commercial space launching will
develop into an important industry in the 1990s, and competition
may include the Soviet Union, a U.S. Department of Transportation
official said Wednesday.
   ``I think we will see innovation (in the commercial space
industry),'' Courtney Stadd, director of DOT's commercial
transportation office, told about 400 space industry workers at the
Fourth National Space Symposium here. ``There is some advantage to
taking private spaceports seriously.''
   DOT, as a result of the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984, has
a mandate to define and regulate commercial space efforts.
   Stadd said DOT's role is to encourage a ``competitive and
diverse'' launch industry, and to ``regulate efficiently to ensure
safe and reponsible launch activities.''
   The scope of the space industry is expanding with the start of
competition in the commercial launch field, and the Soviet Union
may become one of the bidders, Stadd said. He added that he does
not see the Soviets as an active competitor in the near future.
   Commercial space launch was born in the era in which the U.S.
government concentrated its spending on the space shuttle program.
   When the Challenger explosion and U.S. rocket failures created a
large backlog of commercial payloads, Japan, China and France began
competing for U.S. launching business.
   The concept of commercial launch competition has brought up new
issues, Stadd said. The major problem being worked out is how to
allocate launching facilities among government agencies and private
corporations.

<TEXT>
   Rare criminal misconduct charges have been filed
against two former social workers in the deaths of two abused
children whose cases they monitored.
   The charges against Hattie Roland, 37, and Diane Henton, 35,
should ``send a message to social workers that the state's
attorney's office will be reviewing their work to protect all the
children of this county,'' said Richard Daley, the Cook County
prosecutor.
   The two women, who had been fired by the Illinois Department of
Children and Family Services last year, were indicted by a county
grand jury Tuesday.
   Ms. Roland is accused of falsely claiming she visited a home and
Ms. Henton is accused of failing to report apparent abuse, said
Lisa Howard, a spokeswoman for Daley.
   The women are to enter pleas at a hearing Thursday. Daley said
Tuesday they were the first indictments of their kind to be brought
against social workers in the state.
   Howard Davidson, director of the American Bar Association Child
Advocacy Center in Washington, said Wednesday criminal charges have
been filed in rare instances but civil suits are much more common
because criminal convictions are difficult to obtain.
   DCFS Director Gordon Johnson said Wednesday that heavy
child-abuse caseloads, especially in Chicago, may make it
impossible for caseworkers to make the recommended once-a-month
visits.
   ``The question is lying about it,'' Johnson said. ``Those
individuals who don't tell the truth about providing services
should be fired.''
   ``The job just cannot be done,'' said Barry Friedman, president
of Local 2081 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees. ``You're out there, and if you make the wrong
decision, you're going to be blamed as a baby-killer.''
   Ms. Roland was indicted on 63 counts of misconduct, including
allegedly falsifying reports, Ms. Howard said.
   She is accused of reporting nine visits to the home of Debra
Hardy between February 1983 and June 1984 that she never made.
   Ms. Hardy was convicted of murder in December for the 1984
strangling of her 4-month-old son and sentenced to 20 years in
prison.
   Ms. Henton was charged with eight counts of misconduct,
including failing to report the abuse of Jonathan Campbell. The
child was killed Jan. 25, 1986 _ his first birthday _ six days
after Ms. Henton closed the case after a home visit.
   An autopsy report said the child's ears were nearly torn off and
he had 25 or more bruises on his body, many at least 10 days old.
   Anthony Habener, a friend of the child's mother, was convicted
of murder last September and sentenced to 65 years in prison.
   The two women face up to five years on each count of misconduct
if convicted.
   Both defendants, who had supervised other DCFS caseworkers, were
fired after an internal investigation accused them of misconduct in
the babies' deaths, Johnson said. Six other supervisors from the
department's Chicago office also were fired, transferred or
suspended at that time.
   Civil service officials overturned Ms. Roland's dismissal on
appeal and ordered a 120-day suspension, said Dave Schneidman, a
DCFS spokesman. That suspension has expired, but Ms. Roland has not
returned to work and the department would seek to block any attempt
by her to do so, he said.
   Ms. Henton has accepted her dismissal, Schneidman said.
   The average caseload for state workers who investigate reports
of abuse is about 45, DCFS spokeswoman Jo Warfield said Wednesday.
It is expected to rise to 48 by next year despite an increase in
the work force, she said. Forty cases would be manageable and 30
would be ``ideal,'' she added.
   In Chicago, the caseload is as high as 60 or 80, Johnson said.
   ``We can point fingers, but the problem is that we just don't
have enough money,'' he said.
   The number of child abuse and neglect reports has been exploding
in recent years because of economic frustration, better reporting
procedures and more public awareness, Warfield said. Child-abuse
reports rose to 91,723 in fiscal 1987 from 6,700 in fiscal 1976,
she said.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines was accused in a lawsuit
Wednesday of violating a labor contract by using company planes to
train non-union flight attendants to serve passengers in the event
of a possible strike.
   The suit by the union that represents Eastern flight attendants
is the latest in a series of challenges to the labor-relations
policies of Texas Air Corp., which bought financially troubled
Eastern in 1986.
   The Transport Workers Union of America, Local 553, charged that
Eastern planes are being used by Orion Lift Services Inc., an
independent cargo airline, to train non-union flight attendants.
   Last month, Eastern lost a similar suit involving the training
of non-union pilots on its aircraft by Orion.
   The Transport Workers Union charged that the training of flight
attendants violates its contract with Eastern.
   Telephone calls to Eastern headquarters in Miami went unanswered
Wednesday evening.
   Last month, U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker ordered
Eastern to stop allowing Orion to use Eastern's planes to train
non-union pilots.
   Orion, which is based in Raleigh, N.C., has a contract with
Eastern to train flight attendants and pilots to fly the passenger
carrier's aircraft in the event of a threatened strike this spring
by 13,000 members of the International Association of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers.
   The flight attendants' suit was assigned to Parker, who
determined that the pilot training ``constitutes a unilateral
repudiation of the collective bargaining agreement'' Eastern had
with the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Eastern also suffered another legal setback last month when
another federal judge in Washington held the company in contempt of
court for taking steps to sell its northeast shuttle operation to
another subsidiary of Texas Air.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt threatened to fine Eastern
$10,000 a day unless it stopped all efforts to complete the
transaction, which he said violated the terms of an injunction he
had issued last year in another labor dispute.
   The company agreed to comply with Pratt's order to purge itself
of the contempt citation and avoid the fines.

<TEXT>
   The House gave final congressional approval
Wednesday to legislation awarding the states title to abandoned
historic shipwrecks lying within their waters, after rejecting a
proposal to guarantee access to wrecks by sport divers and salvage
operators.
   By a 340-64 vote, the House passed and sent to the White House
for President Reagan's signature the same measure it narrowly
rejected two weeks ago, when opponents complained they were denied
the opportunity to offer amendments to the bill.
   The bill was brought up again Wednesday under different
parliamentary ground rules that allowed consideration of
amendments. But the major proposed change, the access guarantee
sought by Rep. Norman D. Shumway, R-Calif., in behalf of sport
divers and salvors, was defeated on a 268-134 roll call.
   Shumway's adversaries had warned that approval of any amendments
would require sending the bill back to the Senate, where they said
the measure almost certainly would die. Shumway dismissed the
warnings as ``scare tactics,'' but the measure cleared the House
without any changes.
   Before the final vote, the House rejected, 221-183, an amendment
by Rep. Robert S. Walker, R-Pa., that would have required the
states to give federal law enforcement agencies freedom to pursue
drug smugglers into state coastal waters.
   It also defeated by voice vote another Shumway proposal to limit
coverage to wrecks listed on _ or eligible for _ the National
Register of Historic Places.
   The measure wouuld give states title to the estimated 5 percent
to 10 percent of the shipwrecks in state waters that are considered
historically important. All others having no historic interest,
plus all shipwrecks lying beyond three miles offshore, would be
governed by federal admiralty law.
   Admiralty law awards shipwrecks and cargoes to the finders and
permits salvage operators to claim a major portion of the cargoes
they raise.
   Under the bill, admiralty law would not apply to the small
number of historically significant shipwrecks in state waters, and
Indian tribes would have title to shipwrecks on their lands. The
federal government would retain title to any abandoned wrecks on
public lands.
   Until now, both states and federal admiralty courts have claimed
jurisdiction over such wrecks in state waters.
   The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 gave the states ownership of all
natural resources and submerged lands up to three miles offshore
but did not cover manmade objects on those lands.
   The House had defeated the measure March 29 by a 263-139 margin,
five votes short of the two-thirds majority required for passage
under ground rules for accelerated debate with no amendments. The
rules in effect Wednesday required only a simple majority for
passage.
   The bill passed the Senate by voice vote on Dec. 19.
   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, who supported the Shumway amendment,
said he would urge the president to veto the bill unless it
guaranteed the nation's 4 million sport divers and ``latter-day
Christopher Columbuses'' the right to search state waters for
undiscovered shipwrecks.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, countered that the bill already makes
clear, in a non-binding provision, that Congress wants the states
to guarantee exploration and recovery of wrecks under federal
guidelines intended to protect historic artifacts against
plundering by profiteers.

   Minnesota is putting the swan back into
Swan Lake.
   The state Wednesday released four giant trumpeter swans at the
southern Minnesota lake to help restore the largest North American
waterfowl to the area.
   ``It was really thrilling for me,'' said DuWayne Giefer, a
director at the Nicollet Conservation Club, where the rare,
snow-white birds were released. ``They let them (the first pair) go
and they half paddled, half flew out of the lagoon to the bigger
part of the lake. Then they paddled until they got out behind some
rushes and disappeared from view.''
   The release marked the start of the second year of restoration
efforts by the state Department of Natural Resources.
   The giant birds, which weigh up to 35 pounds and have a wing
span of up to eight feet, were hunted by pioneers for their down
and meat.
   Some of the birds continue to die despite the protection of
state and federal laws and fines that can exceed $1,500, said
Carrol Henderson, the state's non-game wildlife supervisor. Some
hunters mistake the swans for ducks or geese and other birds die by
ingesting lead shot, he said.
   ``A number of people had written off trumpeter swans like the
buffalo. I took that as a challenge. I felt the birds deserved a
chance to make a comeback,'' Henderson said.
   The trumpeter swan population dwindled to fewer than 100 birds
in the continental United States 50 years ago, Henderson said. They
now number about 11,000 in North America, with most of those in
Alaska, and have started to make a comeback in the western United
States.
   No one knows how many trumpeters once lived in Minnesota, but
the Sioux Indians called Swan Lake ``Manha tanka otamenda,'' or
``Lake of the Many Large Birds,'' Henderson said.
   Now, the state has about 125 of the swans, said Donna Compton of
the Trumpeter Swan Society.
   Compton works on a 22-year-old restoration project of Hennepin
County Parks in the Minneapolis area that has placed about 50 birds
around the state, but she admits that success isn't guaranteed.
   ``It's a gamble at this point,'' said Compton.
   The state is raising birds at a cost of $1,600 each from eggs
collected from the western United States, Canada and Alaska and
plans to release them as they turn 3 years old.
   It released its first crop last year in northwestern Minnesota.
Thirteen birds survived and migrated to Iowa and central Minnesota,
and they are expected to return this month and mate.
   Up to 16 more pairs will be released next Wednesday near Detroit
Lakes in the northwestern part of the state as part of plans to
place 40 trumpeters a year through 1990, Henderson said.
   The project is the biggest beneficiary of the state's non-game
wildlife fund, which residents can contribute to through their
income and property taxes. The state has spent $140,000 so far, he
said.
   No federal funds can be used because the bird is not on the
endangered species list.
   ``Actually it was more rare than the bald eagle, and yet because
of this little bureaucratic technicality, there was no way we could
get (federal) funding to start the program,'' Henderson said.

<HEAD>Soviets Sent Trucks, Possibly Troops, into Afghanistan, Sources
Say</HEAD>

   The Soviets, on the verge of signing an
agreement calling for their withdrawal from Afghanistan, sent large
numbers of trucks across the border this week and some
administration sources said they contained up to 15,000 fresh
combat soldiers.
   At the same time, Soviet armored units already in Afghanistan
moved south from Kabul to relieve the beleaguered city of Gardez,
according to intelligence sources.
   Analysts who montor the fighting disagreed over whether the
trucks which moved across the border contained troops. One source,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said they apparently were empty
and intended for use in a Soviet withdrawal.
   Another source said the trucks were believed to contain elite
combat units to replace engineering and other support troops that
are thought likely to be among the first to be pulled out.
   The activity was reported the day before the Soviets were
expected to sign as guarantors of a United Nations agreement on the
withdrawal of the Red Army from Afghanistan.
   The Soviet units headed for Gardez, 80 miles south of Kabul and
60 miles from the Pakistani border, consisted of an undeterined
number of soldiers and 420 vehicles, including T-72 tanks, armored
personnel carriers and mobile rocket launchers, said one
administration source.
   Mujahedeen guerrillas recently cut the road to Gardez, where a
Soviet special forces, or spetsnaz, regiment is garrisoned, said
the source.
   Some analysts said they believe the Soviets will withdraw the
spetsnaz unit to Kabul as they begin to withdraw the Red Army from
Afghnistan.
   The advancing column and the spetsnaz regiment are also expected
to attack stockpiles of guerilla armaments.
   U.S. intelligence analysts were divided as to why the Soviets
sent the 15,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan. Some suggested
they were sending in more elite combat units to replace engineers
in their occupation force, estimated to total 120,000.
   Other analysts, in the administration and on Capitol Hill, fear
the Soviets will heavily fortify the area around the capital city
of Kabul and the northern provinces, adjacent to the Soviet Union,
where Afghanistan's rich natural gas fields are located.
   Under the withdrawal agreement, the Soviets are supposed to pull
out 50 percent of their troops within 90 days, and U.S. analysts
believe the Red Army will pull back from exposed positions and
concentrate in Kabul and around the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.
   Most U.S. analysts believe that the Kremlin-backed regime headed
by Najib will collapse during or after the Soviet withdrawal, the
intelligence sources said. The withdrawal is supposed to be
completed by Feb. 15, 1989, but the United States wants it finished
earlier, they said.
   But the collapse of the Kremlin-backed government ``may not be
as imminent as we thought before,'' said one source. The Afghan
guerrillas are thought to be divided and may not be strong enough
to take Kabul by storm.
   The Najib regime is backed by an estimate 40,000 regular army
troops, 30,000 agents and uniformed military units in WAD, the
security police agency, plus about 40,000 men in tribal militias.
   The explosion this week at an ammunition depot in Islamabad,
Pakistan, destroyed a large number of U.S. weapons intended for the
guerrillas. Pakistani and American officials say they are
investigating the possibility that the blast was detonated by
communist agents.
   By late Wednesday, U.S. intelligence had not received concrete
evidence that the blast was anything but accidental, according to
government sources.
   ``There is no evidence in the intelligence community that it was
sabotage. It is plausible, but we don't have any evidence,'' said
one source.
   WAD, created and run by the Soviet KGB, has detonated hundreds
of explosions in Pakistan over the last two years.
   The intent of the explosions has been to pressure Pakistan to
stop allowing the use of its soil for the training and arming of
the guerrillas, according to U.S. and Pakistani officials.
   The United Nations-brokered agreement on withdrawing the Soviet
troops also calls for ``non-interference and non-intervention'' by
foreign powers in Afghan affairs.
   The Soviets are expected to use that language to pressure
Pakistan, despite a separate deal reportedly worked out between the
United States and the Soviet Union under which both will continue
to supply the warring Afghan parties.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci reiterated Wednesday that
the covert aid to the guerrillas will continue.
   ``We have negotiated what we call positive symmetry with the
Soviets,'' Carlucci said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''
program. ``That is to say if they continue their aid to the puppet
government, we will continue our aid to the freedom fighters.''
   Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Tex., one of the most ardent
congressional supporters of the Afghan guerrillas, said after a
meeting with Secretary of State George P. Shultz Wednesday that he
was convinced that the Soviets would withdraw.
   ``The Russians have accepted the most microscopic fig leaf in
history,'' said Wilson, referring to the ``non-interference and
non-intervention'' clause in the accords. And he predicted that
Pakistan would continue aiding the guerrillas.

<TEXT>
   Edwin Meese III, the U.S. attorney
general, said Wednesday a combination of reduced drug consumption
and sustained action against traffickers can win the battle against
narcotics.
   He commented at a news conference in La Paz, his last stop on a
Latin American tour that also included the Dominican Republic,
Colomoia, Ecuador and Peru.
   During a three-day visit to Bolivia ending Wednesday, Meese and
John Lawn, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration,
visited the Chapare cocaine-producing region in the tropical
lowlands.
   The attorney general personally set fire to two tons of cocaine
paste captured by Bolivian drug police trained by the U.S.
military, DEA and Border Patrol.
   In La Paz, Meese conferred with the National Council for the
Fight Against Drugs, Vice President Julio Garrett and President
Victor Paz Estenssoro.
   ``We are embarked on a long-term struggle against drugs, and in
that context we are making recognizable progress, but whether we
are ultimately successful will depend on sustaining our effort and
reducing the consumption of drugs,'' Meese said.
   ``We are impressed by the commitment of the Bolivian government,
the quality of the anti-drug police and the government's efforts to
reduce coca leaf cultivation, interdict chemicals and arrest
traffickers.''
   He described Bolivia's anti-drug campaign as the most successful
in South America. The DEA says Bolivia produces one-third of the
cocaine that reaches illegal U.S. and European markets.
   Bolivia, an impoverished country of 6.4 million, has made an
agreement with farmers in the Chapare to reduce coca leaf
cultivation. Anibal Aguilar, undersecretary for alternative crop
development, says the farmers have destroyed 4,000 acres of coca
plants in six months.
   In return, they have received cash payments and aid to switch to
other crops such as coffee and citrus fruits.
   Police have confiscated 4.6 tons of cocaine paste since January,
with a wholesale value in the United States of $46 million, the DEA
says.
   Paz Estenssoro's government says it needs at least $300 million
a year for an effective anti-cocaine program. Washington provides
$33 million.

<HEAD>Senate Considers More Money For War On Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday kicked aside two days
of arguments about truth-in-budgeting and began expanding the war
on drugs as it moved to finish its $1.1 trillion fiscal 1989
spending plan.
   Leaders said they would complete action on the fiscal blueprint
by Thursday.
   The Senate approved 76-18 on Wednesday night an amendment
cutting government travel accounts by $125 million to finance new
federal prisons and drug law enforcement efforts.
   A second, $1.4 billion expansion of drug programs was being
prepared for the election-year plan.
   Lawmakers had been ensnarled since Monday in a debate over
whether surpluses in the Social Security system and other federal
trust funds masked the extent of the deficit problem.
   The budget claims a deficit of $136 billion in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. But it would be about $220 billion if trust fund
earnings weren't counted.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., proposed
that the Senate go on record opposed to counting against the
deficit the Social Security surpluses being built up now to be
spent for future retirees.
   Other senators then loaded on amendments covering trust funds
for aviation, road-building, the Postal Service, military
retirement, and the banking system.
   After the accounting issue threatened to put the Senate into a
stall, Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., won a substitute amendment.
It referred the issue to the new National Economic Commission,
which will be examining deficit issues over the next year.
   The way was then cleared for other amendments, including an
expected proposal to increase spending on drug treatment and law
enforcement by $1.4 billion next year.
   The amendment, being drafted by Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., would breach the limits of last fall's
deficit reduction agreement between President Reagan and
congressional leaders.
   However, the money could be allocated under a clause providing
for dire emergencies certified by the president and congressional
leaders. The sponsors said the increased cost could be covered by
increasing collection of debts owed the government and tax law
enforcement.
   Last fall's budget agreement set overall spending levels for the
military, foreign aid, and domestic agencies.
   In meeting those caps, outside of the new drug spending, the
Senate plan cut spending on some subsidies and for development and
transportation. However, it also included big increases in spending
in selected areas. Those include:
   _A 27 percent increase in the space program, 11 percent more for
National Science Foundation research aid, and money to start work
on the proposed superconducting super collider nuclear physics
project.
   _A 19 percent boost for aviation safety, including hiring more
air traffic controllers and modernizing equipment.
   _An increase of 7.4 percent for education programs.
   The Pentagon, under the budget agreement, would spend $294
billion, and $16.1 billion would be spent on foreign aid.
   There were no tax increases included, beyond the $14 billion
enacted last december under the agreement.
   The Senate and House must agree on a single budget resolution
before it becomes final. The budget, which does not require the
president's signature, becomes Congress' internal guideline for its
fiscal legislation.
   Although this year's budget resolutions are similar because of
the deficit agreement, the House and Senate disagree on some
priorities.
   The House plan would provide more money for development programs
and less for the space program. The House also voted for a 3
percent pay raise for all federal employees, while the Senate
adopted Reagan's proposal to give the military 4.3 percent and
civilian workers 2 percent.

   Troops killed three Arab guerrillas trying to
enter Israel from Lebanon on Wednesday and a 70-year-old
Palestinian woman died after soldiers tossed tear gas into her
home, according to army and other reports.
   The army denied Arab accounts that the woman suffocated from the
gas and said she died of natural causes.
   Two Palestinians were reported wounded by gunfire and 51 injured
by rubber bullets, tear gas and beatings in a battle between
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip.
   At least 144 Palestinians have died in the rebellion that began
Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N.
figures. An Israeli soldier and a 15-year-old Jewish settler also
have been killed.
   Arabs attacked Arab merchants who defied Palestine Liberation
Organization orders to close, firebombing the shop of a Jerusalem
moneychanger and setting stalls ablaze in the Bethlehem produce
market, police and witnesses reported. An Arab passerby was
reported injured by the firebomb.
   Soldiers clashed for a second day in Gaza with Arabs protesting
the deportation of eight Palestinians to Lebanon on Monday.
   Five were from the 28-mile-long coastal strip captured from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel accused the deportees of
inciting much of the four months of violence Palestinians call
``the uprising.''
   Soldiers also raided the West Bank village of Salfit, 21 miles
north of Jerusalem. The army said several dozen Arabs were arrested
in the village which has declared itself ``liberated'' from Israeli
occupation. Israeli media said 70 were arrested.
   At the United Nations, the PLO asked for a Security Council
meeting on the deportations. It was tentatively set for Thursday.
   The first letter from an Israeli Jew known to have been
published by an Arab nationalist newspaper urged Arabs to end the
violence. The author, 13-year-old Lior Kay of Tel Aviv, said he
wanted to start a dialogue with Palestinian children.
   Soldiers on patrol in south Lebanon, where Israel maintains a
``security zone'' just north of the frontier, surprised three
guerrillas before dawn in bushes about 100 yards from the border
fence near the Kfar Yuval collective farm, the army said.
   ``We surrounded the terrorists from all sides,'' the Israeli
news agency Itim quoted one soldier as saying. ``They tried to flee
and we fired on them. They were killed on the spot.''
   An army statement said the Arabs were on a hostage-taking
mission, armed with M-16 rifles, hand grenades and four rockets. It
was the second attempt to infiltrate that area in nine days and the
10th cross-border guerrilla operation since November.
   Israeli officials have linked guerrilla raids to the rebellion
among the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied territories,
which Israel has governed since seizing them from Jordan and Egypt
21 years ago.
   ``What is happening today with the riots in the territories
propels guerrilla organizations to try to show more participation
in the events,'' said the army's northern commander, Maj. Gen.
Yossi Peled.
   In Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, soldiers fired on protesters
outside a school, hitting two teen-agers in the legs, U.N. workers
and hospital officials said.
   Officials at the U.N. clinic and Dr. Ahmed Yassih of Shifa
Hospital, where some were treated, said 51 other people in the camp
were injured by rubber bullets, tear gas and beatings.
   Army spokesmen confirmed the violence at Jabaliya and said the
casualty reports were being checked. They said the army closed the
Jabaliya, Nusseirat and Khan Yunis camps to outsiders and ordered
residents of the Shati camp to stay indoors.
   Soldiers hurled a tear gas canister into the home of Wadfah
Farraj Allah, 70, and she was dead on arrival at the U.N. clinic in
Jabaliya, said Christine Debaigh, spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency, which cares for Palestinian refugees.
   Shifa Hospital officials said Mrs. Allah suffocated after
inhaling the gas. Warnings on canisters say the contents can be
lethal if inhaled in a small, enclosed space.
   An army spokesman rejected the account, saying that ``results of
an autopsy carried out by the (government-run) Pathological
Institute in Abu Kabir showed the woman died of natural causes.''
   He said the institute also determined that a 21-year-old Arab
man from Khan Yunis who was reported dead Tuesday perished of
natural causes. Arab sources had said he died as a result of tear
gas inhalation.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday a ``window of
hope'' has been opened by the agreement on Soviet military
withdrawal from Afghanistan and other improvements in international
relations.
   The Soviet leader said the superpowers could reach agreement
rapidly on a 50-percent cut in strategic weapons, presumably
meaning before his fourth summit with President Reagan begins May
29 in Moscow.
   ``We are convinced that this goal is attainable in the immediate
future if both sides are guided by the fundamental approach agreed
upon at the meetings of the U.S. and Soviet leaders rather than by
momentary considerations and political opportunism,'' he said.
   Gorbachev played host at the Kremlin on Wednesday night to
visiting American business leaders attending the 10th annual
meeting of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council. His
remarks were reported by the official Tass news agency.
   Gorbachev told his American guests, including Commerce Secretary
C. William Verity, that his ambitious program of economic and
social reform gives the two countries an opportunity to develop a
``new system'' of trade ties between the superpowers.
   The United States and Soviet Union ``can become mutually
supplementary components of the world economy in the 21st
century,'' he said, offering a review of his leadership's plans for
accelerating Soviet economic progress.
   He contended, however, that some Americans still want to use
economic relations as a lever to interfere in Soviet domestic
affairs.
   ``There are and will be serious differences between our
countries,'' Gorbachev said. ``But the times demand that these
differences not be a source of enmity and begin being used, insofar
as this is possible, as a stimulus to mutually advantageous
competition.''
   On international relations, ``We believe that the situation has
changed for the better, that a window of hope has opened a
little,'' he declared. ``The possibilities of finding solutions to
complicated issues engendered in the years of the Cold War have
become more apparent.''
   He said the agreement on Afghanistan to be signed Thursday in
Geneva may have international implications on a par with the
superpower treaty signed in December to ban medium-range nuclear
missiles.
   The Geneva agreement commits the Kremlin to withdrawing its
estimated 115,000 troops from Afghanistan. Soviet soldiers entered
Afghanistan in December 1979, presided over the replacement of one
pro-Moscow leader by another and stayed to help fight Moslem
guerrillas.
   ``By participating _ as mediators and official guarantors _ in
settling the Afghanistan problem, the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. create
a precedent of constructive interaction, which is needed so badly
to improve international relations in general,'' Gorbachev said.
   He said he hoped the Afghan settlement will ``lend an impulse''
to bring about settlements for other regional conflicts.
   Gorbachev said his program for domestic reform, known as
``perestroika,'' or restructuring, spawned disagreement in Soviet
society because some people are unwilling to change or give up
comfortable and convenient practices.
   ``Naturally, an acute confrontation, I would even say, a clash
of views, has begun,'' he said.
   The Soviet leader seemed at pains to assure his American guests,
many of whom do business with the Soviet Union or may enter joint
ventures with Soviet companies, that the confrontation has limits
and that his reforms will not include introducing capitalist
practices.
   ``There is struggle, but it takes place on a socialist
platform,'' Gorbachev said. ``I would like to warn against
delusions on this account on the part of those who watch this
struggle from the sidelines.''

   The rusting Williamsburg Bridge will be closed
for inspection and causing headaches for thousands of commuters for
at least three weeks, but the city probably won't be forced to
close it for good, officials said Wednesday.
   ``I'm very, very concerned with what I have found. It's much
worse than expected in key locations,'' Foster J. Beach III,
regional director of the state Department of Transportation, said
Wednesday. ``But I think we caught things early enough to repair
it.''
   The 85-year-old bridge is one of three that cross the East River
between Brooklyn and Manhattan, and is used by an estimated 100,000
cars and more than 400 subway trains a day.
   The bridge was abruptly closed to all vehicles Tuesday evening
after investigators found 30 of the hundreds of steel girders
inspected thus far were rusted out, said Transportation
Commissioner Ross Sandler.
   Earlier in the week, inspectors had already ordered the closing
of the subway lines across the crumbling bridge, and half of the
car lanes were also out of service. The shutdown of the remaining
car lanes made Wednesday's rush hours a nightmare, with long
backups on alternate routes.
   At the bridge, which was vacant except for an occasional
pedestrian, bicyclist or reporter, more than 60 inspectors scoured
the span. About 45 percent of the inspection _ the first full
examination since 1984 _ had been completed, officials said.
   Depending on the results of the search and the corresponding
repair of any faults, the bridge could be open in three weeks, said
Deputy Commissioner Samuel Schwartz. But the discovery of
additional major flaws or repair problems could extend that to a
month or more, he warned.
   Both Schwartz and Beach indicated that initial fears that the
bridge would never reopen would probably not be realized. But
officials stressed that the problems at the bridge were severe.
   ``We've found 30 faults already, and we could find twice as many
today,'' said Transportation Department spokesman Victor Ross.
``These are sections literally holding on by the paint.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, after examining the bridge himself,
promised the city would not agree to a quick reopening to ease
congestion while a long-term solution to the bridge problem is
sought.
   ``It is better to be inconvenienced and safe than convenient and
dead,'' Koch said. ``We're going to be very conservative about
opening this bridge.''
   The city is due to decide this summer whether to repair the
bridge at a cost Beach estimated at $250 million, or to pay $200
million to $800 million to replace it.
   As for who is to blame for the rapidly deteriorating bridge,
officials pointed back to neglect by previous administrations.
   ``The city of New York had no capital budget prior to when I
came in. This bridge has been falling apart since World War II,''
said Koch.
   ``All of this was preventable by painting ...,'' Schwartz
agreed. ``(But) after World War II, the focus was on building new
things. There was no ribbon-cutting for the painting of the
Williamsburg Bridge.''
   ``If we'd taken care of it, we wouldn't be talking about the
funeral of the bridge,'' he said. ``We'd be talking about its
centennial.''

   Top finance officials of the world's seven
major industrial powers, putting on a show of unity to reassure
financial markets, agreed Wednesday to continue efforts to
stabilize the value of the dollar.
   The group, consisting of finance ministers and central bank
leaders from the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Canada and Italy, issued a statement announcing the
extension of a Dec. 22 agreement that has so far successfully
halted the greenback's three-year decline.
   The two-page joint communique followed a full day of private
meetings hosted by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   The statement also announced the adoption of an innovative
suggestion made by Baker last September to use gold and other
commodities as a way of measuring inflation pressures.
   In addition, the finance ministers were critical of the newly
industrialized nations of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong
Kong for not doing enough to reduce global trade imbalances.
   The meeting was the first face-to-face encounter the top finance
leaders have had since the global crash of stock markets last
October, a selloff triggered partly by squabbling among the top
economic powers.
   Mindful of investors' continued uneasiness at any signs of
disunity, the finance leaders went out of their way in their joint
statement to emphasize their strong desire to cooperate with each
other in keeping the global economy from toppling into a recession.
   The statement reaffirmed a Dec. 22 agreement that had been
issued after long-distance discussions in which the seven countries
pledged to work together to keep the dollar from falling further
against major currencies.
   The statement said the nations ``expressed their determination
to continue to coordinate economic policies to strengthen
underlying fundamentals.''
   ``The general feeling is that the economies of the various
countries are performing well,'' Canadian Finance Minister Michael
Wilson said at the conclusion of the session.
   The upbeat tone, in the view of most analysts, is justified.
Growth is higher this year than had been expected and the threat of
a global recession caused by the market crash has receded.
   While the United States is still running a large trade deficit,
the imbalance has been slowly improving in recent months.
   The seven nations adopted an American proposal to urge Taiwan,
South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong to ``accept greater
responsibility'' in correcting large trade imbalances by making
further efforts to reduce trade barriers and to allow their
currencies to appreciate more.
   All four countries had large trade surpluses with the United
States last year, accounting for almost one-fourth of this nation's
record $171 billion trade deficit.
   The statement also said the seven nations had agreed to develop
a commodity price index as an additional economic barometer the
countries will use to help them to coordinate policy goals.
   The statement set no deadline for when the index would first be
used. There were also not details provided of what commodities
would be included.
   At the group's last meeting in September, Baker had caught other
finance ministers by surprise when he first suggested the use of
gold and other commodities as a signal of the presence or absence
of inflationary pressures.
   Baker has stressed that the proposal is not a first step back
toward a gold standard, the system by which currencies were
stabilized for a quarter-century following World War II.
   French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, briefing reporters
after the meeting, said that the commodities to be included in the
index were still to be decided. While no timetable was set for
completion of the study, Balladur said he expected Baker's proposal
would be reviewed again in mid-June at the economic summit in
Toronto.
   The joint statement was generally in line with what economists
and financial investors had been expecting.
   ``I think they realize that if anything would be
counterproductive at the current time it would be renewed
squabbling,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources
Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   The dollar has risen in recent days on currency markets in
anticipation of the unity statement. Analysts cautioned, however,
that those gains could be quickly lost if a report to be issued
Thursday shows that the U.S. trade deficit for February was
unexpectedly large.
   The administration and its allies launched in effort in
September 1985 to push the dollar lower as a way of reducing
America's trade deficits and heading off protectionist moves in
Congress.
   The administration publicly renounced further efforts to weaken
the dollar in February 1987 in an agreement with its allies known
as the Louvre accord. In that agreement, the major economies
pledged to work to support the dollar's value at then-current
levels.
   Despite that pact, the dollar continued falling for much of
1987, pushed down by financial markets which feared that steadily
worsening monthly trade figures would force the administration to
work for a weaker dollar, despite public assurances to the contrary.
   The falling dollar raised fears in the United States about
renewed inflation and prompted the Federal Reserve last September
to hike interest rates.
   After the Oct. 19 stock market plunge raised fears of a possible
global recession, the economic powers issued the Dec. 22 pledge
reaffirming their commitment to stabilize the dollar. They backed
up that pledge with massive intervention in currency markets, the
process by which countries buy a weak currency such as the dollar
to prop up its value.
   The meetings of the seven top industrial countries were taking
place during sessions of the 151-nation Internatinal Monetary Fund
and World Bank.

   Larry Speakes' disclosure that he concocted
quotes for President Reagan while White House spokesman drew
criticism from public relations executives Wednesday, with most
calling it deceptive and damaging.
   However, none was willing to say Speakes should quit his
position as head of communications at the Wall Street investment
giant Merrill Lynch & Co. A few said they expected the entire
episode to fade quickly from public interest.
   Some sources, speaking on condition they not be identified,
suggested it was possible Speakes could face sanctions by the
Public Relations Society of America for violation of its code of
ethics.
   Article 7 of the code states: ``A member shall not intentionally
communicate false or misleading information and is obligated to use
care to avoid communication of false or misleading information.''
   But Speakes did not become a society member until November, well
after his departure from the White House, and the society's
national secretary, Isobel Parke, said the group's attorneys
believed ``the code covers the actions of members while they are
members.''
   ``It is written in the present tense. It does not refer to
actions that members may or may not have done before they joined,''
she said.
   Ethics-code violators face penalties from warnings to expulsion
from the 13,000-member society.
   Ms. Parke would not comment specifically on Speakes'
disclosures, made in a book about his White House tenure. She also
wouldn't speculate on whether his credibility had been damaged, but
said ``if any individual deliberately fabricates quotations it will
indeed damage his trustworthiness, particularly with the press.''
   Merrill Lynch spokesman William Clark said there was no change
in Speakes' status at the company, and Clark rejected a suggestion
that Merrill Lynch's own credibility may have been hurt.
   ``The events portrayed in the book had nothing to do with
Merrill Lynch,'' Clark said.
   Speakes said Tuesday that he had told Reagan about the quotes
and the president never objected. But Reagan said Wednesday he was
not aware until recent days that Speakes had attributed statements
to him he didn't make.
   ``In the 34 years I've represented controversial and prominent
people, I've never taken it upon myself to make up a quote,'' said
Howard J. Rubenstein, who heads a large PR firm in New York. ``I
think that goes well beyond reason and creates a false impression
that public relations people are manipulative and can't be
trusted.''
   Rubenstein, whose clients have ranged from corporate takeover
strategists to media magnate Rupert Murdoch, seemed to reflect the
majority view in the industry in saying that credibility is crucial
and that Speakes' behavior ``was quite damaging to all public
relations people.''
   Nevertheless, Rubenstein said he did not believe Merrill Lynch's
credibility was threatened by the disclosures.
   ``I just think it's unfortunate. I'm glad he disclosed it,
though; I think it's an important catharsis,'' Rubenstein said.
``If he said nothing, no one would ever know about it. That would
be unfortunate because he would be living with a lie.''
   Speakes was criticized by many other public relations
executives, from the biggest international firms to the small
one-office operations.
   ``The bottom line is credibility,'' said Anthony R. Katz, senior
vice president of D-A-Y Ogilvy & Mather, one of the world's largest
public relations concerns. ``The role of the PR person is to
communicate, to advance a person's point of view responsibly. ...
The president's cause was not advanced.''
   Vivian Manuel, president of VM Communications Inc., a small New
York-based public relations agency, said: ``I think when you say
somebody said something, they should have said it.''
   Nevertheless, a few said they could understand how Speakes may
have likened the concocted quotes to the job of a speechwriter who
is sensitive to a client's time pressure and intimately familiar
with how a client thinks.
   ``If he was making up quotes that in effect made up public
policy, I'd be a lot more concerned,'' said Ernest J. DiRico, chief
operating officer of Fleishman and DiRico Public Relations in
Atlanta.
   ``But I think in a lot of cases, whether it's a business
executive or public official, they employ a PR person to act as
official spokesperson,'' he said. ``They assume the PR person would
have the good sense to know where the boundaries are. If you step
over the boundaries, you get fired.''

<TEXT>
   Algerian officials said Wednesday that
Kuwait's ``intransigence'' had created a deadlock in negotiations
with Shiite Moslem hijackers for the release of 32 hostages on a
Kuwaiti jumbo jet.
   Food and water were taken in the afternoon to the blue-and-white
Boeing 747, which the hijackers call the ``plane of martyrdom.'' It
baked under the North African sun on an isolated patch of tarmac at
Houari Boumedienne airport.
   A delegation from Kuwait arrived Wednesday afternoon to help in
efforts to free the remaining hostages and the plane, which was
hijacked April 5 on a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait with 112 people
aboard.
   It spent three days on the ground in Mashhad, Iran, flew to
Cyprus on Friday and arrived here early Wednesday.
   The six to eight gunmen, who have killed two passengers, demand
that Kuwait free 17 pro-Iranian extremists convicted in the 1983
bombings of the U.S. and French embassies there. The hostages
included three members of the Kuwaiti royal family.
   Sheik Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah, Kuwait's defense Minister,
affirmed Wednesday his country's ``unwavering and principled stance
of rejecting blackmail,'' the Persian Gulf sheikdom's official news
agency KUNA reported. ``We would not change our attitude.''
   A ranking Algerian official told The Associated Press privately:
``If they merely wanted to restate their known position, there was
no need for them to send their high-level delegation to Algiers.''
He said ``the intransigence'' of Kuwait had stalled negotiations.
   His remarks appeared to confirm unofficial reports that Algeria
was pressing Kuwait for more flexibility.
   Talks between Algerian mediators and the Kuwaiti delegation
continued late Wednesday. Two Algerians entered the plane briefly
Wednesday evening.
   Algiers radio, quoting its correspondent at the airport,
reported movement in negotiations between two Algerian officials
and the hijackers, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.,
monitored in London.
   ``As a result, concrete progress has been made and this might
lead to a peaceful end to the hijack in the next few hours,'' said
the correspondent for the state-owned radio.
   However, the official Algerian news agency APS later reported
``little likelihood of an end to the affair tonight.''
   The news agency said the hijacked plane would be moved to the
end of the runway to permit a plane carrying Zambian President
Kenneth Kaunda to land. Kaunda had been due on a state visit.
   The jet left Larnaca, Cyprus, early Wednesday after 12 more
hostages were released. They arrived Wednesday night in Kuwait and
were met by the interior minister, Sheik Salem Sabah al-Sabah.
   On the same Boeing 727 to Kuwait were the bodies of the two
slain passengers, their coffins drapped in the red, black, green
and white Kuwaiti flag.
   Fifty-seven other hostages were freed at Mashhad, a city in
northeastern Iran. Passengers released Tuesday said one gunman
boarded the plane at Massad and the hijackers got a new supply of
weapons there.
   Mohammed Saud al-Osaimi, a Kuwaiti deputy foreign minister, led
the nine-member delegation to Algiers.
   He told reporters ``I hope this will be the last stage of the
voyage,'' but the Kuwait daily Al Watan quoted Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, as saying: ``I
don't think this operation will come to an end in Algiers.''
   The PLO has been involved in negotiations with the hijackers.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman
said: ``We had repeatedly indicated that we believed the plane
should be kept on Cyprus and we regret the decision to allow it to
leave.''
   A truck drove to the plane Wednesday and the hijackers lowered a
rope made of knotted tablecloths to lift cases of food and water
through the doorway.
   At about the same time, one gunman leaned through the pilot's
window and lowered a white sheet to cover part of the Kuwait flag
emblazoned on the aircraft.
   Before the Kuwaitis arrived, Interior Minister Hedi Khediri
visited the plane twice and told reporters he was assured the
gunmen would ``use no violence'' on Algerian territory.
   Khediri said he saw five or six hijackers, but did not know the
exact number, and was told there were 32 hostages.
   Adnan Rashi Majiki, a Kuwaiti in his 60s who was one of the 12
freed in Larnaca, told the AP the hijackers ``were six but I think
in Mashhad they became seven.'' A Kuwait newspaper said Wednesday
one gunman was believed to have boarded the plane in Mashhad.
   Another passenger, Ramadan Ali, told U.S. television: ``They
changed the crew, you know, their team. One of them left ... and
another two guys came over ... and they provided them with new
weapons ... and bombs ... and ropes ... and explosives.''
   In an interview with Cable Network News, Arafat blamed Iran for
the hijacking. When asked who was involved, he said: ``Some of them
are Lebanese. Some of them belong to the Iranian government.
   ``According to my best information, they (the Iranians) are
behind the whole operation,'' Arafat said by telephone from North
Yemen.
   Iran accuses Kuwait of aiding Iraq, with which the Iranians have
been at war since September 1980, and has attacked its main
oil-loading docks with missiles.

   Iraq said Wednesday its troops repulsed
an Iranian offensive in Kurdistan province, and missile batteries
fired three long-range rockets into Tehran. Iran said it fired two
missiles into Baghdad.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi troops launched a
series of counterattacks Tuesday night, seeking to recapture
territory they lost in the northeastern Iraqi province.
   It said 3,500 Iraqis have been killed or wounded since the
offensive was launched Monday across the mountainous border, south
of the town of Penjwin.
   The Iraqi News Agency said two long-range missiles were fired
into Tehran around noon. A third was fired about two hours later.
   The Iranian agency said four civilians were killed and several
wounded in the first barrage.
   It said two missiles were fired into Baghdad several hours
later. Iraq did not immediately confirm the reported strikes.
   Iraq says it has fired 123 missiles into the Iranian capital
since the latest round of the so-called ``war of the cities''
flared Feb. 29. Iran has retaliated with 57 into Baghdad.
   Tehran radio said Iran also fired two short-range missiles at
the town of Al-Amarah in southern Iraq in retaliation for the
latest Iraqi attacks.
   It said Iranian jet fighters bombed Iraqi troop concentrations
in the northern province of Sulaymaniyah.
   Reporting on the land offensive, the Iraqi agency said the
Iranians ``could not seize a single inch of Iraqi territory.''
   ``The situation settled in favor of the Iraqi forces at 6:35
p.m. (10:35 a.m. EDT Tuesday) after 60 hours of unabated
fighting,'' it said, adding that the Iraqi troops killed or wounded
``thousands'' of Iranians, ``wiping out four entire brigades.''
   The Iranian agency claimed Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical
bombs as the defenders lost ground in their push into the strategic
region east of Iraq's important Kirkuk oilfields.
   It said Iranian troops were equiped with gas masks and
protective clothing, ``but many were injured.'' It did not
elaborate.
   It said the Iranians captured 25 square miles of Iraqi
territory, including ``strategic heights'' and several villages.
   The agency said Iranian jets twice bombed a headquarters of the
Iraqi army's 1st Corps at Kani Mizan, west of Penjwin, on Tuesday
``inflicting heavy damage.''
   Penjwin is 25 miles north of an Iranian bridgehead around Lake
Darbandikhan, seized in an offensive last month.
   The Iraqi agency said helicopter gunships flew 136 combat
missions on Tuesday, indicating a sizeable engagement.
   There was no independent confirmation of either side's claims.
Iran and Iraq rarely allow correspondents into the battle zones of
the 7{-year-old war.
   Baghdad has admitted losing territory around Lake Darbandikhan,
where the Iranians say they are threatening a hydroelectric dam
that supplies much of the power for the region and Baghdad.
   The new thrust appeared designed to intensify the pressure on
Iraqi troops in the region, who are already bogged down fighting
Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas.
   In the Persian Gulf, two more convoys of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti
tankers sailed without incident Tuesday.
   The USS Jack Williams escorted the 81,283-ton oil products
carrier Surf City and the U.S. Navy tanker Gus W. Darnell from
Kuwait. Headed for Kuwait were the 46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier
Gas King and the frigate Samuel B. Roberts.
   The United States last July agreed to reflag 11 oil tankers to
protect them against attack by Iran, which accuses Kuwait of aiding
Iraq.

<HEAD>Third World Governments Ask Debt Relief</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Finance Ministers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of 24 Third World countries
asked banks and governments of developed nations Wednesday to
relieve them of some of their debt burden, due to reach $1.245
trillion by the end of this year.
   ``There is no way out of the debt problem without a reversal of
the negative transfer of resources and a reduction in the debt
overhang,'' they said in a summary of their recommendations.
   The ``negative transfer'' refers to the estimate that payments
by Third World countries to the industrial countries last year were
$29 billion more than funds they received. This was largely due to
interest payments on the debt.
   The ``Group of 24'' speaks for about 130 countries of the 151
members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which
are holding semi-annual meetings in Washington this week.
   ``The overriding issue is that the volume of (aid) to developing
countries is inadequate to meet the needs of economic growth,
poverty alleviation, structural adjustment and the resolution of
debt difficulties,'' President Barber Conable of the World Bank
said in a report being presented this week.
   He added that if more money is not forthcoming, the debtors
would hold back some of their payments.
   There was little expectation of any debt relief on a large scale.
   Dutch Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding, chairman of the interim
committee that makes major IMF lending decisions, spoke earlier in
the day against ``grandiose schemes'' for debt relief.
   He spoke in support of the present policy of dealing separately
with each debtor nation, though he added it has been working for
some but not for others.
   Negotiators for creditors say any reduction in debt should take
place only in agreement with the creditors. They have accepted some
losses by stretching out _ what they call ``rescheduling'' _
payments of interest and by reconciling themselves that few heavy
debtors are paying anything on the prinipal they owe.
   Brazilian Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega, chairman
of the Group of 24, agreed that solutions should be
``market-oriented.'' He repudiated the practice of some debtors of
suspending interest payments without the consent of creditors.
Brazil did that for most of 1987.
   ``Withholding of interest is not good for the whole system,'' he
told reporters after the meeting.

<HEAD>Three Deaths Reported in Riots Against Gasoline Price Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government imposed a curfew
on a northern city Wednesday after riots in protest of gasoline
price increases. Newspapers said police shot three rioters to death.
   Nigeria's state radio reported the dusk-to-dawn curfew in Jos
and said some protesters were injured. It said the curfew was
imposed ``after a violent demonstration which paralyzed commercial
activity in the city today.''
   Three Lagos newspapers said their correspondents reported 15
people wounded, including an 11-year-old boy shot in the head and a
13-year-old who was wounded in the shoulder while selling soft
drinks on the street.
   Demonstrations are said to have begun Monday at the University
of Jos. The radio said the school was closed after the protests
became violent Wednesday.
   It said the situation was under control but several buildings,
including police stations and government offices, were damaged and
vehicles set ablaze. According to the radio, police fired tear gas
to disperse stone-throwing crowds.
   Gasoline and diesel fuel prices were raised by 3 percent
Saturday. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank
recommended higher prices for oil products to help reduce a
government budget deficit of $1.5 billion.
   Nigeria is a leading oil producer and, in the boom days of the
mid-1970s, its citizens came to regard cheap petroleum products as
a right. Even with the increases, gasoline sells for the equivalent
of about 40 cents a gallon compared with $4 or more in neighboring
countries.
   Bus fares were doubled in Lagos after the weekend price
increases and they rose by 50 percent in some other cities.
   The newspapers said violence in Jos began Wednesday when
protesting students were joined by taxi drivers and children who
rushed into shops and pulled people into the street.
   Col. Lawrence Onoja, governor of Plateau state, advised
residents to stay indoors. On Tuesday, he had told students to
return to classes and promised to relay their complaints to the
government in Lagos.

   An airliner landed on the wrong runway at London's
Gatwick Airport, forcing a Boeing 737 carrying 119 people to swerve
into the mud to avoid a crash, authorities said Wednesday.
   An air traffic controller spotted the potential danger and
prevented a collision, the Civil Aviation Authority said. The 236
people aboard the two planes were unharmed, it said.
   The incident happened Tuesday about 10:20 p.m. (5:20 p.m. EDT)
when a British Island Airways BAC-111 carrying 117 people was
arriving from Venice, Italy.
   At Gatwick, about 25 miles south of London, a British Airways
Boeing 737 with 119 people was moving along a taxiway toward the
runway for takeoff to the Greek island of Rhodes.
   Instead of landing on the runway, the incoming aircraft headed
toward the adjacent taxiway. When the tower notified the jet of the
error, the landing jet threw its engines into reverse and stopped
about 750 feet short of a collision, said an aviation authority
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At the same time, the British Airways plane, which was moving
slowly, swerved off the tarmac and came to a stop in the mud and
grass beside the runway, he said.
   The aviation authority launched an inquiry and provided no
immediate explanation for the near-disastrous error. But Gatwick's
sole runway had been closed overnight for repaving, and the
adjacent taxiway was being used as a temporary runway.
   Airport managers praised the traffic controller's alertness in
preventing ``an incident becoming an accident,'' a Gatwick Airport
spokesman said. He also commended the British Airways pilot for
responding ``quickly and positively.''
   The 1,300-strong Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators said the
incident highlighted the dangers of having just one runway at
Gatwick.
   ``The worry lies in the fact that the British Airports Authority
(Gatwick's operator) are digging up the main runway at one of the
busiest times of the year,'' said the organization's clerk, Capt.
Paul Wilson.
   The incident follows a series of recent near-collisions in
Britain's skies. The aviation authority says 16 ``risk bearing''
near misses occurred in 1986, the latest figures available. They do
not include incidents on the ground.
   The airport duty manager, Ian MacCorquodale, said the airport
was not overcrowded Tuesday night.
   Gatwick, the world's busiest single-runway airport, was closed
for 20 minutes while the British Airways jet was towed away
undamaged, the aviation authority spokesman said.

   Israel on Wednesday remembered 6 million Jews
killed in the Nazi Holocaust, and President Chaim Herzog said the
Jewish state was the only guarantee Jews would never again be
victims of mass persecution.
   ``Never again will Jews become helpless victims, never again
will they be defenseless, homeless people without shelter at a time
of distress, never again will their fate be subject to others,''
Herzog said in a ceremony marking Holocaust Day.
   Israel later this month celebrates its 40th anniversary, but the
festivities are overshadowed by the four-month Arab uprising in
which 146 people have been killed _ 144 Palestinians and two
Israelis.
   ``The creation of the state of Israel saved the Jewish people
from complete destruction,'' Herzog told several hundred people at
the televised ceremony at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial on
Mount Herzl. ``The Holocaust was so desperate it could have been
the death blow to the Jewish people.''
   ``Never again will there be another Holocaust, and the state of
Israel is a guarantee for that,'' Herzog added.
   Herzog also stressed that while Israelis may be divided on how
to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict, ``we are united in all issues
relating to the security of the nation, and there will be no
compromises.''
   Holocaust Day, officially called Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance
Day, marks the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943,
in which Jews armed with homemade weapons fought house-to-house
battles with Nazi troops backed by tanks.
   The ghetto fighters held the Nazis back for nearly a month.
About 56,000 Jews were killed in the battle.
   On Wednesday and Thursday, about 100 memorial services were
scheduled throughout Israel.
   From 8 p.m. Wednesday to sundown Thursday, restaurants, movie
theaters and other places of entertainment were ordered closed.
Police officials said they would strictly enforce compliance, with
violators being fined a minimum of $100.
   On Thursday morning, a siren is to sound throughout the country
and Israelis are to halt for two minutes to remember the victims of
the Holocaust.
   ``Those who were there and those who were not, those whose
family was killed and those whose family was not _ we are all the
second generation of Holocaust survivors,'' poet Rivka Miriam told
Israel radio.
   ``I grew up in a house without grandparents, without uncles and
aunts,'' she said. ``I felt that since I live and exist ... I live
for them, too.''
   Earlier this week, about 2,000 Israelis, including two Cabinet
members and six members of Parliament, flew to Poland for
observances of the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto revolt.
   It was the largest Israeli group ever to visit Poland, which
severed diplomatic relations with the Jewish state after the 1967
Middle East war. In 1986 the two countries established low-level
diplomatic ties.

   State education officials said Wednesday
they may nullify about 1,100 high school students' graduation tests
in Paterson after someone raced into a classroom and stole an
examination booklet.
   Eastside High School Principal Joe Clark, who has earned the
praise from President Reagan for his iron-fist, no-nonsense method
of ruling the urban school, claims someone was paid to steal the
test in order to embarrass him.
   ``It was the essence of chicanery and stealth,'' Clark said.
``It was done to denigrate and excoriate me.''
   Clark said he didn't know who was behind the Tuesday morning
incident, but called them ``adversarial forces.'' He claimed the
thief was not a student.
   Paterson Detective Sgt. Samuel Torres said he believes, based on
student accounts, the thief was a young man who attends the high
school. He said officers weren't able to track him down Wednesday,
but hoped to find him by Thursday.
   Approximately 1,150 Eastside students were scheduled to take the
test.
   Tuesday was the first day the High School Proficiency Test was
administered to about 130,000 students across the state. Students
must pass the three-part, three-day examination in order to
graduate. It is first taken in the 9th grade, but students in the
10th and 11th grades who failed the test in the past are also
taking the test this week.
   Assistant Education Commissioner Cummings Piatt says an
instructor was prepared to pass out the tests to five students in
one Eastside classroom when someone holding a hall pass walked into
the room.
   As the teacher inspected the pass, said Piatt, the individual
reached across a desk, grabbed one of the test booklets and ran.
   The teacher screamed for help, but hall monitors and others were
unable to catch up to the thief, Piatt added.
   He said that if there is evidence the booklet was circulated
among students, Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman and other
officials may determine that every student at the high school must
retake the test.
   Although the test is administered over three days, the booklets
include all three sections, said Assistant Commissioner Joel Bloom.
   Torres said he didn't believe that other students had seen the
test, but that he couldn't be sure until a suspect is apprehended
and questioned. He also refused to speculate about a motive.
   Clark discounted the theory that the suspect is a student, and
said a student wouldn't have been able to pull off the theft.
   ``The rigidity of discipline would have precluded that,'' he
said.
   Clark has been recognized by Reagan and U.S. Education Secretary
William Bennett for restoring order at the school, once known for
its violence and open drug dealing.
   Clark said the individuals behind the theft could include school
board members, city residents or state officials who are jealous of
his success.
   ``Being No. 1 makes you vulnerable,'' Clark added.

<HEAD>Computer Magazine Says Scientists' Deaths Don't Add Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deaths or disappearances of 15 British
scientists in six years is more than coincidence, but there still
is no proof the cases are linked, a computer magazine said Thursday.
   Computer News, a highly regarded industry weekly, analyzed in
its latest issue the string of cases dating back to March 1982.
   ``Computer News' feeling is that it's certainly more than a
coincidence,'' said Jane Lawrence, the magazine's editor. ``But we
have no conclusive evidence.''
   The government has admitted the spate of cases is odd, but has
insisted the frequency of the deaths is a coincidence, and rejected
calls for an inquiry.
   ``It is possible to believe that the official reluctance to give
information on these deaths is instinctive rather than
conspiratorial,'' the magazine said. ``It is equally possible to
believe that these cases are the tip of an iceberg.''
   Computer News said several of the scientists were working on
sensitive defense projects, particularly in fields relating to
signal processing, which is critical to detecting, identifying and
tracking targets.
   Many died in unexplained, even bizarre, circumstances, it said.
Most resembled suicides, although only two have been so ruled.
Eight died in 1987 alone.
   Computer News said speculation the scientists committed suicide
because of stress ``cannot be ruled out,'' although many relatives
felt the scientists had been in good spirits.
   The magazine said a particularly odd case involves Peter
Peapell, 46, found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage.
Peapell had a high-security job at the Royal Military College of
Science testing titanium's resistance to explosives.
   Peapell's wife, Maureen, said she last saw her husband alive
about 3 a.m. one morning in February 1987 after they returned from
an evening out. The magazine said she went to bed and left her
husband to park the car.
   About six hours later she awoke and found him dead under the
car, with the engine running and garage doors closed. Carbon
deposits on the garage door showed the engine had been running only
a short time.
   The magazine said Peapell's head was sticking out face-up from
underneath the car, his mouth virtually aligned with the end of the
exhaust pipe.
   It is not known whether Peapell knew John Brittan, who had left
the college to work at a Defense Ministry research establishment.
   Brittan also was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his
garage. He and Peapell died shortly after returning from business
trips to the United States.
   A young scientific officer at the college died in a mysterious
car crash in Cyprus in April 1987, the magazine said.
   Another scientist involved in signal processing disappeared four
days before Brittan died, but was traced four months later by a
British newspaper to a boutique in a Paris red-light district.
   Avtar Singh-Gida disappeared while finishing his doctoral thesis
on underwater signal processing at Loughborough University. He has
refused to talk about his disappearance or the death of an
acquaintance, Vimal Dajibhai, a computer programmer at Marconi
Defense Systems, an electronics firm.
   Dajibhai fell to his death from a bridge in August 1986.
   Questions also surround the October 1986 death of Ashhad Sharif,
another expert in advanced ignal processing, the magazine said. An
inquest ruled that Sharif killed himself by tying a rope to a tree,
looping the other end around his neck and then driving off in his
car.
   Four other digital communications experts died unusual deaths,
the magazine said, including one who drove a car filled with
gasoline tanks into an empty cafe.

   The military was on full nationwide
alert as President Corazon Aquino left Thursday on a four-day visit
to China and Hong Kong, her first trip abroad since 1986.
   Coup jitters have been aggravated by the recent escape of rebel
military officers, including former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan, who tried to overthrow the government in August.
   ``The prudence of this visit, at this time, after a recent
incident, has been questioned,'' Mrs. Aquino said before leaving,
in a reference to opposition calls to cancel the visit because of
Honasan's escape.
   ``On the contrary, its cancellation would be the greatest
folly,'' she added. ``For our visit to China will show our great
neighbor that we have at least achieved the internal political
stability and peace to play a responsible and important role that
is expected of us in Asian affairs.''
   Mrs. Aquino said the visit would also provide an opportunity to
meet China's new leadership and renew ``our mutual principal of
non-interference in each other's internal affairs.'' China stopped
supporting communist rebels in the Philippines after Beijing and
Manila established full diplomatic relations in the mid-1970s.
   Mrs. Aquino's last trip abroad was to Japan in November 1986.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino assured her Cabinet that maximum
security measures had been taken to keep the country safe during
her absence, according to Presidential Press Secretary Teodoro
Benigno. Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the 160,000-member
armed forces would crush any attempted coup.
   ``Nothing can happen that can topple the government in one fell
swoop,'' said Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, Manila area military
commander, on Wednesday.
   However, he said both military renegades and communist rebels
fighting the government for almost 20 years could still be
dangerous. ``Of course, these crazy guys running around out there
can commit some crazy things, like bombing some isolated facility
or even assassinating somebody.''
   Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, the country's most prominent clergyman,
appealed for peace Wednesday. He said he was praying ``to keep all
the enemies of peace and democracy away from our beautiful land''
during Mrs. Aquino's absence.
   After Wednesday's Cabinet meeting, Ramos announced the
nationwide troop alert and said it would remain in effect until the
president returns Sunday.
   He also said security had been doubled at a military prison near
Manila to prevent further escapes by 157 military officers and
enlisted men held in connection with the Aug. 28 coup attempt. The
most serious of several bids to overthrow Mrs. Aquino since she
came to power in February 1986, it left 53 people dead and more
than 300 wounded.
   Honasan, the alleged mastermind of that coup, escaped with 14 of
his prison guards April 2 from a ship where he had been held since
his December arrest.
   Three other soldiers held for previous coup attempts have also
escaped in the past two weeks.
   The military also said Wednesday that communist New People's
Army guerrillas fired on one of its helicopters shortly after it
landed near Dumaguete, about 400 miles south of Manila on Negros
island.
   Two colonels and two sergeants were wounded in Tuesday's attack,
the military said.

directors.''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of the National Symphony and the
New York Philharmonic were the top-paid music directors of leading
orchestras, each pulling in upwards of $600,000, according to a
survey of 1986 tax records published Wednesday.
   Mstislav Rostropovich earned $687,000 at the National Symphony
in Washington during 1986, and Zubin Mehta earned more than
$638,000 as music director of the New York orchestra the same year,
according to Internal Revenue Service records.
   The Baltimore Evening Sun obtained the 1986 IRS records. The
survey offers a glimpse into the inner workings of these
organizations, which usually steer clear of revealing financial
details.
   At other orchestras with glossy artistic reputations, music
directors apparently earn more modest salaries. The Boston Symphony
paid its music director, Seiji Ozawa, $381,000 in 1986, the
Cleveland Orchestra's Christoph von Dohnanyi earned nearly
$332,000, and the Chicago Symphony paid Sir Georg Solti $355,000 a
year earlier, the newspaper reported.
   Patty O'Kelly, a spokeswoman for the National Symphony
Orchestra, disputed the figure for Rostropovich and said auditors
were reviewing tax records in response to the Evening Sun article.
   ``We ... believe that Mr. Rostropovich's salary was misstated by
more than $200,000 due to an inadvertent error by our former
auditors...,'' Ms. O'Kelly said. ``We are having the form reworked
by our current auditors, ... and will be filing an amended return
in accordance with their findings.''
   She said Rosptropovich's exact salary would not be known until
the audit is finished.
   Music directors conduct their home orchestras only part of the
year. Solti and Rostropovich, for example, lead their orchestras in
a concert season that lasts only eight to 10 weeks per year, plus
whatever time is spent in rehearsal. Ozawa conducts Boston about 16
weeks during the regular season.
   When they are not appearing with their home orchestras,
conductors make guest appearances at other orchestras and at summer
festivals, which can significantly increase earnings.
   Private expense accounts and the royalties from recordings and
broadcasts are also not listed on tax returns. Some conductors,
such as Solti and Ozawa, record extensively.
   As tax-exempt organizations, symphony orchestras must file IRS
tax returns. Those documents require each orchestra to list its
five highest paid employees as well as the five highest-paid people
hired as consultants or other professionals.
   Despite this, at least one orchestra surveyed elected to omit
the music director's salary from its tax return. Philadelphia left
out any reference to music director Riccardo Muti from its 1985 tax
return, the latest available. The orchestra declined to comment to
the newspaper.
   In some cases, the payments are made to corporations set up for
tax reasons.
   Boston's Ozawa is paid through a corporation called Veroza Inc.,
which is an amalgam of his wife's name, Vera Ozawa. Rostropovich's
fees are paid to Pooks Concert Inc., named after the Russian-born
conductor's late pet, a miniature dachshund. The Minnesota
Orchestra expressed former director Neville Marriner's salary as a
range of $250,000 to $350,000. A notation informs the IRS that the
exact figure is available on request.
   Symphony salaries have come under increasing scrutiny as many of
the nation's orchestras suffer difficult financial times and turn
to taxpayers for assistance.
   The Baltimore symphony has steadfastly declined to reveal
financial details of David Zinman's new six-year contract as music
director, even though more than one-third of the orchestra's $9
million operating budget is underwritten by Maryland taxpayers. The
orchestra's 1986 tax return lists Zinman's salary as $193,500 for
the 1985-86 season, his first as music director.
   Most orchestras had similar responses to requests for comment,
the newspaper said.
   ``We've made it a longstanding policy not to discuss any aspect
of salaries,'' said Francis Little, spokesman for the New York
Philharmonic.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying that recent
reports that Lorin Maazel will get $1 million per year in a
contract set to take effect later this year at the Pittsburgh
Symphony were exaggerated.
   Nevertheless, music industry insiders believe that Maazel will
be the highest paid music director in America next fall, the
Evening Sun said. Maazel's salary at Pittsburgh in 1986, when he
was only a part-time music adviser, was $125,000.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is to sign an agreement Thursday
to pull its troops out of the Afghan civil war, where they have
suffered tens of thousands of casualties. Moslem guerrillas say
they will ignore the accord and fight on.
   U.N. envoy Diego Cordovez mediated the deal over several years
between Afghanistan and its eastern neighbor, Pakistan, where about
3.5 million Afghan refugees live. The Soviet Union and the United
States, which supports the guerrillas, will sign as guarantors.
   The insurgents, who began fighting after a Communist coup in
April 1978, were not included in the negotiations and say they will
ignore the result. Pakistan spoke for them in Geneva.
   Reports from Afghanistan indicate guerrillas have increased
attacks on Soviet and Afghan units since spring thaws opened their
mountain supply routes. The Kremlin sent military forces to
Afghanistan in December 1979 and now has an estimated 115,000
soldiers there.
   U.S. government analysts in Washington said Wednesday that large
numbers of Soviet trucks were sent to Afghanistan in the past week.
Some Reagan administration sources said the trucks carried 15,000
more troops, but other analysts said they were empty and were sent
to bring soldiers home.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, and
Secretary of State George P. Shultz will sign for the superpowers.
   Shultz is to arrive Thursday, about an hour before the ceremony,
and is scheduled to meet with Shevardnadze afterward. The fourth
summit of President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev begins May 29
in Moscow.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who directed Cordovez
to begin his mediation in 1982, will represent the United Nations.
   In Islamabad, Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo of Pakistan
said Wednesday of the Geneva agreement: ``The dark, dreary night
which has engulfed Moslem Afghanistan since December 1979, casting
its shadows on the entire region, is at long last vanishing from
the horizon. The dawn of victory is taking its place.''
   He praised Gorbachev for ``statesmanship, farsightedness and
courage,'' declaring that the Soviet leader ``chose the way of
peace, put a balm on ... the bleeding wound of the Soviet Union.''
   Junejo said Pakistan is indebted to Reagan for his ``determined
and principled support, which enabled the great freedom struggle to
meet with success.''
   Pakistan refused to deal directly with Afghanistan because it
does not recognize the Communist government, now led by Najib.
Cordovez shuttled between the two delegations during six years of
negotiations.
   Some elements of that problem persisted in arrangements for the
final ceremony.
   All signers agreed to convene in the same room, an ornate
chamber of the Palais des Nations, the Geneva U.N. office and
former headquarters of the League of Nations.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil of Afghanistan, however, will enter
through a different door than Pakistani counterpart Zain Noorani,
Cordovez said. The two are not expected to shake hands or exchange
documents directly.
   The agreement provides for withdrawal of all Soviet troops,
pledges by Pakistan and Afghanistan of non-interference in each
other's affairs, and the safe and voluntary return of about 5
million Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran.
   Moscow and Washington are to guarantee Afghanistan's future
non-alignment and the United Nations will supervise the settlement,
including the return of refugees.
   Soviet troops are to leave within nine months starting May 15,
with half the total gone by Aug. 15.
   There is no provision for an end to the war and the agreement
says nothing about the composition of future Afghan governments.
   Cordovez will continue promoting an internal Afghan settlement
by shuttling between the fighters and the government in Kabul.
   Another point left out of the accord is military aid.
   An informal understanding has been reported between the Soviet
Union and United States. Diplomatic sources say each superpower
will phase out such aid, while reserving the right to resume it if
the other side does.

<TEXT>
   A nationalist Arab newspaper for the first time
published a letter from an Israeli, a 13-year-old who called on
Arabs to end violence and start peace talks.
   The writer, Lior Kay of Tel Aviv, also said in the letter
published Wednesday that the Palestinian people should have their
own state.
   ``Through your newspaper, I'm asking the representatives of the
Palestinian people and the Palestinian children to stop violence
and start negotiations,'' Lior wrote in pencil.
   ``I would like Palestinian children to read my letter and I hope
for an answer, especially from people my age,'' he said.
   The two-page letter was published in full in Hebrew in the
pro-Jordanian An Nahar newspaper, based in Arab east Jerusalem. The
newspaper translated the text into Arabic.
   An Nahar's editor-in-chief, Issam Anani, said he published the
letter because it was the first he received from an Israeli and
because he wanted to see how Palestinian children would respond.
   At least 144 Palestinians and two Israelis have died in the
4-month-long Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``I'm an Israeli child, 13 years old, and I live in Tel Aviv,''
the letter begins. ``I like the Palestinian people, and I
understand the reason for your anger, which is your rejection of
the occupation.''
   Lior told An Nahar readers that violence and factional fighting
among Palestinians prevented them from achieving statehood. ``I
also want to point out that extremists among your people were a
reason for right-wing extremists among our people,'' Lior added.
   ``Your rejection of the occupation does not have to harm Israeli
children and pregnant women, and the solution won't come unless
there are negotiations between the two peoples,'' he said.
   ``You have a historical right and we have a historical right. We
should come to a solution which gives the Jewish people the right
to their own state, especially after what they have gone through,''
the letter concluded.
   There was no telephone listing for Lior's Tel Aviv address.

<TEXT>
   A 19-year-old sailor accused of
killing a shipmate's wife and child is incompetent to stand trial
and meets the criteria for involuntary hospitalization, a
court-appointed psychiatrist said.
   Walter T. Taylor has been suicidal since his arrest for the
killings, Dr. Ernest G. Miller said in a letter filed Tuesday with
Circuit Judge R. Hudson Olliff.
   Olliff will decide if Taylor is competent to stand trial. If
Olliff finds Taylor incompetent, the defendant will undergo
counseling at a psychiatric center until he is competent.
   Taylor is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the
killings last August of Paula Smits and her 3-year-old daughter,
Amanda. They died on Aug. 8 or 9, a few days after the USS Stark, a
guided missile frigate, returned to Mayport Naval Air Station.
   The defendant was a lookout aboard the Stark during the Iraqi
missile attack that killed 37 of their shipmates last May 17 in the
Persian Gulf. The victim's husband was aboard the USS Saratoga, an
aircraft carrier.
   Assistant public defenders Charles Cofer and Ann Finnell asked
Olliff last week to order a psychiatric examination of their
client, who is being held without bond in the Duval County Jail,
because he was staring blankly and refusing to answer their
questions.
   Assistant State Attorney Cheryl Peek, who is prosecuting Taylor,
said she will challenge the doctor's opinions during a competency
hearing scheduled for Friday.
   Miller said Taylor is suffering from post-traumatic stress
syndrome, which has been found in Vietnam veterans and victims of
violent crimes. The disorder was officially recognized by the
American Psychiatric Association in 1980.
   Miller also said Taylor's father is serving a prison sentence
for murder.

   Gov. Rose Mofford, freed from the threat
of a recall aimed at her predecessor, began filling empty slots in
state government Wednesday, but said she had not decided whether to
seek a full term in 1990.
   Meanwhile, Republican ex-Gov. Evan Mecham criticized Tuesday's
state Supreme Court decision canceling the recall election but
declined immediate comment on his own plans.
   In a radio interview Wednesday, Mecham said an appeal to the
U.S. Supereme Court of the state court ruling is ``a possibility
that's open to us,'' but he acknowledged the high court might not
agree to hear the case. There's also been no decision on whether to
appeal a Senate impeachment decision to the federal courts, he said.
   ``We've been handed a bucket of lemons and we're going to make a
barrel of lemonade,'' he told supporters Tuesday. ``There isn't
anything in the law, in the constitution, that says that the
Supreme Court can cancel this election.''
   Mecham had been scheduled for a live interview Tuesday night on
a KTSP-TV news program, but he walked off the set seconds before
airtime saying, ``There was not a meeting of the minds'' on the
format. Mecham said he wanted to read a statement, but KTSP news
director David Howell insisted on only questions and answers.
   Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, on Wednesday appointed a new secretary
of state to replace her in that position and said she plans to name
her permanent staff by Friday.
   She became governor April 4, when Mecham was convicted on
impeachment charges. She had been acting governor during the trial.
Mecham had hoped to regain the governor's post in the recall
election that had been set for May 17. In her comments to reporters
Wednesday, Mrs. Mofford, 65, declined to say if she would run for a
four-year term in 1990, saying it was ``a long way off.''
   She also said she hoped to begin sending nominations of agency
heads and commission members to the Senate for confirmation.
   State elections Director Jim Shumway was appointed secretary of
state after Karen Osborne, who had been serving as acting
secretary, turned the permanent post down, Mrs. Mofford said.
   Speaking with reporters after an appearance at a day care center
for state employees, she said she would oppose any effort by
would-be recall candidates to recoup expenses from the state and
had no plans for a quick State of the State address to the
Legislature because ``there's enough legislation there that needs
work'' already.
   The GOP-controlled Legislature's annual regular session began in
January and normally wraps up several months later. However,
Mecham's impeachment trial by the Senate took up so much time that
a delayed adjournment is expected, with a major sticking point a
1988-89 budget shortfall projected at $300 million to $350 million.
   Mrs. Mofford said she would concentrate on boosting Arizona's
economy. ``I plan to go out in the hinterlands,'' she said.
   In Tuesday's 4-1 decision on a suit filed by two taxpayers, the
state Supreme Court said that because Mecham already was removed
from office by impeachment conviction, the regular order of
succession must take precedence over the state constitution's
recall provisions.
   The justices did not give detailed reasons for their ruling,
saying they would issue a formal opinion later. Justice James Duke
Cameron provided the dissenting vote.
   Mecham still faces a May 19 trial on criminal charges accusing
him of concealing a $350,000 loan to his 1986 campaign.
   The impeachment trial ended with his conviction on charges that
he tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat and
that he misused a protocol fund by loaning $80,000 to his auto
dealership.

   The United States has plans to continue using
Pakistan as a covert resupply point for Afghan rebels so long as
the Soviet Union funnels weapons to the current regime in Kabul,
lawmakers briefed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Wednesday.
   The arrangement, as understood by both the Soviets and the
United States, is at odds with a deal under which the Soviet Union
is pulling its troops out of Afghanistan and Pakistan is pledging
not to intervene in its neighbor's affairs.
   ``This is planned, calculated ambiguity,'' said Rep. Charles
Wilson, D-Texas, a member of the Intelligence Committee and one of
the leading House supporters of the anti-communist rebels, known as
the Mujahedeen. ``We have said publicly to the Russians and to the
world that we are going to continue to supply the Mujahedeen.''
   Asked whether that aid would be accomplished overtly or
covertly, Wilson said, ``Everything has been done covertly'' and
noted that Pakistan continues to deny officially that they have
helped in U.S. rebel supply efforts.
   ``We fully expect the Soviet Union to accuse Pakistan of
violating this agreement, and we fully expect Pakistan to deny
it,'' he said.
   ``And we fully expect the Soviet Union to accuse us of
continuing to supply arms to the Mujahedeen, and we fully expect to
accuse the Soviet Union of continuing to supply a minority puppet
government in Kabul. And we fully expect our side to win,'' Wilson
said.
   Shultz, who separately briefed House members and senators on
Wednesday, was traveling to Geneva Thursday for a signing ceremony
for the agreement, which he will sign for the United States as a
guarantor of the accord.
   Wilson and most other lawmakers said they were satisfied with
Shultz's assurances that the rebels will continue to receive U.S.
aid, but a few staunch conservatives voiced objections to the
agreement.
   ``We're depending on assurances, the good faith of the Soviet
Union to abide by vague agreements,'' said Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill.,
who noted that the rebels themselves, whom the United States
recognizes as the legitimate voice of Afghanistan, have rejected
the agreement and vowed to continue fighting.
   ``I can't help but entertain a great deal of skepticism,'' Crane
said.
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Calif., said, ``I assume that there would
have to be some kind of violation of the accords'' to continue aid
to the rebels, because aid can only be supplied through Pakistan.
   ``My concern is that at some point they might be forced to live
up to the letter of the accords,'' Burton added. He said he feared
that the Soviet Union at some point would be able to turn any U.S.
covert supply effort in violation of the agreement into a
propaganda weapon against the United States.
   ``The Mujahedeen have the Soviet Union with their tail between
their legs, heading for the border,'' he said. ``The pressure
should be constant until the Soviets are completely out'' of the
country.
   Fourteen Republican senators, in a letter to President Reagan
made public Wednesday, said they were ``shocked that the United
States intends to sign as a guarantor to the Geneva accords,
despite the vehement opposition of the Afghan Resistance Alliance.''
   The senators said the U.S. action ``sends a tragic message to
the people of Afghanistan.'' The letter was released by Rep. Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H., a staunch backer in Congress of the anti-Soviet
guerrillas.

INSERT two grafs after 18th graf, ``Asked if...''; picks up 19th

<TEXT>
   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. said Wednesday
that rival Michael Dukakis showed foreign policy inexperience with
an ``unwise and irresponsible'' statement that he would reserve the
right to respond with nuclear force if the Soviets invaded Western
Europe.
   Gore said Dukakis had erred in ``saying that he would launch a
nuclear strike against the Soviet Union under ... specific
circumstances,'' but transcripts indicated the governor did not
make such a statement.
   Nonetheless, Gore accused the Massachusetts governor of
violating a long-held ``tenet of American foreign policy'' that
presidents and aspirants for that office do not spell out to the
Soviets or any other country how the United States would make use
of nuclear arsenals in response to agression.
   With New York's Democratic presidential primary one week away
and looming as crucial for his candidacy, the Tennessee senator
seized on comments attributed to Dukakis in an interview published
Wednesday in the New York Daily News.
   ``Governor Dukakis made a significant mistake in saying that he
would launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union under the
following specific circumstances,'' Gore said. ``That's unwise and
irresponsible, and it underscores ... that experience in foreign
policy is relevant.''
   Gore made his assault on Dukakis at a breakfast with business
and civic leaders on Long Island, and later with reporters.
   Dukakis' remarks were contained in a story in the newspaper
which quoted him as saying of the scenario of a Soviet attack on
Europe: ``Our present strategy in Europe assumes that if the
Soviets were to invade and conventional forces couldn't stop them,
we reserve the right to use nuclear force. I don't think that's
going to happen and in fact I see the opposite happening.''
   Gore also had criticism for rival Jesse Jackson, saying he had
displayed his lack of foreign policy experience with a remark
before the U.S.-Soviet agreement on intermediate nuclear weapons in
Europe was reached that he would unilaterally halt deployment. Gore
said the agreement would not have taken place had the United States
taken the position Jackson advocated.
   Gore also criticized Dukakis as ``a little murky'' on the
question of establishing an independent state for Palestinians, a
subject of campaign discussion in recent days as the battle for New
York's 255 delegates has focused on Middle East issues and the
concerns of the state's influential Jewish population.
   The Gore campaign, however, considered Dukakis' statement on a
nuclear response to be a major event in the New York campaign. San
Francisco fund-raiser and Gore adviser Duane B. Garrett said
Dukakis has shown he is ``error prone'' and compared the nuclear
statement to major gaffes of earlier campaigns: President Ford's
suggestion that Poland was not under Soviet influence and
Republican George Romney's remark that he had been brainwashed on
the issue of Vietnam.
   ``I see this as a major blunder of that caliber,'' said Garrett.
   Speaking to the breakfast group, Gore said neither of his
Democratic rivals had any foreign policy experience and, defending
his own statement, added: ``That's not a personal attack. It's just
fact.''
   He described the Dukakis interview as a ``fresh illustration.''
   ``One of my opponents said in an interview yesterday that he
would launch a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union if
they invaded'' Europe with conventional forces, Gore said in an
apparent misrepresentation of Dukakis' comments.
   ``It is a mistake. It is irresponsible to publicly state we'll
launch our missiles and trigger nuclear war under these
circumstances or those circumstances,'' Gore said. ``That's been
held in reserve and covered with uncertainty we want to exist in
the minds of our adversaries in this world _ for good reason.''
   Later, campaigning in Niagara Falls, N.Y., Gore stood by his
criticism of Dukakis and his characterization of Dukakis' remarks.
   ``I think it is most unwise for a president of the United States
or a major candidate for the presidency to be drawn into a
hypothetical discussion of when we would launch our nuclear forces
and trigger the destruction of human civilization,'' he said.
   Asked if he would rule out the use of nuclear weapons, Gore
said, ``I will not be drawn into a hypothetical discussion. ...
Governor Dukakis made a serious mistake in allowing himself to be
drawn into that discussion and then in saying that he would launch
a first strike against the Soviet Union if they launched a
conventional war on Europe.''
   During an appearance Wednesday night in Westchester County, Gore
read from a transcript of the newspaper interview and said Dukakis
had been asked whether he could conceive of the first use of
``strategic'' weapons
   ``NATO has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical,''
he said. ``The president of the United States has traditionally
refused to respond to that hypothetical.''
   Gore stood in front of the Love Canal hazardous waste site and
denounced the Reagan administration for what he said was a failure
to enforce environmental protection laws and a failure to see that
such sites are properly cleaned up.
   ``This administration's record on environmental protection is
disgraceful and Love Canal stands as a symbol of their
unwillingness to act,'' he said.
   As a House member, Gore chaired the first congressional hearings
into the dumping of hazardous wastes at the Love Canal site.

   Mother Teresa said Wednesday that
London's homeless living in cardboard boxes move her just as deeply
as India's poor, and that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pledged
to help.
   ``I find poverty in a rich country more difficult to remove than
poverty in a poor country,'' she said. ``Food aid can be gotten for
a famine, but food for these people?''
   The 77-year-old Roman Catholic nun, famous for her 1979 Nobel
Peace Prize and slight stature, made an unpublicized tour of
central London Tuesday with sisters of her Missionaries of Charity.
   The Albanian-Indian nun's charity mission, founded in 1950,
operates in 80 countries.
   She described her reaction to visiting London's homeless
Wednesday at a five-day Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary
Leaders on Human Survival at Oxford. The nun came to Britain to
join the group, which is discussing how to tackle world problems
like nuclear arms, pollution and poverty.
   She told reporters in London just before meeting Mrs. Thatcher
that she would ask the prime minister ``to give us a house for our
people,'' a hostel for the homeless.
   Her organization already operates two small hostels in London
but wants to establish a larger one.
   As she left the official residence nearly 40 minutes later,
Mother Teresa said Mrs. Thatcher pledged her help and that the
prime minister's response was ``wonderful. She wants to help us to
help our people.''
   The prime minister's office said the two women did not discuss
details of a hostel but that Mrs. Thatcher told Mother Teresa about
the work being done by British voluntary service organizations.
   Mother Teresa said that during her London visit, ``I went with
the sisters to bring a little bit of hot soup and food to homeless
people.''
   ``They were inside that cardboard box made like a little coffin.
I didn't know what to say. My eyes were full of tears.
   ``There was this man, lying there, protecting himself from the
cold, with no home and no hope. He looked up and said: `It's a
long, long time since I felt the warmth of a human hand.'''
   Also at the Oxford forum, Mother Teresa disagreed sharply with
advocates of contraception, urging ``natural family planning
methods'' instead.
   ``I never give a child for adoption to a family that uses
contraceptives that kill the power of love,'' she said. ``How can a
mother love another's child if she has killed the child of her
love?''

   Former Chicago Bears running back Walter
Payton was involved in the accidental shooting of the manager of
his suburban restaurant Wednesday, police said.
   The victim, identified as Elmer Hutson, was wounded about 3 p.m.
when a third man handed the gun to Payton, 33, and the weapon
discharged, Schaumburg Police Chief Kenneth Alley said at a news
conference.
   Payton was questioned and released and no charges are expected,
Alley said. Police also questioned Payton's wife Connie and four
other employees who all ``corroborate the same story,'' the chief
said.
   The third man involved was not identified.
   ``Walter was on the telephone sitting beside the desk,'' Alley
said, ``and placed the telephone back on the receiver and turned
back, and the gun went off striking Mr. Hutson in the left leg just
below the knee.''
   Hutson, 28, of Hoffman Estates was taken from Studebaker's
restaurant to Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights
where he was in stable condition, said Gail Hillery, nursing
supervisor.
   ``The patient is not in a life-threatening situation,'' she said.
   The gun, a French-made, 9mm semiautomatic pistol, was registered
to Payton, who had the proper owner-identification and
registration, Alley said.
   The weapon had been at the restaurant for several days, Alley
said, adding he didn't know why. Police planned to have the gun
tested at Payton's request to determine whether it malfunctioned
and how, the chief said.
   Payton, who retired from the Bears at the end of the past season
as the leading rusher in National Football League history, is a
part owner of Studebaker's. Nicknamed ``Sweetness,'' he retired
from pro football in January after 13 years.
   Payton and his wife, Connie, live in suburban Barrington with
their two children. He was Chicago's Father of the Year in 1986 and
is active in anti-drug campaigns and many charities.

<HEAD>Dukakis Hails Passage of Massachusetts' Universal Health Care Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis hailed an innovative
universal health care bill Wednesday as the product of broad
popular support despite its extremely narrow margin of approval in
the state Legislature.
   ``I'm very proud of the fact that Massachusetts will be the
first state in the nation, ever, to have legislation which will
guarantee basic health insurance to all of our citizens _ something
which is long overdue for Massachusetts and long overdue for the
country,'' Dukakis said at a Statehouse news conference.
   The governor, who has trumpeted the legislation in his
presidential campaign, said he had not decided when to sign the
bill. But it was widely expected that he would do so before next
Tuesday's presidential primary in New York.
   ``This is the culmination of months of work _ years, really _ by
a great many people in this state and across this country,'' he
said. ``We couldn't possibly have done it without the help ... of a
broad and very strong coalition'' of labor, business and health
care professionals.
   In fact, however, the bill barely passed the Legislature, which
is dominated by a 4-to-1 Democratic majority. The House accepted a
last-minute compromise version by a vote of 77-75, and the Senate
did the same early Wednesday by an 18-15 margin.
   The votes, which ended nearly nine months of intense legislative
debate and negotiations with a host of special interests, resulted
in a plan to guarantee health insurance to all Massachusetts
residents by 1992 at a possible cost of $1 billion.
   As late as Tuesday, labor unions were upset by a provision that
potentially could reduce public employee health care benefits by
removing the issue from collective bargaining.
   Legislative leaders, fearing they would be unable to get a
two-thirds majority needed to correct the bill, decided to put the
collective bargaining amendment in an unrelated bill, which Dukakis
promised to sign.
   Dukakis argued that the concern over ``rollbacks'' in public
employee health plans was the primary reason for the narrowness of
the vote. Citing public opinion surveys and a ballot question,
Dukakis said universal health care was an idea whose time has come.
   ``I think we're sending a very important signal out. That is
that 40 yeras after Harry Truman first proposed it, we're finally
on the road to basic health security,'' Dukakis said.
   The bill sets Jan. 1, 1992, as the deadline for businesses to
begin offering health insurance to their employees or begin paying
an unemployment surcharge to the state so it can provide coverage
to the estimated 600,000 uninsured residents of the state.
   Despite adding an exemption for businesses of five or fewer
employees, tax breaks, state-sponsored pooled insurance and the
possibility of outright state subsidies, Republican opponents
repeatedly warned that the bill would raise business costs,
bankrupt some businesses and discourage expansion of others.
   The two-part bill also renews the state's hospital financing law
and contains about $1 billion in hospital fee increases over the
next four years. About $95 million in additional new revenues was
added for 42 hard-pressed hospitals.
   Dukakis has budgeted $78 million in fiscal 1989 as the state's
share in the first full year of the four-year universal health care
phase-in. But cost estimates over four years vary widely _ from
$550 million to $1.2 billion.

<HEAD>Turkish Aliens Rally Outside Parliament To Protest Deportations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 1,000 Turkish aliens and their
supporters rallied outside Parliament Tuesday but gained no
concessions from the government in their fight against deportations.
   About 100 Turks had marched for nine days from Montreal to
Ottawa in a proptest against Canada's deportation policies. Some
said they planned to march back to the Montreal airport and ask
people along the route for help in their campaign.
   Immigration Minister Barbara McDougall told leaders of the
group, and later informed Parliament in a special statement, that
she would not give a reprieve to the Turks who have been ordered to
leave the country.
   About 2,000 Turks sold their belongings and flew to Canada two
years ago after travel agents in Turkey told them they would have
no trouble starting a new life in Canada as refugees.
   Most settled in Montreal and found jobs.
   But Canadian authorities subsequently declared that the Turks
were not legally refugees and said they should have applied to
immigrate through normal channels. About 400 returned to Turkey
voluntarily. The march was launched after the government began
issuing deportation orders to the others.
   Opposition parties asked the Immigration Ministry to offer
reprieves to the Turks for humanitarian reasons, noting the
government granted special admission to 40,000 refugees last year.
   ``They were just fooled by some crooks in their own country,''
said Liberal Party Sen. Jacques Hebert, who joined the march.
``They are here almost two years now. And then we say, well,
bye-bye. There's something cruel and inhuman in that.''
   But the immigration minister said waiving the rules for the
Turks would set a precedent for handling the backlog of 48,000
refugee claimants who entered Canada in the past few years under
immigration policies that she said were lax.
   The government has introduced two bills, now in the Senate, to
toughen the laws.
   ``We recognize they (the Turks) were victims of unscrupulous
travel agents,'' the minister said.
   She added she would approve immigrant visa applications for any
of the Turks who, once back in their country, applied through
normal procedures to come to Canada and live.
   But the Turks said they could not afford the transportation
costs.
   The people at the rally marched to Parliament Hill behind a
large white banner saying, ``Today the Turks, Tomorrow the Rest.''
   One man held up a small message reading, ``I love Canada. Please
let me stay here.''

<HEAD>White House Press Secretary Jim Brady Applauds Gun Control Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House Press Secretary James Brady, who
was injured by a shot from a Saturday Night Special in the
assassination attempt on President Reagan, applauded Maryland's new
gun control law Tuesday.
   At a news conference, Brady called the law ``one small step for
mankind, one giant step for Maryland.''
   On Monday, the Maryland legislature passed a law that would make
it the first state to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as
Saturday Night Specials. Gov. William Donald Schaefer has promised
to sign the legislation.
   Brady's wife, Sarah, had campaigned vigorously for passage of
the bill and called it ``a good first step.'' She said Tuesday she
hoped other states will follow Maryland's example.
   ``It's a wonderful victory for advocates of gun control,'' said
Mrs. Brady, who called the cheap handguns the ``No. 1 crime gun in
the country.''
   Mrs. Brady told legislators at a hearing earlier this year that
a $29 handgun that would be banned under the Maryland law was used
by John W. Hinckley Jr. in his 1981 assassination attempt that
wounded the president and left her husband partly disabled.
   Brady has held on to the title of press secretary despite his
injury and visits the office about once a week.
   The bill directs the governor to create a state Handgun Roster
Board headed by the state police superintendent. The nine-member
board will list guns that can be sold in Maryland and will be
required to withhold approval of:
   _Guns that are inaccurate, poorly made, easily concealed and
manufactured of cheap materials.
   _Guns made mostly of plastic or ceramic materials that can't be
readily detected by security systems at airports and public

   _Guns that have had the manufacturer's serial number obliterated
or altered.
   The bill provides fines of $2,500 to $10,000 for anyone who
sells guns not on the approved list. It will be illegal only to
sell the weapons, not to own them.
   Illinois, Hawaii, South Carolina and Minnesota have laws that
ban guns based on the melting point of the metal, according to the
lobbying group Handgun Control Inc. Guns with lower melting points
are of poorer quality and thus cheaper.
   However, both the National Rifle Association and Handgun Control
said no state regulates guns on the basis of accuracy, ease of
concealment, plastic or ceramic construction or the other
characteristics in the Maryland law.
   ``Clearly, this is going to add some impetus to other states
considering gun control laws. This is an example we'll be taking to
other states,'' said Michael Beard, executive director of the
National Coalition to Ban Handguns.
   ``I'm hoping Congress will look at what Maryland did,'' said
Attorney General J. Joseph Curran.``That's where this action is
needed.''
   But an NRA representative said he feared the spread of similar
legislation.
   ``I just hope it's not a trend-setting thing where a lot of
states start setting up boards,'' said NRA liaison Charles H.
Cunningham after the Senate's 35-10 vote Saturday. The House passed
the bill 95-41 Monday.
   The ban on the sale of Saturday Night Specials will take effect
Jan. 1, 1990. The board will be required to prepare a list of
approved guns by July 1, 1989.

<HEAD>Slovenian Parliament Begins Recall Initiative Against Federal
Goverment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Parliament of the republic of
Slovenia has begun an unprecedented recall initiative against the
federal government, the daily Dnevnik newspaper reported Tuesday.
   It said Miran Potrc, president of Slovenia's Parliament,
informed the republic's government that the recall measure has been
submitted by several Slovenian deputies.
   If the measure is approved, it will be placed before the federal
Parliament in Belgrade.
   A debate is scheduled May 15 in the federal Parliament on
Premier Branko Mikulic's first two years in office. It is expected
the government's dealing with the economic crisis may be challenged.
   Yugoslavia's authorities are grappling with a 170 percent annual
rate of inflation, unemployment of 15 percent, a $20 billion
foreign debt and growing labor unrest.
   Mikulic's government has faced unprecedented public criticism
for its economic policies, but this is the first time in communist
Yugoslavia that a legislative initiative has been launched for the
government to step down.
   No government or premier has resigned or been replaced since the
communists came to power after World War II.
   In an attempt to contain inflation, the government last November
introduced a six-month price and wage freeze.
   The move was bitterly criticized by Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most
economically developed republic. Slovenian leaders said the federal
government should not interfere in the economy.
   Mikulic has said the continuing problems are the result of a
lack of cooperation by Yugoslavia's six republics and two
autonomous provinces.

   A boiler room explosion Tuesday aboard a
ship in the Gulf of Mexico killed four crewmen and injured four
others, who were airlifted to a hospital, officials said.
   The explosion occurred aboard the 865-foot motor vessel Argo
Iduna about 5 p.m. CDT about 75 miles southeast of Galveston, the
Coast Guard said.
   ``The bodies are still aboard the Argo Iduna,'' said Coast Guard
Petty Officer 2nd Class Ron Mench in New Orleans. ``At last report,
they were trying to get the bodies out of the wreckage of the
boiler room.''
   Mench said the ship was of British registry and its home port
was Hong Kong. He identified the ship's U.S. agent as Deep Sea of
Galveston. The company is not listed in Galveston telephone
directories.
   Officials had not determined the cause of the explosion and
identities of the dead, he said, nor did he know the ship's cargo
and destination.
   ``As far as we know, the vessel is still seaworthy, it is
floating,'' Mench said. ``Of course, it has no power. They expect
it to be to towed by civilian tugs.''
   The four injured crewmen were airlifted in two Coast Guard
helicopters to John Sealy Hospital in Galveston, where they were
being treated Tuesday night, hospital officials said.
   They were identified as Remesh Chend, 30, in fair condition with
burns; Anthony Rodrigues, 28, in good condition with superficial
burns; J.R. Yadav, 29, in good condition with superficial burns and
Ratesh Kumar, 29, in good condition with a rib injury, said
hospital spokeswoman Leeann Teymour.

   The military rejected a suggestion by
the Pentagon that it was indirectly responsible for the death of a
U.S. Marine who was shot at a U.S. Air Force base.
   Cpl. Ricardo M. Villahermosa, 25, was killed Monday night while
investigating a suspected break-in at an underground fuel storage
depot at Howard Air Force Base, U.S. officials said.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said on Tuesday that Villahermosa
apparently was shot accidentally by fellow Marine guards, but added
there had in recent weeks been a series of intrusions by
``individuals who were uniformed and camouflaged'' at the base just
outside Panama City.
   ``When one has intruders into the base perimeter, who are in
uniform and are camouflaged, the assumption that one comes to is
that of course they are'' members of Panama's Defense Forces, he
told reporters in Washington.
   Panama's military called Howard's statements irresponsible,
saying they were aimed at justifying a military intervention.

   The Federal Aviation Administration's
ambitious modernization of its air traffic control system will cost
billions of dollars more than the agency estimates because of
unforeseen technical problems and delays, a congressional report
says.
   Largely because of unexpected problems in developing and
installing the new communications, radar, weather observation and
computer systems, the upgrading will cost at least $24 billion, the

   The FAA, which operates the air traffic control system and is

   The children wanted to know about the ghost
in the Lincoln Room, and President Reagan was pleased to tell them
that his dog Rex may have had an encounter.
   ``The president said his dog would go by the Lincoln Room, look
in, growl and back out,'' said A.C. Lyles, producer of
``Conversations With the Presidents,'' a one-hour show to be shown
on ABC on Saturday.
   ``Mr. Reagan told them, `Rex must see something I don't see.'
Mrs. Roosevelt used to talk about how Lincoln would come and visit
with her.''
   Lyles, who has known Ronald Reagan since their early days in
Hollywood, persuaded Reagan _ and former Presidents Ford and Carter
_ to talk with groups of children.
   Reagan talked to the children at the White House. Carter was at
the Presidential Center at Atlanta, and Ford at Rancho Mirage,
Calif.
   Former President Nixon withdrew from the show after ABC
announced a miniseries based on the book ``Final Days,'' which told
of his last days as president before he resigned.
   ``Ronald Reagan and I came to Hollywood about the same time,''
said Lyles, who has been with Paramount Studios for 50 years. ``I
saw a side I liked, the human side. Most people don't see that. I
thought what a wonderful thing it would be if children talked to
the presidents.
   ``I remember when I was just a kid working on the newspaper in
Jacksonville, Fla., and I interviewed President Roosevelt when he
came to town. I took the idea to ABC, got an OK. I mentioned it to
the president when I was on Air Force One, and he loved the idea.
Then I got in touch with the former presidents.''
   Lyles said he wanted children because they ask questions adults
would never think to ask. One child asked Reagan what he was
thinking about when he was sworn in as president. Another asked him
how he met the first lady and did they kiss on their first date.
   Carter told of being the first person in his family to go to
college, adding that he went to the Naval Academy because it was
free.
   ``Carter told them his house had no running water and there was
no electricity in the town,'' Lyles said. ``He said their only
source of entertainment was the radio. Every night they took the
battery out of the car and rigged it up to run the radio. Carter
was asked who he would like to play him in a movie, and he said
Robert Redford. Ford told them of being the only president who was
adopted as a child.''
   Lyles said he thought the children would be intimidated at going
to the White House to meet Reagan. ``But they went right in and I
think the president put them right at ease,'' he said. ``I don't
know who had more fun, the kids or the president.''
   The children, who were selected by the schools in each area,
ranged in age from 9 to 14.
   ``One girl told me her grandfather was going to tape the show,''
said Lyles. ``She said she could hardly wait to show it to her
kids.''
   Lyles talked about the show at Paramount studios, where he is
practically an institution. His office walls are covered with
dozens of pictures of himself with stars and other famous people.
On a tripod in his office is an old hand-cranked Mitchell camera
used to film ``Wings,'' the first movie to win an Academy Award.

<HEAD>Eugene Levy Profiles the `Despicable' Bobby Bittman</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Funnyman Bobby Bittman doesn't get much of a
reaction when he tells his nightclub audience that a crew is there
filming his life story, but Bittman cannot be denied.
   ``I think that deserves a little applause,'' the shameless
Bittman says, and he gets it.
   Slimy, grasping, grating and unfunny, Bobby Bittman is easily
the least lovable television character outside of a World War II
documentary.
   ``He's getting more despicable by the day,'' said SCTV alumnus
Eugene Levy, director, writer and star of ``Autobiographies: the
Enigma of Bobby Bittman.'' The Cinemax Comedy Experiment premieres
Saturday, and repeats April 19, 22, 24 and 28.
   ``I love the character, because it was the only character I did
on SCTV that was just revolting and obnoxious,'' Levy said. ``He
was fun to do.''
   Levy's SCTV work also included Mel Slurp, the nerdy host of
``Mel's Rock Pile,'' anchorweasel Earl Camembert, and Stan Shmenge,
the skinny half of the Shmenge Brothers polka act.
   In the Cinemax show, Bittman is even more offensive and
untalented than he appeared on SCTV's ``Sammy Maudlin Show,''
braying ``HOWARYA?'' and trading fawning tributes with the host
(Joe Flaherty) and his oleaginous sidekick William B. (John Candy).
   The Sammy Maudlin Show was a product of Second City's attempt to
start a theater in a shopping mall in Pasadena, said Levy, who was
part of a group picked from the Toronto and Chicago casts to open
the venture.
   In California, they discovered a parodist's promised land on
television _ Sammy Davis Jr. and ``Sammy and Company.''
   ``Oh, it was just hypnotic,'' Levy said.
   ``Sammy would bring someone on and say, `Isn't this man
marvelous, isn't he just marvelous? Could I say something about
this man right here? I know you don't want me to talk about it,
man, but I feel it's a story that has to be told ...'''
   Then he would gush about the charitable works of the guest, who
in turn praised the host, and so on. On the SCTV version, Sammy,
William B. and Bobby were often reduced to tears by the
magnificence of each other's hearts and talents.
   And no, there was no truth to speculation that Levy brought
Bittman to the Big Apple to catch some reflected glamour from the
``Rat Pack'' tour, which brought Davis and Frank Sinatra through
town a week earlier.
   ``I would have seen that concert had it come to Toronto, you
know. I would have paid $75 and gone and seen those boys,'' Levy
said.
   Instead, he got a review from fellow Canadian Paul Shaffer,
director of David Letterman's ``Late Night'' band, who is either
doing or has become a never-ending parody of Vegas.
   Shaffer found the ``Rat Pack'' show disappointing, Levy reported
sadly.
   ``I was kind of hoping it would be a great concert for them, in
some strange, perverted way, because it's like a bygone era,'' Levy
said.
   ``It's true, a lot of the basis for some of the characters we
did on SCTV, like the Sammy Maudlin show, their center of gravity
was '60s Vegas _ you know, the Shecky Greens, the Alan Kings and
that whole thing.''
   In his Cinemax autobiography, Bobby shows a lot of Jerry Lewis,
especially in his split with partner Buddy ``Dummy'' Phelps. And
the trademark ``HOWARYA!'' is a swipe at Marty Allen's ``Hello
dere!''
   This is no affectionate tribute; Levy's Bittman is more of an ax
murder in some swingin lounge scene, man.
   ``There are a lot of people that might say, `Why don't you end
this man's life and do us all a favor?' But no, I'm not through
with him,'' Levy said.
   While waiting for that sentimental ``Bittman and Company'' tour
in 2010, Levy is spending more time writing, and he's just signed a
deal with Disney to develop some television programs.
   He hopes, too, that SCTV can come back together.
   ``It was just a huge creative high doing the show, a lot of
great memories, and it doesn't matter what we've done since the
show, I don't think there has been any one project that has been as
creatively fulfilling,'' Levy said.

   Use the same baby sitter often? Hire a
college-student neighbor to cut your lawn during the summer?
   Have a regular housekeeper, governess, au pair, handyman,
gardener, butler or chauffeur?
   Congratulations. You are most likely an employer of domestic
help, eligible to pay Social Security tax, federal and state
unemployment tax, and maybe even withholding tax on the worker's
income.
   You may not think of yourself as a member of the ``Upstairs
Downstairs'' set with the kind of resources at your disposal to
preside over a household staff.
   But the rules say that if you pay anybody as little as $50 or
more in any calendar quarter for household services, you may have
yourself an employee for whom at least Social Security taxes must
be paid.
   People who have been through this sort of thing attest that it
is an experience full of paperwork hassles and the potential for
bureacractic nightmares, dealing with a wide variety of government
agencies.
   It doesn't take a cynic to acknowledge that a great many
household helpers around the country are paid ``off the books'' in
cash. This kind of work is a big and vigorous part of what is known
as the underground economy. It is not only cheaper to operate that
way, but also a whole lot simpler.
   However, household employers who either wittingly or unwittingly
fail to follow the letter of the law do so at their peril.
   Suppose you hire a regular baby sitter with the understanding
that the two of you will ``skip the heavy paperwork'' and that
payments will be made in cash. Things don't work out to your
satisfaction, and a few months later you dimiss the baby sitter.
   If only just to spite you, the baby sitter could decide to
report you to the authorities.
   Once they determined that you hadn't complied with the rules,
they would very likely start dunning you for payment of both your
and the baby sitter's share of Social Security taxes owed.
Together, that's 15.02 percent of all wages up to $45,000 a year.
   Add to the bill interest from the date the payments were due,
plus penalties of up to 25 percent of the amount owed _ and another
25 percent for failure to file the required returns.
   ``Furthermore, you could also be subject to penalties for
negligence,'' observes the accounting firm of Spicer & Oppenheim.
   Beyond Social Security, federal unemployment taxes must be
withheld for anyone whose pay exceeds $1,000 a year, while state
rules vary.
   Earnings for domestic work performed in a private residence are
not subject to withholding for income tax purposes, unless both the
employee and you want to handle it that way.
   One school of thought holds that you might as well go ahead and
do the income-tax withholding if you are already reporting and
paying the required Social Security and unemployment taxes.
   There is at least one legal way to get the household services
you want done without taking on the burden of becoming an employer.
   If a baby sitter, for example, comes from an agency that is in
the ``sitting service'' business and that sets the hourly rates and
conditions of employment, in most cases the service, rather than
you, is considered the employer.
   Beware, though, of trying to make such a case if the service
merely operates as an employment agency providing referrals.
   This is a fine distinction in an area of the tax rules that is
full of fine distinctions.
   In the daily busyness of life, it is easy to let such matters
slide. It also can be very costly.

<HEAD>Does a Housing `IRA' Make Sense?</HEAD>

   You can defer taxes while saving money for your
retirement sometime in the future, but you cannot defer taxes while
saving for the down payment on a home for the present.
   To some housing people, this constitutes a monumental
incongruity, and they would like to see a housing equivalent of
Individual Retirement Accounts, which allow many people to
accumulate funds without immediate taxes.
   Among other things, they contend that living well during the
pre-retirement decades is equally as important as living well in
the fewer years to follow.
   They concede that low-income retirement years can be difficult
without a supply of funds. But they counter by saying that low
incomes and big expenses of young couples can make them as
distressed as any retiree.
   Among others, the National Association of Home Builders is now
pushing a housing agenda for the 1990s that would allow interest on
savings to be tax-deferred if earmarked for the purchase of a house.
   You'll be hearing a lot about that agenda because hearings are
now being held around the country to assist Congress in gathering
data on the subject, and that data is liking to serve as a
blueprint for later action.
   While it can be argued that home builders will support almost
any legislation that makes their lives more comfortable, they do
have some telling evidence in support of a ``housing IRA.''
   First, there is the high price of housing. High is a relative
term, of course, but how can you argue that a fivefold increase in
housing prices over the last 20 years or so hasn't exceeded that of
most increases in incomes?
   Price, no doubt, has a lot to do with the falling homeownership
rate, especially for younger people. Since 1980, ownership for
those aged 25 years to 29 years dropped to 35.9 percent from 43.2
percent; for households aged 30 years to 34 years, the rate dropped
to 53.2 percent from 61.1 percent.
   The down payment is the big obstacle; once a house is owned it
may cost no more to finance and operate than a rented apartment. By
deferring taxes, it is argued, young couples can at least get a
foot in the door.
   Anyone who came through the Great Depression of the 1930s might
be inclined to have little sympathy for this predicament, since a
house of any kind was out of the question for most of them. But why
use that period as a criterion?
   A more cogent argument is that a home is both shelter AND
retirement fund. It can be lived in during working years, and in
retirement the house can become an annuity to support the owners as
their incomes fall.
   Reverse mortgages, the financial instrument for utilizing home
equity, have existed for at least a decade, although with little
popularity. Those who have them withdraw equity on a regular basis
to finance day-to-day expenses.
   The flaw in the house-as-retirement thesis is that pre-retirees
might tap the equity to finance expenses during their high-income
years _ with interest tax deductible, incidentally _ leaving little
for retirement years.
   The housing lobby is strong, however, and is dedicated to making
housing a national commitment through legislation. It isn't likely
to retreat from the challenge, since safeguards against abuse could
be built into an ``IRA'' law.

<HEAD>After 10 Years, States Still Falter on Campus Desegregation</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade after agreeing to desegregate their
university systems, Georgia and five other Southern and border
states still fall short of the goals.
   The six states have been chastised by the U.S. Education
Department for lagging in improving largely black colleges and in
better integrating the races at all public colleges.
   The president of one mostly black school says money _ funds for
capital improvements _ is the key. Billy Black, president of Albany
State College, noted that the Georgia Legislature usually approves
only half the budget requested by the University System of Georgia.
   ``There's no question but that these schools up until recently
were neglected,'' Black said in an interview at the campus here in
southwestern Georgia's pecan-growing country.
   ``If you have a couple-of-hundred-year history of being
underfunded ... you'll probably need some catch-up money to be
competitive,'' he said.
   But fatter budgets are not the only route to racial balance.
Georgia is also exploring another avenue: outright merger of such
``black'' colleges as Albany State with nearby white institutions.
   H. Dean Propst, chancellor of the state University System, is
expected to make final recommendations on mergers in May.
   The Education Department report in February sharpened the focus
on progress and problems at traditionally black colleges, which
last year enrolled 217,367 students and which account for 40
percent of blacks earning degrees in the United States.
   The report cited Georgia, Missouri, Delaware, Florida, Oklahoma
and Virginia for such shortcomings as poor facilities on black
campuses and failure to meet goals for recruiting blacks for
white-dominated colleges, and whites for mostly black colleges.
   The goals were set in 1978 in agreements between the states and
the federal government, which had accused the states of violating
the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   At the time, Washington officials said the states, though no
longer segregating colleges by law, had not eliminated vestiges of
segregation from their ``dual'' systems of higher education.
   In the February report, Education Secretary William Bennett
asked the six governors for formal assurances they will carry out
building, repair and other projects to fulfill the plans.
   Samuel Myers, head of a Washington-based group that lobbies on
behalf of 117 traditionally black colleges, says facilities are
being upgraded and more programs offered at black schools,
attracting more students of all races.
   But Myers, president of the National Association for Equal
Opportunity in Higher Education, says further improvements are
needed to ensure equal educational opportunities.
   ``The consensus is that none of these states has done all that
they should do or all that they said they would do,'' he said.
   In the case of Georgia, Bennett ordered officials to:
   _Complete a business administration building at largely black
Savannah State College.
   _Renovate a complex at Fort Valley State, another mostly black
institution.
   _Better promote transfers from predominantly white Darton
College, a two-year institution, to four-year Albany State.
   _Start an agricultural extension program administered jointly by
the University of Georgia and Fort Valley State.
   In an interview, Chancellor Propst said the building projects
are in the works and other deficiencies should be easy to correct.
   Kay Miller, the chancellor's spokeswoman, says the capital
improvements mean the state spends significantly more per student
at black colleges than at other schools _ an annual $11,315 at
Albany State, for example, compared with $5,449 at traditionally
white Valdosta State College.
   The Bennett report covered 10 states. Four _ West Virginia,
Arkansas, North Carolina and South Carolina _ were found in full
compliance with their desegregation plans.
   Three other Deep South states _ Louisiana, Mississippi and
Alabama _ never submitted desegregation plans. The Justice
Department eventually took them to court. The Mississippi case was
recently dismissed; the others remain in litigation.
   The Education Department said the 10 states covered in the
report have spent more than $240 million enhancing black colleges.
In addition, Congress appropriated $73.2 million for support this
year.
   But after Bennett made his formal assessment of progress,
critics of the Reagan administration contended he should have been
tougher on the states, concentrating more on integration of
students and less on physical improvements at black campuses.
   After years of desegregation efforts, Albany State remains
overwhelmingly black. Of 1,994 students enrolled for the winter
quarter, 366 were white, five were Hispanic, two were Asian and
three were American Indians.
   But the college, which 10 years ago had less than 4 percent
white enrollment, has met the plan's general goal of a
20-percent-white student body and is now focusing on new buildings
and expanded programs.
   It will soon have a new campus entrance, more paved parking
lots, a $6 million library, and a new nursing and allied health
center. In the longer term, a performing arts center, a new
administration building and a new physical education complex are
planned.
   ``We had unpaved streets, unpaved parking lots, and the lighting
was terrible,'' recalled Walter Burgess, the business school dean,
who joined the faculty 14 years ago. ``I've seen tremendous
changes.''
   Albany State has six ``2-plus-2'' academic programs aimed at
boosting white transfers from the two-year Darton College and
offers $200,000 in annual scholarships to encourage whites to
attend.
   One white student, physical education major Carlton Fletcher,
said he is impressed with the Albany State teachers. As for the
facilities, ``some of the buildings are really old, but the newer
buildings are as fine as I've seen.''
   Few expect a speedy integration of Georgia's state colleges.
   Ingrained attitudes from the days of official segregation
prevent it, said Albany State sophomore Roger Collier.
   ``A black person is not going to go to a white school because
they would feel uncomfortable,'' said Collier, a black marketing
major. ``I see whites walking around the campus and ... they don't
socialize. You pass them and they don't ever say hello.''
   The Rev. Clarence James, a black educator, said historically
black colleges, if integrated, lose some benefits of environment
and development they can offer black students, and eventually lose
their black character as well.
   ``The racial reality is that there are no 50-50 institutions,''
said James, assistant admissions director at Morehouse College, a
private black institution in Atlanta. ``Once a school becomes 20 or
30 percent white, the shift is going to go on ... eventually to a
90-10 (white-black) split.''

<HEAD>Odyssey Of Lutheran Leader Personifies Ecumenical Change</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   When he was a boy on the way to school in
Litchfield, Minn., his route went by a Roman Catholic Church. It
then seemed such an alien place that in passing it, he would cross
to the other side of the street.
   Now, as head of his Protestant denomination in a new ecumenical
climate, he confers with the pope in Rome and moves about the
Vatican as a trusted friend.
   The change, in the short span of youth to maturity of Lutheran
Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, depicts the swift transformation of
Christianity into a broader, shared household.
   ``I have the strong sense that I entered a home with many rooms,
and that I was privileged to go into four of them,'' he says of his
recent visits to four centers of the faith.
   As the head of the newly merged Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, inaugurated in 1988, Chilstrom made his get-acquainted
journey to inject a personal dimension to links with other churches.
   It signified ``that we are part of a great family of
Christians,'' he says.
   On his January trip, he visited the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch
Demetrios I in Istanbul, Russian Orthodox Patriarch Pimen in
Moscow, Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie in London
and Pope John Paul II in Rome.
   As a Lutheran, whose denomination bears the name of the 16th
century reformer, Martin Luther, who sparked the Protestant break
from Rome, Chilstrom's reception at the Vatican most pointedly
dramatized the new ties.
   His aides at the Chicago headquarters of the new
5.3-million-member denomination gave this account:
   Seated with the pope beside a desk in the papal library,
Chilstrom told the story of how as a boy on the way to school he
took to the far side of the street to avoid coming close to nuns
outside a Roman Catholic Church.
   ``I consider it a gift of the Spirit that I have now come
here,'' he told his Vatican host.
   The pope, smiling at how old aversions had gone, voiced
optimisim about ecumenical efforts, citing important progress in
U.S. Catholic-Protestant dialogues, and said steps must be found to
make unity visible.
   Chilstrom said he had helped officiate at the marriage of his
Lutheran niece to a Catholic and hoped that someday the couple
would be able to take Holy Communion together.
   Lack of agreement on sharing in that Lord's Supper, the central
act of Christian worship, remains one of the most poignant barriers
between Rome and Protestantism.
   The pope said of inter-communion he was ``keeping that hope
before us,'' seemingly implying that the churches may not have to
resolve all their theological problems before positive steps could
be taken.
   The Lutheran bishop was greeted with a hug by Cardinal Johannes
Willebrands, head of the Vatican secretariat for promoting
Christian unity, recalling their meetings in the U.S.
   Chilstrom also met other Vatican cardinals, including Joseph
Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's section on doctrine.
   He pointed to new potentialities in a study by German Catholics
and Lutherans about lifting the mutual 16th century condemnation's
of each other's churches, a step necessary for communion between
them.
   Eastern Orthodox Patricarch Demetrios I of the ancient see of
Constantinople (modern Istanbul) told Chilstrom ``we meet in the
same faith and have the same goal of celebrating the holy sacrament
together.''
   In a two-hour conversation with Orthodox leaders, Chilstrom said
Lutherans ``are an activist church _ very practical minded,'' but
had a ``growing desire ... for spiritual deepening.
   ``You have the gift that we need to know more about.''
   In Moscow, greeted by the ailing Russian Patriarch Pimen and
meeting with other Russian Orthodox leaders, Chilstrom said that
``when we reach out we learn not only about your faith but we
enrich ours as well.''
   In London at Lambeth Palace, Archbishop Runcie, head of the
world-wide Anglican Communion, voiced joy at the interim sharing of
Holy Communion between U.S. Episcopalians and Lutherans.
   In Rome, countering Chilstrom's story about his boyhood
avoidance of a Catholic church, Willebrands told of his own boyhood
in Holland when neighborhood Protestant and Catholic boys each year
set a day for a fight.
   They would line up across from each other and, on signal, began
slugging away. But Willebrands said he and a next-door Protestant
lad were friends, and they always made sure they were not opposite
each other.
   In more ways than one, Chilstrom says, the trip convinced him
that the old battlers are a lot alike. He says, ``The family of
God's people, with its rich diversity, shares much in common that
needs to be affirmed.''

   A study by a University of Akron sociologist
finds that religion contributes to a happy life, a comfortable
marriage and a positive outlook on personal health.
   Based on a survey of 560 Akron residents, sociologist Margaret
Poloma said simply feeling close to God is more important to
overall happiness than church attendance, denominational
affiliation or specific religious creed.
   She says the indications are that the frequency of prayer does
not directly relate to a sense of well-being, but the type of
prayer does.
   ``Those who use a conversational type of prayer are more likely
to feel good about their lives than those who limit themselves to
reciting memorized prayers,'' she says.

<DATELINE>BARGOU, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A speckled, swirling mass crossed the
horizon at midday and circled like a huge, amorphous buzzard, then
vanished over the northern hills.
   ``We've got a swarm!'' a locust tracker shouted at a driver, and
ordered him to speed into town with the alarm.
   After 30 years of grace the locusts are back, cutting a swath
from the desert to the rich agricultural lands of North Africa and,
possibly, beyond.
   They have settled on the doorstep of Tunis, the seaside capital.
On its outskirts, an infested cemetery shivers with a strange new
life.
   Thousands of dead locusts have washed up on beaches outside
Rome, carried across the Mediterranean by the same winds that
pushed the Bargou on its northward course. Winds determine the
course of a locust swarm.
   Moving in waves from Mauritania, desert locusts have infested
Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. They now are overrunning the
Atlantic islands of Cape Verde, off Mauritania.
   ``The magnitude of this plague is probably greater than the one
which struck the region in the 1950s,'' Edouard Saouma, head of the
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, said at his office in Rome.
The 1950s plague ravaged farmlands for years.
   His agency predicted a general invasion of the Sahel countries
on the southern edge of the desert in June if the North African
swarms are not reduced before the winds shift. Authorities said a
swarm covering 160 square miles was sighted in Tunisia early in
March.
   The one over Bargou, 100 miles southwest of Tunis in north
central Siliana province, had settled by nightfall in the hills and
groves of Borj el Amri, 15 miles from the capital.
   ``It was as big as a cloud. When I saw it I got scared,'' said
Youssef Mojhanmi, owner of an infested almond grove. ``People were
making noise, burning tires to stop the locusts from settling. But
they kept coming down.''
   Mojhanmi was happy, however, because his grove was saved. Local
officials had enough warning and began ground spraying soon after
the landing.
   By dawn, locusts were dropping in mounds under Mojhanmi's almond
trees or clinging stiff-legged to the branches. Tree trunks lining
the property seemed to writhe, covered with finger-sized insects
trying to escape.
   High winds limited aerial spraying at daybreak but falling
temperatures had immoblized the insects, which need a body heat of
77 degrees to take flight.
   Affected countries are mobilizing all available resources and
calling for aid. Locusts eat the equivalent of their own weight
every day and could devastate the food supply of North Africa's
agriculture-based economies.
   The FAO has said $150 million is needed to fight the plague.
   No official damage estimates have been available since the
locusts first were sighted in Morocco in October, and there is no
indication of widespread crop loss so far. Tactics have been either
to contain the swarms in non-agricultural areas or strike them when
they settle.
   ``We're trying to do the maximum killing at the Algerian
frontier,'' said Malek Ben Salah, director of Tunisia's
agricultural production ministry.
   Efforts to kill the flying hordes have led to violations of bans
on toxic pesticides. Tunisian authorities acknowledge minor cases
of poisoning, attributing them to improper use of masks during
spraying or eating chemically treated locusts.
   Some experts have reopened discussion on the toxin dieldrin,
suggesting its long-lasting poison could break the plague cycle,
but Lukas Brader, director of the FAO locust operations emergency
center, said it would not be used.
   Brader said aid donors and affected governments made the
decision at a meeting April 6-7 sponsored by the U.N. agency.
   Since the locusts arrived March 8, Tunisia has mounted a
veritable war with a national command post, regional situation
rooms, watch committee and a council that is led by the prime
minister and includes the defense minister.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development sent a team of
experts last week to provide technical and logistical support.
   A tour with the U.S. team revealed a patchwork of infestation.
   Carpets of dead and dying locusts _ pink, brown and yellow _
covered fields, groves and pine forests. The area stretched from
western oases around Gafsa near the Algerian border, where the
locusts entered Tunisia, to Cap Bon in the northeast, the nation's
breadbasket.
   ``The situation is changing very rapidly,'' said Jeremy Roffey,
the FAO locust expert. ``The swarms have moved north and many have
blown into the Mediterranean.''
   Since flight paths are determined by the wind, swarms now are
entering Tunisia through a northern corridor, moving straight to
rich farmland.
   By April 3, Tunisia had treated only 127,300 hectares compared
to more than 1 million treated in Morocco. One hectare equals 2.47
acres.
   Mehrez Chebil, entomologist with the agricultural production
ministry, said: ``The problem is much more serious with us because
our agricultural zones are directly threatened'' and Tunisia is
``fighting two plagues at the same time.''
   Because of a drought afflicting the country, only 18 percent of
the land planted in cereal grains is expected to produce a normal
harvest this year, officials say.
   When a swarm lands, teams attack it at night with ground
spraying and continue with aerial treatment in the morning when
feasible. National telvision tells people what to do when the
locusts come, and cars mounted with loudspeakers warn them when
treatment starts.
   ``This is the very beginning of a plague,'' Christopher Hemming,
a British locust expert on the U.S. team, said after seeing mounds
of dead locusts in an olive grove outside Kairouan, about 100 miles
south of Tunis.
   Local officials estimated the number of dead locusts under the
800 trees at 460 million.
   More than 250 species of locusts exist. Among the most
formidable is the Schistocerca gregaria, or desert locust.
   It is about three inches long, with a wingspan of twice that,
nearly weightless and like a piranha on the land.
   Beginning as earth-bound ``hoppers'' in larva form, they
accumulate and nestle, then move into their swarming _ and ravenous
_ phase, poised for takeoff with the right combination of hot wind
and humidity.
   A swarm, churning inward, downward and upward, can remain a
cohesive entity for weeks.
   ``Seeing a swarm from the inside, you get the impression of
towers of locusts,'' said Hemming. ``Someone once described it as a
column of advancing, tilting cigars.''
   Expert estimates of swarm density range from 125 million to 250
million locusts per square mile.
   Most accounts trace the origin of this plague to the summer of
1987 in regions of northern Ethiopia, southern Sudan and northern
Chad that could not be treated because they were theaters of war.

   A single fluttering desert locust has
the innocence of a hummingbird, but millions in a swarm are as
devastating to farmland as a prairie fire.
   A reporter accompanied experts from the U.S. Agency for
International Development on a two-day tour of infested areas in
Tunisia, which like the rest of North Africa faces the worst locust
plague in 30 years.
   Its netlike wings and pink, brown or bright yellow shell over
the locust's 3-inch-long body are an intriguing sight up close,
although short on beauty.
   Visiting land infested by locusts is an experience like no
other: walking on the writhing carpet of dead or dying insects,
seeing them cling to leaves and branches with spiny black legs in
what, to a farmer, is an embrace of death.
   Tree trunks, alive with them, appear to move. Locusts knock
against an intruder in the desperate attempt to escape.
   Crawl over an obstruction and a hand comes down in a patch of
insects. Settle to take a photograph and the ground crunches.
   Look down and they are crawling up your leg. Others settle on a
companion's shoulder, another's hat.
   With the U.S. team, led by Robert Thibeault of the U.S. Office
of Foreign Disaster Assistance, we pursued a swarm from central
Siliana province to its landing ground southwest of Tunis, in Borj
el Amri.
   After relaying a sighting over Bargou to a passing motorist, we
moved on to Kairouan, whose local watch ommittee said the swarm had
landed outside Tunis.
   Up at 4:30 the next morning, we hurried north again, arriving
for the finishing touches of an attack with insecticides on an
infested almond grove.
   Millions of locusts were dead, a rustling crunch underfoot, but
those that escaped the chemical fog scurried over a cemetery across
the road.

<HEAD>Chicago's Proposed Housing Value Insurance Draws Fire As Racist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joyce Zick saw it happen in her old neighborhood.
As Hispanics and blacks moved in, middle-class whites fled,
frightened by real estate agents fanning fears of declining
property values.
   ``When the panic peddlers came through, my parents made a
conscious decision to stay and live with the families who moved
in,'' Mrs. Zick recalled. ``They stayed and the property values
declined. Then the neighborhood changed again and the property
values declined again.''
   Today, Mrs. Zick is working with a homeowners coalition lobbying
the City Council to pass a plan designed to prevent drops in
property values and halt middle-class flight from racially changing
neighborhoods.
   But the plan, known as ``home equity,'' has drawn fire from
black leaders who contend it's intended to maintain segregated
black and white neighborhoods.
   ``It's saying that as a direct result of blacks moving in, the
economic stability and vitality of a neighborhood is undermined,''
said Alderwoman Marlene Carter, who is black.
   ``I'm insulted by it,'' she said. ``I think it's motivated by
racism under the guise of economics.''
   Supporters of the plan contend home-equity would benefit
minority middle-class homeowners as much as whites.
   Under the proposal, participating homeowners would pay a special
property tax _ $10 to $25 a year _ and the money would be used to
create an insurance fund. The fund would guarantee the resale price
of a person's home at its appraised value.
   If the home sold for less than its appraised value, the plan
would allow the homeowner to collect the difference from the home
equity fund. To be protected by the fund, a homeowner would have to
maintain the house in good condition and not sell for at least five
years.
   Supporters of the plan say home equity would take away the fear
some white homeowners have that their property's value will decline
if the racial makeup changes in their neighborhood.
   Once that fear is removed, home-equity supporters argue, whites
will be more likely to stay in a neighborhood when blacks or other
minorities move in, thus promoting natural integration and keeping
the white middle-class in the city.
   ``It doesn't matter what race you are _ this will protect the
value of everyone's home,'' said Alderman William Banks, who is
white and who co-sponsored the proposal. ``Everybody's money is the
same color _ green.''
   The City Council is weighing a proposal to establish home-equity
pilot programs in two predominantly white neighborhoods. If the
City Council doesn't act by May 1, Illinois House Speaker Michael
Madigan says he will push for a statewide program.
   ``The program is a psychological tool _ it makes people feel
confident they won't lose their property value,'' said Philip
Nyden, who studied the issue with fellow Loyola University
sociologist Kathleen McCourt.
   ``We saw this program as a way to intervene in this process and
build stable, middle-income neighborhoods that are integrated,''
Ms. McCourt said.
   Nyden added that ``the biggest winners of the home-equity
program would be the black middle-income homeowners who have a
tough time finding homes and have the most to lose if their
neighborhoods deteriorate.''
   Oak Park, an integrated suburb on the western edge of Chicago,
was the first community in the nation to enact a home-equity
program, Ms. McCourt said.
   Although Oak Park has never had to pay a claim from its
home-equity fund, she said, it instituted the plan in the late
1970s to prevent white flight when adjacent Chicago neighborhoods
became predominantly black.
   The 1960s and 1970s saw real estate agents engaging in a kind of
``block-by-block resegregation,'' she said.
   ``Their policy was to show blacks homes on a block-by-block
basis after several blacks had already moved in,'' she added.
``There was a lot of panic peddling at that time _ white people
being told they better sell their home quickly or they wouldn't get
a good price for it.''
   Mrs. Zick, for instance, says her parents were pressured to sell
when Hispanics began moving into the West Side neighborhood where
she was raised.
   She says her mother, now 78, resisted the tide of middle-class
white flight and stayed until last summer, but finally sold the
family home and moved to the suburbs because crime grew so bad.
   ``She lived under siege,'' Mrs. Zick said. ``There were gunshots
in the night, and she'd look out and see a dead body on the
street.''
   From 1960 to 1980, Chicago lost 263,278 middle- and upper-income
families, according to a report by the Save Our Cities-Save Our
Neighborhoods coalition, a homeowners' group pushing the issue.
   Last April, voters in predominantly white northwest and
southwest Chicago overwhelmingly approved advisory referendums
calling for testing home equity in their neighborhoods.
   Jane Sobczyk, a homeowner on the city's northwest side, says the
program is widely supported in her middle-class neighborhood of
ethnic Polish, Filipinos, Italians, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.
   ``This is really talking about middle-class communities wanting
to keep their middle-class socio-economic base,'' she said. ``It's
a socio-economic issue _ it's not a color issue.''
   But Ms. Carter contends that by requiring homeowners not to sell
their houses for five years in order to qualify for home equity,
the program is ``designed to hold the line on integration.''
   ``It's in some people's interests to polarize the community and
pit different neighborhood groups against each other,'' said Erik
Wogstad, the Save Our Cities coalition's project director for home
equity.
   Ms. Carter and other black aldermen are painting the issue in
white vs. black terms to win political support from their
constituents, he asserted.
   The Chicago Board of Realtors, which has 3,000 members, also
opposes the program.
   It contends federal equal housing laws have eliminated the need
to protect homeowners from so-called ``panic peddling'' real estate
agents and views the program as ``a slap in the face'' to
minorities, said Tom Hughes, the board's executive vice president.
   Helen Coston, a middle-class black homeowner, doesn't object to
the program for racial reasons, but says she doesn't think it would
stabilize a racially changing neighborhood.
   When she and her husband moved to the Chatham neighborhood on
the South Side 30 years ago, there were only a few blacks in the
area. Gradually, all the whites left _ but not because of declining
property values, which she says have doubled and tripled.
   ``I would think probably back then the whites just didn't want
to live around blacks,'' she said. ``I think if a person wants to
move, I think they would move whether or not the plan was in
place.''

<HEAD>World Has Plenty of Food, If Hungry People Can Afford It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of plenty, the world seems to be
losing some of its flab. The record global grain stockpiles are
receding and consumer demand is helping push up prices a bit.
   It's sort of an economic twilight time, an uncertain period that
might portend another world food crisis of the sort that occurs
periodically, often when there is massive crop failure or other
catastrophe.
   On the other hand, American farmers have idled millions of acres
under government crop programs, and those could be put back to work
in short order if the need arises.
   Meanwhile, world population keeps increasing, so in the long run
farmers will have to produce even more to fill the orders. Maybe
the idled land will have to be put back into crops, regardless of
the weather, blight and locusts.
   A monthly supply-and-demand analysis issued last week by the
Agriculture Department showed that the world stockpile of grain _
including wheat, corn and milled rice _ is expected to be about 165
million metric tons at the end of the 1987-88 marketing season.
That would be a 19 percent drop from more than 203 million tons
left over at the end of 1986-87.
   The overall figure includes a 32 percent drop in the size of the
wheat inventory; a 40 percent decline for rice; and a 16 percent
drop for corn.
   The statistics showed that the inventory declines resulted from
smaller harvests in 1987-88 and a rise in consumption.
   Last fall, the Washington-based consulting firm of E.A. Jaenke &
Associates noted in a series of articles that it's ``too early to
declare victory'' over world hunger, despite what some of the
experts say.
   ``We do that every 10 years,'' the Jaenke report said. ``In the
mid-1960s, following massive U.S. grain shipments to feed the
starving in India, the Green Revolution emerged to erase food
deficits in South Asia and create general optimism that hunger was
a thing of the past.''
   But by 1974, hunger had broken out again.
   ``There was bad weather in the Soviet Union and Africa, a poor
fish crop off Peru, and of all things: a grain shortfall in the
United States,'' the report said. ``Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger called a world food conference in Rome, and sure enough
the problem was solved within a year.''
   But in 1983-84, the ``most publicized food crisis of all
occurred in some two dozen countries of Africa,'' the report said.
``The U.S. and other nations responded with food and money, and the
American pop music industry organized a transatlantic `Live Aid'
concert in July 1985 that raised tens of millions of dollars.
Again, the pendulum swung, and the hunger story disappeared from
American television screens.''
   The world produces plenty of food, but it comes mostly from a
relatively few countries, including the United States. Countries
that have the money can afford to buy from the surplus holders. In
the Third World, where money is scarce, hunger can be plentiful.
   Estimates by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) show that in 1985 an estimated 512 million
people suffered from hunger and malnutrition and the effects of
malnutrition in developing countries other than China, an increase
of 37 million from 1980.
   ``Hunger doesn't have much to do with the general availability
of food in the world, it has to do with poverty,'' the Jaenke
report said. ``Poor countries and poor people don't eat well
because they don't have the money.''
   It added: ``The truth is that we will solve world hunger only
with economic growth that puts money in people's pockets and
creates new customers for the world's farmers.''
   Earlier this month, 200 agriculture and development experts met
in another World Food Conference in Brussels, Belgium, to see what
could be done about surpluses building up in the developed nations
while much of the Third World goes hungry.
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda pleaded for an end to
``economic parochialism'' and a greater liberalization of world
trade. He urged the big food producers not to dump surpluses on the
Third World as food aid.
   Instead, he said, self-sufficiency and development should be
nurtured in the Third World.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng called for an end to farm
subsidies as a way of bringing about reform. That view, first
advocated last year, has been attacked frequetly by European
Economic Community leaders.
   Frans Andriessen, the EEC agriculture commissioner, told the
Brussels conference that the U.S. position was ``neither possible
nor desirable'' and that ``some form of stabilization and
protectionism'' will always be needed.
   Lyng said the United States over the last several years has been
shifting to a more market-oriented agricuture ``with a fair degree
of success.''
   Reduced domestic price supports on feed grains, rice and wheat,
and lower target prices across the board have helped discourage
worldwide overproduction and have helped boost U.S. sales, he said.
   ``The disruptive effect on world trade from existing policies
has been damaging to those who can least afford it _ the developing
nations,'' Lyng said. ``Thus, in those countries where agricultural
exports are the main source of revenue, the increased income from
liberalizing trade should stimulate domestic economies.''
   By removing agricultural subsidies, the Third World will have
more to invest in other domestic and export industries, he said.
Domestic income growth would be stimulated and debt burdens can be
eased.

<TEXT>
   Stacy Keach, who portrays Ernest Hemingway in
a new TV miniseries, is working offstage with the famous writer's
granddaughter to combat the abuse of drugs and alcohol.
   Just as Hemingway was known for his boozing, Keach knows a thing
or two about drugs.
   While he was still doing the ``Mike Hammer'' series he was
arrested in April 1984 in England for smuggling 1.3 ounces of
cocaine. He spent six months in prison in late 1985 and early 1986
_ ``the lowest point of my life'' _ and says he has been free of
drugs ever since.
   ``I did an anti-drug film and I'm still very active in the
fight,'' he says. ``I just went to Corpus Christi, Texas, with
Margaux Hemingway to help raise money for a drug and alcohol
program.''
   Miss Hemingway, a 32-year-old model, was treated for alcoholism
at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., in December.
   Keach stars in ``Hemingway,'' a six-hour syndicated miniseries
that will begin playing on stations across the country this weekend.
   He recalls that a few years ago he and a friend were touring
Hemingway's house in Key West and looking at pictures of the Nobel
Prize-winning writer as a young man. ``My friend asked me,
`Something ring a bell?' I said no and he said, `Go look in a
mirror.' So when we got back to that house to film it was like deja
vu.''
   Keach says that three years ago when he was doing `Mike Hammer'
he almost got a Hemingway project off the ground with CBS.
   ``Then I found out Danny Wilson was doing this show and that he
had me in mind for Hemingway. It's the old cliche of being in the
right place at the right time. In a strange way I believe I was
destined to play this part.''
   Hemingway's 16 novels and 49 short stories are still in print
with worldwide sales of more than 1 million copies annually.
Although some of his novels show signs of age, his distinctively
crisp, terse, action-packed style make his short stories and
journalistic pieces seem as relevant and as contemporary as ever.
   ``He was a man who looked for one true sentence,'' Keach says.
``He never used adjectives. He tried to write the way Cezanne
painted. But he was a man who turned on his friends. I think it was
the booze. He helped T.S. Eliot get started. He helped F. Scott
Fitzgerald get back on his feet. But he turned on them.
   ``He was passionate about his work and his family. He was
sensitive, although I hate to use that word because it can be
misconstrued. And when he got loaded he was a difficult person. He
was a terror. I think he felt he had earned the right to live the
way he did. He got up early, wrote, then had breakfast and drank a
bottle of wine.''
   Keach gained 35 pounds for the role, which he is still taking
off. He also grew a beard.
   The story follows Hemingway from 1925, when he became a voice
for the ``Lost Generation,'' through his turbulent romances and
marriages to four women, to the roles he created as hunter, lover,
fighter, adventurer, dreamer, sportsman and soldier-correspondent.
   ``We started filming 10,000 feet up in the Alps, overlooking
Switzerland and Italy at St. Moritz,'' Keach says. ``I had to ski
on the old-fashioned skis with no edges. They're really tough. The
director yelled cut and I just kept going down the mountain.''
   The filming took Keach and the crew to nearly all the places
associated with Hemingway: Venice; Paris; Pamplona, Spain; Africa;
Key West, Fla., and Michigan. They were unable to get into Cuba,
however, and filmed the Havana scenes in Puerto Rico.
   ``At Pamplona, they were supposed to film me before the bulls
ran through the streets,'' he says. ``Then a double was supposed to
run with the bulls. We had a German director, a Spanish crew and
actors of every known nationality. Once the bulls started nobody
had control of anything. I had to run with the bulls and I've never
run faster in my life.''
   Playing Hemingway's four wives are Geraldine Chaplin as Hadley
Richardson, Marisa Berenson as Pauline Pfeiffer, Lisa Banes as
Martha Gelhorn and Pamela Reed as Mary Welsh.
   Keach says he based his portrayal partly on the late director
John Huston, since he was ``the only Hemingwayish character I'd
ever known personally.''
   Besides ``Hemingway,'' Keach recently did a radio dramatization
of ``The Crucible'' for BBC and next will take ``Sleuth'' on a
national stage tour with Maxwell Caulfield as his co-star.
   Although Keach no longer does ``Mike Hammer'' as a series, plans
are under way to make three two-hour movies in the manner of
``Perry Mason.''
   Keach and his brother, Jim, also hope to do a sequel to ``The
Long Riders,'' a film written by Jim Keach that brought together
many of Hollywood's acting brothers, including the Carradines, the
Quaids and the Guests. Keach played Frank James and his brother
portrayed Jesse James.

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His grandson describes David Ben-Gurion,
who was the force behind the founding of Israel and became its
first prime minister, as an inveterate bookworm who often seemed
oblivious to life's realities.
   Yariv Ben-Eliezer, who teaches film and television at Tel Aviv
University, said his grandfather took him to a publishing house
every birthday after he was eight.
   ``He would say, `Choose whatever book you want and as many as
you want.' I ended up with a big box loaded with books, and then he
would sit down and write on each book `From Grandpa' and the
date,'' Ben-Eliezer recalled, showing his interviewer an
inscription from 1951.
   ``I guess this was his way of teaching me to love books. He
never preached or said you ought to read, like we do to our kids,''
said the 48-year-old professor, the eldest of Ben-Gurion's seven
grandchildren and the only one who knew him well.
   Books and politics so consumed Israel's founding father, his
grandson said, that he often seemed unaware of the value of money
and naive about the material needs of his family.
   ``He never carried money with him and he didn't know the value
of money so much because he never cared,'' said Ben-Eliezer, whose
mother was Ben-Gurion's daughter Geula. ``Grandmother care of the
household.''
   Ben-Eliezer mentioned his own wedding, where his grandfather
beckoned him to a corner and whispered conspiratorily: ``So, what
kind of book would you like me to give you for a wedding present?''
   The young man, who was in the army and had very little money,
said he was ``astonished because I didn't need a book. I needed a
stove and a refrigerator.'' He got his grandmother to intervene and
the appliances were forthcoming.
   Ben-Gurion never lost his sense of proportion, Ben-Eliezer said,
making his point with childhood memories of celebrations Nov. 29,
1947, the day the United Nations approved nationhood for Israel.
   ``Everybody went into the streets dancing and singing and he was
alone in his room,'' Ben-Eliezer said. ``My uncle came to him and
said, `Why don't you join the celebrating?' and Ben-Gurion said,
`Because I know what the cost will be.'''
   Ben-Gurion, who died in 1973 at age 87, also had an image of
sternness and most visitors were afraid to waste his time by
telling jokes or exchanging pleasantries.
   ``That's one of the reasons people would say that he wasn't so
friendly, and that he didn't like to associate with people,'' his
grandson said, adding that the opposite was true: ``He would love
to be with young people who didn't have inhibitions and would treat
him like another youngster.''

   American ambulance service is in such a state of
emergency that some cities should set red lights flashing and
sirens wailing, experts say.
   Emergency medical service ``for certainly more than half the
United States ... ranges from deep trouble to critical but
stable,'' said Jack Stout, a Miami consultant who has designed
ambulance systems in six cities.
   ``EMS is some of the nation's largest cities is in critical
condition. Absolutely critical. They're out of control or broken
down,'' said James Page, chief of the Monterey Park, Calif., fire
department, which handles ambulance runs, and publisher of the
Journal of Emergency Medical Services.
   Emergency care has improved dramatically from the 1960s when
broken bodies were simply scooped off the pavement and whisked to
the nearest hospital, without thought to on-site care. Given
today's capabilities, however, deaths from injury and heart attack
are considered unacceptably high.
   Quality and control have fallen off with a drop in federal
money, lack of federal oversight and haphazard training, according
to some critics. Too many systems are plagued by mismanagement,
inefficiency, poor design and simple mistakes.
   One tipoff to a troubled system is access. Less than half the
U.S. population can get an ambulance by dialing 911. Others must
know the exact department or agency to call. Britain has used a 999
number since 1930.
   A properly organized and equipped national EMS system could
prevent 30,000 heart attack deaths and 25,000 deaths by injury each
year, according to estimates by the National Academy of Sciences.
   ``We're killing more of our own citizens in a year than were
killed in all of Vietnam,'' said James Hitlin, a former paramedic
in Florida and a lobbyist for a bill to promote a national EMS
program. ``We're forfeiting lives because of disorganization.''
   A spot check of ambulance service in major cities by The
Associated Press found:
   _In Washington, D.C., a man who suffered a seizure Jan. 17
waited 38 minutes for a lost ambulance. His family finally drove
him to a hospital, where he died. Callers to 911 in the capital
city sometimes get a recorded message. Ambulances routinely take 30
minutes to arrive.
   _In New York City, where 100 ambulances are dispatched every
hour, two paramedics were disciplined for waiting for their
sandwiches in a deli despite a call to help a man dying from a
heart attack less than two blocks away Feb. 17. Last August, a
70-year-old woman died of heart failure after a two-hour wait for
an ambulance and three calls to EMS by friends and relatives.
Officials blamed a dispatching mixup and a shortage of units for
the delay.
   On the other hand:
   _In Tulsa, Okla., a computer knows in an instant the ambulance
nearest an emergency; instead of being parked at a station house,
each vehicle moves around under guidance of the computer, which
calculates when and where accidents and heart attacks are apt to
happen. Radar tracks the ambulance, shown as a magenta blip on a
30-inch electronic screen, so it can't get lost. Ambulances must
respond in 8 minutes 90 percent of the time or the private company
that runs the service is fined.
   _Seattle draws praise for its life-saving rate. Fire department
paramedics revive half the 300 people who suffer heart attacks each
year, giving them a chance to make it to a hospital. About 80 of
those 150 recover completely. Citizens also get involved.
Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation is mandatory in King County schools
and part of health studies in Seattle schools.
   The type of service varies from city to city. Some ambulances
are run by fire departments, others as separate municipal services.
Some cities hire private companies, others rely on hospitals.
Volunteers handle emergencies in 30 percent of the cases
nationwide, but only one of the 150 largest cities has a volunteer
service.
   As recently as the 1960s, most ambulances were operated by
funeral homes because hearses were the only rigs big enough to
carry patients on cots. Care was crude, and rides were
rough-and-tumble.
   ``Those were the days of `You call. We haul. That's all,''' said
John Chew, EMS program director for the U.S. Department of
Transportation.
   The federal government stepped in 22 years ago, telling states
to upgrade emergency services to provide some form of rudimentary
medical care. The Highway Safety Act of 1966 was used to pressure
reluctant states with the threat of forfeited highway money.
   In 1973, the Emergency Medical Act went further, providing $30
million over seven years to establish a nationwide EMS network. But
in 1981, oversight shifted and money got tighter under the Reagan
policy of putting most federal funds into block grants.
   That left the states to decide how to divvy up all Preventive
Health and Health Services money among such programs as ambulances,
rat control and fluoridation.
   EMS allocations dropped 34 percent from 1981 to 1983, according
to the General Accounting Office, which was asked to review the
system by Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of California and Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts.
   State spending has made up some of the difference since but has
not hit previous levels, the GAO said.
   Cranston has sponsored a bill to provide $75 million for EMS and
trauma centers over three years. A similar bill is pending in the
House.
   Ambulance care has evolved on two levels. Basic life support
offers cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, bandages and oxygen provided
by emergency medical technicians. Advanced life support features
highly skilled paramedics who can inject medicine, restart hearts
with electric jolts and clear airways with tubes.
   The country has 400,000 EMTs and 35,171 paramedics. Federal
guidelines suggest 110 hours of training for EMTs, as many as 1,000
hours for paramedics. Only 30 states require certification through
a written and practical test for paramedics given by the National
Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians.
   In some states, paramedics get less schooling than hairstylists.
In Ohio, for example, hairstylists train 1,800 hours for a license;
a paramedic needs only 1,000 hours.
   ``There are very few jobs where somebody's life is in hands that
take less training,'' said William Burns of the national registry.
   To get better performance, some cities have turned to private
companies. Pinellas County, Fla., which includes Tampa and St.
Petersburg, pays Hospital Corporation of America $727,000 a month
for ambulance service.
   ``There's no incentive to be efficient in the public sector,''
said Robert Forbuss, president of the American Ambulance
Association and head of a private ambulance company in Las Vegas,
Nev. ``They're at the mercy of unions and Civil Service. You can't
fire the fire department if it does a bad job.''
   About 65 percent of EMS providers are volunteers, but paid
professionals cover the largest cities and care for 70 percent of
the population, according to the federal government.
   Increasingly, towns are abandoning volunteer systems, due to
demand for more sophisticated care and to fewer people who can
balance the demands of regular jobs with the time needed for
emergency work.
   ``The volunteer system is crumbling. There's no place for
volunteers in a professional service,'' said Patrick Kennedy,
president of a private ambulance company that serves Reading, Pa.
   ``We're not making cookies or putting out fires out here. You
can rebuild a building. You can't rebuild a life.''

   The sick junkie was dying from a bad batch of
heroin. But when paramedic Bill Jones rescued him by injecting an
antidote, he got no thanks for his trouble.
   ``I was saving his life, but he was mad at me for ruining his
high,'' Jones said with a laugh.
   ``But if you can prevent one death from happening that day,
we've accomplished something. When I save a human life, I get a
high you would never believe,'' said Jones, 40, who has also
delivered 27 babies in his 10 years as a Washington, D.C.,
paramedic.
   Paramedics and emergency medical technicians are the front door
of medical care. They are the eyes, ears and arms of doctors. Their
ambulances are emergency rooms on wheels.
   They never know if the next alarm will be a heart attack, car
wreck, shooting, stabbing or cobra bite. Sometimes, it's less
urgent: hemorrhoids, cut fingers, stubbed toes, bleeding moles,
splinters or people who use them as taxis to the hospital.
   ``This is the front line. It's Dodge City. We try to beat the
devil on every call,'' said Calvin Haupt, an emergency medical
technician here.
   ``They see the worst life has to offer as a routine part of
their job,'' said John Cavenagh, director of Washington's Emergency
Ambulance Bureau.
   Not all of it is as heroic as the life portrayed on the old
television show ``Emergency.''
   ``That program glorified everything. No one ever died. I'd never
lose a life either if I could edit the film,'' said Bo Pounds, who
runs the Metro Ambulance Service in Marietta, Ga.
   ``It's a high-risk, high-stress occupation. There's high
burnout, lots of divorce, lots of alcholism, lots of suicide. But
it's exciting work _ the red lights and sirens syndrome,'' said
John Chew, an emergency medical services specialist with the U.S.
Department of Transportation.
   ``EMS is more dangerous than police work, more hazardous than
firemen's work and more stressful than both put together,'' said
Frank Fishburne, president of Local 3721 of the American Federation
of Government Employees in Washington.
   On March 19, two New York paramedics trying to aid a Manhattan
man who'd slashed his left wrist were attacked by three men who
``felt the EMS treatment was not to their satisfaction,'' said
police spokesman John Clifford.
   One paramedic suffered a sprained wrist. The other was cut and
bruised. The three men were charged with second-degree assault.
   Paramedics require about 1,000 hours of training to be
certified. Their pay ranges from $21,000 to $40,000. They
frequently work 24-hour days, and, not surprisingly, they seek the
same esteem given police and firefighters.
   In New York City, paramedics were angered when Mayor Edward Koch
called them ambulance drivers who didn't deserve the same pay as
police and firefighters.
   ``They want to be recognized as legitimate professionals. They
want to be recognized for the risks they take and the lives they
save,'' said Dr. Alexander Kuehl, vice president of the Health and
Hospitals Corporation, the New York agency that runs the ambulance
program.
   ``EMS is a young person's occupation. People are very
enthusiastic at 20. At 40, it's hard to lift a person down 17
flights of stairs,'' Kuehl said. ``They're exposed to physically
taxing work and danger.''
   So why do it?
   ``We do it because we like it,'' said Fred Hurtado, 41, a
paramedic for 15 years in Los Angeles and a former Navy medic.
``You get a special feeling when you know you made a difference and
kept someone from getting their ticket punched.''

   ``The city's traumatized 911 ambulance service has been a
spectacular citywide disaster for longer than anyone cares to
remember.''
   _ Washington Post editorial.

   Blood streamed from Mozone Kelly's mouth and
nose. His frantic family called 911 for an ambulance. They called
again. And again.
   After 38 tortuous minutes, they gave up waiting for an ambulance
that twice drove to wrong locations in a series of blunders Jan.
17. Two brothers wrapped the unconscious Kelly in blankets and
drove him to a hospital. He died an hour after the first call.
   ``It seemed like minutes were hours. I wouldn't feel so bad if
the ambulance had showed up,'' said Anne Glover, Kelly's mother.
   ``I could accept it if my brother was dead on arrival,'' added
Macleta Oliver, ``but I can't accept them saying they were just
lost. I'm outraged at this incompetence.''
   ``Mr. Kelly got caught up in a system that's got too many faults
in it,'' said William Jones, 40, a paramedic and officer of Local
3721 of the American Federation of Government Employees.
   Washington's Emergency Ambulance Bureau is among the nation's
busiest. Last year, it made 142,000 runs in a city of 626,000.
   Critics say it is also among the nation's worst. Some ambulances
take 30 minutes or more to arrive because of disorganization and
lost crews.
   A frustrated Jones called it ``crisis management at its worst.''
Dr. Howard Champion, head of Washington Hospital Center's trauma
unit, said its faults were ``an institutionalized litany of
incompetence.'' Dr. Joy Drass, a colleague, called it ``a national
disgrace.''
   Some items:
   Dispatching _ Callers to 911 at peak times sometimes get a taped
message advising them to wait for the operator. ``It's kind of hard
when a recording is telling you to hold the line when your husband
is holding his chest and turning blue,'' Jones said.
   Last March, a dispatcher was fired for telling a man whose
stepmother was dying of heart failure, ``Hey, hey, grow up.''
Paramedics did not arrive until 27 minutes after the first of three
calls.
   Training _ In June, an entire class of 14 emergency medical
technicians failed a national certification test. Until this year,
medical technicians were given two hours of map training on city
streets. It's now 40 hours.
   Management _ Fifteen directors have headed the service since
1974, including one for two hours on a Friday afternoon. ``We are
forever changing heads and never getting to the problem,'' said
Frank Fishburne, president of the paramedics' union.
   In February, Mayor Marion Barry stripped control of the
ambulance bureau from the fire department and placed it under the
city administrator. The shakeup came after the mayor's committee
overseeing city emergency services voted 5-4 it had no confidence
in Fire Chief Theodore Coleman's management.
   The system should be junked, according to critics such as Robert
Forbuss, president of the American Ambulance Association, an
industry group for private ambulance services.
   ``You just need to start over. It's flawed beyond fixing until
they have a major overhaul,'' said Forbuss. ``I don't care if
Superman is running it. It's clear they have no idea what they're
doing.''
   John Cavenagh, former EMS director in Philadelphia, was hired in
October to run Washington's system and has a 2{-year plan to turn
it around.
   ``The elements of an excellent system are all here. It remains
only to assemble those elements into a cohesive system,'' he said.
   Cavenagh maintains that help is on the way, though not as much
as he'd like.
   The bureau's budget this year was increased from $9.4 million to
$12.8 million, but that was $2.2 million less than requested. The
city has 33 paramedics. Cavenaugh will hire 32 more, although he
wanted 65 new posts.
   He called Mozone Kelly's death ``an isolated incident _ a very
unfortunate, but isolated, incident.''
   In that episode, the family called three times from 9 to 9:10
a.m. after Kelly had a seizure.
   The dispatcher gave an inexact address, and firefighters advised
the departing ambulance crew to try a location two miles from
Kelly's home. They twice drove to wrong locations.
   What should have been an eight-minute trip took 38 minutes.
Kelly, 38, the father of two, was already on his way to the
hospital in his brothers car.
   One of the crew was later suspended for 10 days; the other for
five.

   A 70-year-old woman died of heart failure while
waiting two hours for an ambulance summoned in three frantic phone
calls from relatives and friends.
   The delay last August was blamed on a dispatching mixup and a
shortage of units in a system that handles 100 emergency calls
every hour.
   ``New York City's response time kills people. It's a killer, a
genuine, true-bred killer,'' said Robert Forbuss of Las Vegas,
Nev., who runs a private ambulance company and is president of the
American Ambulance Association, an organization of private
emergency services.
   But New York is not alone in needing to improve on a job where
minutes are critical.
   A spot survey by The Associated Press of response times showed a
range from an average 3.5 minutes in Milwaukee and 4 minutes in
Seattle to 10.4 minutes in Detroit and 13.56 minutes in New York
last year.
   Critics say the averages are misleading. Some are measured from
the time the call is made to when the ambulance arrives. Others
count it from when the unit rolls, discounting the time a
dispatcher takes to screen a call.
   An ambulance should be on the scene in 8 minutes, experts say.
   ``If a 10-minute response time is the best you can do, why
bother to show up?'' said James Page, publisher of the Journal of
Emergency Medical Services.
   Time is essential because a stopped heart can be restarted by
electric jolt within 4 to 6 minutes. When a person stops breathing,
lack of oxygen damages the brain in 4 to 6 minutes. A trauma
patient can bleed to death if help is late.
   Here are capsule looks at three troubled ambulance systems:
   _ New York's response times have improved. The city upgraded its
dispatching system and separated life-threatening calls from
non-emergency ones, saying the critical calls are answered in less
than 6 minutes 40 percent of the time. The time starts when the
unit leaves, not when the call comes in.
   ``It's improved. But there are too many individual cases where
people wait an inordinately long time,'' said Saul Stern, spokesman
for City Council President Andrew Stein, a critic of the service.
   In July, an ambulance took 60 minutes to answer U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani's plea for help for a friend suffering chest pains.
   ``Unless I were reassured that this problem has been cured, I
would seriously consider getting a taxi or my car and going right
to the hospital,'' Giuliani said.
   In February, two paramedics were disciplined for waiting for
their sandwiches in a deli despite a call about a heart attack two
blocks away. The man died.
   ``That's just two stupid idiots,'' said Bo Pounds, who runs the
Metro Ambulance Service in Marietta, Ga. ``If two guys worked for
me and they were eating sandwiches, I wouldn't discipline them _
I'd fire them. You don't need breaks when people are out here
dying.''
   _ Detroit has also improved. The average dipped from 10.4
minutes to 8.6 minutes this year. Six extra ambulances were
deployed at peak times and one 24-hour ambulance was added.
   ``Response times were horrendous. They were inhumane. Compared
to what we were, we've improved 90 to 100 percent,'' said Jeff
White of Michigan Ambulance, one of six private companies that
handle overflow calls when city crews are busy.
   Detroit's $9 million-a-year ambulance service has just one
full-time advanced life support unit for 1.1 million people. A
second unit is available 12 hours a day, and the city has 19 units
offering a lower level of care.
   ``For $9 million of taxpayers' money, you get absolutely
nothing, except maybe a happy union,'' said Jack Stout, a Miami
consultant who has designed ambulance services in six cities.
   _ In Broward County, Fla., officials plan to take over a system
run by three private companies who serve 60 percent of the county
around Fort Lauderdale. The reason: slow response.
   The companies breach a 10-minute response limit 30 percent of
the time, according to Broward's emergency services division. The
$8 million takeover will replace the companies in three stages,
ousting the slowest company first.
   Broward emergencies are handled by a two-level system. County
paramedics treat patients at the scene while private ambulances
ferry them to hospitals.
   In one recent case, the daughter of an anesthesiologist from
Broward General Hospital had a heart attack at home. Her father
worked to revive her until paramedics arrived.
   The ambulance took 34 minutes to get there. By then, the woman
was dead.
   ``They got lost,'' said Pierce Adams, spokesman for the county
paramedics.

   Behind the stern granite face of the Allegheny
County Courthouse and Jail, Kate Soffel whispered her
turn-of-the-century scheme of passion and escape with the
imprisoned Biddle boys.
   More than eight decades later, and four years after the movie
``Mrs. Soffel,'' her courthouse on Sunday marks 100 years since
completion, the last major work by Henry Hobson Richardson, who
helped shape American architecture.
   ``You know a Richardson building when you see it, either that or
a copy of one,'' said George White, current architect of the U.S.
Capitol.
   Richardson was said to be aiming for ``a dignified pile of
rocks.'' The result was the fortress-like, block-long courthouse
and jail, joined by a great stone walkway over Ross Street that is
still known by grim-faced prisoners and passers-by as ``The Bridge
of Sighs.''
   Other famous Richardson works include Trinity Church in Boston,
Marshall Field Wholesale Store in Chicago, City Hall in Albany,
N.Y., and Town Hall in North Easton, Mass.
   Many late 19th century buildings imitate Richardson's revival of
the medievel European Roman style that came to be known as
Richardsonian Romanesque.
   Architect Frank Lloyd Wright was said to be enchanted by the
courthouse, calling it ``worth all the other buildings in
Pittsburgh put together.''
   It might have been. Pittsburghers of the 1880s were horrified by
Richardson's extravagant plans and the $2.3 million pricetag.
   Expensive 8-foot-long granite slabs used to build the arches
were displayed on street corners by critics, according to James W.
Knox, a county planning director who has worked in the courthouse
for 42 years.
   ``They said the halls were too big, the courtroom ceilings were
too high,'' Knox said.
   But Pittsburgh led the nation in iron work and steelmaking, and
officials wanted a grand courthouse to serve the growing city.
   And yet, after being selected from about 100 American
architects, Richardson died a year before the building was
completed. ``Let me but have time to finish Pittsburgh and I should
be content without another day,'' he supposedly lamented in his
last days.
   In January 1901, Mrs. Soffel, the wife of the jail's warden,
engineered the escape of handsome Jack and Ed Biddle, who were
awaiting the hangman for murder.
   With them, she fled about 30 miles north before police shot the
men down. Mrs. Soffel was wounded and recovered to serve two years
in prison.
   Diane Keaton and Mel Gibson acted out the torrid tale in the
movie. Producers returned to the original setting, closed down Ross
Street, hauled in mud to cover asphalt and concrete, and sprinkled
manmade snow on stone in the summer sun.
   Today, what had been Mrs. Soffel's bedroom is jail Administrator
Ed Urban's office. Only the homey fireplace hints that the room
once served as living quarters.
   ``This place has an amazing history,'' said Urban, who has
collected old photos, records and letters detailing a century of
life and death in the jail.
   One record notes that a few years after Mrs. Soffel went astray,
William J. Byers was being hanged for murder on a wooden scaffold
in the courtyard when the noose slipped and he fell 10 feet to the
ground. Cold water brought him back to decidedly unheavenly
surroundings.
   ``Where am I? I can't be dead. I seem to be living,'' the record
quotes Byers as saying. A few minutes later, he was hanged
efficiently.
   Today, guards still carry heavy brass rings with keys that have
locked the jail's 620 cells since Richardson's time.
   Across the street, the courthouse's 325-foot tower houses a
183-bell carillon, and the smaller towers, as Richardson had
planned, store official records.
   ``He's the first really creative American architect who created
an architectural idiom that then became not only national in style,
but international,'' said William H. Pierson, an architectural
historian and author in Williamstown, Mass.
   ``His great genius as an architect was that he was able to solve
very practical problems and at the same time give those buildings a
very powerful, evocative, romantic expression,'' said Richard
Cleary, an architectural historian at Carnegie Mellon University.
   The interior of the courthouse and jail has changed much since
Richardson's day. The original 27-foot courtroom ceilings, for
example, have been dropped to 12 feet.
   More than 1,000 people work in the courthouse. The corridors
often are crowded and the cranky elevator breaks down periodically,
but county clerk Donald Glunt says no one minds much.
   ``I've never heard anybody say, `Oh, this building is so old or
the ceilings are too high,''' he said.
   ``You really feel that this is the people's courthouse, and
there is nothing like it anywhere else,'' Knox said.

   The state of Iowa has widened its assault on the
powerful banking industry by challenging whether Goliath-sized
Citibank can bypass all state consumer laws when issuing credit
cards.
   Bankers and some lawyers maintained Tuesday that Iowa doesn't
have a legal leg to stand on, and that the Supreme Court already
addressed the question a decade ago in dealing with interest-rate
caps.
   But consumer groups and some analysts warn the credit-card
pricing structure could be thrown into turmoil should Iowa win its
case.

banks pay.
   As part of a program to rebuild the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which backs deposits up to $100,000, S&Ls have

   A stronger dollar, weakening interest rates and a wave of
computerized program trading has pushed the stock market to its
highest levels since the October market crash.
   A late rally sparked by program trading sent the Dow Jones
industrial average up 14.09 to 2,110.08, its first close over 2,100
since the Oct. 19 crash. The rise brought the widely-followed
index's gain over the past six sessions to about 130 points.
   Stocks rallied even though oil prices broke the $18-a-barrel
barrier for the first time in four months, a possible harbinger of
higher inflation. Oil was pushed higher by rumors of a Panama
pipeline shutoff and OPEC's moves to reduce supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May delivery
of West Texas Intermediate crude, which jumped $1.01 a barrel
Monday, rose another 20 cents to close at $18.09.
   Analysts noted the Dow average had flirted with the
psychological 2,100 barrier in several recent sessions, but on
Tuesday investors did not back away once the key market barometer
held above that level in mid-afternoon.
   Stock prices were mixed earlier in the session, and the market
appeared to lack direction.
   Analysts noted that volume remained extremely light, initially
indicating a lack of investor enthusiasm but then serving to
accentuate the move upward once buyers did step in.

   A two-day surge in oil prices has pushed crude
over the $18-a-barrel barrier for the first time since December,
although so far the rally has relied largely on words from OPEC.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May delivery
of West Texas Intermediate crude, which jumped $1.01 a barrel
Monday, advanced another 20 cents Tuesday to settle at $18.09.
   It was the first time oil for the near-month contract closed
over $18 since the Dec. 11 close of $18.31.
   Prices also rose strongly the second consecutive day among
refined products traded on the exchange. Wholesale heating oil rose
1.03 cents a gallon to close at 48.91 cents, and wholesale unleaded
gasoline rose 1.12 cents a gallon to close at 52.07 cents.
   ``It's just a perception change about what OPEC is saying and
doing,'' said Richard Redoglia, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures in New York. ``The perception has waned back and forth
because usually any statement they make is discounted. But the
market heard something we haven't heard before.''
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said it had
invited eight non-OPEC exporters to a meeting April 23 to discuss
coordinated strategies for reducing output and forcing prices up.
News of the meeting Monday was a key reason for the market's rally.
   The carryover in Tuesday's trading was aided by a report that
Norway, an important non-OPEC producer that wasn't among the eight
exporters invited to the meeting, would send an observer. The
report by Norway's national news agency added to the possible
significance of the meeting, traders said.
   Prices also advanced on rumors, apparently unfounded, that a
crucial trans-Panama oil pipeline would shut down. The rumors
stemmed from an incident at a U.S. military base in the troubled
Central American nation in which a Marine guard patrolling a
petroleum storage area was shot dead.
   ``The market is sensitive to anything to do with anything and
nothing to do with supply and demand. That's exactly what's going
on,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of Elders Energy
Futures Inc. in New York.
   Some market experts have detected what they call a profound
shift in the oil market because of OPEC's effort to stem an erosion
in prices. Others say the fractious 13-nation cartel historically
has failed to maintain pricing discipline and the latest effort
likely will collapse.

   In the old days, maple sugaring consisted
mainly of a grove of sugar maples, buckets, horse-drawn sleighs to
collect them and a wood fire to boil down the collected sap.
   These days on David Marvin's maple farm, sugaring means purple
plastic tubing, vacuum pumps and a reverse osmosis unit.
   This is high-tech maple sugaring _ maybe not as romantic as a
bucket on a tree, but much more common.
   ``There are more and more people who are using the advanced
technology all the time,'' said Everett Willard, maple marketing
specialist for the Vermont Department of Agriculture. He estimates
75 percent of this year's sap will be sucked out through plastic
tubing instead of dripping into a bucket.
   Stretching through Marvin's sugarbush _ the grove of sugar
maples _ are miles of green plastic tubing attached to a vacuum
pump, two vats and an underground piping system. In the sugarhouse,
a reverse osmosis unit concentrates the sap before it's boiled in a
V-shaped vat with steam-heated copper tubing.
   ``Last year there were counties in the state that did not have a
reverse osmosis unit. I don't know if that's true now,'' added
Sumner Williams, a research technician at the University of Vermont
maple research center in Underhill.
   The machinery is in use right now as sugar makers ply their
trade in the waning days of the sugaring season. They're expecting
a good year _ although uncooperative weather could curb the sap
output _ that will surpass last year's production of 275,000
gallons, although they don't expect to top the 338,000 gallons
produced in 1986.
   The record production was nearly 1.63 million gallons in 1927.
   Runs in the south are looking good so far. There are loads of
sap, and it has been making good-tasting syrup, too.
   ``Yesterday morning I called five producers in five Vermont
towns, and every one of them told me they made more than last
year,'' Everett said recently.
   Up north, where Marvin taps, sugar makers had a slow start.
Producers need warm days and chilly nights for the sap to flow, but
even a daytime high of 40 degrees wasn't coaxing the clear liquid
from the trees during a late March trip through Marvin's sugarbush.
   The runs improved a few days later. Perfect sugaring weather
sent a flood of sap from the trees, and producers were boiling for
hours on end. But the good luck lasted just a few days, and as
temperatures rose it looked like production wouldn't be much better
than the yield in 1986.
   In Marvin's sugarbush, sap tubing _ which is often green or
purple _ stretches like a psychedelic clothesline as it's strung
from tree to tree. The lines are attached to the vacuum, which
helps suck sap from the tubes. The sap is stored in the two large
vats, which are piped to the sugarhouse.
   The reverse osmosis machine pushes the sap through membranes so
that the relative sugar content increases from about 2 percent to 8
percent. That means less water in the sap, and a lot less boiling
time to turn it into syrup.
   Such innovations have grown more common as more people take up
sugaring, a trade once dominated by dairy farmers. Willard
estimates the number of tree taps has at least doubled in the last
10 years.
   Vermont's maple research center runs a sugarmaking operation and
passes on production tips through meetings and publications.
   Marvin, whose father Jim co-founded the center, has tried to
keep up with the latest technology, from new machinery to better
trees. One researcher, Dr. Mariafranca Morselli, is doing
laboratory tests on tree varieties.
   ``I don't foresee my planting trees that come from a test tube.
However, there is a great deal of practical application to what
she's doing and others have been doing before. She's really looking
at the importance of genetic traits in sap production and yield and
so forth,'' said Marvin.
   Marvin sees this year as a watershed in the trend toward
high-tech sugaring.
   ``If we have a good year, I see people making capital
improvements, whether it's a vacuum system or an evaporator,'' he
said. ``However, if it's a poor year, I think people are going to
be discouraged.
   ``My hope is we have just an average year,'' he said, ``and
there won't be so much maple syrup that it floods the market.''

<TEXT>
   Seeking greater operating efficiency,
Westinghouse Electric Corp. and the Swiss firm ABB Asea Brown
Boveri plan joint ventures in their multibillion-dollar electric
generation, transmission and distribution businesses.
   ``With the entrenched fixed costs and relative slow rate of
growth in those industries, a partnership is the way to go,'' said
Julian Manear, an analyst in Chicago for Pershing & Co. ``There's a
sharing of resources, so you don't have a duplication.''
   The two companies announced Tuesday that they had signed a
memorandum of understanding to proceed.
   Westinghouse will have a 55 percent interest and ABB a 45
percent interest in each of two partnerships. ABB also will pay
Westinghouse about $500 million.
   One partnership will make, sell and service steam turbines and
generators for U.S. and Canadian utilities. The businesses have
current annual sales of about $700 million and employ about 5,000
people.
   ``Generally, joint venturing is considered an alternative to
divesting,'' said H.P. Smith of Smith Barney in New York. ``They
take a business, cut it back as far as they can, then if it's still
not meeting the goals, they consider'' selling it or finding a
partner.
   Westinghouse's turbine business ``hasn't earned a lot of money
for quite a number of years now. The market is depressed and will
stay depressed,'' Smith said.
   The other partnership will involve transmission and distribution
products, including transformers, meters, controls, and switchgear,
now sold in the United States and Canada. The businesses have
annual sales of about $1.4 billion and employ about 11,000 people.
   The partnership allows ABB to buy the transmission and
distribution joint venture or Westinghouse to force the sale in
1990.
   Smith said Westinghouse improved its transmission and
distribution equipment business ``to a point where it was making OK
money, but still well below the corporate goals.''
   In both cases, the partners will combine plants and engineering
and marketing organizations in fully developed industries that show
reduced growth potential.
   Manear said he does not expect wholesale employee layoffs or
plant closings, but foresees delays in capital spending.
   John C. Marous, who became chairman and chief executive of
Westinghouse in January, recently told securities analysts the
company's goals for 1988 include sales growth of 8.5 percent and
operating profit margins of at least 10 percent.
   Westinghouse recently announced joint ventures in factory
automation with the West German electrical equipment giant Siemens
A.G.
   Smith said the joint ventures under Marous ``are showing this
new administration is not going to sit back and rest on the
laurels'' of Westinghouse.
   ABB, headquartered in Zurich, was created Jan. 1 with the merger
of Asea AB of Sweden and BBC Brown Boveri Ltd. of Switzerland. With
sales of $18 billion and 180,000 employees worldwide, the company
is one of the world leaders in electrical engineering.
   Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh, had 1987 sales of $10.7
billion in electrical equipment, defense electronics, broadcasting
and other businesses. The company employs about 110,000 workers.

<HEAD>Stocks Rally to Highest Point Since Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computerized program trading, a strategy blamed
by some analysts for worsening the 1987 stock market collapse, has
helped push the market to its highest level since the October crash.
   A late buying surge boosted the Dow Jones industrial average up
14.09 points to 2,110.08 on Tuesday, its first close above 2,100
since the market crashed on Oct. 19. The gain was the sixth
consecutive rise for a total increase of nearly 130 points in the
widely-followed market index.
   After lackluster early trading, a late-session flurry of program
trading triggered a surge of stock buying that rallied the market.
Such computerized trading programs seek to profit from price
disparities between stock index futures and the stocks represented
by the indexes.
   Trading volume remained light, which accentuated the move upward
once buyers did step in.
   Stocks also were helped by the dollar's strength in foreign
exchange and by declining interest rates in the bond market,
analysts said.
   Analysts said many investors are limiting their activity while
awaiting fresh economic data, such as the government's report on
the U.S. trade deficit for February, which is due out Thursday.

<HEAD>Iowa's Credit Card Suit Puts David Up Against Goliath</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If successful, Iowa's underdog challenge to
Citibank's practice of bypassing that state's consumer credit laws
could wreak havoc on the credit card industry's pricing structure,
say some consumer groups and analysts.
   ``Iowa is challenging banks where they've thus far been
unchallenged,'' said Elgie Holstein, director of the Washington,
D.C.-based consumer group Bankcard Holders of America. ``It's
revisiting the whole issue.''
   But bankers and some lawyers maintained Tuesday that Iowa
doesn't have a legal leg to stand on, and that the Supreme Court
already addressed the question a decade ago in dealing with
interest-rate caps.
   The state filed a federal lawsuit against Citibank on Monday in
an attempt to force it to obey Iowa consumer credit laws when
issuing credit cards to Iowa consumers.
   Citibank maintains that the more lenient laws of South Dakota,
where its credit card operation is based, apply to its cards
wherever they are issued.
   In December 1978, in the case of Marquette National Bank vs.
First Omaha Services Corp., the Supreme Court ruled that nationally
chartered banks could export their home-state interest rates to
credit card customers in other states. The court also barred states
from regulating fees materially related to interest rates charges.
   Congress passed a law granting similar immunity to
state-chartered banks in the early 1980s.
   But whether banks also can set all card fees, such as late
charges, in excess of levels permitted by state laws is at issue in
Iowa's suit.
   ``This is where we get into interpretation,'' said Anita
Boomstein, a banking expert and partner in the Boston law firm
Gaston & Snow.
   She said the banking industry probably would prevail in Iowa's
federal lawsuits, filed Monday against Citibank and three months
ago against First National Bank of Wilmington in Delaware.
   ``There has been no definite case law defining what's `material'
of the rates,'' she said.
   ``I think banks are in a good position, that all of the
financial outlook (including the fees) is in determination of
interest rates.''
   The American Bankers Association expresses the same position,
contending the individual states interfere with banking competition
by regulating credit card rates and fees.
   William McGuire, a spokeman for Citibank, the nation's biggest
credit card issuer and the flagship of the largest U.S. bank
holding company, has refused to comment on the case except to say
that the bank was following federal laws.
   Even Holstein concedes Iowa's suits are ``based upon a narrow
interpretation of the Marquette decision,'' but he commended the
state for taking such an unprecedented stand while others have
ignored the issue.
   ``It was a lawsuit just waiting to happen,'' he said.
   Citicorp and First National Bank of Wilmington aren't the only
two banks whose credit card fees and charges have surpassed the
levels permitted by some state laws.
   Connecticut imposed a 15 percent limit on interest rates charged
by local and out-of-state credit card companies during 1987, taking
the strongest action to regulate consumer credit practices. Eleven
other states also passed laws regulating consumer-oriented aspects
of the credit card industry last year.
   But enforcing those laws has been a different story. To get
around them, banks need only base their credit card operations in
states that have less stringent regulations and usury laws, like
Delaware and South Dakota, said Holstein.
   Iowa is seeking to stop Citibank and First National Bank of
Wilmington from applying the laws of South Dakota and Delaware,
respectively, regarding to late payment fees and insufficient check
charges. Iowa says other companies may be sued as well.
   ``If they (Iowa) were to win, Citibank may just decide not to
issue cards in Iowa,'' which only has 36,000 Citibank MaserCard and
Visa cards anyway, said Stephen Berman, a banking analyst with
County Securities USA.
   But he conceded that should other, larger states take similar
action, banks and their pricing structure could face some big
problems.

<HEAD>Investors Take News Of AT&T Chairman's Illness In Stride</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors reacted calmly to news that AT&T
Chairman James E. Olson has undergone surgery for colon cancer and
will be absent from day-to-day management for an indefinite period.
   Analysts said Olson's forceful style of management has set the
company moving in the right direction, although some were concerned
that an extended absence could be harmful.
   AT&T confirmed newspaper reports Tuesday that Olson, 62,
underwent surgery March 25 to remove a malignant tumor from his
colon and was recuperating at his New Jersey home while receiving
outpatient chemotherapy.
   AT&T's stock rose 25 cents a share to $28.12{ in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Fulton Holmes, an analyst at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.,
said he was more pessimistic than other observers about AT&T's
prospects without Olson at the helm.
   ``He has essentially single-handedly turned this company
around,'' Holmes said. ``I have major reservations about this
company if he ends up having to either lessen his input or turn it
over totally to his successor.''
   AT&T said it could not predict when Olson would return to active
duty or whether he would attend the company's annual meeting in
Denver next Wednesday.
   Robert E. Allen, 52, the president and chief operating officer,
is running the company in his absence.
   Olson has made AT&T more aggressive, more cost-conscious and
more certain of its direction since taking office in September
1986, analysts said.
   Olson landed his first job in the Bell System at age 17,
cleaning silt out of manholes in North Dakota, and is considered a
take-charge executive with an emphasis on getting results.
   ``I think Olson's personality has begun to permeate throughout
AT&T's organization,'' said Jack Grubman, an analyst for
PaineWebber Inc.
   Olson's undisclosed illness was reminiscent of that of William
McGowan, the chairman of MCI Communications Corp., who suffered a
heart attack in December 1986, received a heart transplant and
returned to office in September 1987.
   Both companies drew criticism for failing to announce their
chiefs' illnesses until news leaked out to the press.
   The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported Olson was
ill in their Tuesday editions.
   AT&T spokesman Bill Mullane, who confirmed Olson's illness when
asked about the reports, said lawyers assured him the matter did
not need to be disclosed because it was not considered ``material''
under the law.
   Mullane said Olson has kept up some correspondence from his home
and would be available in case of a crisis.
   ``If there was a critical issue that had to be discussed with
him today, it would be discussed with him just as if he were in
Fiji on vacation,'' Mullane said.
   Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman Chiles Larson said
the illness of a chief executive is not specified as a matter that
automatically requires disclosure. He declined to comment Tuesday
on whether the SEC was investigating the appropriateness of AT&T's
actions.
   The absence of Olson is less significant to AT&T than McGowan's
absence was to MCI, the distant second-place contender in the
long-distance communications market, said Daniel Rosenbaum,
executive editor of Wiretap, a Morristown, N.J.-based newsletter.
   ``AT&T is a much more mature company. It has executives in place
who can pick up the slack,'' Rosenbaum said.

   The United Auto Workers union has blasted Ford
Motor Co. as having ``greedy, short-sighted instincts'' for
awarding nearly $248 million in bonuses to its executives for 1987.
   Vice Chairman Harold Poling was Ford's top earner for 1987 with
compensation of $10.8 million, including $8,060,272 from exercise
of stock options, cash bonuses of $2 million plus salary and
benefits totaling $808,697, according to a proxy statement mailed
Tuesday to Ford shareholders.
   Ford Chairman Donald Petersen received the largest cash bonus
for 1987 _ $2.8 million _ in addition to $929,934 in salary and
benefits, Ford disclosed.
   Ford said it awarded $247.9 million in cash bonuses to 5,166
executives, or an average of nearly $48,000 each. Ford will
distribute half of each bonus Friday and half in January unless an
executive has the payments deferred.
   In 1986, Ford awarded 5,528 executives $164.3 million in bonuses.
   Petersen said that while the increase in bonuses appeared to be
large, the nation's second-largest automaker believed they were
warranted by the company's record profits in 1987.
   But in a written statement, United Auto Workers union President
Owen Bieber and Vice President Stephen P. Yokich, who directs the
union's Ford department, said the bonuses ``send the wrong message
to workers and consumers.''
   ``When it comes to executive compensation, Ford's behavior shows
the same greedy, shortsighted instincts that almost all American
corporations exhibit,'' they stated.
   ``We just don't believe that Mr. Petersen or anyone else is
worth over 100 times as much as a UAW production worker is worth to
Ford.''
   Ford earned a company record $4.6 billion last year, boosting
its 1986 earnings by 41 percent and out-performing industry-leader
General Motors Corp. for the second consecutive year.
   Last month, Ford distributed profit-sharing checks amounting to
a record $636 million to more than 156,000 hourly and salaried
workers in the United States, making for an average check of just
more than $4,000 each.
   GM announced Feb. 9 that although its profits rose 20.6 percent
to $3.56 billion in 1987, it earned too little on its U.S.
automaking business to trigger profit-sharing payments to workers.
   But GM said it would give stock valued at $184.6 million to
about 5,000 of its top executives.
   Chrysler Corp., the nation's third-largest car maker, is
expected to issue its proxy statement next week. Chrysler, which
does not have a profit-sharing plan in its union contract, posted a
7.1 percent decline in its 1987 profit, to $1.29 billion.
   Petersen, Poling and 42 other Ford executives received cash
bonuses totaling $29.9 million for 1987 in addition to salaries and
benefits amounting to $12.9 million. That compares with 45 top
executives receiving $19.5 million in bonuses and $11.3 million in
salaries and benefits in 1986.
   In 1986, Petersen received a $1.3 million cash bonus in addition
to $660,772 in salary and benefits. Poling got a $1.1 million bonus
and earned $531,327 in salary and benefits.
   The proxy statement was issued in advance of Ford's May 12
annual meeting in Detroit.

<TEXT>
   A National Association of Securities Dealers
task force is urging the federal government to impose rules for
brokerage firms that would help thwart illegal insider trading.
   In a report on Tuesday, the NASD Regulatory Review Task Force
said many brokerage firms already had so-called Chinese wall
procedures designed to keep sensitive information from leaking from
a firm's mergers and acquisition staff to its trading staff.
   But the report said neither the Securities and Exchange
Commission nor self-regulatory organizations such as the NASD,
which operates the over-the-counter stock market, have established
standards for Chinese wall procedures.
   Regulators must do a better job of making sure the information
barriers are effective, said the task force, which began work a
year ago and was headed by A.A. Sommer Jr., a securities lawyer and
former SEC commissioner.
   It also recommended:
   _requiring firms to more expeditiously announce news that could
affect the price of their stocks, thus cutting down on the
opportunity for illicit trading.
   _improving NASD computer programs designed to detect unusual
stock trading.
   _abolishing limits on NASD fines for insider trading.
   _making disciplinary records of brokers more readily available
to the public.
   _passing legislation making it easier to restrict re-entry into
the securities business of brokers found guilty of serious
misconduct.

   The state-owned Aeromexico airline cancelled
270 flights Tuesday after 7,500 airline ground crew workers struck
to protest the planned sale of 13 aircraft and anticipated firings
of workers by the troubled carrier.
   Aeromexico's 43 aircraft were grounded in airports in Mexico and
abroad after unionized ground workers walked off their jobs at 2:00
p.m. EDT, said Enrique Gutierrez Ortega, spokesman for the Aeronave
de Mexico parent company.
   Gutierrez Ortega estimated during a telephone interview that
revenue losses would amount to more than $2 million for each day of
the strike.
   The strikers, members of the Aeromexico National Technical
Workers Union, were demanding a halt to company plans to sell 13
aircraft and lay off an unspecified number of airline workers to
cut operating losses.
   Some 17,000 airline passengers had their flights cancelled
because of the walkout, Gutierrez Ortega said.
   ``The passengers most affected are those who had flights to New
York and Paris'' and were unable to quickly arrange alternative
connections, he said.
   Union spokesman Rene Arce told The Associated Press the strike
would continue ``indefinitely as long as the company doesn't revoke
its decision to sell the planes and terminate union workers.''
   Aeromexico officials were appealing to the federal Conciliation
and Arbitration Commission to declare the strike illegal, Gutierrez
Ortega said.
   The government did not plan to take over the nation's
second-largest airline to keep it operating, the Communications and
Transportation Department said in a statement released Tuesday.

<HEAD>Bonus Package For Allegis Chairman Worth Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Allegis Corp. Chairman Stephen M. Wolf has a
contract paying $575,000 a year and a bonus worth more than $6.5
million to replace stock options he formerly held at Tiger
International Inc., documents show.
   According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the bonus is part of the Allegis stock plan offered to
Wolf when he was hired in December from Tiger, where he had served
as chairman and chief executive officer.
   Allegis, the parent company of United Airlines, plans to change
its name next month back to UAL Inc., after recently shedding its
hotel and rental car businesses.
   Under the stock plan, Wolf has the right after Aug. 8 to be paid
the difference between the market price of the 590,000 Tiger shares
he had options on and a base price of $3.32 a share.
   Tiger stock closed Tuesday at $14.75 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange, making the deal worth $6.7 million currently.
   Allegis, the SEC filing says, ``recognizes that its compensation
of (Wolf) must take into account at least a portion of the value''
of his former Tiger stock options.
   Besides the salary and bonus, Wolf is entitled to another annual
bonus, an option to purchase 250,000 shares of Allegis stock and
retirement benefits that give him credit for 22 years of service,
the SEC filing says.
   When asked Tuesday about the contract and any possible labor
friction because of its price tag, Allegis spokesman Joe Hopkins
declined to comment other than to confirm that the deal had been
made.
   Allegis is currently in contract negotiations with its flight
attendants, who already have rejected the company's request for
concessions in exchange for a 4 percent wage increase over 42
months.
   Pat Friend, chairwoman of the United branch of the Association
of Flight Attendants, was in negotiations Tuesday and didn't return
phone calls requesting comment.
   But F.C. Dubinsky, chairman of the United pilots union, said the
size of Wolf's contract wasn't a surprise.
   ``We've always found it curious that management can always
justify reducing costs everywhere but their own wallets,'' he told
the Wall Street Journal.

   A man whose business was seized for a day
by tax collectors after he refused to pay a $4 late fee will get a
refund and an apology from city officials.
   Refunds and similar apologies will also be issued to 13 other
Wyoming businesses penalized for failing to meet a personal
property tax deadline that fell on a holiday weekend in February.
   Roger Wilson paid his taxes but refused to pay the late fee, and
his business was shut down by authorities March 17. The next day,
Wilson paid the fee and reopened his business.
   Wilson said he was pleased to hear about the refund, but even
happier that the city council is considering a measure that would
establish new policies restricting the treasurer's authority to
seize property.
   ``It's scary when a person like that has the authority to
mobilize a police force to take her point of view to the limit,''
Wilson said.
   City Treasurer Anne Porritt declined to comment on the matter.

   Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum
Corp., today signed an agreement with the Soviet government on a
joint project to build a pair of plastics factories worth as much
as $200 million in the Ukraine.
   Hammer said the two plants, which are expected to begin
operating in 1991, would help improve the supply of consumer goods
to the Soviet public.
   ``If socialism is to succeed in Russia, you must improve the
standard of living of your people,'' Hammer told Alexander
Ustkachkinzev, first deputy minister of the Soviet Chemical
Industry, after signing the agreement.
   Hammer, who has had business dealings with the Soviet Union
since the 1920s, told a news conference he is convinced the Soviet
Union ``is committed to making joint ventures succeed.''
   U.S. Commerce Secretary C. William Verity and a group of 400
American business leaders are in Moscow this week for meetings with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials on expanding
trade relations.
   The Soviets are actively seeking joint business projects with
capitalist countries in an attempt to revive their stagnant economy
with more and better quality products.
   There are few joint Soviet-U.S. business ventures. But on
Monday, Honeywell Inc. announced a joint venture to supply
automated production controls for Soviet fertilizer factories, and
on Tuesday Roma Food Enterprises of Piscataway, N.J., began selling
pizza in Moscow from a mobile van.
   In addition, seven major U.S. companies today announced they had
formed the American Trade Consortium, an umbrella under which
U.S.-Soviet joint ventures will be negotiated to produce consumer
goods ranging from cookies to cars.
   No new joint ventures have been signed yet, but negotiations are
under way on several, said consortium president James H. Giffin of
The Mercator Corporation.
   The other six companies involved are Chevron Overseas, RJR
Nabisco, Ford Motor Company, Eastman Kodak, Archer Daniels Midland
and Johnson and Johnson.
   The two plastics plants, to be built near Kalush not far from
the Czechoslovak border, will produce polyvinyl chloride, or PVC,
said Hammer.
   One will produce film for food packaging, wall coverings, pond
and reservoir linings, while the other will produce resins for
vinyl flooring, upholstery fabrics and molded vinyl items, the
company said in a statement.
   Hammer said Occidental is the largest producer of PVC in the
United States.
   The estimated cost of the plants is between $160 million and
$200 million, Hammer said. Three-quarters of the plants' capacities
will be sold in the Soviet Union and its allied countries, but
Occidental will receive 25 percent to sell on the international
market, where it can earn convertible currency.
   One of the major stumbling blocks to more joint ventures is that
the Soviet ruble is not convertible into other currencies, so it is
difficult for Western companies to earn profits that can be taken
out of the Soviet Union.
   Companies must make agreements to produce goods that can be sold
outside the Soviet Union for hard currency or agree to take other
kinds of Soviet goods that they can sell abroad.
   Hammer announced in November that Occidental Petroleum, Italian
and Japanese companies would participate in another joint venture
to build a petrochemical complex near the Caspian Sea.
   Occidental President Ray Irani told the news conference
negotiations on the two plastics factories began in late 1986 but
originally focused on another site. Once the focus shifted to the
Kalush site, negotiations were completed in six months, he said.

   International Business Machines Corp. today
reported strong first-quarter earnings on sharply higher revenue,
which analysts called an important signal that the world's largest
computer company is snapping back after a disappointing slump.
   IBM said earnings for the three months ended March 31 totaled
$913 million, or $1.53 a share, up from $785 million, or $1.30 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $11.75 billion, a 10 percent
increase over 1987 first-quarter revenue of $10.68 billion.
   ``I think it's very very good,'' said Peter Labe, a computer
analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. ``It's a better
revenue gain than anybody was expecting.''
   Analysts said the improvements were particularly encouraging
because they followed a string of lower-than-expected results for
the company and came during a quarter that historically is the
weakest in the computer industry.
   The gains in earnings and sales also came despite a higher tax
rate and fears of a business-spending cutback in the aftermath of
the stock market crash six months ago.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, IBM jumped $1.37{ to $115 a
share in heavy trading, a reflection of investor confidence.
   ``IBM's business continues to improve,'' Chairman John F. Akers
said in a statement from the company's world headquarters in
Armonk, N.Y. ``We are pleased that customers are responding
positively to our strengthened product line.''
   IBM's financial health is regarded as an important barometer of
the computer industry and the competitive position of U.S.
companies in world markets. The company's products are widely
considered the industry's trend-setters.
   The company is a leading producer of information handling
systems, equipment and services with products ranging from large
computer networks to personal computers, typewriters, copiers and
other office machinery.
   Earlier this year IBM announced the enhancement or introduction
of several product lines ranging from system printers to its
Personal System 2 personal computers.
   It also announced a restructuring that Akers said would make the
company respond more quickly to customers and ``compete more
vigorously in all of our lines of business.''

   The stock market was mixed today as traders
cashed in some of the gains from the rally of the past six sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.49 to
2,111.57 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 397 up, 576 down and
524 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 29.52 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   International Business Machines gave a boost to the Dow Jones
industrial average, rising 1] to 115.
   Analysts generally gave good reviews to the company's
first-quarter results, which showed earnings at $1.53 a share, up
from $1.30 in the comparable period of 1987.
   Otherwise, however, brokers said the mood was cautious and
subdued.
   Wall Street is looking for favorable news from the meeting today
of the so-called Group of Seven industrialized countries in
Washington, and from Thursday's report by the Commerce Department
on the nation's trade balance for February.
   But many traders apparently are worried that whatever positive
stimulus comes from those sources may have been already reflected
in stock prices with the market's advance of late.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.09 to 153.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .21 at 306.80.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 14.09 to
2,110.08, bringing its advance over the past six sessions to more
than 129 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 879 up, 621 down and 471 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 140.40 million shares, against 146.37 million shares in the
previous session.

   Finance leaders from the world's top
industrial countries met today in rare harmony for a session at
which they were expected to reaffirm a four-month-old pact that has
successfully stabilized the value of the dollar.
   The finance ministers and heads of the central banks of the
seven nations were meeting at a session hosted by Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III.
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters before
the meeting started that he expected cordial discussions with
little disagreement.
   ``The conference will not be so difficult, unlike the others we
have had before,'' he said.
   German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he was looking
forward to ``good discussions.''
   The meetings began with a session of the Group of Five
countries, the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain and
France. They were joined later in the morning by Italy and Canada.
   In the past, wrangling between the countries over interest
rates, proper currency levels and trade imbalances has sent
financial markets into an uproar.
   But this time there appear to be no major disagreements.
America's allies are happy that the country is finally making
progress to reduce its huge federal budget deficit, which they
blame for keeping world interest rates high, and the Reagan
administration has been pleased that Japan and West Germany are
doing more to stimulate growth in their countries, actions expected
to reduce the huge U.S. foreign trade deficit.
   The seven nations pledged Dec. 22 in a communique worked out
long-distance to support the value of the dollar at its current
leels. That pact has been working, lending reassurance to jittery
financial markets.
   There had been fears that the global collapse of stock markets
on Oct. 19 would lead to a worldwide recession in 1988, but that
doomsday scenario failed to materialize.
   The world economy is growing at a faster pace than expected
while a relentless downward slide in the dollar, which contributed
to last fall's market turmoil, has been at least temporarily halted.
   ``The major industrial countries of the world obviously favor
stability of exchange rates and we have been very pleased with the
stability we have seen since ... December,'' Baker said Monday.
   While the industrial countries have repeatedly professed a
harmony of views over the past three years, their disagreements
over currency values, trade imbalances and interest rates have
often roiled financial markets.
   The administration and its economic allies launched an effort in
September 1985 to push the value of the dollar down as a way of
reducing the soaring U.S. trade imbalance, believing that a weaker
dollar would curb Americans' appetite for imports while making U.S.
goods more competitive on overseas markets.
   The administration formally abandoned that push in February 1987
at a meeting in Paris with its economic allies.
   However, the dollar continued to slide for much of 1987, often
lurching downward with each monthly release of the latest U.S.
trade deficit total, showing the imbalance between what the country
imported and what it sold abroad was remaining at stubbornly high
levels.
   This convinced financial markets that despite the
administration's public pledge, it secretly wanted the dollar to go
lower.
   The falling dollar raised inflation fears in this country and
prompted the Federal Reserve last September to boost interest
rates. The turmoil involving the dollar and higher interest rates
are often cited as two factors which helped spark the October stock
market collapse.
   The collapse served as frightening evidence of the dangers in
economic disunity and spurred a Dec. 22 pledge by the top economic
powers to work harder to keep the dollar from falling further.
   That commitment was backed up by massive intervention in
currency markets, the process by which governments buy weak
currencies to prop up their value.
   In addition to reaffirming the December pact, the finance
ministers are also expected to review and perhaps agree to a novel
idea first advanced by Baker last September to use the price of
gold and other commodities to help the top economic powers
coordinate their policies.
   Baker has stressed that he is not proposing a return to a gold
standard, the system by which currencies were stabilized for a
quarter century following World War II.
   Rather, Baker has said the commodity basket of goods should be
added to the other economic indicators the countries have been
using since the Tokyo economic summit in 1986 to measure their
performances. This group of indicators includes individual growth
rates, inflation and trade balances.
   Baker's commodity basket of products including gold would
introduce a price-sensitive measure into the economic planning
process. If commodity prices were rising in particular countries,
they would be encouraged to boost interest rates to fight
inflation. But if commodity prices were failing in certain
countries, those nations would know they had room to cut interest
rates and stimulate economic growth.
   Some countries, in particular West Germany, have opposed the
commodity index, seeing it as a device whi   In one new initiative on Third
World debt, World Bank President
Barber Conable announced Tuesday the formation of a new worldwide
agency to insure private investors against loss from war and other
hostile actions.
   Conable said the new Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency,
which will start with $1.08 billion, would attract more direct
investment into Third World countries by issuing insurance policies
to protect investors.

   Directors of Staley Continental
Inc. have put off a decision on a $1.33 billion takeover offer from
the British sugar refiner Tate & Lyle PLC.
   The Staley board met Tuesday, but decided not to take any action
on Tate & Lyle's cash tender offer, spokesman G. David Satterfield
said.
   Satterfield said Staley, the second largest U.S. refiner of
corn, would announce its position on the offer before April 21. He
refused further comment, except to say that the company was urging
stockholders to postpone any decisions on their shares until after
the board makes its recommendation.
   The Tate & Lyle offer, which works out to $32 per share, will
expire at midnight May 5.
   Staley was unchanged at $36.75 in early New York Stock Exchange
trading today.
   Tate & Lyle chairman Neil Shaw met with state legislators in
Springfield Tuesday. Shaw said he and colleagues had met with local
officials so the public would see that ``we're not financial
operators, we are manufacturers.''
   At a news conference, Shaw called his company's offer ``a very
good price,'' but refused to speculate about any possible change in
negotiations with Staley.
   The acquisition of Staley would give Tate & Lyle its first
interest in the U.S. corn-sweetener market. The company said it
would become the only supplier of all three types of sugar _ corn,
beet and cane _ in the United States.
   Tate & Lyle currently owns nearly 5 percent of Staley's stock.
   Staley Continental is a holding company formed in early 1985 for
the A.E. Staley Mfg. Co. of Decatur, Ill., a leading corn
processor, and CFS Continental Inc. of Chicago, a food-service
supplier.
   Staley's main corn product is high fructose corn syrup, known as
HFCS. The company has about a fourth of the $1 billion-a-year U.S.
market for HFCS sales, Tate & Lyle said.
   Also Tuesday, the Staley board promoted Robert M. Powers to
president and chief operating officer, holding the No. 2 position
behind Donald E. Nordlund, Staley chairman and chief executive
officer.

traders cashed in some of the gains from the rally of the past six
sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 129 points
in the past six trading days, fell back 14.26 to 2,095.82 by 11
a.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 387 up, 874
down and 488 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 79.78 million shares at
midmorning.
   The market's decline came despite buying in International
Business Machines, which rose 1\ to 114~.
   Analysts generally gave high marks to the company's
first-quarter results, which showed earnings at $1.53 a share, up
from $1.30 in the comparable period of 1987.
   Otherwise, however, brokers said the mood was cautious and
subdued.
   Wall Street is looking for favorable news from the meeting today
of the so-called Group of Seven industrialized countries in
Washington, and from Thursday's report by the Commerce Department
on the nation's trade balance for February.
   But many traders apparently are worried that whatever positive
stimulus comes from those sources may have been already reflected
in stock prices with the market's advance of late.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.71 to 152.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .46 at 306.13.

<HEAD>EEC Threatens GATT Complaint On Japanese Car Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
Commission Wednesday threatened to take its opposition to Japanese
taxes on car imports to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
if Japan does not answer EEC complaints within two weeks.
   EEC External Affairs Commissioner Willy De Clercq will raise the
issue at a meeting with Japan's Commerce Minister Hajime Tamura in
Vancouver, British Columbia, this weekend, an EEC spokeswoman said.
   U.S., Canadian, EEC and Japanese officials will meet for trade
talks in the Canadian city.
   Japan levies special taxes on cars with engines bigger than 2
liters and a width of more than 1.7 meters. As most European cars
imported by Japan exceed these measures, the EEC finds the taxes
discriminatory.
   The EEC spokeswoman said the EEC believes the tax ``unduly
penalizes EEC imports in various ways'' and might take the matter
to GATT if it does not get a satisfactory answer by the end of the
month.
   GATT is a 94-nation organization that oversees international
trade.
   On another issue, De Clercq will seek a Japanese pledge in
Vancouver that it will not discriminate against EEC firms under the
U.S.-Japan accord of last week to open Japanese public works
projects to U.S. bidders.
   De Clercq will also meet with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter on bilateral issues such as a dispute over an EEC ban on
hormones in meat and soybean trade as well as prospects for
adoption of the U.S. omnibus trade bill.

<HEAD>Boeing Defends Jet Quality Following Airlines' Complaints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EVERETT, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent news coverage about several
airlines' complaints concerning defects in Boeing's widebody 747
and 767 jetliners was due partly to Boeing's open way of dealing
with its problems, company officials say.
   Furthermore, more Boeing workers are now aware of items that
need improving, Phil Condit, Boeing Commercial Airplanes executive
vice president, said Tuesday.
   ``Air transportation is the safest transportation mode there
is'' and is getting even safer because airlines, manufacturers and
regulatory agencies work together to identify and correct problems,
Condit said.
   Boeing's news conference came one day after the Federal Aviation
Administration confirmed it has issued 50 airworthiness directives
in the last two years telling airlines to fix various problems with
Boeing jets.
   The most recent warning, issued Friday, concerned possible fuel
leaks in the cargo area of Boeing 747-200s. The leaks can be caused
by a bolt giving way in a wing section, and airlines using the jets
were ordered to inspect them before returning the planes to service.
   Boeing officials said the order applied to 317 operating
747-200s.
   Airlines, Boeing and FAA officials have said none of the defects
cited to date has been linked to a crash or other major damage.
   Condit said that as soon as a problem is discovered, Boeing
corrects it and notifies all operators of the plane, along with
regulatory agencies.
   Boeing, which had more than 50 percent of the worldwide
commercial jet market last year, writes about 1,000 service
bulletins annually to point out improvements or possible problems,
Condit said. Most are minor, but he said some are serious enough to
require an airworthiness directive to ensure all carriers check for
the problem.
   Condit said the recent reports presented only a ``snapshot''
view of Boeing's ongoing process of checking its planes to see how
they can be improved.
   Because Boeing has become more open with its work force, sharing
customer complaints and asking for employees' advice on solving
problems, it's more likely that word of such problems will reach
the public, he said.
   In addition, Boeing this year started an ``audit'' of its
aircraft testing procedures, to make sure problems aren't falling
through the cracks, Condit said.
   Last year, Boeing added more than 3,000 workers at its Everett
widebody plant, bringing employment there to about 14,000, said
William Shineman, vice president and general manager of the Everett
division. Another 500 to 1,000 will be hired this year, he said.
   He and Condit acknowledged that as Boeing increases 747 and 767
production, there's an increased potential for defects until
production methods, new staff and suppliers are brought to speed.
   The FAA monitors manufacture of U.S. civilian aircraft to ensure
they meet design specifications. Nick Wantiez of the Seattle FAA
office said Tuesday that in recent months, the agency expanded
those investigations at Boeing to include the recent airline
complaints, which range from wrong parts to incorrectly installed
firefighting systems.
   He said the most recent directive came after reports of
complaints by Japan Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Lufthansa, Air
India, Aerolineas Argentinas and a leasing company, starting Nov.
21 with a JAL report in Los Angeles of a fuel leak involving a bolt
that had broken from corrosion.
   Complaints about other problems have also been sent to Boeing by
American Airlines, British Airways, JAL and All Nippon, a domestic
Japanese carrier.
   The problems cited by All Nippon included a wing flap
disintegrating in flight on the first day of service, smoke from a
misassembled power unit that caused an emergency landing, and
problems in a fire extinguisher system.
   JAL and American also complained about the fire-suppression
system.
   Condit said all of the problems reported had been fixed.

   Ply-Gem Industries Inc. has agreed to
terminate a merger agreement with Wolverine Technologies Inc. after
a French industrial group offered more for the manufacturer of
vinyl siding and windows.
   A subsidiary of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain of France, SG
Acquisition Corp., began a tender offer Monday of $23 a share, or
about $75.9 million, for Wolverine Technologies.
   Ply-Gem, based in New York, had previously offered $18.50 a
share under an offer that expired at midnight Tuesday. It agreed to
terminate its merger agreement in return for $4.7 million.
   Thomas Jeffers, Wolverine vice president and treasurer, said the
company's board was studying the Saint-Gobain offer and would make
a recommendation to shareholders by April 21.
   The Saint-Gobain offer extends through May 6 and is conditional
on at least 2.1 million of 3.3 million outstanding Wolverine
Technologies shares being tendered.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Steady To Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened steady to
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders were taking profits after recent jumps, especially in
soybean and wheat, said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   ``I think generally it's a wait-and-see type of thing,'' Spilka
said. ``Trade is mostly bullish. At the same time, the markets have
rallied in recent days. What you're seeing this morning is
profit-taking. The markets have moved pretty fast to the upside.''
   The markets appeared to be drifting lower because of the lack of
bullish fundamentals, he said.
   Wheat opened higher, then tapered off. Corn was off slightly
while soybeans were also down.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.20\ per bushel; corn was {
cent to 1} cents lower with May at $2.05 per bushel; oats were
unchanged to { cent higher with May at $1.66} per bushel; soybeans
were 1\ cents to 3{ cents lower with May at $6.78 per bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .88 cent lower to .40 cent higher with April at
73.87 cents per pound; feeder cattle were .62 cent lower to .05
cent higher with April at 79.60 cents per pound; hogs were .02 cent
to .50 cent lower with April at 45.15 cents per pound; frozen pork
bellies were .57 cent lower to .25 cent higher with May at 52.45
cents per pound.
   Livestock and meat futures closed sharply lower Tuesday.

   Retail sales, spurred by gains at department
stores and auto showrooms, rose a strong 0.8 percent in March, the
fifth consecutive increase, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales rose a seasonally
adjusted $1.1 billion to $130.7 billion.
   Sales were strong in all categories except furniture stores and
restaurants, and were well above expectations. Most economists
before today predicted an increase of 0.2 percent to 0.3 percent.
   The March increase came atop a 0.6 percent gain in February,
revised upward from the 0.4 percent estimate released a month ago.
   The latest rise was the strongest since a 1.1 percent increase
in December. Ever since the October stock market crash, economists
have watched retail sales closely for signs that the consumer
sector of the economy would weaken.
   But more recently, some analysts have raised fears that too much
consumer demand could re-fire inflation and lead to higher interest
rates.
   Much of the strength in March came from sales at department and
other general merchandise stores. Boosted by an earlier-than-usual
Easter, their sales rose 1.6 percent following a 2.6 percent
decrease in February.
   Auto sales rose 0.9 percent, following a 2.0 percent increase a
month earlier. Excluding autos, sales were up 0.8 percent, the same
as the overall rise.
   Sales of all durable goods, items expected to last three or more
years, were up 0.5 percent, while non-durable goods were up 1.0
percent.
   The department offered these details of March sales:
   _ Hardware and garden supply stores, up 0.5 percent after
soaring 3.0 percent in February.
   _ Furniture and appliance stores, down 2.0 percent after a
strong 2.9 percent increase a month earlier.
   _ Food and grocery stores, up 1.1 percent after an earlier 0.6
percent rise.
   _ Gasoline, up 1.4 percent following a 1.2 percent decline.
   _ Specialty clothing stores, up 0.3 percent; restaurants and
bars, down 0.6 percent, and drug stores, up 1.6 percent.

<HEAD>A Plausible Explanation for Extreme Events</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At various times in the past two decades or so
the U.S. economy was gripped by extremes, measured mainly as
inflationary booms and recessionary busts, but by lesser
indicators, too.
   The savings rate dropped to historic lows. Unemployment reached
double-digit levels. Housing prices soared five times. Borrowing
and interest rates hit record highs. Odd things kept happening
throughout the economy.
   Seeking explanations, some economic theorists came up with
equally odd theories, the most popular of them being that the
nation had lost its work ethic and common sense and was on a
relentless course downward.
   Now comes evidence that maybe what happened to produce these
events, or to exacerbate them, was a factor so obvious it wasn't
duly considered _ an unlikely possibility until you take into
account the imperfections of human perception.
   That unlikely cause was the baby boom of 1946 to 1964.
   Edward Yardeni, an economist for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., contends that the boom not only caused some of those extreme
readings but is likely to produce a few extremes, mainly positive,
for the future as well.
   ``The baby boomers have had a tremendous influence on our
economy,'' says Yardeni, 38 years old and therefore a boomer
himself.
   ``Undoubtedly they will continue to be extraordinarily
influential. Yet most models of the economy completely ignore
demographic trends,'' he said.
   Background:
   During the 19 years between 1946 and 1964, more than 76 million
babies were born in the United States, almost one-third of our
present population. This, of course, produced a population bulge
that, as it moved through the years, produced economic change.
   In the 1970s inflation roared and unemployment soared as baby
boomers overwhelmed the job market.
   ``They entered the labor force faster than the economy could
create jobs,'' says Yardeni, observing that the labor force rose
11.3 percent in the 1950s and 18 percent in the 1960s _ compared
with 30 percent in the 1970s.
   As the jobless rate rose, policymakers responded by stimulating
the economy in an effort to create more jobs for the boomers.
Politicians knew also that the boomers were entering another
marketplace, the political arena.
   So, Yardeni notes, economic policy became biased towards
inflation.
   ``Inflation didn't bother the baby boomers. They could beat
inflation by getting married and bringing home two paychecks. Those
two paychecks, in turn, gave them the purchasing power to fuel even
more inflation.''
   They needed a place to live, so they leveraged their paychecks
with large mortgages for condominiums and houses, forcing housing
prices to rise even faster than the general level of inflation.
Interest rates rose, too.
   They needed items to fill those houses, so they consumed
eagerly. They needed furniture and appliances and cars, and that
didn't leave much money to save, especially since they were still
well below their peak earning years.
   Now, as the demographic bulge moves on, the baby boomers are
growing older and leaving behind the habits of the young.
Increasingly, the high-spending Yuppies are shifting to the
conservative, savings-minded ``couch potato'' stage.
   So, says Yardeni, we can expect this within the next five years:
   _The savings rate will rise from the current 5.4 percent to 10
percent, a rate previously not reached in peacetime for any
sustained period of time.
   _The jobless rate will fall to 4 percent from March's level of
5.6 percent.
   _Increases in consumer spending should slow markedly.
   _Home prices should rise at a much slower pace.
   _Productivity should grow rapidly because the boomers will have
peak skills. This same factor should help keep the inflation rate
low.
   While other factors contributed to the extremes of the past two
decades, it is difficult to argue that Yardeni's demographics
didn't play a very large role _ a role so big it seems incredible
it wasn't given proper attention.
   The message now is a pleasant one: The baby boomer bulge that
gave the economy indigestion for two decades is now spelling relief.

   Share prices ended slightly higher Wednesday, with
most of the activity coming in the morning as Swiss chocolate maker
Jacobs Suchard S.A. launched a ``dawn raid'' that netted it 14.9
percent of British confectioner Rowntree PLC shares.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 5.1
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,810.4 at the close.
   Rowntree's share price soared as Suchard stepped in, pulling up
stocks in the food and store sectors.
   Oil shares also continued to firm before the April 25 meeting of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The index moved up as much as 11.3 points shortly after the
opening, but hit a low of 3.1 points up in late afternoon on the
back of early losses on Wall Street.
   Volume was moderate at 514.2 million shares, up from 364.7
million on Tuesday.
   There was little institutional buying interest, dealers said, as
many players remained on the sidelines awaiting developments from a
gathering of monetary officials of the Group of Seven major
industrialized countries in Washington on Wednesday. Caution also
prevailed before Thursday's release of U.S. February trade figures.
   The activity in Rowntree was the major news of the day, as
Suchard picked up 32.0 million shares, or 14.9 percent, at 630
pence each. The Swiss company said it plans to increase its holding
to not more than 25 percent, and doesn't intend bidding for all of
Rowntree.
   Rowntree shares leaped 146 pence to close at 623 pence, after
trading as high as 633 pence.

   The U.S. dollar rose slightly in quiet European
trading Wednesday as the market awaited news from a monetary
meeting of the Group of Seven major industrial nations and
Thursday's release of U.S. trade figures.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the market was mostly quiet before
an expected statement from the G-7 meeting of finance ministers and
central bankers in Washington. Some bullish sentiments reflected
expectations of a dollar-supporting statement from the group, they
said.
   Other U.S. currency gains came late in the day as market players
took positions before Thursday's release of figures on the U.S.
trade balance in February.
   There was speculation that the U.S. trade deficit has shrunk
from January's $12.4 billion gap, perhaps as low as $10 billion.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar dipped 0.05 yen to a closing 126.45 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 126.30 yen.
   Other dollar rates late Wednesday, compared with late Tuesday:
1.6895 West German marks, up from 1.6853; 1.3983 Swiss francs, up
from 1.3967; 5.7295 French francs, up from 5.7165; 1.8950 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8890; 1,252.50 Italian lire, up from 1,249.75;
and 1.2367 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2370.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8445, cheaper for buyers
than late Tuesday's $1.8515.
   Gold bullion was sold at a bid price of $449.25 a troy ounce
late Wednesday, down from late Tuesday's $451. At midmorning
Wednesday, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $448.50.
   Traders said trading was lackluster in Europe because most
participants have squared their positions ahead of the release of
U.S. trade figures.
   In Zurich, gold's bid price was $449.50 an ounce, down from $451
late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.39 to close at a
bid $450.82.
   Silver was quoted in London Wednesday at a bid price of $6.41 a
troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.45.

   Two western Pennsylvania congressmen Wednesday
introduced legislation in Washington aimed at preventing investment
firms and foreign bank holding companies from pursuing certain
corporate takeovers.
   Rep. Doug Walgren, a Democrat, and Rep. Tom Ridge, a Republican,
said their proposal stemmed from the $1.7 billion takeover battle
for Koppers Co., a Pittsburgh-based cement and building materials
concern.
   British industrialist Brian C. Beazer joined with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. and National Westminster Bank PLC in launching a
bid for the company.
   The congressmen said their bill would prohibit a financial
services company that owns an federally insured bank from taking
more than a 5 percent equity interest in a company not involved in
financial services.
   Shearson owns Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Co., which ranks as
the nation's 20th largest bank. It also owns nearly 50 percent in
BNS, the company Beazer formed to make the bid for Koppers.
   The Ridge-Walgren bill also would prohibit a foreign bank
holding company that owns a federally insured bank from using its
financial resources to acquire interest in a company not engaged in
financial services.
   ``If investment banks are permitted to become full partners in
takeover efforts through an equity interest _ that is, to go beyond
the traditional role of lending money _ corporate America will be
controlled by banks at unprecedented levels,'' Walgren said.
   The bill is expected to be referred to the House Banking
Committee, Walgren's office said. Ridge serves on that committee.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., has introduced similar legislation in
the Senate.

   The federal government today announced a
special investigation of Texas Air Corp. to determine whether the
nation's largest airline company and its management are ``fit,
willing and able'' to carry commercial air traffic.
   The investigation by the Transportation Department came as the
Federal Aviation Administration announced a civil penalty of
$823,000 against Eastern Airlines, a Texas Air subsidiary, because
of ``recurring trends'' of violations of safety regulations.
   Transportation Secretary James Burnley told a news conference
the investigation of Texas Air Corp. will be completed within 30
days and is being conducted to determine whether the company is
complying with federal regulations and whether its management is
competent to operate commercial aircraft.
   Burnley said that one reason for the investigation is the FAA's
fine against Eastern, which came just over a year after Eastern
agreed to pay a $9.5 million fine in connection with other safety
violations.
   In addition, he said, the department's concerns were raised
after an examination of Texas Air's financial filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission which showed the airline company
to be ``under substantial, increasing financial pressure.''
   Texas Air Corp. had record losses since the beginning of 1987,
Burnley said. It had a net loss of $466 million last year.
   B. Wayne Vance, the departmemt's general counsel, said 15 to 20
government economists and auditors will focus on Texas Air Corp.'s
financial records, management practices and the circumstances
surrounding Texas Air's purchase of Eastern and more recent
attempts to shift Eastern assets away from the Miami-based airline.
   In its order directing the 30-day investigation of Texas Air,
the department said recent filings by Texas Air with the SEC
suggest ``a need to examine ... (Eastern's and Continental's)
financial fitness.''
   ``The recent activities of the Texas Air and its carriers
-particularly Continental and Eastern - raise questions concerning
whether the carriers can and are disposed to comply with the safety
and economic rules applicable to air carriers,'' the order said.
   Texas Air, which is based in Houston, is the parent company for
Eastern and Continental Airlines. Together, these two carriers
account for nearly 20 percent of the commercial airline market.
   In a separate action, FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said the
FAA will begin an in-depth, 30-day inspection of Eastern that
``will literally touch every one of Eastern's 267 planes'' to
determine whether they are being operated within federal safety
requirements.
   McArtor said at the same time the agency has proposed a civil
penalty of $823,000 against Eastern for alleged violations already
discovered in the Miami-based airline.
   The new round of inspections by FAA teams was prompted by ``what
appears to be recurring trends of non-compliance'' of safety
regulations. ``I am concerned about the degree to which Eastern
management systems are providing adequate supervision and control
over Eastern's (aircraft) fleet,'' McArtor said.

<HEAD>France Fetes New York Couple As 500 Millionth Tourist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France rolled out the red carpet Wednesday for a
New York couple chosen to symbolize the 500 millionth foreign
tourist to visit the country during the past 20 years.
   Mr. and Mrs. John Benchivenga of Brooklyn, who arrived here
Tuesday by Concorde, were selected from lists of travelers who made
reservations for April 12 on Air France, the French national
airline. They were on a regularly scheduled evening flight but were
upgraded to Concorde after their names were selected.
   The Benchivengas, who have three children, had a whirlwind,
luxury tour of the capital Wednesday beginning with lunch at the
Jules Vernes restaurant at the Eiffel Tower with French singer
Charles Aznavour and French tourism minister Jean-Jacques Descamps.
   Earlier they went on a guided tour of the year-old Orsay Museum
of 19th century art and in the afternoon visited some of Paris'
most elegant designer boutiques.
   ``It's like a second honeymoon, a dream, the kind of thing that
only happens once in every second or third life,'' Benchivenga, a
43-year-old IBM executive, told reporters.
   The celebrations are part of a government campaign to
``sensitize the French to the importance of giving foreign tourists
a warm welcome,'' Descamps said.
   He said Americans were chosen to symbolize the 500 and 501
millionth tourists because American tourism, after a disastrous
year in 1986 due to terrorism and the falling dollar, was again on
the rise.

<TEXT>
   Diamandis Communications Inc., a leading
consumer magazine publisher, said Wednesday it has agreed to be
acquired by the French communications concern Hachette SA in a deal
valued at $712 million.
   The announcement came four days after Hachette reached an
agreement to buy Grolier Inc., a Danbury, Conn.-based book
publisher, for $450 million.
   The Diamandis deal includes 12 consumer magazines, including
Woman's Day, Car and Driver, Popular Photography, Road & Track and
Boating.
   Diamandis Communications was created only last fall when it
acquired the magazine division of CBS Inc. for $650 million.
   The buyout team included the management of the CBS magazine
division led by the division's president, Peter G. Diamandis, with
financing from the merchant banking subsidiaries of Prudential
Insurance Company of America.
   At the time of the purchase, it was reported that Hachette had
talked with CBS about buying its magazine group, which included 19
magazines at the time.
   Since buying the magazine from CBS, Diamandis has sold seven of
them.
   Prudential and Diamandis said in Wednesday's announcement that
the sale to Hachette combined with previous asset sales and excess
cash flow would bring the total proceeds generated by the
originally acquired properties to more than $1 billion.
   Hachette, which is based in Paris, has interests in television,
radio, magazines and book publishing.
   It is making the magazine acquisition through its Hachette
Publications Inc., a subsidiary of Hachette's magazine group.

   The stock market pulled back today as traders
cashed in some of the gains from the rally of the past six sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 129 points
in the past six trading days, fell 9.78 to 2,100.30 by 3 p.m. today
on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 9 to 5 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 519 up, 957
down and 458 unchanged.
   The market's decline came despite buying in International
Business Machines, which rose 1{ to 115[.
   Analysts generally gave high marks to the company's
first-quarter results, which showed earnings at $1.53 a share, up
from $1.30 in the comparable period of 1987.
   Otherwise, however, brokers said the mood was cautious and
subdued.
   Wall Street is looking for favorable news from the meeting today
of the so-called Group of Seven industrialized countries in
Washington, and from Thursday's report by the Commerce Department
on the nation's trade balance for February.
   But many traders apparently are worried that whatever positive
stimulus comes from those sources may have been already reflected
in stock prices with the market's advance of late.
   Pfizer gained 3[ to 60, apparently benefiting from takeover
rumors and speculation.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.67 to 152.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 1.24 at 305.35.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 158.02 million shares with an

<HEAD>CBS Posts Big Profit Gain on Records Group Sale, Interest Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Wednesday its first-quarter
earnings rocketed higher, but the rise resulted from a huge
one-time profit on the sale of its records group and from interest
earned by investing cash from other asset sales.
   The company said the operating profit of its broadcast group
fell 19 percent compared with strong results a year ago.
   CBS reported an after-tax profit of $911.3 million, or $35.34 a
share, for the January-March period, compared with earnings of
$48.7 million, or $1.93 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 4.6
percent to $696.3 million from $729.7 million.
   The latest results included a one-time gain of $866.6 million
mainly due to the sale of the CBS Records Group to Sony Corp., the
Japanese electronics concern, for $2 billion.
   Income from continuing operations surged to $44.7 million from
$7.8 million a year earlier. But CBS said that was because it
netted $51.7 million on interest income in the latest quarter,
while it had interest expenses of $9.3 million in the same period
in 1987. Its interest income was augmented by a pre-tax gain of $14
million on the sale of Treasury securities.
   CBS has accumulated its cash by selling assets that are not
directly related to its core broadcasting business over the past 18
months. It sold its book and music publishing units in late 1986
and its magazine division in 1987.
   The CBS Broadcast Group made an operating profit of $15.6
million, down from $21.9 million, mainly because of lower results
for the CBS television network, which has seen its prime time
ratings slump to third place behind NBC and ABC for the first time.
   The TV network's results a year ago benefitted from the
inclusion of broadcasts of college basketball's and professional
football's championship games. Another network carried the Super
Bowl football game this year and the CBS telecasts of the NCAA
basketball finals occurred in the second quarter.
   CBS said that net sales for the broadcast group, which were off
5 percent at $696.2 million, would have improved if the impact of
the sporting events were excluded.
   ``Despite a difficult sales environment, Broadcast Group
earnings met our budgeted expectations,'' said Laurence A. Tisch,
president and chief executive officer.

   The Federal National Mortgage Association,
which buys mortgages and packages them into securities for
investors, said Wednesday its earnings rose 71 percent in the first
three months of the year.
   Aside from an unusual gain in the fourth quarter of last year,
attributed to accounting changes, earnings for the January to March
period were the highest quarterly earnings in the association's
history, said David O. Maxwell, Fannie Mae chairman.
   For the first quarter, earnings totaled $100.9 million, or $1.27
a share, up from $58.9 million, 75 cents a share, for the same
period in 1987.
   Fourth-quarter 1987 earnings, with the accounting adjustment,
were $195 million, or $2.40 a share. Without the adjustment,
earnings were $60.4 million, or 75 cents per share.
   Maxwell attributed the strong first quarter to Fannie Mae's
effort to reduce its sensitivity to interest rates. The company's
net interest income was $170.8 million in the first quarter,
compared with $102.9 million a year ago.

   Exxon Co. U.S.A. is swapping 92 gas stations in
Southern California and three other states for 92 Texaco Inc.
service stations in the San Francisco area, company officials said.
   As part of the agreement announced Wednesday, Texaco has agreed
to offer Texaco-brand motor fuel franchise agreements to all Exxon
dealers who are leasing service station property from Exxon in
connection with their sale of Exxon-brand motor fuel.
   The Exxon stations involved in the trade are in San Diego, San
Bernardino and Riverside counties in California; Clark County,
Nev.; Clackamas, Multnoman, Washington and Yamhill counties in
Oregon; and Clark County in Washington.
   The market withdrawal by Exxon from those counties will involve
about 90 Exxon stations and 11 distributors and takes effect Oct.
31, Exxon U.S.A. spokesman Les Rogers said.
   Exxon U.S.A., the Houston domestic subsidiary of Exxon Corp.,
said it has been concerned with the increasing difficulty of
providing motor fuel supplies to certain West Coast markets.
   It has also had an interest in obtaining secure local markets
for motor fuel produced at the company's Benicia Refinery in the
San Francisco Bay area, Rogers said.

   Soybean futures closed down as much as 9 cents
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade and the grain markets
followed suit as traders took profits amid an absence of bullish
news.
   Soybeans started the day lower and plunged near the bell,
extending for a second day a sell-off that follows last week's
rally linked to government reports indicating potentially tight
supplies.
   ``What you're seeing is a normal fall,'' said Walter Spilka, a

``There's no bullish news at the moment. When you don't have it,
you have profit-taking, which we are having now.''
   Wheat and corn slid, despite a planned meeting this week between
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and officials from India about a
potential deal for wheat.
   Spilka said traders believe nothing will come out of the
discussions.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.18 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents

   A group led by Prudential-Bache Interfunding Inc.
will become a major stockholder in the new firm merging the
Seven-Up and Dr Pepper holding companies, officials said Wednesday
as they announced terms of the $1.3 billion transaction.
   Prudential-Bache Interfunding _ the merchant banking arm of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. _ and other investors will own 49
percent of Dr Pepper-Seven-Up Cos. Inc., which will be the third
largest soft drink company in the nation behind Coca-Cola Co. and
Pepsico.
   After the deal is completed, existing shareholders and senior
management will own 51 percent of the merged operation, the
companies said in a statement. Dr Pepper Holding Co. and Seven-Up
Holding Co. announced last month they had agreed to merge.
   The companies' current stockholders will be paid a total of $500
million in cash and $100 million in debt and preferred stock, the
statement said.
   Exactly how much will go to each company's stockholders has not
been determined, spokesman Tom Bayer said.
   Prudential-Bache's role in the new company was not foreseen by
management of Seven-Up and Dr Pepper when the pair announced their
initial merger agreement, Bayer said.
   Prudential-Bache approached the companies in March and proposed
to buy into the merged operation, he said.
   Financing for the transaction incudes about $75 million of
additional bank borrowings by Dr Pepper and approximately $125
million by Seven-Up, arranged with Bankers Trust Co.
   The transaction is expected to be consummated within 60 days,
company officials said. No new management changes are expected,
said John R. Albers, chief executive officer of both Dr Pepper and
Seven-Up.
   Thomas O. Hicks and Robert B. Haas, who will be co-chairmen of
Dr Pepper-Seven-Up Cos. Inc., led separate investment groups in the
purchase of Dr Pepper Co. and the Seven-Up Co. in 1986.
   The companies together have more than 800 employees, 500 of whom
are in the Dallas headquarters. The remainder are field sales
personnel or management and staff of the Technical Center in St.
Louis, Mo., where the companies make their concentrates.

<TEXT>
   Albert Casey, who piloted American Airlines to
profitability as its president during the turbulent deregulation of
the 1970s, could find the ride even bumpier as the new chief of
ailing First RepublicBank Corp., analysts said Wednesday.
   Texas' largest bank-holding company announced Tuesday that it
expects to lose $1.5 billion for the first quarter, even after a $1
billion emergency cash infusion last month.
   In addition, its top executives have left in a steady stream,
the latest on Tuesday when chairman and chief executive officer
Gerald W. Fronterhouse resigned.
   Casey, 68, named president and chief executive officer by the
bank's board of directors the same day, has been described by
financial analysts and former employees as both a motivator and a
hatchet man.
   He was credited with stripping Fort Worth-based AMR Corp.,
American's parent company, of layers of bureacracy and mercilessly
streamlining its operations. His was one of the few major airlines
showing a profit when he stepped down as its president in 1984.
   ``Casey smiles a broad Irish smile, shakes hands with a firm
grip and tells the best jokes at any dinner party,'' said an
executive once fired by Casey. ``But he carries a big stick and
doesn't mind using it.''
   But Casey is also known as a ``people man,'' an executive who
works well with others and motivates his employees.
   ``Al Casey is clearly an outstanding executive who has had very
broad experience,'' said Robert F. Erburu, chairman of the Times
Mirror Co. and a former Casey associate. ``He is well-versed in
problem-solving and possesses skills as an outstanding motivator of
people with special strengths in financial matters.''
   First RepublicBank Corp. presents the veteran corporate
repairman with a daunting set of challenges:
   _A projected $1.5 billion first-quarter loss, triple that of
corporate projections.
   _Panicked depositors, whose run on First RepublicBank was
stemmed March 17 by a six-month, $1 billion emergency loan from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   _Resignations of top executives _ including the chairman of its
lead bank in Dallas _ and the company's largest shareholder, Dallas
Cowboys owner H.R. ``Bum'' Bright.
   As a condition of the emergency aid from the FDIC, top
executives agreed to resign if asked following a financial
examination of the company. Fronterhouse's resignation, timed to
coincide with the stunning revelation of First RepublicBank's
quarterly figures, threw a spotlight on the new chief executive.
   Casey took over AMR in 1974 at a time when it was top-heavy with
management layers brought on by 30 years of government regulation.
   In a series of dramatic moves, Casey sold off holdings
unconnected to running the airline, including large, unprofitable
holdings in hotels.
   ``When I came to American, I just took the whole thing and found
layers and layers of stuff, vice chairman of subsidiaries, hotel
companies and five management consulting firms,'' Casey recalled in
an interview with the Dallas Morning News not long before he
retired from American Airlines. ``(I) fired them all, cleaned them
out.''
   During Casey's 10-year reign, he cut American's cost per
operating unit by 25 percent. The company relocated from New York
to Fort Worth and liquidated its money-losing hotel business.
   ``Casey's whole career has been one of financial markets,'' said
Donald J. Carty, senior vice president at American, who worked with
Casey. ``He knows and is well-respected by every major banker in
the country and by every financial guru on Wall Street.''
   Casey said he would spend the next few weeks reviewing the
existing management team before making further changes at the
company.
   Casey also announced the board's appointment of a new executive
committee with Casey as chairman and Mark Shepherd Jr., chairman of
Texas Instruments Inc., the vice chairman.
   The $1.5 billion loss projected would be the second-largest ever
for a U.S. bank after Citicorp's $2.5 billion loss in second
quarter 1987.
   The bank holding company, the nation's 14th largest in terms of
assets, attributed the loss to a 50 percent increase in its
loan-loss provision, to $231 million, and writedowns from
foreclosed properties, all totaling $1.5 billion.
   The bank reported a loss of $656 million in 1987.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman last month estimated that the
First RepublicBank bailout will cost a total $1.7 billion, although
industry experts say it is likely to cost substantially more.

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. announced
Wednesday it has acquired rights to ``The Muppet Show'' from Jim

   The four-year agreement gives TBS exclusive U.S. telecast rights
to the Emmy Award-winning series, which consists of 120 half-hour

   ``The Muppet Show'' enjoyed consistently successful ratings

Peabody Award for excellence in programming.
   TBS Entertainment Networks President Gerry Hogan said the
program is scheduled to premiere in October on Turner Network
Television, the company's new cable entertainment network, and will
also be made available to SuperStation TBS.
   Turner Broadcasting and Jim Henson Productions also plan to
collaborate on new television projects, the announcement said.
   Henson said he is looking forward to working with TBS Chairman
Ted Turner because ``Ted has some great ideas for family
programming.''

<HEAD>Societe Generale Shareholders To Vote On Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Societe Generale de
Belgique SA are scheduled to vote Thursday on the fate of Belgium's
largest holding company, which is at the center of a bitter
takeover battle.
   The special meeting, expected to attract some 1,000 shareholders
and their representatives, is to start at 9:30 a.m. local time in a
specially built tent at the company's headquarters.
   Hundreds of journalists will monitor the session via
closed-circuit television.
   Societe Generale's outstanding shares will be counted at the
meeting, and a slate of directors will be elected to the company's
board.
   The meeting was requested by Carlo De Bendetti, the flashy
Italian financier who announced nearly three months ago that he
sought control of the 166-year-old company, which has interests in
a third of the Belgian economy.
   De Benedetti, who heads Olivetti SpA, claims he and his
associates own about 49 percent of Societe Generale's 28.2 million
outstanding shares.
   But an alliance led by Cie. Financiere de Suez of France and
Groupe AG, Belgium's biggest insurer, claims to hold a 50.7 percent
stake in the company.
   Shares will be counted for the first time at Thursday's meeting,
and shareholders will establish how many of those shares are valid.
The ownership issue has been clouded by the fact that the Belgian
government does not require shareholders to identify themselves or
their allies.
   On the eve of the meeting, the rival bidders tried once again to
negotiate a settlement but were unsuccessful.
   Cie. Financiere and Groupe AG are expected to claim they can
purchase another 2 million shares that are part of a contested bloc
of 12 million new shares issued to dilute De Benedetti's stake in
the company.
   De Benedetti is seeking seats on the board for himself and two
allies, including Andre Leysen, chairman of Belgium's Gevaert NV.
   His rivals are willing to let him join management but are
opposed to his taking control of the company.
   De Benedetti wants to turn Societe Generale into a pan-European
holding before 1992, when the European Economic Community will
remove a thicket of regulatory curbs that frustrate free movement
of goods and services within the community.
   Societe Generale has its tentacles in some 1,300 companies
involved in banking, financial services, engineering and mining and
chemicals, among other industries.
   During the heated takeover battle, Societe Generale stock shot
up at one point to 10,000 francs a share, or $286. But on
Wednesday, it was trading at 4,830 francs a share, or $138.

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Earnings Up 33 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. reported Wednesday its
earnings increased 33 percent during the first quarter of 1988
although operating profits fell in the company's building products
segment.
   The company reported earnings of $106 million, or $1.02 per
share, compared with $80 million, or 71 cents a share, for the same
quarter last year.
   Sales for the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up from $1.9 billion
in the first quarter of 1987.
   The company's building products operating profits declined to
$108 million from $119 million a year ago.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer T. Marshall Hahn Jr.
attributed the decline to the effect of bad weather on housing
starts and a reduced demand for gypsum products.
   However, good demand from home improvement and industrial
markets lessened the impact of the drop in housing starts.
   ``Net income was a record for the three-month period, and sales
were strong throughout the quarter,'' Hahn said. ``We are
particularly pleased with our good performance during a season when
activity is typically slower.''
   Georgia Pacific said it had good demand for its paper products
during the quarter.

<HEAD>IC Industries Profits Up 40 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong performance by its newly expanded
Pepsi-Cola bottling operations helped IC Industries Inc. post a
nearly 41 percent increase in profits in the first quarter, the
diversified company said Wednesday.
   IC reported record first-quarter net income of $40.7 million, or
38 cents a share, compared to $28.9 million, or 26 cents a share,
in the same period of 1987.
   The profits came on record sales of just over $1 billion
compared to $900.5 million in 1987, the Chicago-based company said
in a statement.
   Pet Inc., IC's specialty foods subsidiary, accounted for more
than a third of the company's revenues for the quarter.
   But Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers Inc., a subsidiary that was
expanded late last year through a joint venture with Pepsico Inc.,
showed the greatest improvement. Sales for the division increased
51.4 percent to $186.4 million and operating income was up nearly
140 percent, at $22.4 million, due to improved operating margins,
IC said.
   IC also owns muffler-and-brake specialist Midas International
Corp., aircraft parts maker Pneumo Abex Corp., food-service
equipment manufacturer Hussman Corp. and the Illinois Central
Railroad, which it is in the process of spinning off as a separate
company.
   The results included a gain of $23.7 million, or 22 cents a
share, from an accounting adjustment made to conform with a change
in income tax laws. That was largely offset by a $19.6 million loss
at Illinois Central, which is reported as a discontinued operation.
Although the railroad had an operating profit, there was a special
pre-tax charge of $35 million to cover a downsizing and
cost-reduction programs.

<HEAD>Morgan Reports Jump In Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   J.P. Morgan & Co. reported Wednesday that its first-quarter
profit jumped 24 percent from a year ago, and the chairman of the
nation's fifth largest banking company expressed cautious optimism
about the rest of 1988.
   ``After the difficulties of 1987, the new year has begun on a
more optimstic note,'' Chairman Lewis T. Preston said at the
company's annual shareholders' meeting.
   For the three months ended March 31, Morgan said it netted
$281.4 million, or $1.52 a share, compared with earnings of $226.4
million, or $1.22 a share, the same time a year ago.
   The increase reflected several factors, including higher net
interest income and corporate finance-related fees, which more than
offset an increase in non-interest operating expenses and in its
loan-loss provision.
   Non-interest operating income during the quarter totaled $435.2
milion, up from $336.8 million. But non-interest expenses also rose
sharply, to $444.1 million from $371.1 million.
   Interest income increased to $1.42 billion from $1.30 billion,
while interest expenses also rose, to $438.2 million from $383.0
million.
   Morgan said that during the quarter it raised its provision to
cover troubled loans, including those from Third World countries
like Brazil, to $50 million from $35 million.
   Last spring, Morgan and other major banks made hefty additions
to their loan-loss reserves after Brazil imposed a temporary
moratorium on interest payments on its international debt. The
banks had hoped to safeguard themselves against possible future
losses.
   Preston told shareholders that while the Brazilian government
has since resumed partial payment of interest on its debt, he was
also optimistic about current negotiations on restructuring that
country's debt.
   ``We remain convinced that the developing countries' debt
problems cannot be solved by any single action or institition,'' he
said. ``The situation of each country and each creditor is
different.
   ``The starting point for any solution is structural economic
reform in the developing countries.''
   Achieving ``significant progress'' in that direction has been
Mexico, Preston said.
   Earlier this year, Morgan's principal subsidiary, Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co., sponsored a debt-swap program aimed at helping
reduce that country's $105 billion foreign debt. The plan called
for Mexico to issue new 20-year bonds, back by U.S. Treasury
securities, in exchange for old bank debt.
   ``The Mexican loan exchange was not intended as a panacea for
the LDC (less developed country) debt problem, but we believe it
was useful effort that will lead to other approaches,'' Preston
said.
   Besides the Third World debt crisis, he said, Morgan and the
banking industry faced a myriad of other problems during 1987,
including the Oct. 19 stock market crash that followed a sharp rise
in interest rates.
   ``The heartening fact is that the world financial system, and
Morgan, have weathered these shocks rather well,'' Preston told
shareholders. ``The crash itself has been much less harmful effect
on the economy than had been commonly feared.''

<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owens-Illinois said Wednesday it had
completed its merger with Brockway Inc., creating the nation's
largest glass container company.
   Toledo-based Owens-Illinois said integration of the companies'
operations had been under way for several weeks. Completion of the
merger ended a process that began last September and has so far
survived a challenge by the Federal Trade Commission.
   On Feb. 29, a subsidiary of Owens-Illinois completed the
acquisition of more than 98 percent of Brockway's shares
outstanding for about $740 million. That followed a decision by the
government against appealing a court decision in favor of the
merger.
   Each common share of Brockway still outstanding will be
converted to $60 in cash, Owens-Illinois said.
   Robert Lanigan, chairman of Owens-Illinois, has said the merger
will make the combined operations and the glass container industry
``significantly more competitive with can, plastic and other
materials in the worldwide packaging business.''
   The FTC had attempted in court to block the merger, saying it
might violate antitrust laws by substantially reducing competition
and creating the conditions for price discrimination.
   However, U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green denied the FTC's
request for a preliminary injunction on the basis that the agency
had failed to prove the deal would harm competition. A federal
appeals court sided with Judge Green, saying the FTC had failed to
make its case.
   The FTC has scheduled administrative hearings on potential
anticompetitive effects of the merger. And spokeswoman Susan
Ticknor said Owens-Illinois could be ordered to divest itself of
Brockway holdings if the agency determines that the merger violates
antitrust laws.
   Brockway, of Jacksonville, Fla., had sales of nearly $1.1
billion last year; Owens-Illinois had sales of more than $3 billion.

<HEAD>Gillette Reports 37 Percent Increase In Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co., under pressure from an investment
group, Wednesday credited streamlined global operations and a jump
in sales of some products for a 37 percent increase in
first-quarter earnings.
   Gillette management has been urging the company's nearly 27,000
shareholders to reject an attempt by New York-based Coniston
Partners to oust four Gillette directors at the April 21 annual
meeting in Andover.
   For the three months ended March 31, Gillette reported earnings
of $75.3 million, or 65 cents a share, on sales of $903.1 million,
compared with earnings of $55 million, or 48 cents a share, on
sales of $762.1 million for the same period last year.
   Pre-tax income from operations for the first quarter rose 30
percent to $124.9 million, compared with $96 million for the same
period in 1987.
   Razor blades, personal care items and Braun electric shavers all
sold well in the latest quarter, said Gillette spokesman David
Fausch.
   Colman M. Mockler Jr., Gillette's chairman and chief executive,
predicted 1988 earnings will increase at least 25 percent to about
$2.50 a share, compared with $2 a share for 1987 and $1.42 per
share in 1986.
   Gillette spent nearly $225 million restructuring in 1986 after
thwarting a third hostile takeover bid by Revlon Group Inc., which
agreed not to seek to gain control of Gillette under a 10-year pact
signed in November 1986. Following the accord, Gillette laid off
2,400 workers and sold off several unprofitable divisions.
   The two Coniston partnerships have accumulated 6.76 million
Gillette shares, or about 5.8 percent of the company's shares
outstanding.
   In several reports mailed to shareholders since March, Mockler
claimed Coniston plans to sell or dismember the company.
   A hostile takeover attempt by Coniston forced a major
restructuring of Allegis Corp. last year.
   Gillette has about 30,000 employees worldwide.

   Bank of New York Co. said Wednesday that it has
extended by nearly a week its $1.08 billion hostile tender offer
for rival Irving Bank Corp.
   The bid _ of $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of Bank of New York
stock for each of Irving's roughly 18.1 million common shares
outstanding _ is now set to expire at 2 p.m. EDT April 21. That's
the day Irving's shareholders are expected to vote on the poposal.
   The offer originally was scheduled to run out at midnight Friday.
   Irving has rejected the twice-revised Bank of New York offer as
inadequate, while maintaining its desire to remain independent.
   Bank of New York said that as of the close of business Tuesday,
35,258 Irving shares had been tendered.

   The stock market declined slightly today as
traders cashed in some of the gains from the rally of the past six
sessions.
   The market's decline came despite buying in International
Business Machines, which rose 2| to 116\.
   Analysts generally gave high marks to the company's
first-quarter results, which showed earnings at $1.53 a share, up
from $1.30 in the comparable period of 1987.
   Otherwise, however, brokers said the mood was cautious and
subdued.
   Wall Street is looking for favorable news from the meeting today
of the so-called Group of Seven industrialized countries in
Washington, and from Thursday's report by the Commerce Department
on the nation's trade balance for February.
   But many traders apparently are worried that whatever positive
stimulus comes from those sources may have been already reflected
in stock prices with the market's advance of late.
   ``We have to wonder if there will be `selling on the news' even
if the economic figures come in as expected,'' said Newton Zinder
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

<HEAD>Estimated Seabrook Start-up Date Set Back 18 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public Service Company of New Hampshire
won't flatly predict when or if its Seabrook nuclear power plant
ever will operate, but the estimate it makes for financial planning
purposes has slipped again _ to Jan. 1, 1990.
   That is 18 months later than Public Service's prior written
planning assumption, though company officials told state regulators
last year that the date had slipped at least to April 1989.
   In its annual report for 1987 filed this week with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Public Service also raises the
possibility that federal regulators would set rates if the company
emerges successfully from bankruptcy protection _ and reiterates
that rates likely would have to increase.
   Barred by state law from charging ratepayers for any of its 36
percent share of the $5.3 billion reactor before the plant operates
commercially, and unable to borrow any more money, Public Service
on Jan. 28 became the first big investor-owned utility in more than
50 years to seek bankruptcy protection.
   Company spokesman Nicholas Ashooh emphasized on Wednesday that
the new Seabrook startup assumption is not a prediction of when the
beleaguered reactor will produce electricity.
   After earlier projected startup dates repeatedly passed with
Seabrook remaining idle _ Public Service originally hoped to have
it operating commercially in 1979 _ the utility in recent years has
said it cannot predict when or if the 1,150-megawatt plant will
ever surmount evacuation-planning obstacles to a license.
   But in compiling its reports for the SEC, ``We just have to have
an estimate to make some financial planning assumptions,'' Ashooh
said.
   The company's most recent previous Seabrook startup assumption
had been July 1, though utility officials had told state regulators
during hearings on an emergency rate request last year that date
probably would be missed.
   Public Service was denied the Seabrook-related rate increase
when the state Supreme Court upheld the law that bars utilities
from charging ratepayers for power plants before they produce
electricity. Two days later the utility, New Hampshire's largest
power company, sought bankruptcy refuge.
   Public Service this month appealed the state court ruling to the
U.S. Supreme Court, hoping to increase the value of the company in
reorganzation by being allowed to charge ratepayers for Seabrook
before it operates.
   ``It is believed that some level of rate increases will be
essential to develop and implement a successful plan,'' the company
told the SEC.
   Two New England utilities have announced they are interested in
taking over Public Service's non-Seabrook assets. New England
Electric System of Massachusetts has said it envisions having New
Hampshire regulators retain ratemaking authority, while Northeast
Utilities of Connecticut has not divulged details of its takeover
plan.
   ``The (reorganization) plan could involve a sale of the company
or certain of its assets, or a split-up of the company and its
assets into two or more companies, resulting, in the latter case,
in a potential change in rate regulation to the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission,'' Public Service told the SEC.

<HEAD>Dollar Moves Higher, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Precede LONDON BC</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most of the major
foreign currencies Wednesday although most traders stayed on the
sidelines, waiting for Thursday's release of U.S. trade deficit
figures.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
late bid of $446.60 for a troy ounce of gold, down from $450.20
late Tuesday.
   Dollar traders were not making any major commitments in advance
of the trade figures, said Jack Barbanel, a first vice president
with Gruntal & Co. in New York.
   The trade deficit has affected the dollar's direction in recent
months because the Reagan administration has supported a lower
dollar as a way of narrowing the gap.
   A better-than-expected figure could boost the dollar Thursday.
The market was expecting the February deficit to fall within the
range of $11.2 billion to $11.8 billion, Barbanel said.
   Traders were especially looking for signs of improvement in U.S.
exports, Barbanel said.
   The foreign exchange markets also were waiting to see what would
transpire at the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of
Seven major industrial nations. No announcements came out of the
Washington gathering by the time the markets closed in New York.
The ministers were discussing the dollar and other economic issues.
   The dollar was down against the Japanese yen. In Tokyo, the
dollar dipped 0.05 yen to a closing 126.45 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 126.30 yen and in New York, it slipped to 126.44
yen from 126.685 yen.
   Barbanel attributed the dollar's slippage against the yen to the
ripple effects from trading between the Japanese currency and the
British pound.
   One British pound cost $1.8445 in London, cheaper for buyers
than late Tuesday's $1.8515. In later New York trading, sterling
slipped to $1.83755 from $1.8468.
   Other late dollar rates in New York Wednesday, compared with
late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.6950 West German marks, up from

   In earlier London trading, bullion was sold at a bid price of
$449.25 a troy ounce, down from late Tuesday's $451.
   Traders said trading was lackluster in Europe because most
participants have squared their positions ahead of the release of
the U.S. trade figures.
   In Zurich, gold's bid price was $449.50 an ounce, down from $451
late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.39 to close at a
bid $450.82.
   Silver slipped to $6.325 a troy ounce on the Comex in New York,
down from $6.425 late Tuesday. In London, silver was quoted at a
bid price of $6.41 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.45.

   The stock market took a backward step Wednesday
as traders cashed in some of the gains from the rally of the past
six sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 129 points
over the last six trading days, slipped 2.98 to 2,107.10.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 4 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 666 up, 829 down and 493 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 185.12 million shares, against 140.40
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index edged
up .01 to 153.20.
   The market's decline came despite buying in International
Business Machines, which rose 2{ to 116[.
   Analysts generally gave high marks to the company's
first-quarter results, which showed earnings at $1.53 a share, up
from $1.30 in the comparable period of 1987.
   Otherwise, however, brokers said the mood was cautious and
subdued.
   Wall Street was looking for favorable news from the meeting
today of the so-called Group of Seven industrialized countries in
Washington, and from Thursday's report by the Commerce Department
on the nation's trade balance for February.
   But many traders apparently are worried that whatever positive
stimulus comes from those sources may have been already reflected
in stock prices with the market's advance of late.
   ``We have to wonder if there will be `selling on the news' even
if the economic figures come in as expected,'' said Newton Zinder
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   IBM's showing helped produce a modest echo effect in some of the
other prominent computer and technology issues. Digital Equipment
added } to 108], and Hewlett-Packard was up ~ at 64{.
   Pfizer gained 3\ to 60[, apparently benefiting from takeover
rumors and speculation.
   Federal National Mortgage rose 1] to 35\. The company reported
first-quarter earnings of $1.28 a share, up from 76 cents in the
like period last year. Fannie Mae warrants jumped } to 8| to rank
among the day's best percentage gainers.
   Hospital Corp. of America, which said its first-quarter profits
came in above analysts' expectations, climbed 2\ to 36.
   Auto stocks were mixed as the industry posted a 10.8 percent
decline in early-April domestic car sales. Chrysler rose [ to 24},
but Ford Motor dropped [ to 47[ and General Motors was down ] at
75].
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 129 points
over the last six trading days, slipped back 2.98 to 2,107.10.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $0.07 billion, or 0.003
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 210.23 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .33 to 316.49, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .18 at 271.55.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained .03 to 383.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 305.79, down .80.

   Oil prices were little changed Wednesday, but
analysts were heartened that the market had no trouble holding at
higher levels after an impressive two-day rally.
   Contract prices for unleaded gasoline posted a modest gain,
while crude and heating oils were fractionally higher.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May delivery
of West Texas Intermediate crude, which jumped $1.21 a barrel in
the last two sessions, rose 2 cents to settle at $18.12 a barrel.
   Oil prices had not traded above the $18-a-barrel level since
last December.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .35 cent a gallon to close at
52.42 cents, and heating oil rose .11 cent a gallon to close at
49.02 cents.
   ``The market was exceptional simply because it had been expected
to fall'' after the sharp, two-day run-up, said Bob Baker, a senior
energy analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Reports of higher U.S. inventories and some profit taking took
crude below $18 a barrel in early trading, but prices soon moved
higher and held in a narrow range.
   ``The market couldn't be depressed,'' said Richard Kane, a
trader at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``There's good underlying
support.''
   Echoing that sentiment, Baker said the market ``showed
surprising resilience.''
   Analysts anticipate little change in oil prices between now and
April 23, when a number of non-OPEC exporters are scheduled to meet
to discuss coordinated strategies for reducing output and forcing
prices up.
   News that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had
invited eight nations to participate in the meeting was a key
factor in sparking the rally earlier in the week.
   The impending meeting will ``keep the market in a
sideways-to-upward momentum until we have some solid evidence on
supply,'' Kane said.
   Analysts expect the market to be pelted with rumors until the
meeting actually takes place. ``It will be a psychological battle''
until then, Baker said.
   Reports that 100 U.S. Marines clashed with unidentified
intruders at a military fuel tank farm in a Panamanian jungle had
no effect on trading.
   In the previous session, however, the market advanced when the
fatal shooting of a Marine who was guarding a petroleum storage
area on a U.S. military base in Panama sparked rumors that a
crucial trans-Panama oil pipeline would shut down.

<HEAD>International Paper Offers Contract Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Paper Co. presented
contract proposals Wednesday to the United Paperworkers
International Union in an effort to settle bitter labor disputes at
four facilities.
   International Paper spokesman William Greener said the union was
evaluating the proposals, but both sides agreed not to discuss any
details until the plans are presented to local memberships.
   Wayne E. Glenn, international president of the union, said in a
statement issued from its Nashville, Tenn., headquarters, that the
next step would be to take the proposals to the membership. No time
frame was announced.
   When negotiations got underway March 28, International Paper
said it hoped to defuse hostility between management and labor and
to set up a framework for pursuing the company's labor problems on
a local level.
   About 3,500 workers in four locations are affected by the
contract disputes. In Mobile, Ala., 1,200 workers have been locked
out of their jobs, while an additional 2,300 workers have struck
plants in Jay, Maine, Lock Haven, Pa., and DePere, Wis.
   The International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers represents
some workers at the Maine facility, where the contract proposals
also would apply. Contracts also are open in Pine Bluff and Camden,
Ark., and Natchez, Miss.
   International Paper and its unions have been at odds for more
than a year over contracts that have come up for renewal. At the
heart of the disagreement is the issue of whether local contracts
should restore premium pay for Sundays and holidays.
   Premium pay had been eliminated with labor's approval from past
contracts, but an improved financial picture for the industry in
the last year prompted the unions to campaign to revive the benefit.
   International Paper has continued to operate its mills with
replacement workers. The company has claimed throughout the dispute
that strike-breakers were permanent employees and offered
assistance to strikers who wanted to re-enter the job market,
including positions at other company mills.
   International Paper, based in Purchase, N.Y., earned $407
million in 1987, but the company said its profitablity was below
the industry average.

<HEAD>Government May Pay to Shed Great Plain Coal Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government admitted Wednesday that
it might wind up paying somebody to take the Great Plains coal
gassification plant in North Dakota off its hands.
   Allen Wampler, assistant secretary of energy for fossil energy,
told a House subcommittee the Energy Department would insist on a
fair value for the plant and a commitment by the buyer to keep it
operating, or it wouldn't sell.
   But Wampler declined to say whether the department would insist
on at least a theoretical ``retention value'' for the plant, a
value that congressional investigators estimated at about $1
billion.
   ``We're not going to sell if it doesn't make sense to do it from
the standpoint of fair value and the assurance of continued
operation,'' Wampler told the energy and power subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the subcommittee, called
the hearings to explore whether the administration was about to
engage in a ``giveaway'' of the $2 billion plant that the
department took over in 1985 when its sponsors defaulted on $1.6
billion in government loans.
   The plant near Beulah, planned in the near-panic energy hunts of
the late 1970s, has been a technical success. It produces more than
140 million cubic feet of synthetic natural gas per day from
lignite, selling it under 25-year contracts to four pipelines.
   The contract price is tied to the price of heating oil. Recently
the pipelines have been paying $3.96 per million BTUs of gas,
roughly 1,000 cubic feet, while the average wellhead price is about
$1.75.
   The plant has been running an operational surplus of about $50
million a year, though not charging for depreciation.
   In two years the contracts will change to a price just below the
most expensive 10 percent of gas purchased by the pipelines.
   The congressional General Accounting Office reported that net
revenues from the project through the year 2009, using private
forecaster assumptions on future natural gas prices, had a
theoretical value of $569 million _ in other words, a buyer would
pay that now in exchange for all the future net revenues.
   If a private buyer is eligible for production tax credits
granted by Congress in 1980 as an incentive, the government's sale
price would have to be about $1 billion to realize a net gain of
$569 million. This makes $1 billion the ``retention value'' _ the
point where the government is equally well off selling the plant or
keeping it.
   To avoid jeopardizing negotiations with eight potential buyers,
the department has not stated what price it expects. The
congressional investigators said they were respecting that secrecy
and, ``It is therefore very important to keep in mind that we did
not estimate the present value of the project's future cash flow to
a private investor and that our hypothetical sale prices does not
represent our judgment on the project's market value.''
   Wampler said the administration philosophically favored a sale
because there is ``no prevailing reason for the government to
operate a gas plant.''
   Asked by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., whether the department would
sell if the selling price were below theoretical value, Wampler
replied, ``I can't answer that. I don't know if I would or not.''
Pressed then on whether he would be ``basically paying somebody to
take this off your hands,'' Wampler replied, ``With the production
tax credits, yes, it would be.''

   International Business Machines Corp. and rival
Digital Equipment Corp. traded places in profits on Wednesday as
IBM announced a 16.3 percent increase in the latest quarter and
Digital reported a 0.8 percent decline.
   IBM's strong results and Digital's weaker ones came as a switch
after more than two years in which IBM was regarded as a stumbling
giant and Maynard, Mass.-based Digital as its burgeoning, main
rival.
   IBM's stock jumped $2.50 a share to $116.12{ in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading. Digital announced its results, as it
always does, after the close of the market. Its stock had risen 75
cents a share to $108.37{.
   Most encouraging in IBM's report was that revenue rose 10
percent in the first three months of 1988 compared to a year
earlier, the biggest revenue gain since an 18.4 percent rise in the
1985 fourth quarter.
   Analysts said Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM showed strength at the two
extremes of its product line: personal computers and big, mainframe
computers. That fits the pattern of the industry as a whole, said
analyst Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``It looks like there's a trend as we start out the year toward
a two-tier system,'' Stevens said.
   Digital and other companies that earn most of their money from a
middle tier of minicomputers are slowing down, Stevens said. His
comments were borne out later in the day by Digital's earnings
announcement.
   IBM's first-quarter earnings per share, $1.53, slightly exceeded
the mean analysts' estimate of $1.47 compiled by Institutional
Brokers Estimate System, a service of Lynch, Jones & Ryan brokerage
house.
   Digital's $2.33 a share was in line with forecasts that Digital
had communicated to Wall Street in an effort to prepare investors
for bad news. The company's stock had sunk last month after it
lowered its forecast from $2.70 a share to $2.50, then lowered it
again to $2.30 a share.
   IBM's earnings of $913 million were up from $785 million, or
$1.30 a share, in 1987's first quarter. Revenue rose to $11.75
billion from $10.68 billion a year earlier.
   ``We are pleased that customers are responding positively to our
strengthened product line,'' John F. Akers, IBM's chairman and
chief executive, said in a prepared statement.
   Digital's earnings in its third fiscal quarter ended March 26
totaled $305.1 million, down from $307.6 million or $2.29 a share a
year earlier. Earnings per share improved because of a reduction in
outstanding shares.
   Digital's revenue rose 17.2 percent to $2.82 billion from $2.41
billion.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Digital said its
profit rose 19 percent to $904.6 million, or $6.83 a share, from
$760.2 million, or $5.69 a share, a year earlier.
   Results at Digital would have been worse if not for sharply
lower taxes. The company's income before income taxes was $406.9
million in the latest quarter, down from $460.2 million a year
earlier.
   Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's president, issued a statement
saying: ``The company's order rate growth, while not what we
planned, continues to outpace that of the industry and is
particularly robust for workstation products.''
   Digital said demand for some of its larger computers was less
than planned because of such factors as customers' evaluation of
new products and their concern about U.S. and overseas economic
conditions.
   IBM's new Personal System-2 line benefited from an industrywide
boom in personal computer buying and the 3090 mainframe line was
helped by price cuts and performance improvements that were
announced in the first quarter, said Michael Geran, an analyst for
Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   Growth was strongest in Europe and the Far East and weakest in
the United States, he said.
   In spite of slow growth in recent years, IBM returned in 1987 to
its customary role as the nation's most profitable company. Exxon
Corp., which had usurped the top rank in 1986, fell back to No.2 in
a Forbes magazine list of 500 companies ranked by net profit.
   Sales of products other than software rose 14.3 percent, an
encouraging rise in IBM's biggest business segment. Software
revenue jumped 21.7 percent, continuing its rapid rise, while
revenue from maintenance, rentals and other services fell.
   ``Things look pretty good,'' said Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst
at Argus Research Corp. She said the gain in hardware sales was
``really exceptional.''

<HEAD>Hachette To Acquire Magazine Company in Second Big U.S.
Acquisition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French communications giant Hachette SA made
its second major venture into the U.S. publishing market this week
with an announcement Wednesday it will buy a major magazine
publisher for $712 million.
   Hachette said it had agreed to buy Diamandis Communications
Inc., a privately held concern that publishes a dozen magazines,
including Woman's Day, Car & Driver, Popular Photography, Road &
Track and Stereo Review.
   The announcement came four days after Hachette reached an
agreement to buy Grolier Inc., the Danbury, Conn.-based book
publisher, for $450 million.
   Hachette, which is based in Paris, has interests in television,
radio, magazines and book publishing.
   In conjunction with Publications Filipacchi, Hachette publishes
74 magazines in 10 languages that sell 650 million copies annually.
   It said the acquisition of Diamandis would give the
Hachette-Filipacchi organization revenue of $1.9 billion this year,
rivaling Time Inc. for the title of the biggest magazine publisher
in thw world. Time reported $1.6 billion in magazine revenue in
1987 but has made no projection for 1988.
   Diamandis was formed in October when it acquired the magazine
division of CBS Inc. for $650 million in cash.
   The buyers in that deal included the management of the CBS
magazine division led by the division's president, Peter G.
Diamandis, and two merchant banking subsidiaries of Prudential
Insurance Company of America that financed the buyout and took a 70
percent stake in the new firm.
   Since the acquisition from CBS, Diamandis sold seven of its 19
original magazines, raising in excess of $232 million.
   The money from those sales combined with that from Hachette and
excess cash flow boosts total proceeds from the originally acquired
properties to more than $1 billion, Diamandis and Prudential said.
   ``Given the magnitude of the overall gain and the timeframe
involved, this has to be considered one of the most sucessful
leveraged buyouts ever undertaken,'' said Kenneth E. MacWilliams,
president and chief executive of Prudential Capital Corp., one of
the two Pudential subsidiaries.
   Analysts said the consensus when CBS sold the magazine division
was that it had gotten a good price. They said a combination of the
dollar's decline against the French franc, cost-cutting steps
undertaken since the buyout and Hachette's evident desire to expand
apparently made it worth more to Hachette.
   Hachette had talked to CBS about buying its magazine division
for $600 million before it was sold to Diamandis.
   Daniel Filipacchi, vice chairman of Hachette, acknowledged
Wednesday that Hachette had ``held some discussions with CBS'' in
July although nothing came of them.
   ``We continued to watch the company and felt that it was
becoming more and more attractive. That together with the quality
of its people decided us on the acquisition,'' he said in the
statement announcing the agreement.
   The purchase price includes $345 million for the equity in
Diamandis Communications and the retirement of $367 million in debt
that the Prudential subsidiaries arranged, Prudential spokesman
Scott Peterson said.
   Peter Diamandis said in a telephone interview that his company
was not actively seeking a buyer when it was approached by Hachette
about the possibility of selling. He said their talks took about a
month.
   Diamandis, who has signed a three-year contract to continue at
the company, said the deal gives his organization greater financial
resources to expand its publications overseas, tailor some Hachette
foreign publications to the U.S. market and start new magazines.
   Filipacchi said his company bought Diamandis Communications ``to
expand it, not sell it off in pieces.'' He said it would be ``the
nucleus for expansion'' of Hachette's activities in the United
States.
   The Hachette-Filipacchi organization entered the U.S. magazine
market in 1985 by launching an American version of the French
fashion magazine Elle in a 50-50 joint venture with Murdoch
Magazines, which is controlled by media figure Rupert Murdoch.
   It also publishes Premiere, a movie magazine in a joint venture
with Murdoch Magazines.
   The purchase of Diamandis Communications is being undertaken
through Hachette Publishing Inc., a subsidiary of Hachette's
magazine division.
   The Grolier acquisition is being made by the Hachette book
publishing division.
   Filipacchi said the deals were negotiated separately, and said
it was a coincidence that the deals ``have come so soon after one
another.''

   Staley Continental Inc. said
Tuesday that its board of directors has delayed action on a $1.33
billion cash tender offer from Tate & Lyle PLC, a major British
sugar refiner.
   Staley spokesman G. David Satterfield said the company would
announce its position on the $32-a-share offer before April 21, and
urged stockholders to postpone not to take any action until after
the board's recommendation.
   Staley, the second-largest U.S. refiner of corn sweeteners, said
its management will continue to review the Tate & Lyle offer with
legal and financial advisors.
   ``I'd like to think that the acquisition of Staley by Tate &
Lyle would be friendly,'' Tate & Lyle Chairman Neil Shaw said, at a
news conference Tuesday.
   Shaw called the offer, set to expire at midnight May 5, ``a very
good price,'' and refused to speculate about any possible change in
negotiations with Staley. Tate & Lyle owns nearly 5 percent of
Staley's stock.
   Also Tuesday, the Staley board elected Robert M. Powers as its
president and chief operating officer. Powers previously served as
an executive vice president and has been a director of Staley
Continental since 1975.

<HEAD>Platinum, Gold Futures Sink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices fell sharply Wednesday as the dollar
gained strength ahead of Thursday's report on the U.S. trade
deficit, which many traders expected to show a lessening of the
import-export gap.
   The dollar's advance against most foreign currencies also
contributed to weakness in the other precious metals, analysts said.
   On other exchanges, soybean and grain prices fell; crude oil
futures edged higher; livestock and meat were down and stock-index
futures retreated.
   Fairly heavy selling of platinum futures by foreign investors
sparked the decline in the precious-metals complex, analysts said.
The active June gold contract cracked the psychologically important
level of $450 a troy ounce on New York's Commodity Exchange, but
buying interest then surfaced to halt the slide and held losses to
$4 to $5.
   Platinum plunged $16.30 across the board on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for delivery in July
settled at $522.80 a troy ounce.
   Expectations of a sharp reduction in the February trade deficit
from January's $12.4 billion added to the negative tone in precious
metals, said Stephen Platt, an analyst in Chicago for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   ``What traders are looking at is the dollar's strength and the
subsequent limiting of any strong investment demand by the U.S. in
precious metals if that does occur,'' Platt said.
   Working in favor of higher gold prices, however, was a drop in
supplies at Commodity Exchange warehouses, said Jerry Rothman, an
analyst at Elders Futures Inc.
   Rothman said the Comex reported warehouse stocks at 1.548 troy
ounces, down from about 2.6 million troy ounces less than two
months ago.
   The relatively tight supplies of deliverable gold stocks
indicates that ``in the longer term, the price of gold should tend
to move upwards,'' Rothman said.
   Gold settled $3.90 to $5.50 lower with June at $449.60 a troy
ounce; silver was 7.5 cents to 8.7 cents lower with May at $6.345 a
troy ounce.
   Soybean futures lost as much 9 cents a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade. The grain markets followed suit as traders took
profits amid an absence of bullish news.
   Soybeans started the day lower and plunged near the bell,
extending for a second day a selloff that follows last week's rally
caused by government reports indicating potentially tight supplies.
   The wheat market received some bullish news after the close when
the Agriculture Department announced it had targeted India for 1.2
million metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with May at $3.18\ a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower with May at $2.04} a
bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3} cents lower with May at $1.62} a
bushel; soybeans were 3} cents to 9 cents lower with May at $6.75{
a bushel.
   Crude oil moved higher on the New York Mercantile Exchanage for
the third consecutive session on rumors that the Organizaiton of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would declare their April 25 meeting
an emergency session, said Nauman Barakat of Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co. in New York.
   Such a declaration would enable the oil ministers to take action
to limit production, a prospect that appears increasingly likely,
Barakat said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 15 cents
higher with May at $18.12 a barrel; heating oil was .02 cent lower
to .11 cent higher with May at 49.02 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .31 cent to .54 cent higher with May at 52.42 cents a
gallon.
   Live cattle futures settled sharply lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange with the sentiments matched to a lesser degree
in the feeder cattle and pork pits.
   Live cattle settled 1.17 cents lower to .50 cent higher with
April at 73.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .47 cent lower to
.05 cent higher with April at 79.65 cents per pound; hogs were .37
cent to 1.28 cents lower with April at 45 cents per pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.37 cents lower to .10 cent higher with May at
51.65 cents per pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .45 point lower at 272.10. The underlying
spot index advanced .21 point to close at 271.58.

<HEAD>Raytheon First-Quarter Earnings Rise 11 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raytheon Co., one of the nation's top
government defense contractors, reported Wednesday that its fiscal
first-quarter earnings rose more than 11 percent over a year ago.
   For the three months ended April 3, Raytheon said net income
totaled $113.3 million, or $1.68 a share, on sales of $1.95
billion. That compared with earnings of $101.8 million, or $1.37 a
share, on sales $1.75 billion last year.
   Raytheon credited some of the increase to a boost in profits
from several divisions, including aircraft and electronics.
   The company attributed a 22.6 percent increase in earnings per
share to a drop in the number of shares outstanding due to a stock
repurchase program. Raytheon had 67.3 million shares outstanding
during the first quarter, compared with 74.2 shares outstanding
during the year-ago period.
   Raytheon's Wichita, Kan.-based Beech Aircraft Corp. division was
boosted by last year's introduction of the 19-seat Beech 1900
turboprop plane, which is being used by several domestic and
foreign airlines, said spokesman Larry McCracken.
   The electronics division, currently producing air-traffic
control radars for the U.S. and Canada, led the company in both
sales and profits, while the energy services division, which
produces nuclear and non-nuclear power plants, was the only segment
to report a drop in sales.
   Raytheon was ranked as the sixth largest defense contractor by
the Department of Defense for fiscal 1987, which ended Sept. 30.
The Lexington-based company was ranked seventh the previous fiscal
year, McCracken said.
   The backlog of goverment-funded orders, including the five-year
contract for the Patriot surface-to-air missile, rose from $5.20
billion in the first quarter of 1987 to $6.31 billion for the first
quarter this year.
   Total orders are presently $8.6 billion, compared to $7.52
billion for the first quarter of 1987.
   Raytheon non-defense divisions also produce text books, road
construction machinery and home appliances.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department fined a Rhode Island
company $612,000 Wednesday for what officials described as a scheme
to underreport job accidents and deny injured employees full
workmen's compensation benefits entitled them.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Collyer
Insulated Wire Co. of Lincoln, R.I., for 102 instances of
``willfully'' under-reporting or misrecording workdays that
employees lost to injuries and the medical treatments they required.
   OSHA officials cited one instance in which a worker had to have
the tip of his thumb amputated, and another in which a worker had
to have his index finger amputated.
   While both workers were off for several days,
government-required records showed them not missing any work,
according to the officials.
   Collyer, a subsidiary of the Santa Monica, Calif.-based Wickes
Cos., employs about 340 workers at the Lincoln plant.
   Officials at the plant referred questions to the parent company.
Its spokeswoman, Susan Williams, said Wickes officials would have
no comment on the OSHA charges until after they have studied the
agency's complaint.
   Under the law, the company has 15 days to either pay the fine or
contest it before a three-judge review panel.
   OSHA investigators said there were dozens of cases at the
Lincoln plant in which workers who were off because of injuries
were told to ``punch in'' for their shifts and then return home.
   ``The company called this `light duty,' but in fact these
represented lost workdays which the company did not report,'' said
Terry Mikelson, a spokesman for the agency. ``In some cases injured
employees may have collected less in pay and benefits than they
would have under workers' compensation.''
   Deputy Assistant Labor Secretary Frank White said the so-called
light-duty program effectively masked serious injuries and the
number of lost workays.
   It is lost workdays that OSHA, state agencies and insurance
companies measure in determining whether to inspect a plant and in
calculating the premiums it has to pay for workers' compensation
insurance.
   ``It was clear to us that Collyer's approach was deliberately
misleading to OSHA and posssibly to others,'' said George Salem,
the Labor Department's solicitor. ``One incentive for companies to
under-report is to keep their workmen's compensation insurance
rates low.''

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. on Wednesday said
improvements in its financial services, commercial and industries
divisions helped lift its first-quarter profit by 13.8 percent from
a year ago.
   The company said it earned $168.5 million, or $1.16 per share,
in the first three months of the year compared with $148.1 million,
or $1.03 per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 11.1 percent to $2.75 billion from
a restated $2.48 billion in the 1987 first quarter.
   The company said accounting changes exaggerated the improvements
slightly.
   Spokesman Paul B. Jones said the improvement in profits ``would
have been slightly less'' than 13.8 percent without the accounting
changes.
   Operating profits improved significantly in the financial
services, commercial and industries divisions and also improved in
electronics and broadcasting. But operating profits fell
significantly in energy and utility systems compared to a strong
1987 first quarter.
   ``I was particularly pleased by our sales and operating profit
margin improvement in the first quarter,'' said Chairman John C.
Marous. ``Sales were strong even when adjusted for recent
acquisitions. Incoming order rates were well ahead of lest year,
and our businesses are demonstrating continuing strength as we move
into 1988.''

<HEAD>Finance Ministers Agree To Stabilize Dollar; Retail Sales Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Top finance officials of seven nations announced Wednesday they
would keep working to stabilize the value of the dollar, extending
an agreement reached last December.
   In domestic economic news, the Commerce Department said retail
sales rose 0.8 percent in March and automakers said sales of
domestic cars and light trucks fell 10.8 percent in early April
compared to a year earlier.
   Stock prices retreated slightly as the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 2.98 points to 2,107.10. It was the first Dow decline
after gains of more than 129 points in six sessions.
   The finance officials, meeting in Washington, announced they
would use gold and other commodities as a way of measuring
inflation pressures, a concept long advocated by Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III.
   However, their announcement fell far short of suggesting a
return to a gold standard for currency values.
   The group consists of finance ministers and central bank leaders
from the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France,
Canada and Italy.
   The finance ministers were critical of the newly industrialized
nations of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong for not
doing enough to reduce global trade imbalances.
   The meeting was the first face-to-face encounter the top finance
leaders have had since the global crash of stock markets last
October, a selloff thaty may have been triggered partly by
squabbling among the top economic powers.
   The drop in auto sales came after three months of unexpectedly
strong results.
   ``It's the weakest period in a long time. (But) I think it's
just a hiccup,'' said David Healy, industry analyst with Drexel
Burnham Lambert in New York.
   Retail sales were helped by Easter buying at department and food
stores.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales for the month
increased by a seasonally adjusted $1.1 billion to $130.7 billion.
   It was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the largest
since December, when sales shot up 1.1 percent. Revised figures
showed sales rose 0.6 percent in February and 0.1 percent in
January.
   Ever since the October stock market crash, economists have
watched retail sales closely for signs that the consumer sector of
the economy would weaken. But more recently, some analysts have
raised fears that too much consumer demand could rekindle inflation.
   The dollar rose against most of the major foreign currencies
Wednesday although most traders stayed on the sidelines, waiting
for Thursday's release of U.S. trade deficit figures.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
late bid of $446.60 for a troy ounce of gold, down from $450.20
late Tuesday.
   A better-than-expected figure could boost the dollar Thursday.
The market was expecting the February deficit to fall within the
range of $11.2 billion to $11.8 billion.
   The dollar ended the day down to 126.44 Japanese yen in New York
compared to 126.685 yen late Tuesday.

   Whirlpool Corp. said Wednesday its
first-quarter earnings dropped 31.8 percent despite a 9.7 percent
sales increase.
   The company cited higher costs of parts and materials, higher
interest expense and lower earnings by Brazilian affiliates.
   Whirlpool reported cits earnings for the three months ended
March 31 fell to $33.2 million, or 48 cents a share, from $48.7
million, or 66 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1987.
   Consolidated net sales for the three months were $1.05 billion,
up from $961 million in the 1987 first quarter.
   The company cited a 7 percent increase in appliance shipments
with particularly strong sales of automatic washers and
refrigerators.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Post Small Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices overcame some early weakness to
finish with small gains Wednesday as traders looked toward an
impending report on the nation's trade balance.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond rose [ point, or $1.25 per $1,000 in
face amount, as its yield slipped to 8.73 percent from 8.75 percent
late Tuesday.
   Maury Harris, chief economist for the investment firm
PaineWebber Inc., said trading was limited mostly to professional
speculators rather than investors and was relatively light.
   He said some traders were reluctant to take a large position in
advance of Thursday's announcement of U.S. trade deficit figures
for February.
   The prices of some long-term Treasury issues initially declined
as much as $5 for every $1,000 in face value after the government
reported an 0.8 percent rise in retail sales in March, somewhat
higher than many analysts had expected.
   The report depressed bond prices because it suggested the
economy may be continuing to grow at a vigorous pace, raising
concerns that inflation and interest rates could be headed higher
to the detriment of bond prices.
   But bond prices bounced back later in the day as commodity
prices continued to fall, indicating that inflation may pose no
imminent threat.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
issues rose 2-32 point, intermediates edged up 3-32 point and
20-year governments rose 7-32 points, according to the financial
information service Telerate Inc.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, rose 0.13 to 111.76. The Shearson Lehman composite
index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 1.27 to 1,169.03.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.65 to to 282.40.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell 8 basis points to 5.83
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills fell 4 basis points to 6.04 percent and one-year
bills fell 4 basis points to 6.41 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 6| percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index,
which meaures price changed of 40 long-term bonds, rose 6-32 point
to 88 22-32 while its yield fell to 8.09 percent from 8.11 percent.

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mead Corp. said Wednesday its first-quarter
profit nearly doubled due to improving prices and supply conditions
in the paper industry.
   Mead earned $65.8 million, or $1.01 per share, for the quarter
ended April 3 compared with $34.2 million, or 55 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   The latest results included a 17 cent-per-share gain from sale
of Mead's recycled paperboard business.
   First-quarter sales rose to slightly more than $1 billion from
$957 million in 1987.
   Burnell R. Roberts, chairman and chief executive, said
production has reached record levels, but backlogs continue to
increase in some product lines and prices continue to improve.
   Demand for Mead's coated paperboard also remains strong, the
announcement said. The company is moving more heavily into that
value-added packaging line by selling some of its traditional
corrugated cardboard box plants and building a $500 million
expansion to its existing coated paperboard mill in Phenix City,
Ala.
   Favorable foreign exchange rates have helped Mead's
international sales, and sales of Mead Data Central, its electronic
publishing subsidiary, also were up substantially over 1987's first
quarter, the company said.

<BYLINE>PECO Stockholders Hammer Dissidents' Bid to Stop Limerick
^By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philadelphia Electric Co. stockholders on
Wednesday overwhelmingly rejected a dissident move to cancel the
utility's costly Limerick II nuclear power plant as protesters
demonstrated outside on stilts.
   Limerick I, located on the Schuylkill River 20 miles northwest
of Philadelphia, has been operating for nearly two years and its
controversial twin tower is 85 percent complete.
   Stockholders defeated the Limerick resolution, with 88 percent
voting against it and 12 percent in favor.
   About 500 stockholders of more than 295,000 who own shares
attended the annual meeting where about 30 people, many walking on
stilts and with animal masks on their heads, demonstrated outside.
Protesters carried signs that read, ``Stop Limerick,'' ``Nuke Power
We All Lose'' and ``Just Say No to Nukes.''
   Protesters also criticized PECO's Peach Bottom nuclear plant on
the Susquehanna River near York, Pa., which the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission temporarily closed a year ago after control-room workers
were found sleeping on the job.
   Both plants have been costly to PECO, with the Peach Bottom
shutdown costing the company $5 million a month and Limerick II
having $1 billion in cost overruns.
   Corbin A. McNeill, Jr., PECO's executive vice president-nuclear,
told stockholders the utility hopes to reopen Peach Bottom before
the end of this year and load nuclear fuel into the Limerick II
reactor by August 1989.
   J. Andy Smith III, director of the American Baptist Church's
National Ministries Investment Program, for the ninth consecutive
year introduced a resolution aimed at cancelling Limerick.
   ``We are following the guidance of the policy of the General
Board of American Baptist Churches that utilities place a hold on
nuclear plants until they can be safely constructed and operated
and the waste permanently disposed,'' he said.
   Citing Peach Bottom's management problems, Smith said he ``had
serious doubts about the ability of PECO to operate any nuclear
plant.''

<HEAD>Women in Management Leads to Lively Discussion at Editors' Meeting</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 6th graf pvs, bgng: The discussion, to include estimate
of number of editors attending; ADDS 4 grafs with discussion of
urban problems</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Editors from some of the nation's leading
newspapers on Wednesday debated the best way to get more women into
management positions, with recommendations ranging from promoting
women over more qualified men to simply giving women
important-sounding titles.
   Benjamin Bradlee, executive editor of The Washington Post,
generated lively discussion when he made a wry suggestion that
newspapers could include women in their mastheads _ the list of top
management people usually run on editorial pages _ even if the
women don't make key decisions.
   ``The creative use of mastheads is a well-known solution to
personnel problems,'' he said.
   To that Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman responded: ``Ben,
you've just devalued the prize.''
   And Marlene Sanders, an author and host of a PBS television
show, ``Currents,'' said, ``Expanding the masthead is phony
solution. People know who has the power.''
   The discussion opened a series of panels and seminars scheduled
during the three-day annual convention of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, which featured a luncheon address by President
Reagan. An estimated 685 editors are attending the convention.
   Minority hiring also was a topic. Arnold Rosenfeld, editor of
the Austin (Texas) American-Statesman, delivered an ASNE report
that showed a slow growth in the past year in the number of black,
Hispanic, Asian and American Indian on newspaper staffs.
   The rate went from 6.56 percent last year to 7.02 percent,
Rosenfeld said. ``Obviously, much needs to be done,'' he said.
   Linda Grist Cunningham, editor of the Trenton (N.J.) Times,
reported on a survey of journalists that found ``The people who
gather and process the news today are predominantly white and male,
but women and minorities are gaining in numbers.
   ``Nearly everybody is college-educated and most are under 36
years old. There is considerable mobility in and out of
newspapering and from one newspaper to another. The prevailing
outlook is liberal. Pay remains an issue,'' she said.
   Of special interest to the editors, she said, was the finding
that staff members ``give us dismal ratings for management skills.
Eighty-five percent of our staff say our weaknesses lie in our
inability to work with people, our failure to encourage them and
provide helpful feedback and our weakness in making assignments and
decisions.''
   But the panel discussion of women in the newsroom, called ``If
Women Are Doing So Well, Where Are They on Your Masthead?''
attracted the most attention from editors attending the convention.
   Early in the discussion, moderator Charles Ogletree, a Harvard
University law professor, asked the panel whether they would
promote a woman into a top management position if that post had
just been vacated by the only woman in a command post.
   Philadelphia Inquirer Executive Editor Eugene Roberts said he
would put another woman in the job. Charlotte Observer Editor
Richard Oppel agreed.
   ``I don't like designating a woman's seat,'' Oppel said, ``but I
would not step back from appointing a woman. That's affirmative
action. ... Sometimes you need a push.''
   Ogletree then asked if the editors would consider promoting a
woman over three more qualified men.
   Oppel said he still would promote the woman because ``I want to
see women filling management jobs.''
   But Bob Herbert, a member of the editorial board and a columnist
for the New York Daily News, said, ``You're not going to address
the situation by appointing one black or one woman.''
   Kay Mills, author of ``A Place in the News: From the Women's
Pages to the Front Page,'' agreed that newspaper management has to
make a full-scale commitment to hiring and promoting women and
minorities.
   ``People tend to hire people like themselves,'' Mills said.
``It's a clone factor. Affirmative action at least reduces that
clone factor. But it's a commitment at the top'' that brings
change, she said.
   Bradlee suggested one way a manager could show his commitment to
hiring women and minorities is ``make sure that for every vacancy
you get a list of women and minorities interviewed for the job.''
   Claude Sitton, editorial director of the Raleigh (N.C.) News &
Observer and Times, said another way to demonstrate the commitment
is that ``you spot a promising woman reporter and send her to
management training sessions to help her along.''
   In the afternoon, discussion centered on the news media and
coverage of changes in cities in the two decades since a national
commission on civil disorders, known as the Kerner Commission,
warned that America ``is moving toward two societies, one black,
one white.''
   Former New York Mayor John Lindsay, who was vice chairman of the
commission, said blacks and other minorities have made major
strides in the intervening years but said, ``there are still miles
to go.''
   Lindsay criticized the Reagan administation for doing nothing to
erase the economic differences between blacks. ``We probably have a
worse problem now in relations between whites and blacks.''
   Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode said newspapers do a better
job now in reporting the plight of the poor, but added that
newspapers often fall short in explaining the rise in black
political power in cities and in putting urban problems into a
national context.

   Top finance officials of the world's seven
major industrial powers, putting on a show of unity to reassure
financial markets, agreed Wednesday to continue efforts to
stabilize the value of the dollar.
   The group, consisting of finance ministers and central bank
leaders from the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Canada and Italy, issued a statement announcing the
extension of a Dec. 22 agreement that has so far successfully
halted the greenback's three-year decline.
   The two-page joint communique followed a full day of private
meetings hosted by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   The statement also announced the adoption of an innovative
suggestion made by Baker last September to use gold and other
commodities as a way of measuring inflation pressures.
   In addition, the finance ministers were critical of the newly
industrialized nations of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong
Kong for not doing enough to reduce global trade imbalances.
   The meeting was the first face-to-face encounter the top finance
leaders have had since the global crash of stock markets last
October, a selloff triggered partly by squabbling among the top
economic powers.
   Mindful of investors' continued uneasiness at any signs of
disunity, the finance leaders went out of their way in their joint
statement to emphasize their strong desire to cooperate with each
other in keeping the global economy from toppling into a recession.
   The statement reaffirmed a Dec. 22 agreement that had been
issued after long-distance discussions in which the seven countries
pledged to work together to keep the dollar from falling further
against major currencies.
   The statement said the nations ``expressed their determination
to continue to coordinate economic policies to strengthen
underlying fundamentals.''
   ``The general feeling is that the economies of the various
countries are performing well,'' Canadian Finance Minister Michael
Wilson said at the conclusion of the session.
   The upbeat tone, in the view of most analysts, is justified.
Growth is higher this year than had been expected and the threat of
a global recession caused by the market crash has receded.
   While the United States is still running a large trade deficit,
the imbalance has been slowly improving in recent months.
   The seven nations adopted an American proposal to urge Taiwan,
South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong to ``accept greater
responsibility'' in correcting large trade imbalances by making
further efforts to reduce trade barriers and to allow their
currencies to appreciate more.
   All four countries had large trade surpluses with the United
States last year, accounting for almost one-fourth of this nation's
record $171 billion trade deficit.
   The statement also said the seven nations had agreed to develop
a commodity price index as an additional economic barometer the
countries will use to help them to coordinate policy goals.
   The statement set no deadline for when the index would first be
used. There were also not details provided of what commodities
would be included.
   At the group's last meeting in September, Baker had caught other
finance ministers by surprise when he first suggested the use of
gold and other commodities as a signal of the presence or absence
of inflationary pressures.
   Baker has stressed that the proposal is not a first step back
toward a gold standard, the system by which currencies were
stabilized for a quarter-century following World War II.
   French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, briefing reporters
after the meeting, said that the commodities to be included in the
index were still to be decided. While no timetable was set for
completion of the study, Balladur said he expected Baker's proposal
would be reviewed again in mid-June at the economic summit in
Toronto.
   The joint statement was generally in line with what economists
and financial investors had been expecting.
   ``I think they realize that if anything would be
counterproductive at the current time it would be renewed
squabbling,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources
Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   The dollar has risen in recent days on currency markets in
anticipation of the unity statement. Analysts cautioned, however,
that those gains could be quickly lost if a report to be issued
Thursday shows that the U.S. trade deficit for February was
unexpectedly large.
   The administration and its allies launched in effort in
September 1985 to push the dollar lower as a way of reducing
America's trade deficits and heading off protectionist moves in
Congress.
   The administration publicly renounced further efforts to weaken
the dollar in February 1987 in an agreement with its allies known
as the Louvre accord. In that agreement, the major economies
pledged to work to support the dollar's value at then-current
levels.
   Despite that pact, the dollar continued falling for much of
1987, pushed down by financial markets which feared that steadily
worsening monthly trade figures would force the administration to
work for a weaker dollar, despite public assurances to the contrary.
   The falling dollar raised fears in the United States about
renewed inflation and prompted the Federal Reserve last September
to hike interest rates.
   After the Oct. 19 stock market plunge raised fears of a possible
global recession, the economic powers issued the Dec. 22 pledge
reaffirming their commitment to stabilize the dollar. They backed
up that pledge with massive intervention in currency markets, the
process by which countries buy a weak currency such as the dollar
to prop up its value.
   The meetings of the seven top industrial countries were taking
place during sessions of the 151-nation Internatinal Monetary Fund
and World Bank.

   New York Times Co. reported an 11 percent gain
in first-quarter earnings Wednesday, attributing the improvement
largely to strong performances in its broadcasting and
forest-product divisions that offset weakness in newspaper and
magazine advertising.
   Separately, McClatchy Newspapers, publisher of the Sacramento
Bee and 11 other newspapers, reported its first quarter profit rose
33 percent over the same period last year.
   New York Times said its earnings for the three months ended
March 31 totaled $45.5 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with
$41.1 million, or 50 cents a share, in the 1987 first quarter.
Revenue totaled $430.4 million, vs. $409 million, a 5 percent gain.
   The company owns the New York Times, 35 regional newspapers, a
one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune and a group
of magazines.
   It also owns a cable television station and radio station in New
York, TV stations in five other cities and interests in several
pulp and paper operations.
   The company said earnings in the newspaper group declined
slightly despite higher revenue, which it attributed largely to
increased costs. The magazine group's earnings also decreased
because of what the company called repositioning costs associated
with Family Circle and development costs of Child, Decorating
Remodeling, Southern Travel and Snow Country.
   The broadcasting-cable TV group's earnings strengthened in the
quarter because of higher cable subscription prices, while the
forest products unit's earnings grew sharply becuase of higher
paper prices, the company said.
   Sacramento, Calif.-based McClatchy Newspapers reported a first
quarter profit of $4.44 million, or 16 cents per share, up from
$3.34 million, or 13 cents per share, in the same period last year.
   Total revenue for the quarter rose to $82.7 million from $75.3
million in the same period last year.
   The company attributed the gains to advertising and circulation
increases at the Sacramento Bee and Modesto Bee, but said the gains
were partially offset by increased newsprint and payroll costs.
   The McClatchy group also publishes nine other newspapers in
California, Washington and Alaska.

   The Senate Wednesday night voted
overwhelmingly to expand its budget for the war on drugs even
though that would bust the spending limits in last fall's
deficit-reduction agreement with President Reagan.
   A pair of anti-drug amendments were approved after the Senate
kicked aside two days of arguments about truth-in-budgeting that
had been dominating debate on its $1.1 trillion blueprint for
fiscal 1989. Leaders said a final vote on the budget would be
Thursday.
   The Senate first approved 76-18 an amendment calling for cutting
government travel accounts by $125 million to finance new federal
prisons and drug law enforcement efforts.
   It then, by a vote of 93-0, added to the election-year spending
plan a $1.4 billion spending expansion in drug programs ranging
from blocking imports to treating addicts.
   The amendment, drafted by Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., would breach the limits of last fall's
deficit reduction agreement between the president and congressional
leaders because it would not cut spending elsewhere.
   However, the money could be allocated under a clause providing
for dire emergencies certified by the president and congressional
leaders. The sponsors said the increased cost could be covered by
increasing collection of debts owed the government and tax law
enforcement.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, if you have to raise additional
revenues and bust the cap, then you do it,'' D'Amato said.
   Lawmakers pointed out that the cap was not immediately broken,
because the revenues would be put aside and not spent unless the
president and congressional leaders certified there was an
emergency, and enabling legislation were passed.
   The Senate had been ensnarled since Monday in a debate over
whether surpluses in the Social Security system and other federal
trust funds masked the extent of the deficit problem.
   The budget claims a deficit of $136 billion in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. But it would be about $220 billion if trust fund
earnings weren't counted.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., proposed
that the Senate go on record opposed to counting against the
deficit the Social Security surpluses being built up now to be
spent for future retirees.
   Other senators then loaded on amendments covering trust funds
for aviation, road-building, the Postal Service, military
retirement, and the banking system.
   After the accounting issue threatened to put the Senate into a
stall, Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., won a substitute amendment.
It referred the issue to the new National Economic Commission,
which will be examining deficit issues over the next year.
   Last fall's budget agreement set overall spending levels for the
military, foreign aid, and domestic agencies.
   In meeting those caps, outside of the new drug spending, the
Senate plan cut spending on some subsidies and for development and
transportation. However, it also included big increases in spending
in selected areas. Those include:
   _A 27 percent increase in the space program, 11 percent more for
National Science Foundation research aid, and money to start work
on the proposed superconducting super collider nuclear physics
project.
   _A 19 percent boost for aviation safety, including hiring more
air traffic controllers and modernizing equipment.
   _An increase of 7.4 percent for education programs.
   The Pentagon, under the budget agreement, would spend $294
billion, and $16.1 billion would be spent on foreign aid.
   There were no tax increases included, beyond the $14 billion
enacted last december under the agreement.
   The Senate and House must agree on a single budget resolution
before it becomes final. The budget, which does not require the
president's signature, becomes Congress' internal guideline for its
fiscal legislation.
   Although this year's budget resolutions are similar because of
the deficit agreement, the House and Senate disagree on some
priorities.
   The House plan would provide more money for development programs
and less for the space program. The House also voted for a 3
percent pay raise for all federal employees, while the Senate
adopted Reagan's proposal to give the military 4.3 percent and
civilian workers 2 percent.

<HEAD>Aggressive Lorenzo Built Texas Air Into Major Carrier</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Texas Air-Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank A. Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp.,
often has said one of his major goals was to solve problems
connected with consolidating several airlines and winning back
disaffected customers.
   His task took on new dimensions after the Transportation
Department's announcement Wednesday that it was investigating Texas
Air's finances and management to determine whether the troubled
airline was fit to carry commercial traffic.
   Lorenzo was traveling Wednesday, and was not available to be
interviewed by reporters, said Texas Air spokesman Bruce Hicks.
   Lorenzo, 47, spent more than a decade building Texas Air Corp.
into one of world's largest and most aggressive airline companies,
acquiring such carriers as Continental Airlines, Eastern Airlines,
New York Air, Frontier Airlines, People Express and smaller
commuter airlines.
   Texas Air's airlines now serve nearly one-fifth of the U.S.
commercial airline market.
   But along the way came major problems with coordinating computer
systems, flight schedules, work forces, often bitter
union-management relations and customer defection to other carriers.
   Texas Air has said problems in consolidating several airlines
were unavoidable, and that by acquiring other carriers in many
cases it was helping them stay in business.
   After a bitter takeover battle in 1981, Lorenzo merged
Continental with his smaller, regional carrier called Texas
International Airlines. But by mid-1983, the new carrier was losing
money heavily. Lorenzo took Continental to bankruptcy court, later
emerging with a non-union airline.
   But the losses continued, with Texas Air sustaining a company
record loss of $466 million last year.
   In an interview aired last week on ABC's 20@20, Lorenzo said he
hoped to create the airline of the future.
   ``Our mission today is to put together and continue the process
of smoothing out what has been put together, and to bring to the
consumer what the consumer demands and create the airline for the
1990s,'' Lorenzo said.
   ``I can tell you that in my 16 years in this business, safety
has never taken second place,'' he said.
   Lorenzo studied economics at Columbia College, and received a
master's degree in finance from Harvard Business School in 1963. He
joined Trans World Airlines as a financial analyst in 1963 but left
two years later to become manager of Eastern's financial analysis
department. In 1966, he and Robert J. Carney, a Harvard classmate,
formed a financial advisory firm.
   Three years later, the two men founded Jet Capital Corp., which
bought a controlling interest in Texas International in August
1972, with Lorenzo becoming the carrier's youngest president ever
at age 32.
   In 1981, Texas International bought Continental for $100
million, with the resulting carrier keeping the Continental name.
Continental is now part of Texas Air, whose principal shareholder
is Jet Capital.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Reports $146 Million Third Quarter Earnings</HEAD>

   Caterpillar Inc. posted an $118 million
profit in the first quarter of 1988 compared with a loss during the
same period a year earlier, the company reported Wednesday.
   Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving
equipment, lost $84 million in first quarter 1987.
   Sales rose 42 percent to $2.35 billion in the first quarter from
$1.65 billion in the same period last year.
   The January-March results gave Caterpillar four consecutive
profitable quarters. The surging company is rebounding from a 1981
market collapse which led to three years of record losses totaling
$950 million.
   Len Kuchan, Caterpillar treasurer, attributed the company's
performance to higher-than-expected sales due to high demand for
its expanded product line. He said profits were curbed somewhat by
the new 1988 tax laws and shortages of certain popular models.
   Caterpillar sales in the United States rose 38 percent to $1.18
billion during the quarter, while foreign sales jumped 47 percent
to $1.17 billion.
   Sales fell in South America because of declining demand in
Brazil and Argentina, but sharply higher sales in Japan and the Far
East, as well as gains in Canada and Europe.
   The company suffered in the early 1980s due to a general
overcapacity in the industry and fierce competition at home and
abroad, where it was hampered by the strong U.S. dollar.
   Caterpillar has plowed its way back to financial health through
a cost-cutting program that included plant closings and widespread
layoffs.

   Billionaire real estate developer Harry Helmsley
and his wife Leona, the self-described hotel queen, have been
indicted on federal and state income tax evasion charges, a law
enforcement source said Wednesday.
   ``They were indicted several days ago,'' according to the
source, who added that federal and state prosecutors ``are just
waiting for a convenient time to hold a joint press conference.''
   The Helmsleys' lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, denied the couple ever
evaded taxes and said any such charge was ``unfounded, unfair and
unjust.''
   ``The Helmsleys have paid more taxes to the government over the
years than practically any other individual in this city or
country,'' Kaufman said in a two-page statement. ``In the last five
years alone they have paid more than $250 million in taxes.''
   The offices of the state attorney general and U.S. attorney
refused comment.
   The ailing Helmsley, 80, and his wife are accused of disguising
millions of dollars in renovation costs on their Connecticut
mansion as business expenses, according to the source, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
   The renovation bills on the sprawling Greenwich estate were
allegedly written off as tax deductions, the source said.
   The source said the expected charges were income tax evasion and
falsifying business records.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and state Attorney General Robert
Abrams mounted a joint investigation into the Helmsleys' taxes 18
months ago.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 68, who is prominent in ads for the family's
string of hotels, recently turned down a deal from prosecutors, who
said they would not seek the indictment of her husband if she
pleaded guilty to fraud, the source said.
   A problem for prosecutors will be the immunity Mrs. Helmsley
received last year in return for her testimony in cases against
merchants of expensive luxury items, including jewelry. Stores were
accused of shipping empty boxes to addresses out of state so
customers could take goods with them but avoid paying state and
city sales taxes.
   Immunity received in state cases does not apply in federal
cases, even if the federal charges stem from the same acts that
prompted the state charges, according to Paul Shechtman, chief
counsel to Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
   But federal prosecutors may not use leads and develop cases from
testimony given under immunity before a state grand jury, Shechtman
said.
   The Daily News, quoting unidentified sources close to the
defense, said Frank Turco, Mrs. Helmsley's former top aide, and
Joseph Licari, the couple's former financial manager, also were
expected to be indicted.
   The indictments followed a 15-month investigation into the
Helmsleys' finances by the New York Post.
   The Daily News said the four targets of the probe were directed
to surrender for arraignment at 8:15 a.m. Thursday. Their attorneys
in the past have denied any illegal activity by their clients.
   William Broadsky, Turco's lawyer, said his client ``is confident
that when all the facts are disclosed in court, he will be fully
exonerated.''
   The News said as many as 30 past and current employees of the
Helmsley organization were given immunity from prosecution in
return for testimony before state and federal grand juries.
