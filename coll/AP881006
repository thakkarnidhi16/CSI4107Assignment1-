   President Reagan said Thursday he believes
Republican Dan Quayle's performance in the vice presidential debate
``headed off, or should have headed off, all this picking on him
that has been going on.''
   ``I think he handled himself very well,'' Reagan told reporters
who questioned him at a state dinner for President Moussa Traore of
Mali.
   ``I really think that Quayle actually, just by the whole nature
of the event, headed off, or should have headed off, all this
picking on him that has been going on,'' the president said.
   Reagan also said that some of the points that the Democrats were
claiming were made by Bentsen in the debate were based on ``things
that were not factually true, such as who is responsible for the
deficit and so forth.''
   Reagan, who is making a campaign trip to Michigan on Friday,
said he will be picking up the pace of his involvement in the
campaign between now and Election Day.
   Asked whether he thought the issues were being addressed in the
campaign, he said, ``Yes, I do. At least by our side.''
   Earlier, posing for photographers before a private meeting with
Traore, Reagan was asked whether he thought Quayle would be damaged
by the exchange in which Democrat Lloyd Bentsen criticized him for
comparing himself with the late President John F. Kennedy.
   ``No,'' he said. ``I thought that remark was a cheap shot and
unbecoming a senator of the United States.''
   When asked if it was a mistake for Quayle to make the comparison
in the first place, Reagan said, ``No. The only comparison he was
making was that he was being attacked, I think unfairly, on the
basis of his age and his experience in government and he was
pointing out that John Kennedy, who sought the highest office and
won it, had actually less experience in government than he had and
was the same age.''

   President Corazon Aquino has banned
foreign trips by administration officials except in urgent cases
approved by her, according to a presidential order published today.
   Mrs. Aquino, who has visited eight countries, Hong Kong and the
Vatican since she came to power in 1986, said the limit to foreign
travel was necessary to conserve money and compel officials to
perform their chores at home.
   ``These officials should be on hand to efficiently and
effectively manage their respective offices and be available to
respond immediately and decisively to matters that require their
attention,'' she said.
   Manila newspapers said Mrs. Aquino issued the order because many
officials were traveling abroad too frequently.
   During the last two years, Mrs. Aquino has traveled to
Singapore, Indonesia, the United States, Japan, China, Hong Kong,
Switzerland, Italy, the Vatican and Brunei.

   Kidnappers holding two Americans
threatened the hostages' safety Thursday in venting their anger
over proposals to send U.N. troops to police Lebanon's stalled
presidential elections.
   A Christian militia leader on Thursday called for U.N. troops in
Beirut, a day after France suggested the idea.
   The kidnappers' warning came in a typewritten statement in
Arabic from the Revolutionary Justice Organization. The statement
was delivered to the Beirut independent newspaper An-Nahar along
with a Polaroid picture of U.S. hostage Joseph James Cicippio.
   ``We shall use all the cards to thwart these conspiracies,
including the card of the safety of the hostages, which we shall
make the backbone of our confrontation,'' the statement said.
   The photograph showed Cicippio, 58, of Valley Forge, Pa., in a
navy blue track suit with red stripes sitting on a blanket-covered
bed. His hands were clasped in his lap and he was smiling as he
faced the camera, but he looked considerably thinner than in
previous pictures released by his captors.
   Cicippio was acting comptroller at the American University of
Beirut when he was kidnapped on the school's campus on Sept. 12,
1986.
   Revolutionary Justice, believed linked to Iran, also claims to
hold Edward Austin Tracy, 57, of Burlington, Vt., an author, who
was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986 in Moslem west Beirut.
   The note came three days after another group, Islamic Jihad for
the Liberation of Palestine, freed Mithileshwar Singh after 20
months of captivity. Singh, an Indian professor, is a legal
resident of the United States.
   Singh was kidnapped in Beirut with three American colleagues,
who are still captives. A U.S. State Department team is debriefing
Singh in Wiesbaden, West Germany, and an official close to the team
said Singh was providing ``a lot of raw information'' that could be
helpful in learning about Americans still held in Lebanon.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Americans held with Singh are Jesse Turner, 41, a native of
Boise, Idaho; Alann Steen, 49, of Boston; and Robert Polhill, 54,
of New York City.
   Sixteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in
Lebanon and believed held hostage. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Thursday's statement from Cicippio's kidnappers denounced ``the
rude call for imperialist intervention under the slogan of
internationalization by a colonial power whose black history is
mothering our present tragedies.''
   This appeared to be a reference to France, which proposed this
week dispatching a U.N. peacekeeping force to Beirut to oversee
election of a new president in Lebanon, a former French colony.
   Two rival Moslem and Christian governments emerged in Lebanon
after Parliament failed to elect a new head of state to succeed
President Amin Gemayel when his six-year term expired Sept. 22.
   The communique accused right-wing Christian militants of
collaborating with Israel, Iraq and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization to partition Lebanon as a first step to turning it
into ``an Israeli satellite and a NATO base for intrigues against
the people of the region.''
   It called the Christian militants ``the grandsons of the
crusaders'' and warned: ``We shall mete out the just punishment to
the conspirators.''
   It was the first communique from Revolutionary Justice since
July 7, when the group threatened to ``punish'' hostages for the
U.S. downing of an Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf.
   Moslems, who make up 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million people,
have been fighting for an equal share of power in the nation's
13-year-old civil war.
   Christian militia commander Samir Geagea on Thursday echoed
France's call for U.N. peacekeepers in Beirut's Christian and
Moslem sectors to oversee presidential elections.
   ``I propose the formation of a U.N. force to deploy in the
greater Beirut to oversee the presidential election,'' Geagea said
in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Geagea said the plan should include withdrawal of his Lebanese
Forces militia from Christian east Beirut, and of Syrian troops and
allied leftist and Moslem militiamen from the city's western sector.
   Asked whether the proposed U.N. force should remain after
Parliament elects a new president, Geagea said: ``It is for the new
president and the new Cabinet he forms to decide that.''

<DATELINE>DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In December 1985, when 248
soldiers and eight crewmen died in a plane crash in Gander,
Newfoundland, the remains were dug out of the ice and snow and
transferred here to be identified and prepared for burial.
   Nearly 400 servicemen stationed at Dover Air Force Base
volunteered to work around the clock at the gruesome task, cleaning
the building, running errands, putting together uniforms _ all to
see that the bodies were returned to their families before
Christmas.
   The long hours in which the tragic became the mundane inevitably
led to a special kind of stress, and that in turn led to a special
kind of counseling at this base, which serves as the U.S.
military's morgue and mortuary.
   The counseling program for the volunteers is called ``critical
incident stress debriefing.''
   ``The debriefing process is basically designed to help normal
people ... deal with exposure to overwhelming and traumatic events
in terms of dealing with it personally, emotionally and
professionally,'' said Michael J. Robinson, director of the base
Family Support Center.
   ``What ended up happening,'' Robinson said, recalling the
aftermath of the Gander crash, ``was that early on, probably about
four days into the operation, people began to notice that people
were having a lot of trouble coping, dealing, functioning.
   ``And a lot of the behavior we saw people dealing with were
situations that you find in battle fatigue-like situations, combat
stress situations.''
   It wasn't the first time for Dover Air Force Base.
   Inside the main door of the mortuary is a simple wooden plaque,
headed ``Significant Events,'' listing numbers and faraway place
names that evoke memories of flag-draped coffins.
   The places _ Gander, Jonestown, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf _ are
reminders of the thousands of dead U.S. servicemen and the
civilians whose remains have come home through the base.
   A nondescript, 30,000-square-foot building houses the largest
mortuary operated by the armed services.
   ``It's really the largest mortuary in the country,'' said
Charles Carson, a civilian government employee who started in the
funeral business in 1950 and who has been in charge of the facility
for 17 years.
   The mortuary can handle up to 100 bodies per day, and there is
storage space for up to 1,000. The average workload is 55 to 60
bodies per month, but the average workload is not what the mortuary
is noted for.
   War, disasters and terrorist acts _ the ``significant events'' _
have sent 23,722 bodies through the mortuary, 21,693 of them during
the Vietnam war.
   The Jonestown, Guyana, catastrophe where followers of cult
leader Jim Jones committed suicide, resulted in 913 deaths in
November 1978.
   The base received the remains of the seven astronauts from the
space shuttle Challenger.
   When a major tragedy occurs, there is an outpouring of
volunteers from among the ranks of servicemen stationed at Dover,
as in the case of the Gander crash. ``The troops on this base, they
really rallied to this thing. They really wanted to help,'' Carson
said.
   Before the remains arrive, Carson briefs volunteers in an effort
to determine how they perceive death and whether they ``have
hang-ups about dead bodies.''
   Nearly 200 volunteers were on hand when the bodies of 237 U.S.
servicemen were returned from Beirut, Lebanon, victims of the
terrorist bombing of a Marine barracks in October 1983.
   As is most often the case, the bodies from Beirut were
identified and embalmed before arriving. At Dover, they were given
cosmetic work and dressed for burial.
   Gander was significant because the remains came directly from
the crash site, Robinson said.
   Volunteers, working 10 to 14 hours at a stretch, ``were exposed
to some things the average person has a great deal of trouble
dealing with.''
   ``There were some people who had real physical discomfort,
people who were nauseous. We had some people who were coping
extremely well, able to do the job and keep going,'' Robinson said.
   To help alleviate the stress, a mass debriefing was held and
psychological counseling was offered.
   Since the Gander disaster, the Defense Department and all
branches of the military have begun to explore the implications of
the exposure to and the handling of dead bodies.
   Robinson and four others at the base have taken training courses
designed mainly to help firefighters, police officers and emergency
medical personnel learn to cope with the intimacy with death that
they find in their jobs. Robinson hopes to have at least eight or
nine people trained at all times.
   During the Gander disaster, base personnel reacted intuitively
and from knowledge of post traumatic stress disorder, Robinson
said, adding that officials learned ways to ``shelter people from
some of the factors that would increase the likelihood of showing
longterm effects from post traumatic stress disorder.''
   During a stress debriefing, he said, small groups discuss what
they experienced _ ``what it was like for them, what was the
hardest part about that, because what we know is that if someone
talks about exposure to that type of event, the likelihood of them
ending up with longterm post traumatic stress disorder symptoms is
going to be markedly decreased.''
   According to Robinson, volunteers' time in the mortuary will be
reduced in the future. ``Once you go past the third and into the
fourth day, you can predict a lot of the things that are going to
be happening to people emotionally and physically in terms of
wearing down,'' he said.
   As groups are rotated in and out they will probably be debriefed
and given two days off before being allowed to return.
   ``We know what we need to know now,'' Robinson said.

<TEXT>
   The success of this summer's ``Bull Durham''
has helped lead the way to an outpouring of movies about baseball,
once considered box-office poison by the moguls who ran the
Hollywood studios.
   During its first month of release, ``Bull Durham,'' a funny,
sexy account of minor-league baseball starring Kevin Costner and
Susan Sarandon, scored $26 million in ticket sales in the United
States and Canada. The Orion release, written and directed by
former bush league player Ron Shelton, has been followed by ``Eight
Men Out'' and ``Stealing Home.''
   ``Eight Men Out,'' John Sayles' drama about baseball's greatest
scandal, the sellout by members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox,
received a warm welcome from critics. Stars include Charlie Sheen,
D.B. Sweeney, John Cusack and Christopher Lloyd.
   Jodie Foster won raves for her performance in ``Stealing Home,''
the story of a minor league ballplayer seeking a comeback after
years on the skids. TV's Mark Harmon co-stars.
   Upcoming baseball movies include:
   _ ``Major League,'' with Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger as
members of a hapless team who suddenly become winners, Rocky-style.
   _ ``The Scout,'' Anson Williams directing Rodney Dangerfield as
a baseball scout who uncovers a potential superstar. It is filming
this fall.
   _ ``Shoeless Joe,'' filming in Dubuque, Iowa, with Kevin
Costner, James Earl Jones, Amy Madigan and Burt Lancaster.
According to writer-director Phil Alden Robinson, it is not really
a baseball movie.
   Based on a novel by W.P. Kinsella, it concerns a farmer
(Costner) who is told by a spirit that Shoeless Joe Jackson of
Black Sox fame will come back to life if he builds a diamond in a
cornfield.
   _ ``Trading Hearts,'' already playing in a few regions, a
romance about a pitcher (Raul Julia), who is cut from spring
training.
   Producer Herb Jaffe said ``Trading Hearts'' also is not a
baseball picture.
   That's a hangover from the long-held belief that baseball
strikes out in theaters. The arguments most often heard over the
years are that baseball is incomprehensible to foreign audiences,
and that women, who make up a large part of movie audiences, will
not want to see films about baseball.
   Thom Mount, producer of ``Bull Durham'' and part owner of the
minor league Durham, N.C., Bulls, encountered such prejudice when
he sought a releasing company.
   ``Five studios turned us down before Orion picked up `Bull
Durham,''' he said. ``We were told simply that baseball pictures
don't make money.'' He attributed the film's success to the appeal
of Costner.
   ``Also, young women are impressed with the role Susan Sarandon
plays _ a strong, vital, liberated character.''
   By attracting the female audience, ``Bull Durham'' appears to
have solved one of Hollywood's prejudices. It remains to be seen
whether it can also appeal to foreign moviegoers; there is hope in
baseball-crazy Japan, and the game has been spreading to other
countries as well. Given the reasonable cost _ $9 million _ ``Bull
Durham'' is assured of a profit in the domestic market alone.
   A survey of baseball movies over the years indicates that the
studios' anti-baseball attitude may have been justified. Even the
box-office luster of Robert Redford couldn't convert the
allegorical ``The Natural'' into a winner.
   The best-remembered of baseball movies, ``The Pride of the
Yankees,'' with Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, was another commercial
disappointment.
   Many other biographical films have failed to excite the
movie-going public, especially women:
   ``The Winning Team,'' with Ronald Reagan as Grover Cleveland
Alexander; ``The Babe Ruth Story,'' William Bendix as the great
Bambino; ``The Stratton Story,'' James Stewart as Monty Stratton,
who staged a comeback after losing a leg; ``The Pride of St.
Louis,'' Dan Dailey Jr. as Dizzy Dean; ``The Jackie Robinson
Story,'' in which the black pioneer in the major leagues played
himself; ``Fear Strikes Out,'' Anthony Perkins as Jim Piersall,
victim of mental illness.
   Baseball musicals have proved to be only middling hits: ``Damn
Yankees'' with Tab Hunter and Gwen Verdon; ``Take Me Out to the
Ballgame,'' with Gene Kelly, Esther Williams and Frank Sinatra. The
same with comedies: ``Alibi Ike'' (Joe E. Brown); ``Rhubarb'' (Ray
Milland); ``It Happens Every Spring'' (Ray Milland).
   The difficulty of selling a baseball movie to the studios is
illustrated with ``Eight Men Out,'' produced, oddly enough, by
three women: Barbara Boyle, Midge Sanford and Sara Pillsbury. A
book about the White Sox scandal was optioned in 1980, but the film
was not made until this year.
   ``We couldn't get a development deal anywhere,'' Pillsbury said.
``The story had three strikes against it: The subject was
undeniably baseball; it was an ensemble piece; it was period and
hence expensive. We were told that baseball pictures had never been
successful, especially overseas.''
   The producers finally made a deal with Orion Pictures, which
also sponsored ``Bull Durham'' and ``The Scout.''
   Pillsbury thinks ``Eight Men Out'' will appeal to women.
   ``Baseball is simply the arena that the story takes place in,''
she said. ``It's more of a human story which is all the more
exciting because it is true.''
   ``The Scout'' also had a tortuous route to the screen. The film
actually went into production in 1982 with Peter Falk as star, then
was suspended. Earlier this year Orion sent it to Kathy
Lymberopoulos, producer and associate of Rodney Dangerfield.
   The story, she said, centers mainly on a baseball scout's life
and less on the game itself. As to any feminine prejudice against
baseball, she added, ``I love baseball, and so do a lot of women.
You look around a ballpark today and you'll see about
half-and-half, men and women.''
   What do the players themselves think of baseball movies? Here's
Lou Johnson, 53, star of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1960s and
now doing community service, lecturing against alcohol and drug
abuse:
   ``I've liked some of them, like the Lou Gehrig story, Roy
Campanella (TV movie) and Jackie Robinson, `Bingo Long' and `The
Natural.' But you're not going to get an accurate picture of
baseball out of movies. There's got to be a lot of fantasizing.
They give you what the public wants, not what is real.
   ``I especially liked `Bingo Long' because it was about the Negro
American League, and I could identify with it. It captured the
particular social life and lifestyle that we all went through,'' he
said.

   D.B. Sweeney approaches acting the way Shoeless
Joe Jackson played baseball: Just do it.
   ``The best theory I ever heard about acting was from (James)
Cagney,'' said Sweeney, 26, who plays Jackson in John Sayles'
``Eight Men Out,'' the story of the 1919 Chicago White Sox scandal.
   ``You walk in. Plant your feet. Stare the other fellow in the
eyes and tell the truth. All the acting theories I've heard, all
the books I've read ... you can't get it any simpler or purer than
that.''
   ``Eight Men Out'' tells the story of the biggest scandal in
baseball. The 1919 White Sox were widely regarded as the best team
of their time. With such pitchers as Ed Cicotte and Lefty Williams,
and a lineup featuring future Hall of Famers Eddie Collins and Ray
Schalk, Chicago won the American League pennant and were heavy
favorites against the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series.
   No one, however, could play ball like Jackson, a lifetime .356
hitter and outstanding left fielder. Once a mill worker in South
Carolina, he had little education and could not read or write, but
was peerless on the field.
   ``He was very passive,'' Sweeney noted. ``He took the path of
least resistance in everything he could. Everything he did was from
a defensive mode, except on the field, where he attacks.''
   Sweeney wanted to contrast Jackson's athletic grace with his
awkwardness in private life.
   ``On the field, I wanted him to be like (ballet superstar
Mikhail) Baryshnikov. I wanted every move he made to be
beautiful,'' Sweeney said. ``Off the field, I wanted him to be
tentative.''
   Players earned little money in Jackson's era and were often
tempted by gamblers to throw games. Eight members of the White Sox,
including Jackson, agreed to, or were aware of, an effort to
deliberately throw the series against Cincinnati.
   The Reds won the series and the White Sox' poor play aroused
widespread suspicion. The following year, Commissioner Kenesaw M.
Landis permanently banned Jackson and his seven teammates from
baseball.
   No one could ever prove that Jackson, who batted .375 in the
World Series, ever tried to throw a game. More likely, he was
punished for being aware of the fix and not trying to stop it.
   ``They don't kick you out of the Pentagon for knowing about
fraud,'' Sweeney said, adding that Jackson, who died in 1951,
should have his name cleared and be inducted into the Baseball Hall
of Fame.
   Daniel Bernard Sweeney was born and raised in Shoreham, N.Y. He
attended Tulane University and hoped to play major league baseball
until tearing ligaments in his right knee.
   The injury convinced Sweeney to pursue a career in acting, and
he transferred to the performing arts division of New York
University. After graduating in 1984, he appeared in the Broadway
revival of ``The Caine Mutiny.''
   He made his film debut in Sidney Lumet's ``Power,'' and has
since appeared in Francis Ford Coppola's ``Gardens of Stone'' and
``No Man's Land.''
   Although Sweeney has not appeared on stage in two years, he
still prefers the working atmosphere of the theater.
   ``On `No Man's Land,' there were about four producers, one
director to start the film and one to end it. We had five different
writers. And by the way, we also have these actors,'' he said.
   ``In a play, even if it's a Neil Simon play on Broadway, it's
going to have to be about the actors or nobody's going to come. I
enjoy acting on stage better because there are less people with
walkie-talkie's in your face.''
   Sweeney felt an immediate rapport with Sayles (``Brother From
Another Planet,'' ``Matewan''), and enjoyed working with him on the
set.
   ``We met in New York and talked for about an hour. We talked
about Roberto Clemente (the late Pittsburgh Pirates star). John
likes the Pirates. He's a real blue-collar man. Those are the right
reasons to like a baseball team,'' he said.
   ``I had access to John all the time. We had a great
relationship. We would just check in with each other to gauge each
other's continued enthusiasm.''
   To prepare for the film, Sweeney traveled to Kenosha, Wis., and
worked out with the local minor league team.
   ``Kenosha is a good town for Jackson. A real blue-collar town.
Everybody there works for one of those corporations. I think
there's a similar ethic about work that Jackson might have grown up
with.
   ``That's the world where Jackson came from.''
   Playing Jackson boiled down to forgetting about everything
except baseball.
   ``I tried to stand there and clear my mind,'' Sweeney said. ``He
would just stand and take his three swings and more often than not,
hit it, and hit it well. In my daily life, I have to deal with bank
statements, acting, associates and friends and things. It's often
like a juggling act.''

   It's so, Joe.
   The baseball movie, long relegated to Hollywood's minor leagues,
is the winner of 1988's cinematic comeback of the year award. From
summer smash ``Bull Durham'' to critical rave ``Eight Men Out,''
baseball movies are back.
   And so what if ``Stealing Home,'' the Mark Harmon-Jodie Foster
entry in the baseball movie race, was almost universally panned?
Two out of three means Hollywood is batting .667 this year.
   The bounce back of baseball has prompted musings on the subject
in The Washington Post, The New York Times and Newsweek. Actor
Kevin Costner delivered the Most Valuable Performance in ``Durham''
as veteran minor league catcher Crash Davis, but an assortment of
stars suited up this year: Mark Harmon, Charlie Sheen and D.B.
Sweeney, to name a few.
   Costner and Sheen will do it again for movies coming out next
year. The switch-hitting Costner will appear in ``Shoeless Joe,''
playing a farmer under the sway of ``Black Sox'' star Joe Jackson's
ghost, while Sheen will be joined by ``L.A. Law'' star Corbin
Bernsen in ``Major League.''
   But why this return of the ballplayer as movie star after years
without any horsehide hits?
   _ The `R' rating. Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig, who was married in
``Pride of the Yankees,'' never enjoyed the off-field activities of
Durham Bulls rookie righthander Nuke LaLoosh. And if Susan Sarandon
had played Mrs. Gehrig, Lou might have been the luckiest man on the
face of the Earth.
   _ The popularity of baseball. Virtually everybody has played or
watched the American Pastime. Major league attendance increases
every year _ in fact, you can expect that announcement from
outgoing commissioner Peter Ueberroth within weeks of the season's
finish this year.
   _ The ``I-Can-Do-That'' Syndrome. This factor is best described
by National Lampoon editor Matty Simmons: ``Any 5-foot-3, 270-pound
slob can watch George Bell blast a Roger Clemens 95-mph fastball
into northern Quebec and say to himself, `I can do that.' Why?
Because baseball players look like human beings. They look like
they belong behind a 7-Eleven counter.''
   Think about it. Can't you picture New York Mets phenom Gregg
Jefferies serving up a cold Slurpee and a Big Gulp? Now try to
imagine New York Giants rookie Jumbo Elliot, 6-foot-6, 305 pounds,
doing the same thing.
   As Simmons points out, Elliot could BE a 7-Eleven counter.
   There's one more big reason: the movies are better. In the past,
most baseball movies focused on one player, one star. There was
Jimmy Stewart as one-legged pitcher Monty Stratton. And Anthony
``Psycho'' Perkins as outfielder Jimmy Piersall. Or Ronald Reagan
playing hurler Grover Cleveland Alexander before his career really
took off.
   ``Bull Durham'' was the product of writer-director Ron Shelton,
who spent five years kicking around the minor leagues in the
Baltimore Orioles organization. ``Eight Men Out'' was done by John
Sayles, a die-hard baseball fan.

   Military authorities allowed a
Chinese research ship to sail away today after they were convinced
the vessel had simply sought shelter from a typhoon and was not
smuggling guns to local communist rebels, officials said.
   The 3,324-ton Science Research Vessel No. 1 had steamed into
northern Luzon Island's Casiguran Sound late Monday and Philippine
Constabulary troops seized it early the next day after a boarding
party found guns and ammunition aboard.
   The Chinese Embassy said the ship was seeking shelter from
Typhoon Nelson, which skirted northern Luzon Wednesday, and the
arms aboard were for protection of the ship's 56 scientists and 45
crew from pirates.
   The arms included three machine guns, eight assault rifles, two
semi-automatic rifles, two hand guns and 4,850 rounds of ammunition.
   Maj. Julius Yarcia, a constabulary intelligence officer
inspected the vessel for a second time Wednesday, and told
reporters today he found no signs the ship or the people aboard had
violated any Philippine law. The ship's scientists were reportedly
aboard to conduct underwater research.
   Military officials are wary of ships with arms because of
frequent reports of smuggling to communist rebels waging a 19-year
insurgency. Casiguran is in an area known for years as a rebel
stronghold.
   China maintains diplomatic relations with the Philippines and
has consistently denied giving the rebels any material aid.

   Bonifacio Santos, whose mother never
owned more than one pair of shoes at a time, may be one of the
country's foremost experts on footwear. His job: he shines Imelda
Marcos' shoes.
   Santos says it's a full-time job to polish and buff the 2,400
pairs of shoes that Imelda left behind when she and her husband,
Ferdinand Marcos, fled to Hawaii after the February 1986 uprising
that toppled his administration.
   For maintaining the thousands of dollars worth of shoes, about
half of which are on display at the Malacanang Palace museum,
Santos earns 2,300 pesos, or $115, per month.
   ``I know my salary is not enough to buy even one pair of
imported shoes like these,'' said Santos, 29.
   Soon after the Marcos administration collapsed, President
Corazon Aquino's government announced that the former first lady
had left behind 3,000 pairs of shoes, most of them imported.
   Eva Toledo, curator of the museum, said later inventories
reduced the figure to ``only'' 2,400 pairs, some of which were
found in Marcos residences throughout the Philippines.
   ``I was shocked when I first saw them,'' said Santos, one of 16
children. ``When my mother's shoes wore a hole in the bottom, she'd
get a new pair. That's the way it is with most of us Filipinos.''
   Santos said he spends every Friday brushing the dust from the
shoes. The rest of the week is devoted to polishing and buffing. By
the time he finishes polishing every pair, it's time to start all
over again.
   ``I clean the shoes with shoe polish,'' he said. ``I have to use
so many colors to match the shoes. We've had to wrap some of them
in plastic now, just to protect them.''
   The collection includes elegant high heels, slippers with giant
pompons and one pair with battery-operated, five-inch heels that
glow. Most are imported. Imelda's size, 8{, is hard to find in a
country where the average woman wears a size 6 shoe.
   Santos says proudly that his own brown shoes are strictly
``locally made.''
   Toledo said the government cannot get rid of the shoes until a
court decides who owns them. The shoes, along with millions of
dollars worth of property, businesses and other possessions, were
seized by the government when Marcos fled the country.
   ``We will have to continue taking care of them,'' she said.
   Toledo said the shoes must be continually polished to prevent
deterioration because of high humidity and poor storage facilities.
   About half the collection is stored in the basement of
Malacanang Palace, beneath Imelda's former bedroom. The palace is
on the banks of the Pasig River, and water is seeping up from the
basement floor.
   Toledo said that although the Marcos family spent a fortune
acquiring personal possessions, they appear to have made little
effort to provide for care and maintenance.
   ``Water oozes up through here and there's nothing we can do
about it,'' she said, tapping her feet on the tiled basement floor.
   Santos said that despite his shock at the Marcos' excesses, he's
proud of his job, which he considers a ``service to the Filipino
people.''
   ``And besides, without a job, I'd go hungry,'' he added.

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli army's use of
plastic bullets to break up Palestinian demonstrations is filling
hospital wards with casualties and prompting calls for tighter
controls.
   Victims of the new ammunition, including two teen-agers treated
for plastic bullet wounds at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City,
complain that stones thrown by protesters do not warrant the
penalty.
   ``It's unreasonable punishment,'' said Mazul Abu Lail, 19, a
tailor who was shot in the ankle.
   In a nearby bed, 16-year-old Rifaat Massoud, a construction
worker, nodded in agreement.
   ``It isn't right and it isn't fair for the soldiers to shoot
innocent people,'' Massoud said, shifting uncomfortably with a
bullet wound in his left side.
   The plastic bullet was introduced in August to supplement rubber
bullets, water cannons, tear gas and clubs in dealing with the
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the other weapons ``proved
to be insufficient to cope with stone throwing'' and that the army
needed something less lethal than lead bullets.
   The aim, Rabin said, is to reduce anti-Israeli violence in the
territories with a minimum of fatalities. Since the uprising began
Dec. 8, at least 280 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds
injured. Six Israelis have died.
   But Rabin has acknowledged that the introduction of the plastic
bullets may lead to more injuries.
   In the past three weeks, more than 325 Palestinians have been
wounded in clashes with Israeli troops, many by plastic bullets,
hospital officials and Arab sources say.
   The army says plastic bullets can penetrate the body, but they
are not supposed to be lethal if fired from at least 70 yards.
However, at least four deaths from plastic bullets have been
reported at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.
   Last week, Dr. Rustum Namari, director of the Mukassad Hospital
in East Jerusalem, showed reporters fragments of a plastic bullet
removed from the brain of a critically injured West Bank youth.
Namari said the bullet appeared to have been fired at close range.
   ``If a plastic bullet enters the throat, chest or abdomen, it
has the potential to cause death,'' said a surgeon at Shifa
Hospital who spoke on condition of anonymnity. ``Remember, too,
that bullets respect no age,'' he added. Victims, he said, have
ranged in age from 7 to 90.
   The bullets, developed after Israeli officials studied use of
plastic ammunition in France, are produced in Israel.
   Similar plastic rounds have been used in Northern Ireland for
riot control since 1970, and at least 13 deaths have been
attributed to them there.
   The United States, Britain and Egypt have objected to the use of
plastic ammunition against Palestinian demonstrators, and
opposition has been mounting in Israel.
   A senior official of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which
provides humanitarian services to Palestinian refugees, filed a
complaint with Israeli military officials after casualties in Gaza
jumped from 19 in July to more than 130 in September.
   Last week, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel filed a
petition with Israeli Attorney General Yosef Harish, urging him to
issue legal guidelines on the use of the new bullets.
   The group contended that ``opening fire for purposes of
deterrence is an illegal act'' and called on Harish to block use of
the bullet for riot control.
   Until recently, Israeli soldiers were instructed to fire lead or
plastic bullets only if their lives were in imminent danger. In
recent weeks, however, firing rules have been changed so troops may
use the plastic rounds to break up demonstrations.
   The army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, told a parliament
committee Tuesday that the army needed to stop riots before they
get out of hand.
   ``Arabs who deliberately choose to go out and demonstrate are
getting injured,'' Shomron was quoted as saying in Jerusalem
newspapers. ``Eventually they will realize that it is not in their
interest to get involved in riots.''
   But he insisted strict orders had been issued against misusing
the new weapon. In addition to a firing range of 70 yards, the
bullets are to be aimed only at legs, Shomron said.

   China has set a course toward reconciliation with
old adversaries, talking summitry with the Soviet Union and India
and making economic deals with South Korea.
   In what appear to be breakthroughs after years of talks, China
is sending Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Moscow and preparing for
a visit by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India. Both events could
occur before year's end.
   Qian, the first Chinese foreign minister to make a working visit
to the Soviet Union since Chou En-lai in 1956, is expected to lay
the groundwork for the first Chinese-Soviet summit since Nikita
Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1959.
   A summit would effectively normalize relations, which have been
difficult since Nikita Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung split in 1960
over ideological differences and leadership of the Communist world.
Relations reached bottom with border fighting in 1969.
   China's diplomatic impasse with India is just as old. Heads of
government met last when Chou, as premier, visited New Delhi in
1960, and the last Indian prime minister who traveled to Beijing
was Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954.
   The two most populous nations in the world have been at odds
because of India's pro-Soviet stance, close Chinese ties with
Pakistan and a border feud that led to fighting in 1962.
   Beijing also is forging new ties with another former enemy in
war, South Korea. Direct and indirect trade could double to the
equivalent of $3 billion this year and Shandong province, facing
South Korea across the Yellow Sea, recently agreed to an exchange
of trade offices with South Korea.
   South Korean auto and electronics makers plan to invest in
Chinese plants, and tourists from South Korea are being welcomed to
China. Formal diplomatic ties are unlikely soon, however, because
China remains close to North Korea, its economically moribund ally
in the Korean War of 1950-53.
   Qian, the foreign minister, said in a recent interview that
economic ties with South Korea were ``only natural'' as China
opened up its coastal areas.
   The mood of detente also extends to Japan, a frequent object of
Chinese criticism despite its role as a major trading partner and
chief source of financial aid.
   Japanese officials in Beijing note a marked reduction over the
past year in Chinese warnings about a resurgence in Japanese
militarism or Japan's tendency to forget crimes it committed in
World War II. Both nations called the visit by Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita of Japan in August the beginning of a ``new era''
in relations.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping has said since gaining power a
decade ago that China needs peace on its borders to achieve
economic development. China began border talks with India in 1981
and negotiations with Moscow in 1982.
   Little progress has been made in either forum. The possibility
of Gandhi and Mikhail S. Gorbachev standing on the Great Wall owes
more to the more relaxed state of the world.
   U.S.-Soviet disarmament agreements, moves to settle wars in
Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf, and prospects for peace in
Angola, Cambodia and other areas appear to have given China more
room to maneuver.
   ``Dialogue is taking the place of confrontation and the tendency
to seek peaceful settlement of international disputes is growing,''
Qian said in a recent address to the U.N. General Assembly.
   A Western diplomat said: ``The Chinese may see the world as less
dangerous to their interests. If you don't have to use a lot of
energy to protect yourself, it gives you more flexibility.''
   Younger leaders who have emerged in the past year are edging
away from a foreign policy based mainly on the restating of
formulas and principles.
   One of them, Premier Li Peng, noted recently that China and the
Soviet Union share a 4,300-mile border and declared: ``Strain on
relations between the two countries is not in the interest of China
because we need to modernize our country in a peaceful
environment.''

   Romance, clodhopper shoes for men and lullaby
tapes for yuppie babies will be hot in 1989, but it will be a
ho-hum year for fashions and a bad year for fat kids, according to
The American Forecaster 1989.
   Other '89 trends identified by the Forecaster: gutterless
bowling alleys, fighting dogs on steroids and turkey hunting.
   New Age religion channeling will become passe in 1989, along
with teddy bears and soft cookies, said Kim Long, author of the
sixth annual 192-page Forecaster, which went on sale this week.
   Long said 1989 could be a boring year trend-wise.
   The problem, he said, is that baby boomers _ the one-third of
the U.S. population born between the years 1946 and 1964 _ are
concentrating on their careers and families, and college students
have grown serious.
   The rise of romance and a growing de-emphasis on sex in
advertising, movies and television are directly linked to the aging
baby boomers, Long said.
   ``More of them are having their first kids, and that tends to
slow you down and keep you close to home,'' he said.
   Long was surprised by the growing popularity of lullaby tapes
for the babies of baby-boomer moms. ``Baby boomer mothers who don't
have time or don't know how to sing lullabies are buying tapes from
the professionals,'' he said.
   Clothing styles are becoming conservative and utilitarian, Long
said. ``There is nothing in men's or women's fashions that is a
jump ahead _ pretty boring,'' he said.
   In men's footwear, this means the return of big shoes _
expensive, leather wingtips and brogues. ``The big shoe thing has
been building slowly and is part of the gradual return to
traditional clothing,'' Long said.
   Long, a Denver free-lance writer, has been writing The American
Forecaster since 1983. His predictions have gained such
respectability that the Old Farmer's Almanac gave Long space in the
1988 and 1989 editions.
   Long said the New Age practice of channeling, popularized by
actress Shirley MacLain, will fade in 1989 because of skepticism
and ridicule.
   But astrology will remain hot in 1989, Long said, mainly because
of President and Nancy Reagan's reliance on astrological
interpretations and the subsequent efforts by astrologers to
legitimize the practice as a science.
   Out-of-shape youngsters will be put in fitness programs as the
preoccupation with health trickles down from adults to their
offspring, Long predicted.
   Some curiosities among the trends that will take hold in 1989:
steroid use to make fighting dogs meaner and stronger, gutterless
bowling alleys and a surge in turkey hunting, which Long said was
becoming popular because the birds are tough to shoot.
   Gutterless bowling alleys are for novices and the hopelessly
uncoordinated, Long said. Inflatable tubes are placed in the
gutters between the lanes.
   Long said in an interview last week that of his 1988 forecasts,
he is proudest of his prediction that girdle sales would increase
and of his identification of biodegradable plastics as an important
development.
   On the down side, he was off the mark in predicting the end of
the TV shows ``Dallas'' and ``Dynasty'' and in saying that Pee Wee
Herman would go prime time.
   Long wrote in the '89 Forecaster that Michael Dukakis will be
the next president, but last week he hedged. ``According to every
single indicator from the common to the bizarre, it's too close to
call.''

   In just six months, Italian fashion has
experienced a radical mood swing from aggressive and sexy to
subdued and demure.
   Leaving the miniskirted, spike-heeled woman behind, the Italian
designers presenting their spring-summer 1989 collections in Milan
this week are courting a younger, at least outwardly more innocent
woman who loves pants, long skirts and flat shoes.
   Her favorite colors are tender shades of cream and pink or the
classic combination of white with navy blue or black. Her taste in
fabrics ranges from diaphanous georgette and chiffon to batiste and
linen.
   Crisp white blouses, always a sign of good clean living, pop up
throughout the collections. Some are man-tailored, others daintily
lace-collared, still others a feminine version of the bowling shirt.
   Gianfranco Ferre, Italy's ``numero uno'' shirtmaker, opts for a
wide collared, man-tailored silk shirt embellished by a giant
nautical motif.
   The entire Ferre collection, presented in Milan Tuesday, was an
ode to the sea, with navy blue and white stripes the dominant
pattern and anchors, compasses and life preservers printed
everywhere.
   At the height of the miniskirt mania last year, Ferre, known for
his staid fashion, shocked the fashion crowd with the shortest,
tightest look on the Milan runway.
   In keeping with the current search for lost innocence, his
spring-summer collection brings hemlines right down to the ankle
and softens the silhouette with wide tops and loose-fitting pants.
   Extra feminine touches were offered by the high sailor suit
waistline on skirts and pants, and enticing see-through,
star-sequined T-shirts.
   Evening at Ferre was all stars and stripes in long shimmery
evening gowns, the tightest seen thus far on this week's Italian
ready-to-wear runway.
   On Wednesday, the fourth day of the five day showings, Basile
and Ferragamo continued the trend toward calmer, more feminine
styles.
   Luciano Soprani, for Basile, picked dainty floral prints for his
super-soft long skirts worn under a neat tight waisted blazer or a
belted Safari jacket.
   Evening wear turned the fashion page back to the heyday of the
debutante ball. Dressed in their empire-waisted full-skirted
strapless evening gowns, they looked as innocent as a busload of
college freshmenn at their first mixer.
   Even when the rest of Milan was vying for the shortest look,
Ferragamo persevered in its classic tailored style, with a discreet
knee-skimming hemline. It took the sedate Florentine tailors little
effort to lengthen this look to mid-calf in slim unfussy skirts
worn under a simple short-sleeved linen blazer.
   The classic look continued in the Chanel-inspired little black
day suits with gold buttons worn with a Ferragamo logo T-shirt.
Ferragamo, famous for its shoes, capitalized on its own classics by
dotting the collection with little golden shoes as lapel pins and
charms on a bracelet.

   Comedian Whoopi Goldberg wants to
end her two-year marriage to Dutch cinematographer David Claessen,
citing irreconcilable differences.
   Details of the divorce petition Miss Goldberg filed Tuesday
weren't disclosed by her spokeswoman, Lee Solters.
   Claessen, 29, and Miss Goldberg, 38, met during the filming of a
documentary on the homeless.
   The couple have no children. Solters said Wednesday that they
``have been separated for some time'' and that Miss Goldberg has
been living with cameraman Eddie Gold.
   Miss Goldberg, who won an Oscar nomination for her performance
in Steven Spielberg's ``The Color Purple,'' stars in Warner Bros.'s
forthcoming movie ``Clara's Heart.'' She will soon be seen on the

   The photographer whose car and camera were
damaged by Cher's boyfriend, 24-year-old Rob Camilletti, says
Camilletti is getting off the hook.
   ``I think he should have been charged with assault with a deadly
weapon. No, I'm not pleased with these charges,'' Peter Brandt, a
photographer for the entertainment tabloid Star, said Wednesday.
   Camilletti was charged Wednesday with reckless driving and
malicious mischief. The misdemeanor offenses are less serious than
the felony charge of assault with a deadly weapon for which
Camilletti was booked after the June 27 confrontation. Camilletti
was released on $2,000 bail.
   Camilletti had said he lost control of Cher's black Ferrari
while swerving to avoid photographers outside the home he shares
with the Oscar-winning actress. He said he hit Brandt's car and
then smashed his camera and telephone.
   Brandt accused Camilletti of trying to kill him, and sued the
couple for unspecified damages.
   Reckless driving carries up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000
fine; the two counts of malicious mischief could bring up to 18
months in jail and a $6,000 fine.

   Sheelah Ryan, winner of Florida's
record $55.1 million Lotto jackpot last month, passed up the chance
to claim another prize her extraordinary luck brought her: a
blender she won at a raffle.
   Her name was drawn for a door prize at an open house held for a
new office of Prudential Bowles Realty, where she used to work,
said owner Wil Bowles.
   By the time her name was drawn Friday, Ms. Ryan had left and
another name was selected for the prize.
   ``I don't think missing it will worry her,'' said Bowles.
   Her former boss also disclosed that Ms. Ryan has bought a
$260,000 house through the real estate firm she quit after winning
the nation's largest lottery prize.
   Bowles said Ms. Ryan paid cash for the house, the location of
which he would not disclose.

   Gov. William Donald Schaefer disputes Playboy
magazine's depiction of him as an oddball, saying the publication
should stick to pictures of nude women.
   ``I'm not weird,'' Schaefer declared Tuesday in response to an
article in the November issue.
   Schaefer, whom the magazine identifies as the ``chuckly bachelor
gov of the Orioles' home state,'' was lumped in the same category
as comedian Pee-wee Herman, singer Michael Jackson and sexologist
Dr. Ruth Westheimer.
   ``I think they ought to stick to publishing pictures of nude
women and not bother people who are trying to do something,'' said
Schaefer, who hadn't read the story.
   The article recycles asome old Schaefer adventures, including
the day he was delivered in a box to Annapolis to become governor.
   It also recounts Schaefer's habit of calling male reporters
``girls'' and his insistence on staying in his longtime Baltimore
rowhouse. Playboy likens him to Norman Bates, the crazed motel
owner in the Alfred Hitchcock thriller ``Psycho'' and a sequel,
``Psycho II.''

   President Reagan has been named to receive
the 1988 Humanitarian Award from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and
his wife, Nancy, will receive the center's first Museum of
Tolerance award, the center said.
   Nearly 2,000 guests, including Barbara Walters, Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Ben Kingsley, are on the invitation list for the
Oct. 30 awards presentation.
   The ceremony will take place during a gala to celebrate the 80th
birthday of Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter who lives in Austria, said
center spokeswoman Lydia C. Triantopoulos.
   The Los Angeles-based center selected Reagan as its 1988
recipient in recognition of his efforts to prevent nuclear war, his
staunch support of Israel and his efforts on behalf of Soviet
refuseniks, said a statement released Wednesday.
   Previous recipients of the Humanitarian Award included French
President Francois Mitterrrand and former Soviet refusenik Natan
Sharansky.
   The center studies the Holocaust and serves as an
information-collection center in the hunt for escaped Nazis.

   The owners of the National Football
League teams approved the sale of the New England Patriots to
shaver-maker Victor Kiam and the sale of the Seattle Seahawks to a
group headed by California land developer Ken Behring.
   The transactions were approved unanimously Wednesday pending the
reception of documents by the league office within 10 days.
   Controlling interest in the Patriots was sold by the William H.
Sullivan Jr. family, which founded the team, to Kiam for a reported
$90 million after a 14-hour negotiating session this week.
   ``I'm gratified,'' said Kiam, chief executive officer of
Connecticut-based Remington Products Co.
   The Seahawks sale already had been completed and league approval
was only a formality. The 13-year-old franchise was sold by the
Nordstrom family of Seattle department store fame to a group headed
by Behring for a reported $80 million.

   Foreign investors with a ``significant
interest'' in American business or property would have to disclose
their holdings to the government under legislation approved by the
House.
   ``Give us the opportunity to have a basic inventory of ownership
of the American economy,'' Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, the sponsor,
said as the House approved the measure 250-170 on Wednesday.
   The measure now goes to the Senate, where its chances for
approval are dim.
   Those owning more than 5 percent of a business or property
valued at more than $5 million or that has more than $10 million in
annual gross sales would have to report their identity and holdings
to the Commerce Department.
   The measure also would apply to investors holding more than 5
percent of a combination of two or more businesses or properties
valued at more than $20 million or with annual gross sales of more
than $40 million.
   Foreigners with ``controlling interests'' in U.S. businesses and
properties would be required to submit more extensive reports,
including balance sheets and the identities of officers and
directors.
   The Commerce Department would establish a registry of foreign
interests owning American property.
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., described the measure as
``election-year xenophobia'' designed to capitalize on fear of
foreigners among voters.
   Supporters retorted that foreign takeover of U.S. assets should
not occur in secret.
   ``The American people have the right to know who holds the
mortgage on America,'' Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, declared.
   The bill originally was included in the House's version of a
wide-ranging trade measure signed by President Reagan Aug. 23. But
sponsors, seeking to build support for the trade bill, dropped the
foreign ownership provision before it went to Reagan.
   The foreign ownership disclosure bill is now moving forward as
separate legislation.
   The measure's prospects are dim in the Senate, where it would be
vulnerable to a time-consuming filibuster with only days remaining
until lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time.
   Critics say the bill would bare business secrets that ought to
be private, thus scaring off foreigners whose investment helps to
finance the budget deficit and fuels the economy, creating jobs for
Americans.
   ``The issue is confidentiality,'' said Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y.
``This bill doesn't have adequate safeguards.''
   Data on foreign ownership of American property already is
collected by 17 federal agencies. But the information is often kept
secret, even from Congress, and in any case the names of the actual
owners rarely appear.
   Complaints persist that even those reports are often incomplete,
inaccurate and largely meaningless and that hundreds of billions of
dollars in new investment have simply fallen through the cracks in
recent years.
   Opponents also blasted the bill as discriminatory toward foreign
investors because Americans would not have to provide the same
information.

<HEAD>Study Says Consumers Likely To Feel Effects Of Wheat Price Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Agriculture Department analysis of this
summer's drought-induced rise in wheat prices says consumers might
feel some effect at grocery stores at least through 1989.
   ``Past movements suggest that the drought's influence on farm
prices of wheat will be felt for about a year at the industrial
(wholesale) level and for a year and a half or more by consumers,''
the report said.
   The study was done by Ronald A. Babula of the department's
Economic Research Service, and David A. Bessler, Texas A&M
University, and reported in the current issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine.
   Babula said Wednesday in a telephone interview that he and
Bessler are not forcasting how food prices will behave in the
coming months. Prices of various items could decline but still
leave some impact from the 1988 drought.
   ``We're not predicting anything,'' Babula said. ``We're showing
how things have moved in the past ... and some of the things that
we might expect to see happen in the future.''
   A statistical computer model was used to show how prices of
wheat at the farm, wholesale prices and retail prices have moved
together in the past.
   The model was then ``shocked'' with an increase in the farm
price of wheat to simulate the 7.7 percent average monthly boost
during May, June and July, when the effects of the drought were
first reflected in the market.
   ``When the farm price shock occurs, processor (wholesale) prices
for wheat rise immediately, peaking a month after the rise in the
farm price,'' the report said. ``At their highest, processor prices
increase less than half of the 7.7 percent increase in the farm
price. Processor price increases are felt for about a year, but the
impulse generally declines in strength through time.''
   On the other hand, the 7.7 percent average increase in the farm
price of wheat ``generates gradual, not immediate, increases in
consumer prices of wheat-related goods,'' the report said.
   Delivery, sale and consumption of flour, bread, cake mixes,
pasta and other wheat-related foods occur throughout the year and
are not as closely tied to the wheat crop cycle as processing,
which includes the flour milling and baking industries.
   ``So, the consumer price effects last more than a year,'' the
report said. ``Consumer price rises peak at seven months, but
prices stay relatively high until 17 to 20 months after the
initiating farm price shock. The increase in consumer prices is
smaller but more enduring than the jump in processor prices.''

   Some promising new biological weapons are
being used in the war against marauding grasshoppers, says the
Agriculture Department.
   In one development, two commercial firms _ Evans BioControl Inc.
of Broomfield, Colo., and Bozeman Bio Tech of Bozeman, Mont. _ have
adapted USDA technology for producing and storing a parasite,
Nosema lucustae. Department studies show the parasite kills 50
percent to 60 percent of grasshoppers in three to four weeks.
   The basic tests and development were done by the department's
Agricultural Research Service at the agency's Rangeland Insect
Laboratory in Bozeman by J.E. Henry and colleagues.
   Henry said the parasite is available to homeowners and ranchers
through regional agents and on contract to government agencies,
which use it on a large scale in the West. Grasshoppers cause an
estimated $400 million in damage to grass and crops each year, he
said.
   Spores of the parasite are put on wheat bran flakes to form a
bait. After the insects eat the bait, the organism ``attacks the
pest's fat cells and depletes its energy stores,'' Henry said in a
report issued here on Wednesday.
   The parasite remains in the grasshopper population because sick
females pass it on to offspring, and survivors eat dead relatives,
he said.
   Meanwhile, another development involves an agreement with Evans
Biotechnical to field test another natural killer, grasshopper
entomopoxvirus, the agency said. In laboratory tests, the virus
kills 20 percent to 30 percent of the grasshoppers right away and
stunts the growth of an additional 20 percent to 30 percent.
   Doug A. Streett, an entomoligist at the agency's Bozeman
laboratory, said Evans BioControl plans to produce the virus and
mix it with the parasite for tests on 1,000 acres in the West.
   Streett said that in combination the two ingredients may work
more rapidly to kill the grasshoppers.

from a year earlier.
   That didn't count 39.4 million gallons of ice milk, a 20 percent
increase from August 1987, or 5.21 million gallons of sherbet, up
13 percent.
   August production figures issued on Wednesday also showed butter
output at 74.2 million pounds, up 12 percent from a year earlier.
Production of American-type cheese, at 214 million pounds, was up 4

<HEAD>Report: EPA Rarely Enforces Laws on Drinking Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal and state governments took legally
required enforcement action for only 2.6 percent of more than
100,000 violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act in fiscal 1987, a
conservation group said today.
   It is the policy of the Environmental Protection Agency to
permit 23 months to lapse before even considering enforcement
actions such as fines, lawsuits or administrative orders, the
National Wildlife Federation said in releasing its findings.
   The federation said the nation's water systems or states
notified customers of only 6 percent of the violations instead of
every single one as the law requires.
   The federation said it examined 15,000 pages of EPA records
covering the 1987 fiscal year and found that 36,763 public water
systems committed 101,588 violations of the act. The affected water
systems serve about 40 million people.
   Peter Cook, deputy director of EPA's Office of Drinking Water,
said he was at a loss to explain how the federation arrived at its
figures. He said his office recorded about 2,800 systems with
``significant'' violations in 1987, and 15,500 systems with
violations EPA believed minor, a decline from 4,500 and 17,000,
respectively, the year before.
   ``All regulatory agencies must have enforcement discretion,''
Cook said. When EPA finds a violation, ``It is our position that it
need not be an enforcement action'' that follows.
   Sixty-four percent of water systems serve fewer than 500 people,
with 73 percent of significant violators and 83 percent of minor
violators that small or smaller, Cook said.
   Small systems may have difficulty raising money for the best
equipment, he said. ``It may take some time for this community to
float a loan. ... You're talking about years. It doesn't make a lot
of sense, if you have a cooperative community which is moving
ahead, to beat them over the head with penalties that they can't
afford anyway.''
   Communities may be fined up to $25,000 for each day of
violation, though fines that large are rare.
   ``It's important to understand that if enforcement actions are
not taken, the states are aggressive in protecting the public
health'' through ``boil water'' notices to the public, requirements
for provision of bottled water and similar measures, Cook said.
   He said the agency ``heartily recommends'' to the states fines
and other actions against systems it considers ``recalcitrant.''
   There are about 201,000 water systems serving the public, of
which 59,000 are ``community'' systems serving more than 25 people
and the rest ``non-community'' systems serving resorts, campgrounds
and other areas used only part of the year or by a transient
population.
   The federation's report did not distinguish between excessive
concentrations of a contaminant and failure to monitor or failure
to report findings.
   But Norman Dean, a federation lawyer and principal author of the
report, said the records showed 13,224 violations of enforceable
contamination standards by community water systems and 4,282
violations by ``non-community'' systems.
   ``This is not a situation where 99 percent of the violations are
paper work violations,'' Dean said.
   Monitoring and reporting requirements are ``the heart of the
law,'' the study said. ``They enable the identification and
correction of public health risks before they blossom into crises.
   ``One EPA official told us that some public water systems stop
monitoring when they become aware of a known health standard
violation,'' the report said.
   The only detailed EPA examination of a state program, a review
of Florida's efforts completed in 1984, found a ``significant
deficiency'' in reporting by state authorities of all violations to
EPA.
   State agencies took only 2,544 enforcement actions, the
federation said. EPA during the year completed only 50
administrative orders, had proposed 57 more and had issued 101
notices of violation, the first step before issuing an order or
going to court.
   EPA told the federation recently it actually had completed 183
or 184 such orders during the 1987 fiscal year, but the federation
said it was unable to verify the number or explain the discrepancy
with the lower numbers found in its own examination of the records.
   Requirements that customers are to be notified are aimed at
forcing water systems to toe the mark so they will not have to face
public criticism, but water systems issued only 5,269 such notices
and states only 598 in the year studied, the report said.
   The law permits states to run drinking water pollution
prevention and enforcement programs as long as they are as strict
as a federal program would be. A state may opt out, leaving EPA
with direct authority. Only Indiana, Wyoming and the District of
Columbia have chosen to let EPA enforce the federal law in their
jurisdictions.
   But in all states, the law was changed in 1986 to require EPA to
act directly against local water systems if state authorities do
not act within 30 days of learning of a violation.

   Gen. Augusto Pinochet is one of the few
authoritarian leaders left in Latin America, where elected civilian
government has returned to most countries.
   The nearest geographically is Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, who has
ruled Paraguay since seizing power in 1954.
   President Fidel Castro has governed Cuba since leading a
successful revolution in 1959 and installing a communist regime.
   In Panama, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega qualifies as an
authoritarian leader but is not technically the chief of state.
   Elected civilian governments have replaced military regimes in
the last few years in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador and
Bolivia.
   Military governments ruled Brazil for two decades until 1985.
Five generals took turns as president, chosen by their peers and
sharing power with them.
   Argentina's armed forces ousted civilian President Isabel Peron
in March 1976 and retained power until 1983, leaving in disgrace
after defeat in the Falkland Islands war with Britain.
   Governing was an act of the military institution in both
countries, but the regimes of Pinochet, 72, and Stroessner, 75, are
personal.
   Pinochet declared a few years ago: ``Not a single leaf moves in
this country unless I move it,'' and Stroessner probably could say
the same.

<TEXT>
   Augusto Pinochet has been tireless in
what he sees as a mission from God to reconstruct a new,
communist-proof society.
   Shrewd and combative, Pinochet successfully resisted the
regional trend toward elected civilian rule that prevailed in many
Latin American countries in the 1980s. His right-wing authoritarian
regime, he says, is a bulwark against Marxism.
   Pinochet took power in 1973 in a coup that toppled the elected
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende. The takeover won
wide support because it occurred at a time of social unrest and
economic chaos. Few, however, could have predicted Pinochet would
remain in power this long.
   But Pinochet immediately banned all political activity and
purged the nation of tens of thousands of leftists. Most were
expelled, although hundreds were imprisoned and scores were
tortured and executed, according to human rights groups.
   Pinochet also outmaneuvered the commanders of the navy, air
force and national police, who were initially supposed to alternate
with him as the country's ruler. Using his muscle as army
commander, the most powerful of Chile's military branches, he
emerged as the sole leader.
   Born Nov. 25, 1915, in the port city of Valparaiso, Pinochet was
one of three children of a customs official. Ignoring parental
pleas to study medicne, he entered the military academy, after
twice being rejected as too young and physically weak.
   In the army he filled out to 185 pounds and earned a university
degree. Now, he boasts a boxer's physique and is said to lifts
weight daily. He is reported to drink little.
   According to a 1980 autobiography, he noted an international
Marxist threat while commanding a camp for Communist prisoners in
1948 and lectured on the dangers of communism while teaching at the
national war college.
   However, when Allende became president Pinochet remained
outwardly loyal and was named army commander a month before the
coup. Some participants in the takeover said he joined the
conspiracy opportunistically at the last minute.
   The political repression that followed the coup earned Pinochet
an image as a brutish dictator. Repression included the
assasination of critics in exile, including Orlando Letelier,
killed in a Washington car bombing in 1976. Pinochet has denounced
foreign criticism as interferring in Chile's internal affairs.
   He announced plans to reshape Chilean society and construct
safeguards against communism. A Constitution approved in a 1980
referendum bans all ideologies based on class struggle. It also
included a phased return to democracy and called for the
presidential plebiscite that occurred Wednesday.
   He launched a free-market economic program that, coupled with
heavy foreign borrowing and an overvalued currency, produced a
financial near-collapse in the early 1980s. Massive anti-government
protests threatened to topple his government. But he moderated his
policies, winning even the begrudged praise of his opponents with
five years of steady economic growth and stability.
   Pinochet preaches patriotism, family values and hard work. His
stern demeanor appeals to many common Chileans, but his behavior
bothers most educated citizens.
   He often appears in public with his wife, Lucia. They have three
daughters and two sons.
   In recent years, especially since a September 1986 assasination
attempt by leftist guerrillas, Pinochet has come to cite God. In
1987 he declared, ``God put me on the top.''
   Now obsessed with personal security, his motorcade routinely
includes four cars of heavily armed bodyguards, a van carry an army
commando unit, an ambulance and an army helicopter gunship.

<HEAD>It Was a Pretty Good Summer for Airlines, Their Passengers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's airlines did a pretty good job of
delivering their passengers on time this past summer, with more
than four of every five flights arriving near schedule, government
figures show.
   The Transportation Department said Wednesday that in August the
13 leading airlines had an on-time record of 83 percent, the second
best since monthly reports have been available. The only better
month was June, which had an 84.3 percent on-time record, the
government said.
   From April through August the airlines reported better than 80
percent of their flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule _
considered on time by the government _ each month.
   The summer months normally have delay problems because of the
heavy vacation travel as well as frequent thundershowers and other
weather problems, according to industry experts.
   Two years ago the summer travel months brought record flight
delays and loud complaints. The Federal Aviation Administration
reported more than 1,000 delays a day because of air traffic
control problems alone in the summer of 1986. That was an increase
of 25 percent over the previous years. No statistics on total
number of delays were available at that time.
   The delay problem eased a bit in the summer of 1987, but
congressional pressure and loud protests from air travelers
prompted the department to order the airlines to provide monthly
on-time performance reports beginning in September 1987.
   During the first year of the reporting requirement, the air
carriers averaged a 78 percent on-time record, the department said
Wednesday.
   Air traveler complaints to the department's consumer affairs
office have declined sharply, according to the figures provided
Wednesday.
   During September, the last month available, the department
received 1,897 such complaints, 20 percent fewer than in August and
66 percent fewer than in September 1987, when the department
received 5,618 complaints from air travelers.
   The on-time statistics cover the 13 leading airlines and do not
include delays attributed to mechanical problems, although they do
include delays caused by poor weather.
   In August, according to the department, Delta Air Lines had the
best on-time record among the largest air carriers, with 86.9
percent of its flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule,
followed by Continental Airlines (86.8) and American Airlines
(85.9).
   The overall best on-time record was given to two smaller Sun
Belt carriers _ America West (91.5 percent) and Southwest Airlines
(90.5 percent).
   Pan American World Airways and USAir reported the worst on-time
records, with one of every four flights arriving late, the
department said.
   The Salt Lake City, Utah, airport had the best arrival record in
August, with 91.4 percent of the flights landing within 15 minutes
of schedule. The Pittsburgh airport, where repairs on a runway have
contributed to delays, had the worst record, with 71.3 percent of
the flights landing on time.
   Hawaiian Airlines had the worst complaint record with 12.57
complaints for every 100,000 passengers flown in September,
followed by Pan American World Airways with 11.45.
   Meanwhile, in August the number of mishandled bags was down
slightly, averaging 7.03 for every 1,000 passengers, compared with
7.15 in July.
   TWA had the highest number of mishandled baggage reports, with
10.77 for every 1,000 passengers, followed by Piedmont Airlines at
8.93 per 1,000 passengers.

<TEXT>
   Congress is putting the finishing touches on a
campaign to reduce indoor exposure to radon, the naturally
occurring gas that health officials say is second only to smoking
as a cause of lung cancer deaths.
   Pending in the Senate is House-passed legislation that would
require inspections of public schools for dangerous levels of radon
and set a long-term national goal of having indoor air as free of
the gas as the air outdoors.
   Rep. James Florio, D-N.J., said he expects the bill to easily
clear the Senate in the closing days of the 1988 session and go to
the White House, where it already has been endorsed by the Reagan
administration.
   The broadly supported legislation, which won voice-vote approval
in the House on Wednesday, is moving toward the statute books in
the wake of a recent warning by the U.S. Public Health Service and
the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The agencies advised people to have their residences tested for
radon, an odorless, colorless gas produced by the decay of uranium
deposits found in the ground in many parts of the nation.
   EPA and USPHS estimated that nationally one of every 10 houses
could have dangerous levels of radon. They said they believe such
levels are present in about 25 percent of the homes in 17 states
where radon deposits are prevalent.
   Authorities have estimated that indoor concentrations of radon
are responsible for as many as 20,000 lung cancer deaths annually.
   The House-passed bill would require EPA to conduct a national
survey of school buildings and advise local education agencies
about ways of reducing high concentrations of radon.
   It would authorize $30 million over the next three years for a
matching grant program to help states set up their own radon
control programs. Less than half the states now have such programs.
   EPA would be required to set up training programs to teach state
and local officials proper techniques for radon monitoring,
assessment and mitigation. It also would have to set standards for
certifying radon measuring devices and rating the effectiveness of
radon-control contractors.
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, the bill's floor manager in the
House, said these provisions are needed to protect homeowners from
unscrupulous contractors and profiteers.
   ``New radon testing and mitigation companies spring up
overnight, and unfortunately not all of them are qualified or
scrupulous,'' he said.
   ``Contractors have charged as much as $4,000 when they could
have charged $1,000 and still profited nicely,'' Luken said. ``Even
worse, salespeople have tried to palm off fly paper and vacuum
cleaners as testing and mitigation devices.''
   The bill also would create a process under which state and local
building codes would eventually be revised to require the use of
construction techniques that would minimize the entry of radon into
structures.
   EPA has set 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as the level
at which homeowners should take steps to make their houses more
resistant to radon seepage from the ground.
   House sponsors of the bill say it is uncertain whether this
level is fully protective of human health during long-term exposure
to indoor radon. They said this is why they want to set a national
goal of minimizing exposure to radon.

   President Reagan issued a challenge to
anti-Semitism at home and abroad as he dedicated a Holocaust museum
in the face of protesters who called the memorial un-American and
anti-Christian.
   In a speech at a cornerstone ceremony near the Washington
Monument, Reagan on Wednesday said the Holocaust Memorial Museum,
scheduled for completion on the site in 1992, ``will examine the
nature and meaning of the continuing curse that is anti-Semitism.''
   ``I think all of us here are aware of those, even among our own
countrymen, who have dedicated themselves to the disgusting task of
minimizing or even denying the truth of the Holocaust,'' he said.
``This act of intellectual genocide must not go unchallenged.''
   Reagan referred to groups that dispute the generally accepted
account of the murder of about 6 million Jews and other persecuted
people in Nazi death camps during World War II.
   ``And yet, just as we must challenge it here at home, so too we
must challenge anti-Semitism abroad,'' the president said, accusing
the United Nations of ``intellectual infamy'' and the Soviet Union
of ``the subtler forms of anti-Semitism.''
   ``We know that the United Nations, whose peackeepers were
honored only last week for their service to the world, has yet to
repeal its infamous resolution equating Zionism and racism,'' he
told his audience. ``We know where such intellectual infamy can
lead. The world has learned that when the truth is turned on its
head, holocausts become possible.
   ``And there are subtler forms of anti-Semitism,'' Reagan added.
``There are still tens of thousands _ maybe even hundreds of
thousands _ of Soviet Jews who wait to leave the Soviet Union so
that they may live free as Jews. And here, as we lay this
cornerstone and vow that the Jewish people will never stand alone
against tyranny, I want to ask the Soviet leaders a question: Where
are those exit visas?''
   This and other remarks of the president were greeted with warm
applause by the invited audience of about 1,500. The president,
assisted by Harvey M. Meyerhoff of Baltimore, chairman of the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Commission, pulled a gold cord to reveal the
chunk of pink North Carolina granite that will stand at the corner
of the museum.
   As the president's motorcade approached the site, however, it
passed a scattering of pickets carrying signs. One read, ``Stop
Un-American Holocaust Museum on Our Historic Mall.''
   Another attacked the museum as ``Anti-American, Anti-Christian,
Anti-Truth.''

<HEAD>Reagan Hopes To Send Arms to Contras Despite Warnings From
Congress</HEAD>

   White House officials insist they are
continuing to look into prospects for renewing military aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras, despite warnings from Capitol Hill that the
administration doesn't have the votes needed to free $16.5 million
in stockpiled weapons for the rebels.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Wednesday
that ``it's all under consideration, and we haven't made a formal
decision.''
   A senior administration official, who spoke on condition he not
be identified, supported Fitzwater's comments, saying the
administration wanted to make clear ``we are not abandoning the
Contras.''
   The official acknowledged that hopes were dim for getting the
stockpiled weapons to the rebels this congressional term.
   But he also indicated that Reagan aides were looking toward the
possibility of renewing military aid under the next administration,
particularly if Vice President George Bush is elected.
   If the White House were to seek release of the weapons, it would
have to move quickly. Lawmakers, eager to return home to campaign
this election year, are expected to wrap up work on Capitol Hill
next week.
   ``There is some feeling now that a request couldn't be passed.
... We've had congressional leaders tell us the votes aren't
there,'' the official said.
   But he added that the issue, for the administration, is ``a
question of timing. Right now we're running out of time, and it may
be better to wait until the next administration.''
   Fitzwater noted that a provision in a defense appropriations
bill Reagan signed last weekend permits the president to request a
congressional vote on whether to release the $16.5 million weapons
stockpile, now stored in Honduras, to the rebels.
   Congress rejected an administration military aid request last
Feb. 3, and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the Contras
occurred on Feb. 29.
   Delivery of the equipment was halted because of the Central
American peace process and the cease-fire between the Contras and
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   The spokesman also pointed out that under the legislation,
Reagan must meet certain criteria in order to request the
congressional vote.
   Besides certifying that Nicaragua has sparked a crisis in
Central America, the administration must consult with the four
Central American democracies.
   Fitzwater said the president's justification for the release of
the aid also must meet two out of three conditions cited in the
legislation.
   Of the three, he said, the administration believes two had been
met: continuing unacceptable levels of Soviet aid and Sandinista
violations of the peace accords.
   The spokesman called the third condition _ that the Sandinistas
have initiated an ``all-out attack'' against the Contras _ ``an
open question.''

<HEAD>Research Reveals Widespread Pollution in European Waters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acid rain has polluted more than half
of Europe's lakes and rivers, and the contamination has spread much
farther than earlier believed, an international report said.
   The report, which was released Wednesday, said nearly all small
bodies of water in central Europe are so badly contaminated that
they can no longer be used for drinking water. It also said the
actual damage could be much worse because the research was based
mainly on information provided by the countries involved.
   ``In some cases, it is too late to do anything,'' said Kaarle
Kenttamies, head of the Finnish Environment Ministry team which
conducted the survey for the U.N.-sponsored Convention on
Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.
   ``In other countries, particularly the peripheral regions such
as Scandinavia and southernmost Europe, there is still hope,'' he
told The Associated Press.
   ``But many small lakes and rivers, especially in central Europe,
are dead, and only a 100 percent drop in sulfur emissions can save
them,'' he said. He also said dumping heavy doses of lime could
also help reduce acidity.
   The year-long research project showed nearly all smaller bodies
of water in central Europe can no longer be used as sources of
drinking water, Kenttamies said.
   Acid rain carries a high concentration of acids produced by
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other chemicals emitted during
the burning of fossil fuels. The U.N.-sponsored conference, which
drew participants from the United States, the Soviet Union and nine
west European nations, urged the Economic Commission for Europe to
adopt stricter measures to fight pollution caused by nitrogen and
sulfur emissions.
   The commission's member countries have decided to start a joint
international pollution monitoring project in 1989 to study
environmental changes caused by acid rain.
   ``Despite certain opposition to such research, particularly in
the United States and Great Britain, we can can safely say that
acidification is one of the worst pollution problems of the
1980s,'' Kenttamies said.
   President Reagan has been criticized by environmentalists for
failing to do more to solve the problem of acid rain during his two
terms in office. In August, however, he gave the go-ahead for
continuing negotiations toward U.S. participation in an
international treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acid
rain.
   
   Kenttamies rejected as ``nonsense'' the argument that no
conclusive evidence exists that fossil fuel-fired power stations
contribute heavily to acid rain.
   ``Whatever people say, I've seen enough reports and been to
enough conventions like the one here today to know that we have
such conclusive evidence,'' he said.
   The high cost of fighting acid rain is a problem for countries
which rely heavily on fossil fuels. Britain and Poland, both heavy
coal users, are the only European nations which refused to join in
a project to reduce sulfur emissions by 30 percent of 1980 levels
by 1993.
   Acid rain in Scandinavia, mostly from industrial centers in
eastern and western Europe, also has contaminated lakes and forests.
   Finns were recently shocked to learn of heavy pollution in what
had been considered virgin Lapland in northern Finland caused by
huge Soviet copper and nickel works in the Kola Peninsula.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee sent 11 of
President Reagan's court nominees to the full Senate, leaving 14
others with virtually no chance of winning confirmation this year.
   The committee on Wednesday approved two U.S. appellate court
nominees: U.S. District Judge John M. Duhe Jr. of Lafayette, La.,
for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; and state common pleas
Judge Richard L. Nygaard of North East, Pa., for the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   U.S district court nominees approved by the committee were:
Lewis Babcock, Boulder, Colo., for the District of Colorado;
Norwood C. Tilley, Greensboro, N.C., for the Middle District of
North Carolina; Alex R. Munson, Saipan, for the Northern Mariana
Islands; Robert Leon Jordan, Johnson City, Tenn., for the Eastern
District of Tennessee.
   Also, D. Brooks Smith, Altoona, Pa., for the Western District of
Pennsylvania; Charles R. Butler Jr., Mobile, Ala., for the Southern
District of Alabama; Jay C. Waldman, Philadelphia, for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania; Paul V. Gadola, Grand Blanc, Mich., for
the Eastern District of Michigan and James R. McGregor of
Pittsburgh, for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
   McGregor was approved on the request of Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa. A state judge who has issued controversial rulings, McGregor
could be held up on the Senate floor, according to committee
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del. Biden said he's not fully
satisfied with McGregor's qualifications but withheld final
judgment.
   Nominations that previously reached the floor: Richard L.
Voorhees, Gastonia, N.C., for U.S. district judge for the Western
District of North Carolina; Susan Liebeler, Falls Church, Va., for
U.S. circuit judge for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C.;
Robert P. Patterson Jr., New York City, for U.S. district judge for
the Southern District of New York; Stuart A. Summit, New York City,
for the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals.
   The following nominations are virtually certain to expire with
congressional adjournment:
   Appellate nominees Judith Richards Hope, Washington, D.C., for
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia; Pamela Ann Rymer,
Los Angeles, for 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Jacques L.
Wiener Jr., Shreveport, La., for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals; Guy G. Hurlbutt, Boise, Idaho, for the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals; Ferdinand F. Fernandez, Upland, Calif., for the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   District court nominees Vaughn R. Walker, San Francisco, for the
Northern District of California; Howard E. Levitt, Malverne, N.Y.,

<HEAD>Senate Probe Finds Price Increases But No `Price Gouging'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Price gouging at the nation's supermarkets, a
concern raised by lawmakers as drought crept over U.S. croplands,
has not materialized despite some unexplained cost increases,
congressional investigators say.
   ``The bottom line is that there has been restraint,'' Patrick J.
Leahy, D-Vt., said Wednesday at a Senate Agriculture Committee
hearing on food prices in the wake of the summer drought.
   At the hearing, the General Accounting Office unveiled a report
showing retail pasta prices rose 10.4 percent, cereal 7.1 percent
and white bread 8.2 percent from January through June.
   Forty-three percent of the pasta and cereal increases, as well
as 57 percent of the rise for white bread, came before June, when
the drought emerged as a serious problem for U.S. agriculture,
according to the report.
   But pasta, cereal and white bread prices rose more between June
and August than they did in the same period last year, the report
said.
   Some of the worst damage from blazing sun and scarcity of rain
came in the northern Plains, where durum wheat used in the making
of pasta is produced.
   Farm prices for durum as well as hard red spring wheat, a
primary ingredient in white bread, increased this year in
comparison with 1987, but that alone would not be enough to explain
the price rise.
   Livestock feed also came into short supply as a result of
searing heat, prompting producers to step up cattle sales and
driving down prices. Consumers, however, enjoyed no cost savings,
GAO officials told the panel.
   They said there was no clear explanation of just why prices of
wheat-based products exceeded levels explainable by the drought
alone.
   ``Prices of packing of food products went up significantly this
year,'' Mary Kenney of the GAO told the committee. She suggested
that might furnish at least part of the explanation.
   ``There could have been some labor cost increases. ... We don't
know if there were,'' said John W. Harman, associate director of
the GAO's resources, community and economic development division.
   The one group that should not be blamed for food price increases
is the farmers, said Steven D. Maurer, director of the Ohio
Department of Agriculture.
   ``The farmer's share of the good market dollar has remained
relatively constant,'' he said.
   The price of farm commodities on average accounted for 30
percent of the price of food at the supermarket last year. The rest
went to transportation, packaging, advertising and other marketing
costs.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., also said farmers should not be
blamed. In addition, he rejected the notion that price increases
before June could not have been related to the drought.
   He said he had expected ``a hot, dry summer'' and the food
industry might have done the same in view of its ``excellent
sources of intelligence.''
   ``Conclusive evidence of price gouging has not been found,''
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told the panel, ``but there are
indications out there'' that it could develop next year.
   ``My advice to consumers is to engage in comparative shopping,''
he said.

<HEAD>White House: No `Elderly' Index Needed To Figure Social Security
COLAs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration sees no need to
change the formula for calculating cost-of-living increases for
Social Security and other entitlements despite claims that millions
of beneficiaries are being shortchanged.
   White House Budget Director James C. Miller III on Wednesday
said it ``would make no difference'' in what the government spends
on those increases if one Labor Department consumer price index
were subsituted for another in figuring the increases.
   But in a written statement to the Senate Special Committee on
Aging, Miller said, ``I do not believe any changes are needed at
the present time.''
   The panel's chairman, Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., has introduced
two bills that would immediately substitute one inflation survey
for the other in calculating benefit increases and spend $1.5
million to develop a new survey devoted only to price changes
experienced by the elderly.
   With figures due out in two weeks on how big an increase 38
million Social Security recipients can expect in their checks next
year, the committee held hearings on Melcher's proposals Wednesday.
   Miller cited a Congressional Budget Office study showing that
families headed by people 65 or over have experienced ``the largest
real income gains of any age group between 1970 and 1986.''
   ``Social Security beneficiaries have in fact been well protected
from inflation over the last decade and a half under the exisiting
cost-of-living provisions,'' he said. ``Poverty rates among the
elderly have been cut in half over this period.''
   Since 1978, the government has used annualized third-quarter
changes in the Labor Department's consumer price index for urban
wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) to calculate the annual
benefit increases.
   Last year, for example, annualized inflation as measured by that
index for that quarter was 4.2 percent, yielding Social Security
recipients an average $21 a month increase in their benefit checks.
   Melcher and advocacy groups for the elderly want the government
to switch to a more widely used price index for urban households
(CPI-U) immediately, while developing an entirely new CPI-E for the
elderly for eventual use in calculating the benefit changes.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Melcher said the CPI-W understates the
increases that the elderly actually are experiencing because it
does not take into account the higher percentages of their income
spent on medical care and housing.
   Annual differences in the CPI-U and CPI-W indexes have ranged
from 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent over the past five years. But
cumulated inflation as measured by the wage earners survey totaled
16.5 percent over the five years compared with 18.2 percent as
measured by the more widely accepted urban household survey.
   ``This means that millions of retirees who depend on benefits or
pensions from these programs may not be getting a square deal,''
Melcher said. ``If all the costs of the elderly were figured in,
(annual) COLAs would be higher as much as $5 a month. For some
people $5 isn't very much money, but for many elderly $5 is a lot
of money.''
   At Melcher's instigation, the Labor Department earlier this year
constructed an experimental index measuring only the inflation
experienced by consumers age 62 and over.
   Reflecting that the elderly spend nearly 9 percent of their
income on medical costs compared with roughly 5 percent spent by
urban households in general, it showed inflation over the past five
years totaling 19.5 percent for those 62 and over.
   Had the experimental index been in use, the average Social
Security retiree would have received a total of $528 in additional
benefits over the past five years, said Mary Jane Yarrington, a
policy analyst for an advocacy group, the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
   However, Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood said the
experimental survey had larger sampling errors than the official
measures.

   The chairman of a Senate narcotics panel says
foreign banks must be forced to keep records of large cash
transactions to help block laundering of U.S. drug profits.
   ``Cash, U.S. dollars, are the stock and trade of narcotics
traffickers and currently there is a gigantic loophole,'' Sen. John
F. Kerry, D-Mass., said Wednesday.
   Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
narcotics and terrorism, said an estimated $30 billion to $100
billion in drug-tied U.S. cash is laundered each year.
   He and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the panel's ranking Republican,
said that when the Senate begins debate on sweeping drug
legislation they would push an amendment designed to create a paper
trail for prosecutors. Debate on the drug legislation is expected
to start before the end of next week, when Congress adjourns for
campaigning.
   Major drug traffickers now take U.S. drug profits by plane or
boat to nations in the Caribbean or Central America and deposit
huge chunks of cash in banks there, often under phony corporation
names, Kerry said. The dealers then have the banks wire the money
to the institutions' U.S. branches.
   In that way, drug traffickers can launder their illegal profits
and avoid federal regulations that require banks in the United
States to maintain strict records of cash transactions of $10,000
or more.
   The Kerry-McConnell proposal would extend that requirement to
foreign banks with U.S. branches as well as to American banks with
overseas offices.
   Kerry said he expected strong opposition from large banks.
   ``This bill will destabilize drug dealers' criminal networks by
denying them free access to the American banking system,''
McConnell said. ``It will give law enforcement officials the tools
necessary to trace and seize drug assets and prosecute those
criminals right out of business.''
   The Kerry-McConnell amendment would require the Treasury
Department to negotiate within two years agreements with nations
that have been identified as key money-laundering centers.
   Under the legislation, all offshore banks with U.S. ties would
be required to maintain records of cash transactions of $10,000 or
more, obtain from those depositors a waiver of privacy rights if
the records are needed in a drug-related investigation, and obtain
from depositors personal identification and documents stating the
source of the money.
   ``With enactment of this amendment, international drug dealers
will have to find a black market dry cleaner for their U.S. dollars
because all the legitimate laundromats will be closed to them,''
Kerry told a news conference.

<HEAD>Proposal To Combat `Greenhouse Effect' Focuses On Energy
Efficiency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new House bill designed to combat the
``greenhouse effect,'' or global warming trend, would require a
wide range of energy-saving measures, including a higher ``gas
guzzler'' tax and rebates for buyers of fuel-efficient autos.
   Republican and Democratic lawmakers said Wednesday in
introducing the legislation that they did not expect action on the
bill before Congress adjourns next week.
   The Reagan administration has said more study is needed before
taking action to curb the greenhouse effect.
   Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., chief architect of the new
proposal, said available options for reducing greenhouse gases such
as carbon dioxide can vary in cost by ten-fold or more.
   ``This makes it imperative that the strategy the federal
government undertakes in formulating global warming prevention
policies avoids imposing needless and wasteful expenditures ...,''
she said.
   The global warming trend, which some scientists say already has
begun, could raise the average temperature of the earth by 3
degrees to 8 degrees in the middle of the next century.
   The warming comes about because gases arising from human
activity build up in the atmosphere, trapping radiant heat that
normally would escape to space. The most important gas, carbon
dioxide, comes from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and
coal.
   Also on Wednesday, a report from the Environmental and Energy
Study Institute, a companion organization to the congressional
Environmental and Energy Study Conference, called for a `first
priority'' on energy efficiency by the next administration.
   The report said political leaders must be willing to raise the
consumer cost of using fuels that produce carbon dioxide. A
prominent example would be gasoline.
   Ms. Schneider's measure calls for substantial increases in funds
for research and development, modification of federal buildings to
create 40 percent energy savings by the end of the century, tough
efficiency standards for electric lights and major increases in
auto fuel efficiency along with a higher ``gas-guzzler'' tax and
rebates for buyers of efficient models.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree To Include Air-Defense Aircraft In Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say Moscow has made a key
concession in talks defining the agenda for a new round of
East-West negotiations to cut non-nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Two State Department officials, speaking on condition they not
be identified, said Wednesday the Soviets had given up their demand
that air-defense aircraft be excluded from the negotiations,
expected to start by next year.
   The negotiations would be between the 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the seven-member Warsaw Pact _ the first
such bloc-to-bloc arms talks.
   In another gesture, an official told The Associated Press, the
Soviets indicated they were prepared ``to do more on human
rights,'' possibly releasing additional political prisoners.
   About 300 have been set free in the 3{ years since Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, now the Soviet president, rose to power. The United
States is insisting on more movement before convening the East-West
negotiations on troop and armament reductions.
   President Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz have
expressed optimism that the arms control talks, which would cover
the vast expanse of Europe from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains
of the Soviet Union, will open by the end of the year.
   Narrower East-West negotiations dealing with Central Europe have
made little headway over the past 14 years. They would be replaced
by the new, broader talks.
   The Soviets made their demand for a ``special exemption'' for
air-defense aircraft in August, the official said. ``But now they
have thought better of it'' and ``sent signals'' the demand would
be withdrawn, the official said.
   The change in Soviet attitude was registered in talks Soviet and
Western leaders are holding in New York while attending the special
session of the U.N. General Assembly.
   It does not mean that NATO will be able to persuade the Soviets
to limit their aircraft, the official said, ``but we want to be
free to raise the issue during negotiations.''
   Naval forces, chemical weapons and nuclear arms will be excluded.
   A problem that has not been resolved is whether all of Turkey
and the Soviet Caucasus region should be included.
   The Western allies are trying to prevent cuts in Turkish forces
near Iraq and Iran, while the Soviets say they would have to be
compensated by excluding forces in the Caucasus.
   The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Soviets' stance on human rights remains the main issue to be
resolved before East-West talks could begin.

<HEAD>Teen-Age Computer Hackers May Have Run Up $650,000 In Phone Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten teen-age hackers may have run up $650,000
in telephone calls by tricking phone company computers, and their
parents could be liable for the tab, authorities said.
   ``They reached out all right,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Russell
Mayer said of the nine 14-year-old and one 17-year-old hackers.
``They reached out and touched the world.''
   Tom Spurlock, resident agent-in-charge of the Las Vegas Secret
Service office, said the teen-agers engaged in ``blue boxing,'' a
technique that enabled them to talk to fellow hackers throughout
Europe.
   ``It's very popular, very accessible. It's definitely going on
other places as well,'' Spurlock said Wednesday.
   ``They were calling numbers that were in the AT&T system, and
their (computer) programs would allow them to `jump' AT&T's
circuits, allowing them to call anywhere in the world.''
   The expensive shenanigans came to light when local phone company
officials discovered unusual activity on nine Las Vegas phone
lines, Spurlock said. He said federal agents obtained warrants and
searched the nine homes.
   The teen-agers were not taken into custody or charged, but their
computers were seized.
   ``They were pretty shook up when we visited them,'' Spurlock
said.
   Spurlock said the parents, who could be held liable for the
expensive phone conversations, were unaware of what was happening.
   ``One of the parents told us, `I thought he was being a good boy
because he was always working with his computer and talking to his
friends on the phone,''' Spurlock said.
   He said the number of calls and the destinations were still
being tabulated, but the $650,000 in calls was ``a good estimate.''
   Spurlock said the teen-agers had been using the system 13 months
and that each had amassed monthly bills of $5,000.
   Spurlock said it will be up to AT&T to decide whether to seek
reimbursement once a final tally is obtained.
   Mayer said the case probably would be left to local authorities
to decide whether to prosecute.

<HEAD>Experiment Boosts Prospects For Contraceptive Vaccine For Both

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine that makes the body attack sperm was
100 percent effective in tests with female and male guinea pigs,
the first demonstration of contraception without fail from a
vaccine, scientists reported today.
   The study, which also found the effects of the vaccination
temporary, raises the prospect that a similar vaccine might work in
women and men.
   But ``there are many things about it that would have to be
changed or improved to make it a useful method for either
agricultural animals or humans,'' said researcher Paul Primakoff.
   The vaccine is designed to prevent fertilization, which may make
it more widely acceptable than another vaccine already in human
testing that stops development of the embryo, other scientists said.
   Primakoff and colleagues at the University of Connecticut Health
Center in Farmington, Conn., reported the experiment in the British
journal Nature.
   None of the 25 female guinea pigs that were vaccinated before
mating had litters, nor did the mates of the six immunized male
guinea pigs. Animals that received sham immunizations for
comparison purposes remained fertile.
   Eleven of 24 females tested had regained fertility by nine to 11
months after the immunization, and all four of the longest-studied
group had delivered litters by 15 months. Among males, four of six
had regained fertility by seven months after the immunization.
   In a telephone interview, Primakoff said his team has since
produced contraception in 17 other male guinea pigs.
   The vaccine is designed to make the body's disease-fighting
immune system attack a protein found in guinea pig sperm. The
details of just how that blocks fertility in guinea pigs are not
known, Primakoff said.
   But immune system proteins called antibodies, taken from the
immunized females, prevented sperm from binding normally to guinea
pig eggs in the test tube. That suggests the vaccine blocks
fertilization within vaccinated females, Primakoff said.
   In males, the vaccination triggered an invasion of the testicle
by immune system cells. That is ``not something you would want
going on in your body'' because of the potential for long-term
harm, Primakoff said.
   So to produce a human male vaccine, researchers would have to
find a way to trigger just the antibodies without the rest of an
immune system reaction, he said.
   No evidence indicates the guinea pig vaccine would work in
humans, nor is there any assurance that human sperm contains a
suitable protein target for a similar vaccine, he said.
   Richard Bronson, director of the reproductive endocrinology
division at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, called
the research ``very encouraging.''
   It suggests research into a sperm-targeting vaccine is ``heading
in the right direction,'' he said.
   The 100 percent contraception rate makes the results ``really
terrific,'' said Nancy Alexander, director of applied fundamental
research for the Contraceptive Research and Development Program at
the Jones Institute of Reproductive Medicine in Norfolk, Va.
   A vaccine that prevents fertilization might avoid religious and
cultural implications of another kind of vaccine that has already
begun preliminary human testing, she said.
   That vaccine blocks the action of a hormone called human
chorionic gonadotropin. Scientists are unsure whether the blocking
prevents the blastocyst, a clump of cells that grows from a
fertilized egg, from implanting itself in the uterus wall, or
whether it prevents further development soon after implantion.
   Implantation normally takes place six or seven days after the
egg is fertilized.
   Researchers overseas have shown the hormone-blocking vaccine is
safe in humans and are preparing to start testing its
effectiveness, Alexander said.

   Security at the Athens airport
was virtually non-existent when a TWA airliner was boarded by
terrorists in 1985 and hijacked to Beirut, a passenger testified
during the trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   Australian William Henderson, 56, told the court Wednesday that
he was traveling with his family and was amazed at the lax security
just prior to the the Athens-to-Rome flight.
   ``There was no security there at all. I walked out to look at
the tarmac and came back in. No one stopped me,'' said Henderson.
   Henderson said electronic security devices did not detect a
knife he carried. ``I had a small pocket knife in my pocket, which
I always carry. It did not set any security check off.''
   ``I wondered why it didn't because it always had before,'' at
other airports, the retired school principal said.
   The court has been trying to determine how weapons, including a
chrome-plated pistol and hand grenades, were smuggled onto the June
14, 1985, flight. Hamadi has refused to say how the weapons were
taken on board.
   Greek officials repeatedly have asserted that security measures
at the airport were adequate before the hijacking ordeal, during
which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was shot to death.
   Henderson's wife, Rosemarie, 52, told the court Wednesday that
Stethem had talked with her daughter after the hijackers had beaten
him.
   Mrs. Henderson said that before he was shot, Stethem told her
daughter, Ruth, that he hoped the hijackers would pick him and not
his five married Navy colleagues on board if they were going to
kill someone. Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md., was single.
   ``He said to her that if anyone would have to be killed, he
hoped it would be him, because the others (five fellow divers) were
all married,'' Mrs. Henderson said, her voice breaking with emotion.
   Mrs. Henderson said her 19-year-old daughter would not be able
to testify before the three judges and five jurors until November.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger had hoped to end the trial by
the end of year but said Wednesday it would likely extend into next
year because of problems scheduling some witness' testimony. The
trial was recessed Wednesday until Oct. 11.
   The court did not ask Mrs. Henderson where the family lived in
Australia, or which school her daughter attended, in keeping with
its policy on protecting witness security.
   Waving her hands occasionally, Mrs. Henderson also told of how
Hamadi and TWA flight attendant Uli Derickson led Stethem down the
airplane's aisle after he had been beaten.
   ``The young man (Stethem) was crying. He was unable to walk by
himself,'' said Mrs. Henderson.
   Stethem was shot and killed by one of the hijackers when the
plane landed in Beirut a second time after returning there from
Algiers.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has confessed to being one of
the two gunman who hijacked the airplane but has denied firing the
shot that killed Stethem.
   Hamadi is being tried in a heavily guarded courtroom inside
Frankfurt's Preungesheim prison. Several dozen police armed with
machine guns and other weapons patrol the area during court
sessions.
   In addition to killing Stethem, the hijackers held 39 Americans
captive for 17 days.
   When Hamadi and Stethem arrived at their seats, Mrs. Henderson
said the defendant ``pointed the gun at my husband and said `out'
and they placed him in another seat. They placed the young man next
to me.''
   ``He was in shock. He also had a bandage around his neck. It had
blood on it,'' Mrs. Henderson said.
   Mrs. Henderson said that she later switched seats with her
daughter and that her daughter talked to the injured sailor at
length.

<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen shrugged off his differences
with Michael Dukakis over supporting Nicaragua's Contra rebels and
said the important point was they both support efforts to bring
peace to Central America while the Reagan administration offers
only a military answer.
   Republican Dan Quayle, meeting Democrat Bentsen in a debate in
Omaha, Neb., between the two vice presidential candidates, said
Dukakis' policy toward Central America was out of step with
mainstream United States voters.
   Asked about his long-term support for the Nicaraguan Contras
despite Dukakis' opposition to the aid, Bentsen said, ``Governor
Dukakis and I have disagreed on the Contra program _ no question
about that.''
   But, he said, he opposed the Reagan administration's Central
American policy because ``they look at the Contra aid program as
the only way to resolve that problem.''
   ``I really think we have to give peace a chance,'' Bentsen said,
``and that's why I have been a strong supporter of the Arias plan,
a plan that won the Nobel prize for President (Oscar) Arias, the
President of Costa Rica.''
   He said the United States had to work with leaders of Central
American countries to ``try to bring about the democratization of
Nicaragua by negotiation, by pressure, by counseling, by diplomatic
pressure _ that we ought to be trying that first.''
   The Reagan administration has paid too little attention to the
rest of Central America, Bentsen said.
   Said Quayle: ``There's no doubt, in a Dukakis administration
that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in
Nicaragua and that is unfortunate.''
   He said Dukakis seemed to think it was all right for the Soviet
Union ``to put in billions of dollars to prop up the communist
Sandinistas, but somehow it's wrong for the United States to give a
few dollars to the democratic resistance.''
   Quayle said he still supported the Monroe Doctrine, set forth in
1823 by President James Monroe, that the United States would oppose
any attempt by European powers to interfere in the Western
Hemisphere.
   And he said 85 percent Americans supported the 1983 U.S.
invasion of Grenada, but that Dukakis had criticized it.
   ``We turned a communist country into a non-communist country,''
Quayle said. ``The governor of Massachusetts is simply out of step
with mainstream America.''
   Bentsen noted that both he and Dukakis speak Spanish and said
they wanted to launch a new alliance for progress for Central
America and Mexico, ``a country with 85 million people sharing a
2,000-mile border with us, with half of those people under the age
of 15, a country that has had its standard of living cut 50 percent
in the last six years.''
   ``We ought to be concerned about that and we ought to be
involved,'' he said. ``Bring in the Europeans _ the Spanish, who
have a real affinity for that area. Bring in the Japanese, who have
a great capital surplus now and looking for places to invest it.''
   Such investment could foster peace, raise the standard of living
and provide the stability needed for democracy to prosper, Bentsen
said.

<HEAD>More Than 2,200 Soldiers Commit Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly said today that
2,670 soldiers committed suicide, were beaten to death or died from
other unnatural causes since 1980.
   The figures were provided to the assembly in a Defense Ministry
report on deaths in the 650,000 member armed forces.
   The report said 2,254 soldiers committed suicide with the
remaining 416 killed in assaults by their superiors or fellow
soldiers or other unspecified causes. The deaths were in all
branches of the armed forces, and included officers and enlisted
personnel.
   Discipline is notoriously harsh within the South Korean armed
forces. Younger soldiers can be subjected to beatings and other
punishments by older personnel despite an official ban on physical
abuse.
   The report also listed 3,723 other soldiers and officers killed
in accidents since 1980, such as explosions, mishandling of arms,
and motor vehicle and miltitry aircraft accidents.
   Korean males are subject to about two years of military
conscription.
   Dissidents have claimed some opposition supporters serving in
the military killed themselves because they could not stand
surveillance or discriminatory treatment in barracks.
   Some dissident leaders said they would form a special group to
investigate the deaths to determine if there had been any improper
conduct, according to Seoul newspaper reports.
   The Defense Ministry had to submit the report to the National
Assembly as part of legislative scrutiny on conditions within the
military.
   Under the new democratic constitution adopted last year, the
legislature is empowered for the first time in 16 years to inspect
the military and other branches of government.

<TEXT>
   Question: Let us assume ... the president is incapacitated ...
and you have to take the reins of power. ... What would be the
first steps that you'd take and why?
   Quayle: First I'd say a prayer for myself and for the country
that I'm about to lead. And then I would assemble his people and
talk. ... And I think this question keeps going back to
qualifications ... You've got to look at experience, and you've got
to look at accomplishments. ...
   Question: Would you acknowledge to the hundreds of injured and
maimed people ... deregulation may have gone too far and the
government should reassert itself in protecting workers' rights?
   Quayle: There is a commitment, and there will always be a
commitment, to the safety of our working men and women. ... In my
judgement, deregulation has worked. We have a deregulated economy
and we have produced through low taxes, not high taxes, through
deregulation, the spirit of entrepreneurship ...
   Bentsen: This administration came in and put in a James Watt and
Anne Gorsuch. Now that's the Bonnie and Clyde, really, of
environmental protection. And that's why it's important that you
have people that truly believe, and trying to represent the working
men and women of America.
   Question: Do you believe it's time to ... target federal money
to the small- and medium-size farmer?
   Bentsen: I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for
the American farmer. ... We've seen an administration that has lost
much of our market abroad because they have not had a trade policy.
... We would be pushing very hard to open up those markets, and
stand up for the American farmer.
   Quayle: The governor of Massachusetts ... went to the farmers in
the Midwest, and told them ... to grow Belgium endive. That's what
he and his Harvard buddies think of the American farmer.
   Question: Two guys come through your door ... and say, ``We'd
like you to change,'' without offering a lot of specifics.'' Why
would you accept their deal?
   Bentsen: ... If you let me write $200 billion worth of hot
checks every year, I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too.
... We need an administration that will turn this trade policy
around and open up those markets, stand tough with our trading
partners to help keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad.
   Quayle: ... We are proud of the record of accomplishment and the
opportunities and the hope for millions of Americans ... because of
the policies that we have had for the last eight years and we want
to build on that and change it for even the better.
   Q: Why not use the military to go after the South American drug
cartels and after General Noriega?
   Quayle: We are using our military assets in a prudent way to
deal with interdiction. ... But we've got to get on the demand side
of the ledger. We've got to get to education. ... We need to focus
on ... law enforcement. And here's where we have a major
disagreement with the governor of Massachusetts. ... You cannot be
tough on drugs and weak on crime.
   Bentsen: We'd put one person in charge in the war against drugs,
and we'd commit the resources to get that job done.
   Question: You said you'd say a prayer (if you took over in an
emergency) and you said something about a meeting. What would you
do next?
   Quayle: ... I know what it takes to lead this country forward.
And if that situation arises, yes, I will be prepared, and I'll be
prepared to lead this country if that happens.
   Bentsen: ... You have to look at maturity of judgment, and you
have to look at breadth of experience. You have to see what kind of
leadership roles that person has played in his life before that
crisis struck him. ...
   Question: Surely you must have some plan in mind about what you
would do if it fell to you to become president? ...
   Quayle: I will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of
the presidency of the United States of America. ... I have far more
experience than many others that sought the office of vice
president of this country. I have as much experience in the
Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency. ...
   Bentsen: Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack
Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack
Kennedy. ... And frankly, I think you're so far apart in the
objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the
comparison was well taken.
   Q: Does the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket have any realistic plan for
getting the American hostages being held in the Middle East
released in any due time?
   Bentsen: ... The one thing we ought to have, know by now is that
you can't go out and make secret deals with the Ayatollah. You
can't trade arms for hostages. ...
   Quayle: There's no doubt about it that arms for hostages is
wrong, and it will never be repeated. We learn by our mistakes. But
there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this
administration. ...
   Question: How do you explain ... how you can be a social
conservative ... and still run with Michael Dukakis on the national
ticket?
   Bentsen: Michael Dukakis wasn't looking for clone. I think it's
part of the strength and the character of this man that he reaches
out and that he wants someone that will speak up, and that I'll do.
   Question: Could you describe ... what experience you may have
had and how it shaped your political philosophy?
   Quayle: ... It's the advice that my maternal grandmother Martha
Pulliam, who's 97 years old ... she says ``You can do anything you
want to if you just set your mind to it an go to work.'' Now the
Dukakis supporters sneer at that, because it's common sense. ...
   Bentsen: ... To have spent part of my life seeing some of the
struggles that have taken place in one of the lowest per capita
incomes in the United States, and that's one of the reasons I've
worked so hard to try to assist on education. ...
   Closing Remarks:
   Quayle: ... The road of George Bush is the road to the future
and it comes down to this: an America second to none, with visions
of greatness, economic expansion, tough laws, tough judges, strong
values, respect for the flag and our institutions. George Bush will
lead us to the 21st century, a century that will be of hope and
peace. Ronald Reagan and George Bush saved America from decline. We
changed America. ... George Bush has the experience, and with me,
the future -- a future committed to our family, a future committed
to the freedom.
   Bentsen: ... Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen offer you
experienced, tempered, capable leadership to meet those challenges
of the future. ... America can't just coast into the future,
clinging to the past. This race is too close. The competition is

<HEAD>Lawless Denies Negotiating With Iranians on Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. government employee, emerging as
a mystery man in reports of fresh Reagan administration efforts to
free American hostages in Lebanon, denied he tried to negotiate a
prisoner release with Iranian figures.
   Richard Lawless, president of a trade and investment consulting
firm, on Wednesday sought to refute assertions by former Iranian
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr that he has been working on the
hostage problem behind the scenes on behalf of the administration.
   In doing so, Lawless, 44, echoed statements made earlier by
White House and State Department officials seeking to knock down
Bani-Sadr's allegations. Administration spokesmen have said Lawless
is not a government employee and has not been carrying out any kind
of mission on behalf of the United States.
   President Reagan and his aides steadfastly denied all reports
that the U.S. government is negotiating directly with the Iranians
on the hostage situation.
   Speaking through the co-owner of his firm, U.S.-Asia, Lawless
said: ``I categorically deny and state for the record that I am
involved either directly or indirectly in any discussions or
negotiations with any party related to attempts to secure the
release of hostages in Lebanon.''
   Lawless also said, ``I have never in my entire life had any
direct or indirect contact with any Iranian government officials or
any Iranian nationals claiming to represent the Iranian government
or any Iranian related interests.''
   On Tuesday, Bani-Sadr said in Paris that Lawless had negotiated
in behalf of Vice President George Bush with a representative of
Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, in an attempt to get
American hostages liberated.
   Told of the denials at an interview with The New York Times on
Wednesday in Paris, Bani-Sadr amended his account, saying he no
longer was certain Lawless was involved in the talks, but that ``it
was probably him.''
   Speaking on behalf of Lawless on Wednesday, U.S.-Asia co-owner
Therese Shaheen said the company felt Lawless's reputation ``had
been harmed'' by the Bani-Sadr allegations made in the wake of the
release earlier this week of hostage Mithileshwar Singh, an
Indian-born U.S. resident.
   ``The story here is, why are the Iranians fabricating this
story,'' she said. ``It's the biggest hoax since ... whatever.''
   Meanwhile, Reagan said again Wednesday that he did not foresee
any new hostage releases following the liberation of Singh.
   ``We desperately are hoping, continuing to try,'' he said.
   ``I've never been able to explain ... the Iranians, what their
strategies are and what they do,'' he told reporters. ``But
obviously we could not do any negotiating with them unless and
until the hostages are released.''
   Last week, an Israeli newspaper, The Nation, said U.S.
government officials were engaged in secret talks with Iranians in
Geneva aimed at setting the hostages free and improving relations
between Washington and Tehran.
   Bani-Sadr also said a shipment of arms furnished by the United
States was destined for Iran.
   ``Those charges are not true. None of them, top to bottom,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday. ``Bani-Sadr
is full of beans.''
   Lawless also denied that ``I have any active relationship with
anyone on the staff of Vice President Bush or the Bush campaign
organization which relates in any way to this or any similar
issue.''
   Lawless worked for the CIA at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, South
Korea, between 1973 and 1975, the same years that Bush's national
security adviser, Donald Gregg, served with the CIA at that
mission, The Washington Times quoted sources as saying.
   Gregg, however, has seen Lawless fewer than a half-dozen times
since 1975, and only in social settings, the paper quoted its
sources as saying.
   In addition, The New York Times quoted an unidentified former
government official as saying Lawless had worked in the CIA's
operations directorate until several years ago.
   Bill Devine, a CIA spokesman, said, ``We never confirm or deny
CIA allegations of employment.''
   The State Department's Biographic Register said in its 1974
edition that Lawless, 42, had worked as an ``area analyst'' for the
Pentagon and the State Department, starting in June 1972. Ms.
Shaheen said Lawless had assignments at embassies in Seoul, Tokyo
and Vienna, Austria.
   Ms. Shaheen said, ``We showed Richard's passport, plane tickets
and so forth'' in an attempt to dissuade CBS News from reporting
his purported activities on behalf of the hostages, but she noted
that the network had broadcast the report earlier in the week.
   ``He couldn't possibly have been there'' taking part in any
discussions about the hostages, she said. ``So Bani-Sadr said he
(Lawless) knows a couple people in the Bush campaign. ... It was
like, two and two make a thousand. ... We think it is politically
inspired by Iran.''
   Bush spokesmen have said Lawless has no relationship with Bush
or with his campaign.

<HEAD>Man Fed Up With Speeders Arrested for Building Speed Bumps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who said he was fed up with cars
speeding out of a high-school parking lot has been arrested for
building two speed bumps at an entrance.
   ``It was the most unique response I've seen to a problem,''
Fairfax County police Lt. Justin B. Murphy said Wednesday.
``However, it's illegal.''
   Tom Alsop, 34, was arrested Tuesday night and charged with
destruction of public property. He is to appear in court Oct. 28,
and faces 12 months in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted.
   ``I didn't pursue the right channels. I was basically spinning
my wheels,'' Alsop said. ``In hindsight, maybe it was a stupid
thing to do. We don't want anything big, we just want a little
help.''
   Alsop, who runs a carpet cleaning business near W.T. Woodson
High School, said he sees students speed out of the lot every day.
   They also perform ``burnouts'' by pouring oil on the road and
spinning their tires until smoke is generated, he said.
   ``At 2 o'clock every day, you get a burnout session,'' he said.
   Alsop installed a chain-link fence on his property last year
after a station wagon landed wheels-up in his yard.
   Alsop said he has complained about the students' driving to
school officials four times during the last three years to no
avail. So he decided to take action himself.
   The 5-foot-long-by-2-inch-high bumps were easy to build, Alsop
said.
   ``Take hot asphalt, pour it on the ground and whack it with a
shovel,'' he said.
   Alsop removed the bumps after the police arrived.
   ``These were just little bumps,'' Alsop said. ``I didn't think I
was doing any harm.''
   Woodson Principal Charles E. Billak said a staff member has been
assigned to monitor the problem. Three or four students lost their
privilege of driving to school last year after being caught doing
burnouts, Billak said.
   ``Automobiles are a problem,'' he said. ``We could do without
them.''

   The crowd was rowdy. Throughout the vice
presidential debate, the candidates were greeted with derisive
laughter and raucous cheers from alternating sides of an auditorium
calculatedly divided evenly between Republicans and Democrats, down
to the very last partisan.
   Throughout it all Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle doggedly stuck to
their podiums, exchanging occasional glares.
   ``It sure wasn't hermetically sealed,'' laughed Ed Touhy, who
produced the debate program for a bipartisan commission. ``For a
while, I was afraid they were going to rush the stage.''
   Both candidates and workers had spent the week in intense
preparation over the smallest details, and the training was
apparent from the time the two candidates strode purposefully on
stage in matching dark suits and similar striped ties.
   Quayle's sole concession to informality was a foot propped
casually on his podium, while Bentsen stubbornly gripped a pen in
his right hand, occasionally stabbing the air to underscore a point.
   The debate started slowly, but tension between the candidates
grew, capped when Bentsen glared at Quayle and said: ``Senator, you
are no Jack Kennedy.''
   The two candidates shook hands at the beginning and end, but
there was little warmth in between, and the crowd paid scant
attention to repeated pleas from moderator Judy Woodruff, of the
``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' television program, to react less
noisily.
   The candidates generally stared stonily into space during the
demonstrations, picking up where they left off after it subsided.
   ``I'm wondering if the rowdiness of the crowd doesn't dictate
that future debates will be held in television studios rather than
a public auditorium,'' Fouhy said later. ``It was a pretty rowdy
crowd.''
   The candidates occasionally had some tensions with their
questioners also.
   Pressed repeatedly to give his qualifications for president,
Quayle at one point snapped ``I think this is the fourth time I've
had this question.''
   No, he was told, just the third.
   Bentsen, pressed to explain a fund-raising tactic, stiffened a
bit before saying ``I don't find it embarrassing at all.''
   Organizers made no apologies for the stiffness of the
arrangements, telling reporters it was their job to produce good
television. And that's precisely what came out _ a television
program staged as artfully as a sitcom.
   ``This is a television program, and we've got some of the best
production people in the world doing it,'' Fouhy said. ``You direct
a television program so people watching at home have a good idea
what's happening.''
   The League of Women Voters originally was to sponsor the second
presidential debate, next week in Los Angeles, but pulled out
charging the candidates exercised too much control over the format
and turned the event into a ``charade.''
   That sort of criticism, insisted Fouhy, was ``a lot of
nonsense.''
   ``I'm delighted that it went well,'' Fouhy said. ``There was
real substance. This was not a battle of the network sound bites.''
   The show will go on. Saws and hammers came out within minutes of
the debate's close, dismantling a stage that had been shipped to
Omaha from Winston-Salem, N.C., and the first debate between
Michael Dukakis and George Bush.
   Next stop is Los Angeles and the final presidential debate.

   Beverly Hills residents threw tarpaulins over
their Porsches and Ferraris and others stayed indoors Wednesday as
the state prepared a sticky aerial bombardment of Mediterranean
fruit fly pesticide.
   But low clouds late Wednesday grounded three helicopters that
were set to spray Malathion over a 35-square-mile swath of homes
and businesses west of downtown, including sections of Beverly
Hills, to stop a burgeoning infestation of the crop-destroying pest.
   The spraying was rescheduled for Thursday night, said William
Edwards, chief deputy to Los Angeles County's agricultural
commissioner.
   The target area is densely packed with homes and businesses.
Forty Medflies have been found in yards since Sept. 26, indicating
a serious infestation that, if allowed to spread, could threaten
crops worth $8 billion a year statewide, authorities said.
   While the most exclusive residential sections of Beverly Hills,
including shaded streets dotted with movie stars' mansions, were
not included in the spraying area, many of the community's
expensive shops and opulent apartment buildings fell into the
target zone, along with other sections of Los Angeles and other
municipalities with homes ranging from modest bungalows to estates.
   The nearest commercial crops are dozens of miles away from the
spray area, but the pest can spread rapidly. Medflies lay their
eggs under the skin of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables,
hatching maggots that destroy the crop.
   The last serious infestation, in 1980 and 1981, cost California
farmers an estimated $100 million. ``We need to get this done as
quickly as possible,'' Edwards said of the spraying.
   State experts say the spraying could cause inconvenience, but no
health hazard, as the Malathion in the small concentrations used is
harmless to warm-blooded animals.
   However, the pesticide is mixed with a sweet, sticky corn syrup
bait that can damage car paint.
   Ron Ferraro, who runs Scandinavian Auto Body, scrambled to find
tarpaulins or garage space for a fleet of Alpha Romeos in Beverly
Hills. ``You're looking at about $7,500 in refinishing that would
have to be done,'' Ferraro said.
   Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy said the fight to save the
state's farm industry knows no economic boundaries. ``We're
encouraging people to cover up their Rolls Royces just like they
would cover up their Pintos,'' he said.
   Among the cities and the sections of Los Angeles in the area are
Culver City, Palms, Baldwin Hills and West Hollywood.
   Members of the California Conservation Corps started passing out
flyers notifying residents of the spraying Monday, and there have
been news reports all week, but some objected they hadn't been
warned in time.
   West Hollywood Mayor Helen Albert, in a letter to state
agriculture officials, complained the city hadn't been given enough
time to warn its residents or assess possible health hazards.
   Responded Edwards: ``They should be mad at the people who caused
this (infestation), and that's the people who brought the
(contaminated) fruit in. We're trying to protect the state's
biggest industry, and that's agriculture. If we don't do this,
farmers are going to have to use a lot more pesticide and fruit is
going to cost more.''
   The Medfly is native to Central America, Hawaii and other
tropical areas. Most California infestations are believed to start
with flies unwittingly brought home by tourists in illegally
transported fruit, or in fruit mailed from Hawaii.
   The anti-Medfly strategy is two-fold. First, the population is
knocked down with the Malathion bait, which remains active about a
week. Then, millions of specially bred sterile flies are released
so the surviving wild flies mate harmlessly.

   Rhinelander residents apparently are a
little nuts about acorns.
   When state forestry officials put out a call for acorns, little
did they know it would bring an avalanche of nuts brought in by
children, families and retired folks.
   The state Department of Natural Resources quit buying the red
oak acorns at $20 bushel after people brought to the Rhinelander
ranger station more than twice as many as originally needed for the
state's three nurseries.
   ``I was shocked. I don't think anybody in their wildest dreams
expected this,'' Timothy Mulhern, a forester in Rhinelander who set
up the acorn collection station, said Wednesday.
   He said the collection drive began last month, and people
brought 1,182 bushels of acorns to the station in just three days.
   As the acorns began to roll in, officials decided to increase
the number of acorns they would plant to 700 bushels, but people
from as far away as Michigan continued to haul their acorns to
Rhinelander, in north-central Wisconsin.
   Eventually, the acorns filled four garage stalls waist-high,
Mulhern said. Some people brought their children to see the nuts,
he said.
   ``It's like a giant squirrel stored all the acorns in the world
right here for winter,'' one DNR official said.

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who has

scrambled eggs, sausage and coffee.
   Koop smiled and laughed good-naturedly as his fellow diners _
most of whom were doctors or health officials _ teased him about
the All-American meal.
   But when a reporter later asked about the breakfast, Koop's
familiar stern demeanor reappeared.
   ``When you're my age and in my situation _ your blood
cholesterol and triglyceride levels are normal _ you can indulge
now and then,'' Koop said following the breakfast in his honor at
the University of Minnesota-Duluth.
   People with hyperlipemia _ too much fat in the blood _ have

<HEAD>Emperor Hirohito Discharges More Blood, Fever Remains High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors expressed fears that transfusions may be
causing emperor Hirohito's fever and pulse rate to rise, but gave
him more blood this morning as his internal bleeding continued.
   Emperor Hirohito received 0.4 pints of blood in a transfusion
this morning after discharging a small amount of blood, according
to palace officials.
   It was the 14th-straight day transfusions have been given to the
87-year-old emperor, who has been bedridden since internal
hemorrhaging caused him to vomit blood on Sept. 19.
   Kenji Maeda, head of the general affairs department of the
Imperial Household Agency, told reporters the emperor's temperature
was 100.58 degrees as of 9:00 a.m. Wednesday morning his fever was
98.96 degrees.
   ``We cannot rule out the possibility that the emperor's fever
was caused by internal inflammation in the upper digestive tract,
or by (the series of) blood transfusions, or both'' Maeda quoted
Akira Takagi, the emperor's chief physician, as saying.
   Hirohito has so far received a total of 11.98 pints in
transfusions, well above the normal amount of blood circulating in
his body, according to news reports.
   Doctors halted a blood transfusion being given to the emperor
Wednesday afternoon before it was complete because of concern over
his high temperature and rising pulse rate.
   Hirohito's temperature and pulse rate rose sharply Wednesday as
doctors administered the transfusion in an attempt to ``help
overcome anemia and improve his overall physical condition,'' Maeda
said.
   The world's longest-reigning monarch has continued to discharge
small amounts of blood intermittently since the onset of the crisis.
   He has been unable to take solid food except for two small
fragments of ice and a few spoonfuls of porridge since falling
sick. He is being fed intravenously.
   News reports have said Hirohito has cancer, but palace officials
have refused to confirm or deny them and have urged the media to
refrain from making such speculation.

<TEXT>
   The Sandinista party has pushed
through a law that grants President Daniel Ortega sweeping powers
to make arrests and silence news media during a state of emergency.
   Also Wednesday, the government banned Nicaraguans from receiving
any type of official U.S. aid.
   The new Emergency Law went into effect immediately after it was
approved by the leftist Sandinistas' 61-seat majority in the
96-seat National Assembly. It allows the president to declare a
state of emergency and restrict civil liberties for reasons of war,
economic crisis or national disasters.
   In a statement, the opposition Popular Social Christian Party
decried the law as ``an unrestrained concentration of extraordinary
powers'' that could render Ortega ``an absolute dictator.''
   A National State of Emergency decree was in effect from March
1982 until shortly after a Central American peace plan was signed
by the region's presidents in August 1987.
   Under the new law, the president can declare a state of
emergency that permits the government to temporarily confiscate
privately-owned businesses and vehicles. It empowers the executive
to suspend broadcast and print media and communications services
``when necessary to maintain public order.''
   It also gives the government sweeping powers of arrest and
preventive detention of individuals deemed ``dangerous persons''
and requires all individuals traveling in war zones to carry
identification documents.
   Meanwhile, the External Cooperation Ministry announced a ban on
``all cash or in-kind assistance connected with funds approved by
the U.S. government,'' including humanitarian aid for victims of
the seven-year civil war between the government and U.S.-backed
rebels known as Contras.
   Ortega also sent a bill to the Assembly that would make receipt
of any official U.S. aid ``crimes against the internal and external
security of the state.'' The assembly will consider the legislation
beginning Friday.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Wednesday the Reagan administration was considering seeking
congressional approval for release of $16.5 million in stockpiled
military aid for the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Also Wednesday, Nicaragua's Interior Ministry protested a report
by the country's sole opposition newspaper, La Prensa, that three
activists with the Confederation of Trade Union Unity were fatally
shot Sunday by three men wearing Sandinista army uniforms in Leon,
about 45 miles west of Managua.
   The ministry said the report Tuesday ``brazenly falsified the
truth of the facts'' to make it appear those slain were ``victims
of government repression because of their activities'' in the labor
group.
   The ministry statement listed other examples of reporting in La
Prensa it considered biased or erroneous and ordered the newspaper
to print the government statement in today's editions.
   ``It is evident that the principal objective of this campaign is
to offer the Reagan administration those elements that will permit
it to accuse our government of being a violator of the most
fundamental human rights,'' the ministry statement said.

the Detroit News.
   Paul joined the newspaper in 1985 after serving as vice
president of Liberty University.

<HEAD>Environment Group Sues Government to Halt CFC Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group says it is suing the
Environmental Protection Agency to force the government to order a
complete end to the use of chemicals that destroy the earth's
protective ozone layer.
   The suit by the Natural Resources Defense Council challenges the
adequacy of the partial cutbacks that EPA ordered for five major
chlorofluorocarbon compounds, or CFC's, on Aug. 1.
   Those regulations paralleled provisions of the 1987 treaty by
major producing nations pledging themselves to a 50 percent
reduction in CFC output by 1998.
   ``The United States is the single largest contributor to
world-wide emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals,'' responsible
for about 30 percent of global use, David Doniger, an attorney for
the council, said Wednesday. ``We have a responsibility to clean up

   Dan Quayle withstood his mid-term exam, but
the Democrats aren't relenting in their campaign to flunk the
Republican vice presidential nominee.
   In 90 minutes of pressurized debate with Democrat Lloyd Bentsen,
Quayle held his own. There were no significant blunders by either
man in the running mate debate.
   An ABC News poll immediately after the debate found 51 percent
thought Bentsen had won, 27 percent said Quayle, and 22 percent
thought it a tie. The margin of error in the survey of 637 people
was 4.5 percentage points.
   Republican Quayle faced the more difficult debate assignment
because he is the candidate found by public opinion polls to be a
drag on his ticket. He has come under constant campaign attack. And
he faced the tougher set of sometimes repetitive debate questions.
   Bentsen fills a more traditional No. 2 role. He isn't an issue.
He is, rather, a bridge between Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis and his party's more conservative branch.
   At the start of the Omaha, Neb., debate, Quayle was asked to
defend his credentials and qualifications for the vice presidency
and, if need be, the presidency itself. That meshed with the theme
Bentsen came to stress _ that the debate really dealt with the
presidency itself, and whether he or Quayle is the better man to
take on the job if necessary.
   He and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis argue
every day that the answer on Quayle is no. And the debate had
hardly ended before Dukakis repeated that theme, telling a Boston
rally that Bentsen had proved again he could take over the
presidency if he has to, while Quayle could not.
   That points to a campaign theme that is sure to be part of the
Democratic litany until Nov. 8. Post-debate comments, predictably,
fit that pattern.
   ``Neither scored a knockout, but Lloyd Bentsen looked and
sounded more presidential,'' said Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois, a former candidate for his party's prize.
   Quayle clearly had done his homework for the debate test. When
the first questioner recited criticism of his military and academic
records, and disparaging comments by Republicans, Quayle said the
question behind it all was of his qualifications to be vice
president ``and in the case of tragedy, whether I'm qualified to be
president.''
   The Indiana senator, 41, said it isn't a question of age but of
accomplishments and experience, insisted that he has both,
especially on national security, jobs and education, and the
federal budget.
   ``On each one of those issues I have more experience than does
the governor of Massachusetts,'' he said. And repeatedly, ``I am
prepared ... to lead this country'' if the GOP ticket wins and that
becomes necessary.
   Quayle stuck to that line all night.
   The panel of questioners, three television and one print
journalist, went back to the topic repeatedly, three times by
asking what first step Quayle would take if he ever became
president. That's an unanswerable question, since no vice president
could know what he'd do without knowing the circumstances of his
succession. It was not asked of Bentsen.
   Each time, Quayle went back to his formula, claiming strength on
the big three issues.
   But he varied it enough to trigger the debate's sharpest
exchange, saying that he has as much experience now as John F.
Kennedy had when he ran for president.
   ``Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy, Jack
Kennedy was a friend of mine,'' said Bentsen. ``Senator, you're no
Jack Kennedy.''
   ``That was really uncalled for, senator,'' an angry Quayle
retorted.
   Kennedy had served 14 years in Congress, eight in the Senate
before he became president in 1960. Quayle has been a senator for
eight years, and served four in the House.
   Bentsen took a share of sharp questions, on his political
fund-raising tactics and also about his differences with Dukakis on
such topics as aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, the death penalty and
gun control. The Texas senator favors the first two, opposes gun
control. Dukakis holds opposite positions. Bentsen said they agree
on most issues, then changed the subject.
   Quayle tried to make make an issue of that, saying he wouldn't
try to defend a liberal like Dukakis, either.
   But he remained the focus. And he is certain to remain a prime
target in the five weeks until election day.

   Military President Augusto Pinochet lost
a referendum that would have allowed him to stay in power until
1997, government and opposition returns showed Thursday.
   The defeat sets the stage for open elections next year.
   In a speech broadcast nationwide on television and radio,
Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez, formally conceded Pinochet's
defeat at 2:40 a.m. (1:40 a.m. EDT).
   ``We abide by the results, which the country already knows,''
Fernandez said.
   Earlier, Air Force Commander General Fernando Matthei, a member
of the law-making military junta, said: ``It seem to me that the
`no' (vote) has won.''
   ``We are calm. We are going to analyze the situation,'' Matthei
added as he entered the downtown government palace at 1 a.m. for an
emergency meeting with Pinochet, the four-man junta and the
15-member Cabinet.
   Shortly after Matthei's statement, the Interior Ministry at 2:10
a.m. announced for the first time substantial voting returns that
showed the vote against Pinochet's continued rule prevailing. It
earlier had said Pinochet was winning.
   With 15,969 of the country's 22,248 voting tables reporting, the
ministry counted 2,754,805 votes, or 53.3 percent, against
Pinochet, and 2,290,972 votes, or 44.3 percent, supporting the
president.
   There were also 53,292 blank votes and 68,108 votes voided for
being wrongly marked.
   An earlier opposition tally gave the ``no'' vote an even wider
margin with Pinochet losing, 57.8 percent to 39.9 percent.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the Christian Democratic Party and
spokesman for the coalition, declared, ``It's clear that the
majority of Chileans have voted no.''
   On Wednesday in balloting that was peaceful and heavily
attended, Chileans voted on a proposal by Pinochet and other
military commanders that he remain president until 1997. The
right-wing, 72-year-old army chief seized power in a bloody coup in
1973 that ousted the 3-year-old elected government of President
Salvador Allende, a Marxist who died during the takeover.
   If he had won, Pinochet would have assumed a new 8-year term in
March. By losing, an open presidential election is to be held late
next year and the winner would assume power in March 1990, with
Pinochet remaining in power until then.
   Earlier, military patrols in armored personnel carriers and
trucks with mounted machine guns were seen circulating in
working-class neighborhoods and slums _ where anti-Pinochet
sentiment traditionally runs high _ that ring the capital. A few
hundred people danced in the streets of La Victoria slum in
southern Santiago, waving banners and celebrating an anticipated
``no'' victory.
   ``We all voted no, because we are repressed,'' said one
participant, 50-year-old construction worker Jose Garrido.
   Jorge Zincke, military commander for the Santiago area, reported
scattered incidents after the voting, which he said were being
controlled by police. He said anti-government demonstrators erected
barricades in the streets of San Bernardo, south of the capital,
and Puente Alto, to the southeast.
   He said six people were arrested for carrying arms and a public
bus was burned and its driver beaten.
   Santiago's streets were mainly empty as most Chileans heeded
opposition calls to stay at home.
   Pinochet said earlier in an interview broadcast by Radio
Cooperativa of Santiago, ``So far everything is calm, but I've got
some information that leaves me thinking. There are some people who
have seen individuals wearing ski-masks.'' He gave no details.
   Leftist urban guerrillas commonly employ ski masks, but both of
Chile's guerrilla groups have publicly announced a truce until
after the voting day.
   A huge turnout among the 7.4 million registered voters slowed
balloting at many polling places and could delay definitive
tallies, authorities said. Voting tables started closing at 5 p.m.
and the counting began.
   Foreign observers said the plebiscite appeared to be open and
honestly conducted.
   Former President Oswaldo Hurtado of Ecuador, an observer, said:
``What I have seen is Chileans being able to cast their votes
freely and in private.''
   Official returns from the National Election Service are not
expected until Friday.
   Voting is mandatory and those who don't vote can be fined up to
22,000 pesos, or about $80.
   In Santiago, the capital city where more than one-third of the
nation's 12 million people live, some voters showed up an hour
before polls began opening at 8 a.m. Lines more than a mile long
had formed by midmorning, under bright sunlight in the Southern
Hemisphere spring.
   Pinochet, smiling and wearing a beige civilian suit, voted at a
downtown Santiago station.

<HEAD>Public Booze Ban Planned To Curb Rowdy Youths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVENTRY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it will ban public
drinking in eight English cities next year in an experimental
crackdown on so-called ``lager louts'' _ rowdy youths who get drunk
on American-style beer.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said the bans would take effect
early next year in Coventry, Bath, Farnborough, Chester, St.
Austell, Scarborough, Aldershot and Newquay.
   ``The government does not want to restrict personal freedom,''
Hurd told a legal conference Wednesday. ``But it is not clever,
masculine or attractive to drink yourself into a state where you
break windows or hit or stab a policemen.''
   The two-year experimental program calls for local governments to
work with the Home Office to enact by-laws empowering the courts to
levy $170 fines against people who drink alcohol outdoors.
   The measure follows a wave of summer violence in Britain's
suburbs and rural towns by young men, most of them between the ages
of 18 and 26, who gather on weekends and drink on the streets or in
local pubs.
   They have been blamed for brawls, vandalism and attacks on
unarmed police called to disperse the drunken, rowdy crowds.
   Police estimate dozens of officers have been injured in
confrontations nationwide with the so-called ``lager louts.'' Lager
is a pale, American-style beer favored by the young as opposed to
the dark, traditional ``bitter'' English beer.
   Traditionally, Britons have been allowed to consume alcohol in
parks or on the streets, particularly during the afternoon when
pubs are closed.
   But the 73-year-old pub-closing law was repealed Aug. 22, giving
people who want a pint of beer in the afternoon the option to drink
indoors.
   Hurd said Wednesday he had misgivings about making drinking on
the streets a criminal offense.
   ``But I concluded that the ... distress caused to ordinary
citizens by groups of mainly young people becoming drunk and
behaving badly was such that it was worth trying a by-law,'' he
said.
   In a meeting today with the Chief Police Officers Association in
the northern city of Preston, Hurd was to be asked to endorse
another experimental program: installing video cameras in downtown
areas to keep on eye on drunken youths.

<TEXT>
   A judge has declared a mistrial in a $2.75
million suit filed by a television cameraman against pop music
singer Prince, citing a newspaper report of a $100,000 out-of-court
settlement offer.
   Common Pleas Judge Frank J. Gorman admonished The (Cleveland)
Plain Dealer for revealing the rejected offer and said the story
would prejudice the trial in the lawsuit by photographer James R.
Gates.
   When Prince's lawyer Terrence J. Kenneally asked Gorman to
declare a mistrial Wednesday, Gates' lawyer, Jeffrey M. Embleton,
said he would not object.
   ``I have no alternative but to declare a mistrial and dismiss
the jury,'' said Gorman, who did not question the jurors about
whether they had read the story.
   The lawyers told the judge they had heard the settlement offer
reported on radio stations Wednesday morning.
   Gorman called the reporting of the offer ``totally
irresponsible.'' He said he would ask the Cleveland Bar Association
to investigate and added that he was considering filing contempt of
court charges against the paper.
   A newspaper spokesman referred questions to Managing Editor
Thomas Greer, who was unavailable for comment early today.
   After confirming for a reporter that Gates had rejected a
$100,000 settlement offer, Gorman called the newspaper Tuesday
night and threatened to hold it in contempt of court if the offer
was published, The Plain Dealer reported today.
   Gates, a photographer for television station WEWS, said he was
slugged by one of Prince's bodyguards in an alley Sept. 5, 1984, as
he tried to photograph Prince entering a nightclub.
   Gates said his back, neck, arm, wrist and leg were injured and
that he suffered emotionally and was seeing a psychiatist.
   Gorman did not set a new trial date.

<HEAD>Priest Facing 20 Years For Drug Trafficking Protests Innocence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest who was caught
with 46 pounds of cocaine says he is innocent of drug trafficking
and insists he will remain a priest for the rest of his life.
   Father Jose Luis Gil Fernandez, who turned 58 on Wednesday, said
he felt ``tranquil'' after a Venezuelan public prosecutor requested
a 20 year sentence this week for Gil for trafficking in drugs.
   The prosecutor, Pablo Gonzalez, also asked for 15 years in jail
for Juan Rojano Martinez, a former priest whom Gil implicated as
the man who forced him to deal in drugs.
   Gonzalez requested a stiffer sentence for Gil because he
allegedly used his status as a minister of God to facilitate the
drug dealing.
   ``I am totally innocent. I am going to wait all this out and I
will continue being a priest for the rest of my life,'' Gil said
prior to his second hearing before Judge Aura Chaparro of the 40th
First Circuit Penal Tribunal in Caracas.
   The silver-haired priest clutched a red-bound Bible in his hand
and had a small silver cross pinned to his navy blue knit vest.
   Gil was arrested last April by Venezuelan intelligence police in
Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas as he tried to
smuggle the cocaine onto a plane bound for Madrid.
   Rojano, who left the priesthood 27 years ago, and his wife
Graciela were arrested in their Caracas residence hours after Gil.
   Police found 180 grams of cocaine and cash in the house,
Rojano's lawyer, Hugo Albarran, said prior to the hearing.
   Gil is Spanish-born but was the parish priest of San Mateo, 36
miles west of Caracas, for 30 years. According to Gil's lawyer,
Edoardo Petricone Chiarilli, he has given up the parish post since
his arrest.
   Gil is apparently the first priest ever to be tried for drug
trafficking.
   Petricone said Gil is pleading innocent because he was coerced
into carrying drugs by Rojano. Albarran said Rojano is pleading
innocent because he was falsely accused by Gil.
   According to Petricone, Gil inadvertently got involved in
trafficking in 1984 when he carried a package of unknown content to
Spain as a favor to Rojano.
   Rojano and Gil have known each other for 20 years, according to
Rojano's lawyer Hugo Albarran.
   Upon Gil's return, Rojano notified him the package contained
cocaine and threatened to ``expose (Gil) to public shame'' if he
refused to carry more drugs, Petricone said.
   He said the only other times the priest carried cocaine to Spain
were in January 1988 and again last April, when he was arrested.
   Judge Chaparro, who is stepping in for vacationing Judge
Francisco Caracciolo Lamus, indicated that a decision on Gil and
Rojano will not be made until November at the earliest.
   Drug trafficking carries a sentence of up to 30 years in
Venezuela.

   Chileans grew frustrated with long lines
that snaked outside polling stations, but many believed the
national referendum on whether Gen. Augusto Pinochet should
continue as president would be fair and accurate.
   The Interior Ministry conceded early today that Pinochet had
lost the referendum. Voters had been asked to decide whether
Pinochet, who seized power in a 1973 military coup, should continue
to rule this South American nation until 1997.
   Open elections for a new president are to be held next year.
   During Wednesday's balloting, many Chileans seemed confident
that their vote would count.
   ``I'll respect the results even if Pinochet wins,'' said Jose
Casanova, a 63-year-old retired farmer, standing outside a polling
station in a working-class northern suburb. ``I think Pinochet will
respect the results even if he loses.''
   ``Anyone who wants to can vote `no.' That doesn't happen in Cuba
and a lot of other countries,'' said Geronima Lopez Rodrigo, 54,
who was waiting her turn in the affluent Providencia neighborhood
of Santiago. ``We have a beautiful democracy, with order and
discipline.''
   About 7.4 million people were registered to vote. Voting is
mandatory, and turnout was heavy across this narrow country wedged
between the snow-capped Andes mountains and the Pacific.
   Anyone who did not vote soon after polls opened at 8 a.m. risked
a long wait under a glaring spring sun.
   Men removed their sport coats and sweaters, and women, standing
in separate lines, fanned themselves or held kerchiefs over their
heads. Government television said two elderly voters, in the cities
of La Serena and Coyhaique, suffered heart attacks and died just
before or after voting.
   But few people grumbled, and even fewer went home without voting.
   ``I took three buses to get here,'' said Carmen Reyes, at a
southern Santiago polling place.
   Housewife Sonia Azoca in the northern neighborhood of Conchali
said: ``I've been here half an hour. I'll probably be here an hour
more. However long it takes, I'll be here.''
   National police in white suspenders, holsters and carrying
batons were posted at each of the 1,000 polling stations
nationwide. Otherwise, the military was barely visible in the
capital's streets, sidewalks and parks, which were practically
deserted.
   After voting, most people took the advice of the government, the
opposition and the Roman Catholic Church. They went home.
   Not one of more than a dozen voters interviewed doubted the vote
count would be fast and accurate.
   ``Fraud is impossible,'' said Fabiola Escuer, 24. ``Both sides
are counting the vote and there are observers from many countries.''
   Election laws provide for pollwatchers from both pro-government
and opposition parties. An estimated 500 foreign observers were on
hand in the capital and provincial cities.

   Tests indicate that soul singer James Brown
had the hallucinogenic drug PCP in his system when he was arrested
following a two-state car chase, a prosecutor said.
   Brown, 55, was charged with driving under the influence Sept. 24
after the singer led police on a chase that started and ended in
Augusta, Ga.
   Brown also was charged in South Carolina with two assault counts
and failing to stop for police.
   A chemical analysis of Brown's blood revealed the presence of
PCP, Circuit Solicitor Robert J. Harte said Wednesday.
   Brown in the past has maintained he has never used the drug, but
his attorney said the entertainer began treatment in Athens, Ga.,
this week for ``substance abuse.''
   Brown's attorney Albert `Buddy'' Dallas refused to identify the
drug, and referred to Brown's problem as related to
``stress-control.''
   Brown was placed on probation this summer after pleading no
contest to a PCP possession charge and pleading guilty to resisting
arrest and carrying a pistol.
   But Brown said he has never used the hallucinogenic drug and
said the PCP was planted on him.

   A 10-year-old girl from Michigan
arrived in this nation to an official government welcome as guest
of military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, her pen pal in recent
months.
   Sarah York and her mother, Pauline, of Negaunee, Mich., arrived
at Torrijos International Airport near Panama City late Wednesday
on a commercial flight from Miami.
   They will stay until Tuesday, visiting an agricultural fair and
meeting Noriega and other Panamanian officials. The meeting with
Noriega is set for Thursday.
   Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler, has been indicted in the
United States on drug trafficking charges. He has withstood U.S.
economic sanctions against Panama aimed at forcing him to resign.
   ``The girl has risen above the behavior of the adults that
actually direct U.S. politics,'' said Defense Forces spokesman Maj.
Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo.
   Lopez Grimaldo said the girl first wrote Noriega on March 3
after she saw him interviewed on television. She asked him to
recommend books on Central American politics and history.
   In other letters, Sarah told the general she received good
grades in school and liked to read and play piano.

   Suriname's new president has asked France
and the Netherlands to help his nation halt recruitment of
mercenaries and arms shipments that he says are fortifying
anti-government rebels.
   President Ramsewak Shankar, whose January inauguration ended
seven years of military rule, told the 43rd U.N. General Assembly
in New York on Wednesday that Suriname ``has inherited serious
social and economic problems that could become a threat to our
national unity and political stability if not urgently addressed.''
   He said one problem involves about 10,000 refugees in eastern
Suriname who fled a guerrilla war by troops loyal to former private
Ronnie Brunswijk. He is a former bodyguard to Desi Bouterse, who
Shankar replaced in January after seven years of leftist military
rule.
   ``My government is making every effort to have dialogue to end
the insurgency, which has often resulted in violent acts off
terrorism,'' Shankar said Wednesday.
   Suriname, a small nation of 370,000 people north of Brazil, has
never directly accused the Netherlands or France of aiding the
insurrection.
   But Shankar said Wednesday that Suriname ``is faced with the
problem that the insurgents are aided and abetted by external
forces, whose chief aim is the continuation of violence through the
provision of arms and the recruitment and financing of
mercenaries.''
   He said his government is seeking help from France and the
Netherlands in stopping arms deliveries and recruitment of foreign
mercenaries.
   Brunswijk's forces have wide support among the 350,000-member
Surinamese expatriot community in the Netherlands.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle says he could take over as president if a tragedy made that
necessary, telling a debate audience the first thing he would do if
that happened is pray for himself and the country.
   The question dogged the 41-year-old senator from Indiana
throughout his debate Wednesday night with Democratic vice
presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, who from the beginning
maintained the key issue was who was best qualified to be president
_ not No. 2.
   Reporters putting the questions to the two candidates appeared
to agree, returning to it three times after moderator Judy Woodruff
opened the debate with a comment that, based on the experiences
since World War II, there is a 50-50 chance that Quayle or Bentsen
could be thrust into the Oval Office on a moment's notice.
   ``First, I'd say a prayer for myself and for the country that
I'm about to lead,'' Quayle said. ``And then I would assemble his
people and talk.''
   Bentsen, a 67-year-old senator from Texas, answered in more
general terms, saying the central issue was ``maturity of
judgment'' and ``breadth of experience.''
   He started to get specific at one point, saying, ``What has to
be done in a situation like that is to call in the joint ...'' but
was interrupted by audience reaction and never finished. The
reference may have been to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The audience reaction was in response to Bentsen's statement to
Quayle: ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.'' Quayle had said he has
as much experience in Congress as Kennedy did when he sought and
won the presidency in 1960.
   Quayle said he is prepared to carry out the duties of the
presidency ``not only because of my service in the Congress but
because of my ability to communicate and to lead.''
   ``It's not just age, it's accomplishments, it's experience,'' he
said, citing his authorship with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
of the Job Training Partnership Act for training unskilled and
workers and retraining displaced ones. ``I have far more experience
than many others that sought the office of vice president.''
   Expanding on what his first actions would be in reaction to the
fourth occasion in the debate when the question was posed, Quayle
said he would call in members of the Cabinet and the president's
White House advisers and ``talk to them and work with them.''
   ``I'll know them on a first-hand basis because I'm going to be
coordinating the drug effort, because as vice president, I'll sit
in on the National Security Council, because Vice President George
Bush is going to recreate the Space Council and I'll be in charge
of that,'' he said. ``I will have day-to-day activities with all
the people in government.''
   Bentsen didn't escape unscathed on the same issue.
   He was queried about the fairness of his and Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis' repeated campaign remarks
questioning Quayle's qualifications when Bentsen had unsuccessfully
sought the presidency in 1976 with less experience than Quayle has
now.
   ``I must say I didn't do a very good job of running for the
presidency,'' Bentsen said. ``But what we're looking at today is
trying to judge, once again, the breadth of experience and maturity
of someone taking on this kind of task.''

<HEAD>Highlights Of The Vice Presidential Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are highlights from Wednesday night's
vice presidential debate between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>QUAYLE QUALIFICATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle was asked four times about his qualifications for high
office, and responded that he is ``prepared to lead this country,''
if necessary. However, when he compared his experience with that of
John F. Kennedy, Bentsen shot back that he had known Kennedy and
``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE OTHER TARGETS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The debaters saved their best shots for the two presidential
candidates, George Bush and Michael Dukakis. ``George Bush has more
qualifications than Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen combined,''
Quayle said. Bentsen took aim at Bush's vote in favor of a plan to
curtail Social Security cost-of-living increases. He said the
Reagan administration had appointed high-level environmental
officials who were the equivalent of Bonnie and Clyde.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BENTSEN-DUKAKIS DIFFERENCES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bentsen was asked about his differences with Dukakis on such
issues as aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, the death penalty and gun
control. ``We agree on so many things, on the vast majority of the
issues,'' Bentsen replied. He said he and Dukakis agree on cutting
the budget deficit and on a trade policy that will ``stand tough
for America.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bentsen accused Quayle of voting eight times to cut benefits,
and said Bush cast a tie-breaking vote against a Social Security
cost-of-living increase. Quayle glaringly responded,``Senator
Bentsen, you know that I did not vote to cut Social Security eight
times.'' He said he had voted to delay cost-of-living adjustments
and that Bentsen himself had voted that way twice.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CLOSING STATEMENTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle said ``George Bush has the experience, and with me, the
future,'' and that the Democrats would ``take America backwards.''
He said ``the road of George Bush is the road to the future and it
comes to this: an America second to none, with visions of
greatness, tough laws, tough judges, strong values, respect for
flag and isntitutions.'' Bentsen said he and Dukakis believe the
``best of America is yet to come,'' but that ``putting the economy
on automatic pilot will not be sufficient. ... The nation will
fulfill its greatness but cannot afford to stand still.''

<TEXT>
   Foreign observers who watched as Chileans
decided whether Gen. Augusto Pinochet should remain as president
said the balloting appeared fair but frequently disorganized.
   ``What I have seen is Chileans being able to cast their votes
freely and in private ...,'' said Oswaldo Hurtado, former president
of Ecuado.
   The Interior Ministry said early today that a majority voted
against Pinochet remaining as president until 1997. New elections
are to be held next year.
   Opposition groups fearful of fraud by the government had urged
foreign dignitaries to monitor the vote. More than 500 politicians,
diplomats and a few celebrities _ including Nicaraguan actress
Bianca Jagger _ chose to do so.
   ``Some polling stations were badly organized. Some opened late
and consequently will have to remain open longer this evening, but
in general ... it has gone rather well,'' said Johanna May Weggen,
a European Parliament delegate from the Netherlands.
   Former presidents Adolfo Suarez of Spain and Misael Pastrana of
Colombia, and Bruce Babbitt, former governor of Arizona, led a
60-member delegation of the National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs based in Washington.
   They visited polling stations in Santiago and 10 other cities
but said they would not comment formally until a news conference
Friday.
   Some delegation members said privately they thought the vote was
free and open, and expected the tally also would be. They said
civilians, police and military guards at the polling stations were
friendly and helpful.
   The Puebla Institute, a Roman Catholic human rights group based
in Washington, reported signs of government-sponsored harassment in
recent days, such as a mass mailing apparently intended to mislead
voters into invalidating their registration cards.
   After touring polling stations Wednesday, however, the institute
issued a statement saying:
   ``Despite a climate of intimidation, assorted dirty tricks by
government supporters, extended delays in opening some polling
places, long lines to vote and other irregularities, Chileans in
great numbers turned out to vote today.
   ``Chileans are taking the first real step toward democracy in 15
years. We have heard much about Chile's `economic miracle'. Today,
we are witnessing the start of a `democracy miracle'.''

<TEXT>
   When they weren't sparring over who was
qualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency, Dan Quayle
and Lloyd Bentsen also locked horns over Social Security,
environmental protection, campaign finance and other issues in
their sole face-to-face campaign showdown.
   Here is a look at some of the major issues they argued over in
Wednesday night's debate:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>QUALIFICATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle asked to be judged by his experience on ``the three
biggest issues that are going to be confronting America in the next
presidency ... national security and arms control, jobs and
education, and the federal budget deficit.''
   He said his work in Congress, including his authorship of the
Job Training Partnership Act of 1983, has established his
credentials. ``On each one of those issues I have more experience
than does the governor of Massachusetts,'' said the 41-year-old
Quayle.
   But when the Republican said he was no younger than John F.
Kennedy when he ran for president, the 67-year-old Bentsen said he
knew Kennedy and ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bentsen said Quayle had ``voted eight times to cut the benefits
on Social Security.''
   ``That's wrong,'' said Quayle.
   Bentsen said the Reagan administration had tried repeatedly to
make deep cuts in Social Security, and Vice President George Bush
cast a tie-breaking vote in 1985 to freeze benefits. ``When you
talk about Social Security the people that are going to protect it
are the Democrats who brought forth that program,'' he said.
   But Quayle said Bentsen himself had voted twice to delay the
Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, and Dukakis had
supported a freeze at the national governors' conference. He said
what the Democrats ``try to do time and time again is to scare the
old people of this country.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENVIRONMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle, asked why he had voted ``two-thirds of the time''
against environmental protection legislation, said, ``I have a very
strong record on the environment in the United States Senate.'' He
said he voted for the Superfund and to override a Reagan veto of
the Clean Water Act.
   Quayle also blamed Dukakis for Boston Harbor's being ``the
dirtiest waterway in America.''
   Bentsen derided the ``late conversion'' to environmentalism and
charged, ``it was this administration, their administration, that
cut out the money early on to be able to clean up ... Boston
Harbor.'' He said the Democrats were responsible for the Superfund
and the Clean Air and Water acts.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POVERTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Asked why he had voted for cuts in school nutrition and against
expanding the childhood immunization program, Quayle said, ``This
administration and a George Bush administration will be committed
to eradicating poverty. Poverty hasn't gone up in this
administration. It hasn't gone down much either, and that means
that we have a challenge ahead of us.'' He said tax reform had
taken 6 million working poor families off the tax rolls.
   ``The poverty program we are going to concentrate on is creating
jobs and opportunities,'' said the Indiana senator.
   Bentsen charged Quayle was ``of no help at all'' in the recently
passed overhaul of welfare laws.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONTRA AID</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bentsen acknowledged disagreeing with his running mate on
military aid for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, but Bentsen said
he and Dukakis both support the Arias peace plan for Central
America, including diplomatic pressure on Nicaragua. ``I really
think we have to give peace a chance,'' he said.
   Quayle said a Dukakis administration would cut off aid to the
resistance in Nicaragua. He said Dukakis had also opposed the U.S.
military intervention in Grenada.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAMPAIGN FINANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Asked if he was embarrassed at being the Senate's biggest
recipient of contributions from political action committees,
Bentsen said he plays by the laws as they are, just like when
``you're paying taxes or you're playing a football game.''
   But Bentsen acknowledged his $10,000-a-plate ``breakfast club''
for lobbyists was ``a real doozie'' of a mistake which he quickly
ended.
   Quayle said, ``He disbanded the club, but he's still got the
money,'' since most of the lobbyists forked over donations anyway
to the Senate Finance Committee chairman's campaign.
   Bentsen said Quayle had pocketed more than a quarter-million
dollars in speech honoraria from special interest groups.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEREGULATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Quayle defended the Reagan-Bush efforts to relax government
regulation of business, and denied it had weakened protection of
worker safety. He charged the Democrats ``want a centralized
government. But we believe in the market; we believe in the
people.''
   Bentsen said some business owners ``put their profits before
people. And that's why you have to have OSHA.'' He said the
Democrats would do a better job of safeguarding workers.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FARM</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bentsen said the answer to farmers' problems is to push harder
to open up markets abroad for American products ``and stand up for
the American farmer.'' Quayle warned of ``another Jimmy Carter
grain embargo'' if the Democrats regain the White House.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bentsen charged that the Reagan administration doubled the
national debt in less than eight years. ``If you let me write $200
billion worth of hot checks every year, I could give you an
illusion of prosperity, too,'' he said.
   Quayle said the Republicans elped create 17 million new jobs and
rebuilt respect for America in the world.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bentsen said the Democrats would look for savings on farm
subsidies, on military purchases and by scrapping development of a
supersonic passenger jet. Quayle said Bentsen voted against the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. He said the president needs
more tools to fight the deficit, including line-item veto authority.

<TEXT>
   The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices fell sharply on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 133.30 yen, down 0.18 yen from Wednesday's
close of 133.48 yen. Opening at 133.37 yen, the currency moved in a
range of 133.30-133.53 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 95.53-point
loser the previous day, lost another 233.15 points, or 0.85
percent, to close at 27,172.34 points.
   ``Share prices fell mainly because the market will have a
three-day holiday this weekend, in addition to investors'
cautiousness before the release of the U.S. unemployment figures,''
said Manji Ueda with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   The U.S. monthly unemployment rate for September is due to be
released Friday in Washington.
   The market's fall in recent sessions has been contradicting
almost ideal economic factors surrounding the Tokyo market, Ueda
said, suggesting that the condition of Japan's ailing emperor has
been a market-affecting factor.
   In foreign exchange, trading was quiet before the U.S.
unemployment report, said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa with the Daiwa Bank.
   ``The dollar-yen rate was moving very little as investors traded
the currencies only for speculative reasons and position
adjustment,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Beverly Hills took cover, but fog grounded
the state's aerial insecticide attack on the Mediterranean fruit
fly in the ritzy neighborhood and other areas where the
crop-destroying pest has invaded.
   The postponement gave about 100,000 residents another day to
protect their Porsches, Rolls Royces and expensive outdoor statuary
against thousands of gallons of sticky mixture containing Malathion.
   The mission was rescheduled for 7 tonight.
   Some residents still doubted whether there has been sufficient
notice, but one Mercedes Benz dealer evacuated his high-priced
rolling stock into an underground parking garage and other car
dealers looked for tarps.
   ``I'm surprised with the way they notified us,'' said resident
Kevin Riley. ``The way they notified us has been so low-key that I
question whether there has been adequate notification.''
   Three helicopters scheduled to spray over a 35-square-mile area
of homes and businesses west of downtown late Wednesday stayed at
Santa Monica Airport after the fog rolled in from the ocean,
officials said.
   ``It was just too dangerous to try it,'' said Robert Donley at
the state's Medfly Hotline. ``They want to try it earlier. The
earlier they spray the better the chances they avoid the fog.''
   The spraying was ordered because 40 Medflies were found in yards
since Sept. 26, signaling a serious infestation that, if allowed to
spread, could threaten California's $8 billion in crops.
   The Medfly, a native to Central America, Hawaii and other
tropical areas, is believed to be brought to California unwittingly
by tourists or on illegally transported fruit mailed from Hawaii.
   If the all-night, eight-hour spraying assault wipes out enough
Medflies, officials will release sterile flies to breed with the
surviving insects to render them sterile, Donley said.
   Most of the exclusive residential sections of Beverly Hills,
including the mansions of Hollywood's rich and famous, are spared
of the spraying, but posh Rodeo Drive shops and many car
dealerships are in the target area.
   The pesticide poses no health risks, officials say, but the
sticky corn syrup bait mixed with the Malathion could mess up a
car's paint job. Museums in the area covered their outdoor statues.
   Ron Ferraro, who runs Scandinavian Auto Body in Beverly Hills,
scrambled to find tarpaulins or garage space Wednesday for a fleet
of Alfa Romeos.
   ``You're looking at about $7,500 in refinishing that would have
to be done,'' Ferraro said.
   But Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy said the fight to save
the state's farm industry knows no economic boundaries.
   ``We're encouraging people to cover up their Rolls Royces just
like they would cover up their Pintos,'' he said.
   Along with parts of Beverly Hills, officials are spraying the
Los Angeles sections of Culver City, Palms, Baldwin Hills and West
Hollywood.
   These communities all are dozens of miles from the nearest
commercial crops, but the pest can spread rapidly. It lays its eggs
under the skin of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, hatching
maggots that destroy the crop.
   The last serious infestation, in 1980 and 1981, cost California
farmers an estimated $100 million.

   Congress is in Washington, but a big chunk of
the Senate assembled in Omaha as Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen's
colleagues came to give reporters instant analyses of their vice
presidential debate. They said of the rivals things a senator
normally never says about a senator.
   Things like: ``cheap shot,'' ``knockout blow,'' ``vicious'' and
``unbecoming.'' One senator said he was ``embarrassed'' for another.
   Protocol took a powder. It's not the way they talk back in the
Capitol.
   More than two dozen lawmakers from both parties were flown in
for the showdown on ``Spin Alley,'' the area of the press hall
where campaign officials circulated to share with reporters their
views of the debates in hopes of influencing what got said on the
air or put in print.
   Each team had rented a charter to jet their players from
Washington into Omaha for the night and they sent in so many that
the spinners nearly crushed the press trying to write down their
reactions.
   Most of them flowed in two streams, one from each party, that
quickly filled the hall minutes after the contest ended. Bush's
campaign chairman, James A. Baker III, rated a briefing all his own
outside the debate hall.
   Before the debate, the two campaigns briefed the surrogates.
Afterward, verdicts in hand, the responses were predictable, and
they didn't always fit the decorum they practice in the Capitol.
   For the Democrats, the big topic was Bentsen's assertion to
Quayle that he was ``no Jack Kennedy.''
   ``I thought that was the knockout blow of the evening,'' said
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   ``I think he (Quayle) invited it, and it was a devastating
reply. When someone seeks to compare himself with someone, I think
it is very appropriate to say it like it is,'' said Sen. Bennett
Johnston, D-La.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., who had sought the presidency and was
a top choice for the vice presidency slot, said he was
``embarrassed'' for Quayle.
   ``I thought that he would do well. I thought this was the chance
to rehabilitate himself. All he had to do was to come in and look
halfway decent and avoid serious mistakes,'' he said.
   The Republicans called the Kennedy exchange a ``cheap shot'' and
insisted their Senate colleague put to rest any doubts that he was
qualified to be president.
   ``That is going to get sorted out in this whole game as a
vicious little spot,'' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo. ``I think it was a
cheap shot. That was very unbecoming of Lloyd Bentsen.''
   ``The expectation that Dan Quayle was going to come across this
evening as vastly inferior to Lloyd Bentsen was totally a myth,''
said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M. ``He came out quite to the
contrary a very competent person, given the most difficult
questions that anyone has ever been given.''
   Bentsen's Kennedy comment was ``vicious'' and Quayle's fault was
not being vicious enough in response, he said. Quayle should have
said in the rebuttal, ``Neither is Michael Dukakis,'' Domenici said.
   In what could be seen as perhaps the ultimate counter-spin to
the testy atmosphere, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and Rep. Dennis
Eckart, D-Ohio _ Quayle's Bentsen and Bentsen's Quayle in
mock-debate preparations _ stood and posed for pictures in the
press hall as the crowd finally started to thin out near midnight.
   In addition to the officials' ``spinning,'' each campaign
released a list of what were claimed to be distortions and
mis-statements by the opposition. The Republicans won that battle _
their list was out a good hour before the Democrats responded.
   Some of the spinners didn't wait until after the debate to offer
their views, a practice one wag called ``forespin.'' And the
reaction was always in line with the party line.
   ``I think Dan Quayle is more of an issue now than he was 90
minutes ago,'' said Susan Estrich, campaign manager for the Dukakis
campaign. That was about an hour before the debate even started,
but she said it again after the debate too.

<HEAD>FAA Reduces Number Of Landings At O'Hare After Controller Errors
Mount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Planes to and from Chicago are being delayed
safely on the ground in an unprecedented attempt to reduce
congestion and the growing number of air traffic controller errors
at the nation's busiest airport, officials say.
   The Federal Aviation Administration's move comes after
controllers at O'Hare International Airport made four mistakes in
less than a week.
   In those incidents, planes were allowed to get too close to each
other, officials said. None resulted in accidents.
   So far this year, controllers at O'Hare have made 30 mistakes,
compared with 12 in all of 1987, the FAA said.
   ``I can't explain the reason,'' said Don Zochert, an FAA
spokesman. ``That's the question everybody wants the answer to, and
if there was an easy solution we'd have it.''
   Under the plan, which was announced Wednesday but had taken
effect earlier this week, flights to Chicago will be delayed on the
ground in their cities of origin rather than in the air over O'Hare
and the smaller Midway Airport here when there is too much traffic,
said FAA spokeswoman Barbara Dettmer.
   During peak periods _ usually between 4:45 p.m. and 9:15 p.m.
CDT daily _ the maximum number of planes allowed to depart and land
in good weather will be reduced to about 155 per hour from 180, Ms.
Dettmer said. The number is curtailed further during poor weather.
   The plan also will affect some flights at Midway because the
airports share air space.
   The policy resulted in a total of up to 243 delays at O'Hare on
Monday and Tuesday, and up to 33 delays at Midway on Tuesday,
according to reports published today. The weather was good on both
days. The FAA defines a delay as a flight landing at least 15
minutes later than its scheduled arrival time.
   ``This is a new program,'' said Ted Burcham, manager of the
FAA's Great Lakes Region Air Traffic Division. ``We could be
accused of being a bit overcautious if the approach we've taken is
too severe. But it's preliminary and we're going to adjust it as we
use the program and see what it does for us.''
   Asked if the controller errors worry the FAA, Burcham replied:
``Tremendously. I am losing sleep over it.''
   Controllers at O'Hare, the nation's busiest airport, made two
errors Friday, one Sunday and one Tuesday, Zochert said.
   In comparison, Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport _ the
nation's second busiest _ has had six errors this year, and
Washington's National Airport just two, officials said.
   The latest incidents here came just two months after the
National Transportation Safety Board issued a report saying that
chronic understaffing of controllers, mandatory overtime, outdated
equipment and inadequate training contributed to mistakes at O'Hare.
   In Tuesday's incident, a United Airlines jet and a smaller
Simmons Airlines plane came within 500 feet of each other 13 miles
east of O'Hare, Zochert said.
   On Sunday, two United jets came within 500 feet of each other
after the pilot of one plane apparently followed an order intended
for the other.
   On Friday, two Air Wisconsin jets came near each other when a
controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an order to
descend from 14,000 feet to 11,000, the FAA said.
   Also Friday, an American Airlines jet and a Delta Air Lines jet
came within 400 feet vertically and a mile horizontally when the
pilot of the American plane apparently failed to repeat an order to

<HEAD>DOE Says New Safety Guidelines For Reactor Got Lost In Paperwork</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs after 12th graf pvs, `A technical..., with
DOE report in The State newspaper; picks up 13th graf pvs, `As

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says new safety guidelines for
the Savannah River Plant that makes radioactive material for
nuclear arms were lost in ``paper work'' for a month last summer.
   During the delay, the plant operator waited 40 hours before
notifying the Department of Energy of a small power surge that
caused the shutdown of one of three atomic reactors at the plant,
Becky Craft, a department spokeswoman, said Wednesday.
   The delay violated both the new and the previous guidelines, she
said, and efforts have been made to improve procedures.
   Savannah River is the only U.S. facility which produces
weapons-grade plutonium and tritium.
   DOE and the E.I. du Pont Nemours & Co., which operates the plant
under contract, have come under fire in recent days because of
disclosures that during a 28-year period, up to 30 significant
reactor mishaps there were not reported to the public and in some
cases to Washington.
   The power surge in August triggered a review by an internal
Energy Department team which found the P reactor involved suffers
from ``numerous and longstanding'' problems with its control rods _
which act as accelerators and brakes on a reactor's rate of fission
_ that may prevent operators from recognizing potentially dangerous
conditions in its core, The Washington Post reported today.
   ``Technical support personnel stated they routinely calculate
core reactivity assuming seven rods are not in their programmed
positions,'' the team's report said, according to The Post. The
newspaper said it obtained a copy of the study, which has not been
released publicly.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that a study by
a consulting firm of the plant's operations from 1971-1987 shows
that chronic equipment failure and poor operating procedures caused
nuclear reactors there to shut down unexpectedly nine to 12 times a
year for nearly two decades.
   That rate is twice that of the civilian nuclear power industry,
and Richard W. Starostecki, DOE's chief safety operator, told the
newspaper that civilian reactors with the same number of forced
shutdowns would have had their operating licenses revoked.
   Meanwhile, an internal memorandum about a May 10, 1965 accident
at the Savannah River plant said a supervisor had to stop a foreman
from taking action that could have turned a leak of cooling water
into a catastrophic accident, The Times reported from Aiken, S.C.,
near where the plant is located.
   ``One trained man stood between us and disaster,'' said the memo
written by a Du Pont engineer, Frederick B. Christensen, in 1981
when he took early retirement. Christensen had been in the reactor
control room when the incident occurred.
   A technical supervisor at the plant, Gerald F. Merz, told The
Times in an interview Wednesday that this was ``a premature
conclusion.''
   The Department of Energy, in an internal report obtained by the
The State of Columbia, S.C., criticized Savannah River's management
as isolated and said the plant is operated counter to ``practices
common to well-run nuclear plants.''
   The 50-page draft memorandum criticized ``less than precise and
out-of-date operating practices'' throughout the plant's management
and reactor staff, the newspaper reported today.
   Written by a panel of DOE officials and represenatives from
companies working at the plant, the report criticized Du Pont and
DOE for allowing reactor operators to grow complacent. It called
for streamlined communications and better training to handle
emergencies.
   As part of an effort to improve safety and reporting procedures
at Savannah River, Energy Undersecretary Joseph Salgado issued a
new order on June 21 requiring the contractor and the regional
Energy Department office, in Aiken to notify the Washington
headquarters immediately in the event of a safety problem.
   The notice did not reach the mailroom of the regional office
until July 7, nearly three weeks after it was issued. And it took
another month to reach the appropriate office in Aiken, said Ms.
Craft. The regional department office asked for clarification from
Washington and did not send the new guidance to Du Pont until Aug.
23, she said.
   In the meantime there was another mishap, a small power pulse on
Aug. 7 which caused the reactor to be shut down on Aug. 9.
   Since the incident in August, said Ms. Craft, ``we have worked
with du Pont to correct any deficiencies that we had. There are
several programs that du Pont has put in place to prevent this from
occurring in the future,'' she said.
   Du Pont spokesmen did not immediately return telephone calls to
their offices in Aiken.

<HEAD>Police Break Up Student Protest At Parliamentary Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot police arrested a band of radical
students today after they stormed into the office of a governing
party lawmaker with iron pipes and firebombs and shouted anti-U.S.
and anti-government slogans.
   Students broke windows and unfolded a giant placard that read
``Drive out Yankees'' and ``Arrest (former president) Chun
Doo-hwan.'' Students threatened to burn the office or jump from
windows if police intervened.
   Police were backed up by firetrucks and hundreds more police who
spread sponge matresses around the building to prevent suicide
attempts.
   Police said 23 students from seven universities in Seoul
overpowered security guards, charged into Parliamentary Hall, a
legislative office building, through the main gate and locked
themslves inside the office.
   The students had invaded the office of Chung Ho-yong, a senior
member of the governing Democratic Justice Party. Chung was not in
the office.
   At least one student was seriously injured when he cut his
stomach with a razor, witnesses said. One of Chung's aides and
several policemen were also hurt in the attack, the South Korean
news agency Yonhap said.
   The two-hour protest in the fourth-floor office near the
National Assembly building ended when about 100 riot police
specializing in martial arts broke through the office door.
   The students shouting anti-U.S and anti-government slogans
demanded immediate punishment of former president Chun who has been
under parliamentary investigations for alleged corruption and
brutality since he left office in February.
   Dissidents charge that Chung, a former army general and Army
Academy classmate of President Roh Tae-woo, played a role in
supressing the 1980 civil uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.
Nearly 200 people were killed in the uprising.

   The Duke and Duchess of York spent an
unscheduled morning on the Brisbane River today when their
hovercraft broke down enroute to the St. Helena convict settlement
at Moreton Bay.
   The couple was stranded and missed their appointment when the
Mirage craft lost power in one engine near Pinkenba, about 3 miles
from the river mouth.
   British media representatives which had gathered for the photo
opportunity fumed while the royal pair licked ice cream in a police
car 10 miles away.
   Later Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, stunned shop assistant
Frances Jones when he walked into the Pinkenba Bait And Tackle
store, to pay for the ice cream.
   ``I was stunned. I looked up and there was the duke walking in.
And Fergie came in just behind. I knew who they were straight away
from all the photographs,'' said Ms. Frances, 22.
   ``I was a bit flustered. You don't get a duke in here every day.
But I managed to work out the right change ... Andrew picked it up
and put the money in his pocket.''
   Shop owner Mark Heyer was away at the time. But he said later,
``I'm going to get two feet painted on the floor and put up a sign
saying Fergie stood here.'''
   The visit was not on the official schedule.
   Later today, the royal couple braved sweltering heat for a
``meet the people walk'' and lunch at Brisbane City Hall.
Afterward, they went on a tour of the Expo '88 site, which closes
at the end of this month.
   The couple is visiting Australia for the bicentennial
celebrations and is scheduled to depart Friday.

   The dollar dipped slightly against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices fell sharply on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 95.53 points
Wednesday, lost another 233.15 points, or 0.85 percent, to finish
trading at 27,172.34. The index fell for the fifth straight day for
the first time this year.
   An analyst at Nomura Securities said the market's poor
performance stemmed from uncertainty before the release of U.S.
unemployment figures for September, scheduled for Friday.
   ``And of course, another major reason is the condition of the
emperor, although very few people mention it directly,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Emperor Hirohito, 87, has been in serious condition since he
vomited blood Sept. 19.
   Trading was light, with volume on the first section estimated at
600 million shares, and only a few issues such as paper and pulp
attracted attention.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 133.30 yen, down 0.18 yen from
Wednesday's close of 133.48 yen. Opening slightly higher at 133.37
yen, the currency ranged between 133.30 and 133.53 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen rate was moving very little as investors traded
the currencies only for their speculative reasons and position
adjustment,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of the Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.
   Other dealers said the market lacked incentives and dealers were
cautious while awaiting the U.S. unemployment report.

<TEXT>
   After lurching through bloodshed and
political upheaval, Burma is almost back to where it was 11 weeks
ago: with an authoritarian government and few prospects for the
democracy that once seemed so close.
   Since the resignation of strongman Ne Win on July 23, several
thousand people have died, hundreds of thousands marched in the
streets in a nationwide uprising and three leaders took turns at
the helm.
   Now, some Western experts say the best hope for the
pro-democracy forces is that the government will offer political
and economic liberalization to appease an angry population.
Pressure for change, they say, may also come from Burma's vital
foreign aid donors.
   ``Given all that's happened, it's silly to write the opposition
off, but overall I think the army is sitting squarely on top of the
people for at least the next few weeks,'' said a Western diplomat
in Bangkok.
   The recent chaotic events amounted to the largest
anti-government movement in the past 26 years of autocratic rule
and the most intense and widespread display of ``people power''
since the Burmese fight for independence from Great Britain.
   But the ruling oligarchy of military men around Ne Win, despite
earlier rumors that they were about to flee the country, dug in,
maneuvered with what some analysts say was ``Machiavellian
brilliance'' and at the very least temporarily won the day.
   As the drama unfolded, Burma experts offered a number of
possible scenarios, including one that called for the military to
shoot as many protestors as necessary to retain power.
   This is the option it chose, together with what one Western
ambassador in Rangoon described as a ``devilish plot'' of stoking
chaos and anxiety among masses who grew increasingly short of food,
fuel and other necessities.
   ``The people have been beaten over the head for two months. They
never got weapons and they were never really organized _ and the
army never cracked,'' said American Burma scholar Josef Silverstein.
   Although the government has promised general elections, a key
opposition leader, former defense minister Tin Oo, told The
Associated Press: ``All the opposition leaders are now facing
arrest and other punitive measures. So what can I say? The
situation is so undemocratic.''
   Opponents appear to have little maneuvering room. Their major
weapon, a general strike that began Aug. 8, was blunted when civil
servants and factory workers threatened by dismissal returned to
their jobs Oct. 3.
   Rather than a single, united opposition, at least four
anti-government parties have emerged while the more radical
students, who spearheaded the demonstrations, are fleeing to the
Thai-Burmese border to get guerrilla training from ethnic minority
rebels.
   By contrast, the conservative party has the benefit of big
coffers, a nationwide network built up over 26 years and a body of
loyalists who stand to lose sizable perks should the opposition
win. Despite efforts to officially divorce the National Unity Party
from the government, analysts agree it is a major instrument of the
military-backed leadership.
   Prior to the current upheavals the party, then known as the
Burma Program Socialist Party, claimed that more than 14 million
out of Burma's 38 million people were members of either the party
or its affiliates.
   Silverstein and others say the leadership's weak spot is the
shattered economy and dependence on foreign aid to mount a revival.
   Japan, which supplies about 80 percent of foreign loans and
grants, and other donors have frozen assistance but whether Tokyo
choses to use its considerable clout to shape events inside Burma
remains uncertain.
   ``This is a lever the military has to cope with. If anything can
now leverage the situation it's going to be the need for outside
assistance,'' Silverstein said.

<HEAD>Judge Seals Klan Verdict After Plaintiff Seeks to Drop Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has sealed a jury's verdict in a
$1.5 million damage suit against the Ku Klux Klan while he
considers a city council member's decision to withdraw as the chief
plaintiff.
   In a rambling explanation to U.S. District Judge Charles A. Moye
Jr., longtime civil rights activist and City Councilman Hosea L.
Williams said Wednesday he had lost sleep worrying about the
blue-collar defendants ``who have nothing but their homes, their
cars and their paychecks. ... I could not disrupt their families.''
   The suit seeks $1 million in punitive damages against two KKK
groups as corporations. Alabama lawyer Morris Dees also asked the
jury to return heavy individual damages: $200,000 against David
Holland, grand dragon of the Southern White Knights; and $100,000
each against Daniel Carver, Georgia grand dragon of the Invisible
Empire; the group's former grand dragon, Edward Stephens; and
Marion Franklin Shirley, a veteran of several white supremacist
groups and an associate of Holland's.
   But state Rep. Billy McKinney, D-Atlanta, who joined the lawsuit
in July, objected to Williams' attempt to halt the trial, resulting
in a hectic day of legal maneuvering while jurors were deliberating
a verdict.
   The suit charged that leaders of the Klan groups conspired to
disrupt a Jan. 17, 1987, ``brotherhood march'' by civil rights
activists in Forsyth County and violate the marchers' civil rights.
   Participants in the march were pelted with rocks, bottles and
other debris thrown from people who were among a large group of
counterdemonstrators who gathered in the virtually all-white county
north of Atlanta.
   A week later, more than 20,000 people descended upon Forsyth
County in a huge civil rights march that drew national attention.
   Moye ordered that the verdict, delivered to the courtroom
shortly before 5 p.m., be sealed in an envelope. He dismissed the
six jurors with orders that they not discuss their verdict with
anyone. He did not tell them why their verdict was sealed.
   Moye ordered a hearing today with Dees, who brought the lawsuit
on behalf of Williams, McKinney and 55 other marchers pelted with
rocks and bottles; and attorneys for the two KKK organizations,
their leaders and other defendants.
   Moye did not discuss the subject of the hearing, but defense
attorneys told the court they will file motions to reopen the trial
in order to question Williams and McKinney.
   The jury, which included one black member, began its
deliberations at Wednesday morning.
   Williams said he was torn by conscience as a believer in
``redemption'' and ``forgiving your enemies,'' saying Jesus Christ
and the late Martin Luther King Jr. would approve.
   Defense attorney Sam Dickson said it was a ``noble, chivalrous
and Christian gesture.''

<HEAD>President Says Industrialized Countries Beginning to Understand
Debt Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Miguel de la Madrid says there are
``slight and tenuous signs'' that the industrialized countries are
beginning to understand the problem of the debt owed them by
developing nations.
   The question is whether that understanding will lead to
solutions to the problem, the outgoing president said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   De la Madrid also said that Mexico will respond to the stronger
showing by opposition parties in July 6 general elections and
become a ``more democratic country.''
   De la Madrid, 54, leaves office Dec. 1. His Institutional
Revolutionary Party has governed Mexico since 1929 and will
continue to do so under president-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   De la Madrid has been a leader in demanding better debt payment
conditions for the Third World but at the same time has maintained
Mexico's commitment to pay.
   Mexico has renegotiated its debt and made service payments of
more than $75 billion in the past six years that de la Madrid has
been president. But the principal is $104 billion, a few billion
more than when de la Madrid took office.
   Pointing to Mexico as an example, de la Madrid said debtor
nations must ``set our house in order internally'' with economic
measures and ``demand at the same time a fair and realistic deal
from creditors.''
   He said some world leaders and banks now realize that the debt
affects the entire world economy.
   ``Mexico insists on joint responsibility of debtor and creditor
for the debt,'' he said.
   He said the Institutional Revolutionary Party must ``modernize
while retaining its principles but become more efficient'' in
working with the grass-roots membership.
   However, the opposition leftist and rightist parties also ``must
realize the times they live in and update their ideology, change
tactics and present articulate programs to the people,'' he said.
   He said the ``relative strengthening of the opposition is a
small price to pay for the strengthening of political pluralism.''
   Political reforms de la Madrid initiated led to greater
opposition representation in Congress.
   Relaxed and smiling easily during the interview, de la Madrid
recalled that when he took office the country had just $100 million
in reserves. Citizens were disenchanted with a political system,
which though stable, was fraught with corruption.
   The world oil price collapse had shattered Mexican dreams of
abundance of citizens told two years earlier that they were on
their way to prosperity.
   There is general agreement that the stocky, unpretentious
president who dealt out strong economic medicine held together a
country on the verge of social conflict six years ago.
   ``The most serious problem at the time was the lack of
confidence of Mexicans in themselves and the conflict between
social groups. My concern was to maintain peace and individual
freedoms while trying to obtain a social consensus,'' he said.
   De la Madrid enacted measures that eliminated many subsidies.
Prices went up and salaries lost more than half their buying power.
He was accused of favoring the elite.
   Through the PRI dominance of labor unions, he kept protests down
and eventually got labor, government and private business to agree
on a wage and price control plan that reduced inflation to an
estimated 50 percent for this year, down from 159.2 percent in 1987.
   De la Madrid brought Mexico into the General Agreement on Trade
and Tariffs, opening Mexico's markets and forcing its manufacturers
to compete.
   The manufacturing industry's exports in 1972 paid for only 26
percent of its imports. In 1987, they paid for 98 percent of the
imports.
   International dollar reserves climbed to $15 billion this year
as non-oil exports made up for the large drop in petroleum income.
   ``I am satisfied that some progress was made,'' de la Madrid
said. But he acknowledged things will not be easy for Salinas de
Gortari.

   Utility workers stayed off their jobs
today, cutting off electricity and lowering water supplies to much
of the nation.
   Employees of the national power authority went on strike
Wednesday night demanding higher pay. Labor Minister Abubakar Umar
said he had referred the demands to the country's Industrial Court
for arbitration.
   In Lagos, the water authority said it could not run its engines
indefinitely on its emergency power system.
   The workers were demanding that the military government review
both their salaries and fringe benefits as part of its plan to run
the electricity authority on a commercial basis. In the past the
authority has charged rates well below cost and failed to collect a
large share of accounts.
   Many businesses and government agencies were able to operate at
least marginally using emergency power systems set up to deal with
frequent power failures.
   Nigeria, with 100 million people, is Africa's most populous

<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker says he's digging
in for a long battle to reclaim the television ministry and that
he's not deterred by a Canadian businessman who has signed a
contract to buy PTL's assets.
   Bakker, whose own proposal to buy back the television ministry
fell through, said many obstacles remain for Stephen Mernick of
Toronto, who wants to purchase the ministry's assets for $115
million.
   ``I look towards the long haul, I'm not in this for a short
term. Maybe it'll be another year before we restore (PTL), maybe it
will be two years,'' said Bakker, who left in March 1987 amid a
sex-and-money scandal.
   PTL's court-appointed trustee, M.C. ``Red'' Benton, announced
Tuesday he had signed a contract with Mernick. Benton had
identified other potential buyers but had not previously gone to
the contract stage.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy reorganization since June 1987 and
must sell its assets to pay creditors as soon as possible under an
order from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds. Reynolds must
approve any sale, and is expected to hold a hearing in about a
month on Mernick's bid.
   ``There are so many obstacles that no way could I even think
about all of the ramifications of all this until I hear the final
gavel of the judge,'' Bakker said Wednesday.
   ``It's not over till it's over, as I've been saying,'' he said
in front of the new Jim and Tammy Information Office about two
miles south of the Christian theme park, Heritage USA. ``It seems
every few weeks we go through it's been sold again, and sold
again,'' he said, referring to other deals that collapsed.
   Attorney Joseph Kluttz, representing Mernick, said Mernick will
pay $50 million at closing for the deal and pay the $65 million
balance over five years.
   Mernick, an Orthodox Jew, has not said what he plans to do with
PTL or Heritage USA but that he would consider retaining its
Christian theme.
   Benton has said other bidders may still present offers directly
to the bankruptcy court, but he said his recommendation gives
Mernick's offer a strong upper hand.
   Bakker had proposed a $172 million plan to buy the ministry's
assets, but his bid lost credibility last month when he could not
come up with a $3 million downpayment.
   Bakker said he was skeptical about Mernick's chances of making
PTL profitable again.
   ``There's a thousand-room hotel there; I don't know how they're
going to fill it, I don't know how anyone without national
telelvison experience could fill it,'' he said.

come,'' said Bob Burford, director of the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management, which sponsored the sanctuary and its dedication
Wednesday.
   The horses joined about 150 others already running free on the
sanctuary in an isolated southern Black Hills canyon.
   The mustangs were rounded up by the federal government from
public lands across the southwestern United States. The wild horses
in some areas were in danger of starving to death because natural
food sources no longer existed.
   The horses also were a nuisance to private landowners. Some have
been found slaughtered in Nevada.
   Nevada Gov. Dick Bryan earlier this week pledged full state
support to help federal officials in their investigation of the
rifle killings of nearly 300 wild horses.
   All the shootings occurred in remote central Nevada within a
40-mile stretch north of Austin, an isolated Nevada town on U.S.
50. Federal investigators said the horses died over a six-month
period.
   But at the sanctuary in South Dakota, state officials said they
think the wild horses will be a popular tourist attraction,
particularly during the state's centennial next year when attention
is focused on South Dakota's frontier and western heritage.
   The driving force behind the sanctuary was Dayton Hyde, a
lifelong rancher and the founder of the Institute of Range and the
American Mustang.
   ``They're having fun,'' Hyde said. ``They spend a lot of their
time just running. They take off like school children.''
   Hyde said he hopes to develop a wild horse museum at the
sanctuary, featuring films about horses and a history of the horse
in the West's development.
   ``I want a front porch from which you can see the horse herd
along the Cheyenne River,'' he said. ``This is some of the most
beautiful country in the West. Not enough people get to see it.''

<HEAD>Moslem Insurgents Claim Control Of Third Provincial Capital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels said today they
captured a third provincial capital and seized a city along the
strategic Kabul-Jalalabad highway that includes a major
hydroelectric plant.
   Spokesmen from Afghan resistance parties headquartered in
Pakistan said guerrillas made significant gains against the Marxist
government this week, particularly in eastern Afghanistan.
   A Western diplomat confirmed the fall of Sharan, capital of
Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan. Three of the 29 provincial
capitals now are reportedly under guerrilla control.
   ``Its only significance is that it's a provincial capital,
nothing else,'' said Azim Nasir-Zia of the National Islamic Front
of Afghanistan resistance organization.
   The guerrilla-controlled Afghan News Agency said government
troops at Sharan were captured, but it gave no figures. Guerrillas
claim to control Toloqan, the northeastern provincial capital of
Takhar, and the central Bamyan provincial capital.
   Naser-Zia said Afghan guerrillas also took control of Sarobi, 36
miles east of the Afghan capital on the strategic Kabul-Jalalabad
highway. The city has a hydroelectric plant that feeds power to the
capital, Kabul, he said.
   In other fighting, Afghan rebels said the heavily fortified
military town of Urgun in Paktika province was captured.
   Jan Mohammed of the Hezb-e-Islami group's Khalis faction said
the garrison town was overrun during a joint operation Wednesday
involving guerrillas from the seven resistance parties,
headquartered in Peshawar.
   A field commander with the Itihad-e-Islami resistance group said
the fall of Urgun gives the guerrillas full control of Pakitika
province.
   ``Urgun is considered the most strategic district in Paktika,''
said a guerrilla spokesman. ``It is very important, as control of
Urgun allows control of the most strategic roads to north and
central Afghanistan.''
   The U.S.-supported Afghan guerrillas have been fighting the
Soviet-backed Kabul government for the past 10 years. Soviet
soldiers, who entered Afghanistan to prop up the embattled
Communist government in December 1979, began leaving in May.
   A United Nations agreement signed in Geneva provides for the
complete withdrawal of about 100,000 Red Army troops by Feb. 15.

   Arab gunmen today fatally shot two West Bank
Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, including a
village elder gunned down while driving with his children, radio
reports and Arab witnesses said.
   Also today, the Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas called for an
end to Palestinian infighting, indicating that it has healed its
rift with the PLO-backed Unified National Leadership of the
Uprising.
   ``We must be united despite the differences in our beliefs,''
Hamas said in an underground leaflet distributed in the occupied
lands. ``We are ... against any kind of split.''
   The rapprochement came after several meetings between the two
groups in the past two weeks, Arab sources said.
   Hamas repeatedly has challenged the leadership of pro-PLO groups
in orchestrating the uprising. Last month, Hamas staged a
successful general strike in defiance of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Two sons of the slain village leader, an 8-year-old and a
14-year-old, were wounded in the attack in Biddya in the occupied
West Bank, military sources and Israel radio said.
   The dead mukhtar, or traditional village leader, was ambushed by
gunmen while driving his car. He was identified as 46-year-old
Mustafa Salim Abu Bakr.
   Witnesses said the elder's body was set on fire with his car
after the attack.
   The army confirmed the death and clamped a curfew on Biddya, 45
miles north of Jerusalem. The radio said troops arrested several
Palestinian suspects.
   Military sources said there had been past attempts on Abu Bakr's
life, including a gun attack in August.
   The second Palestinian, 25-year-old Ahmed Sahour, was sprayed
with gunfire in a cafe in the Israeli Arab village of Umm El Fahm,
where he had been in hiding since being chased out of the nearby
West Bank village of Amin, the radio and Arab witnesses said.
   The radio said Sahour was struck by six pistol shots.
   The deaths raised to nine the number of suspected collaborators
killed since the Arab uprising began nearly 10 months ago.
Underground leaders have ordered Palestinians to attack all Arabs
cooperating with Israel.
   In all, 283 Palestinians have been killed since Dec. 8, the
beginning of the rebellion against Israel's 21-year occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Six Israelis have also been killed.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded two
Palestinians during clashes in the Jebaliya refugee camp and Gaza
City, officials at the city's Ahli Arab Hospital said.
   The army clamped curfews on Jebaliya as well as the Gaza refugee
camps of Shati and Bureij.
   The clashes came during a general strike observed throughout the
coastal Gaza Strip in memory of four Palestinian guerrillas killed
a year ago in a shootout with Israeli soldiers.
   The four, members of the Moslem fundamentalist group Islamic
Jihad, were shot to death Oct. 6, 1987 when they refused to stop at
an army roadblock in Gaza City.
   On Wednesday, two Israel troops were injured when a firebomb
smashed into their jeep in the West Bank town of Tulkarem. One
soldier suffered moderate to serious burns and the other was
slightly injured.
   Troops shot and wounded 14 Palestinians in clashes Wednesday and
a 23-year-old Palestinian from the Balata refugee camp died of
wounds he suffered a week earlier.

   A woman who listened on the telephone as her
boyfriend was shot to death provided authorities with the name of a
suspect who was charged in the shooting, police said.
   Harold Tinch, 30, a security guard, was shot in the neck,
abdomen and right hand while talking on the telephone Tuesday night
with his girlfriend, Sarah Gordon, 25, of Detroit.
   Alarmed after hearing three shots and then silence on the
Chicago end of the line, Ms. Gordon hung up and dialed the Chicago
Police Department to report what she heard.
   Ms. Gordon's information led to the arrest Wednesday of Ricardo
Manuel, 29, who was charged with first degree murder.
   While Tinch and Ms. Gordon were talking, Ms. Gordon heard a man
enter Tinch's home. She asked who it was, and Tinch responded
``Rick,'' Ms. Gordon told police.
   As the couple continued to talk, Ms. Gordon heard Tinch tell
Rick to ``put the gun down and stop playing with it.'' Tinch owned
a .38-caliber revolver.
   Shortly thereafter, Ms. Gordon said she heard Tinch again ask
Rick to ``put it down. Don't point it at me.''
   She then heard a shot and heard Tinch say, ``Don't shoot me
again.'' Ms. Gordon heard two more shots, then silence.
   Police found Tinch dead in an upstairs bedroom. Police said they
found the revolver, with three expended cartridges, in the room.
   Neighbors directed police to Manuel, who lived a block away.
   Manuel admitted that he shot Tinch, saying it was accidental,
police said.

<TEXT>
   The heated vice presidential debate exchange over Dan Quayle's
invocation of John F. Kennedy is drawing strong partisan reaction,
with Democrats denouncing the ``audacity'' of the Indiana senator
and backers of the Republican ticket accusing Lloyd Bentsen of ``a
cheap shot.''
   Politicians followed party lines in their reaction to Wednesday
night's confrontation between the hand-picked candidates for vice
president.
   Backers of Democrat Michael Dukakis declared Bentsen a landslide
winner, while supporters of Republican George Bush were equally
effusive about Quayle's performance.
   Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York said today that Quayle
``looked like Johnny Carson playing Karnac; he started with the
answers and looked for the questions. So when you judge the top of
the ticket, judge them by the people they select.''
   On the other side, Republican Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire
said that both Quayle and Bentsen showed ``they can serve as
president if necessary'' but that the focus would now return to
Dukakis and Bush. ``As much as the Democrats are trying to suggest
that Michael Dukakis is not going to serve if elected, he is,''
Sununu said.
   Both commented on NBC's ``Today.''
   Debate coaches gave the edge to Bentsen, with one calling the
Kennedy exchange the point that turned the clash in the Texan's
favor.
   Melissa Maxcy Wade, the director of forensics at Emory
University and a member of a panel of experts who judged the debate
for The Associated Press, said ``I thought Quayle really held his
own until we got to the John Kennedy question. It was like a father
putting down a child. I thought the momentum turned then.''
   The dramatic highlight of the 90-minute debate occurred at the
midpoint when Quayle said his qualifications for high office were
equal to those of Kennedy when he was elected president in 1960.
Like Kennedy, Quayle has served eight years in the Senate.
   ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy,'' Bentsen snapped.
   ``That was really uncalled for,'' Quayle retorted.
   Replied Bentsen: ``You're the one that was making the
comparison, senator ... and I did not think the comparison was well
taken.''
   ``Dan Quayle has the audacity to compare himself to John
Kennedy,'' said Buie Seawell, chairman of the Colorado Democratic
Party. ``You saw Lloyd Bentsen throw a right cross that dropped him
to the canvas.''
   ``I think it was a cheap shot,'' Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of
Wyoming said of the Bentsen jibe. ``That was very unbecoming of
Lloyd Bentsen.''
   Arne Carlson, Minnesota state auditor and the state's highest
ranking GOP official, praised both debaters.
   ``Bentsen is obviously mature, well informed,'' he said.
``Quayle came across as quite bright, alert. I think he did an
excellent job of dispelling concern people had over his candidacy.''
   Carlson said Bentsen ``made a terrible mistake with the jab on
John Kennedy. I think most people thought that was unnecessary and
quite rude.''
   ``It threw a chill over the whole debate, a sour note,'' said
Atlanta-based pollster Claibourne Darden. ``It changed from then
on, the way you looked at Lloyd Bentsen.''
   California pollster Mervyn Field also used the man-boy analogy,
to describe the Kennedy exchange.
   ``Bentsen came through as the man and Quayle came through as the
boy,'' he said.
   Geraldine Ferraro, whose family was subjected to intense
investigation after her Democratic vice presidential nomination
four years ago, laughingly disagreed with Quayle's contention that
he was the most-investigated candidate in history.
   ``He's young, but he's not that young; he's got to remember
1984,'' she said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Field said he thought Bentsen did so well people might wish he
were at the top of the Democratic ticket rather than Dukakis.
   ``It may be a mixed blessing to the Democratic ticket,'' he said.
   Darden took a similar view, saying, ``Bentsen makes Michael
Dukakis look weak.''
   Merle Black, a political scientist at the University of North
Carolina, said ``I think Bentsen did a better job. I think the
Dukakis ticket ought to be helped by his performance.''
   But he also praised Quayle who, he said, ``performed well enough
that the Bush campaign will not have to engage in extensive damage
control after tonight. But I think he was out-debated by Bentsen.''
   Nancy Neuman, president of the League of Women Voters, called
the debate a draw.
   ``I don't see that one outshone the other particularly,'' she
said. ``I think they came off pretty well as they intended. Whether
the voters won, I'm still trying to figure out.''

<HEAD>Woman Sues Ex-Husband For Filling Out Questionnaire In Her Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman has sued her ex-husband, claiming
he filled out her class reunion questionnaire with defamatory
information, including that one of her hobbies is ``looking for new
and wealthier husbands.''
   In a suit filed in Ramsey County District Court, Sharon K.
Silver alleges that her former husband, Gerald H. Pfeffer of
Willernie, received the high school class reunion questionnaire and
sent it back with false allegations.
   The responses were published in a reunion publication and seen
by 100 former classmates, according to the suit.
   Under the heading ``Achievements Most Proud Of,'' Pfeffer wrote,
according to the suit, ``My three divorces and how each time I
married into more money to the point where I am now living on the
$400,000 settlement and interest from my third divorce.''
   The suit also said Pfeffer wrote that his ex-wife's hobbies were
night clubbing, partying and looking for new and wealthier husbands.
   Under the heading ``Secret Ambition or Fantasy,'' the suit
claims Pfeffer wrote: ``Seeing if I can't get married as many times
as Liz Taylor and gain my riches through divorces instead of
working.''
   Pfeffer could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
   The reunion committee for Silver's class of 1958 sent out
questionnaires last spring asking for information to be included in
a publication for former classmates, the suit said.
   Silver, who now lives in West Virginia, claims the questionnaire
fell into Pfeffer's hands when it was mailed to her old address in
Willernie.
   She is seeking in excess of $50,000 in damages, claiming the
false allegations have caused her a loss of reputation.

   New Yorkers already accustomed to subway ads for
hemorrhoid ointments, roach killers and AIDS prevention will see a
graphic ad opposing aid to El Salvador that had been rejected here
and elsewhere as inflammatory.
   The advertisement shows a photograph of a dead man lying in a
pool of blood on a Salvadoran street. ``What are your tax dollars
buying in El Salvador?'' it asks.
   The company that controls subway ad contracts for the city had
rejected it last spring on the grounds that it was ``inflammatory''
and ``offensive.''
   The ad finally went up in every fourth subway car this week
after the organization behind it threatened legal action and the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority decided the ad did not
violate its standards of good taste.
   The ad is sponsored by Winning Democracy in El Salvador, a
Washington, D.C.-based coalition of organizations that opposes U.S.
aid to El Salvador.
   All told, producing and renting the space for the New York ad is
costing Winning Democracy about $20,000, said Mike D'Elia, a New
York spokesman for the group.
   The coalition is placing similar ads in buses and subways
throughout the country. In San Francisco, the ads are due in a
month or two. In Washington, they will be going up this week. They
are up already in Boston.
   The company that arranges ad contracts for Los Angeles' buses
has so far refused to accept the ads, said Carol Waymire, who
represents the Winning Democracy in El Salvador campaign in Los
Angeles.
   In New York, an April rejection letter from the private firm
that handles subway ad contracts for the MTA stated that the ad was
``inflammatory'' and could ``encourage vandalism'' by riders who
might be tempted to tear it down.
   In another letter, the New York Subways Advertising Firm cited a
provision in its contract with the city under which ads may be
rejected if they are ``deemed offensive to good taste.''
   ``But they have all sorts of offensive things advertised in the
subway _cockroach ads, ads about AIDS, about abortion, about
incest,'' D'Elia said.
   ``We think that's great that they put these other signs up. But
we were totally befuddled that we couldn't put our signs up.''
   At no cost to Winning Democracy, Edward Copeland, a lawyer who
specializes in civil liberties, agreed to challenge the rejection
of the ad as a violation of the constitutional right to freedom of
expression.
   ``The First Amendment applies to public forums, and the subways
in New York are public forums,'' he said. ``The Winning Democracy
people have a right to express their viewpoints and to reach out to
their fellow citizens.''
   The conflict was resolved without a lawsuit after Copeland
contacted the MTA.
   ``When we reviewed it, we didn't find it to be objectionable,''
said MTA spokesman Tito Davila. ``We have the final say on these
things.''
   Davila said the subway ad firm is supposed to submit any
rejected advertisement to the MTA for final review, but failed to
do so in this case.
   Bill Apfelbaum, president of the firm, did not return phone
calls by The Associated Press seeking comment.
   As compensation for the delay in accepting the ad, it will run
for two months for the price of one, Copeland said.
   ``We're hoping the ad will get the public debating again about
what's happening in El Salvador,'' said D'Elia. ``We're trying to
expose the policy of U.S. government support for what we consider a
brutal military dictatorship.''
   The United States has sent nearly $3 billion in military and
economic aid to El Salvador during the last eight years, according
to the State Department. The Reagan administration says the aid has
resulted in democratic and economic reforms.
   But opponents say the aid has bolstered military control of the
country and that human-rights abuses and killings by death squads
are rampant.
   The ads, designed by internationally renowned artist John
Baldessari, supply a phone number that readers can call for more
information.
   The ads, in English and Spanish, will reach an estimated 4.5
million New Yorkers, said D'Elia.

<HEAD>Agreement Near On U.S. Bases, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philippine and U.S. officials said
today they have narrowed differences over U.S. military bases here
and are nearing agreement on their status through 1991.
   President Corazon Aquino and U.S. Undersecretary of State
Michael Armacost gave the assessment after a 45-minute meeting,
which the U.S. official described as a ``very good talk.''
   Filipino and American panels began talks last April on the
status of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller
installations. But the talks have stalled over compensation and
other issues.
   Armacost told reporters after the meeting that Foreign Secretary
Raul Manglapus and Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur met
Wednesday in New York on the bases talks.
   ``Progress is being made and the hope was there for an early
agreement,'' he said.
   In a statement to Filipino reporters later, Mrs. Aquino said she
received a call from Manglapus today and that ``he sounded very
optimistic and confident.''
   The United States maintains the bases under a 1947 agreement
that expires in 1991. The current talks are to determine
compensation and other issues through the final two years of the
agreement.
   After that, any extension must be approved by two-thirds of the
23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases is strong. Mrs.
Aquino refuses to say whether she will support an extension.
   Also today, leaders of a new party backing Aquino pushed through
a plan to reorganize the House of Representatives but agreed to
maintain an alliance with other coalition members.
   The move would give the party, the Struggle of the Democratic
Filipino, clear control of the House as the majority party and
force other rival but non-opposition parties to accept their
minority status, politicians said.
   After a closed-door meeting of pro-Aquino legislators, House
speaker Ramon Mitra announced that a majority voted to reorganize
House committees and that at least five chairmen had tendered
``courtesy resignations.''
   He said party leaders would continue meeting to decide on a
system of apportioning chairmanships of the House's 43 committees.
The reorganization was expected to be completed next week, he said.
   Creation of the party triggered so much realignment within the
coalition that the new group wound up the biggest
pro-administration party with 158 of the 203 seats in the House. It
has seven seats in the 23-member Senate.

<HEAD>Study: Abortion Rate Higher Among Catholics Than Protestants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mixed feelings about contraceptives among
Catholic women could explain why a study found their abortion rate
is 30 percent higher than that of Protestant women, said the
president of a private reproductive health foundation.
   ``Religion appears to play some role in the abortion decision
but not in the expected direction,'' wrote Jeannie Rosoff,
president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which conducted the
study.
   The findings emerged from two separate national surveys
conducted by the New York-based institute in 1987 and 1988.
   ``The groups which have the most ambivalence about the use of
contraceptives probably don't use contraceptives as well as other
groups in the population,'' said the study, released Wednesday.
   Contraception, as well as abortion, is forbidden by the Roman
Catholic Church.
   ``Nearly one-third of all women who choose abortion report a
fear of others discovering that they had become pregnant,'' the
study said. ``Catholic women are more likely than those of other
denominations to choose abortion for this reason.''
   The abortion rate among Catholic women is also higher than that
among Jewish women, it said.
   Women who describe themselves as ``born-again'' or evangelical
Christians were half as likely as other women to have abortions,
the study said.
   The study arrived at its conclusions by comparing the number of
women of each religion among abortion patients to the number of
women of that religion in the general public.
   According to the study, nearly three of every 100 American women
aged 15 to 44 had an abortion last year, a figure that remained
constant for a decade.
   The abortion rate among Hispanic women was 4.3 per 100, while
the rate among non-Hispanic white women was 2.3 per 100. Non-white
women, most of whom were black, had an abortion rate of 5.3 per 100.
   Women who said they were Roman Catholics had an abortion rate
that was about the same as the American average of 3 per 100. The
rates among women who described themselves as Protestant or Jewish
were 30 percent below the national average.
   ``It is not clear how the effects of religious affiliation are
influenced by other socioeconomic factors, or, for that matter, by
differences in the use of contraception which affect the need to
make a decision about abortion,'' Rosoff added.
   About half of the women having abortions became pregnant because
their contraceptive method failed or because they used it
incorrectly.
   In both surveys, the researchers noted that women increasingly
must work outside the home for economic reasons, and that to do so
they must have an adequate education.
   ``Both of these aims can be threatened by an accidental
pregnancy, not only among young, unmarried women, but also among
older, married women,'' the study said.
   One study surveyed 1,900 women nationwide who had abortions in
30 facilities. The other queried nearly 10,000 women who obtained
abortions during 1987 at 103 clinics, hospitals and doctors'
offices in all regions of the country.
   Susan Tew, a spokeswoman for the institute, said the margin of
error was not available.

<HEAD>Rowan Says Gun-Possession Trial Hasn't Changed His Views</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

   Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan said his
inconclusive trial on weapons-possession charges, which have been
dropped, did not alter his views on gun control.
   ``I never said I wouldn't use whatever was at hand to repel (an
invader),'' Rowan said Wednesday after District of Columbia
authorities announced they were dropping the charges. ``I did it in
that case, and I would do it again.''
   Rowan had been charged with using an unregistered handgun and
ammunition in shooting a teen-ager who took an unauthorized dip in
his pool last June. A two-day trial led to a hung jury.
   Rowan, who has used his columns to speak out in favor of gun
control, told a news conference in Kansas City, Mo., he still
supported enacting a federal law ``that makes it extremely
difficult for anyone but a law-enforcement officer to have a gun.''
   He added: ``I have never said that I would not own a gun, or
that I won't in the future.''
   The teen-ager who was shot, Ben Smith, of suburban Chevy Chase,
Md., told the Montgomery Journal in a telephone interview from
Boston that he doesn't understand the district's reasoning.
   ``I guess it's the District of Columbia coming through again,''
Smith said.
   ``From the start, I thought that if anyone tried to kill
somebody that they should be charged with assault,'' Smith said.
``It's all politics.''
   A District of Columbia Superior Court jury that heard the
weapons charges against Rowan became deadlocked in deliberations
last Thursday, and a mistrial was declared.
   Frederick D. Cooke, the District of Columbia corporation
counsel, said the city decided not to seek a new trial.
   ``While I continue to believe that Mr. Rowan, in fact and in
law, committed the offenses for which he was prosecuted ... the
district's ability to obtain a fair hearing in this matter has been
undermined,'' Cooke said.
   ``I don't believe either Mr. Rowan or the government in this
case can get a unanimous verdict.''
   Rowan said the gun he fired was given to him by his son, Carl Jr.
   The son testified during the two-day trial that he had
repeatedly been rebuffed in his efforts to register the .22 caliber
pistol with city police officials in 1982 and 1983.
   Rowan Jr., who was an FBI agent at the time he asked about
registration requirements, testified that officers in the police
department's gun control unit told him he was exempt from
registration requirements because he was a law enforcement officer.
   Rowan Jr. also claimed that the same officers told him it would
be ``no problem'' if others in his family had access to the weapon.

<HEAD>`Killing Fields' Survivor Assails U.N. For Seating Khmer Rouge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Photographer Dith Pran, who barely escaped
Cambodia's killing fields, denounced the United Nations for
allowing the Khmer Rouge to be seated as part of the Cambodian
delegation.
   ``I am still shocked when I see the Khmer Rouge flag on U.N.
territory. How would you feel if you were Jewish and you saw
Hitler's flag flying at the U.N.?'' Dith said Wednesday to a crowd
of about 250 demonstrators.
   In 1975, when the Khmer Rouge toppled Cambodia's government,
Dith was trapped in the country. Like most of the population, he
endured famine and forced labor on a collective farm, but managed
to escape to Thailand in 1979.
   Dith is now a photographer for The New York Times. His ordeal,
and that of his people, received worldwide attention in the movie
``The Killing Fields.''
   About 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million people died under the
Khmer Rouge's attempt to impose agrarian communism from 1975 to
1979. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ousted Pol Pot's
Khmer Rouge regime.
   Wednesday's protest coincided with Cambodia's speech to the 43rd
General Assembly, with the Khmer Rouge sharing a seat in the
delegation. The vigil was organized by the Oxfam America relief
agency.
   Oxfam's executive director John Hammock and several of its
officers began a three-day fast Wednesday to protest the Khmer
Rouge membership in the United Nations.
   ``There is no justice yet,'' said Dith, his voice strained with
anger. ``Justice and peace haven't come to my country. ... I want
to see the Cambodians happy. I want to see Cambodians smiling
again.''
   In an effort to root all Western influence out of Cambodia, the
Khmer Rouge renamed 1975 ``Year Zero,'' and sent city-dwellers to
work on collective farms.
   Dith was among the forced laborers until he escaped across the
Thai border to a refugee camp.
   Oxfam, Dith, and many Cambodians fear that the Khmer Rouge, the
best armed of the three groups fighting the Phnom Penh government,
will seize power. The Khmer Rouge are backed by China.
   Hanoi has said it will withdraw 50,000 of its 120,000 occupation
troops from Cambodia this year and that all are to be out by late
1989 or early 1990.
   Many people fear the Khmer Rouge will fill the military and
political void left by the retreating Vietnamese.
   The resistance coalition also includes the non-communist Khmer
People's National Liberation Front of Son Samm and forces loyal to
former Cambodian head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Under the U.N. Charter and international law, the United Nations
says it cannot recognize a government imposed on a country by
outside force, such as the current Cambodian government installed
by Hanoi.

   Dr. George Hatem, an American who served as
doctor for Mao Tse-tung's Red Army and became the first non-Chinese
citizen of the People's Republic of China, has died of cancer. He
was 78.
   Ministry of Public Health official Xu Qiuju said today that
Hatem died Monday morning. Family members said there would be a
public viewing of the body on Monday.
   Hatem, who was born in 1910 to poor Lebanese immigrants in
Buffalo, N.Y., is largely credited with organizing programs to
eradicate venereal disease in China and reduce cases of leprosy by
80 percent.
   He was a senior adviser to the Ministry of Public Health since
1979 and sat on the government's top advisory body, the Chinese
Peoples' Political Consultative Conference.
   Dr. Steven B. Sample, president of the State University of New
York at Buffalo, said in a statement that ``over the past
half-century, he led the fight against dreadful diseases like
cholera, venereal disease and leprosy in China and in the process
saved the lives of many millions of Chinese.''
   After graduating from the University of North Carolina, Hatem
studied medicine at American University in Beirut and received his
medical degree from the University of Geneva. In 1933, he and two
other doctors went to Shanghai to study tropical medicine. Hatem
lived in China for the rest of his life.
   ``All around me were poverty, malnutrition and exploitation,''
Hatem said in a 1983 interview. ``I found the social evils of old
China were more fatal to the poor than illness. The problem was not
only medical but political.''
   Hatem said in 1984 that he first read Karl Marx's Communist
Manifesto in Shanghai: ``Its impact on me was immediate. I thought
then, and think now, that the poorer you are, the more easily you
understand the Manifesto.
   In 1936, Hatem and Edgar Snow, the journalist-author of the
classic ``Red Star over China,'' answered Mao's call for a
``Western-trained doctor and an honest journalist.'' They made
their way through Nationalist lines to join the Communists in their
northwestern China stronghold. For the next 13 years, until the
Communist triumph, Hatem served as medical adviser to the Red Army.
   In 1950, Hatem became the first non-Chinese citizen of the new
China. He took on the Chinese name of Ma Haide. Haide means
``virtue from across the seas.''
   In 1953, Hatem helped organize the Dermatology and Venereology
Research Institute and by the end of the decade, China claimed that
once-pandemic syphilis and gonorrhea had been eliminated. Venereal
disease has again become a minor problem in recent years as China's
open-door policy increases contacts with the outside world.
   In the 1960s, Hatem turned to a new program to control leprosy,
with a goal of eradicating the disease, which still afflicts about
70,000 Chinese, by the year 2000.
   His death had not yet been reported in the tightly controlled
official Chinese press, possibly because it occurred during Chinese
National Day holidays.
   Hatem is survived by his wife of 50 years, Chou Sufei; a son; a
daughter; a sister; and four grandchildren.

<HEAD>New Law Bans Smoking by Police, Firefighters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state law banning new police officers and
firefighters from smoking at home or at work goes into effect
today, and union officials predicted that it would be challenged in
court the first time it is enforced.
   ``Someone is going to question the constitutionality of putting
restrictions on people at home,'' said Ray McGrath, a spokesman for
the International Brotherhood of Police Officers.
   The penalty for lighting up is dismissal.
   The union says it is strongly opposed to the law. Several public
safety unions agreed to the law after current police officers and
firefighters were exempted from the no-smoking regulation.
   The exemption also applies to people who took a qualifying exam
or were already on a civil service hiring list before the measure
was adopted.
   The regulation was passed as part of a pension reform bill and
its justification is economic. State law holds that any heart or
lung disease contracted by firefighters or police officers is a
job-related disability. The state could save large sums of money by
reducing smoke-related heart-lung ailments by keeping smokers off
the forces.

<HEAD>Medvedev Endorses Importing of Economic Ideas from West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's new ideology chief said
socialism must learn from the West and try the kind of bold
economic experiments President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed.
   In his first major speech since being catapulted onto the ruling
Politburo, Vadim Medvedev said some of Gorbachev's reforms have
fostered abuses, but in general he showed himself a closer ally of
the Soviet leader than his predecessor as ideology chief, Yegor K.
Ligachev.
   Some Western diplomatic analysists had predicted Medvedev, seen
as a reform economist, would be charged with redefining socialism
to incorporate Gorbachev's pragmatic approach to rebuilding the
Soviet economy.
   His remarks, published Wednesday in the newspapers Pravda and
Izvestia, appeared to begin that process. But he took a cautious
first step.
   ``Unfortunately, there have been some irresponsible attempts to
cast a shadow over Lenin's inheritance, over the basic values of
socialism,'' Medvedev said.
   ``And how else can those statements appearing in the press be
interpreted that claim that the command-administrative system
resulted from Lenin, those attempts to deny the socialist nature of
our system, that even doubt the rightness of our choice for
socialism?''
   Medvedev, 59, a political economist by training, was named to
the Communist Party Politburo on Friday by the party's
policy-making Central Committee and was named to head a newly
created commission on ideology.
   He spoke Tuesday to an international conference in Moscow on the
problems of contemporary socialism.
   In his reported remarks, Medvedev showed himself more open to
following the Western example to help solve Soviet problems than
was Ligachev, the Politburo member reputed to be a conservative
opponent of Gorbachev.
   But some Soviets who read Medvedev's speech in the national
press said it was impossible to conclude that the newest Politburo
member had completely embraced Gorbachev's reform agenda.
   The party's new ideology chief spoke of the need for ``deep
qualitative rejuvenation'' in socialism, and said the solution to
some Soviet problems could come from other socialist countries, and
even from the West.
   ``While the socialist perspective is being worked out, the
experience of humanity as a whole cannot be ignored, including the
non-socialist part of the world,'' Medvedev said.
   ``I'm referring not only to the scientific and technical
achievements of the system that is opposed to us, but to many forms
of organization of public life, of the economic process.''
   Medvedev also urged a rethinking of the role of central planning
and the market, and voiced support for two pillars of Gorbachev's
program for ``perestroika,'' or nationwide restructuring: leasing
farmland to individual farmers and spreading economic cooperatives
to provide consumer goods that are lacking in the state sector.
   Ligachev, in an Aug. 5 speech, said the class struggle
determines international relations. But Medvedev hewed more closely
to Gorbachev's line, which maintains that in the nuclear age, East
and West must cooperate to solve common problems.
   ``The conception is outdated that socialism and capitalism can
develop in a parallel way,'' Medvedev said. ``On the contrary,
their ways will inevitably intersect, both systems will inevitably
interact within the framework of the same human civilization.''

   A woman who gave her 4-year-old son a fatal
dose of prescription drugs has undergone sterilization in hopes of
receiving a lenient sentence, her attorney says.
   Melody S. Baldwin, 29, was sterilized Tuesday at Wishard
Memorial Hospital, said Michael J. Donahoe.
   ``The primary factor in fashioning the sentence for anyone is
the likelihood of repeat behavior,'' Donahoe said Wednesday. ``I
think we're going to be able to assure the court that nothing like
this will happen again.''
   Superior Court Judge Roy E. Jones had suggested he would be
lenient if she underwent the procedure.
   Baldwin pleaded guilty June 10 to neglect of a dependent and, in
exchange, prosecutors dropped a murder charge. She faces a maximum
sentence of 20 years in prison at sentencing Nov. 9, compared to a
20- to 50-year term for murder.
   She was accused of having ``knowingly administered'' lethal
doses of two psychotropic drugs to her son, Joshua, in 1986.
   Baldwin gave birth to a son Sunday and gave him up for adoption,
Donahoe said.

<HEAD>World Leaders Applaud Chileans' Rejection Of Pinochet Rule</HEAD>

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Italian politicians rose to their feet in Parliament today and
applauded the news that Chile rejected Gen. Augusto Pinochet's bid
to extend his presidency until 1997.
   The reaction was similar in Britain, Spain and France, where
lawmakers hailed the decision by voters to reject Pinochet in
Wednesday's national referendum. Open elections are to be held next
year for the first time since 1970.
   In Athens, spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said Greece's Socialist
government was ``pleased about the advance of the democratic
opposition ... and will salute with complete satisfaction their
final predominance.''
   Britain's Foreign Office said the government was encouraged.
   ``We hope that the plebiscite result, which appears to reflect
the will of the Chilean people, will represent an important first
step on the path back towards full democracy,'' a statement said.
   The West German government called on Chile's military leaders to
abide by terms for the nation's democratization.
   ``We hope that the government will now hold to its own promised
timetable and continue on a course to allow open and free
elections,'' said government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling.
   Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian Democrat, said:
``The government over which I am presiding pledges to be near the
Chilean people in the difficult struggle for the conquest of
democracy.''
   Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, also a Christian Democrat,
said in a statement that ``the victory of the opposition is very
important. The historic tradition of Chile is democratic.''
   Italy was the scene of numerous demonstrations when Pinochet
seized power in a 1973 coup that ousted President Salvador Allende,
a Marxist. Through the years, many Chileans have taken exile in
Italy.
   In Britain, George Foulkes, a foreign affairs spokesman for the
opposition Labor Party, was among 500 foreigners called to Chile by
opposition groups there to act as election observers.
   ``It's a tremendous triumph for democracy in Chile, a totally
unique situation where a dictator has been voted out in a
plebiscite,'' Foulkes said.
   ``It is absolutely crucial now to ensure that Pinochet fully
accepts the decision of the Chilean people,'' he said.
   Jacques Arnold, a lawmaker in the governing Conservative Party
and secretary of the House of Commons Latin American Group, noted
that Pinochet was not without support.
   ``The most important thing is that despite all the cards against
him, particularly on human rights, this old man of 72 achieved a
considerable vote,'' he said.
   All Spanish political parties represented in Parliament hailed
the referendum's outcome.
   ``The triumph of the `no' (vote) represents the rejection by the
majority of a dictatorial regime and the process that the regime
designed to perpetuate its hold on power,'' a statement from the
governing Spanish Socialist party said.
   Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said ``the
people of Chile have given a great lesson of political maturity.''
   Pierre Mauroy, first secretary of the French Socialist Party and
a former premier, called the vote ``an immense victory, after 15
years of dictatorship and suffering.''
   Laurent Fabius, speaker of the French National Assembly, said on
French radio the result was ``a great day'' for Chile.
   ``It's a country which suffered terribly for 15 years ... and
now, all of a sudden, there is light and hope again,'' he said.
   In Brussels, Belgium, an official of the European Economic
Community Commission said the referendum result showed that in
Chile and elsewhere ``man triumphs as he fights for liberty and the
respect of his fundamental rights.''
   Claude Cheysson, the EEC's commissioner for North-South matter,
also urged Chilean authorities to restore democracy as quickly as
possible.

<HEAD>Approval Near on Plan To Close Unneeded Military Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is nearing approval of a proposal
that finally may overcome strong political opposition and save
millions of dollars by closing unneeded military bases.
   ``There's no question the issue of closing bases is very
difficult politically,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee. ``Closed bases mean lost jobs,
and nobody in Congress likes to lose jobs.''
   ``This is a one-shot proposition,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``You've got an
opportunity to do this because we're changing administrations and
there's a sense this could be done fairly now.''
   Nunn and Aspin spoke late Wednesday, shortly after House and
Senate negotiators agreed on the complicated details of a bill that
could mean the first major base closings since 1977.
   Final floor approval by the House and Senate is likely later
this week, Aspin and Nunn agreed.
   The bill could mean that up to 25 of the nation's 550 largest
bases could be shut down starting in 1990, Aspin said. Nunn
declined to estimate a number, saying, ``I don't know what they'll
come up with.''
   The measure creates a 12-member commission which would have
until Dec. 31 to send Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci a
recommended list of bases. He would have to either accept or reject
the entire list by Jan. 15, only five days before the Reagan
administration leaves office.
   A 10-member commission has been at work for five months,
preparing its findings. The two new members would be added to that
panel.
   If Congress objects to the list, it could only block the
closings by House and Senate approval next spring of a bill killing
the plan, but that bill could be vetoed by the new president.
   ``It's much better for an outgoing administration, an outgoing
secretary of defense, to take that responsibility,'' Nunn said.
``He's going to make a lot of enemies, politically. We have a
person now who is willig to take that heat.''
   Pentagon officials have estimated that between $2 billion and $5
billion a year could be saved if they are allowed to close outdated
bases.
   But Aspin disputed that figure. The $5 billion estimate is
``financial hyperbole,'' he said, predicting savings of several
hundred million dollars a year.
   Nunn declined to estimate. ``I think the savings may be very
significant, but I don't know yet what the figures will be.''
   Military bases mean jobs, and since 1977, Congress has enacted a
stiff, complex series of laws which effectively have blocked the
Pentagon from closing any of the 3,800 military installations in
the contintental United States, including the 550 larger bases.
Those laws would be waived by the current proposal.
   Until 1977, the Pentagon generally had been allowed to have its
way on base closings, particularly in the years after World War II
when the nation's large military machine was being mothballed.
Between 1961 and 1977, the Defense Department closed 3,600
installations.
   The change came after the Air Force proposed closing Loring Air
Force Base in northern Maine. That state's congressional delegation
blocked the plan by by winning approval of legislation requiring
long and costly environmental studies, an action followed later by
other legislators.
   The current commission is headed by former Rep. Jack Edwards,
R-Ala., and former Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, D-Conn.
   ``Politically, they have a very difficult job, and they have to
be astute,'' Aspin said. ``The list they come up with has to be
politically balanced. It can't have too many from one area of the
country, like the South or the West, and too few from another area.
And it has to be perceived as being equally divided in terms of
hurting Democratic and Republicans in Congress.''

<TEXT>
   A student who failed an economics test
twice has filed a lawsuit seeking to force the University of
Central Florida to award her a master's degree in business
administration or refund her $5,000 tuition.
   Nora Roth, 48, claims she earned her master's degree with good
grades in her classwork, although she couldn't pass a final test.
   ``After paying all my dues and having a good (grade point)
average I just feel abused,'' Mrs. Roth said. ``I really don't want
their money. I just want what I earned, which is a master's
degree.''
   The economics test is a required review of all four elements of
the material: finance, management, marketing and economics.
   Mrs. Roth passed the three other parts of the test but failed
the economics section. She hired a tutor, crammed for another
semester and took the test again. She failed again.
   She filed the lawsuit last week with the help of her husband
Kenneth, who is a lawyer.
   She claims the test is unfair because the school's economics
professors hold different economic theories and place emphasis on
different areas of the subject. Her test was prepared by a
professor she did not study under and included material she had
never studied, Mrs. Roth contends.
   Dean Clifford Eubanks of the university's College of Business
defended the test, which he said is common at colleges across the
country. Eubanks said Tuesday it was not uncommon for students to
fail the test several times and added that Mrs. Roth can take it
again.

<HEAD>Lawyer To Fight Genetic Test Of Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer says he will try to prevent a
genetic test that could determine whether his client's 9-year-old
daughter was switched at birth and is actually the child of a
Pennsylvania couple.
   A hearing is scheduled for Friday at which the couple, Ernest
and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., plan to ask a judge to order
that the Sarasota girl produce a blood sample.
   ``You can't just allow people to come in with suspicions and
demand blood tests,'' Arthur Ginsburg, a lawyer for the father,
said Wednesday.
   The Twiggs contend their healthy newborn daughter was swapped
nearly 10 years ago for a sickly one at Hardee Memorial Hospital in
Wauchula.
   The child they raised, Arlena, died of heart problems Aug. 23,
shortly after a genetic test determined she was not biologically
related to the couple, the Twiggs said.
   The Twiggs filed a $100 million lawsuit against Hardee Memorial,
three doctors and a nurse, alleging fraud and negligence. They also
have said they want to find and regain custody of their biological
daughter.
   That search has focused on another blue-eyed blonde who,
according to state records, was born at Hardee three days before
Mrs. Twigg gave birth. The couple believe their real daughter now
lives in Sarasota.
   Ginbsurg said his client is certain he is the biological father
and intends to keep the girl he has raised and loved for 10 years
regardless of what a test would show.
   A genetic test ``can't make him feel any more the father,''
Ginsburg said, ``and I can't see how it will do us any good.''
   Ginsburg said the couple has not presented convincing evidence
that the Twiggs are the true parents and deserve a blood test.
   Marvin Ellin, an attorney for the couple, said no firm evidence
is required to bring a court action to determine paternity.

   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres forced his
way through a hostile crowd today during a campaign tour of an open
air market where youths taunted the Labor Party candidate with
shouts of ``Peres go home.''
   Aides to Peres described the confrontation in this town, a
traditional stronghold of the rival right-wing Likud bloc, as the
worst of the campaign for the Nov. 1 parliamentary elections.
   Security guards subdued one man who tried to throw a tomato at
Peres, while scores of youths in blue and white Likud shirts shoved
their way toward Peres.
   The protesters also shouted ``Begin, Begin,'' the name of the
former Likud prime minister, Menachem Begin, and mocked Peres'
moderate policies toward Arabs with cries of ``Arafat, PLO.''
   In a speech later to a more sympathetic audience of elderly
people in a shopping plaza, Peres stressed that Labor's peace
strategy was aimed at avoiding a demographic problem with Arabs.
   ``We are 3.5 million Jews in Israel and there are 2.4 million
Arabs'' in territory controlled by Israel, Peres said. ``If Likud
succeeds and annexes the territories, we are going to have an Arab
majority. It is the Likud then that will make a Palestinian state.''
   On Wednesday, the Likud leader, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
vowed that if he is re-elected, Israel will not withdraw from the
occupied territories or allow an independent Palestinian state.
   Shamir spoke in a working class suburb of Tel Aviv and accused
Labor of pursuing a dangerous policy ``leading to pressure on us to
abandon every achievement the Israeli nation made in the Six Day
War, including united Jerusalem.''
   It was in that war in June 1967 that Israel sized the West Bank
and Gaza Strip and annexed Arab east Jerusalem.
   Aides said Peres was upset by the pushing and shoving today in
the Ramle market, although he showed no signs of it as he walked
stony-faced in shirt sleeves through the town of 46,000, several
miles from Tel Aviv.
   ``It demonstrates a certain style that a better part of the
Israeli people do not like to see,'' Peres told The Associated
Press.
   In Jerusalem, meanwhile, the 40-member Central Elections
Committee rejected a bid by right-wing parties to disqualify a
leftist Jewish-Arab party, claiming its support for dialogue with
the PLO would undermine the Jewish state.
   On Wednesday, the board disqualified U.S.-born right-wing
extremist Meir Kahane from running in the elections, saying his
calls to expel Arabs were racist and illegal. Kahane is appealing
the decision to the Supreme Court.
   Peres' colleague, Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev, proposed
Wednesday that Israel remove troops from certain Arab towns to cool
tensions until a land-for-peace compromise could be worked out with
the Palestinians.
   The Likud bloc opposes yielding any of the Arab lands Israel
captured in 1967 on the grounds that territorial concessions would
endanger security.
   The Likud also rejects a Labor-backed proposal to convene an
international peace conference including the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council, Israel, Jordan, a Palestinian
delegation and Egypt.
   Shamir has said Israel would be isolated in a hostile forum and
forced to give up the occupied territories.
   Since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8, more than 280 Palestinians
have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Six Israelis also
have died.

   Officials see no sign that other
American hostages in Lebanon may be freed in the wake of a
captive's release earlier this week, a U.S. State Department
official said.
   The official, who came to this city with a State Department team
to debrief the freed hostage, also said Wednesday the Reagan
administration assumes the kidnappers are financed by Iran.
   Doctors here said freed hostage Mithileshwar Singh, a
60-year-old Indian citizen and resident alien of the United States,
was in good spirits. But they said he faces tremendous stress as a
result of his 20-month ordeal.
   U.S. Air Force spokesman Master Sgt. Charles Fick said today
that Singh, was resting at the Air Force's Wiesbaden hospital had
decided not hold a press conference.
   Singh has not spoken to reporters since his arrival in West
Germany.
   The spokesman later said Singh ``feels much better today'' and
would be examined by a stress mananagement team, dentists, eye
doctors and physical therapists. He had no further details.
   The debriefing team arrived in Wiesbaden, about 25 miles from
Frankfurt, shortly after Singh was flown from Syria early
Wednesday. Debriefing began that day and continued today.
   The group hopes to gain new information from him on the status
of nine Americans missing in Lebanon.
   After arriving in Damascus, Singh said three American educators
abducted with him and remaining in captivity were ``OK.''
   Armed men dressed as policemen took Singh hostage Jan. 24, 1987,
on the Beirut University College campus in Moslem west Beirut,
along with Americans Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner.
All four taught at the school.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibility and said it freed Singh as a
goodwill gesture.
   He arrived at the U.S. Air Force Hospital in Wiesbaden two days
after his release in Beirut.
   His freedom sparked hopes for release of the 16 foreign hostages
still held in Lebanon. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   However, the U.S. State Department official painted a gloomy
picture at a news conference at the hospital Wednesday.
   ``One wants to be encouraged that they will be released, but we
really don't know,'' said the official.
   ``There are no indications that others are coming out,'' said
the U.S. expert when asked about the American hostages in Lebanon.
   The official, an expert on hostage issues, requested anonymity,
although he was speaking at a news conference before several dozen
journalists. Television crews were ordered not to film the comments.
   Characterizing the kidnappers, the State Department official
said: ``It is our opinion that they are under the influence of Iran
and are part of Hezbollah.''
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella
organization for several pro-Iranian groups holding foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   Later, the U.S. official elaborated: ``There are indications
that they (the hostage-takers) are backed by Iran, we assume
financed by Iran.''
   Meanwhile, Singh was being examined at the Wiesbaden hospital.
   Dr. Robert W. Gilmore, the hospital chief, told Wednesday's news
conference that said Singh has told officials he wants to return to
Colorado after his medical tests. He once taught at the now-defunct
Western Colorado University.

   A spokesman for the commission now sponsoring
the second presidential debate says it is seeking a new location
because the League of Women Voters held the original debate site in
Los Angeles ``hostage.''
   Bob Neuman, director of media arrangements for the Commission on
Presidential Debates, said Wednesday the League of Women Voters was
demanding $90,000 in payments before releasing the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles.
   Neuman said the commission still wants the second and final
debate between George Bush and Michael Dukakis to be held in Los
Angeles.
   But the League on Wednesday moved to secure the hall by placing
a $40,000 deposit on it _ two days after the group announced it was
backing out as sponsor of the debate in a dispute over control of
format and staging details, he said.
   Neuman said the League was demanding repayment of the deposit
plus $50,000 reimbursement for expenses before releasing the hall
to the bipartisan commission for the debate, to be held Oct. 13 or
Oct. 14, depending on the length of the Major League Baseball
playoffs.
   ``What they're telling us is they're willing to spend $40,000 to
keep the hall empty,'' Neuman, in Omaha for the vice presidential
debate, said.
   ``We consider that holding the hall hostage,'' he said. ``We're
not going to deal with them.''
   In Washington, League spokeswoman Stephanie Drea said Neuman's
allegations were ``absurd'' and ``an unfortunate ploy to try to
embarrass the League.''
   She said the non-profit League was not holding the Shrine
Auditorium hostage but was merely seeking reimbursement for the
$40,000 deposit and costs of preparing the hall for the debate,
including broadcast equipment and fire safety precautions.
   She said the commitment for the deposit was made long before the
League decided to withdraw its sponsorship of the event.
   ``We got the ball rolling,'' she said. ``Now they can pick it up
and run with it. We should be reimbursed for our very real costs
that have gone into planning for that debate, and no more.''
   The nationally broadcast debate was to have been sponsored by
the League of Women Voters on Thursday or Friday of next week.
   However, league officials, angered by refusal of the two
presidential campaigns to give up control of the format and staging
details, withdrew.
   Commission Executive Director Janet Brown, in Omaha to direct
commission handling of the vice presidential debate, said the
commission was looking for local donors to pay for putting on the
second presidential debate. She said the first debate in
Winston-Salem, N.C., cost $500,000 to stage, and the Los Angeles
one would cost at least that much.
   Neuman said he remained optimistic the debate would be held,
despite the dispute over the hall.

<TEXT>
   A team of U.S. and Vietnamese
investigators found two sets of human remains and debris from a
wrecked aircraft during an unprecedented search for the airmen
missing in the Vietnam war, officials say.
   Four Americans, meanwhile, floated dollar bills down the Mekong
River in Laos today to spread news of a $2.4 million reward for
prisoners of war they say still may be alive.
   The group also said it would direct a remote control toy boat to
the Laotian shore to carry offers of the reward.
   Two other Americans were arrested on a similar mission and were
believed still being held Wednesday by authorities in Laos.
   One set of remains located by the U.S.-Vietnamese search team
was found at the Lang Son province bordering China with the remains
of Vietnamese, and probably is not American, U.S. investigators
said.
   But Bill Bell, a U.S. team leader, said searchers found areas
where other remains might be buried and recovered pieces of
aircraft wreckage. They finished their eight-day search through
five provinces near Hanoi on Tuesday.
   The U.S. specialists left Wednesday for Bangkok, Thailand, but
planned to return to Hanoi on Friday to discuss their findings and
the possibility of more joint work, including excavations of crash
sites.
   The teams trekked through steep mountains in pouring monsoon
rains to reach sites where six airmen were shot down during the
war, which ended in 1975.
   Villagers led investigators to two sets of remains, in Lang Son
and Ha Nam Ninh provinces, said Nguyen Can, head of Vietnam's
Office For Seeking Missing Personnel.
   Can said the remains will be given to the United States after
preliminary analysis by Vietnamese forensic experts. He said
Vietnam does not have equipment for identifying the teeth, the key
part of both sets of remains.
   It was the first time Vietnam allowed U.S. experts to probe the
countryside and because it may resolve some cases Washington
considers top priority among the 1,757 missing in Vietnam.
   Meanwhile, a private group of searchers believes missing
servicemen are alive in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The four Americans threw $25 to $30 into the river, which flows
on to Cambodia and Vietnam, as a ``test'' and planned to drop more
than $2,000 in American and other currencies Friday from the Thai
shore.
   The boat, donated by a Florida toy manufacturer named Jim Rambo,
is to be remote steered to the Laotian shore and left there. The
speedy, 2.5-foot boat is festooned with a flag reading ``You
(missing in action) are not forgotten.''
   ``We are absolutely steadfast that this reward effort will
work,'' said Bruce Adams, of Laramie, Wyo., whose brother was
listed as MIA in Laos 22 years ago.
   The other members of the group are Ted Sampley, a former Green
Beret from Kingston, N.C.; William Sullivan, of Jacksonville, N.C.,
a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War; and Lynn Hampton, of
Winter Haven, Fla., a nurse during the war.
   The group is the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans.
   Laotian authorities Sunday arrested two other members of the
group, Donna Long, 45, of Jacksonville, N.C., and James Copp, 43, a
Vietnam veteran from Hampstead, N.C., after they crossed the Mekong
River and landed in a Laotian village.
   Long and Copp carried about $3,000 as well as other currency.
Each bill was stamped with the reward offer.
   Ross Petzing, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok, said
Tuesday that Long and Copp were being held at Ban Sing Samphan in
the southern Laotian province of Champasak. He could not confirm
whether they were still in the village or had been moved to the
capital, Vientiane.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle said today he was not worried about a poll showing that many
television viewers thought he had lost Wednesday night's debate
with Democrat Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``George Bush is going to win the election. He's still way ahead
in the polls,'' Quayle said as he left a morning rally at his hotel.
   An ABC poll indicated that many TV viewers believed Bentsen had
trounced the Indiana senator. But Quayle, asked if he was concerned
about the poll, said, ``Not at all. We're still ahead.''
   Quayle told supporters at the rally that ``we now have a little
more than four weeks left in this campaign.''
   ``This election is going to be decided by the American people
and it's going to be decided on the issues,'' Quayle said.
   He headed for rallies in Missouri and Florida and a lunch with
former President Ford.
   After the debate, Quayle said the Texas senator had ``absolutely
no response to the fact that Michael Dukakis is simply out of step
with mainstream America.''
   Leaving the debate Wednesday night, the Indiana senator beamed
at reporters and pronounced his own performance ``great.''
   He insisted that he was pleased at having been grilled
repeatedly by the panelists about his qualifications for national
office.
   ``We were delighted that they brought it up three different
times because it gave us three different times to talk to the
American people about what I'll do for the country,'' Quayle said.
   The Republican vice presidential nominee received congratulatory
calls after the debate from Vice President George Bush, President
Reagan and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole.
   Bush told his running mate, ``You did great,'' said Quayle
spokesman David Prosperi.
   At a post-debate outdoor rally Wednesday night, Quayle told
2,000 flag-waving supporters that Bentsen ``had a difficult time
defending the liberal governor from Massachusetts.''
   ``There was absolutely no response to the fact that Michael
Dukakis is simply out of step with mainstream America,'' Quayle
said.
   Referring to Wednesday's American League playoff game in which
the Oakland Athletics beat the Boston Red Sox 2-1, Quayle said,
``This afternoon, the team from Massachusetts lost, and tonight,
the man from Massachusetts lost.''
   ``I feel great,'' Quayle said.
   But despite strong statements of victory by Quayle and his
advisers, early indications were that many people had doubts his
performance. An ABC poll of 637 viewers gave the round to Bentsen
by 51 percent to 27 percent, with a 4.5 percent margin of error.
   In particular, Quayle seemed to suffer during an exchange with
Bentsen on Quayle's oft-stated defense of his youth and
qualifications. Quayle, 41, said he had just as much experience in
Congress as John F. Kennedy did when, at 43, he ran for president.
   ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy,'' Bentsen said.
   Quayle told reporters outside the rally Wednesday night that
Bentsen's comments were ``uncalled for,'' a charge he had made
during the debate. Aides went further, calling it a ``cheap shot.''
   Late Wednesday, the campaign released a statement of ``Bentsen
distortions and errors.'' On the Kennedy question, the statement
said Quayle ``never said he was JFK; he simply compared his age and
level of experience in response to a question.''
   Prosperi, Quayle's spokesman, said the senator would be able to
put the Kennedy question and those about his qualifications
``behind him.''
   ``We'll focus the attention on Dukakis and on the fact that
Lloyd Bentsen couldn't defend his running mate,'' Prosperi said.
   Despite the heated exchange between the two nominees, Prosperi
noted that it had been Quayle who went over to Bentsen and
initiated the closing handshake ``before Bentsen even left the
podium.''
   ``It just shows he's a bigger man than Bentsen,'' Prosperi said.

   An estimated 50 million viewers tuned into the
vice presidential debate Wednesday night, according to preliminary
figures from the 16 largest television markets measured by the A.C.
Nielsen Co.
   U.S. Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and Dan Quayle, R-Ind., faced
off in the 90-minute debate, carried by all three networks and CNN
live from Omaha, Neb., at 8:30 p.m. EDT.
   According to Nielsen, ABC had a rating of 14.1 and a 22 share.
NBC had a 12.1 and 18. CBS had 8.8 and 13. Each rating point equals
904,000 households with televisions. The share is a percentage of
sets in use. That means 53 percent of the televisions that were on
during that time period were tuned to the debate.
   A National League playoff game in Los Angeles between the New
York Mets and the L.A. Dodgers had been rescheduled to follow the
debate. The game was carried by ABC.
   Ratings weren't available immediately for CNN.

   Michael Dukakis said today his running mate's
debate performance was ``a real plus for us'' and he laid claim to
momentum in the final weeks of the presidential race.
   The Democratic nominee said Lloyd Bentsen was ``knowledgeable
and relaxed'' during the Wednesday night encounter while Republican
Dan Quayle was ``programmed beyond belief.'' Dukakis characterized
Quayle as ``extremely insecure'' and lacking in ``strength,
confidence or anything.''
   ``This will be a real plus for us,'' Dukakis told reporters as
he flew to Texas to join Bentsen at a rally.
   Before he left Boston, Dukakis' campaign distributed a
blistering analysis of Quayle's performance, saying, ``Whenever
Senator Quayle deviated from his well-memorized script, his answers
were shallow, revealing his lack of substantive knowledge. He
appeared uninformed and a stranger to basic facts on almost every
issue.''
   The statement noted that Quayle was asked several times what he
would do if suddenly thrust into the presidency, and it said that
in every response, ``he failed.''
   Dukakis took time after the Wednesday night debate between
Bentsen and Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle to join supporters and deliver
his assessment of the vice presidential showdown, which he watched
at home.
   ``The most important qualification for a vice president is that
he's ready at a moment's notice to assume the presidency of the
United States,'' Dukakis told supporters waving American and Texas
flags. ``Tonight, Lloyd Bentsen demonstrated that he was the only
one on that stage who's ready.''
   Dukakis said he spoke to the Texas senator after the debate.
   ``I couldn't be prouder of him as my running mate,'' the
Massachusetts governor said. ``He's going to be a great vice
president.''
   Dukakis joined aides in claiming their man trounced Quayle,
particularly in demonstrating a grasp of the issues and showing
presidential confidence and leadership.
   ``What you saw was his strength, his maturity, his vision, his
toughness, his leadership _ all of the qualities that are so
important in a vice president and so important in a president, so
important to someone who is a heartbeat away from the presidency,''
Dukakis said. ``He's a great asset to our ticket.''
   The Democratic nominee also said the debate offered the voters a
chance to learn ``about how I make presidential decisions and the
way George Bush makes presidential decisions. My friends, tonight
that was no contest.''
   Dukakis said the Bentsen-Quayle debate, and his recent debate
with Bush, had helped focus the campaign on the ``real concerns of
mainstream Americans.'' That boded well for Democrats, he said.
   ``What is now beginning to happen is that with the American
people focused in on these two tickets, and on their concerns about
the future, they understand that this is a nation that is never
satisfied with the status quo and never will be. The reason we are
the greatest nation in the world is that we are always moving
forward, always trying to do better, always trying to build a
better future.''
   Dukakis then prompted a thunderous ovation by declaring: ``And
that's why we're going to win.''
   Later, he got the flags waving again by saying, ``On the 20th of
January 1989, the new era of greatness arrives.''
   Dukakis was back on the stump today after spending most of
Wednesday catching up on gubernatorial business.
   He took a break in the early afternoon to meet with reporters,
denouncing Bush's criticism of a Massachusetts furlough program
while dodging a question likely to come up during a Friday visit to
North Carolina _ whether he would have, like President Reagan,
vetoed legislation to protect the U.S. textile industry from
foreign competition.
   Bush has made his criticism of a Massachusetts furlough program
a staple of his campaign and has a new television ad accusing
Dukakis of running a ``revolving door'' prison system. At the
center of Bush's attacks is a case in which an inmate on furlough
raped a Maryland woman and assaulted her fiance.
   ``The vice president's record on crime and the fight against
drugs is pathetic,'' Dukakis said. ``It's been a failure and in my
judgment this is an effort to use the one case with a tragic
occurrence for political reasons. The vice president knows that the
federal government has a very extensive furlough program, knows
that Governor Reagan in California in the '70s had a very extensive
furlough program and tragedies as a result of that.''
   As for the textile bill, which would have placed strict new
limits on imports of textiles, apparel and shoes, Dukakis said he
favored legislation giving five years' protection to the industry
provided it agreed to modernize. There was no such provision in the
bill vetoed by Reagan but Dukakis said there would have been if he
was president.
   Dukakis refused to answer directly when asked whether he would
have signed the legislation as it was presented to Reagan.
   Dukakis also took to the airwaves with another round of ads,
four 30-second spots attacking Bush and his record on drug
enforcement, education, the environment and Social Security.

   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, heading to Texas for
a reunion with Michael Dukakis, pointed cheerfully today to polls
showing he won the debate with Republican Dan Quayle and said,
``Gee, those polls were great, weren't they?''
   Bentsen, stopping to speak with reporters as he left his hotel
this morning, also said he had been angered by Quayle's reference
to John F. Kennedy, which triggered the sharpest exchange of their
debate.
   The Texas senator and Democratic vice presidential nominee
disputed any suggestion that he had appeared nasty in his response
to Quayle over the Kennedy remark.
   ``What happened there was Quayle kept comparing himself to
Kennedy, and he overreached himself and I got fed up with it,''
Bentsen said.
   He pointed out that Kennedy was ``a war hero'' and had run a
nationwide campaign before being nominated president. Asked if he
was angered, he said, ``Sure, as a friend of Jack Kennedy, I deeply
resented his trying to put Kennedy's mantle over himself when he
didn't have a record that compared with Kennedy.''
   An Associated Press panel of veteran debate judges called
Bentsen the winner by a wide margin, and an instant ABC News poll
also gave the victory to the Democratic nominee.
   ``Gee, those polls were great weren't they... I was just
delighted,'' Bentsen said.
   ``I knew I was scoring points and I thought I was winning, but
it's difficult to be objective about yourself.''
   ``I had fun,'' the nominee said after his 90-minute televised
encounter with his Republican rival. ``I think we made our points.''
   Bentsen's principle point of the evening was his stinging retort
to Quayle's assertion that he has as much experience in Congress as
Kennedy had when he sought the presidency.
   ``Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy,'' Bentsen shot back at the
41-year-old junior senator from Indiana whose credentials have been
challenged since Bush selected him for the ticket.
   ``That was really uncalled for, senator,'' responded Quayle.
   Bentsen took a congratulatory phone call from Dukakis before
leaving Omaha Civic Auditorium after the debate, then spoke to 700
cheering supporters in a crowded hotel ballroom just down the
street.
   He made no mention of his remark on Kennedy, which was the
rhetorical and emotional high point of the contest. But he derided
Quayle for his handling of the repeated questioning he took on his
qualifications and what he would do if the presidency was thrust
upon him _ and he depicted Quayle as sticking close to his
advisers' coaching.
   ``You know, I stood up there for 90 minutes listening to Senator
Quayle say what he was going to do if he was president of the
United States and I still didn't know,'' Bentsen said.
   ``Finally I realized that all he was going to do was go back to
that script again.''
   Bentsen was making his first stop today at the Lone Star Steel
Co. near Longview in East Texas. Dukakis, who watched the debate
back home in Boston, was flying down to join him for the one
appearance. They were going their separate ways from there.
   Bentsen, added to the Democratic ticket amid hopes of carrying
giant Texas, was campaigning later in Dallas, and planned to stump
the state again Friday and Saturday as polls showed the Democratic
ticket trailing the Republicans in Texas by as many as 10
percentage points.
   As he left the debate site, Bentsen declined reporters' shouted
invitations to declare himself the winner. ``I think I did fine,
and I enjoyed it,'' he said.
   At the rally he stood before a banner that read ``and the winner
is Bentsen.'' He appealed to Democrats in the farm states of
Nebraska and, just across the Missouri River, Iowa, saying that
Quayle ``doesn't even know what they're talking about'' when farm
target prices are discussed.
   After days of intensive debate preparation, Bentsen tried to
relax Wednesday afternoon before the debate. The 67-year-old
senator displayed exhuberance in a pre-debate check of the
auditorium stage, lifting his wife, B.A., and carrying her off the
stage.
   Bentsen's debate jab at Quayle over his Kennedy comparison was
the object of much of the post-debate analysis or ``spinning,'' as
the partisan commentaries from both parties are called.
   His Democratic Senate colleagues chortled over the tense
exchange.
   ``I thought that was the knockout blow of the evening,'' said
California Sen. Alan Cranson.
   ``It was a devastating reply,'' said Louisiana Sen. Bennett
Johnston.
   But Republcan Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming sounded wounded,
saying: ``I think it was a cheap shot ... That was not the Lloyd
Bentsen I know.''

   The government proclaimed a state of
emergency today as police fought demonstrators who have rioted in
the streets for three days to protest rising prices.
   President Chadli Bendjedid said all civil administrative and
security services were placed under military command, but the
measures did not bring an immediate halt to the rioting. Arsonists
set fire to several government buildings.
   The decision was required by ``grave developments in the
situation in Algiers,'' Bendjedid said in a statement. He said the
state of emergency was invoked under the constitution.
   On Wednesday evening, fire destroyed the Ministry of Youth and
Sports, the government-sponsored soccer betting agency, the town
hall and numerous shops.
   Protesters set several more fires today, including one at a
Ministry of Education building. Looters were seen leaving the
building, and official files were blowing around in the wind
outside.
   Police anti-riot squads used force against groups of youths that
rioted in the streets of the capital this morning to protest the 15
percent annual inflation rate.
   One police unit armed with shields and riot sticks launched tear
gas grenades at a group of youngsters gathered near Algiers
University. Previously, the anti-riot squads remained in the
background during two days of unprecedented rioting in the city.
   It was not known today whether anyone was hurt during the
rioting. An unknown number of youths were arrested on charges of
looting. First estimates of the damage to the city exceeded $100
million.
   Under the government's econcomic reform program, prices for
basic food staples have risen dramatically. A pound of beef sells
for about $11.40 or more, and in some places drinking water is sold
for about $4 a gallon.
   Proclamation of the state of emergency came after Bendjedid and
the top members of his government met Wednesday night with the
National Liberation Front, the only political party; and the
leaders of the state-sponsored labor union.
   Rifle-toting soldiers in riot gear and steel helmets were
deployed today at the harbor, the bus station, the seafront
National Assembly building, the headquarters of the ruling party,
and the courtyard of the national radio and television service.
   The streets were almost deserted with the exception of a few
cars and buses that made their way between vehicles wrecked in
Wednesday's rioting. Firemen worked throughout the night to
extinguish fires left by the rioters.
   At Bab-El-Oued, where the riots began Tuesday night, and at El
Biar, police squads equipped with water cannon, armored cars and
police dogs stood ready, particularly near the big public schools.
   Witnesses said different groups of rioters seemed to aim at
different targets. Groups of youngsters began the rioting with
calls against the high cost of living. They were followed by older
rioters who chanted Islamic slogans and seemed to aim at foreign
and private businesses.
   Both groups were swept away by vandals dissembling and burning
furniture, equipment, computers and files, and looting shops.
   Bendjedid, facing the most serious challenge since he came to
power 10 years ago, warned Wednesday that he would ``intervene with
all vigor'' against any further rioting.

<DATELINE>NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist leadership of the
northern province of Vojvodina said today it will resign. The
announcement came after 50,000 people rallied to demand the ouster
of the politicians in a deepening economic crisis.
   Milovan Sogorov, president of the Communist Party Central
Committee of Vojvodina, made the announcement in Belgrade at an
emergency session of the Communist Party of Serbia, which controls
the autonomous northern province, the official Tanjug news agency
reported.
   The Central Committee was to implement the resignations at an
emergency meeting this evening in this provincial capital, about 40
miles north of Belgrade, state television reported.
   The resignation could pave the way for wholesale changes in the
national Communist Party leadership and in the parties of
Yugoslavia's six constituent republics.
   Angry crowds in Novi Sad chanted ``We want resignations!'' as
they gathered in front of the Communist Party Central Committee
headquarters.
   The state news agency Tanjug estimated the crowds at 100,000,
but an Associated Press reporter at the scene estimated about
50,000 people were on the streets at midafternoon.
   The protesters tried to force their way into the party
headquarters, but cordons of police, including a riot unit, blocked
their way.
   The crowds then moved to a larger square. Loudspeakers broadcast
shouted slogans about Yugoslavia's growing problems, which includes
217 percent inflation, a 15 percent unemployment rate and a $21
billion foreign debt.
   The flag-waving demonstrators chanted ``Police go away!'' ``We
are going to smash windows!'' and ``We want freedom!'' and demanded
the immediate resignation of the provincial Communist leadership,
according to the witnesses.
   Communist officials who spoke were booed and jeered by the
crowd, and television showed one hit with a bottle.
   Most factories and businesses in the city remained closed.
   The Serbian Communist Party issued a statement after its
emergency meeting saying the political situation in Vojvodina was
deteriorating rapidly, according to Tanjug.
   ``The Vojvodina leadership has been deaf to the demands of the
working class and other citizens,'' the statement said, adding, ``a
serious split has occurred between the Vojvodina leadership and the
people.''
   The demonstrations in Novi Sad began about noon Wednesday and
continued into the night.
   Protesters also chanted in favor of Serbian Communist Party
leader Slobodan Milosevic, who is demanding that the republic of
Serbia be given stronger central authority over Vojvodina and
Kosovo, a second autonomous region under Serbia. Serbs claim ethnic
Albanians, who form a majority of the population of Kosovo, are
forcing them out of the southern province.
   The protests in Vojvodina began just after about 5,000 workers
marched on the federal Parliament in Belgrade on Wednesday to voice
their anger over the economic situation.
   In central Serbia, about 140,000 Serbs participated in two other
rallies Wednesday to press demands for greater Serbian control over
Kosovo and Vojvodina.
   The Novi Sad protesters, who support Milosevic's position, were
spurred by a decision taken by the Central Committe of Vojvodina to
reprimand two members who supported his views at an earlier rally,
Tanjug said. The head of Yugoslavia's Communist Party, Stipe Suvar,
said Tuesday that the party's 162-member Central Committee probably
will vote Oct. 17 for a shake-up in the leadership of the ruling
Politburo.
   Yugoslavia is facing its worst economic and political crisis
since World War II, and criticism of the communist leaders is
mounting for their failures to resolve the economic problems and to
defuse tension between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush today proposed
doubling the national budget for prison construction and developing
a Cabinet-level program to combat street gangs.
   Bush's stuck to the text of his tough-on-crime speech before
Texas supporters and made no mention of running mate Dan Quayle's
debate Wednesday night with Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen.
   But later, while jogging at a quarter-mile track with students
at Texas Christian University, the vice president said he felt ``as
good as I did last night, which is very, very good.''
   Bush said Quayle ``answered the questions, he was knowledgeable,
he did an outstanding job and the American people know it, and
nobody's going to be able to _ even our spin merchants or the
Dukakis spin merchants _ can't change the facts.''
   Immediately after the nationally broadcast, 90-minute debate in
Omaha, Neb., the GOP nominee congratulated Quayle for ``a superb
job.''
   Speaking to a gathering of Texas law enforcement officials
sponsored by the Dallas-Fort Worth Crime Commission, Bush said he
would seek $250 million annually for the next four years ``to
incarcerate the hardened felons and rising number of drug
offenders.''
   He also said he would use assets seized from drug traffickers to
help finance new prison construction.
   Expanding on a proposal that he unveiled Wednesday, Bush that as
president he would create a unit within the Justice Department's
criminal division that would be devoted solely to mobilizing
government resources in a battle against violence-prone street
gangs.
   Bush adviser Debrah Steelman said the proposal would cost about
$50 million and would involve ``administrative efforts to
coordinate and fully utilize existing resources at the federal,
state and local levels.''
   Bush said he believes in rehabilitation to some extent,
especially for first-time offenders.
   ``But let's face it, some criminals are just plain bad. They're
not going to be rehabilitated. They're not going to reform,'' he
said.
   ``You're not going to solve the crime problem as some would by
talking tough while pursuing the same failed policies of liberal
leniency,'' Bush said.
   He accused Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis of having a
``liberal sense'' that counters the ``common sense'' that the death
penalty is a deterrent.
   ``I say that our society simply cannot afford any more liberal
experimentation with crime,'' he said.
   Bush called again for converting obsolete military bases into
prisons and for 100 new special agents to expand the government's
repeat-offender program for handling those who commit repeated
crimes.
   Bush said that white-collar criminals should not be given
special treatment. ``We should throw the book at them,'' he said.
   After the Quayle-Bentsen debate, Bush summoned reporters and
camera crews to his hotel to say that his running mate ``came
through with flying colors'' under tremendous pressure. ``Now
people can see what I've seen all along,'' he said.
   ``This guy did a superb job,'' he added. ``I couldn't be
happier.''
   From Fort Worth, the vice president headed to Midland, Texas,
and Little Rock, Ark.
   Prior to the debate, the vice president invited reporters to
watch the first question with him, and Bush declared his running
mate's response a ``home run.''
   ``He's doing good, good opening, strong opening, right out of
the ball park, the Canseco of American politics,'' Bush told
reporters, referring to Oakland A's baseball player Jose Canseco.
``He hit it the first answer, home run.,''
   Asked if the question to Quayle _ a Republican senator from
Indiana _ on criticisms of his qualifications was a fair one, Bush
replied: ``Everything's fair in this business. ... I'd like to get
a slow ball like that in the first one. It's easy.''
   Bush's chief of staff Craig Fuller said that while viewing the
debate in his hotel suite the GOP nominee cheered on Quayle with
such comments as ``he's doing a fantastic job.''
   After the debate, Bush called Quayle and told him it was ``a
10-strike,'' Fuller said. Bush also called President Reagan to
express his delight.
   Bush then told reporters that the American people saw Quayle
``in form, in control, answering substantive questions in a
substantive way and strong.''
   Asked about Bentsen's performance, Bush said, ``I'm not going to
criticize the other guy.''
   Earlier in the day, Bush unveiled a $3.9 billion ``Invest in Our
Children'' package that encompassed educational, health, anti-gang
and anti-toxic proposals that Bush said would combine to improve
educational opportunity for children.
   The 32-page plan included some previously announced Bush
proposals, including a tax credit for child care, and a provision
aimed at the poor calling for Medicaid coverage for pregnant women
and infants at up to 185 percent of the poverty level.
   Such individuals who do not have private sector insurance could
```buy in'' to the Medicaid system at an amount that does not
exceed 4 or 5 percent of their income, according to Bush adviser
Deborah Steelman.

<TEXT>
   A woman suffering from tuberculosis who
repeatedly refused treatment was arrested by authorities, who
suspect she spread the disease to family members and acquaintances.
   The woman, Margaret Allen, 29, was taken Wednesday to Montabello
Rehabilitation Center in Baltimore for treatment.
   Elin Gursky, director of epidemiology and disease control for
the Prince George's County health department, said Allen was
arrested by sheriff's deputies under a little-used provision of
Maryland law that requires public health officials to control the
spread of contagious diseases.
   Tuberculosis, which causes coughing, night sweats and profound
weight loss, can be cured but can cause death if not treated,
Gursky said.
   Health officials cannot force Allen to receive treatment for the
disease, but they can incarcerate her to prevent its spread, Gursky
said. Allen was described as being in a highly infectious stage of
the disease, and if she leaves the hospital, Gursky said, she can
be jailed.
   Health officials repeatedly tried to persuade Allen to be
treated for the disease and then obtained a court order in a civil
proceeding before seeking a criminal warrant for her arrest, Gursky
said. Several members of her family have tested positive for
tuberculosis, and are expected to receive treatment.
   ``I don't want people to think we go around arresting people who
have communicable diseases because we don't,'' Gursky said. ``This
was an extreme case.''
   Tuberculosis is caused by an airborne strain of bacteria that
can be transmitted by sharing a close space with an infected
person, she said.

   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen exuberantly pointed
today to polls suggesting he'd won his debate with Republican Dan
Quayle, while Quayle focused on running mate George Bush, declaring
him ``still way ahead'' in the presidential race.
   Bush did not mention the debate as he gave an anti-crime speech
today in Fort Worth, Texas. Afterward, when asked about Wednesday
night's encounter, he said Quayle ``did an outstanding job and the
American people know it.''
   The Democratic standardbearer, Michael Dukakis, pronounced the
debate ``a real plus for us.'' He said today that Quayle was
``programmed beyond belief'' while Bentsen was ``knowledgeable and
relaxed.''
   Bentsen, heading to Texas where he was to join Dukakis, noted
that a flash ABC News poll had found viewers declaring him the
winner, by 51 percent to 27 percent; that the same survey had shown
a gain of three percentage points for Dukakis in the presidential
race, putting him and Bush in a virtual tie, and that a panel of
debate judges who scored the debate for The Associated Press had
unanimously said Bentsen won.
   ``Gee, those polls were great, weren't they. ... I was just
delighted,'' he said.
   Quayle, who spoke to reporters as he left a rally at his hotel
in Omaha, said he was unconcerned about the polling. ``George Bush
is going to win the election. He's still way ahead in the polls,''
Quayle said.
   In Washington, President Reagan accused Bentsen of having taken
``a cheap shot'' against Quayle when Bentsen retorted during the
debate that ``you're no Jack Kennedy'' after Quayle compared his
own experience with that of the late President John F. Kennedy.
   Bentsen, asked today about that exchange in the debate, said,
``What happened there was Quayle kept comparing himself to Kennedy,
and he overreached himself and I got fed up with it.''
   The Texas senator said Kennedy was a war hero and had run a
nationwide campaign before being nominated for the presidency. He
said of Quayle, ``Sure, as friend of Jack Kennedy I deeply resented
his trying to put Kennedy's mantle over himself when he didn't have
a record that compared with Kennedy.''
   Democrats hoped the debate had dramatized their contention that
Quayle was too inexperienced to step into the presidency on a
moment's notice.
   In a 90-minute meeting where neither candidate made any big
mistakes, the most electric moment came when the boyish-looking,
41-year-old Quayle was defending his qualifications and said he had
as much experience as Kennedy had had when he sought the
presidency. It was a comparison he has made often.
   Bentsen shot back, ``Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew
Jack Kennedy, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no
Jack Kennedy.''
   With an icy stare, Quayle interrupted to say, ``That was really
uncalled for, senator.'' Bentsen replied, ``You are the one that
was making the comparison, senator ... and I'm the one who knew him
well.''
   
   After the debate, Dukakis seized on the question of competence,
telling a Boston rally, ``The most important qualification for the
vice president is that he's ready at a moment's notice to assume
the presidency of the United States. Tonight Lloyd Bentsen
demonstrated that he was the only one on that stage who's ready.''
   In Fort Worth, Texas, Vice President Bush said Quayle hit a
``home run'' right from the start of the debate and wasn't fazed by
the questions about his fitness.
   Bush said that Quayle ``under tremendous pressure ... came
through with flying colors. Now people can see what I've seen all
along.''
   With just 33 days remaining before the election, Bentsen was
teaming up with Dukakis today at a rally in Longview, Texas. Quayle
was heading for stops in Missouri, Florida and Tenneesse, while
Bush campaigned separately in Texas and Arkansas.
   The third and final debate of the campaign will be held late
next week in Los Angeles when Dukakis and Bush square off for the
second, and last, time.
   In a presidential race that is virtually a tossup at this point,
polls indicate that Quayle is costing Bush support, with many
voters uneasy about his readiness for high office.
   It was the first question put to Quayle on Wednesday night, and
he replied, ``I have more experience than others that have sought
the office of vice president.'' He said that on national security
and arms control, education and jobs and the deficit, ``I have more
experience than does the governor of Massachusetts.''
   The 67-year-old Bentsen was never challenged on his
qualifications, but he pointed out that he had served in combat,
was a businessman and a farmer as well as a senator.
   ``What we are looking at today is trying to judge once again the
breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this
kind of a task,'' Bentsen said.
   Bentsen accused the Republicans of attempting to slash Social
Security and said Quayle voted eight times to cut benefits. Quayle
accused him of distorting the record and said the Democrats were
trying ``to scare the older people of this country.''
   Bentsen said the Reagan administration had appointed
environmental officials who were the equivalent of Bonnie and
Clyde. Quayle said Dukakis had allowed a major environmental
problem to fester in Boston Harbor.
   Bentsen assailed Quayle on his record on veterans' issues. He
said his rival had sponsored legislation to tax the combat pay and
disability pay for ``people who are lying in the hospital.'' Quayle
did not reply to the charge.
   Quayle criticized Bentsen, the chairman of the tax-writing
Senate Finance Committee, for setting up a breakfast club for
lobbyists willing to pay $10,000 in campaign contributions. ``I'm
sure they weren't paying to have cornflakes,'' Quayle said.
   Bentsen said there was nothing illegal in what he did, but said
the breakfast club was a ``doozy'' of a mistake. He said Quayle has
collected ``over a quarter of a million dollars'' in honoraria,
much of it from special interest groups, and that Quayle could
spend the money on golf club dues if he wants.
   An ABC News poll conducted immediately after the debate found
Bentsen the winner over Quayle, 51 percent to 27 percent. The 637
voters polled favored Bush over Dukakis by a margin of 50 percent
to 45 percent before the debate, and by a margin of 50 percent to
48 afterward. The margin of error was 4.5 percent.
   All six debate judges who scored the contest for The Associated
Press picked Bentsen as the winner by an overall margin of 148-125.
A perfect score was 180.

   President Reagan today accused Democrat LLoyd
Bentsen of ``a cheap shot ... unbecoming a senator of the United
States'' for criticizing Republican Dan Quayle for comparing
himself with John F. Kennedy.
   Reagan, posing for pictures with President Moussa Traore of
Mali, was asked by a reporter whether Quayle would be damaged by
being compared with the late president.
   ``No, I think that remark was a cheap shot and unbecoming a
senator of the United States,'' the president said.
   Another reporter asked if Quayle hadn't ``led with his chin'' in
comparing himself with Kennedy during his vice presidential debate
with Bentsen in Omaha, Neb., on Wednesday.
   ``No, the only comparison he was making was that he is being
attacked, I think unfairly, on the basis of his age and his
experience in government, and he was pointing out that John
Kennedy, who sought the highest office and won it, had actually
less experience in government than he has, and they were the same
age,'' Reagan replied.
   As White House aides ushered reporters out of the Oval Office,
Reagan called them back and said he did not believe that Quayle was
``trying in any way to downgrade Sen. Kennedy.''
   Quayle, 41, sparked one of the sharpest exchanges of the debate
when he said he had as much government experience as Kennedy, then
a senator from Massachusetts, when Kennedy ran for president in
1960.
   Bentsen, 67, replied, ``I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack
Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack
Kennedy.''
   Quayle shot back, ``That was really uncalled for, senator.''
Bentsen replied that it was Quayle who had made the comparison in
the first place.

   A Tuscaloosa police officer testified
today that a man accused of taking 110 people hostage at a private
school was armed with a rifle every time he saw him through the
front door of the building.
   James L. Harvey, the defendant who is representing himself at
his trial on kidnapping charges, asked Capt. Shirley Fields whether
he saw Harvey ever point the weapon at children inside West End
Christian School at Tuscaloosa.
   ``Not directly at them, but you had it ready,'' Fields said.
   The defendant then asked him whether he thought Harvey's life
might have been in danger and whether that could have been the
reason he had the weapon. Fields said that could have been the case.
   In his opening statement to the jury Wednesday, Harvey, 43,
defended his takeover of the school on Feb. 2 by saying the U.S.
Constitution gives him the right to bear arms.
   ``I didn't kidnap anybody,'' the unemployed Tuscaloosa resident
told jurors. ``I went there to exercise my constitutional rights.
The government is doing things to destroy the future of our
country.''
   Harvey has said he took over the school to call attention to the
homeless and hungry in America. His trial was moved to Huntsville
because of publicity in Tuscaloosa.
   He began his defense after District Attorney Charles Freeman
told the jury that ``children and teachers were in stark, cold
terror for endless hours'' during the incident.
   The 110 counts involve 104 students, five teachers and John
Rhodes Jr., a man Harvey is accused of duping into helping seize
the school. Rhodes was initially charged in the takeover, but
authorities later said he was an unwilling participant.
   All the students, teachers and Rhodes, plus officers and the
school's headmaster, Dan Carden, are among the 137 people
subpoenaed to testify at the trial, which Circuit Judge John M.
Karrh said probably will last from five to seven days.
   Also summoned was Gov. Guy Hunt, who is to testify Friday about
a bogus pardon he videotaped that led Harvey to surrender 12 hours
after he entered the elementary school, armed with a high-caliber
rifle, two loaded automatic pistols and 2,000 rounds of ammunition,
plus two unloaded guns he handed to Rhodes as they entered the
school.
   ``I have a constitutional right to bear arms,'' Harvey said. ``I
went there to prove my right to bear arms. ... I didn't mean to
hurt anyone.''
   In a rambling discourse, he told the jury that politicians don't
tell the truth, that people are poisoning water and air, that
``we're selling our children's futures'' with the national debt.
   During the siege, he said, he told officers who tried to
dissuade him that ``this is not a criminal act. It is a political
act.''
   In fact, Harvey said, because the school was surrounded by
officers, ``I felt like a hostage. It could have ended in five
hours. They put me through psychological warfare.''
   Assistant prosecutor Thomas Smith told jurors that a first-grade
class went from 8:30 a.m., when Harvey entered the school, until
1:46 p.m. ``with no food, no restroom, no water, no nothing.''
   During the siege, Smith said, Harvey ``always had children
around him so he wouldn't get shot. He was using them as shields as
well as hostages. ... He is certainly guilty of all counts of
kidnapping.''
   If convicted on all counts, Harvey could be sentenced to more
than 10,000 years in prison.

   The Defense Department has formally changed
its plans for the first phase of a Star Wars anti-missile defensive
system, slashing the cost estimate for a rudimentary system from
$115 billion to $69 billion, the Pentagon announced today.
   ``This is a startling change,'' top Pentagon officials told a
joint hearing of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees.
   But the lowered cost is the result of changes in the program,
said Robert Costello, undersecretary of defense for acquisition;
Air Force Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, director of the Star Wars
program; and Gen. Robert Herres, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff.
   The Pentagon's Defense Acquisition Board had completed an annual
review of the program on Tuesday and approved a series of
restructuring moves, they told the panels.
   The changes are designed to keep the research moving forward
while addressing concerns that it would cost too much to begin
deploying a system on the ground and in space, the Pentagon said.
   The restructuring ``absolutely does not'' mean the
administration is pulling back from its original goal of developing
a high-tech defensive system that could shield the United States
from nuclear missiles, the Pentagon added.
   The program, as now modified, will still ``continue to emphasize
research on space defense; to provide for early deployment of
space-based sensor systems; to maintain the option to develop a
limited protection system, given a future national decision and the
funding to do so, and to provide for a balance between near- and
longer-term weapons technology programs,'' the statement said.
   The lowered projections surprised some legislators. Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate panel, said he viewed the
numbers with ``some skepticism.''
   Nunn said costs on other weapons have dropped while the weapons
were on the drawing boards, but then rose once the programs entered
the construction phase.
   Abrahamson denied that the program's goals have changed and a
defense of U.S. population centers is still the aim.
   ``The goals have not changed,'' he told Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., in answer to a question.
   The Star Wars program, known formally as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, is an effort to develop lasers and other exotic weapons
that could be deployed in space and on the ground to automatically
shoot down Soviet nuclear missiles. Congress has repeatedly refused
in recent years to fund the program at the pace sought by President
Reagan, but nonetheless has allowed the research to continue.
   Last June, when it became clear Congress was going to slash more
than $700 million from the president's fiscal 1989 request of $4.9
billion, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci ordered the entire
program restructured. It was those modifications, in turn, which
were reviewed Tuesday by the Defense Acquisition Board, the
Pentagon's highest level weapons review panel.
   According to Tuesday's announcement, the huge reduction in the
estimated cost of a first-phase system was achieved primarily by
scaling back plans for space-based interceptor rockets _ known as
SBI's.
   The Pentagon now believes it can develop a more capable
``seeker'' guidance unit for the rocket, improving its chances of
hitting a target and thus reducing the number that would have to be
fired in a war.
   ``This, together with shifting more of the burden to the
lower-cost ... (ground-based rocket interceptors) _ which was
increased in inventory by about 70 percent _ enabled us to cut the
size of the SBI constellation in half,'' the Pentagon said.
   The department declined to say specifically how many SBI
interceptors it planned to put in space for the modified phase one
system, saying the number was classified.
   ``But there would be fewer than 200 carrier vehicles, with
several SBI's aboard each carrier,'' the Pentagon said.
   The department said it also had achieved the cost savings by
reducing the sophistication of a planned surveillance and tracking
satellite system.
   The various modifications will not have any effect on estimates
that it will take several years yet for researchers to determine
even that a phase one system is workable, the Pentagon said.
   ``The decision to deploy a strategic defense system will be made
by future national leaders in the early to mid 1990's, contingent
upon adequate funding levels,'' the Pentagon said.

<HEAD>Chinese-Soviet Summit Planned Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will hold a summit
with Chinese leaders early next year, a Kremlin diplomat said today.
   Igor A. Rogachev, a deputy foreign minister who is the Soviets'
point man in contacts with the Chinese, was asked at a news
conference whether a Soviet-Chinese summit will follow a meeting
this year between the two countries' foreign ministers.
   He also was asked whether the summit would occur in the first
half of next year, as news reports from Shanghai have indicated.
   ``My sense is that one might be in a position to suggest that
both would be the case,'' Rogachev replied.
   Relations have been strained between the two communist giants
since the 1960s, and the last Chinese summit was held in 1959
between Nikita S. Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung.
   Gorbachev, who is also the Soviet Communist Party chief, has
made several overtures to China to remove obstacles to improving
relations. He has ordered a pullout of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan, reduced Soviet troops on the border with China, and
agreed in August to the first direct talks with the Chinese about
the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Quichen met with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in New York last month, and Quian
is to travel to Moscow later this year. No date has been set.
   Rogachev said the Cambodia conflict, in which the Soviet Union
supports Vietnam's occupation, will be high on the agenda for the
Moscow talks.
   Rogachev, who represented the Kremlin in the talks with the
Chinese on Cambodia, did not say whether Gorbachev would travel to
Beijing or whether Chinese leaders would come to Moscow.
   Gorbachev renewed the idea of a summit with China in a speech in
the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk Sept. 16.

   If you thought the Quayle-Bentsen debate was
heated, you should have seen the MacLaine-Letterman one the night
before.
   One day before the vice presidential candidates sparred on
network television Wednesday, actress Shirley MacLaine appeared on
NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman,'' ostensibly to plug her
new film, ``Madame Sousatzka.''
   But the host, to her annoyance, preferred to discuss MacLaine's
tales of exotic past lives, which she has written about in two
books.
   ``I already said I don't think we can get into it and you keep
harping on it. Maybe Cher was right, maybe you are an
(expletive),'' MacLaine said. Network censors bleeped the remark.
   ``Why did you call me that?'' asked Letterman.
   ``I thought it was a funny remark,'' answered MacLaine.
   ``Calling me an (expletive)?'' wondered Letterman.
   The comedian asked later: ``Are you really upset or are you
pretending?''
   ``You can't tell?'' responded MacLaine.
   ``I've never met you,'' said Letterman.
   ``You've met me. You were running around these dressing rooms at
NBC trying to get me to go on your show,'' MacLaine said.
   And:
   ``Is there anything you want to talk about?'' asked he.
   ``You're the interviewer, you tell me, you've wanted me here for
three years,'' answered she.
   ``And I think we'll probably wait another three,'' said the host.
   Letterman producer Robert Morton said he didn't think anyone
went away mad. ``It was good TV, and we would consider her as a
possible guest on the show in the future,'' he told the Daily News.
   And in the blue corner? ``Maybe we were irascible lovers in a
past life,'' suggested MacLaine through a spokesman.

   When police responded to a call at an apartment

   The Rome newspaper Il Messaggero reported that three policemen
went into the pool Wednesday and tried to catch the penquin.
Finally, a policewoman managed to coax the bird into being handled,
the report said.
   The penguin was taken to the Rome zoo until its owner could be

   A flatbed trailer broke loose from a truck
and crashed head-on into a bus, killing 28 people and injuring 21,
an official said Thursday.
   Taha el-Saafan, chief prosecutor in this town north of Cairo,
said all the casualties were on the bus and that the victims ranged
in age from 5 to 40. The bus driver was among the dead, he said.
   The collision occurred Wednesday on a two-lane rural road.
   The public bus was en route from Kafr el-Sheikh, 95 miles north
of Cairo, to Baltim, a summer resort about 30 miles away, el-Saafan
said.
   As the truck approached from the opposite direction, he said,
its trailer became detached.
   He said the trailer was traveling at about 55 mph when it
barreled into the bus.
   He said the truck driver, Saad Aly, 29, surrendered to police
and was under investigation on a number of charges, including
driving an unsafe vehicle.

   More than 100 people were reported
killed Thursday in flooding that has ravaged thousands of Pakistani
villages, and another 59 people were feared drowned after four
rescue boats sank.
   Police said 19 people were believed killed Wednesday when three
army boats shuttling people from their flooded homes sank. On
Tuesday, another rescue boat sank and 40 people were believed to
have drowned, officials said.
   In addition, another 104 people are known to have drowned in the
flooding, which began two weeks ago. Police said more than 100
people are missing.
   According to government figures, the flooding has affected more
than 3 million people and 4,000 villages, mainly in the eastern
province of Punjab.
   The flooding began after heavy rains sent the Sutlej, Ravi and
Chenab rivers over their banks.
   Medical officials near the ancient Punjab capital of Lahore have
warned of an epidemic of skin diseases in the affected areas
because of the lack of sanitation.
   Relief centers have sprung up throughout the province providing
food and clean drinking water. Officials said thousands have been
vaccinated against typhoid and cholera.

   A 25-year-old woman was charged with
infanticide after admitting she placed each of her four children in
plastic bags when they were babies and threw them in the garbage.
   Sylvie Coulon, charged Wednesday by Investigating Magistrate
Isabelle Parmentier, said she committed the crimes because she was
``alone and broke.''
   She said she gave birth in 1984, 1985, 1986 and early in 1988.
She explained her weight changes to colleagues and neighbors by
simply saying that she was eating too much. Authorities described
Ms. Coulon as a child-care worker.
   An anonymous phone call in June tipped police, who began
questioning neighbors. On Monday, Miss Coulon was called in for
questioning, police said.
   She said she gave birth four times and disposed of each infant,
police said. According to police, she said she was once again
pregnant but this time wanted to keep the child.

   Vietnamese Siamese twins were reported doing well
Thursday after being separated in a 14-hour operation.
   A 72-member medical team operated on the 7-year-old twins, Viet
and Duc, at Tu Du Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City on Tuesday.
   Viet and Duc were ``in very good condition,'' said Yoshiaki
Nemoto, spokesman for the Japanese Red Cross, which provided most
of the medical equipment for the operation. The twins' vital
readings were stable, Nemoto said.
   Kyodo News Service quoted a Vietnamese doctor in Ho Chi Minh
City as saying that the twins were given tranquilizers and pain
killers and were asleep most of time. But he said it would take
about a week to judge the success of the operation, Kyodo said.
   The twins were joined at the pelvis and shared genitals and a
single pair of legs, one bowel, an anus, a bladder, and a pair of
kidneys.
   Each twin received one leg, while the organs went to Duc, the
more healthy of the two, Japanese news media reported. Viet has
been comatose since May 1986.
   Vietnamese officials have said the number of Siamese twins in
their country rose after American use of defoliants known to
produce birth defects during the Vietnam War, including in the
central highlands where Viet and Duc were born in February 1981.

<TEXT>
   Riot police arrested a group of
radical students who stormed a government office with iron pipes
and firebombs and shouted anti-American and anti-government slogans.
   At least two students were reported seriously injured when
police broke into the office to stop the two-hour protest.
   Police said 23 students from eight universities in Seoul
overpowered security guards and charged into Parliamentary Hall, a
legislative office building near the National Assembly building.
All were arrested.
   The students demanded immediate punishment of former President
Chun Doo-hwan, who has been under investigation for alleged
corruption and brutality.
   The students broke windows and unfolded a giant placard that
read ``Drive out Yankees'' and ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan and his
wife.''
   The radicals locked themselves inside the fourth-floor office of
Chung Ho-yong, a senior member of the governing Democratic Justice
Party, and tossed out papers, chairs and a portrait of President
Roh Tae-woo. Chung was not in the office.
   Dissidents charge that Chung, a former army general, played a
role in supressing a 1980 uprising in the southern city of Kwangju
in which nearly 200 people were killed.
   Hundreds of riot police backed by firetrucks surrounded the
building and spread mattresses on the ground to prevent suicide
attempts by students who threatened to burn the office or jump from
windows if police intervened.
   One student cut his stomach with a razor when about 100 police
officers broke through the office door to end the seizure,
according to witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Another protester jumped from the window and was taken to the
hospital, where he was reported in stable condition. One of Chung's
aides and several policemen were also hurt, the South Korean news
agency Yonhap said.
   Leaflets scattered by the students criticized the United States,
which the dissidents say supports the division of the Korean
Peninsula. The students are demanding the withdrawal of about
42,000 American troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual
defense pact.
   Also Thursday, about 500 students at Seoul's Dongkuk University
battled riot police with firebombs and rocks after an
anti-government rally.

   North Korea on Thursday continued its verbal
attacks on the Olympic Games in Seoul, calling them ``dictatorial''
and an excuse for suppression of popular protest.
   The government in Pyongyang also accused the United States of
using the Olympics to keep the Korean Peninsula divided. The Games,
which began Sept. 17, ended Sunday.
   ``Facts vividly show how strongly the divisive Olympics, the
dictatorial Olympics, induced by the U.S. imperialists and their
stooges into Seoul, was rejected by the people,'' the
government-run Korean Central News Agency said.
   The report was monitored in Tokyo.
   North Korea demanded to be a co-host at the Games. The
International Olympic Committee said the Games are given to a
single city and cannot be shared.
   North Korea has been charging for months that South Korea and
the United States were scheming to use the Olympics to permanently
divide the Korean Peninsula, split into capitalist South and
communist North since 1945.
   ``The U.S. imperialists' `two Koreas' plot has become more
pronounced nowadays,'' the Minju Chosun, a state-run newspaper,
said last week.
   ``It is proved by the fact that they ... are employing
despicable means to take this opportunity to create an atmosphere
for creating `two Koreas.' ''
   South Korean officials had said they believed North Korea would
stage terrorist attacks on the South to disrupt the Games and set
up tight security, but no incidents occurred.
   The U.S. Navy conducted exercises near the peninsula to prevent
terrorist attacks.
   The North Korean news agency branded the tight security as
``suppression.''
   ``The fascist clique are intensifying suppression, calling
people's protests against the dictatorial Olympics a `dangerous
act,' '' the agency said. ``Subsequently, Seoul is now in a more
horrible atmosphere.''
   The newspaper Rodong Sinmun, the official organ of the Workers
Party of Korea, said the same day that ``the U.S. imperialists, on
the plea of `Olympic safety,' sent carrier flotillas and many other
aggression forces to and around South Korea to resort to a nuclear
blackmail.''
   Radical students in Seoul, opposed to what they see as U.S.
support for an unpopular government, had threatened to disrupt the
Games' last event, the men's marathon, and there was visible
security in place.
   ``The marathon, which is usually held amid enthusiastic cheers
of crowds, was held in Seoul in a horrifying atmosphere, the police
lining the route instead of cheering crowds,'' the news agency said.
   ``It was not a race but a torturous experience for the
marathoners who had to run through the narrow corridor of police
walls.''

<HEAD>Drug Company Says Sprinter's Doctor Bought Steroids</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A spokesman for a drug company said Ben Johnson's
personal physician purchased the same anabolic steroid that was
found in the sprinter's urine after he won the 100-meter dash at
the Olympics.
   The physician, Dr. George Mario Astaphan, has told some media
organizations that he has never given stanozolol to any of his
patients. He said that includes Johnson, who was stripped of his
gold medal after he tested positive for the drug at the Games in
Seoul, South Korea, last month.
   But in an interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corp. last week,
Astaphan said he has prescribed some anabolic steroids to some
patients. He did not say what type of steroid. Astaphan practices
on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts.
   Joe Kiefer, spokesman for Sterling Research Ltd., said on
Wednesday: ``We have made a search of our sales records and it
confirms that we have sold stanozolol to Dr. Astaphan.''
   Records of sales from the drug company have been turned over to
the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons to help in its
investigation of Astaphan's medical practice.
   Sterling, a U.S.-owned company based in Toronto, is the only
manufacturer and distributor of stanozolol in North America.
   Keifer would not say how many times Astaphan bought the steroid,
which is banned by the International Olympic Committee, or the
quantity of the drug bought each time.
   In addition to the college's investigation into the affair, the
federal government has announced one of its own.
   Ontario Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Charles Dubin was
named Wednesday to head a wide-ranging judicial inquiry into drug
abuse in Canadian sports. Johnson's case will be the focus of the
probe.
   In a statement Tuesday, Johnson said he has never knowingly
taken illegal drugs.

   Chileans rejected President Augusto
Pinochet's bid to extend his 15-year rule in a referendum that
cleared the way for democratic elections. The military government
conceded defeat today.
   The entire 16-member Cabinet submitted their resignations early
today, Labor Minister Alfonso Marquez de la Plata told reporters.
He also said the assistant ministry officials resigned. He gave no
further details.
   Gen. Pinochet, the army commander, gave no statement on the
results of Wednesday's balloting, and it was not known whether he
would accept the resignations or shuffle his Cabinet.
   Thousands of celebrating students marched through Santiago
today, and people in downtown buildings showered streets with
confetti.
   With 99.6 percent of the vote counted, 54.7 percent rejected
Pinochet and 43 percent voted for him in the ``yes'' or ``no''
referendum, the Interior Ministry said at midday.
   More than 7.2 million of Chile's 7.4 million registered voters
cast the first presidential ballots in 18 years, the ministry said.
Some waited in lines up to a mile long.
   ``The country delivered its mandate ... (and is) on the way to a
transition to an authentic democracy,'' Patricio Aylwin, leader of
a 16-party opposition coalition, told cheering supporters today.
   Under the constitution, Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody
1973 coup, remains in power until 1990. If he had won the
referendum, he would have served until 1997.
   Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez pledged to respect the
results of Wednesday's balloting but also to enforce the 1980
constitution, which the political opposition wants changed.
   Police reported few incidents of violence, and traffic was
normal later in the morning.
   Leaders of a 16-party opposition coalition promised to pursue
national unity as they seek a speedy return to democratic
government.
   Fernandez; Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian
Democratic Party; and Roman Catholic Cardinal Francisco Fresno
hailed the peaceful reaction a sign of Chileans' maturity and civic
responsibility. Patricio Hales, Communist Party spokesman, said the
party took measures to keep people quiet ``and prevent disorders
that could have been used by the government as a pretext for
repression.''
   Fernandez formally conceded defeat early today after an
emergency meeting with Pinochet, the four-man military junta that
serves as a legislature, and the 15-member Cabinet.
   ``We abide by the results already known to the people,''
Fernandez said, reading from a text.
   His expression grave, he added that the government ``reiterates
its unbreakable resolve to comply with, and have others comply
with, the constitution and laws.''
   The opposition has said it will pursue negotiations with the
armed forces on changing the constitution, pushed through by
Pinochet in 1980.
   The document lays out a schedule for a return to democracy,
including a special provision for Wednesday's referendum. In case
of a ``no'' majority, it called for competitive presidential
elections to be held in December 1989, with the winner assuming
power in March 1990.
   Pinochet remains leader until then.
   The constitution also calls for elections in 1990 for a
congress, disbanded when Pinochet seized power in a September 1973
coup that ousted President Salvador Allende, a Marxist who won the
last presidential election in 1970.
   Opposition leaders want the presidential ballot moved up. They
also want to eliminate provisions in the constitution that make
congress virtually powerless to amend it and that give the armed
forces both autonomy and supervisory role in national policy-making.
   Aylwin said in a victory speech: ``We reiterate our proposal to
reach agreement with the armed forces on the terms of an
institutional political change that would result in free elections
quickly, and in a congress totally and freely elected.''
   The military made no immediate comment on the proposal but has
rejected such calls before.
   There were no significant reports of fraud during the voting,
but after polls closed scattered violence was reported by
authorities, including the burning of a public bus by
anti-government protesters.
   In the often combative southern slum of La Victoria, hundreds
sat outside, following the returns by radio, waving flags and
setting off firecrackers. Soldiers did not intervene.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Concludes Brawley Made Up Story</HEAD>

   The grand jury in the Tawana Brawley
case concluded in a report issued today that the black teen-ager
apparently concocted her story of abduction and rape by a gang of
white men.
   The 170-page report said there was ``no evidence that any sexual
assault occurred,'' and it suggested that the girl herself was
responsible for the feces-smeared condition in which she was found
after a four-day disappearance.
   The seven-month investigation went on without the cooperation of
the 16-year-old Miss Brawley or her family, who with their advisers
accused authorities of engaging in a racially motivated cover-up.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams said he has filed ethics
complaints against Miss Brawley's lawyers, Alton Maddox Jr. and C.
Vernon Mason, for making ``every effort to prevent the criminal
justice system from uncovering the truth of what happened.''
   Abrams accused the advisers of ``opportunism and hucksterism in
presenting their personal agenda'' and added: ``Perhaps the
greatest disservice done by the Brawley advisers is the reckless
manner in which they jeopardized the rights of future victims of
racial assaults.''
   Miss Brawley's advisers bitterly attacked the report.
   ``What should we expect from 21 whites from Dutchess County?''
Mason said on New York City radio station WLIB, referring to 21
whites on the panel of 23. ``It is clear they never intended to
arrest and prosecute those people who did this to Tawana Brawley.''
   Another adviser, the Rev. Al Sharpton, said Abrams is ``not
after people who rape black girls. ... They want to stop anybody
who will stand up for the rights of black people in this country.''
   The grand jury heard testimony from more than 180 witnesses and
received more than 250 exhibits of evidence on the racially charged
case.
   Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28, seemingly dazed, outside an
apartment that had recently been vacated by her family in
Wappingers Falls, 75 miles north of New York City. Her body was
smeared with feces and scrawled with racial slurs in charcoal.
   She claimed she had been held captive for four days and raped by
the white men, and she implicated law enforcement officials in the
attack.
   ``There is nothing in regard to Tawana Brawley's appearance on
Nov. 28 that is inconsistent with this condition having been
self-inflicted,'' the grand jury said. It said she had spent some
of the four-day period at her old apartment.
   ``Although we have not found any evidence to substantiate her
allegations, we remain concerned about the welfare of this young
woman,'' the panel said.
   Abrams would not speculate on why Miss Brawley may have
concocted the story.
   However, The New York Times, which disclosed the grand jury's
findings last month, reported at the time that the panel had
evidence suggesting that she made up the story to avoid punishment
from her mother's boyfriend for late nights out.
   The newspaper said the grand jury also heard allegations that
Miss Brawley may have been involved with drugs or questionable
characters.
   It said the grand jury found the teen-ager misled doctors,
social workers, reporters and public officials with false and
fragmentary accounts of the alleged abduction.
   No charges were brought against Miss Brawley. The grand jury
said it found ``no legally sufficient evidence to charge any person
with a crime or to establish that a crime occurred.''
   A grand jury in New York is not permitted to criticize ordinary
citizens it does not indict.
   Abrams said the false allegations by Brawley led to ``an
enormous expenditure of money and time.''
   Miss Brawley's lawyers ``seriously impeded the investigation by
making false public statements, including accusing innocent persons
of assault, rape and murder. They told their clients to engage in
illegal conduct,'' said Abrams, who went on to detail 19 instances
of alleged false statements.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo has agreed to have the state shoulder the cost
of the investigation, which has probably topped $500,000, because
he feels ``the people of Dutchess County have already been hurt
enough, said spokesman Gary Fryer.
   The panel also found there was no evidence of a cover-up by law
enforcement officials.
   It specifically cleared Dutchess County Assistant Prosecutor
Steven Pagones and Harry Crist Jr., a police officer who committed
suicide shortly after Miss Brawley was found. Miss Brawley's
advisers had accused both of involvement.
   The grand jury issued recommendations to the Legislature for
legal reforms, including a proposal that would allow the relative
of a dead person to bring a defamation case when the individual is
falsely accused of a felony.
   State Supreme Court Justice Angelo J. Ingrassia released the
findings at the request of Abrams, who was named special prosecutor
in the case by Cuomo.
   Ingrassia praised the thoroughness of the grand jury and said
the panel reached its conclusions properly. ``Really, it was beyond
a reasonable doubt,'' he said.
   Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda, was sentenced to 30 days in jail
in June for defying a subpoena to testify, but she defied arrest by
living in a church.
   The grand jury subpoenaed Miss Brawley, but later rescinded its
vote when it was clear she would not cooperate, according to
published reports.
   The family recently moved to Virginia Beach, Va., but has since
left. Their whereabouts were not immediately known.

<TEXT>
   Four nuns critical of recent
modernizations such as television and videotaped movies in their
monastery have barricaded themselves in a wing because they fear
they will be ejected.
   The Roman Catholic nuns sealed themselves Tuesday morning in the
infirmary of the Monastery of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mt.
Carmel and remained there today.
   The nuns, members of the Order of the Discalced Carmelites, said
monastery officials told them four months ago they would have to
move because of sharp differences in the way the cloister should be
run. The order is a cloistered group devoted to daily prayer and
contemplation in solitude.
   However, Paterson Bishop Frank John Rodimer said today the women
would not be ejected.
   ``The sisters are not being evicted. The diocese will continue
to help these four sisters do what they agreed to do, to find a
monastery where they can live prayerfully and contemplatively,'' he
said.
   The nuns, ages 28 to 45, moved food and their belongings into
the infirmary, tied the door shut, and have vowed to stay there
until they receive word from the Vatican. Rodimer said the diocese
has received Vatican approval for its actions.
   Calls to the Vatican Embassy in Washington for comment were not
immediately returned.
   ``We entered the monastery for a particular life style, and what
these other, liberal nuns did is change these rules,'' Sister John,
one of the nuns, told The Record of Hackensack.
   None of the nuns could be reached for comment today; a reporter
left a note at the convent gate to be carried up to them.
   The nuns told the newspaper that Mother Teresa, the monastery's
prioress, began to modernize life at the monastery after her
arrival last year. They said she introduced television, videotaped
movies, music and socializing. This created a backlash among the
more orthodox members of the order, they said.
   ``It's unnecessary noise, constant interruptions, too much
hustle and bustle,'' Sister John said. ``This is an all-around
change, a change in the spirit of the monastery.''
   Mother Teresa Hewitt refused to comment today.

<TEXT>
   About 100 people protested outside a clinic today
in Atlanta's third day of anti-abortion demonstrations, and police
dragged away at least seven people for climbing barricades outside
the building.
   The protesters were arrested near the Feminist Women's Health
Center. Police asked them to walk to the vans, and when they
refused, they were dragged about 200 feet to the vehicles and taken
to jail.
   The rest of the protesters stood outside the barricades, singing
hymns.
   Meanwhile, protest leaders are claiming continued success in
their promised ``Siege of Atlanta,'' despite dwindling numbers at
nightly rallies and fewer demonstrations at daytime protests.
   On Tuesday, helmeted police officers stood guard at the Feminist
Women's Health Center as patients inside huddled and employees went
about their business and protesters outside shouted Bible verses.
   The clinic is one of seven targeted by Operation Rescue, the New
York-based group staging demonstrations here this week. The number
of demonstrators has dwindled since Tuesday, when 343 were arrested
on misdemeanor charges.
   Fourteen were arrested Wednesday, said City Solicitor Raines
Carter said.
   Three of them were charged with simple assault when a patient
they tried to bar from Feminist Women's Health Center stumbled and
fell.
   Protest leaders who dubbed this week's protests the ``Siege of
Atlanta'' said they have prevented abortions with their
demonstrations, which include attempting to blockade entrances.
   Clinic officials disputed that, and said aside from some
rescheduling of appointments, business has not been affected.
   But a 21-year-old patient from Rome, Ga., said she was horrified
by the severity of the protests as she arrived at the clinic
Wednesday.
   ``You've got people throwing themselves on the ground trying to
trip you up and make you fall, peeking under the umbrella and all
that,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``I was in a lot of pain. I could have been hemorrhaging or
bleeding to death, and here they are,'' she said. ``Nobody should
have to go through that kind of terrorism.''
   On Wednesday, the center, which serves 10 to 50 patients a day
in a building near downtown, braced for a morning protest. Two
police officers were stationed at the clinic's entrances.
   Other police officers, several on horseback, deployed at metal
curbside barricades. Employees and pro-choice volunteers gripped
black umbrellas labeled ``Choice'' as they waited to escort
patients into the facility.
   The demonstrators arrived in midafternoon with drastically
reduced ranks. Most demonstrators said they limited their
activities to praying and singing hymns.
   As a patient approached the building surrounded by escorts, one
male demonstrator shouted ``Jesus said, `Suffer little children
that come unto me!' Don't you hear your baby begging for his
life?'''
   Patients inside shied away from the clinic's windows and
whispered among themselves. Employees occasionally stepped away
from their duties to check on the demonstrators and talk with the
policemen.
   Center director Lynne Randall spent most of the day outside
meeting with police officials and volunteers.
   ``It's just really been frantic, with all of this going on,''
she said. ``It's had a big impact on the staff and the patients.''
   Ms. Randall, who was wearing a large button that read ``I
Survived Operation Rescue,'' said the demonstrators were ``acting
like thugs.''
   ``We just want to make sure everything is going well,'' she said.
   Protesters began the demonstrations here July 19, during the
Democratic National Convention.
   Protest leaders frequently have likened their efforts to civil
rights demonstrations and say they are following the non-violent
teachings of such leaders as the late Martin Luther King Jr.
   Protesters on Tuesday complained that police treated them with
unnecessary harshness, twisting arms and fingers and using
pressure-point holds just under the ears to force them into buses.
   ``I think what is happening in Atlanta right now is just
terribly anti-American,'' said City Councilman Hosea Williams, a
colleague of King's. ``It hurts me so bad that we who were the
leaders of the movement in the '50s, '60s and '70s, are now the
political leaders, and we are doing the same things to
demonstrators that George Wallace and Bull Connor and those did to
us.''
   However, another King colleague, Rep. John Lewis, said that
while there are similarities to methods he employed 20 years ago,
the aims are different.
   ``Very rarely did we deliberately try to close down a
business,'' the Georgia Democrat said. ``We didn't want to
interfere with the free flow of commerce.''

<HEAD>New Yorkers Face Record $3 Billion Bond Issue for Roads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With memories still fresh of a bridge
collapsing into a rushing creek and killing 10 people, Gov. Mario
Cuomo is asking voters to approve the biggest bond issue in New
York history to repair roads.
   The $3 billion bond issue on the ballot Nov. 8 comes five years
after voters agreed to Cuomo's proposal to borrow $1.25 billion to
``rebuild New York.''
   With the money from the earlier bond issue due to run out in
March, New York has 1,600 miles of highway deemed to be in poor
condition by its inspectors, 660 miles of roads too small to handle
the traffic and 7,400 bridges rated unacceptable.
   ``Everybody concedes the need,'' said Cuomo. ``I hear no one
arguing (against) the absolute necessity of investing billions and
billions of dollars in our roads and bridges.''
   A coalition of construction and labor officials supporting the
bond issue is reminding voters of the April 1987 collapse of the
New York State Thruway bridge over the rushing Schoharie Creek west
of Albany.
   ``Where will you be the next time the worst case happens?'' asks
one TV commercial.
   Conservative rural upstate politicians, the New York chapter of
the American Automobile Association and the New York Farm Bureau
are among the opponents of the bond issue.
   They agree roads are in disrepair but are pressing for a
pay-as-you-go system with New York dedicating all highway, gasoline
and automobile-related taxes and fees to road construction and
repair.
   ``Borrowing begets borrowing,'' said James McGowan, vice
president of the 1.8 million-member state AAA. ``The '83 bond issue
begat the '88 bond issue. Then where do we go? The next logical
step is for a $7.5 billion bond issue in 1992 and then maybe a $15
billion bond issue in 1995. That's the way we're going.''
   Cuomo has told New Yorkers that if enough of them don't vote
``yes'' in November, they may face an increase of as much as 20
cents on New York's 8-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax to pay for
needed highway work.
   AAA officials contend taxes will have to be raised anyway. ``The
enormous costs of the debt service from the bonds are going to have
be borne by somebody,'' said McGowan.

<HEAD>Pentagon Slashes Cost Estimate for First Phase of SDI Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what one official acknowledged was ``a
startling change,'' the Defense Department said Thursday it has
slashed the cost of the first phase of a Star Wars defensive shield
from $115 billion to $69 billion, and the system could be available
within a decade.
   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the figures should be viewed with ``some
skepticism'' because the cost of weapons programs often goes down
while they are in the planning stages and then rises when
production starts.
   The new figures arise from a restructuring of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, the formal name of President Reagan's
5-year-old program to develop a high-tech shield against attack by
Soviet nuclear missiles.
   Those changes were approved after Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci ordered a review when it became apparent the
Democratic-controlled Congress would cut Reagan's Star Wars budget
request for the fiscal year that began last Saturday.
   The president sought $4.8 billion for Star Wars, but Congress
approved $4.1 billion, up from last year's $3.9 billion budget.
   The current debate over Star Wars centers around plans to
develop a first-stage program that could form the basis of a
wide-ranging system.
   The initial phase is based chiefly on space-based interceptor
rockets, known as SBIs, that would be housed in flying ``garages''
circling the globe, ready to be fired at launched Soviet missiles.
   The large cost reduction is chiefly achieved by scaling back
plans for the number of interceptor rockets, Pentagon officials
told a joint hearing of the Senate and House Armed Services
committees.
   ``This is a startling change,'' acknowledged Robert Costello,
undersecretary of defense for acquisition.
   Wwhile the exact figure is classified, the Pentagon said ``there
would be fewer than 200 carrier vehicles (garages) with several
SBIs aboard each carrier.''
   The Defense Department also said it can develop a better
guidance unit for the rockets, meaning the chances of success for
each rocket would be increased and thus the number that would have
to be fired would be reduced.
   In addition, the sophistication of a planned surveillance and
tracking satellite system is being reduced, leading to another
savings.
   Air Force Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, director of the SDI
program, said the decision whether to build a first-stage system
could be made early in the next decade, with deployment to begin in
the late 1990s.
   Abrahamson also disputed critics who say that the program's
original goal of protecting U.S. population centers has changed to
protection of nuclear weapons sites.
   ``The goals have not changed,'' Abrahamson said, and the program
is still aimed at building protection for people.
   Air Force Gen. Robert Herres, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, was more cautious about the program, saying ``one should
not expect a militarily useful system'' until after the first phase
is constructed.
   The lowered cost doesn't mean a reduction in the system, Herres
said. ``There's no reason to believe there's going to be a
reduction in capability.''
   Both Herres and Abrahamson said development of a first-phase SDI
would mean that the United States would have to withdraw from the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, the 1972 pact that limits the
defenses each superpower can build.
   Congress and the administration have been arguing over how to
interpret the treaty, with Reagan seeking a ``broad'' view that
would permit expanded SDI testing and congressional Democrats
backing a ``narrow'' view that they say wouldn't damage the pact.
   In answer to questions, Costello said the administration,
shortly before it leaves office next January, plans to tell
Congress about future SDI testing plans and how those projects
would affect the ABM treaty.
   ``At some point, we have to have a broad interpretation or break
out'' of the treaty, Costello said.
   He said the decision is ``way down the road,'' but Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., said, ```way down the road' is too vague.''
   At that point, Costello said future testing plans are now under
development.
   The changes announced Thursday were approved by the Defense
Acqusition Board, the Pentagon's highest weapons review panel.
   Abrahamson complained about congressional budget cuts, saying
they had hurt the program. Congress has annually reduced the
proposed SDI budget, although granting increases from previous
years.
   Because of uncertainty last summer about spending for the
first-phase SDI project, Star Wars contractors laid off 1,600
employees, Abrahamson said.

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Exempt Some Savings Bonds from Income Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate today voted 94-0 to exempt from
federal income tax U.S. savings bonds that are bought to finance a
college or vocational education.
   ``This is a simple, sensible way to help families save for
college expenses,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., sponsor
of the proposal. ``It sends a loud, clear message about our
priorities.''
   Kennedy's provision was attached to a bill that corrects errors
in the 1986 tax overhaul, grants special tax relief to various
groups of taxpayers, and includes tax increases to pay for the
benefits. The bill is one of the few major pieces of legislation
standing in the way of adjournment of the 100th Congress.
   Kennedy's college-expenses amendment is similar to one that
President Reagan proposed in the budget that he submitted to
Congress last January.
   Under the provision, a family could avoid tax on any savings
bonds that are redeemed to pay for post-secondary education of any
family member.
   The full tax exemption would be available to families with
adjusted gross incomes of up to $60,000 a year. Those with incomes
between $60,000 and $80,000 would get a reduced benefit; no
exemption would be allowed those with incomes over $80,000 a year.
   The change would cost the government an estimated $285 million a
year by 1984. Under Kennedy's amendment, that cost would be paid by
eliminating the tax exemption now allowed parents for any dependent
child over the age of 24 who is a full-time student.
   Buyers of U.S. savings bonds pay no tax on the interest they
earn until the bonds are redeemed. They already are exempt from
state and local income taxes.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
said investigations into the alleged slayings of 10 peasants by
soldiers were inconclusive, and he ordered that the matter be
studied further.
   As Duarte spoke with journalists Wednesday, forensic specialists
exhumed the bodies of seven of 10 people killed Sept. 21 in San
Francisco, 30 miles east of San Salvador.
   Forensic physician Roberto Maldonado told reporters after the
first three bodies were pulled from the mass grave that powder
burns indicated they were shot from six inches away.
   The bodies of three other people killed Sept. 21 were buried in
nearby San Sebastian and were to be exhumed later.
   Relatives and neighbors of the seven men and three women slain
said they were killed by soldiers of the Jiboa Battalion after most
of the town's residents were detained on suspicion of collaborating
with leftist guerrillas.
   The army said eight villagers were detained but that they were
killed when guerrillas ambushed the army unit taking them to a base
for interrogation.
   No soldier was killed in the alleged ambush, the army said. It
said two attacking guerrillas were killed.
   Duarte said he had received four reports on the killings _ from
a human rights commission, the attorney general's office, the armed
forces and the office of the Roman Catholic archbishop of San
Salvador.
   ``I am still studying the case, but until now none of the
documents provides sufficient criteria. I have asked the attorney
general's office and the armed forces to deepen their
investigations,'' Duarte said.
   Leftist rebels have fought a 9-year-old civil war against the
U.S.-backed government.
   The army has not been accused of civilian killings on the scale
of the San Francisco killings in four years.
   Also Wednesday, about 300 National University students marched
through downtown San Salvador with a coffin containing the body of
a university security guard slain Monday.
   The state university, in a statement, said guard Raul Santos
Escamilla, 34, was shot by two men in a university cafeteria.
   ``This criminal act is part of the government and military
campaign against the university's just struggles,'' the communique
said.
   The military considers the National University a stronghold of
guerrilla supporters.
   Santos had been detained for three days last year by National
Police on suspicion of guerrilla collaboration. He was released for
lack of evidence.

off the Baltic coast, police said Thursday.
   West German border police in Flensburg said the men, both 22,
eluded East German patrol boats when they set out Tuesday from the
Baltic city of Wismar. The two were picked up in Danish territorial
waters by a Greek freighter early Wednesday, police said. They were

   Montana has become the 16th state to
complete its portion of the interstate highway system, bridging a
3{-mile gap that confounded engineers for nearly 20 years,
officials said.
   Construction workers last week completed Interstate 15 south of
Dillon, near the Idaho border. Work on the last gap in Montana's
1,200-mile, 30-year, $1.2 billion program began in the 1960s but
triggered a slow earth slide.
   ``About once a month, we went down, stood on it and looked wise,
and tried to figure out what the hell to do with this mountain,''
said Dave Johnson, state engineering specialty supervisor.
   The problem was solved by boring holes and draining away the
water lubricating the earth slide, and construction resumed in the
early 1980s.

<TEXT>
   Geoffrey Household, whose adventure novels include
the tale of an English hunter who stalks Adolf Hitler, is dead at
age 87, his family said Thursday.
   The writer's home was near Banbury, 65 miles from London. The
family said he died Tuesday, and no cause of death was given.
   Household said the story of an attempt to kill Hitler came to
him because ``the man had to be dealt with and I began to think how
much I would love to kill him.''
   The hero of ``Rogue Male,'' published in 1939, is an
aristocratic big-game hunter who is caught and tortured by the
Nazis but escapes.
   During World War II, Household served as a commando in Romania
and later as an intelligence officer in Greece, Palestine, Syria
and Iraq.
   He was educated at Oxford, then traveled and worked at various
jobs in Europe, the Near East, South America and the United States.
He used the impressions gained from his travels in his novels.
   A magazine financed him to write the ``The Third Hour,'' a novel
published in 1937. His first book of short stories, ``The Salvation
of Pisco Gabar,'' appeared in 1938.
   Household resumed writing after the war, producing adventure
stories with such titles as ``A Rough Shoot'' in 1951 and ``Watcher
in the Shadows'' in 1960.
   He also wrote picaresque romances, children's books, stories
about the supernatural and an autobiography, ``Against The Wind,''
published in 1958.
   Surviving are his wife, Ilona Zsoldos-Gutman, a son and two
daughters.

<TEXT>
   Teen-age mothers enrolled in a comprehensive
program to train them for jobs and help them become better parents
went on to earn higher salaries than women who did not receive the
help, it was reported Thursday.
   Children of women aided by Project Redirection also did better
than the children of the comparison group, said researchers who
followed up on those who participated in the program five years ago.
   ``The program led to more people working _ and people earning
more when they were working,'' said Judith Gueron, president of the
Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., which managed the project.
   Project Redirection, funded by the Ford Foundation and the U.S.
Department of Labor, operated from 1980 to 1982 in Boston, New
York, Phoenix and Riverside, Calif., and later extended to seven
other places, the foundation said. More than 800 teen-age mothers
participated for about a year each.
   Five years after the program, 34 percent of the women who had
participated in Project Redirection were employed, earning an
average of $200 a week, said Ms. Gueron.
   Among a comparison group that was not enrolled in the program,
28 perwent of the women were employed five years later, and they
earned an average of $161 a week.
   Researchers said the project's most dramatic impact was on
teen-agers who were receiving welfare when they enrolled in the
program.
   Five years later, 34 percent had gotten jobs. They earned an
average of $224 a week.
   Among the comparison group initially on welfare, 24 percent were
employed five years later. They earned an average of $154 a week.
   ``We've known for some time that teen mothers are at great risk
of long-term welfare dependency,'' Ms. Gueron. ``It is particularly
helpful to have positive results now that Congress and the states
have shown interest in making teen mothers a priority for
services.''
   The program targeted low-income women, 17 years old or younger,
who had a child or were pregnant and who had not completed high
school. They received health care, education and help preparing for
jobs, and also learned nutrition, family planning, parenting skills
and household budgeting. Women from the community served as mentors
for the teens.
   The researchers found that the program enhanced the teen-agers'
parenting skills. Their children scored better in vocabulary and
behavior than did the children of women not enrolled in the program.
   To build on the findings of Project Redirection, Ms. Gueron's
company, a nonprofit research organization that designs and
evaluates programs for the disadvantaged, is developing another
program called New Chance.
   That project is expected to provide education and employment
services for up to 2,000 mothers, all high school dropouts on
welfare, in 20 communities.

   Moslem fundamentalists announced a truce
Thursday in their power struggle with pro-PLO leaders. Assailants
killed two Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   The truce ended a rift that threatened to undermine the nearly
10-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We must be united despite the differences in our beliefs,''
the Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas said in leaflets distributed
Thursday. ``We are against any kind of split.''
   A Hamas leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his
group and the PLO-backed Unified National Leadership of the
Uprising agreed to coordinate general strikes, stop street fighting
between the two groups and end the ``graffiti war'' of defamatory
slogans aimed at each other.
   ``When we fight each other we are only helping the enemy
(Israel),'' said the bearded 25-year-old Hamas leader in an
interview.
   Hamas advocates destruction of Israel and is politically at odds
with PLO chief Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, which is considering
recognition of the Jewish state.
   A Palestine Liberation Organization official in Nicosia, Cyprus,
confirmed that meetings with Hamas took place but would not
elaborate. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Since the start of the uprising, Hamas has repeatedly challenged
the Unified Leadership, which is made up of various PLO factions.
Last month, a successful general strike called by Hamas in defiance
of the PLO sparked fistfights between rival activists.
   Also Thursday, assailants killed Mustafa Salim Abu Bakr, 46, a
mukhtar, or traditional leader, in the West Bank village of Biddya.
They suspected him of selling village land to Israelis.
   Bakr was driving in his car with his two sons, ages 8 and 14,
when assailants in Biddya blocked the road with burning tires,
witnesses said.
   The gunmen opened fire, killing Bakr and wounding his two sons.
The assailants set Bakr's body on fire after the attack, witnesses
said.
   The army confirmed the death and clamped a curfew on Biddya, 45
miles north of Jerusalem. The radio said troops arrested several
Palestinians.
   The second victim, 25-year-old Ahmed Sahour, was sprayed with
gunfire in a cafe in the Israeli Arab village of Umm El Fahm, where
he had been hiding since being chased out of the nearby West Bank
village of Amin, the radio and Arab witnesses said.
   The deaths brought to 283 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8. Of those, nine were suspected
collaborators. Six Israelis have been killed.
   Also Thursday, six Palestinians were wounded in clashes with
troops, five of them in the Gaza Strip and one in the West Bank,
Arab hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed two wounded in the Gaza Strip and said it was
checking the other reports.

<HEAD>Hospital Care for AIDS Children Tops $90,000, Much Unnecessary:
Studies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 5:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Children infected with the virus that causes AIDS
are running up hospital bills of more than $90,000 each, often
because they simply have nowhere else to go, studies indicate.
   ``Many of these children are in the hospital not because they're
sick with AIDS or with anything else,'' said Dr. Kathi Kemper, who
examined cases of children testing positive for evidence of AIDS
infection at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.
   ``But because they test positive, nobody wants to take care of
them at home or in foster care, and so there's no place else for
them to go,'' she said in a telephone interview Thursday.
``Basically, they're in the hospital like a day-care center.''
   Home lives of such babies tend to be chaotic because the mothers
who transmitted the virus to them usually are intravenous drug
abusers, often sick themselves and possibly in jail, researchers
said.
   A significant number of babies who test positive aren't even
infected _ they simply are carrying AIDS antibodies they inherited
from their mothers, said Ms. Kemper, now with Harborview Medical
Center in Seattle, Wash.
   AIDS antibodies _ natural disease-fighting agents produced by a
person's system in the face of AIDS infection _ fade from
uninfected babies' bloodstreams by age 6 months to 15 months, she
said. All AIDS tests in current use detect antibodies to the virus,
rather than the virus itself.
   Even youngsters who really are sick often are put in the
hospital or kept there unnecessarily, Ms. Kemper said. ``Some of
them easily could be getting treatment on an outpatient basis.''
   Yet potential foster families often fear they might catch AIDS _
a remote possibility _ and insurance and Medicaid policies are set
up to reimburse for hospital care more efficiently than for
outpatient or home care, she said.
   By Sept. 26, the federal Centers for Disease Control had
recorded 1,185 cases of AIDS among children under age 13, of whom
672 had died. Medical researchers have estimated that 10,000
children could be infected by 1991.
   The study by Ms. Kemper and colleague Brian Forsyth, published
in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association, looked at
children who had tested positive for AIDS antibodies at Yale-New
Haven Hospital through Oct. 31, 1987.
   ``Among children eligible for the study, 54 percent of their
hospital days were judged medically unnecessary,'' the study said.
   The most common non-medical reason for hospitalization was lack
of any other place to send the child, it said.
   A related study in Friday's Journal found that hospital stays
for children infected with the AIDS virus ranged from $466 per day
for ``boarder babies'' _ those who simply had nowhere else to go _
to $705 per day for the sickest youngsters.
   That study, led by James D. Hegarty of Harlem Hospital Center in
New York, looked at 37 children diagnosed with AIDS or an
AIDS-related condition in that hospital from 1981 through 1986.
   ``Average lifetime costs were $90,347 per child,'' the study
said. ``One third of the total inpatient days and over 20 percent
of the cost resulted from social rather than medical factors.''
   Ms. Kemper called for better education and better reimbursement
for potential foster parents and modified policies under the
Medicaid program and private insurance plans.
   She noted that Connecticut waged a foster-parent education
campaign and boosted reimbursement to $1,000 a month for foster
families, helping reduce the rate of unnecessary hospital days from
64 percent in 1983 and 1984 to 30 percent in 1987 for the children
studied.

<HEAD>Judge Raps Prosecutors for Seeking Indictment in Wrong
Jurisdiction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge sharply criticized Iran-Contra
prosecutors on Thursday for charging a former CIA station chief in
the nation's capital with committing crimes across the Potomac
River in Virginia.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. questioned a proposal
by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to dismiss all the charges
against Joseph F. Fernandez so prosecutors could seek a new
indictment from a federal grand jury in nearby Alexandria, Va.
   ``I don't think it's a simple matter of I'll dismiss it and let
you go to Virginia and re-indict it,'' Robinson told Laurence
Shtasel, an associate independent counsel.
   The judge did not indicate how he would rule on Walsh's request,
which was made in a response to a defense motion to dismiss four of
the indictment's five counts on the ground those alleged offenses
occurred at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. instead of in
Washington.
   Fernandez, who used the pseudonym Tomas Castillo when he was the
CIA's station chief in Costa Rica, is accused of conspiring with
former National Security Council aide Oliver L. North to illegally
ship arms to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Robinson said he found no basis for dismissing that count, since
the alleged conspiracy took place both in Washington and elsewhere.
   But the judge sharply questioned the prosecution decision to
indict Fernandez, 51, in Washington on four counts of making false
statements in Virginia to CIA superiors and to a presidential
commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair.
   Robinson also lectured the prosecutors about fairness saying:
``There has to be a sense of justice in the process as well as the
outcome, otherwise public confidence in the system is destroyed.''
   Laurence Shtasel, an associate independent counsel, said
prosecutors had not misled the grand jury about the venue _ or
location _ of the four alleged crimes, and had advised the panel
that Fernandez could waive his right to be tried in Virginia.
   The grand jury included the four Virginia charges because they
were related to the conspiracy, Shtasel said.
   ``That doesn't give it any right to indict when the venue of the
case is not here,'' Robinson said. ``It's the government's
responsibility to advise the grand jury what it can or cannot do
under the law.''
   Defense attorney Thomas E. Wilson argued that Walsh should be
barred from bringing the charges anew in Virginia, saying
prosecutors ``were trifling with the process.''
   ``They intentionally pursued an indictment where they knew there
was not even a colorable basis of venue on four of five counts,''
Wilson said.
   ``The prosecutors in this case are not beleaguered, overworked
assistant U.S. attorneys,'' Wilson said. Walsh ``assembled the
prosecutorial equivalent of a Roman legion: 29 lawyers, 33 FBI
agents, 11 IRS agents, four Customs agents.''
   ``They are trifling with the process _ they ought to be stuck
with the consequences,'' Wilson said.
   But Robinson said he ``didn't know any basis for dismissing''
the conspiracy charge against Fernandez.
   ``The nub of the case is the conspiracy indictment, any way you
look at it, everything else is superfluous really,'' the judge told
Shtasel.
   But he said allowing Walsh to try Fernandez in Washington on the
conspiracy count and obtain another indictment in Virginia ``places
an intolerable burden on a single defendant.''

   A fund has been set to handle donations to
help the Yellowstone National Park area recover from this summer's
devastating fires, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the department's Forest Service,
said the Greater Yellowstone Area Recovery Fund has been
established in response to offers from individuals and groups
wishing to make donations.
   Thirteen major fires burned 1.6 million acres in the greater
Yellowstone area, including 566,508 acres on national forests,
including parts of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
   Robertson said the donations will be used for cleanup operations
and to collect local seed, grow seedlings, plant trees, control
erosion and repair damaged facilities.
   ``We also have received many offers of seeds and seedlings,'' he
said. ``Unfortunately, we usually cannot accept these because the
tree species offered is not native to the local area and would not
survive.''
   Donations can be sent to: Forest Service, 11177 West 8th Ave.,
Lakewood, Colo. 80225-0127. Checks should be made out to
``USDA-Forest Service,'' and ``Greater Yellowstone Area Recovery
Fund'' should be specified on the check.
   Those wishing to donate to help fire recovery on national
forests in other areas of the country may do so by contacting the
Forest Service's public affairs office in Washington, D.C., or
individual national forests.
   The public affairs office address is P.O. Box 96090, Washington,
D.C. 20090-6090. The telephone number is 202-447-3760.

<TEXT>
   A Federal Trade Commission staffer, in hot
water over some politically oriented letters he sent out, told a
House subcommittee Thursday that he was just doing what he thought
was expected.
   Carter L. Clews, who was fired from the FTC and then reinstated
pending a formal investigation of his activities, admitted sending
letters to the news media critical of statements made by Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   ``I had simply tried to do my job as I understood it,'' Clews
said.
   He told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that the
letters he sent out had been seen by his superiors at the agency's
press office before they were dispatched.
   Anna H. Davis, director of the FTC Office of Public Affairs,
denied that, saying that the problem was in a postscript Clews
added to one letter without her knowledge, and that other letters
he sent out were not authorized at all.
   The letters were sent to broadcasters and newspapers in an
effort to counter a statement by Dukakis that the FTC's antitrust
efforts had been a joke.
   In the letters, Clews challenged that statement and offered the
services of commission members for interviews to discuss the
agency's activities and Dukakis' remarks. That drew a challenge
from two commissioners, Democrat Andrew Strenio and independent
Mary Azcuenaga, who questioned whether the letters violated the
Hatch Act, which bans political activities by federal workers.
   Clews then left the commission after being given a choice of
resigning or being fired, he testified. But he later complained
that his resignation had come under duress, so he was returned to
the payroll pending an investigation. He is currently on
administrative leave.
   Mrs. Davis testified that one letter, sent to 800 talk show
hosts across the nation, had been approved by agency officials, but
that Clews subsequently added a postscript on his own and got a
commission intern to sign Mrs. Davis' name.
   Clews told the subcommittee on oversignt and investigation that
the intern signed the letter because Mrs. Davis had approved it but
was out of town at the time it had to be printed. As for the
postscript, he said he assumed Mrs. Davis was aware of it because
she was present when the letter was placed in envelopes for mailing.
   A second letter questioning Dukakis' statements was sent to
several columnists, carrying Clews' signature. He contended that
Mrs. Davis had seen that letter in advance, but she denied that and
testified that Clews had sent that out on his own, avoiding normal
clearance procedures.
   A third letter offering to respond to Dukakis was sent to
Washington news bureau chiefs under Mrs. Davis' signature.
   Clews testified that he had written that letter also and sent it
to Mrs. Davis, who he said signed it. In her statement, however,
Mrs. Davis said, ``While the signature is very similar to mine, I
did not sign it, nor do I know who signed it.''

   A former sheriff who admitted taking
payoffs to protect bootleggers in his dry county was sentenced
Thursday to a four-year prison term and a $5,000 fine.
   Former Scott County Sheriff Glen Warren, 54, and former Chief
Deputy Will Reed, 43, had pleaded guilty to two counts of extortion
each. They acknowledged taking payoffs from bootleggers in exchange
for protecting them from raids by agents from the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Division of the state Tax Commission.
   Reed, who said he acted at Warren's biding, was sentenced to one
year in jail by U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate, who also
fined him $2,500.
   The maximum penalty Warren and Reed could have received was 40
years in prison and $500,000 in fines.
   Five bootleggers pleaded guilty to perjury charges after they
lied to a federal grand jury investigating payoffs.
   Warren, who had been in office for eight years, sought
re-election but lost to retired state Trooper William S. Richardson
last year.

   April Fools' Day only comes once a year,
so people with a semiannual urge for silliness should welcome Dick
Dunn's campaign to make Oct. 6 Mad Hatter Day.
   ``Outrageous statements and non sequiturs are the order of the
day,'' Dunn, a computer worker at Interactive Systems, wrote in a
letter to the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper.
   In the tradition of such Boulder events as kinetic sculptures
and harmonic convergences, Mad Hatter Day _ named in honor of the
befuddled fellow in Lewis Carroll's ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland'' _ was born one day in 1986 after Dunn spent hours
hacking away at his keyboard.
   Dunn, 39, said he chose Oct. 6 because Sir John Tenniel's
classic illustrations of Carroll's stories show the Mad Hatter in a
top hat with a slip stuck in the band noting: ``In this style _
10-6.'' The slip actually notes a hat order and price, but Dunn
decided the corresponding calendar date would be appropriate for
his holiday.
   He concedes the word of the holiday has been slow in spreading,
but he has garnered some support from local officials.
   Boulder city spokesman David Grimm said he was game to
contribute some silliness.
   ``I do that every day,'' he said.

   Is a student of Savage Elementary a wild
child?
   Parents seeking to a different name for the town's only
elementary school say the current one gives students an
undeservedly raucous reputation. But those behind a ``save Savage''
effort say they seek to preserve the memory of local entrepreneur
M.W. Savage.
   The name is particularly hard on Savage Elementary youngsters
who go on to school elsewhere, said School Board Chairman Larry
Carlberg. ``They're known as the Savage kids,'' he said.
   But a recent bid to change the name has raised the rankles of
old-timers and history buffs in this town of 8,000 people. With the
backing of the City Council, American Legion and Chamber of
Commerce, the ``save Savage'' effort has gathered 731 signatures
opposing the change.
   ``I've gone to school there. We have two sons that also went to
school there,'' said Carol Gutoske, who's lived in Savage for 40
years. ``Nobody I talked to thought it was detrimental.''
   The town's name dates to the early 1900s, when M.W. Savage
gained widespread fame for the success of his harness-racing horse,
Dan Patch. He built a horse training farm, a racetrack and an
electric railway in Savage, gradually reshaping the Minnesota River
town's image.
   The town's name was changed from Hamilton to Savage in his honor.
   Supporters of the name change said they never meant to create
such controversy.
   ``Our purpose is not to divide the community or anything like
that,'' said Mary Eichen, president of the parent-teacher
organization. ``It's just something we thought would be a good
idea.''
   The school board is expected to vote on the matter later this
month.

<HEAD>Gleason Book Collection Reveals Taste For Supernatural</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jackie Gleason's reading tastes leaned heavily
toward offbeat subjects like UFOs, parapsychology and the occult _
1,700 of 3,700 volumes in the late comedian's collection of books
dealt with those topics.
   The collection has been donated by Gleason's widow, Marilyn, to
the University of Miami library. The actor best known as the
blowhard bus driver Ralph Kramden on television's ``The
Honeymooners'' died last year at age 71.
   ``Some of these books are kind of crackpot. Things like, `I Rode
in a Spaceship,''' UM librarian Jay Kalvan said. ``He went out of
his way to collect books on the occult. He was just personally
interested in any unexplained phenomenon. He didn't just collect
it, he read it.''
   After cataloging, the collection will be available for
inspection by the public by appointment.
   Frank Rodgers, director of UM libraries, said Mrs. Gleason
donated the collection in recognition of his longtime association
with Miami. Gleason did his TV variety show live from Miami Beach
for many years.
   ``She wanted them to stay in this community,'' Rodgers said.
``And we're delighted she came to that decision.''
   Gleason friend Hank Meyer, the publicist who lured Gleason's
show to Miami Beach in the 1950s, said the books reflect a
little-known side of the comic.
   ``That flamboyant image he had, that wasn't Jackie,'' Meyer
said. ``He was really very quiet, serious and introspective.'' The
publicist said Gleason was a ``voracious'' reader who went through
three or four books a week.
   ``He was a very bright person and he had a photographic
memory,'' he said. ``He would recall every passage he read. That's
why he never rehearsed (scenes from his shows). He'd read a script
once and have it memorized.''

<HEAD>Army To Study Whether Blacks Unjustly Denied Medals in WWI</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Army has agreed to review the records of
black World War I heroes following an acknowledgement by Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci that racial discrimination ``could well
have extended to individual decisions leading to the awarding of
medals,'' a lawmaker said Thursday.
   Rep. Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y., made the disclosure in releasing
letters from Carlucci and another Pentagon official.
   DioGuardi and Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, have been seeking
posthumous Medals of Honor for two black servicemen: Army Sgt.
Henry Johnson of Albany, N.Y., who served during World War I; and
Navy Seaman Dorrie Miller, of Waco, Texas, who died in World War II.
   The congressmen introduced legislation last October that would
have waived the five-year statute of limitations governing the
awarding of Medals of Honor, opening the way for consideration of
the Miller and Johnson cases. But because of Pentagon objections,
the bills stalled in the House Armed Services Committee.
   DioGuardi and Leland, along with 102 colleagues, wrote to
Carlucci in June, and the letter released Thursday was the
secretary's reply.
   ``It is clear that unjust discrimination existed during World
Wars I and II that could well have extended to individual decisions
leading to the awarding of medals in recognition of heroic
actions,'' Carlucci wrote.
   ``As you know, while there were a number of instances where
black World War I and World War II service members were recognized
by individual awards for heroism, none was awarded the Medal of
Honor.''
   Some 1.5 million blacks served in the world wars.
   Carlucci emphasized that the Defense Department ``does not
support a symbolic award'' of the Medal of Honor, the nation's
highest military honor. He also reiterated the department's
objections to bills singling out Johnson and Miller ``when many
other individuals might have been equally deserving.''
   ``Nevertheless, I am willing as a result of your expressed
concern to conduct further research to examine the conditions
existing in the past concerning award of decorations and medals and
the extent to which racial discrimination might have been part of
those conditions,'' the secretary wrote.
   DioGuardi also released a letter from Assistant Defense
Secretary Grant S. Green Jr., who said the Army will review the war
records of blacks who served in World War I and received French
military honors or the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's
second-highest honor.
   ``Research will be difficult because of the passage of time and
the destruction of so many records in the fire at the National
Personnel Records Center in 1973,'' Green wrote.
   He estimated that the review, which has already begun, would
take ``in excess of six months.''
   The Army research will cover servicemen from the all-black 92nd
and 93rd Divisions during World War I and will attempt ``to
ascertain why Sgt. Henry Johnson, a member of the 93rd Division,
was not recognized by the U.S. Army for his actions in combat and
for wounds received in action,'' Green wrote.
   The Army will also try to identify any black World War I
soldiers who were recommended for the Medal of Honor but were
disapproved or received lesser awards, he said.
   In a handwritten footnote, Green said he has asked the Navy ``to
report back to us on the magnitude of doing something similar for
WWII.''
   Blacks were denied naval combat duty during World War I, making
such research unnecessary, DioGuardi said. But he said he is trying
to get the Army to do similar research into black soldiers who
served in World War II.
   Johnson, who served in France, was on sentry duty one night when
he killed four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and
captured a stockpile of weapons, despite being severely wounded
himself. He received the Croix de Guerre, France's highest military
honor.
   Miller was serving as a mess steward aboard the USS Virginia
when the ship was attacked at Pearl Harbor. After the captain was
mortally wounded, Miller dragged him off deck. Miller then manned a
machine gun and shot down two enemy aircraft.
   He was awarded the Navy Cross, the service's second highest
honor, and was killed when his ship was torpedoed in 1943.

<HEAD>U.S. Grants Consular Status to Israeli Military, Trade Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Thursday it has
agreed to Israeli demands that officials in Israel's arms-buying
office in New York receive limited diplomatic immunity after the
office was investigated for illegal exports of U.S. military
technology.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said extension of
``consular privileges'' to about 50 of the 250 employees in the
procurement mission and a trade office would probably not be
retroactive.
   U.S. officials said last month that Israel had been seeking in
months of talks the privileges for 47 staff members of its military
procurement office. They said the office has been investigated for
involvement in two cases of illegal export of American military
technology.
   Mrs. Oakley said she was unsure of the differences between
consular privileges and full diplomatic immunity but that
``diplomatic immunity is more extensive than the consular status.''
   Other officials said the status provides protection only for
activities directly connected to a person's official functions, not
for all crimes.
   ``The Israeli defense procurement mission and the trade mission
in New York will be considered as annexes to the Israeli consulate
in New York,'' she said. ``We estimate that approximately 50
Israeli officials will require consular privileges.''
   ``Most other countries that conduct defense procurement
activities from offices in the United States do so from within
their embassies in Washington and are therefore covered by
diplomatic immunities and privileges,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Members of an Egyptian military procurement office in Washington
have been given diplomatic immunity, officials said.
   An Egyptian military officer who worked at the office was
arrested by U.S. authorities earlier this year in an alleged plot
to smuggle missile components to Egypt, but he was freed after
claiming diplomatic immunity. He has returned to Egypt.
   The Justice Department in July 1986 reportedly sought to
investigate eight Israelis in New York suspected of the illegal
export of machinery needed to manufacture cluster bombs. Spokesman
John Russell said last May that the department decided against any
criminal prosecution.
   Another case last November involved a Connecticut company that
paid fines of $750,000 for violating U.S. export laws by smuggling
equipment and technology to Israel for the manufacture of
chrome-plated cannon barrels.

   The sister of the longest-held Middle
East hostage is asking Hank Williams Jr. and other country music
stars to sign a birthday card to cheer her brother during captivity.
   Peggy Say is asking performers to sign the 1{- by 2-foot card
during rehearsals for Monday's 22nd annual Country Music
Association awards show.
   Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, was abducted March 16, 1985. He will be 41 on
Oct. 27.
   The card will read: ``Happy birthday Terry from Music City, USA.
We love you and are praying for your freedom.''
   ``I've asked particularly to have Hank Williams Jr. sign it
because he is Terry's favorite,'' Mrs. Say said from her home in
Cadiz, Ky.
   She said the card would be displayed at a ceremony on Anderson's
birthday, and details would be released to newspapers in Beirut,
Lebanon, in hopes of reaching her brother.
   ``Hopefully Terry will see it and know that he's truly not
forgotten,'' Mrs. Say said.
   A spokesman for the State Department said the government does
not foresee immediate freedom for other hostages following a
captive's release earlier this week.
   Mithileshwar Singh, a 60-year-old Indian citizen and resident
alien of the United States, was in good spirits following his
release Monday after 20 months of captivity.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibility for Singh's kidnapping and said it
freed him as a goodwill gesture.
   His release raised hopes for the freedom of the 16 foreign
hostages still held in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say said she expected her brother to be released by the end
of the year. She did not indicate, however, that she had any
specific information about an impending release.
   The latest word on Anderson's condition came from Marcel
Fontaine, a French hostage released in May, according to Mrs. Say.
   ``He said that Terry was strong and determined to survive, that
Terry felt it would be the U.S. election before he would get out
and that he was gearing for that,'' she said.

on Capital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet-supported government on
Thursday strongly advocated reconciliation with Islamic guerrillas
after a recent escalation of rocket attacks on the capital.
   ``A concerted effort of all mentalities and from all walks of
life is urgently needed,'' Vice President Abdul Rahim Hatif said in
an interview during the two-hour flight from New Delhi to Kabul.
   Government press center staffers said the Central Committee of
the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan would meet Monday to
discuss ``important matters,'' including efforts to bring the
guerrillas into a dialogue with the government.
   Hatif, who said he was not a party member, is one of four vice
presidents named by President Najib four months ago in a show of
broadening the base of his government.
   However, key positions in the government _ including the
presidency _ are held by the party or by politicians closely
associated with it.
   The guerrillas, who call themselves Mujahedeen or Islamic Holy
Warriors, have steadfastly refused to deal with Najib's government.
   Although the Soviet Union has withdrawn about half the 115,000
troops deployed in Afghanistan in the past five months, the Soviet
presence is still heavy in Kabul, the capital.
   But the Soviet armor and aircraft have not deterred rocket
attacks on the city.
   On Wednesday morning, 42 rockets hit Kabul in less than three
hours, killing 13 people and wounding 34, according to Qurban
Shayrzad, the city's deputy police chief
   On Sept. 28, at least 33 people were killed and more than 130
wounded in the worst round of rocket attacks on Kabul in recent
memory. Most of the casualties were caused in a single attack at a
crowded bus stop.
   In an interview with Western reporters, Shayrzad blamed all the
attacks on the guerrillas.
   The opinion in the streets, however, seems less certain.
   Several Kabul civilians, speaking on condition of anonymity,
expressed belief that some of the rockets were fired by Soviet or
Afghan troops who blamed the guerrillas in an effort to alienate
support for them.
   Vice President Hatif said he thought a variety of political
views, including those of the guerrillas, should be represented in
the government. But he said he could not envision an interim
government without the People's Democratic Government Party.
   Diego Cordovez, special U.N. envoy for Afghan affairs, last
month in New York proposed creation of an interim government
composed of impartial Afghans, including those both in the country
and abroad.
   Hatif, a 63-year-old businessman, said any government should
have both public support and the means to defend itself.
   Referring to Cordovez's proposal, he asked: ``How would it be
possible for those people who have no public support to implement
their decisions? How would it be possible (for them) to come
between two warring parties?''
   He called the guerrillas ``irresponsible people with complicated
weapons,'' and he accused Pakistan and the United States of
continuing to arm the guerrillas even though the Soviet withdrawal
was half completed.
   Under terms of an April 14 agreement signed in Geneva,
Afghanistan and Pakistan pledged to stop interfering in each
other's domestic affairs. The United States and the Soviet Union
signed as guarantors of the accord, which calls for all Soviet
troops to leave Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   On Thursday, Kabul police escorted three Western reporters to
homes they said were hit by guerrilla rockets the previous day.
   The first house was occupied by a soldier, Mohammad Shah, who
said four women and one boy in his family were killed when a rocket
hit the wall around their home on the north edge of Kabul.
   At another house in the nearby Wazirabad neighborhood, four
girls between the ages of 2 and 9 were killed by a rocket,
according to their uncle, Mohammad Karim. Karim said he was a
political officer of the Sarandoy, a paramilitary police force.

   At 41, veteran hard rocker Iggy Pop is on
the comeback trail with what he feels is a clearer head and more
control of his music.
   Pop left the music scene in 1982, disillusioned after a 14-year
career. He resurfaced briefly with the 1986 album, ``Blah Blah
Blah.''
   ``I realized the way I was approaching my life and work had
become untenable,'' he said in a recent interview.
   ``I couldn't go on saying, `Let's get a couple of grams of blow
and write a song. Let's get stoned before the gig. Let's get stoned
after the gig. I'm in town, where are the girls?''' he said. ``I
was living the classic wild style, and that was no longer working
for me.''
   Pop said that lifestyle ``crept up on me slowly for years, and
it was a lot of work to change my way of thinking. I'm not AA or
anything. My ethic is that I work hard, do what I do under my own
power, and at the end of the day, like everybody else in the world,
I do what I can get away with.''
   Pop, who performs Sunday at the University of California,
Irvine, has just released the album ``Instinct.'' Admitting it may
be ``too steaming, too overdrive,'' he nonetheless says he's proud
that ``it's me, it's honest.''

   Charlie Daniels says he has quit
performing one of his biggest hits, ``Long Haired Country Boy,''
for fear that it glamorizes drug and alcohol abuse.
   The 1974 song talks about ``getting stoned every morning and
drunk every afternoon.''
   Daniels said in an interview Thursday the song was written in
fun but he did not want to make it appear that the record was
glorifying drinking and drug use.
   ``Times change, and I decided to take it out of the show. It was
the Christian thing to do,'' said the leader of the Charlie Daniels
Band. The five-piece country-rock group is also known for ``The

   U2 vocalist Bono, who says past live footage of

Grammy-winning Irish group's upcoming concert film captures its
commitment to rock 'n' roll.
   ``There's a lot at stake for us. It's something almost sacred,''
the singer said about ``U2 Rattle and Hum'' in the November issue
of Premiere magazine.
   ``It's what we do best,'' he said. ``We've never really been
able to make records. We're a live band, and that's more important
to me than the records.''
   Bono said ``U2 Rattle and Hum'' will show a side of him unknown
to those who've never seen the band live. ``Being on a stage is a
special place, a place apart. It's where I reach down into myself
and bring up stuff. ... There are times onstage where I completely
lose myself.''
   U2 will release a double-album soundtrack to the film, which is

   Prince Andrew said in a rare interview Thursday
that the long separations that his job as a junior officer demands
have been hard on his marriage.
   ``Before getting married I never bothered about going away
because it was fun. But I think to be split from one's wife for so
long cannot be good for the long-term relationship,'' Andrew told
Press Association, the British domestic news agency.
   Andrew, the Duke of York and a lieutenant aboard the HMS
Edinburgh, was separated from his wife, Sarah, from June until
mid-August when their first child was born, and for another month
until they met in Australia, where they are on an official visit.
The interview was conducted in Sydney.
   ``I don't like it, full stop,'' he said of the separations, but
added: ``You just have to take it, otherwise the navy could not
exist.''
   Andrew, 28, married Sarah Ferguson in July 1986. They have a
2-month-old daughter, Beatrice. Andrew has been in the navy for
nine years.

   A mistrial has been declared in a $2.75 million
suit filed against pop icon Prince by a TV cameraman who claims one
of the singer's bodyguards roughed him up.
   In declaring the mistrial Wednesday, Common Pleas Judge Frank J.
Gorman admonished The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer for revealing that
the camerman, James R. Gates, had rejected a $100,000 out-of-court
settlement over the 1984 incident. Gorman said the story would
prejudice the trial.
   When Prince's lawyer Terrence J. Kenneally asked Gorman to
declare the mistrial, Gates' lawyer, Jeffrey M. Embleton, said he
would not object.
   Prince offered testimony via videotape Tuesday. He is currently
on tour to promote his ``Lovesexy'' album.

   A parochial school teacher was shot and
seriously wounded Thursday when her sister entered the classroom,
told about 10 children to move back, then opened fire, police and
witnesses said.
   No children in the sixth-grade classroom at Most Pure Heart of
Mary School were hit.
   Police said the wounded teacher, Angela Jean Brown, 35, was hit
at least once in the midsection as several shots were fired from a
pistol. She was taken to Mobile Infirmary, where she was listed in
serious but stable condition.
   Less than an hour after the shooting, the teacher's sister,
Arilyn Jean Lelande, 29, was charged with first-degree assault,
Sgt. Lester Clark said.
   The shooting stemmed from ``an ongoing domestic problem between
the two sisters,'' Clark said. ``It wasn't anything like somebody
walking off the street.''
   The pupils said the woman with the gun told them to ``get back''
before turning to Mrs. Brown, who was seated at her desk. ``I want
my money,'' the children quoted the woman as saying before firing.
   ``I saw the children running and crying,'' said Patsy McDell, a
traffic officer at the school. ``I went to them and they told me
the teacher had been shot.''
   ``I saw the car speed out of the road with a woman driving. She
almost hit two kids,'' Mrs. McDell said.
   Police Sgt. James Mayo spotted Miss Lelande driving a few blocks
away from the school. ``I stopped her,'' he said. ``She got out of
the car, handed me the gun, which was still cocked and loaded, and
said, `Here it is.'''
   ``She asked me not to leave her car in the street, to have it
towed in because people in the neighborhood would tear it up,''
Mayo said.
   The first officer to arrive at the scene of the shooting,
Richard Henebry, said the teacher was conscious and told him, ``My
sister shot me.''
   Officials at the Roman Catholic school, which has an enrollment
of 180 in grades one through eight, said most children were
returned to the school later in the morning, but classes were
called off for some.
   There have been at least four shooting incidents at the nation's
schools in recent months, including three in the last month. Also,
trial began Wednesday in Huntsville for James Harvey, an unemployed
man defending himself on 110 kidnap counts for a 12-hour siege of a
private school in Tuscaloosa last February. Harvey told the jury he
was exercising his right to bear arms.
   On Monday, a gunman shot into an elementary school playground in
Mascotte, Fla., and wounded a third-grade student before
disappearing into the woods.
   On Sept. 26, a gunman at an elementary school in Greenwood,
S.C., wounded nine pupils, two fatally, and two teachers, before
being captured.
   Four days earlier, a man described by friends and relatives as
emotionally disturbed since serving in Vietnam stalked through an
auto parts store and a Chicago school, killing four people and
injuring two before being shot to death.
   On May 20 in the Chicago suburb of Winnetka, Ill., a mentally
disturbed woman, Laurie Dann, shot to death one youngster and
wounded five at an elementary school, then wounded a man at a
nearby house before taking her own life.

   The Grand Federal Edifice, the centerpiece

   The $100,000 recreation of a float that first rolled through
Philadelphia's streets on July 4, 1788, has stood in orphaned
grandeur among prison buses and police cars on a city parking lot
for much of the past year.
   Members of the Carpenters' Company and the Architectural
Woodwork Institute built the float with the intention that it could
be displayed as a lasting memorial of the bicentennial of the
Constitution.
   But the city, which was given the float after the Sept. 17,
1987, parade, hasn't received a proposal for its display by someone
who could care properly for it, officials said.
   ``We really had everyone's interest in mind,'' said Public
Property Commissioner Benjamin F. Ellis Jr. ``We didn't have any
intention of letting (the float) be destroyed.''
   For example, he said, ``There's no point in placing it in a
park. No one would maintain it, and it would be destroyed in two
years.''
   Edward Kobler of the woodwork institute said some proposals
rejected by city officials would have been suitable. ``They
couldn't make up their minds what to do with it,'' he said.
   A city crane helped workers take apart the 36-foot-tall temple
bearing the motto ``In union the fabric stands firm.'' It will be
stored at a suburban warehouse, repaired and eventually _ its
creators hope _ turned over to someone who will display it.
   ``We silly people would like to keep it in Philadelphia,'' said
Leon Clemmer, president of the Carpenters' Company, a social
organization rooted in a powerful 18th-century craft guild that
built the original edifice.
   Topped by a plaster statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of
agriculture, the float was pulled through rainy streets by eight
gray draft horses during the 1987 parade.
   Its troubles, however, began hours after the parade when Ceres
was toppled by some overhead wires.
   Crippled, it was parked across from the southeast corner of City
Hall.
   Merchants complained, so it was moved to a construction site a
block away and then to the city parking lot where it stood until
Thursday.
   Finally, with the float's seams splitting and molding rotting,
Clemmer asked the city to give it back.

<HEAD>House Passes Legislation to End US Trusteeship Over Palau</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Thursday passed legislation
designed to end the United States' trusteeship over Palau, the last
western Pacific island nation still covered by the trusteeships set
up by the United Nations in 1947.
   The bill, sent to the Senate by a 406-11 vote, would authorize
the president to enter into a compact of free association with
Palau once the Micronesian nation of 14,000 people approves the
plan.
   U.S. officials have told Congress that Palau is a strategically
important area that could host U.S. military and naval bases if a
new defense basing agreement cannot be worked out with the
Philippines.
   Under the proposed compact, the United States would gain basing
rights in Palau and would be responsible for defending the islands.
   The future of the legislation was uncertain as Congress worked
toward adjournment next week.
   A Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee aide, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said key members of the panel are
opposed to the plan drafted by the House Interior Committee's
insular and territorial affairs subcommittee.
   The aide said the main problem involves about $40 million in
assistance to Palau proposed by the House in addition to the $460
million in aid over 15 years that was contained in 1986 legislation
approving the proposed compact.
   Senators are taking the position that the 1986 agreement between
the House and Senate on the compact-approval bill still stands and
that if Palau wants more money, it can return later to Congress,
according to the aide.
   House committee leaders, including Chairman Morris Udall,
D-Ariz., and Ron de Lugo, the delegate from the Virgin Islands,
have quoted Palau officials as saying the extra $40 million is
needed to ensure compact approval by Palau voters.
   Palauans have held six plebiscites since 1982, but each has
fallen short of approving the free association arrangement that is
similar to ones the United States has with two other former trust
territories, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of
Micronesia.
   The problem in Palau is that nation's constitutional prohibition
against nuclear weapons on its territory. Each plebiscite has won a
majority but came up short of the 75 percent support needed to
overrule the no-nukes provision.
   The compact process has seen the killing of one Palau president,
the recent suicide of another, deep political divisions, reports of
intimidation and harassment of compact opponents and allegations of
governmental corruption.
   The extra money proposed by Udall and de Lugo would pay for
anti-drug programs and special auditors to monitor the Palau
government. Their bill also would authorize Palau to use $28
million in compact funds to help pay off a controversial power
plant that figured prominently in corruption allegations.

   This news story can tell your age.
   You're 50 or older if these words move you to memories of
staring at a mahogany box and hearing:
   _ ``Tain't funny, McGee.''
   _ ``Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. North America and all the ships
at sea. Let's go to press!''
   _ ``The house lights are being dimmed. In a moment, the great
gold curtain will go up.''
   _ ``Hi-yoo, Silver, awaaaay!''
   That, of course, was radio _ radio in its primest time, the
1940s and 1950s, when cities would fall silent and a visitor
strolling the tree-lined streets of middle America, on a summer's
evening, could catch, without missing a beat, the 15-minute drama
of Amos 'n' Andy pouring out of living room windows. In the
Depression years, one-third of a nation tuned in.
   A nostalgia-bathed exhibit opening Friday at the Smithsonian
Institution's National Portrait Gallery recalls the pioneers of
radio and television and the programs that generations of Americans
tuned in on and grew up with.
   The show's curator is Amy Henderson, a historian of the 19th
century who got her doctorate in Jefferson studies. She is a baby
boomer, and, although she thinks she remembers ``The Shadow''
(``Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?''), her earliest
firm memories are of television's Kuklapolitans and of the men in
gas station attendants' uniforms who used to bring on Milton Berle.
   ``It is nostalgia to you,'' she told a visitor 10 years her
senior. ``But it's history to me.''
   Off and on for five years, Ms. Henderson scoured the closets of
broadcasters for artifacts. She put the show together with help
from New York's Museum of Broadcasting. It will run through Jan. 2.
   The exhibit's museological purpose is not to wallow but ``to
trace the impact of radio and television personalities on American
culture'' from the turn of the century to the Kennedy-Nixon debate.
The museum says the inventions of radio and television are about as
important as Columbus' landing in the New World.
   Visitors will watch televisions giving snippets of early
broadcasts, such as Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, paired up for
the first time to cover the 1956 political conventions. They stayed
together to serve up the news for many years. Their signoff _
``Good night, Chet.'' ``Good night, David.'' _ became a national
coda, recited in schoolyards.
   There's familiar stuff here. A boyish Brinkley drily comments,
in a 1956 snippet, that the delegates did not clear the aisles when
the chair asked them to clear the aisles. No doubt, he made the
same observation this summer, eight pairs of conventions later.
   Dave Garroway is there, too, at the first ``Today'' show, with
J. Fred Muggs, a chimpanzee who bit everyone. His palm upraised,
Garroway signs off again saying ``Peace.'' In 1952, television at 7
a.m. was a radical idea.
   The exhibit offers artifacts of broadcasting: a Kate Smith gown,
a Howdy Doody puppet, Rudy Vallee's megaphone, Sid Caesar's German
Professor costume, a bejeweled Liberace outfit, Garroway's bowtie.
It's a clip-on.
   Radio buffs get to see what they did not need to see _
photographs of those who widened their world. They get to see the
device that created an awful racket when Fibber McGee reached for
the door to the hall closet at 79 Wistful Vista, and millions of
Americans, at their radios, tensed. What made that noise of a
closetful of possessions falling atop Fibber was a chicken-wire
covered barrel, churned by a sound effects man.
   Fibber's wife, Molly, would respond, ``Tain't funny, McGee,''
and people everywhere chuckled because it was funny.
   As for those other catchlines of radio:
   _ ``Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. North America and all the ships
at sea.'' That was Walter Winchell, the inventor of the gossip
column, signing on for 15 minutes of frenzied chatter, his finger
clattering a telegraph key between items, and hot news introduced
with a barked ``Flash!'' Twenty million people tuned in.
   _ ``The house lights are being dimmed.'' That would be Milton
Cross, introducing the Metropolitan Opera to a nationwide audience,
most members of whom probably never would see the inside of an
opera house. His virtuoso performance, every Saturday afternoon for
45 seasons, demonstrated the democratization of culture that radio
made possible.
   _ ``Hi-yoo, Silver, awaaaay!'' With that fading call, the Lone
Ranger, who fought evil in the old West with silver bullets,
galloped off. He and his ever-faithful Indian companion, Tonto,
played on radio for 2,956 episodes, from Jan. 30, 1933, to Sept. 3,
1954. They lasted on television from 1949 until 1957.
   Many entertainers couldn't make the move to the new medium.
   Funnyman Fred Allen was one who flopped on television. ``On a
radio broadcast, anything goes,'' he told Life magazine. ``You can
have a man walking up the side of a building like a spider. You
merely plant a suggestion in the listener's mind and his
imagination supplies all the details, all the scenery, props,
extras and costumes.''
   But, as for television, said the acerbic Allen: ``They call
television a medium because nothing on it is ever well done.''

   Calvin Graham said Thursday that a weight was
lifted from his heart when the House voted to give him back pay and
benefits denied by the Navy because he lied about his age and
enlisted during World War II when he was only 12.
   But Graham, who was injured aboard the USS South Dakota during
the battle of Guadalcanal, says he's still crossing his fingers
that the legislation will clear the Senate before it adjourns for
the year _ possibly as soon as next week.
   ``It's not that much money,'' he said from his home in Fort
Worth, Texas. ``It's the pride of the thing to me _ that would be
worth a lot to me.''
   Graham was discharged from the military 45 years ago when he
returned from the Pacific and was thrown into the brig because of
his age.
   Graham was denied his mustering out benefits and was granted
disability status for one tooth, although he claims he lost all of
his teeth after shrapnel ripped through his mouth at Guadalcanal.
   The legislation, approved on a unanimous voice vote Tuesday in
the House, would compensate Graham with $18,000 for his mouth
injury and give him mustering out benefits of $4,917.
   The military in 1980 offered to give Graham back pay and
mustering out benefits of $337 _ what he would have received upon
his discharge in 1943. But Rep. Martin Frost and House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, worked to get Graham compensated in 1988 dollars,
with interest.
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, meanwhile, is attempting to get the
Senate to act quickly on Graham's behalf and has asked Sen. Howell
T. Heflin, D-Ala., to help move the bill out of the Senate
Judiciary subcommittee that he chairs.
   The Navy in 1978 granted Graham an honorable discharge, Bentsen
said.
   Graham's story was the subject of a CBS television movie, ``Too
Young the Hero,'' earlier this year, and Frost said he believes the
publicity finally stirred Congress into acting. The bill had been
introduced four or five times previously.
   Graham rejoined the service when he reached the proper age and
served with the Marines during the Korean War. He is now confined
to a wheelchair from injuries suffered during a fall from a pier in
California years ago.

<HEAD>Chinese-Soviet Likely; Gorbachev To Visit North Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will probably meet
with Chinese leaders early next year and also plans to visit North
Korea, the Kremlin said Thursday.
   Igor A. Rogachev, deputy foreign minister in charge of contacts
with China, was asked whether a Soviet-Chinese summit would follow
a meeting this year between the two foreign ministers, and whether
the summit would occur in the first half of 1989 as Chinese reports
have indicated.
   ``My sense is that one might be in a position to suggest that
both would be the case,'' Rogachev replied at a news conference.
   Moscow and Beijing have been at odds since the 1960s. Nikita S.
Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung held the last summit in 1959.
   Gorbachev has taken several actions that opened the way to
better relations, including withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from
Afghanistan, reducing troop strength on the Chinese border and
agreeing in August to the first direct talks with China about
Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.
   Foreign Minister Qian Quichen of China met with the Soviet
foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, last month and plans to
visit Moscow later this year, but no date has been set. Rogachev
said Cambodia, where the Soviet Union supports Vietnam's
occupation, will be high on the agenda.
   Rogachev has represented the Kremlin in the talks with China on
Cambodia.
   He did not say whether Gorbachev would travel to Beijing or
Chinese leaders would visit Moscow. Gorbachev broached the idea of
a summit in a speech Sept. 16 in Siberia.
   On Thursday, Rogachev told reporters the Kremlin hopes relations
with China can be based on ``friendship and good-neighborliness.''
   Gorbachev's visit to North Korea will fulfill a commitment made
by Andrei A. Gromyko. Soviet news reports Sept. 26 said Gromyko
would visit North Korea as the Soviet president in the first 10
days of October.
   Gromyko was retired from the presidency and the ruling Communist
Party Politburo last week, however, and Gorbachev was elected
president.
   Rogachev told the news conference Gorbachev has a standing
invitation to visit North Korea and expects to do so but has not
set a date.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Genital Warts Are Epidemic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A virus is causing an epidemic of
genital warts and appears to underlie the rise in cervical cancer,
a doctor said at a science writers' meeting.
   ``It is now clear that transmission of these viral agents has
reached epidemic proportions,'' Dr. Gary Schoolnik, an associate
professor at the Stanford University Medical Center, said Wednesday
at the meeting held by the American Medical Association.
   The infection, known as papilloma virus, is a group of 46
viruses that cause warts. Of the dozen or more of the viruses that
cause genital warts, five have been firmly linked to pre-cancerous
changes in cervical cells. The cervix is the opening of the uterus.
   The five viruses are often missed by traditional pap smear
examinations.
   But, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve a
test within weeks that detects the virus with far greater accuracy
and can determine when a very dangerous form of the virus is
present, Schoolnik said.
   Genital papilloma virus infections are the most common sexually
transmitted disease in many communities, more frequent than
syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and herpes, he said.
   Schoolnik called the infection ``the sexually transmitted
disease of the '90s,'' following herpes in the '70s and deadly AIDS
in the '80s.
   The rate of genital warts has increased six fold in the past 10
years, he said.
   A survey of San Francisco Bay area adolescent clinics found that
20 percent of sexually active girls between 14 and 18 years old
were infected by the virus, said Schoolnik, who conducted the
survey.
   Last year, 14,000 American women were diagnosed with cervical
cancer, which can be cured if detected early but is fatal if left
untreated.

   A woman who claimed her $10 million
Florida Lotto jackpot on Thursday said the money will give her a
sense of security but she has no plans to quit her job.
   Elynor Purcell, 67, said she went to work Sunday, the day after
the jackpot drawing, at the turnstiles at the Calder Race Course
clubhouse and waited until Monday to tell her neighbor.
   ``I woke my friend Judy up and told her. I guess it was about 10
after eight so it was a little early for her,'' Mrs. Purcell said
during a news conference. ``She said, `If you came up here at this
hour of the morning there must be something wrong,' and I said
`Yeah, I'm rich.' I think I started to tear up a little bit.''
   Mrs. Purcell, 67, moved to Florida from near Pottsville, Pa., in
1959. She has lived in Miramar for about 12 years. She said she has
stepchildren living in Pennsylvania but didn't say how many or
where they lived.
   When she correctly picked the six winning numbers last week, the
jackpot had been advertised at $9 million, but it was boosted to
$10.04 million by vigorous sales, which means she will collect
$502,000 a year for 20 years.
   She also has won the daily numbers game, called CASH 3, three
times since it started in January, said lottery Secretary Rebecca
Paul.
   Ms. Paul also announced that this week's Lotto jackpot has been
boosted from $8 million to $10 million because sales of the $1
tickets were even with last week's.
   Mrs. Purcell said she didn't have any system for picking her
winning numbers, which were 16, 20, 27, 31, 40 and 41.
   She has no specific plans for spending the money.
   ``It's a little early to decide that now,'' she said. ``It will
probably give me a sense of security since I will be able to
collect this for 20 years.''

   Zhangjian Chen, 37, and a colleague, Lilly You, 32, became ill
Sept. 16 after eating soup the two had prepared from mushrooms they
had gathered at the New Canaan Nature Center.
   You, who ate less soup, was released Sept. 26 from Stamford
Hospital. Chen was transferred to Hartford Hospital two weeks ago

   The pair had been invited to this country by a New Jersey
textbook company and had spent time visiting libraries. They were
visiting an acquaintance in Darien when they became ill.

<TEXT>
   An exultant Lloyd Bentsen flew home to
Texas Thursday, taking new jibes at Dan Quayle's need for ``job
training'' while accepting fellow Democrats' accolades for his
performance against Quayle in the vice presidential debate.
   ``Last night, the eyes of Texas and the whole nation were on
you, and they liked what they saw,'' Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis told Bentsen before a cheering crowd in
this rural East Texas community.
   Bentsen and Dukakis, who usually campaign separately, united for
the joint post-debate rally. Bentsen normally introduces Dukakis
when they do appear together, but Bentsen followed Dukakis to the
microphones this time.
   ``After listening to Dan Quayle last night, I can understand why
he kept talking about job training,'' Bentsen said, getting a roar
from the 2,500 people in a lakeside park.
   Across the lake was a steel factory that he said has lost
thousands of jobs to foreign competition. Bentsen said the
Republicans don't want to talk about that.
   ``My friends, if you don't speak of these concerns, you're
endangering America,'' he said.
   The Texas senator appeared elated by poll figures suggesting
most television viewers thought he won the debate.
   ``Gee, those polls were great, weren't they?'' he told reporters
traveling with his campaign. ``Well, I knew I scored some points,
and I thought I was winning, but it's difficult to be objective
about yourself.''
   The Dukakis campaign planned to take advantage of what they felt
was a clear Bentsen debate victory by airing new television spots
questioning Quayle's qualifications for the presidency, said Dayton
Duncan, Dukakis' press secretary.
   The flash point of Wednesday night's debatge came when Bentsen
told Quayle he was ``no Jack Kennedy.'' Bentsen acknowledged that
the topic had been raised during his preparations, but denied his
answer was a ``canned'' response.
   ``What happened there was Quayle kept comparing himself with
Kennedy, just overreaching himself, and I got fed up with it,'' he
said. ``I deeply resented him trying to put Kennedy's mantle over
himself when he didn't have a record that compared with Kennedy.''
   Democratic party chairman Paul Kirk, who traveled to Texas with
Bentsen, said he was surprised Quayle compared himself with
Kennedy, even though the Indiana senator had done so on the
campaign trail before.
   ``It was so transparent I didn't think he had the gall to bring
it up,'' he said. But once that happened, ``he was fair game,''
Kirk said, dismissing Republican complaints that Bentsen was mean.
   Bentsen and Kennedy were elected to Congress together in 1948.
Bentsen served three terms in the House before dropping out of
politics for 16 years to pursue a business career.
   The debate reinforced the doubts many people had about Quayle,
Bentsen contended.
   ``The polls show that those that were concerned about his
qualifications for the presidency had that buttressed by the
debates last night,'' he said.
   He disputed Quayle's contention that the debate showed Bentsen
running away from Dukakis.
   ``No, I came to his defense many, many times. I talked about how
proud I was to be on the ticket with him,'' he said.
   After days of tension, Bentsen was relaxed and chatted with
reporters at length on the campaign jet. Among other things, he
listed what he would do if he suddenly had to take the reins of
power _ including quick action to make sure the Soviets didn't try
to take advantage of a U.S. crisis.
   Quayle has been criticized by Democrats for failing to give a
detailed answer when asked that question several times during the
debate.
   Bentsen said one of the last things he did before heading to the
hall on Wednesday night was to gather his wife and children in his
hotel suite and pray. He wouldn't say what he did afterward to
celebrate, except to say there were ``a lot of hugs.''
   After the Lone Star rally, Bentsen was flying to Dallas, where
he planned private meetings, a fund-raiser, and rest. He then
planned to campaign through Saturday almost entirely in Texas,
where the Democrats still trail despite his presence on the ticket.

<TEXT>
   Members of John F. Kennedy's inner circle
enthusiastically agreed Thursday with Lloyd Bentsen that Dan Quayle
is ``no Jack Kennedy.'' But they gave less support to the Texas
senator's own claim of friendship with the late president.
   Lawrence F. O'Brien, who worked for Kennedy in the 1960
presidential campaign and later in the White House, said he found
Quayle's effort to compare himself to the late president ``both
laughable and pathetic.''
   Quayle can cite age, family wealth, years in Congress, and
political ambition to support his claim that his experience is
similar to Kennedy's when the Massachusetts senator ran for
president 28 years ago.
   But when he drew the comparison during the vice presidential
debate Wednesday night, Bentsen quickly retorted:
   ``I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy
was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
   Republicans, jumping to Quayle's defense, branded Bentsen's
remark ``a cheap shot,'' while Democrats denounced Quayle's
``audacity'' for comparing himself to the late president.
   ``I agree with Bentsen,'' said former Kennedy speechwriter
Richard Goodwin. ``I have a feeling it was a pretty widespread
sentiment.''
   Goodwin said, ``I don't suppose the number of years in Congress
makes an awful lot of difference. It's a question ofwhat you've
done with them and what kind of human being you are. ... Kennedy
happened to be a much more intelligent, better-informed human
being.''
   O'Brien, when asked if he recalled any close relationship
between Kennedy and Bentsen, said the Texan ``was considered by us
a friend.''
   However, Goodwin said, ``I don't recall them being quite that
friendly. ... I'm sure he knew him and they worked together.''
   The research section at the Kennedy Library in Boston said files
of White House correspondence between Kennedy and Bentsen, who was
in private business in Texas while Kennedy was president, turned up
only routine requests for autographed pictures.
   Much of Kennedy's correspondence from the period when he and
Bentsen served together in the House was missing, a researcher said.
   Historian James MacGregor Burns said Kennedy ``has come to be a
kind of landmark president'' still revered by Americans even though
he served less than three years before he was assassinated.
   ``His image was always so sharp and compelling that it lingers
in the national memory,'' he said.
   That may explain why Republicans cite Kennedy about as often as
Democrats do.
   Turning to the Quayle comparison with Kennedy, Burns said,
``Literally, their careers are comparable. But the big difference
was that Jack Kennedy, probably because of his father and good luck
and so on, had been involved in national and international politics
for years.
   ``For example, he had been speaking up against colonialism, much
to the annoyance of the Truman and Eisenhower administrations.''
   Kennedy's father had been U.S. ambassador to Great Britain and
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   Goodwin also cited what he called the ``extraordinary'' way that
Kennedy's memory has been ``resilient and enduring.''
   ``It's partly a mystery, but somehow Kennedy became symbolic of
the American's last idealized picture of America as young,
adventurous, headed towards greatness, great purpose, all the rest
of it,'' he said.
   When he spoke to a sixth grade class recently in Maine, said
Goodwin, ``all they wanted to ask about was Kennedy.''

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres was
jostled, booed and called a traitor Thursday as he campaigned for
undecided voters in this traditional stronghold of the conservative
Likud Bloc.
   ``Peres go home!'' chanted scores of Likud supporters dressed in
blue-and-white party hats and waving Likud banners at the
65-year-old Peres as he entered an open-air vegetable market.
   They taunted Peres for conciliatory policies toward the Arabs,
especially his proposal to trade parts of the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip for peace.
   The crowd of about 400 surged toward Peres, who was knocked off
balance several times but unharmed. Police linked arms to protect
Peres, and security guards grabbed a man who tried to hurl a tomato.
   The Labor leader told The Associated Press: ``It demonstrates a
certain style that a better part of the Israeli people do not like
to see.''
   The crowd was made up mostly of young Sephardim, or Jews whose
familes immigrated from Middle East countries and who now account
for a slight majority of Israel's 3.4 million Jews. They voted
heavily for Likud in the 1977 elections and ended 29 years of rule
by the Labor Party, which was dominated by Askenazi Jews
originating from Europe.
   In a meeting with party workers, Peres acknowledged that the
working-class town of 37,000 residents, including 5,300 Arabs, had
been a Likud stronghold but said ``we hope to change that.''
   Peres then set out on a 90-minute walk down Herzl Street, the
main commercial throughfare. He sought out voters who said they had
not made up their minds or who had voted for Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's Likud Bloc in the past.
   Independent pollsters estimate the undecided account for more
than 20 percent of the electorate and could determine the outcome
of the Nov. 1 balloting.
   To retirees, housewives, shopowners and the unemployed his
message was the same: keeping the West Bank and Gaza Strip would
mean annexing a large Palestinian balance that would threaten the
Jewish nature of the state.
   ``We mustn't lose the Jewish majority in Israel. If the Likud
wins, there will be an Arab majority. Shamir doesn't want a
Palestinian state, but he will bring one about,'' Peres argued.
   He noted 3.5 million Jews and 2.4 million Arabs already lived in
Israeli-held territory and the populations would be nearly equal
early next century.
   At one point, Peres stopped a housewife in her 20s and persuaded
her to put out a cigarette she was smoking. ``I smoked for 40
years, but I quit and now I feel much better,'' said Peres, a
reformed three-pack-a-day puffer.
   But he had more difficulty in getting her vote. The woman said
she had been forced to leave her home in the Sinai Desert when the
land was returned to Egypt.
   ``Because of the territories, it's difficult for me to vote for
Labor,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Four senators on Thursday asked an independent
committee to review safety and operations at the Savannah River
Plant, a South Carolina facility that produces nuclear weapons
material.
   The plant, run by E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. under contract
from the Energy Department, has come under increasing scrutiny
since disclosures last week that as many as 30 major mishaps there
over three decades had not been reported to department headquarters
or disclosed to the public.
   The alleged questionable safety and operating procedures,
detailed in internal documents from Du Pont and the department,
continued until this August, when the latest incident caused
engineers to shut down the P-Reactor at the plant. The facility's
other two reactors also have been shut down.
   ``We are very concerned about both the August 1988 incident at
P-Reactor and earlier incidents discussed in a recently disclosed
1985 Du Pont memorandum,'' said the letter, signed by Sens. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C.; James McClure, R-Idaho; Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.
   They called for an investigation by the Advisory Committee on
Nuclear Facilities Safety, which is headed John F. Ahearne and was
established by Energy Secretary John Herrington to give independent
assessments of operations at nuclear facilities.
   Ahearne expressed concern over the failure of Du Pont and Energy
Department officials to notify him during the August incident,
according to detailed report on the mishap released Thursday by the
department.
   The report concluded that despite a power pulse, ``there was no
accident, no near-miss, and the reactor was not out of control.''
   ``The decision was made to shut down P-Reactor, a strategic
defense facility, even though no imminent safety hazard was
present,'' said the report, prepared by a committee headed by J.
Phil Hamric, assistant manager for projects at the Energy
Department.
   The report found that engineers starting P-Reactor on Aug. 7
miscalculated the amount of xenon and tritium in the reactor and
used an unorthodox method of adjusting two of the rods used to
control the nuclear reaction. The reactor experienced a small power
pulse, or ``blip,'' the next day.
   The reactor was shut down on Aug. 17 under orders from officials
of the Energy Department and Du Pont at Savannah River.
   A detailed analysis disclosed that ``two full weak control rods
(35A and 53F) were found to be at their full up position when they
should have been fully inserted,'' the Hamric report said. ``No
reason nor accurate time for the occurrence was annotated in the
operating logs.''
   As a fix, operators ``drove rods 35A and 53F back to their
original positions by using ... a device for positioning single
rods by bypassing their normal control signal path,'' the report
said.
   `A concise and clear log entry was not made,'' it said. ``Such
joint movement of control rods had never previously been seen by
this operating shift, but restart continued normally.''
   A spokesman for Du Pont said company officials had not yet seen
the Hamric report but have moved to correct some of the
deficiencies.
   ``Some of these problems have been identified,'' spokesman Clif
Webb said. ``We have been thinking about making these changes for
some time.''
   Ahearne, head of the independent committee, was informed of the
unusual procedures not by Du Pont or Energy Department officials,
but by a newspaper reporter who called him on Aug. 16, the report
said, and he ``was surprised to learn of the situation at Savannah
River.''
   The following morning, Ahearne sent a request by telecopier
asking du Pont and Energy Department officials at Savannah River
for full information, the report said.
   Ahearne was out his office Thursday and did not respond to
inquiries from The Associated Press.

   The Reagan administration responded quickly
and with jubilation Thursday to the vote in Chile to reject
President Augusto Pinochet's bid to extend his 15-year rule.
   But the head of a private research group said the margin of
victory for the general`s opponents _ 54.7 percent to 43 percent _
was too narrow to finish him off politically.
   ``The old fox is in good shape,'' said Larry Birns, director of
the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. He said the Christian
Democratic and Socialist opposition is divided, and that Pinochet
could run in next year's election and defeat separate candidates.
   ``The opposition did not crush Pinochet,'' Birns said in an
interview.``Those on the extreme left and the extreme right
probably will resume violent activities, which were suspended for
the period of the election. This could produce a situation where
Pinochet can say the chaos I predicted is returning to Chile and
the state of emergency has to be reimposed.''
   The State Department and the White House, however, voiced
pleasure with the way the referendum was conducted and appeared to
bless the results, as well.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the voting was ``an important
step toward democracy.''
   She also praised the Pinochet government for accepting the
results.
   ``We congratulate the people of Chile for having given the world
such an impressive demonstration of the power of the ballot box,''
Mrs. Oakley said. ``They turned out in exceptionally high numbers
and took part in an exemplary voting process which they helped
administer.''
   Her statement also credited the Chilean armed forces with
protecting the polling places and said they had guaranteed order
``in an admirable manner.''
   Mrs. Oakley called on Pinochet's supporters and opponents to
work together to build ``a new national consensus.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration was ``pleased with the process ... of the plebiscite
and we congratulate the Chilean people on carrying this forth.''
   The spokesman refused to comment on the results directly,
saying, ``We won't comment on individual Chileans and who won or
lost _ but we think they are on the right track.''
   ``We welcome the democratic process and we hope that it will be
carried out peacefully and effectively in the next year,'' he added.
   Asked if the administration believed that Pinochet would move
toward democratic elections, the spokesman said of the Chilean
president, ``He's indicated he will accept it and work toward
elections a year from now, and we hope that's the case.''
   The elections would be held in December 1989. Had Pinochet won
the referendum he could have remained in office until 1997.
   Before the balloting, the Reagan administration and Harry G.
Barnes Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Santiago, did not disguise their
distaste for Pinochet.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met last week in New York
with Foreign Minister Ricardo Garcia and underscored that the
United States favored a free and fair election.
   On Monday, the State Department registered concern that the
government would interfere with the balloting. On Tuesday, Mrs.
Oakley said the department had received and welcomed assurances
from Chile that the outcome of the plebiscite would be respected.
   Meanwhile, Barnes, who will end his assignment in November, told
The New York Times in an interview in Santiago on Monday that he
would leave happier if Pinochet were defeated in the plebiscite.
   ``I look forward to coming back in March 1990, when the first
democratically elected president would be inaugurated, if the `No'
wins, rather than having to wait until 1997,'' the 62-year-old
ambassador was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan celebrated German-American
Day Thursday with a call for the removal of the Berlin Wall, which
he called ``a horrendous scar,'' dividing East and West Germany.
   Reagan, in remarks to a gathering of U.S. and West German
officials in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, hailed the
``shared principles of democracy and liberty'' that have sustained
the two allies for 40 years.
   ``Unfortunately, for Germans as well as Americans, a horrendous
scar continues to mar the hopes and prospects of a united Germany,
free of totalitarian shackles,'' Reagan said.
   The president called the post-World War II division of Germany,
symbolized by the Berlin Wall, a ``cruel and unnatural division.''
   ``The wall ... stands as a gash dividing those who hope, and
those who despair, and those who are free to do as they may, and
those who do only what the state will allow,'' the president said.
   ``Once again, I implore those in the East to remove this stain
on human decency,'' he said. ``Release those bonds and some day
there will be one united and free Germany. And the United States
will be even further enriched by the great German people.''

   A black teen-ager who suffered racial slurs
and found insults painted on her locker after she forced the
cancellation of a class ``slave auction'' was attending a new
school on Thursday.
   Charrise Williams, 17, transferred from Temple Heights Christian
School, where she found her locker defaced with the words ``Support
KKK'' and other epithets. She began attending King High School on
Monday.
   ``I didn't want to stay in a place I wasn't wanted,'' said
Charrise, a senior, but added, ``If I could do it all over again I
would.''
   The controversy started when she called for an end to Temple
Heights' annual slave auction, a popular fund-raiser for seniors at
the predominantly white school of 750 students, which is run by the
First Baptist Church of Temple Heights.
   Students were supposed to wear clown costumes and be auctioned
off to the highest bidder. The purchased ``slave'' would spend the
next day doing minor chores for the buyer. The auction, which has
been conducted for 15 years, generally raises $1,000 to $1,500.
   Charrise, one of three blacks in the 45-member senior class,
protested the event, sayiould get better.''

<HEAD>Israel Will Vaccinate All Residents Under 40 Against Polio</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Health officials will vaccinate every Israeli
up to the age of 40 against polio following an outbreak of the
disease that affected at least nine people, the Health Ministry
announced Thursday.
   About 3.2 million residents will be innoculated, and the program
should be completed in a month, ministry spokesman Shmuel Algrabli
said. It will cost about $3.1 million.
   ``We hope this will help to calm people down,'' Algrabli said.
``We are calling on the public not to panic and not to try to be
innoculated privately. There is enough vaccine in the country for
everyone.''
   The government undertook the campaign after hearing
recommendations from a team of international health experts called
to Israel for consultations after nine patients were diagnosed with
polio, Algrabli said. There are another three unconfirmed cases of
the disease, he said.
   The outbreak of polio, thought to be wiped out in the country,
was a surprise to Israelis, who are innoculated rountinely as
infants. The new vaccination is an additional booster.
   Polio is an infectious disease caused by a virus inflammation of
the gray matter of the spinal cord. It is accompanied by paralysis
of various muscle groups.
   Just weeks before the Israeli polio cases were reported last
month, the European World Health Organization, to which Israel
belongs, was considering declaring the disease eradicated in the
region.
   No cases were reported in Israel last year and only one case was
reported in 1986. The recent cases have been blamed on overflowing
sewage.
   Israel's health officials are now considering changing the
method of routine childhood vaccination from the live-virus Sabin
to a combined innoculation of Sabin and the dead-virus Salk
vaccine. No final decision has been made, Algrabli said.
   Since the polio was first identified last month, about 500,000
Israelis have already received a booster vaccination, Algrabli said
They include residents of affected areas and all soldiers in the
army.
   The next stage of the innoculations will start Friday in the
northern towns of Acre and in the Rehovot area, where the polio
virus was found in sewage.
   A separate series of tests will determine whether the boosters
should be administered in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Algrabli said. He said tourists planning to visit Israel do not
need to be innoculated.

<HEAD>ACLU Head Says Bush Could Unleash Attacks On Civil Liberties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the American Civil Liberties Union
said Thursday that George Bush's attacks on the organization and
the issues it supports show the vice president has aligned himself
with the ``darkest forces'' in the nation.
   Bush's criticism of the ACLU demonstrates he is ``willing to
toy'' with Americans' civil liberties that are protected by the
Bill of Rights, said Ira Glasser, executive director of the ACLU's
national chapter.
   While the ACLU is used to criticism, the group ``doesn't expect
that kind of nonsense from a major candidate,'' Glasser said at a
luncheon.
   ``He has aligned himself with the darkest forces,'' Glasser
said, adding that Bush's comments reflect his ignorance of the
ACLU's mission.
   Bush, in trying to paint his Democratic opponent, Michael
Dukakis, as a far-out liberal, has cited Dukakis' long-time
membership in the ACLU. In his first debate with Dukakis last
month, Bush said: ``I don't agree with a lot of, most of the
positions of the ACLU.''
   Though Bush's criticism of the ACLU has prompted an outpouring
of spontaneous support for the group, Glasser said he feared Bush's
expressions could create a climate of fear in which it was
acceptable to attack civil liberties.
   While Dukakis has expressed his support for civil liberties,
Glasser said he was disappointed that the Massachusetts governor
failed to vigorously defend the ACLU in the televised debate
between the two presidential candidates.
   ``Bush attacked Dukakis and Dukakis tried to hide,'' Glasser
said.
   The ACLU, Glasser said, is a non-partisan group with 250,000. It
supports the rights of Americans whose constitutionally guaranteed
freedoms are under attack.

   Anti-government guerrillas fired rockets at an
Afghan city, hitting a hospital and killing dozens of people, Tass
reported Thursday.
   The Soviet news agency, quoting its Afghan counterpart Bakhtar,
said three patients and a nurse were killed in the attack Wednesday
and that the hospital in the city of Kandagar was damaged.
   Also Wednesday, a mine planted by terrorists tore apart a bus in
Nangarhar province. Twenty-three passengers were killed and 13
seriously injured, Tass said.
   On Thursday, a rocket attack killed a woman and her four
children in their house in the city of Charinkara in Parvan
province.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told reporters
at a Moscow news briefing Soviet troops had broken a guerrilla
blockade of the city of Paghman in Kabul province. He said the
siege was ended after several days of fighting.
   On Wednesday, Tass reported that guerrillas fired more than two
dozen rockets into the Afghan capital, Kabul, during rush hour,
killing 13 people and wounding 34.
   The Soviet Union said last week it had halted the withdrawal of
its more than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan because of alleged
Pakistani and U.S. violations of the Geneva accords. Under the
accord signed April 14, the Kremlin agreed to withdraw its soldiers
in exchange for a pledge by Pakistan and the United States not to
meddle in Afghanistan's affairs. Half of the Soviet forces were
withdrawn between May 15 and Aug. 15, and the rest are to be out by
Feb. 15.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
Kabul government fight a nationwide Moslem insurgency.

<TEXT>
   A judge in a freedom-of-the-press case has
barred any mention of a lawyer's ACLU membership in front of the
jury because of the criticism the organization has received during
the presidential campaign.
   U.S. District Judge William Beatty issued the ruling Monday at
the request of lawyers for Brian Lunn, who contends he was punished
by his high school in 1987 for attacking the school's drug policy
in the student newspaper.
   The trial began this week.
   Jay Miller, executive director of the ACLU's Chicago office,
said Thursday that to his knowledge, it was the first case in which
the issue had arisen.
   Lunn, who is seeking $200,000 in damages from Collinsville High
School, is represented by Jane Whicher of the American Civil
Liberties Union and Sharon Knapp.
   In a pre-trial motion, Knapp asked that the ACLU's involvement
be kept secret, citing Vice President George Bush's derisive
characterization of Michael Dukakis as a ``card-carrying member of
the ACLU.''
   ``Any reference to the ACLU may well be inflammatory and-or
prejudicial,'' the motion said.
   ``At the very least, there is the potential that jurors' views
about the ACLU as an organization may draw their attention from the
issues and parties in this case.''
   Lunn contends he was suspended from school and removed as editor
for writing editorials, publishing cartoons and leading a rally
critical of a requirement that students participating in
extracurricular activities sign an agreement to refrain from
drinking, taking drugs or otherwise breaking the law.
   School administrators on Wednesday testified Lunn's opposition
had nothing to do with the punishment.
   Lunn is a sophomore at the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana.

<HEAD>Maryland Crime Victim To Tape Ad For California GOP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Maryland man attacked by a convicted murderer
on furlough from a Massachusetts prison said Thursday he will
recount his experience in advertisements for a pro-George Bush
group in California.
   Cliff Barnes said he has agreed to tape radio ads this weekend
for the Committee for the Presidency. Barnes said he isn't sure
whether his wife, Angi, who was raped by the attacker, would
accompany him.
   Barnes and his then-fiance, of Oxon Hill, Md., were attacked in
April 1987 by Willie Horton, who had fled Massachusetts while out
of prison under that state's furlough program. Horton broke into
Barnes' house, tied him up and slashed his stomach 22 times, then
beat up his fiance and raped her twice.
   Bush, in his Republican presidential campaign, has repeatedly
cited the incident to underscore his argument that Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, is soft on
crime.
   ``I'm not doing this for Bush,'' Barnes said in a telephone
interview from a Washington auto dealership where he is service
manager. ``I'm going for an independent committee. I volunteered.
This is not a case of someone exploiting victims. I want to get my
piece said.''
   While acknowledging that his agreement to tape the
advertisements was tantamount to a Bush endorsement, Barnes said,
``I'm not telling anyone who I'm voting for.
   ``This is not political. I would have the same problem with this
man (Dukakis) if he was running for plumber of the year,'' Barnes
said. ``It's unconscionable to me that this man (Dukakis) hasn't
even apologized to my wife. That's what's mobilizing me. He didn't
even drop me a line.''
   Barnes emphasized that he is not opposed to prison furlough
programs in general _ only those that release first-degree
murderers sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.
   Barnes said he understood the California group was composed of
conservatives from both major parties.
   However, the committee is an independent Republican campaign
started by Steve Garvey, the former star first baseman for the Los
Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, to help the Bush campaign.
   Barnes said he planned to leave Thursday for the West Coast, a
trip that will be paid for by the Committee for the Presidency. He
said he isn't sure whether his wife will travel with him, adding
that she is still haunted by the attack.
   Committee director Lee Stitzenberger said he expects the radio
ads will be used in the final weeks of the presidential campaign.
   Dukakis, who in March suspended the furlough program for
murderers serving life without parole, has attacked Bush for
politicizing the tragedy.
   ``This is an effort to use the one case with a tragic occurrence
for political reasons,'' Dukakis said in Boston. ``(Bush) knows
that the federal government has a very extensive furlough program,
knows that Governor Reagan in California in the '70s had a very
extensive furlough program and tragedies as a result of that.''

<HEAD>Congresswomen Push For Medicare Mammography Screenings</HEAD>

   The government should provide Medicare
reimbursement for the full costs of elderly women's mammography
screenings, the X-ray tests that can detect breast cancer early and
sharply reduce death rates, two congresswomen said Thursday.
   ``We need to promote preventive medicine, not just pay for care
once an illness has set in,'' said Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly,
D-Conn., a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.
   Mrs. Kennelly said the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act,
enacted into law earlier this year, included a $50 reimbursement
provision for the X-ray technique used to detect lesions within the
breast.
   ``A $50 mammogram is not readily available in the United
States,'' the congresswoman said. ``The average cost for a
mammogram ranges from $80 to $200.''
   Mrs. Kennelly said the only place women can receive mammograms
for $50 is mobile van clinics.
   ``Most women, especially older women, simply will not submit to
being examined by a stranger in a van in the parking lot of a
shopping mall,'' she said.
   ``Not only is a woman more likely to undergo the test when under
the care of someone she knows and with whom she is comfortable, but
doctors are more able to identify changes over time, and are able
to provide the analysis, counseling and follow-up that are
necessary to effectively care for patients,'' she said.
   A bill introduced by Mrs. Kennelly would remove the $50 cap,
making Medicare coverage for mammogram screenings the same as for
mammograms for women already diagnosed with breast cancer.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said introducing the
legislation now, near the end of the year's legislative session,
will help ``put it first in line so they can't shove it aside''
next year.
   The Office of Technology Assessment has estimated that screening
women over 65 could reduce the breast cancer mortality rate by 50
percent after five years, according to Mrs. Kennelly.
   ``Breast cancer took the lives of 45,000 women in 1987, of which
28,000 were over age 65. Many of those lives could have been saved
if mammograms were readily available and affordable to those
women,'' she said at a news conference.
   The American Cancer Society recommends that women over 40
undergo mammography screenings annually.

   Four Americans threw dollar bills
in the Mekong River Thursday and planned to direct a remote control
toy boat across to the Laotian side in efforts to free Americans
they believe are held in communist Indochina.
   The dollars, sealed in plastic envelopes, and the boat carry
offers of a $2.4 million reward for any American prisoner of war
brought out of Laos, Vietnam or Cambodia.
   Two members of the American group were captured by Laotian
authorities last Sunday when they hired a fishing boat at this
river town, dropped the bills into the Mekong and then went to a
Laotian village.
   Thai police said Donna Long, of Jacksonville, N.C., and James
Copp, of Hamstead, N.C., have been moved from the Laotian village
to the city of Pakse and possibly the Laotian capital of Vientiane.
   The remaining four members of the group on Thursday threw $25 to
$30 into the river, which flows on to Cambodia and Vietnam, as a
``test'' and planned to drop more than $2,000 in American and other
currencies Friday from the Thai shore.
   The boat, donated by a Florida toy manufacturer named Jim Rambo,
is to be steered by remote control to the Laotian shore and left
there. The speedy 2.5-foot boat is festooned with a flag reading
``You MIAs (missing in action) are not forgotten.''
   ``We are absolutely steadfast that this reward effort will
work,'' said Bruce Adams, of Laramie, Wyo., whose brother was
listed as MIA in Laos 22 years ago.
   The reward money has been pledged by 21 U.S. congressmen and
others in the United States and the information about it is being
disseminated by the National Steering Committee for American War
Veterans, one of a number of private American MIA-POW groups.
   ``We do not condone private forays. They have not proved helpful
and in many instances have proved counter-productive,`` said
Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. William J. Crowe,
Jr. when asked about the group's activities along the Mekong.
   Crowe, who was visiting Bangkok, said although the U.S.
government put very high priority on the MIA issue, ``we have not
as yet been able to confirm a single case where (reports of live
Americans in Indochina proved) true.''
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as MIA from the
Indochina war in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three Indochinese
governments deny holding live Americans and both Laos and Vietnam
are extending help to the U.S. government in resolving the issue.

   President Kennedy worried that leaks from Congress
about his military chiefs' testimony would scuttle the historic
nuclear test ban treaty, according to secret Oval Office tapes
released Thursday.
   The conversations involving Kennedy, his top advisers and Senate
leaders in the summer of 1963 show a president personally engaged
in the strategy, nose-counting and public relations required to
push a major treaty through the U.S. Senate.
   Kennedy's chief worry was that a hostile Senate subcommittee
would get the military brass to testify first in private, then
selectively leak portions of the testimony to suggest that the
military leaders had doubts.
   In the end, however, Kennedy steered the limited nuclear treaty
to an 80-19 vote and signed it in his office on Oct. 7, 1963,
exactly 25 years ago Friday. The anniversary prompted the Kennedy
Library to make public the material on the treaty, which was a
portion of tapes whose existence was disclosed in 1973.
   On Aug. 12, 1963, Kennedy spoke with a Senate ally, Democrat
Mike Mansfield of Montana, and shared his anxiety over the
positions of Sens. Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson of Washington, Barry
Goldwater of Arizona and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.
   ``In my opinion, the chiefs (Joint Chiefs of Staff) are the key,
and what they will say in public would be more pro-treaty than what
they will say under interrogation by Scoop Jackson with leading
questions and Barry Goldwater and Strom,'' Kennedy told Mansfield.
   The president wanted the chiefs to testfy first, in public,
before the Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by the more
sympathetic William Fulbright of Arkansas. Kennedy wanted to head
off closed testimony by the chiefs before the Armed Services
Subcommittee on Preparedness Investigation, chaired by conservative
Democrat John Stennis of Mississippi.
   ``What I am concerned about is that these chiefs will write in
private a record which they will then feel obliged to sustain in
public. Well, if we could get them on public record and publicize
that to the nation, then whatever was leaked out of the committee
would have much less impact.''
   Mansfield remained worried, warning against getting Stennis'
back up.
   ``Yeah, well, this is bigger than, than Stennis,'' Kennedy said.
   The Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was initialed in Moscow on
Aug. 5, 1963, between the Soviet Union, the United States and Great
Britain. The three nations agreed to ban nuclear explosions in the
air, underwater and on land but allowed continued testing
underground.
   Kennedy had proposed a comprehensive ban, but Soviet leader
Nikita S. Khrushchev vetoed the idea, said Sheldon Stern, a
historian at the Kennedy Library. Since 1963, the issue of a total
ban has arisen several times, but the superpowers have never agreed.
   Stern said the Oval Office tapes included no dramatic
revelations but supplied a close-up look at the treaty process.
   ``It's a mixture of so many different levels of concern:
constitutional, diplomatic, political, personal,'' Stern said.
   The tapes reveal that Kennedy was well aware of the sales job he
faced to win a two-thirds ratification vote in the Senate, and he
made sure to enlist former Presidents Truman and Eisenhower.
   In July, Kennedy spoke with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and
proposed giving a presidential speech in favor of the treaty.
   ``We got to hit the country while the country's hot. That's the
only thing that makes any impression to these goddamned senators,''
said Kennedy, who had left the Senate himself just 2{ years earlier.

<HEAD>Dukakis Ads Focus On Quayle; Bush Attacks Furlough Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis' presidential
campaign moved quickly Thursday to exploit the vice presidential
debate, releasing two television advertisements meant to cast doubt
on both George Bush's judgment and Dan Quayle's qualifications.
   The ads, on the heels of Wednesday night's debate, are aimed at
undecided voters concerned about whether the Indiana senator has
the experience and maturity needed in a vice presidential
candidate. The Dukakis campaign hopes to lure them into the
Democratic column by reinforcing those concerns.
   One spot, called ``Oval Office,'' depicts vice presidents
Truman, Johnson and Ford taking the presidential oath of office as
a narrator says one out of five vice presidents has had to rise to
``the most powerful office in the world.''
   ``For this job, after five months of reflection, George Bush
made his personal choice _ J. Danforth Quayle,'' the narrator says.
``Hopefully, we will never know how great a lapse of judgment that
really was.''
   The other anti-Quayle ad is part of a series called ``the
packaging of George Bush,'' which features a group of actors
portraying cynical Bush advisers trying to package their product
for the voters.
   In the latest rendition, called ``Crazy,'' the handlers complain
that despite their best efforts at debate coaching, Quayle blew it
anyway.
   ``We've got a disaster on our hands,'' one of the handlers says.
``Suddenly the words `President Quayle' even make me nervous,''
says another. ``Is it too late to drop him? Bring in Bob Dole?''
asks a third. ``It's too crazy,'' says a fourth. ``It's not that
crazy,'' the first one says.
   The ad ends with the same tagline as the four others in the
``packaging'' series: ``They'd like to sell you a package. Wouldn't
you rather choose a president?''
   Quayle survived the debate with no noteworthy gaffes. But the
consensus was that his vice presidential rival _ Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen _ was the clear victor.
   The two Quayle ads are part of a major Dukakis TV offensive that
includes the ``packaging'' series and four direct hits on Vice
President Bush's records on the environment, drugs, Social Security
and education.
   The Dukakis campaign also plans to introduce an ad called
``Failure,'' based on Dukakis' contention that Bush has failed
every mission given him in the Reagan administration. The
assignments have included leading fights against drugs and
terrorism; reforming federal regulations; and bettering trade
relations.
   Two of Bush's newest ads attack Dukakis, the Massachusetts
governor, for raising taxes and for letting criminals out of prison
on a ``revolving door'' furlough program. Another new spot, called
``His Mistakes,'' features Massachusetts residents complaining
about Dukakis and concludes with a Democratic woman saying she's
going to vote Republican this year.

   Nov. 28 _ After disappearing for four days, 15-year-old Tawana
Brawley is found at the apartment complex where her family had
lived. She is in a plastic bag, her body smeared with animal feces
and scrawled with racial slurs. According to her family, the girl
was kidnapped and sexually assaulted.
   Dec. 2 _ Fishkill police Officer Harry Crist Jr. commits
suicide. Although he fits the girl's description of one of her
attackers, prosecutors later say it is unlikely the death is
related to the case.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1988</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 26 _ Gov. Mario Cuomo names Attorney General Robert Abrams
special prosecutor in the case, but Brawley advisers the Rev. Al
Sharpton and attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox denounce
the appointment and refuse to cooperate.
   Feb. 10 _ Entertainer Bill Cosby and a magazine publisher offer
a $25,000 reward for information in the case.
   Feb. 29 _ A state grand jury is empaneled to investigate.

the grand jury.
   June 6 _ Mrs. Brawley again refuses to testify and is ordered
jailed for 30 days and fined $250.
   June 8 _ Mrs. Brawley takes ``religious sanctuary'' in a New
York City church.
   June 15 _ Former Sharpton aide Perry McKinnon says the Brawley
case is ``a pack of lies'' designed to advance the political agenda
of Sharpton, Mason and Maddox. Sharpton and the lawyers call
McKinnon a liar.
   June 16 _ Abrams says he is investigating the possibility of a
hoax in the case.
   June 20 _ Self-described surveillance expert Samuel McClease
says that on Sharpton's orders, he secretly tape recorded
conversations of Brawley advisers discussing misgivings about the
case. The advisers denounce McClease.
   June 21 _ Federal officials direct McClease to appear before a
federal grand jury looking into the Brawley affair.
   June 25 _ McClease turns blank tapes over to authorities and is
charged with obstruction and perjury.
   Aug. 16 _ The Brawley advisers reaffirm their stand: Miss
Brawley will not obey any subpoena. The subpoena is later rescinded.
   Sept. 21 _ Sharpton confirms reports the Brawleys have moved to
Virginia.
   Sept. 27 _ The New York Times, citing sources, reports the grand
jury has overwhelming evidence Miss Brawley lied.
   Sept. 28 _ Miss Brawley, appearing in Newark, N.J., says: ``I am
not a liar and I am not crazy. I just want justice.'' She refuses
to answer questions.
   Oct. 6 _ Grand jury report is issued, calling Miss Brawley's
story a fabrication; Abrams files charges against Mason and Maddox
with a legal review panel, announces that Sharpton is under
investigation, clears Crist and Pagones.

   This is the full text of the statement
issued Thursday by the Revolutionary Justice Organization,
threatening the safety of two American hostages, as translated from
Arabic by The Associated Press:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In the name of the almighty,
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, watching events in
Lebanon, declares that the destiny of Lebanon has become within the
priorities of our struggle in view of the new imperialist onslaught
aimed at the revolutionary strugglers and turning it into a new
Israel and a North Atlantic Treaty Organization base.
   The chain of events which preceded and followed the presidential
election poses the gravest stage of the conspiracy against Lebanon,
because it is not a circumstantial outcome of a domestic crisis,
but part of a conspiracy by Israel, Iraq and NATO carried out by
the mercenaries of the interior to partition Lebanon as a first
step to turning it into an Israeli satellite and a NATO base for
intrigues against the people of the region and to attack steadfast
Syria and other revolutionary regimes.
   The organization calls attention that those who made Lebanon
reach this stage and put its destiny at stake will not be satisfied
with what they have accomplished. They have graver and more
adventurous plans that will push the whole region to the brink and
widen the scope of the conflict, especially with the rude call for
imperialist intervention under the slogan of internationalization
by a colonial power whose black history is mothering our present
tragedies.
   From its revolutionary and combative stand, the Revolutionary
Justice Organization declares a state of utmost alert and will not
stand handcuffed. It specifies the following priorities:
   1. We call the attention of all free revolutionary strugglers to
the seriousness of what is happening and urge them to be vigilant
and close ranks against an imperialist front plotting a black
future. We urge them to forget ideological differences, because the
destiny of all is imperiled.
   2. We warn the conspirators and their tools that we shall mete
out the just punishment to the conspirators. We shall hit the heads
and nests of intrigues in Lebanon wherever they hide, be it in the
Karantina (headquarters of the main Christian militia, Lebanese
Forces), or Hazmieh (army command) or Bkirki (seat of the Maronite
patriarchate). We shall not be tolerant with the grandsons of the
crusaders. We assure them that domination of Lebanon and its
destiny shall remain illusive dreams from which they will be jolted
by our nearing showdown.
   3. We emphasize to the international conspirators that we shall
use all the cards to thwart these conspiracies, including the card
of the safety of the hostages, which we shall make the backbone of
our confrontation.
   Glory is for the oppressed and immortality for the martyrs.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization

   A woman who called to chat long-distance with her
boyfriend listened in horror as an intruder entered and shot him to
death, but police say her quick action helped them track down the
suspect.
   During a telephone call from Detroit, Sarah Gordon, 25, heard a
man enter the apartment of her boyfriend, Harold Tinch.
   Ms. Gordon asked who it was and Tinch responded ``Rick,'' and
continued their conversation as if he were not concerned, Ms.
Gordon told police.
   As the couple continued to talk, Ms. Gordon heard Tinch, 30,
tell Rick to ``put the gun down and stop playing with it.'' Tinch,
a security guard, owned a .38-caliber revolver.
   A short time later, Ms. Gordon said she heard Tinch again ask
Rick to ``put it down. Don't point it at me.''
   Suddenly, there was the sound of a gunshot, she told police.
   ``Oh, don't shoot me again,'' Ms. Gordon heard Tinch say. She
then heard two more shots.
   After a long moment of silence on the Chicago end of the line,
Ms. Gordon hung up and dialed the Chicago Police Department to
report what she heard.
   Police say her actions aided them in quickly locating the
assailant.
   When they arrived at Tinch's apartment, they found him dead,
shot in the neck, abdomen and right hand.
   Police said they questioned neighbors about any acquaintances of
Tinch named ``Rick'' and were directed to Ricardo Manuel, who lived
a short distance from Tinch's apartment.
   Manuel, 29, was charged with first-degree murder early
Wednesday, police said.
   Detectives said Manuel told them, ``I shot him, but it was
accidental. I put the gun down on the dresser and it went off.''
   Asked if they knew of any motive Manuel might have had to murder
Tinch, police said Thursday they could not say anything more about
the case.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency
says it has levied the first penalty of its kind in fining a pool
supply company more than $100,000 for failing to notify agencies of
a June chlorine fire that routed 25,000 people from homes and
businesses.
   The fines are increasing at $500 a day, Jeremy M. Firestone, the
EPA attorney handling the case, said Thursday.
   The fines totaled $101,500 by the end of the day Wednesday, he
said, and would continue until a report is filed.
   The Northeast administrator for the EPA, Michael R. Deland, said
Wednesday that the penalty was the first in the nation assessed for
violations of the EPA's community right-to-know law, enacted in
1986.
   Springfield Mayor Richard Neal vowed to press the pool supply
company until the city recovered $620,000 spent in fighting and
cleaning up the fire.
   ``I'm determined to get that money,'' Neal said. ``We'll
obviously seek damages from their insurance company, and if they
don't have insurance, we'll seek it from them.''
   Deland said All Chemical Labs Inc., which does business as
Advanced Laboratories, was fined $25,000 plus $500 a day for
failing to notify EPA officials of the June 17 accident and provide
a written report.
   He said the company was also fined $25,000 for failing to notify
the National Response Center, the nation's clearinghouse and
response center for hazardous material emergencies, when the
troubles began at the plant.
   A minor fire at the plant was controlled on the morning of June
17, but firefighters were called back to the scene that night when
a police officer spotted flames inside the building.
   The subsequent blaze, fed by thousands of exploding barrels of
chloride tablets, took four days to get under control. At its
height it sent up a cloud of poisonous chlorine gas three miles
long, 100 feet high and four blocks wide.
   More than 200 people were treated at local hospitals for minor
injuries from the fumes. Officials estimate that 180,000 gallons of
chlorine leaked.
   ``In light of the magnitude of the release and its impact on the
Springfield community, EPA considers the violations particularly
egregious,'' Deland said.
   William Hadley, attorney for the company, said it will probably
contest the fine and he questioned its severity, maintaining the
EPA ``in reality knew about this leak from the start.''
   He also said the city must prove the company was negligent
before it can collect damages. The EPA fine is based only on the
company's failure to provide a written report to date on what
chemicals spilled, how much was released and other information.
   An EPA attorney maintained the agency was summoned to the scene
by state officials, not company executives, 15 hours after the
incident began.
   The state's private cleanup contractor is also trying to recoup
the cost of the cleanup, estimated at a minimum of $500,000.
   Residents and local business firms in the evacuated areas also
have filed class-action suits against the company, which lawyers
said could reach into the millions of dollars.

<TEXT>
   Several hundred leftist
guerrillas tossed grenades at a southern civil defense post
Thursday, and a rocket grenade struck this capital's National
Assembly building, damaging a stone wall.
   Also Thursday, a leftist political coalition announced its
presidential and vice presidential candidates for next year's
election.
   One soldier was killed and three were wounded in the pre-dawn
attack on Zaragoza, 10 miles south of San Salvador, said an army
sergeant at the civil defense post.
   A rocket-propelled grenade also struck the wall of a stairway
leading to the main assembly chamber, National Police Cpl. Jose
Rodriguez said. Spectators were going up the stairs to view the
morning session when the projectile struck, but no one was hurt,
Rodriguez said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, which knocked a
couple of stones loose and left a small hole in the wall.
   Up to 400 guerrillas attacked the civil defense post in Zaragoza
at 1:10 a.m., the sergeant said. His face was bandaged and his
clothes still covered with blood from a shrapnel wound.
   ``They hit us hard, but they also have dead,'' the sergeant
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They attacked us on all
sides but we managed to fight them off.''
   He said 12 men were on duty at the time of the attack, which
lasted three hours. He did not elaborate on the guerrilla dead and
there were was no guerrilla body at the scene, as there usually is
in such cases.
   Rebels also destroyed the local office of ANTEL, the state-owned
telecommunications enterprise, and blew up two utility poles with
transformers, causing a blackout of the surrounding area, he said.
   The attack was the first on Zaragoza, a town of 6,000, in the
9-year war pitting Marxist-led rebels against forces of the
U.S.-backed government.
   Armed forces officers for two years have contended the
guerrillas had been virtually cleared out of La Libertad province,
where Zaragoza is located.
   ``Until today I had only seen the war on television,'' said
Isabel Burgos, a 40-year-old woman who lives next to the defense
post. She said spent the siege under the bed.
   The Democratic Convergence, a coalition of three small leftist
parties said Guillermo Ungo, a lawyer, would run for president and
Reni Roldan, a physician, would be its vice presidential candidate.
   Ungo is also president of the Democratic Revolutionary Front,
which is allied with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
the umbrella organization of four guerrilla groups.
   The Convergence represents the left's first participation in
elections since 1977.
   The left until now has labeled such elections a farce,
contending the civil war makes free and fair elections impossible.

<HEAD>Air Force AIDS Victim Sues Blood Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHALIMAR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An AIDS victim who claims she contracted
the disease from a transfusion at an Air Force hospital has filed
suit against the blood bank used by the hospital.
   The state Circuit Court suit for unspecified damages was filed
late Tuesday by Kandra Crosby Sicuranza, 18, against the Northwest
Florida Blood Center in Pensacola. She also filed an administrative
complaint against the Air Force.
   Ms. Sicuranza's mother, Sheila Davis, said she plans to ask $10
million from the Air Force. ``No amount of money is going to change
the facts,'' Ms. Davis said. ``My daughter is going to die. But
this will do what it can.''
   The suit alleges the blood center negligently allowed blood from
an AIDS carrier be delivered to the hospital at nearby Eglin Air
Force Base, where she gave birth to a son in January 1987. She was
a military dependent at the time.
   After the baby was delivered, Ms. Sicuranza received four units
of whole blood that hospital records indicated had been screened
and declared safe by the blood center, the suit alleges.
   Three months ago, Ms. Sicuranza learned that one of the donors
who gave the blood she received had tested positive for the AIDS
virus when he later tried to give blood. On her 18th birthday, Aug.
12, she was told she, too, had contracted the disease. Her son,
however, is free of the disease.
   Gene Roberts, director of the blood center, declined comment on
the suit, but said the facility does not pay donors and complies
with all local and federal testing standards.
   Ms. Sicuranza's lawyer, George Day, said an administrative
complaint has been filed with the Air Force as a prelude to a suit
against that service.
   ``That's what federal law says you have to do, so that's what we
did,'' Day said. ``They have six months to answer, which they never
do. What it really is, is a six-month delay that gives them time to
sort themselves out.''

<HEAD>Environmental Lobby `Scorecard' Flunks Both Vice Presidential
Candidates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite their professed support for
environmental cleanup and conservation, neither vice presidential
candidate fared particularly well on an ``environmental scorecard''
released Thursday by a lobbying group.
   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., scored 20 percent while Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, rated 40 percent, according to the League of
Conservation Voters.
   James Maddy, executive director of the league, which lobbies on
behalf of a number of environmental organizations, said Quayle's 20
percent score ``means he ges it wrong four times out of five.''
   ``I heard him say last night that he deserved a good grade for
his performance on the environment, but I guess we showed up this
morning with his transcript,'' Maddy said.
   Of Bentsen, Maddy said the Texan had rated higher in the last
Congress, when the league gave him a 50 percent rating.
   ``We'd prefer to see it go up a lot,'' Maddy said of Bentsen's
score.
   During Wednesday's debate, Quayle was asked why he had voted
``two-thirds of the time'' against environmental protection
legislation.
   ``I have a very strong record on the environment in the United
States Senate,'' he said, adding that he had voted for the
Superfund and to override a Reagan veto of the Clean Water Act.
   Bentsen derided Quayle's ``late conversion'' to environmentalism
and charged, ``it was this administration, their administration,
that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up ... Boston
Harbor.'' He said the Democrats were responsible for the Superfund
and the Clean Air and Water acts.
   Quayle, in turn, attacked Dukakis for his supposedly tardy
efforts to clean up the harbor, ``the most polluted waterway in
America,'' and his plans to ship waste outside Massachusetts for
disposal.
   The league graded House and Senate members by tallying their
votes on several issues deemed important by the league's board. The
group also took into account legislators' co-sponsorship of bills,
actions in committees and perception by environmentalists in their
home districts.
   The average score in the Senate was 47 percent, with Republicans
siding with the league 37 percent of the time and Democrats, 56
percent.
   A new Dukakis cites the league by name, noting that it ``gave
George Bush a ``D'' rating and they endorsed Michael Dukakis for
president.

<HEAD>Labor Reaffirms Nuclear Policy, Embarrassing Kinnock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Party reaffirmed its policy
of unilateral nuclear disarmament Thursday, rejecting party leader
Neil Kinnock's attempt to soften a position that has been unpopular
with British voters.
   Labor's annual conference endorsed a resolution stipulating that
a Labor government would scrap Britain's nuclear weapons and close
U.S. nuclear bases in this country during its first five-year term.
   It carried by 480,000 votes in a total of nearly 6 million, much
closer than previous ballots on an issue that has divided the party
for decades. Union leaders cast huge block votes at annual
conferences based on their memberships.
   Kinnock supported a resolution that said Britain's nuclear
weapons could be used as a bargaining chip with the Soviets and did
not set a time limit. He indicated the socialist party's leadership
might ignore the vote in drawing up the nuclear weapons platform
during a policy review to be completed next year.
   ``Today's votes ... were not conclusive,'' he told reporters
Thursday night. ``It is our duty to get a defense and nuclear
disarmament policy which can enjoy the support and confidence of
the people of this country.''
   Ken Livingstone, a leader of the Labor left, warned Kinnock:
``If you try and ditch this policy there will be civil war in this
party.''
   The defeat marked the most serious split at the conference
between Kinnock and a left wing dismayed by Labor's shift to the
center after three election losses to the Conservatives.
   Ron Todd, head of the Transport and General Workers' Union, with
1.25 million members, led opposition to what he called the
``confusion and fudge'' of the Kinnock resolution.
   It sought to keep the party's options open by calling for
disarmament by ``unilateral, bilateral and multilateral means.''
   Gerald Kaufman, party spokesman on foreign affairs, said in
debate that an unconditional disarmament policy would ``mark the
end of Britain's role in world nuclear disarmament.''
   ``The question is not whether a Labor Britain would go
non-nuclear ... but how we go non-nuclear,'' he said.
   Labor adopted the unilateral nuclear disarmament policy in 1981,
two years after losing power to Margaret Thatcher and her
Conservatives. Polls indicate it was a major factor in the party's
subsequent defeats.
   Kinnock, a lifelong campaigner against nuclear weapons, has
shifted his stance in the past 18 months and now argues that the
U.S.-Soviet agreement to destroy medium-range nuclear missiles has
created a climate for negotiation.
   The superpower agreement does not affect Britain's nuclear
weapons, submarine-carried Polaris missiles that will be replaced
in the 1990s by more potent Trident missiles Mrs. Thatcher has
bought from the United States.
   Nuclear-capable American F-111 bombers also are deployed at two
British bases and U.S. Poseidon submarines, equipped with nuclear
arms, operate from Holy Loch, Scotland.

   Six weeks ago, Julius Tomin was so hard
up he had to pedal 100 miles by bicycle to attend a world congress
of fellow philosophers.
   Starting Thursday, Tomin had a job _ as a barroom philosopher.
   Noel Reilly is paying the 49-year-old thinker $8,500 to give
three lectures a year at his Beehive pub in Swindon, 70 miles west
of London.
   Tomin thinks the 100-year-old pub is just the sort of place
where Socrates, a poor man who went barefoot, might have engaged in
his philosophical dialogues in ancient Athens.
   The first talk by the bespectacled philosopher was a discourse
on freedom to a good-natured, occasionally boisterous but generally
reverent crowd.
   Tomin, a Czechoslovak dissident emigre, steered clear of Greek
philosophers, dwelling instead on the meaning of freedom to a
prisoner.
   As customers sipped their beers, Tomin told of pounding on his
cell door for a drink of water, being refused, and pounding again
until he got it _ proof, he said, that ``wherever you are you can
do something.
   ``You can make your freedom work, even if you're under
interrogation. There's a level where you can be free, no matter
what situation you're in.''
   Customers applauded at the end of his talk.
   Tomin fled to Britain in 1980. He hasn't been able to land an
academic post, but he refused to take a job that might distract him
from his beloved pursuit of ancient Greek philosophy. That led
authorities to cut off his $114 weekly welfare check.
   Tomin's plight became public at a philosophers' congress in the
southern seaside town of Brighton in August. Tomin had spent most
of his money on registration fees and had cycled 100 miles from
Oxford, where he spends his time poring over philosophical works in
university libraries.
   His job at the Beehive pub entails giving a half-hour discourse
followed by a half-hour discussion with customers.
   A signatory to the Czechoslovak human rights manifesto Charter
77, Tomin won brief acclaim among philosophy scholars when he held
``underground'' seminars in his Prague apartment in defiance of
authorities. His controversial ideas on Plato's philosophical
development, however, have been dismissed by leading British
scholars as ingenious but weak.
   Swindon once had a poor reputation in intellectual circles. City
elders banned the medieval classic ``Decameron'' in a 1954 ruling
that was overturned amid nationwide uproar.
   One Beehive customer, interviewed on British Broadcasting Corp.
radio, joked that his knowledge of philosophy amounted basically to
``I drink, therefore I am.''
   But things have changed. The city of 91,000 has become the
capital of Britain's mail-order book market, and publican Reilly, a
red-bearded Irishman, believes Tomin will further raise the tone.
   Opening night was by free ticket only, and all 700 tickets were
snapped up. Loudspeakers were set up for crowds outside.
   ``Who would have thought you could get all those people to come
and listen to a philosopher?'' marveled Reilly.
   He said his pub was no place for drunken displays.
``Manifestations of ignorance will never be considered a virtue in
this house,'' he said.
   In recent interviews, Tomin said Plato, a student of Socrates,
also had views on pubs. Plato complained in his Laws that they
should be ``places of generosity and conviviality,'' but instead
had become ``places where the publican robbed the people.''
   Reilly thinks his ``visiting philosopher'' will have an
important influence on his patrons.
   ``Rumor has it that some of them have been seen in the local
bookshop buying books on philosophy recently so that at least
they've got some kind of a head start,'' he said.
   Did he feel ancient Greek philosophy had relevance today?
   ``Good heavens, yes. Truth always has relevance,'' Reilly
replied. ``One cannot disguise it by buying flashy motor cars, one
cannot put tinsel over it. Truth is truth.''

   Richard Land, the newly elected
executive director of the Southern Baptist Christain Life
Commission, supports capital punishment, condemns abortion and
opposes ordination of women.
   These were among requirements laid down by the now dominant
fundamentalist administration in finding a replacement for N. Larry
Baker, who left under pressure in June.
   Land, chosen as his successor, says Scripture clearly indicates
``the woman is to be in subordination to the man in the structure
of the church as an organized body and in the family as a team in
the household.''
   He says the New Testament forbids women's ``ordination to the
ministry or ruling authority.''
   Land, 41, has been vice president of academic affairs at
Criswell College, an arm of First Baptist Church in Dallas, led by
the Rev. W.A. Criswell, a leader of ``Bible inerrancy''
fundamentalists.
   Land says he opposes abortion ``except where the mother's
physical life is in extreme danger'' and ``I firmly belief in
capital punishment as part of the biblically mandated authority of
the civil magistrates.''

   Police arrested 11 demonstrators Thursday in the
third day of protests aimed at shutting down Atlanta abortion
clinics.
   The demonstration was part of a week of protests dubbed ``The
Siege of Atlanta'' by the New York-based anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue. This week, 368 demonstrators been jailed and
protest leaders have made allegations of police brutality, denied
by officials.
   Thirty arrested demonstrators have been released on bond, police
spokesman Cal Jackson said.
   On Thursday, police dragged or carried some of the people
arrested about 200 feet to a van, while sympathizers in a crowd of
about 100, on the other side of a portable steel barricade erected
by police, prayed or sang hymns.
   Seven were arrested, police said, for obstructing a car on its
way to the clinic. The others were charged with failure to obey an
officer.
   Shortly afterward, volunteers escorted a young woman up the
steps to the door of the Feminist Women's Health Center, while one
demonstrator pleaded with her to reconsider. The woman shouted that
she was going through with it, ``and I'll throw the bloody mess in
your face!''
   While some Operation Rescue members had pleaded with the woman
to reconsider, others claimed she was ``a plant'' brought to the
clinic to give the impression that it was operating normally.
   Clinic directors have said demonstrations have caused some women
to reschedule abortions, but deny that the protests have caused a
reduction in the number of appointments.
   Operation Rescue first appeared in Atlanta during the Democratic
National Convention in July, and stayed in town for much of the
summer. Since the protests began, more than 1,100 anti-abortion
protesters have been jailed, mostly on trespassing charges.
   Police have resorted to rougher, more expedient arrest tactics
this week, which has led to charges of brutality from Operation
Rescue and its leader, Randall Terry.
   Operation Rescue attorney Bob Fierer accused Atlanta police Maj.
Kenneth Burnette of kicking a protester in the face during
Tuesday's demonstration.
   ``There will be serious injuries if police don't act with
restraint,'' he said, and vowed to file a federal civil rights suit
against Burnette.
   A videotape of the incident, distributed to reporters by Fierer,
showed Burnette pushing a man with his foot or lower leg but
indicated the man did not appear to get kicked and did not appear
hurt.
   Burnette on Thursday repeated the police department's resolve
``not to let the protesters close down these legal businesses.'' If
protesters could close the clinics, they could close ``other
businesses in your neighborhood or your church if they happen to
disagree with it,'' he said.
   Terry called the clinics ``illegitimate child-killing centers
that have no right to be here. There is no negotiated settlement.''

   Cool, damp weather chilled the central Plains on Thursday, and
much of the northeastern quadrant of the country was told to watch
for frost or freezing due to dropping temperatures overnight.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms spread over Kansas, central
Oklahoma and southwest Missouri, and fog and drizzle dampened
western Nebraska and eastern Colorado. The rain kept the air cool,
holding temperatures in the 40s.
   Rainshowers also were widely scattered over the lower Great
Lakes, and there were some thunderstorms over the southern tip of
Florida and the Keys.
   Low clouds socked in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest,
with the visibility down to one-sixteenth of a mile at Everett,
Wash., due to fog.
   The National Weather Service posted overnight frost advisories
for eastern Kentucky and southern Indiana and freeze advisories for
northern Indiana and all of Michigan. Freeze and frost warnings
were issued for parts of the central and northern Appalachians and
southern New England.
   Temperatures early Thursday afternoon were in the 40s over the
northern and central Appalachians, northern New England and
northern parts of the upper Great Lakes. It was in the 50s and 60s
across much of the rest of the country, but in the 70s and 80s over
Florida, southern Georgia and along the Gulf Coast, as well as in
most of Texas, inland California and Nevada. The desert Southwest
had readings in the low to mid 90s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Loring Air Force Base near Limestone, Maine, to 95
degrees at Phoenix.
   The nation's low early Thursday was 17 degrees at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   The forecast for Friday called for called scattered showers over
Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, southwest Missouri and northeastern
Arkansas. Showers and a few thunderstorms also will develop over
southern Utah and northern Arizona, and rain is expected in western
New York. Skies will be partly cloudy over the upper Mississippi
Valley and cloudy along the mid-Atlantic coast, but mostly sunny
elsewhere.
   The highs for Friday will range from the 40s over most of Maine,
in the 50s across the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and
the Ohio Valley eastward to the northern Atlantic coast, and from
south-central Kansas to central Oklahoma. Temperatures in the 80s
were predicted for south-central and southeast Texas, Florida,
inland California, Oregon and Idaho and in the 90s in the desert
Southwest and Southern California valleys.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chilean opposition, buoyed by its
ballot-box defeat of military President Augusto Pinochet, now faces
the challenge of maintaining its new-found unity in advance of open
elections.
   In addition, potentially divisive issues such as human rights
trials and the future of the Communist Party could sow dissent as
opposition leaders pursue talks with the armed forces to speed the
transition to full democracy.
   Pinochet lost a plebiscite Wednesday on a proposal for him to
remain in power until 1997. According to the 1980 constitution
pushed through by the 72-year-old army commander's administration,
open presidential elections will be held in December 1989.
   Furher negotiations between the military government and the
opposition hinge on Pinochet's standing with his troops, said Paul
Sigmund, a Princeton University professor and expert on Chile and
Latin American authoritarian governments.
   ``I think it depends on whether the referendum loss officially
discredits him within his own service,'' Sigmund, in Santiago to
observe the voting, said during a telephone interview.
   Sigmund said the navy, air force and national police appear more
willing to negotiate than Pinochet's army, which has been fervently
loyal to its chief.
   ``They are more flexible,'' Sigmund said of the navy, air force
and national police. ``They've been predicting this'' defeat.
   Political maneuvering by top opposition figures for nomination
to the presidency also is expected to influence relations within
the 16 parties that formed a coalition to lead the anti-Pinochet
campaign.
   Sigmund said he expected Patrick Aylwin, president of the
centrist Christian Democratic Party, and Ricardo Lagos, Socialist
leader of the center-left Party for Democracy alliance, to run for
the presidency along with someone who will represent the political
right.
   Aylwin and Lagos helped lead the coalition, created early this
year after years of bitter feuding among the opposition. Pinochet
often played on those divisions to strengthen his rule.
   Aylwin and Lagos insisted after the vote that unity must be
maintained, and even expanded to include groups on the right and
left who had been excluded in the past.
   ``We don't want there to be winner and losers,'' Aylwin said.
``To the contrary, everyone must collaborate in the reconstruction
of the country.''
   ``The armed forces have an important role to play,'' Aylwin
added.
   Lagos' moderate leftist stance offends many conservatives, and
he has hinted at a willingness to put aside presidential ambitions
in the interest of a smooth transition of power.
   Asked if the pro-Moscow Communist Party should be included,
Lagos said all democratic parties to the right and the left should
be embraced. ``There should be no exclusions,'' Lagos said.
   Some leftist groups in the coalition favor including the
Communists.
   However, the armed forces are fiercely anti-communist, and the
1980 constitution outlaws communist groups and the propagation of
Marxist ideas. They are certain to reject the notion of sitting
down at the bargaining table with anyone associated with communists.
   Leftist parties also are calling for justice in human rights
abuse cases. More than 700 people disappeared and thousands have
allegedly been tortured by security forces under Pinochet,
especially in the aftermath of the 1973 coup that brought him to
power, rights groups say.
   Parties of the political right and center, apparently
recognizing the military's fear of rights trials, have approached
the issue with caution. They routinely say only that ``the truth
must be known,'' implying an investigation should be conducted but
not necessarily a trial involving military figures.
   The constitution also calls for a congress to be elected in a
year but its provisions make virtually impossible any amendments.
Observers believe the opposition's priority will be to ease the
procedure for amending the document, leaving other, more specific
changes for later.
   Leftist parties want it amended immediately to allow for quick
elections and Pinochet's rapid exit from the presidency. But Aylwin
indicated his party was in no such hurry. ``The period could be six
months, nine months, or a year,'' Aylwin said.

<HEAD>After Debate, Half in Poll Still Doubt Quayle's Qualifications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt

   Half the voters who watched the vice
presidential debate came away still doubting Republican Sen. Dan
Quayle's qualifications to serve as president, if that became
necessary, a national poll found Thursday.
   The CBS News poll of 412 debate watchers also found they
overwhelmingly believed the Democratic nominee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
won the debate. An ABC News poll released after the debate
Wednesday reached the same finding.
   Quayle was rated as qualified to be president by 47 percent in
the CBS post-debate poll, up from 37 percent who rated him
qualified before the debate. But Bentsen did better, rated as
qualified by 78 percent, up from 64 percent.
   Though Quayle's rating improved, ``I'd be worried if I was Dan
Quayle, because he still hasn't broken the 50 percent mark and this
was probably his only chance to do so,'' said Keating Holland, a
CBS poll analyst.
   CBS found that the number of debate viewers who said they would
worry about Quayle as president was little changed _ 52 percent
before the debate, 48 percent after it. Just 17 percent said after
the debate they would worry about Bentsen as president, down from
22 percent before the debate.
   CBS conducted the survey by calling back 744 likely voters it
had interviewed before the debate; the results were among the 412
of them who said they had watched all or part of it. The poll had a
five-point margin of error.
   Asked who won the debate, 50 percent in the survey chose Bentsen
and 27 percent said Quayle. The result was almost precisely the
same as the 51-27 percent split in the ABC poll.
   A CBS-New York Times poll released Tuesday put the presidential
race at 48 percent for the Republicans to 46 percent for the
Democrats. Holland said the post-debate re-survey found ``no
particular change'' in that gauge.

   The assembly line, which propelled Henry
Ford into automaking and industrial history, celebrates its 75th
anniversary this week.
   Ford Motor Co. planned a ceremony for Friday at its Wayne
assembly plant. There, Ford's great-grandson, Edsel B. Ford II,
will ride off the modern-day assembly line in a Model T.
   In remarks prepared for Friday's events, Edsel Ford, general
sales manager of the company's Lincoln-Mercury division, said that
as in his great-grandfather's time, the company still is striving
for quality and efficiency.
   ``Seventy-five years ago, my great-grandfather and his
associates put in place the mechanism to realize his dream of
building an affordable motor car for `the great multitude' using
the best employees and materials,'' Ford said.
   Production of the famous Model T began in mid-1908, and quickly,
Henry Ford was determined to bring down the price of his product.
   Three-quarters of a century ago, and a few miles away from the
sprawling Wayne assembly plant, workers at a Ford plant in Highland
Park were tinkering with an idea that would revolutionize
manufacturing worldwide.
   On April Fools' Day, 1913, an engineer in the plant's
flywheel-magneto assembly area tried out a new assembly technique
that spread quickly to other component operations.
   Then on Oct. 7, 1913, the entire process was transferred to the
final assembly area. The first Model Ts to be built by the process
were dragged by rope through the area as 150 workers stood in
place, attaching components to the frame as it passed.
   Within a few years, the technique was adopted by a wide range of
manufacturers.
   Nowadays, robots have taken the place of some workers and cars
along the assembly line are raised, lowered and tilted to make
access for workers easier. But amid the high technology, the car
moves past the worker much in the same way it did 75 years ago.

   A store's concrete awning
collapsed Thursday afternoon and crushed nine pedestrians to death
on a busy street, civil defense officials said.
   Three children and their mothers were among the dead and eight
other people were injured in the accident in Porto Alegre, a city
of 1.1 million people 1,030 miles southwest of Rio, civil defense
spokesman Orly Furtado said.
   The six-foot-wide concrete and steel structure crashed down on
shoppers passing a store of the Arapua chain, which sells household
goods.
   Firemen used cranes to lift the broken concrete from the dead
and injured, Furtado said in a telephone interview from Porto
Alegre. He said four of the injured were in serious condition.
   Furtado said the cause of the accident was not known.
   ``The building is neither new nor particularly old,'' he said.
``There are no apparent structural changes.''

   Emperor Hirohito's fever subsided Thursday after he
received his daily blood transfusion.
   Palace doctors were quoted earlier as expressing fear that
numerous transfusions in the past two weeks, already totaling more
blood than the frail, 87-year-old monarch normally has in his body,
were increasing Hirohito's fever and pulse rate.
   He received 0.4 pints ofblood Thursday morning to compensate for
continued internal bleeding, palace spokesman Kenji Maeda said, and
has received 12 pints in the past 14 days.
   His temperature settled back to 99.3 Thursday evening from 100.9
hours earlier, Maeda said.
   The world's longest-reigning monarch has been bedridden since
internal hemorrhaging caused him to cough up blood Sept. 19. He is
being fed intravenously.

<TEXT>
   Ethnic strife in a disputed region of the Caucasus
is leading to job discrimination, segregation and an exodus from
trouble spots by people of both ethnic groups, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis are engaged in ``mutual dismissals''
at enterprises in Nagorno-Karabakh's major towns, Stepanakert and
Shusha, the newspaper Selskaya Zhizn said in an article called
``Zone of Discord.''
   Many of the region's 160,000 residents have become refugees,
leaving jobs and homes to seek safety in areas where their
nationality dominates, it said.
   Correspondent O. Akulova of the daily, which appeals to a rural
audience, was clearly appalled by developments in Nagorno-Karabakh,
which is attached to Azerbaijan but has a predominantly Armenian
population.
   ``How many mixed marriages are there in Nagorno-Karabakh, how
many children from parents of different nationalities? Where will
they go in this ethnic conflict?'' the reporter asked.
   The Soviet government recently sent troops and tanks into the
area to halt strikes and violence stemming from demands by the
majority Armenians that it be transferred to Armenia.
   Violence stemming from the ethnic dispute claimed 32 lives last
February in Sumgait, Azerbaijan.
   A delegation of lawmakers from the Soviet parliament made a
fact-finding tour of the region, indicating the degree of concern
in Moscow. State radio said it ended Thursday and the group would
make recommendations to the national government.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's national leadership has said
sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh will not be changed, citing
Azerbaijan's refusal to give up an area attached to it since 1923.
   According to the newspaper report, half the Armenians in Shusha
fled after fires were set in several homes and Armenian refugees
cram the Hotel Karabakh in Stepanakert.
   ``Children play in the halls and soup gurgles on electric hot
plates, filling the air with the aroma of a communal apartment,''
it said.
   Azerbaijanis also have fled, with more than 1,000 families
leaving Nagorno-Karabakh for the nearby Azerbaijani region of
Agdam, the paper reported.
   It said a 5,500-acre collective farm was split along ethnic
lines, forcing residents to parcel out everything from fields to
shovels and rakes.

<TEXT>
   A little-used law allowed police to arrest a
woman who refused to be treated for tuberculosis and was believed
to have spread the disease to family members, officials said
Thursday.
   Margaret Allen, 29, of Suitland, was arrested Wednesday by the
Prince George's County Sheriff's Department and taken to Montebello
Rehabilitation Hospital, a state institution in Baltimore.
   She was in satisfactory condition Thursday and was expected to
remain there for three to six months, a hospital spokesman said.
   Dr. Elin Gursky, director of epidemiology and disease control
for the Prince George's County health department, said Ms. Allen
was arrested under a little-used provision of state law that allows
public health officials to control the spread of contagious
diseases.
   Tuberculosis, which is marked by coughing, night sweats and
weight loss, can be cured, but can be fatal if left untreated,
Gursky said.
   Health officials cannot force Allen to receive treatment, but
they can incarcerate her to prevent her from spreading it to
others, Gursky said. Allen was described as being in a highly
infectious stage of the disease, and could be jailed if she leaves
the hospital, Gursky said.
   Several members of her family have tested positive for
tuberculosis, and are expected to receive treatment, Gursky said.
   The criminal warrant was issued in July, after health officials
failed to find her to serve a civil injunction issued in Prince
George's Circuit Court, said Harry Matz, an assistant attorney
general with the state Department of Health and Mental Hygeine.
   Matz said repeated telephone calls and visits to Allen's home by
health officials failed to persuade her to get treatment for the
disease she was diagnosed with last winter.
   Stuart Comstock-Gay, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Maryland, said the state has the responsibility
to protect the public.
   ``On the other hand, I don't think state can force her to be
treated. But they can keep her out of the public's way if she's
going to be passing the disease frequently and easily,''
Comstock-Gay said. ``If it were the cold or flu, it would be a
different ballgame.''
   Tuberculosis is an airborne bacteria that can be transmitted by
sharing a close space with an infected person, Gursky said.

<HEAD>Report More Money Needed for Satellite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel may have to stop construction of a new
satellite unless it can find about $200 million more to finish it,
a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The satellite, designed as a communications vehicle and named
for the biblical prophet Amos, is being built by government-run
Israel Aircraft Industries and is scheduled for launch in 1993, the
newspaper Yediot Ahronot said.
   Three other papers said some army generals opposed the project
because of its high cost. Official declarations have said ``Amos''
would be used primarily for civilian purposes, beaming television,
radio and telephone transmissions to Israel.
   Yediot Ahronot said the Cabinet is expected to decide in a few
weeks whether the job can be finished.
   An Israeli official, speaking privately, confirmed the report
but would not elaborate.
   The English-language Jerusalem Post Maj.-Gen. Ehud Barak, the
deputy chief of staff, called the project as a ``Lavi fantasy.''
The Lavi was a U.S.-financed jet fighter project scrapped last year
because of cost overruns.
   Other officers objected to the new satellite because it will
cost at least $500 million, the Post said. Aircraft Industries
officials were reported to have said it would cost only half that.
   Other reports on the army controversy appeared in the socialist
newspaper Al Hamishmar on Wednesday and Davar on Thursday.
   Davar said Aircraft Industries and Defense Ministry officials
were leading the effort to obtain funds. Military and Aircraft
Industries spokesmen refused comment.
   Prof. Yuval Neeman, who heads Israel's space agency, said in a
telephone interview: ``Defense Ministry officials may have objected
to the expenditure, but it is a commercial, not a military
problem.''
   He added, however: ``Government ministries, including the
Defense Ministry, may have been asked to purchase broadcast
channels on the satellite.''
   News reports said the project was conceived by the private
General Satellite Corp. headed by former army intelligence chief
Meir Amit.
   The debate over ``Amos'' comes two weeks after Israel launched
its first space satellite, ``Horizon-1,'' which is said to carry
surveillance equipment for possible intelligence gathering.
   Neeman said ``Horizon-1'' will stay in orbit through November,
more than a month longer than originally scheduled. He said the
flight would be extended because the craft was orbiting at a
greater distance from Earth than planned.

<HEAD>Justice To Stay Out Of Suit Against Northrop Over MX Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Thursday it will
stay out of a private lawsuit against Northrop Corp. which alleges
the government was defrauded of more than $1 billion in connection
with the manufacture of the MX missile-guidance system.
   The suit brought by eight current and former Northrop employees
accuses the company's electronics division of intentionally
delivering to the Air Force defective inertial measurement units,
which guide the MX Peacekeeper missile.
   The 67-page complaint unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District Court
in Los Angeles, and filed in October 1987, says Northrop failed to
ensure that the guidance components were properly manufactured,
controlled, processed and inspected. It says Northrop wrongfully
received $1 billion from the government and seeks three times that
amount. In addition, four of those filing the suit seek
compensatory damages.
   The complaint was brought under the False Claims Act, which
allows private parties to bring suit on behalf of the government
and gives the government the right to join a case.
   Assistant Attorney General John Bolton said the Justice
Department has decided there is insufficient basis for it to enter
the matter now.
   The government could enter the suit at a later time.
   In a related matter, the Justice Department sued Northrop in
August 1987 for $3 million for failing to properly test a component
of the MX. The Justice Department suit followed a private suit
filed in 1986 by two of the eight Northrop employees involved in
the currently pending complaint.
   Tony Cantafio, Northrop's chief spokesman, said ``the quality
and reliability of the inertial measurement units Northrop builds
has been measured consistently since the MX system became
operational in December 1986, and has consistently met or bettered
Air Force expectations.''

   Republican Dan Quayle, refining his
response to what he would do if he became president, said Thursday
there was ``no question'' that he would continue George Bush's
policies.
   Asked by reporters why he had not made that response during
Wednesday night's debate, Quayle said, ``It was a very narrow
hypothetical. ... I hadn't had that question before.''
   At a fund-raiser here and rally in Joplin, Quayle said his
Democratic opponent, Lloyd Bentsen, failed repeatedly to address
``whether he would continue the extreme liberal policies of Gov.
Dukakis if he took over the presidency.''
   ``He didn't answer the question. He waffled, shuffled, ducked
and dived,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle told reporters he was disappointed the debate did not
have more questions about foreign policy, which he said was one of
his strengths.
   But it was the issue of his qualifications and the possibility
of stepping into the Oval Office that obviously concerned the
campaign Thursday, and Quayle took pains to address it in his
speeches.
   ``When I was asked that question, I made a judgment that the
people of America deserved to hear me outline the level of my
qualifications and the depth of my experience to assume the
presidency,'' Quayle said.
   ``I responded to that point and the core of my thinking is this:
there is no question that I would maintain and build on the
excellent policies of a President George Bush.''
   On his campaign plane, Quayle noted that he had answered
Wednesday night that he would first pray and then convene a Cabinet
session upon becoming president.
   ``By convening a Cabinet session, that certainly implies that
you're going to continue the policies of George Bush. I did not say
that, but that's certainly implied,'' Quayle said, adding, ``I
think I did just fine last night.''
   Quayle criticized the ``snickering and laughing'' he said came
from supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis. Quayle said he heard them when he said during the debate
that America was the ``envy of the world.''
   ``I think that's going to be one of the cutting edges of this
election because they look down on America,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle attacked Bentsen in strong terms, saying that he had been
unable to defend Dukakis' position and ``ran from Michael Dukakis
faster than a deer runs from a forest fire.''
   ``I am proud of the man at the top of my ticket. I am happy to
support his positions, and I won't run away from them like Sen.
Bentsen did last night,'' Quayle said.
   There were signs sprinkled at the Joplin rally at Missouri
Southern State College reading, ``Dan, you're no Jack Kennedy,'' a
reference to Bentsen's derisive comment when Quayle compared his
experience to Kennedy's.
   Quayle told reporters on his plane that Bentsen's comment was
``a cheap shot.''
   But asked whether he was glad the debate was over, Quayle
replied, ``I'd like to have another one.''
   The Indiana senator had a long day of campaigning Thursday, with
stops in Missouri, Florida and Tennessee. He left Omaha in an
upbeat mood, saying he was not worried about an ABC poll indicating
many viewers thought he had lost the debate. A CBS poll released
Thursday produced the same results.
   ``George Bush is going to win the election. He's still way ahead
in the polls,'' Quayle said.
   The Dukakis campaign, meanwhile, released two anti-Quayle
television ads that struck again at his qualifications. One ad
noted that Bush had chosen Quayle to replace him should tragedy
occur and said, ``Hopefully we will never know how great a lapse of
judgment that really was.''

   Tempers flared as a House chairman accused the
head of the Foreign Agricultural Service on Thursday of concealing
abuses in a government program designed to spur American tobacco
exports.
   ``This is a cover-up,'' Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., told Thomas
O. Kay, administrator of the Agriculture Department's Foreign
Agricultural Service, at a hearing on abuses in a credit guarantee
program for farm exports.
   ``I resent that,'' Kay retorted.
   ``I don't care if you resent it or not,'' replied Rose, chairman
of the House tobacco and peanuts subcommittee. ``You were covering
up a fraudulent practice in the Foreign Agricultural Service.''
   The Justice Department is investigating the program, under which
USDA guarantees private companies they will be paid for American
farm goods they export even if foreign buyers default.
   Tobacco shipments worth a total of $30.3 million were guaranteed
under the program for 1988, according to Agriculture Department
officials.
   The controversy concerns a USDA inspector general finding that
14 companies falsely told the department that all of the tobacco
for which they obtained credit guarantees was American grown.
   Actually, some had been imported, blended with American tobacco
and re-exported under the program, the report said.
   Initial reports of a problem emerged from Iraq in 1986, bringing
congressional demands for an investigation. Tobacco-state lawmakers
said the program was designed to aid U.S. farmers, not foreigners.
   At the time, the Foreign Agricultural Service dismissed the
concern. Follow-up by the inspector general, however, resulted in
the allegations under investigation and which are agitating Capitol
Hill.
   ``It makes my blood boil,'' declared Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C.,
who said he was ``hoping that the people who have broken the law
end up in the penitentiary.''
   Kay told lawmakers he was as ``infuriated'' as they were by the
disclosures and said claims by exporters that their tobacco was 100
percent American may have constituted fraud.
   He said, however, that he had been surprised by the allegations
and that he had seen no reason to question the assurances of
exporters.
   It had always been the policy of the Foreign Agricultural
Service to provide credit guarantees for the U.S.-produced portion
of exports that blended American products and those coming from
overseas, he said.
   Rose said that sounded exactly the opposite of what Kay had told
lawmakers at a June hearing and he instructed the administrator to
produce any documents showing that such has been the policy.
   After finding that the department's counsel was not present, Kay
promised to provide the panel with whatever paperwork existed.
   Rose then called on witnesses from the inspector general's
office and the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of
Congress, who had testified earlier and were still among the
spectators.
   They said they had turned up no documents showing that the
Foreign Agricultural Service had ever maintained a policy of
providing the guarantees for the American portion of blended
exports.
   GAO officials said their investigation indicated guarantees were
provided only for exports that were 100 percent American. They said
they were told that the only exception was for a type of baby food
that contained a small amount of oil not produced in the United
States.
   Kay told the panel that the baby food example indicated that
``the possibility existed'' that blended exports could receive
credit guarantees.
   That phase of the dispute is pertinent because the service
issued a new policy last month under which it will guarantee credit
for the U.S.-produced portion of a shipment that is at least 75
percent American. Kay said that was actually stricter than the old
policy.
   Allan I. Mendelowitz, GAO senior associate director, told the
subcommittee that the Foreign Agricultural Service ``took a
hands-off management approach because it viewed the programs as
commercial programs that are the responsibility of the private
sector.''
   Kay said that was not the view of the agency and demanded to
know the name of service employee who had given that information to
GAO staffers.
   ``I will guarantee you that he will be reprimanded,'' Kay said.
   Rose told the administrator to forget about getting the names.
   ``I don't think you need to berate them for doing their jobs as
we paid them to do,'' Rose said.

   George Bush tried to rally voters
around his embattled running mate Thursday, saying Dan Quayle has
been ``unfairly pounded'' by his opponents but proved himself in
his debate with Democrat Lloyd Bentsen.
   After barely mentioning Quayle during two earlier stops in
Texas, Bush brought up the debate during an evening rally before
several thousand people _ even after his campaign strategists had
spent the day playing down the debate's importance.
   Polls show that Quayle has been a drag on the GOP presidential
ticket, with many voters concerned about his qualifications.
   Democratic rival Michael Dukakis frequently belittles Quayle's
qualifications, and Democratic vice presidential candidate Bentsen
stunned Quayle in Wednesday night's debate by telling the
boyish-looking senator, ``you're no Jack Kennedy'' _ a political
hero with whom the GOP candidate had just compared himself.
   Taking up Quayle's case, Bush said: ``He did an outstanding job
(in the debate) and he has been unfairly pounded by my opponents.
And last night, last night, the country saw what I have seen all
along _ a young knowledgeable experienced American and I am proud
to have put my trust in a whole generation of young people.''
   The crowd roared approval.
   Bush spent most of the day campaigining in Texas, first in Fort
Worth and later in Midland. It was a day when the theme was
supposed to focus on Bush's call for a ``common sense'' attack
against crime with emphasis on busting street gangs.
   Bush spoke before the Fort Worth Crime Commission, an
organization of law enforcement officials and citizens involved in
anti-crime efforts. Afterward, he flew to Midland to make an energy
address in the community where he broke into the oil business in
the 1950s.
   In Midland, Bush made only a brief reference to the debate,
telling an airport rally, ``I think Dan Quayle did an outstanding
job.'' he did not mention Quayle in his speech earlier in Fort
Worth.
   While Bush and his strategists struck an upbeat note about the
debate, polls by ABC and CBS indicated that Bentsen was the clear
winner.
   Arguing that the debate will have very little impact on the
outcome of the presidential race, Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater
said ``an event like that has very little to do with the election.''
   ``This race is going to quickly get back to the two candidates
for president,'' Atwater said.
   Bush, while warming up for a morning jog at Texas Christian
University, brushed aside a question about Bentsen's tart response
when Quayle said he was as experienced as Kennedy when he sought
the presidency.
   ``I'm not going to tell you what I think about that because I'm
out here to have some fun,'' he said.
   But Bush supporters at the Midland rally made the most of the
exchange. Campaign signs distributed to children to hold said:
``Dan's no JFK. Thank God.''
   Bush has recently become more specific on issues, perhaps stung
by Democrats' barbs that he has been running a campaign of slogans
and no substance.
   In Fort Worth, he assailed the prison furlough program in
Massachusetts under Democratic rival Michael Dukakis, saying:
``1,905 times he gave free, unsupervised weekend passes to
first-degree murderers, many sentenced to life without parole.
Fifty-nine criminals convicted of violent crimes never came back
from the governor's generous vacation program.''
   Trying for an evening news sound-bite, Bush tried a twist on
tough-guy actor Clint Eastwood's warning to criminals: ``Go ahead,
make my day.'' Reagan has also made frequent use of that line.
   ``My opponent's answer is slightly different,'' Bush said. ``His
motto is: `Go ahead, have a nice weekend.''
   Bush's ``common sense'' anti crime program contained a variety
of proposals, old and new, including use of the death penalty,
doubling the federal prison budget to build new facilities with an
additional $250 million each year, and converting unneeded military
bases into state and federal prisons.
   Money seized from drug dealers and racketeers should be
earmakred to help pay for more prison space, he said. He proposed
creation of an anti-gang unit within the Justice Department's
criminal division to coordinate resources of federal, state and
local agencies.
   He called for new mandatory sentences for gang activity
involving interstate drug and weapons trafficking and racketeering.
A fact sheet distributed with his speech said Bush would urge
states to permit the prosecution as an adult anyone 15 years old
and up who is charged with murder, rape, armed robbery, armed
burglary, felony assault or drug trafficking.
   As part of the war against gangs, Bush said,``We should make
sure that no one makes bail, is given probation, gets out on parole
or stays out on parole unless they can pass a drug test.''
   In Midland, Bush said Dukakis had experienced ``a battlefield
conversion'' on energy policy in his pursuit of Texas voters. He
said Dukakis had changed his mind after once advocating a windfall
profits tax on oil companies.
   Bush said that Dukakis, in 1976, had said the nation must press
for re-regulation of natural gas. ``These days he talks mushily of
`the question of deregulating natural gas,' of a `delicate
balancing of interests,' of protecting `both consumers and
producers,''' Bush said.

   The day after an Energy Department draft
report sharply criticized Savannah River Plant management, the
nuclear facility suffered an equipment failure that led to a
release of radioactive tritium gas.
   The escape of less than .01 millirems of the gas into the
atmosphere Thursday morning posed no threat to health, said plant
spokeswoman Becky Craft. Workers at the plant, the nation's only
producer of weapons-grade plutonium and tritium, were not
evacuated, and the mayor said, ``The town's not upset at all.''
   ``The tritium ... was released into the atmosphere from the
facility's stack,'' a statement issued by the plant's management
said. ``The accidental release occurred as the result of equipment
failure during routine operations inside the Tritium Facility.''
   A millirem is a measure of radiation; a routine chest X-ray
totals about 20 millirems, according to Ms. Craft.
   The draft report criticized the Energy Department and its prime
contractor at the plant, Du Pont, for poor staff training, poor
communications and sloppy operating procedures that have undermined
safety.
   The 50-page report made a host of recommendations, including
stepping up oversight so problems can be caught before they become
serious.
   In Washington, four senators Thursday asked an independent
committee to review safety and operations at the plant in the wake
of disclosures that as many as 30 major mishaps over 30 years had
not been reported to Energy Department headquarters or made public.
   Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.; James McClure, R-Idaho; Bennett
Johnston, D-La., and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., called for an
investigation by the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facilities
Safety, which was established by Energy Secretary John Herrington
to give independent assessments of operations at nuclear facilities.
   The New York Times on Thursday reported that a study by a
consulting firm of the plant's operations from 1971-1987 showed
that chronic equipment failure and poor operating procedures caused
nuclear reactors to shut down unexpectedly nine to 12 times a year
for nearly two decades.
   That rate is twice that of the civilian nuclear power industry,
and Richard W. Starostecki, the Energy Department's chief safety
operator, told the newspaper that civilian reactors with the same
number of forced shutdowns would have had their operating licenses
revoked.
   At the Statehouse in Columbia, a dozen people held a two-hour
vigil Thursday morning.
   ``These types of mishaps are serious. It's scary to hear that
they've had fuel melts,'' said Michael Lowe of the environmental
action group Greenpeace. ``It's just poor, poor management. They're
managing not only our lives, but our tax dollars.''
   In contrast, the longtime mayor of Aiken said, ``I'm not at all
concerned about the townspeople's safety'' because of the plant.
``It's been there for 30 years and nobody's died yet,'' said Mayor
H. Odell Weeks, 80.
   ``The community doesn't seem to be upset about it at all, at
least to my knowledge,'' agreed City Manager Roland Windham.
   ``The people at SRP, they're our neighbors. We go to school with
them. We go to church with them,'' said Windham. ``I have faith
they wouldn't have done something that would endanger their own
families.
   ``Even after reading about the things that have happened, I
still have trust in DOE, that they're going to look after the best
interests of everyone concerned,'' said Windham, who has been city
manager for 25 years.
   Jeff Scott, who owns a beauty and barber shop on the town's
tidy, two-block shopping plaza, said: ``Everybody's nonchalant who
comes in the shop. They're more concerned about jobs than danger.
   ``But I'm concerned. I want to know if there's any danger to the
environment, what kind of danger there'd be to our health,'' he
said.
   The Energy Department draft report was written by a nine-member
committee of senior Energy Department officials and representatives
of companies that operate the department's nuclear weapons
facilities, including Du Pont.
   A spokesman for Du Pont said company officials had not yet seen
the report, but already moved to correct some of the deficiencies
it cited.
   ``Some of these problems have been identified,'' spokesman Clif
Webb said. ``We have been thinking about making these changes for
some time.''
   While acknowledging there have been some changes, the Hamric
Report, report, named for committee Chairman Phil Hamric, said that
serious problems exist at virtually every level of Savannah River's
management and reactor staff.
   The authors concluded that reactor operators are not adequately
trained to detect evolving problems and that operators'
``perception of their safety role is too limited. ... Reactor
personnel lack the in-depth technical background and training
necessary to manage (abnormal) situations.''
   They recommended that communications be streamlined at all
levels, training of reactor operators be improved and oversight be
strengthened.
   The panel was created in response to a request from Paul W.
Kaspar, Energy Department manager at Savannah River, after an
aborted attempt to restart the P-Reactor this August. That reactor
and the facility's other two reactors remain shut down.

   Algeria proclaimed a state of emergency
and imposed a curfew Thursday to quell rioters devastating the
capital for a third straight day in a revolt against high prices
and unemployment.
   The military command, in a late-night statement, said rioters
damaging public property would be fired on.
   President Chadli Bendjedid, in the first serious crisis of his
10-year rule, put all administrative and security authorities under
military command Thursday morning. It was the first time soldiers
were in charge of public order since French rule ended 26 years ago.
   Submachine gun fire could be heard repeatedly in the center of
Algiers Thursday afternoon and evening.
   The French news agency, Agence France-Presse, reported at least
two people dead.
   The military command issued a midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew Thursday
night for Algiers and its suburbs as sporadic demonstrations and
street fires continued. The command said those ignoring the curfew
risked arrest.
   The command said public property would be protected ``by force,
including the use of arms, after warning shots.''
   Unconfirmed reports said injured people were hospitalized but
hospital personnel would not answer questions. Many arrests were
reported but authorities gave no figures. Damage has been estimated
informally at several hundred million dollars but no official
figures are available.
   Large sections of Algiers were scenes of devastation with
government buildings burned, cars and buses overturned and windows
broken. Smoke from tear gas hung in the air.
   Inflation has totaled more than 20 percent a year on some items,
particularly food other than bread, which is subsidized. Unofficial
estimates put unemployment in the cities above 40 percent and there
is no unemployment compensation.
   A government economic reform program has caused dramatic
increases in the prices of some staples. A pound of beef sells for
about $11.40 or more, and in some places drinking water is sold for
about $4 a gallon.
   Other parts of the country appeared calm Thursday.
   State-run television interrupted regular programs with this
appeal:
   ``All the inhabitants of Algiers and its surroundings are asked
to return to their homes immediately and to remain calm to allow
the normal course of life to be restored. Every citizen must
contribute to this.''
   It appealed to families to help calm the situation and asked the
entire population to help the military restore order.
   The Algiers military command established under the emergency
issued a ``Communique No. 1'' declaring the army would ensure
respect for law. It banned demonstrations or gatherings and said
looters would be arrested and tried.
   ``Young people manipulated by the enemies of the Algerian people
and its revolution have sacked public buildings, looted public and
private property, violated private homes and harmed the very
symbols of the national patrimony,'' the communique said.
   Public buildings were set afire by young rioters in several
districts of Algiers.
   Several government buildings, including the Ministry of
Education and a state-owned supermarket in the Ruisseau district,
were consumed by flames. Heavy black smoke hung over the city.
   Papers from official files littered the street outside the
Education Ministry.
   Soldiers and tanks surrounded the Bachjarrah housing complex in
eastern Algiers, where several hundred demonstrators built burning
barricades of cars, furniture and tires.
   As on previous days, the revolt did not have a single objective.
It began last week with strikes at industrial plants, postal and
communications facilities and the national airline Air Algerie.
   School children and university students went into the streets
Tuesday and riots began when organized gangs of Islamic
fundamentalists armed with iron bars joined the crowds, trying to
turn the protests in their favor.

   A federal judge on Thursday denied a Justice
Department request to force the District of Columbia to accept more
convicts into its crowded prisons, and ordered the federal
government to temporarily house newly sentenced D.C. inmates.
   The city closed its overcrowded penal system to new prisoners
Tuesday when a court order limiting the city jail's population took
effect. The Justice Department on Wednesday asked for a temporary
restraining order to delay imposition of the inmate cap, but U.S.
District Judge Thomas Hogan refused the request.
   Hogan's ruling requires the government to provide temporary
housing for the approximately 20 inmates who enter the city's penal
system daily. He scheduled a hearing for Oct. 17 on the larger
question of whether the D.C. Code makes the federal governmen
responsible for the district's prisoners.
   Prisoners sentenced since Tuesday's shutdown have been housed in
places ranging from a cellblock basement to traffic division
holding cells. Police department station houses were told to be
ready to accept prisoners Thursday.
   The judge expressed concern about the welfare of the inmates,
saying the city ``has apparently made these prisoners hostage to
its crisis situation.''
   ``We will not continue this for the duration, '' said
 also writes a nationally
syndicated political column called ``Inside Report,'' and two
newsletters.
   Shields is The Washington Post syndicated columnist, political
analyst for Public Broadcasting Service's ``McNeil-Lehrer News
Hour'' and does commentaries on ABC radio.
   Hunt joined The Wall Street Journal in 1965 and has been
Washington bureau chief since October 1983.

   A federal judge agreed Thursday to allow the
chief plaintiff and three others to drop out of a lawsuit seeking
$1.5 million in damages against the Ku Klux Klan.
   U.S. District Judge Charles A. Moye Jr. also ordered that the
verdict returned Wednesday remain sealed while he canvassed the
other 53 plaintiffs. They have until Oct. 25 to reach their
decision.
   The unusual turn of events began Wednesday while the jury was
still out, triggered by an announcement by Councilman Hosea
Williams that he wished to drop the complaint.
   The suit charged the defendants conspired to disrupt a
``brotherhood march'' and violate the marchers' civil rights in
Forsyth County on Jan. 17, 1987.
   In a rambling explanation to the court, Williams, a longtime
civil rights activist, said he had been losing sleep worrying about
the blue-collar defendants ``who have nothing but their homes,
their cars and their paychecks. ... I could not disrupt their
families.''
   State Rep. Billy McKinney of Atlanta, who joined the lawsuit in
July, objected to Williams' decision to withdraw, and that resulted
in a hectic day of legal maneuvering while jurors continued
deliberating.
   The suit seeks $500,000 each in damages against the Invisible
Empire Knights of the KKK and the Southern White Knights of the
KKK; $200,000 against Southern White Knights Grand Dragon David W.
Holland; and $100,000 each against Invisible Empire leaders Daniel
B. Carver and Edward Stephens, and Marion Franklin Shirley, an
associate of Holland.
   Participants in the 1987 march were pelted with rocks, bottles
and other debris thrown by people among a large group of
counterdemonstrators who gathered in the virtually all-white county
north of Atlanta.
   A week later, more than 20,000 people descended upon Forsyth
County in a huge civil rights march that drew worldwide attention.
   During the hearing Thursday, Moye rejected a bid by Williams to
have McKinney dismissed from the suit, but agreed to allow Williams
and plaintiffs Elizabeth W. Omilama, Terrie L. Randolph and Forrest
Sawyer Jr. to drop out.
   The judge and both sides agreed that if punitive damages were
awarded, the amount would be reduced to reflect the number of
plaintiffs remaining in the suit.

   Republican George Bush racked up two more
endorsements in rival Michael Dukakis' home state of Massachusetts
on Thursday, gaining the support of a Worcester police union and
The Sun newspaper in Lowell.
   The 87-member Worcester Police Officials Association voted 21-1
on Wednesday to endorse Bush for president. The association
represents deputy chiefs, captains, lieutenants and sergeants.
   Sgt. Roger L. Steele said the union fears Dukakis would
liberalize the U.S. Supreme Court while in office. Police unions in
Boston, Lawrence and Springfield have also endorsed Bush.
   The 303-member Worcester Chapter of the International
Brotherhood of Police Officers ealier this month declined to make a
presidential endorsement.
   The Sun, which twice endorsed Ronald Reagan and supported Gerald
Ford in 1976, credited Dukakis for his help as governor in
rejuvenating Lowell but concluded that was not enough to support
him for president.

   A millionaire businessman and foundation
president has been charged with sodomizing five Harlem boys after
pretending to take an interest in their welfare, prosecutors said.
   William Barnes Hunt, 51, used his money to ingratiate himself
with the boys' families, District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said
Thursday. Hunt bought food, paid some of their families' bills and
took the boys _ aged 6 to 9 _ to parks and zoos.
   Hunt was arrested Aug. 10 and charged with fondling a 6-year-old
boy he had lured into his car on a Harlem street, Morgenthau said.
He said a neighbor had called police after she saw Hunt invite the
boy into his auto.
   Police searched the car and found a small black Scottie dog,
toys, an instant camera and film. The indictment accused Hunt of
using children in sexual performances after police searched his
car, home and office and found four sexually explicit photographs
of naked young boys.
   The 33-count indictment voted Wednesday charged Hunt with 11
counts of sodomy, 13 counts of sexual abuse and nine counts of
endangering the welfare of a child. The top count, sodomy, is
punishable by up to 25 years in prison.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Galligan set Hunt's bail at
$25,000 and scheduled a hearing for Oct. 19.
   The boys Hunt is charged with sodomizing are being tested for
sexually transmitted diseases, Morgenthau said.
   Morgenthau said none of the parents of the boys knew what Hunt
was up to. He said they thought the defendant was a generous man
offering their children a glimpse of life they would not ordinarily
see.
   Hunt's family put him in an undisclosed Manhattan psychiatric
hospital after his arrest because he said he was going to kill
himself, Morgenthau said.
   The district attorney said Hunt might have been involved with
many more children.
   ``We realized very early on that there was probably more to this
case than a single isolated instance of pedophile activity,'' he
said. He asked that anyone with information about such activity
call his office.
   Hunt, an investment banker, is president of Own Canoe Corp., a
firm that offered counseling to children and teens, and president
of the William Barnes Hunt Foundation, Morgenthau said.
   The defendant graduated from St. Paul's preparatory school in
New Hampshire and from Columbia University. He is a member of the
exclusive Union Club in Manhattan.

<HEAD>Lawyer for Instructors Says Many Cadets Were Unfit</HEAD>

   Recruits who collapsed in the first
week of physical training at the state police academy were unfit
for the demanding work, said a lawyer representing the state
troopers who led the class.
   ``At least half of those tested did not meet state police
requirements,'' said Timothy M. Burke, counsel for the State Police
Association of Massachusetts.
   At least 16 recruits from the class of 50 were hospitalized with
dehydration and exhaustion by the end of the first week of
instruction. One is just coming out of a coma.
   Burke said he represents the two troopers who ran the academy's
physical training program because they are union members. He said
no formal complaints have been filed against them, but ``I
represent members in any type of situation, including allegations
of misconduct.''
   State probes of the academy's training by the governor's office,
the state attorney general and the speaker of the house have begun
in the wake of the reports of illness by cadets.
   Burke said he studied physical fitness test scores of Agawam
academy recruits who entered the 14-week class beginning Sept. 19.
   The cadets were from municipal police forces throughout western
Massachusetts, required by state law to attend the academy for
training.
   Burke acknowledged that state police requirements are more
stringent than those for municipal forces. He declined to specify
the state police physical requirements. ``I can't give you that in
25 words or less,'' he said.
   He said the cadets' test results were released to him by the
state Department of Public Safety and the Criminal Justice Training
Council, which runs the academy, in response to a freedom of
information request.
   A spokeswoman at the state Department of Public Safety said
municipal police cadets undergo the same pre-entrance tests as
state police cadets, but the tests are entrance requirements only
for state police cadets.
   Municipal cadets must pass only a doctor's examination and a
body fat test to be admitted to the police academy.
   Spokeswoman Barbara Kopans said the Criminal Justice Training
Council had been considering changing its fitness requirements when
several members of the Agawam class fell ill.
   Timothy Shepard, 25, of Pittsfield, who collapsed the first day
of class at the academy, emerged from his coma Thursday and
listened to the American League baseball championship series on the
radio, his family said Thursday.

   An operating room flash fire fatally burned a
15-day-old premature baby undergoing emergency heart surgery
Thursday, a hospital spokesman said.
   The 2-pound infant suffered second-degree burns over 60 percent
of his body in the 8 a.m. fire. He died two hours later, said Ron
Wise of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   ``The baby was already in congestive heart failure and the burns
combined to cause death,'' Wise said.
   Wise said the cause of the flash fire wasn't known. ``Our
technicians are looking at everything. The equipment was all
working properly. It is very curious. We just don't know,'' said
Wise.
   None of the operating room surgeons or personnel was injured.
   Oxygen was being used during the procedure, Wise said, but
added, ``There was nothing unique about this. No one has ever heard
of this occurring.''
   The infant, born 16 weeks premature, was suffering heart failure
when the emergency procedure in the hospital's neonatal unit was
started by a team of three surgeons, a neonatalologist, a nurse and
an anesthesiologist.
   ``There were flames and the baby was lifted immediately up and
taken to the intensive care unit. The baby was immediately put on
life support, but died two hours later,'' said Wise.
   It wasn't known if the parents were in the hospital at the time,
said Wise, who didn't release the identity of the family or the
name of the infant.
   ``The staff and nurses up there are devastated by this,'' Wise
said.
   The surgery was meant to correct a congenital heart defect known
as patent ductus arteriosus. The defect occurs when a small duct
between the aorta, the artery leaving the left side of the heart,
and the pulmonary artery, which leaves the right side of the heart,
fails to close as it should soon after birth. As a result, blood
from both sides is pumped into the pulmonary artery and from there
into the lungs.
   ``Normally, medication is used, but 20 percent don't respond,''
Wise said. ``They went in surgically to try to correct it. We've
done this about 50 times earlier and there were no problems.
Nothing like this ever happened.''
   Firefighters responded to an automatic alarmed triggered by
activation of the sprinkler system, but the fire was out by the
time they arrived, said Jim Wells, spokesman for the Fire
Department.
   Cedars-Sinai, located in West Los Angeles near Beverly Hills and
other exclusive communities, is sometimes known as the ``hospital
to the stars'' because of the many celebrities who are treated
there.

   Tawana Brawley's tale of rape by a
gang of whites was a lie turned into a powder keg of racial tension
through the ``hucksterism and opportunism'' of her advisers, New
York's attorney general said Thursday.
   ``We have the facts. We have solved the case. The allegations
she had made are false,'' Robert Abrams said as he released copies
of an exhaustive, 170-page grand jury investigation of the black
teen-ager's story.
   The grand jury said it found no evidence of sexual assault and
said Miss Brawley herself was responsible for the degraded
condition in which she was found after a four-day disappearance
last November.
   The investigation received no cooperation from Miss Brawley or
her family, who with their advisers _ the Rev. Al Sharpton and
attorneys C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox _ had accused
authorities of a racially motivated cover-up.
   ``They have charged the atmosphere with incredible, incendiary
remarks and with extraordinary tension,'' Abrams said during a news
conference. He asked the state judicial discipline committee to
punish the lawyers.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who appointed Abrams special prosecutor, was
asked later about Sharpton, Mason and Maddox. He replied: ``Is
there anyone left in America who believes them?''
   Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28, seemingly dazed, outside an
apartment that had recently been vacated by her family in
Wappingers Falls, 75 miles north of New York City. Her body was
smeared with feces and scrawled with racial slurs.
   She claimed she had been held captive for four days and raped by
several white men, and she implicated law enforcement officials in
the attack.
   The grand jury provided no reason for Miss Brawley to lie but
noted that she had been punished and beaten on previous occasions
by her mother and her mother's boyfriend, Ralph King, for leaving
home and staying out late.
   The report cleared Assistant District Attorney Stephen Pagones
and Harry Crist Jr., a policeman who committed suicide shortly
after Miss Brawley was found. Both were accused by her advisers of
taking part in the alleged attack.
   Abrams charged the Brawley lawyers lied repeatedly about the
case, urged their clients to break the law and ``made every effort
to prevent the criminal justice system from uncovering the truth of
what happened to Tawana Brawley.''
   The attorney general accused the advisers of ``opportunism and
hucksterism in presenting their personal agenda'' and added:
``Perhaps the greatest disservice done by the Brawley advisers is
the reckless manner in which they jeopardized the rights of future
victims of racial assaults.''
   Miss Brawley's advisers bitterly attacked the report.
   ``What should we expect from 21 whites from Dutchess County?''
Mason asked on New York City radio station WLIB, referring to 21
whites on the panel of 23. ``It is clear they never intended to
arrest and prosecute those people who did this to Tawana Brawley.''
   Sharpton said Abrams is ``not after people who rape black girls.
... They want to stop anybody who will stand up for the rights of
black people in this country.''
   ``It ain't over till she (Miss Brawley) sings,'' he said. ``You
don't know her story.''
   No charges were filed against Miss Brawley.
   ``First of all, it's got to be recognized and reasserted that
we're dealing with a young girl,'' said Abrams. ``But I think she
also must realize the kind of turmoil she set in place as a result
of her false allegations.
   ``I think she needs help and should get as much help as possible
so her life can be salvaged.''
   Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda, faces a 30-day jail term for
contempt after refusing to answer a grand jury subpoena at the
advisers' urging, but has so far escaped arrest, at one point
seeking sanctuary in a church.
   Her daughter also defied a subpoena but was not cited for
contempt. Miss Brawley left her new home in Virginia Beach, Va.,
Thursday without comment.
   Thursday night, Sharpton led about 200 people in a demonstration
outside the offices of The New York Times, which reported details
of the grand jury's report last week. Sharpton said events showed
the newspaper had illegal access to the grand jury's findings.
   Sharpton said he and Miss Brawley would be in Chicago on
Saturday to ``give our complete and official reaction.''
   The grand jury heard more than 180 witnesses. The probe cost
taxpayers at least $620,000, and the case was investigated
``perhaps in a more thorough way than any other case in the history
of the state,'' Abrams said.
   The report examined Miss Brawley's behavior down to a
microscopic level, including analyses of dog hairs found in feces,
burn marks on Miss Brawley's jeans, and carpet fibers found in her
former apartment.
   The report concluded Miss Brawley spent much of her time during
the four days at the apartment.
   The report said Miss Brawley apparently burned a hole in her
pants, scrawled ``nigger'' on her shoe, smeared dog feces on her
body and clothing, and stepped into a plastic garbage bag in front
of the apartment.
   The grand jury issued recommendations to the Legislature for
legal reforms, including a proposal that would allow the relative
of a dead person to bring a defamation case when the individual is
falsely accused of a felony.
   Abrams and the grand jury also recommended enactment of an
obstruction of justice law.
   New York has a law against obstruction of governmental
administration, but it cannot be used against Maddox and Mason
because it applies only when a threat of violence or a separate
criminal act is employed, the attorney general said.
   He also called for changes in a state law that prevented him
from moving against those who helped protect Mrs. Brawley from
arrest for contempt.
   Under state law, people can be charged with harboring a fugitive
only if the offense for which the fugitive is wanted is a felony,
Abrams said. The contempt charge was not a felony.

<HEAD>World Watches, Applauds Chile After Pinochet Defeat</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Chile, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet television on Thursday celebrated the defeat of Chile's
right-wing President Augusto Pinochet, saying voters' rejection of
his bid to rule until 1997 proved ``power can be seized by
bayonets, but they cannot keep it.''
   Since 1973, Pinochet ``played the role of the firm but just
`father of the nation,' trying to make Chileans forget the bloody
history of his ascension to the throne, his betrayal of the
Constitution, the murder of Salvador Allende,'' Soviet political
observer I. Fesynenko said on the TV.
   But Fesynenko noted that: ``First of all, Pinochet will be in
power until March 1990, and only in December 1989 will presidential
elections be held in the country, if the dictatorship does not
abolish them first.''
   In Washington, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the people
of Chile ``have spoke eloquently, convincingly and courageously.
After 15 years of military rule, Chile has said `No' to
dictatorship and `Yes' to democracy.
   ``We congratulate the people of Chile for having given the world
such an impressive demonstration of the power of the ballot box,''
said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   The West German government called on Chile's military leaders to
abide by terms for the nation's democratization.
   ``We hope that the government will now hold to its own promised
timetable and continue on a course to allow open and free
elections,'' government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling said.
   George Foulkes, a foreign affairs spokesman for the British
opposition Labor Party and one of 500 foreigners who visited Chile
to view the balloting, said, ``It's a tremendous triumph for
democracy in Chile, a totally unique situation where a dictator has
been voted out in a plebiscite.''
   Foulkes added, ``It is absolutely crucial now to ensure that
Pinochet fully accepts the decision of the Chilean people.''
   Some Latin leaders reacted with restrained pleasure.
   InArgentina, President Raul Alfonsin said, ``The people of Chile
have expressed their inalienable right to decide their own future.
The results of plebiscite open the way toward the restoration of
democracy.''
   Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreu Sodre of Brazil said,
``Defeating a dictatorship is not easy, but when a government stays
a long time in office it becomes a heavy burden to the people.''
   Mexican Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda Amor, in New York
for the U.N. General Assembly, said: ``We congratulate the Chilean
people for this proof of civic maturity, for this capacity to
transform their own political lives in an orderly manner.''
   The Mexican government, which broke relations with Chile after
the 1973 coup, gave asylum to many Chileans, including Hortensia
Bussi, President Allende's widow. Bussi recently returned to
Santiago after the military government allowed exiles to return.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France said he learned ``with a
profound joy of the results of the referendum in Chile and of the
perspectives opening up for the re-establishment of democracy,
suffocated 15 years ago in this country.''
   In Rome, legislators rose to their feet in Parliament to applaud
the news of Pinochet's defeat. The government immediately named a
new ambassador to Santiago, a post long vacant in a sign of protest.
   Britain's Foreign Office said, ``We hope that the plebiscite
result, which appears to reflect the will of the Chilean people,
will represent an important first step on the path back toward full
democracy.''
   Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said ``the
people of Chile have given a great lesson of political maturity.''
   Added Laurent Fabius, speaker of the French National Assembly,
``It's a country that suffered terribly for 15 years ... and now,
all of a sudden, there is light and hope again.''

   The owner of a Las Vegas resort who conducted
two parties marking the birth date of Adolf Hitler apologized for
his actions Thursday, saying the events were ``not only stupid, but
insensitive.''
   Ralph Engelstad told a news conference that the parties and
reports of a room full of Nazi memorabilia at his Imperial Palace
Hotel and Casino had resulted in a ``living nightmare'' for his
family, friends and employees.
   ``Let me say once again, for everyone to hear, I despise Hitler
and everything he stood for,'' Engelstad told a news conference.
``I can't tell you how much I regret my insensitivity on this point.
   ``It was innocent, but it was very, very bad judgment and it was
in very bad taste. I now realize that and I deeply regret it and
apologize for it.''
   Engelstad read a seven-page statement, then left without
answering questions.
   Reporters were then allowed to go in the room where the
memorabilia was stored. Included were 20 World War II-era vehicles,
including German staff cars, and murals picturing Hitler with his
staff, at the opening of the autobahn, and German soldiers marching
through the streets of Paris.
   Engelstad has one of the largest antique auto collections in the
world, which has been open to the public for years. The room of
Nazi memorabilia is adjacent to the antique cars, but has not been
opened to the public.
   The resort owner said he was preparing to open new exhibits,
including one featuring cars of former presidents, one on Rolls
Royces made in the U.S. and one focusing on the Axis powers during
the World War II era.
   Engelstad has been under fire for two weeks following reports of
the Nazi memorabilia room and the Hitler birthday parties. The
hotel owner said the reports were leaked by people who were out to
get him.
   Gaming Control Board Chairman Mike Rumbolz declined Thursday to
comment on Engelstad's admission that the parties were conducted.
   Gaming agents have visited the resort at least twice to check on
the displays. In one visit they found a printing plate for a bumper
stick which read ``Hitler Was Right.''
   Engelstad said Thursday that someone else ordered the bumper
sticker printed, and he ordered the stickers destroyed when he
learned about their existence.
   He declined to identify the person, saying ``enough people have
been pilloried by this whole mess.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers in Washington will manage
the flow of planes into O'Hare International Airport, a move to
help local controllers and clear congested skies, the
Transportation Department announced Thursday.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley announced the change one
day after the Federal Aviation Administration reduced the number of
departures and arrivals at O'Hare.
   This year, controllers at O'Hare have made 30 errors, more than
twice the mistakes recorded in 1987. Four were made since last
Friday.
   Under the plan announced late Thursday, controllers at the FAA's
Central Flow Control headquarters in Washington will monitor air
traffic at O'Hare to enforce the limit of 155 departures and
landings during daily peak hours.
   ``It may be that they delay an airplane taking off at another
facility. It may be that they slow an airplane down,'' said
transportation Deputy Secretary Mimi Dawson.
   ``I don't see it as a reprimand,'' she said. ``Chicago is an
anomaly. We feel this is an appropriate action.''
   Chicago controllers, Ms. Dawson said, will still be responsible
for directing planes to runways once they enter O'Hare's air space.
   ``We're not managing the traffic in Chicago,'' she added.
``We're not managing approaches and departures from (Washington).
We just want to make sure that the amount of traffic stays within
the limits.''
   During peak periods _ between 4:45 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. _ the
maximum number of planes allowed to depart and land in good weather
now has been reduced to 155 per hour from 180 at O'Hare.
   The plan also affects some planes at Midway Airport on the
southwest side because the airports share air space.
   Burnley said his department will study whether those limits are
effective.
   ``I have ordered these actions because today's operating
environment in the Chicago area may require new traffic management
procedures in order to assure continued safety,'' Burnley said.
   Controllers at O'Hare, the nation's busiest airport, made two
errors Friday, one Sunday and one Tuesday, the FAA said. O'Hare
controllers' 30 errors this year compared to 12 in 1987, the FAA
has said.
   In comparison, Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, the
nation's second busiest, has had just six errors this year, and
Washington's National Airport just two, officials said.
   The latest incident at O'Hare came just two months after the
National Transportation Safety Board issued a report saying that
chronic understaffing of controllers, mandatory overtime, outdated
equipment and inadequate training contributed to mistakes at O'Hare.

   Humphrey, the wayward humpback whale
who wandered up the Sacramento River three years ago, was spotted
Thursday feeding closer to shore than other migrating leviathans.
   ``We don't think he's lost or sick, he could just be feeding on
near shore fish,'' said John Calambokidis, a research biologist for
Cascadia Research Collective, which spotted the whale Saturday
morning at Drake's Bay.
   Fishermen also reported seeing what they believed to be the
40-foot humpback whale on Sunday and Tuesday.
   Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Scott Richardson said their
spotting was about 2.5 miles off Bodega Head, ``just lazying
around.''
   Cascadia's sighting marks the third consecutive year Humphrey
has been sighted officially off the Sonoma-Marin coast since the
fall of 1985, when he blundered into the tributary waters northeast
of San Francisco Bay.
   For 25 days, the 45-ton whale wandered up and down the
Sacramento River Delta, gaining national publicity, poking into
narrow sloughs and endangering his life because he was out of his
salt-water habitat.
   The scientists, part of a private nonprofit group conducting a
three-year study of humpback and blue whales, say they are sure
they spotted Humphrey. They previously spotted him in 1986 and last
year.
   Researcher Greg Falxa said that among other things the whale was
identified by multiple scarring on his dorsal fin. Humphrey also is
easily identifiable by the black and white color pattern and a
lateral scar on his 15-foot fluke.
   The only thing unusual about Humphrey's behavior is that he has
been feeding well inshore from the other migrating whales
congregating this time of the year near the Farallon Islands 26
miles off the mouth of San Francisco Bay.
   The researchers are photographing and monitoring Humphrey for
Cascadia and the Center for Whale Research.
   The Cascadia researchers are studying the populations of blue
and humpback whales and their migrations, and identifying
individual animals like Humphrey.
   ``We have found record numbers of blue whales so far and about
100 to 200 humpbacks in the area each year,'' Calambokidis said.
   After Humphrey failed to find his way to freedom in 1985, Coast
Guard and Navy vessels eventually got the whale headed in the right
direction and he cruised back into the Pacific Ocean, cheered by
hundreds of people.

   A stern Gen. Augusto Pinochet told the
nation Thursday he will stay president until his term runs out in
1990, as police fired water cannons and tear gas into crowds
celebrating his defeat in a referendum on extending his rule to
1997.
   ``Every man and woman of this country can be absolutely sure we
will carry out completely the itinerary foreseen in the
constitution,'' Pinochet said in a speech broadcast nationwide on
radio and television.
   It was his first public declaration since a resounding loss in
Wednesday's referendum. ``I recognize and accept the majority
verdict expressed yesterday by the citizenry,'' he declared.
   The authoritarian leader appeared in a white military dress
uniform. Unsmiling and head slightly bowed toward a set of
microphones, he spoke in a strong, steady voice.
   Pinochet also warned opposition leaders not to misinterpret the
vote as a mandate for them, or a rejection of an 8-year-old
constitution that called for the referendum. The referendum also
provides for Pinochet if defeated _ as he was _ to remain in office
until March 1990, when the winner of an open election planned for
late 1989 will assume power.
   ``No one can feel they have the mandate of the people to twist
what the people decided,'' he said. The constitution, crafted by
his administration, was passed in a loosely organized 1980
referendum that opposition leaders said was rife with vote fraud.
   Thousands of jubilant foes of Pinochet chanted ``He has
fallen!'' and marched in confetti-strewn streets to celebrate their
ballot-box victory over the military ruler.
   ``An authoritarian system has been overthrown,'' said Ricardo
Lagos, a leader of a 16-party coalition that campaigned for
Pinochet's defeat in a yes-or-no plebiscite.
   Some marches turned violent.
   While tens of thousands of Chileans demonstrated peacefully at a
nearby park and plaza, hundreds of youths near the government
palace hurled bottles and sticks at police, and dragged wood planks
and other debris onto downtown streets.
   Riot police used water cannons, setting off mad scrambles
engulfing passersby walking along nearby streets. Tear gas fumes
made many people cover their faces with handkerchiefs and office
workers closed windows 10 stories above ground.
   More than 20 people were arrested and two policemen were
injured, authorities said. Reports also said dozens of people hurt,
struck by police nightsticks or by tear gas canisters.
   A crowd of many thousands, mostly young men, packed all eight
lanes of Santiago's main boulevard for blocks in a standoff with
riot police.
   With nightfall, hundreds of demonstrators lit torches made from
rolled-up newspapers. The tightly packed crowd pressed against a
cordon of police officers who each held out fiberglass shields.
   Eventually, the crowd broke through the cordon and was
immediately dispersed by riot police. Several people were trampled
as the crowd fled and were seen lying on the ground or doubled over
in pain. No one appeared badly hurt, however.
   At 8:50 p.m. (7:50 p.m. EDT), a blackout hit downtown Santiago,
but power returned to the city in 15 minutes. The cause of the
blackout was not known immediately.
   Authorities allowed union leader Sergio Troncoso to address the
demonstrators and to urge them to remain calm.
   ``We have to be careful of the women and children who are
here,'' Troncoso said. The demonstrators yelled insults at police,
calling them ``murderers.''
   Wednesday's rejection of the army commander, who seized power in
a bloody 1973 coup, cleared the way for elections to return Chile
to democracy. The opposition urged elections be held before
December 1989, a plan that has been rejected by the still-powerful
military.
   Chile's last presidential election was in 1970, when the
president overthrown by Pinochet, Salvador Allende, a Marxist, was
elected.
   Observers expect at least two opposition candidates will run in
the presidential elections: Lagos, Socialist leader of the
center-left Party for Democracy alliance, and Patricio Aylwin,
president of the centrist Christian Democratic Party.
   Under the constitution, Pinochet will rule until the new
elections. If the military leaves power, it will further signal an
end to the military governments that have dominated South America.
   Elected civilian rule has replaced the military in Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay in the past decade. The
nearest military ruler to Chile is Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, who has
ruled Paraguay since seizing power in 1954.
   After the government conceded defeat early Thursday, all 16
Cabinet members handed in their resignations to allow Pinochet to
appoint new ministers if he wanted. The Cabinet was formed in July
1987 in part to supervise his campaign.
   With 99.6 percent of votes counted, ``no'' votes against
Pinochet's continued rule totaled 3,945,865, or 54.7 percent, while
``yes'' votes totaled 3,106,099, or 43 percent, the Interior
Ministry reported.
   Voided ballots totaled 164,427. The turnout was more than 7.2
million of the 7.4 million registered voters.
   By midmorning, small groups of students had gathered in
Santiago's streets and enthusiastically chanted anti-Pinochet
slogans.
   Initial police attempts to disperse the youngsters angered
bystanders and only attracted more participants. By noon, thousands
of demonstrators had spilled onto the city's main eight-lane
boulevard, jamming traffic as they shouted, ``Go away, Pinochet!''
and ``He has fallen!''
   Drivers beeped their horns with the chants. Other demonstrators
marched through the streets waving Chilean flags and opposition
party banners. Confetti and streamers floated down from windows of
downtown office buildings.
   In the business district, Pinochet's loss prompted a 16 percent
average decline in stock values.
   The opposition said it would negotiate with the military to move
up the date of the presidential election. They also want to strike
provisions from the constitution that leave congress virtually
powerless to amend it and give the armed forces both autonomy and a
supervisory policy-making role.
   ``It is indispensible now to elect, within a short period of
time, a president and congress with powers to modify the
constitution,'' Lagos said.

   The Congressional Black Caucus plans to issue
a ``code of conduct'' for Japanese businesses expecting sell their
products to black Americans, the caucus chairman said Thursday.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., announced at a caucus hearing
that the code, to be issued in a few weeks, will aim to correct
what he called Japanese ``economic arrogance'' and insensitivity
toward Black America.
   He said the code would be along the lines of the former Sullivan
Principles, a code of conduct intended to help the black majority
in white-ruled South Africa through training and enlightened labor
standards to which U.S. companies operating in South Africa were
asked to adhere.
   The code was named for the Rev. Leon Sullivan, a Philadelphia
civil rights leader who later announced he has decided to press for
total disengagement of U.S. corporations from South Africa.
   The forthcoming code would be aimed at Japanese corporations and
their U.S. subsidiaries, said Dymally.
   It would seek an end to racial stereotypes and caricatures
offensive to blacks, such as the ``Black Sambo'' dolls exported by
Japan, and the hiring of more blacks as executives in U.S.
factories and distributorships of Japanese concerns.
   The efforts at persuasion would be backed by a ``Buy America''
campaign during the Christmas shopping season to demonstrate the
purchasing power of U.S. blacks who, in the 1980 census, numbered
more than 26 million, he said.
   The Black Caucus approach was described as too weak by some
speakers at the hearing and unrealistic by others.
   The Afrikan-American Committee Against Japanese Racism, a
Washington-based militant activist group, announced plans to smash
Japanese consumer products in a demonstration outside the Japanese
Embassy next Monday.
   The ``slap on the wrist that the Japanese received in the form
of a verbal protest from a handful of members of Congress is not
enough,'' said Elder Yehuda, chairman of the committee, which
describes itself as a coalition of black militant organizations.
``African-Americans will not buy any more products manufactured in
Japan, from trinkets to transistors, from toasters to Toyotas,''
said Yehuda, who also advocated an end to Japanese investment in
the United States.
   But Adonis E. Hoffman, a black attorney who once worked as a
registered lobbyist for the Japanese and South Korean governments,
criticized boycotts as ``the civil rights approach'' to the problem
and said it would not succeed with the Japanese and could isolate
black business interests.
   ``Moral pressure and outrage by African-Americans will not
motivate Japan to share the wealth,'' said Hoffman, who now
represents U.S. black firms in international trade matters.
   ``There must be a minimal quid pro quo to motivate Japan to buy
into black America's business objectives,'' Hoffman said, adding
that U.S. ``black business, as a whole, has yet to establish a
track record or demonstrate the wherewithal to seriously penetrate
international markets or attract foreign capital....''
   Two Japanese concerns _ Toyota Motor Sales, USA, and the Sony
Corp. _ testified on their efforts to recognize aspirations of the
black community and promote its interests.
   Toyota has nine Hispanic or black Toyota dealerships in the
United States plus an active recruiting program to find more
minority distributors, while financing live telecasts of black
college football games, said Pat Tobin, head of a public relations
firm representing Toyota Motor Sales.
   Sony said in a statement that it has shown social responsibility
that ``compares well with that of American-owned companies that
have been sensitized to minority issues over the past three
decades.''
   Both companies said they contribute regularly to the United
Negro College Fund and similar educational programs.

   A newly released hostage is
providing a U.S. debriefing team with ``a lot of raw information''
that could be helpful in learning about Americans still held in
Lebanon, a U.S. official said Thursday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, is close to a
State Department team that is interrogating Indian professor
Mithileshwar Singh.
   Singh said he and three Americans held with him _ Jesse Turner,
41, a native of Boise, Idaho; Alann Steen, 49, of Boston; and
Robert Polhill, 54, of New York City _ were moved frequently by
their abductors to thwart efforts to locate them, the source
disclosed.
   Singh, an Indian citizen and a resident alien of the United
States, was flown to Wiesbaden Wednesday for medical checks at a
U.S. military hospital. He told medical officials he plans to
return to the United States.
   The educator was released on Monday after 20 months of
captivity, but his three American colleagues are still held.
   According to the source, Singh has ``given no indications he was
abused'' while a captive and his comments indicated that Turner,
Steen and Polhill ``are not in a life-threatening situation.''
   The source said he could release few details about the
conditions of Singh's captivity.
   Six other Americans are also missing and believed held captive
in Lebanon, as are seven other foreigners.
   The source said Singh and the three Americans ``got moved
frequently.''
   ``He was moved around at least half a dozen times.''
   ``Wherever he was before he was released, the others would not
be there now,'' said the source.
   The State Department team questioned Singh for a second day
Thursday. The source told The Associated Press that Singh has been
speaking with the special team two to three times a day, for about
an hour and a half in each sitting.
   He said the interrogators are members of a ``standard debriefing
team'' used to question released hostages.
   Asked if they included FBI or CIA officials, the source said
only: ``You're not out of the ballpark.''
   He reiterated that Singh had no contact with American hostages
other than Turner, Steen and Polhill.
   All four taught at Beirut University College. Gunmen posing as
police abducted them on Jan. 24, 1987, on the campus in Moslem west
Beirut.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibility and said it freed Singh as a
goodwill gesture.
   According to the official, the four captives apparently had
little contact with the outside world.
   ``As far as they (the U.S. questioners) know, he had no
newspapers,'' said the official.
   Singh has not spoken with reporters since arriving in West
Germany.
   ``He's reticent to talk in public. He doesn't know how those
holding his friends would react,'' said the source.
   No sign has emerged from Singh's comments that other hostages
would be released soon, he added _ ``We had no indications anybody
else will be released soon or at all.''
   The source added: ``There are indications that they (the
hostage-takers) are backed by Iran, we assume financed by Iran.''
   Earlier Thursday, U.S. Air Force spokesman Master Sgt. Charles
Fick said Singh was receiving medical treatment.
   ``Mr. Singh says he feels much better today,'' Fick reported.
   On Wednesday, Air Force medical officials said Singh suffered
from ``tremendous fatigue'' following his captivity.

<DATELINE>NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party bosses of
Yugoslav's Vojvodina province were ousted Thursday night as a
stone-throwing crowd of 30,000 people attacked their headquarters.
   The provincial leaders had promised to resign after a meeting
with Serbian leaders earlier Thursday in the most dramatic
development in three months of mass street protests over ethnic
strife and an economic crisis.
   The development boosted a drive by Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest
republic, for tighter control over its two autonomous provinces,
Vojvodina and ethnically troubled Kosovo.
   At least 41 people, including 14 policemen, were injured when
the crowd outside the headquarters in this provincial capital of
Novi Sad surged toward riot police guarding the building, hurling
stones and breaking 20 windows.
   State-run news media said two policemen were seriously hurt and
six people were hospitalized. Four people were reported arrested.
   The protesters, who held vigil outside the headquarters for two
days, began to disperse after the leadership stepped down.
   Witnesses said police rebuffed an attempt by the crowds
overnight Wednesday to force their way into the provincial Central
Committee building.
   Tanjug, the official news agency, said the Vojvodina party
committee voted 87-10 to dismiss the 15-member Politburo, the
highest political body in the province. Two members abstained in a
meeting attended by 99 of the committee's 127 members.
   Provincial party leader Milovan Sogorov said a 10-member
provisional group would be established while new leaders were
chosen for Vojvodina, a flat, fertile area that produces most of
the nation's grain.
   Tanjug said the provincial leadership promised to resign after
meeting with Serbian party leaders in Belgrade, the nation's
capital 40 miles to the south.
   The agency quoted the Serbian party as saying: ``The Vojvodina
leadership has been deaf to the demands of the working class and
other citizens. A serious split has occurred between the Vojvodina
leadership and the people.''
   Outside the party headquarters in Novo Sad, protesters waved
Yugoslav flags and shouted complaints about low wages and declining
living standards. Strikes and worker protests have become
commonplace because of 217 percent annual inflation, 15 percent
unemployment and austerity plans imposed because of a $21 billion
foreign debt.
   Witnesses said demonstrators sang Serbian nationalist songs and
chanted ``Police Go Away!'' ``We Are Going To Smash Windows!''
``Thieves, Thieves!'' ``We Want Freedom!'' and ``We Are With You,
Slobodan!''
   Tens of thousands of Serbs have rallied almost daily for three
months in support of efforts by Serbian party leader Slobodan
Milosevic to assert more authority in the provinces.
   Mass protests in Novi Sad started in response to the provincial
party leadership's decision to discipline two members for
supporting Milosevic, Tanjug said.
   In Kosovo, Serbs, a largely Christian minority, claim harassment
by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people and are predominantly Moslem. The southern province borders
on Albania.
   Gen. Nikola Ljubicic, a member of Yugoslavia's federal
presidency and a former defense minister, told Serbian party
leaders Thursday that ``emergency measures'' should be taken to
stop the unrest but was not specific.
   ``I am concerned about today's rally in Novi Sad,'' Tanjug
quoted him as saying. ``Will this rally be satisfied with the
decision to be taken (the resignation of Vojvodina's leadership)?
It can raise other demands. How can we control the situation?''
   Milosevic rejected the proposal and said no emergency action
should be taken ``since this involves a protest of workers,''
Tanjug said.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis criticized Dan Quayle in campaign
rhetoric and commercials on Thursday, saying the Republican vice
presidential candidate appeared ``extremely insecure'' in debate.
George Bush praised his running mate's performance and outlined a
crime control program.
   Quayle shook off a poll suggesting that Democrat Lloyd Bentsen
beat him handily in their debate Wednesday night and said the
Republicans are ``still ahead'' in the race for the White House.
Most pre-debate surveys gave Bush a slight advantage over Dukakis
with a little over a month remaining in the campaign.
   Bentsen preferred an instant ABC pollrating him the debate
winner by 51 percent to 27 percent. ``I was just delighted,'' said
the Texas senator. That finding was reinforced by a CBS poll
Thursday that found Bentsen the winner by 50 to 27. The CBS poll
found Quayle was rated as qualified to be president by 47 percent,
up from 37 percent who rated him qualified before the debate.
Bentsen was rated as qualified by 78 percent, up from 64 percent.
   In Memphis, Dukakis turned Quayle's performance against George
Bush, saying: ``There are as we know, going to be major changes in
the Supreme Court. Do you want the man who selected Dan Quayle to
be making those appointments?''
   The highlight of the debate came as the 41-year-old Quayle said
his experience in Congress compared favorably with John F.
Kennedy's record at the time of the 1960 campaign.
   ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy,'' Bentsen shot back.
   The Dukakis campaign rushed to air two television commercials
questioning Quayle's qualifications. One showed pictures of Harry
Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, all vice presidents who
succeeded to the presidency without an election, while an announcer
said Bush's pick of Quayle as running mate marked a ``lapse of
judgment.''
   Dukakis told reporters aboard his campaign jet en route to Texas
the debate was a ``real plus for us'' and called Quayle's
performance ``very disturbing.''
   ``I thought he was programmed beyond belief ... extremely
insecure, this fellow,'' Dukakis said in Lone Star, Texas, where he
campaigned together with Bentsen. ``He didn't have a sense of
strength or control or anything. ... Thinking about Quayle being a
heartbeat away from the presidency, to watch that, I think, is
very, very troubling.''
   Republicans from Ford to Ronald Reagan rallied to Quayle's cause
as the Bush organization appeared to be practicing damage control.
   Bush aides conspiculously violated their rule about publicly
discussing polls. Campaign manager Lee Atwater said the vice
president was ahead in Michigan and New Jersey, two key swing
states. He predicted the vice president would carry Bentsen's home
state of Texas by at least six points.
   ``This race is going to quickly get back to the two candidates
for president,'' Atwater said. ``There are two gladiators in the
arena that are going to count in the end.''
   In Midland, Texas, campaign signs distributed to children
attending a Bush campaign rally said, ``Dan's no JFK. Thank God.''
   Bush delivered his first speech of the day on crime without
mention of his running mate or the debate. Instead, he ridiculed a
Massachusetts prison furlough program by mimicking tough-guy actor
Clint Eastwood's popular refrain ``make my day.''
   ``My opponent's answer is slightly different,'' Bush said. ``His
motto is: `Go ahead, have a nice weekend.''
   He praised Quayle's performance as he warmed up for a morning
jog, though, and later told a rally in Midland, Texas, ``I think
Dan Quayle did an outstanding job.''
   And Thursday evening in Little Rock, Ark., Bush took up Quayle's
case again. ``He did an outstanding job and he has been unfairly
pounded by my opponents,'' he said.
   Reagan, coming to Quayle's defense, said Bentsen resorted to a
``cheap shot ... unbecoming a senator of the United States'' with
his much-quoted debate put-down of the GOP vice presidential
candidate.
   Bentsen disputed any suggestion of nastiness on his part.
   ``What happened there was Quayle kept comparing himself to
Kennedy, and he overreached himself and I got fed up with it,'' the
Texas senator told reporters.
   However, Bentsen threw his jab after Quayle's one and only
reference to Kennedy in the 90-minute debate. One Democratic aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bentsen and his debate
advisers had honed the remark in practice sessions.
   An Associated Press panel of six veteran debate judges
unanimously rated Bentsen the debate winner, 148-125. They said
Quayle got off to a good start, but failed to buttress his
arguments with specifics or refute Bentsen's charges that he voted
repeatedly against the environment, programs for poor children and
veterans.
   While the Kennedy comment drew the most attention, one judge,
Stephen Mancuso of the University of Michigan, said Quayle's
biggest drawback was his repeated inability to explain the first
steps he would take if he suddenly became president.
   Bush's first stop of the day was at Texas Christian University,
where he denounced Dukakis and castigated ``liberal experimentation
with crime.'' He said he would add $250 million a year to the
budget for the next four years for prisons to ``incarcerate the
hardened felons and rising number of drug offenders.''
   Adviser Deborah Steelman said the street gang proposal would
cost about $50 million and would coordinate existing efforts by
federal, state and local law enforcement authorities.
   After the speech, Bush went jogging with students at the
university, and was asked about the debate.
   He said he felt ``as good as I did last night, which is very,
very good.'' He said Quayle ``answered the questions, he was
knowledgeable, he did an outstanding job and the American people
know it.''
   Asked about Bentsen's Kennedy comment, Bush said, ``I'm not
going to tell you what I think about that because I'm out here to
have some fun.''
   Quayle sought to turn the tables on Bentsen at a rally in
Joplin, Mo.
   He said the Democrat had a chance to ``address whether he would
continue the extreme liberal policies of Gov. Dukakis if he took
over the presidency. ... He waffled, shuffled, ducked and dived.''

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for the Soviet Union and the U.S.
government joined forces in federal appeals court Thursday, arguing
that international relations will suffer if an American
businessman's lawsuit is upheld.
   ``We have been working very closely with the Soviets and we have
made wonderful progress,'' said Justice Department attorney Douglas
Letter. ``It's important that this progress not be set back.''
   He was addressing a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which is considering the case of Raphael
Gregorian, an American denounced by the Soviets and barred from
doing business in Moscow after 14 years.
   One of the judges, Stephen Reinhard, bristled at the mention of
foreign relations saying, ``Isn't that something we're supposed to
ignore _ the political considerations _ in reaching our decision?''
   Gregorian has sued the Soviets for libel. The Soviets have
resisted and the U.S. State Department has sided with the Soviets,
saying they may not be sued for libel in the United States.
   Gregorian's attorney, Gerald Kroll, ridiculed the contention
that the case endangers U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``I personally think they have bigger people to fry than my
client,'' Kroll told the court. ``I've never heard that we couldn't
conclude an arms agreement because of Raphael Gregorian.''
   John Mage, a New York attorney representing the Soviets,
insisted that U.S. courts do not have jurisdiction because
incidents involving Gregorian did not occur in the United States.
He also said the nation is immune from suit as a foreign sovereign.
   ``It's really two against one,'' Kroll said of the U.S. and
Soviet alignment in court. He has expressed bitterness over the
government's abandonment of one of its own citizens in the legal
proceedings.
   ``I look at this as a contest of politics versus justice,'' said
Kroll. ``There's never been a case exactly like this before.''
   Gregorian's problems began in 1984 when, after a 14-year
amicable relationship, the Soviets suddenly revoked Gregorian's
permit to sell medical supplies in the Soviet Union. Until then,
his California International Trade Corp., based in Palo Alto,
Calif., had done a thriving business exporting such items as kidney
dialysis machines, heart-lung machines and batteries for heart
pacemakers.
   Soon after revoking his permit, the Soviets, through the
official newspaper Izvestia, printed a story denouncing Gregorian
as a ``duplicitous negotiatior,'' accusing him of bribery and
smuggling and intimating he was a U.S. spy.
   Gregorian, adamant about his innocence, took an unprecedented
action, suing the Soviet Union for libel in U.S. courts. He also
demanded that the Soviets pay for medical equipment still in Moscow.
   The Soviet defendants at first ignored the suit. But in 1985,
U.S. District Judge David Kenyon entered a default judgment against
them in Los Angeles, awarding Gregorian total damages of $413,000.
   Of that amount, $250,000 was for libel.
   The Soviets refused to pay. Kroll said he would seize Soviet
assets, and to dramatize his claim, he took custody of a typewriter
at an Izvestia correspondent's Washington, D.C., home as partial
payment.
   Then, Soviet and U.S. State Department lawyers went to court.
The Soviet agency V.O. Medexport, which did business with
Gregorian, asserted its immunity from suit under the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act and moved to reverse the judgment.
   On April 5, 1987, Kenyon dismissed his own libel judgment,
ruling that he did not have jurisdiction because of immunity
considerations. However, he let stand his ruling the Soviets should
meet their contractual obligation to pay for the medical supplies.
   Kroll appealed the ruling on libel to the 9th Circuit. The
Soviets appealed the contractual award, as well as disputing the
libel claim.
   Kroll's argument is based on a theory that libel in connection
with a commercial activity is exempt from immunities act and must
be tried as a civil claim in U.S. courts.
   New York attorney Martin Popper, who represents the Soviets,
said in his legal brief that there is no precedent for such a claim.
   ``Plaintiffs fail to cite a decision of any court in the entire
world (including the United States) that has asserted jurisdiction
on a claim of libel against a foreign sovereign,'' Popper said.
   The Justice Department's brief sided with the Soviets, saying
``Congress did not intend that foreign states could be sued for
claims of libel.''
   An additional view on the case has come from the Washington
Legal Foundation, a public interest law and policy center which
filed a friend of the court brief for Gregorian.
   ``WLF believes that the outrageous nature of the lies published
by defendants-appellants is such that they should be held
accountable,'' the foundation's lawyers argued. A ruling for the
Soviets, they said, would reduce the ability of U.S. courts to
protect the rights of citizens doing business overseas.

   Michael Dukakis on Thursday trumpeted
his running mate's performance in the vice presidential debate and
characterized George Bush as a ``weak candidate'' and Dan Quayle as
``extremely insecure'' and ``programmed beyond belief.''
   The harsh attack on the Republican ticket by the Democratic
presidential nominee came during a flight from Boston to Texas and
at a rally in East Texas with his sidekick, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen.
   It continued in Memphis, Tenn., where Dukakis told a rally:
``There are as we know, going to be major changes in the Supreme
Court. Do you want the man who selected Dan Quayle to be making
those appointments?''
   ``My friends, strong presidents look for strong vice
presidents,'' Dukakis told about 2,500 people gathered in this
depressed steel town. ``Weak candidates look for something else.''
   Dukakis, with a sparkling lake and the struggling Lone Star
Steel Co. plant as a backdrop, was in a jubilant mood as he praised
Bentsen and asked voters to judge the presidential standardbearers
on the strength of their running mates.
   ``When a nominee selects his running mate, he's choosing the
first member of his Cabinet, the first member of the National
Security Council and the first member of his diplomatic team,''
said Dukakis.
   ``You've got to choose somebody who's ready to step into that
Oval Office at a moment's notice and who know's what he's going to
do when he gets there,'' Dukakis said in a swipe at Quayle's
responses when asked repeatedly what he would do if suddenly
elevated to the presidency.``There was only one man on that stage
last night who fit that bill and his name is Lloyd Bentsen,''
Dukakis said. He referred to picking a running mate as a nominee's
``first presidential decision'' and asked:
   ``Judge us by the way we made it and who we chose. Ask yourself
which one of us fulfilled our presidential obligation.''
   Dukakis, whose campaign was seeking to capitalize on Bentsen's
performance by airing two ads attacking Quayle's qualifications for
the vice presidency, said the Quayle selection ``isn't the first
time that George Bush has failed,'' and then cited what he called
Bush failures in the Iran-Contra scandal, the war on drugs, trade
relations with Japan, and reforms in the nation's banking industry
and regulatory practices.
   ``It was very disturbing,'' Dukakis said while en route to
Texas. ``I thought he was programmed beyond belief ... extremely
insecure, this fellow. He didn't have a sense of strength or
control or anything. ... Thinking about Quayle being a heartbeat
away from the presidency, to watch that, I think, is very, very
troubling.''
   Dukakis briefly touched on his economic promises and vowed to
bring work back to Lone Star, which the campaign says has lost
5,000 steel jobs in the Reagan years.
   But he spent most of his time discussing the debate, chiding
Quayle for accepting massive foreign investment in U.S. real estate
and business.
   ``As Senator Bentsen said so wisely and well, we cannot let
others take over our economic destiny,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis aides said neither of the new ads featured excerpts from
the debate but that one portrayed Bentsen as the clear winner of
the event and raised questions about Quayle's qualifications. The
second ad raises the issue of whether Quayle is qualified to be ``a
heartbeat away'' from the presidency.
   Both were to debut Thursday night, joining a host of other
Dukakis ads in the campaign's largest advertising foray to date.
   The Democratic campaign issued a four-page statement labeling
many of Quayle's debate responses as inaccurate or misleading.
   The statement challenged Quayle's debate assertions that he was
concerned about the environment by citing votes against the
Superfund, asbestos cleanup, water pollution and rural drinking
water programs.
   It also accused Quayle of misrepresenting the Reagan
administration's record on poverty, drugs and human rights. It
pointed to increases in poverty and drug trafficking in the past
eight years and the administration's failure to pressure South
Africa to end its apartheid system of racial segregation.

<HEAD>Soviets To Produce More Wine, Beer, Cognac In 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   In a major change for President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's anti-drinking campaign, the Kremlin is planning to
increase production of beer, wine, cognac and champagne by up to 38
percent to meet popular demand, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   However, the Trud labor daily said the government crusade has
gone so far it will be difficult to significantly increase alcohol
production soon.
   The drive was launched two months after Gorbachev took power as
Communist Party chief in March 1985.
   ``We have to restore a significant part of production, and
that's complicated,'' Alexander S. Konobov, deputy chief of the
Ministry of Trade's food division, told the newspaper.
   Gorbachev in 1985 ordered a reduction in the production of vodka
and other alcoholic beverages, an increase in their price, an
increase in the minimum drinking age to 21 and cuts in the hours
and numbers of stores that could sell alcohol.
   He has since cited the campaign as a major reason in the
increased life expectancy for Soviet men. But the anti-drinking
drive has provoked nationwide grumbling, and even indignation,
because Soviets now must stand in long lines just to buy an
occassional bottle of wine or beer.
   Cuts in government alcohol production also have proved a bonanza
for the country's moonshiners. Sugar now must be rationed in many
cities because of shortages caused by the thousands of Soviets who
use it to produce ``samogon,'' or home brew.
   Konobov said the goal set by the 1985 anti-drinking drive was
``noble,'' but that it has been pursued by bureaucratic means.
   ``So it is obvious that corrections are necessary,'' he said.
   According to Trud, the Ministry of Trade has proposed for next
year to increase wine production by 38 percent, to 675 million
gallons; beer, by 12 percent, to 1.8 billion gallons; cognac, by 28
percent, to 33.2 million gallons, and champagne, by 9 percent, to
58 million gallons.
   The newspaper said vodka and other strong drinks would continue
to be manufactured in quantities laid down by a government decree
in 1985.
   Plans also call for more spirits to be imported from Cuba, one
of the world's biggest rum producers, and from Bulgaria, Hungary
and other countries, Konobov said.
   According to figures released by the official Tass news agency,
there are more than 4.5 million officially registered alcoholics in
the Soviet Union, and the total number is believed to be much more.
   As one of the new methods being tried to discourage alcohol
abuse, Soviet television on Tuesday night broadcast a U.S.
television movie titled ``Life of the Party,'' starring Carol
Burnett, which told the true-life story of an American woman who
joined Alcoholics Anonymous to beat the bottle.

<HEAD>Opposition Says New Law Gives Ortega Dictatorial Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders said Thursday a new
emergency law gives President Daniel Ortega dictatorial powers and
is likely to be applied soon.
   The law, approved Wednesday by the National Assembly, gives the
president authority to declare a state of emergency and restrict
civil rights for reasons of war, economic crisis or national
disaster. It took effect immediately.
   U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, have been fighting to
overthrow the leftist government since 1981 and Nicaragua is in an
economic crisis.
   The opposition in the 96-seat assembly said in a statement that
the law bestows on Ortega ``too great a concentration of
extraordinary powers,'' making him an ``absolute dictator.''
   Erick Ramirez, president of the Social Christian Party, said,
``The new law consolidates the dictatorial and totalitarian state,
and just as in the Chile of (President Gen. Augusto) Pinochet, the
Nicaraguan people should say `No' to the Sandinistas.''
   Chileans voted Wednesday against letting Pinochet extend his
15-year rule.
   Ramirez complained that the law ``legalizes repression against
the internal opposition to consolidate the power of the Sandinistas
and gives the U.S. Congress arguments for pushing military aid for
the Contras.''
   Both Ramirez and Enrique Gurdian, acting president of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, the country's main opposition
group, said the government could be expected to apply the law soon.
   An emergency decree was in effect in Nicaragua most of the time
from March 1982 until shortly after a regional peace plan was
signed by the five Central American presidents in August 1987.
   The decree's provisions included press censorship, suspension of
some civil rights, and searches without warrants.
   The new law goes further. It allows the president to close news
media and theaters; intervene in mail or electronic correspondence;
take over private vehicles and businesses; make preventive arrests,
and prevent individuals from entering or leaving the country.
   It gives the president authority to expand or reduce his own
authority to take the steps and to continue the measures until the
reasons for them disappear.
   The law says certain basic rights cannot be suspended. They
include the rights to life, equality, freedom of conscience,
asylum, thought and religion, to be presumed innocent until proven
guilty, to have personal property, and to be free from slavery in
prison.
   The National Assembly on Thursday also approved legislation
banning the receipt of any type of assistance approved by the U.S.
Congress and destined for opposition groups, the Roman Catholic
church, labor unions and individuals.
   Under the law, any person found to have accepted U.S. assistance
could face between four and 12 years imprisonment.
   President Reagan signed a new $27 million, six-month,
non-military aid package for the Contras Oct. 1.
   On Tuesday, Honduras asked the United Nations to set up an
international peace force to take Contras and leftist Salvadoran
rebels from its territory. It said the rebels should be taken first
to Costa Rica and Guatemala, then resettled elsewhere.
   Thursday in San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica, Assistant
Foreign Minister Carlos Rivera rejected that proposal.
   Rivera told reporters relocating the Contras in Costa Rica would
violate that country's principles of neutrality. The only way the
proposal could be considered would be for the rebels to abandon the
war and become refugees or political exiles, Rivera said.
   A rebel leader said Thursday that some Contras in Honduras were
returning to Nicaragua. Enrique Bermudez said in a telephone
interview from Miami that ``our troops are returning to their
original positions'' inside Nicaragua.
   The report could not be immediately confirmed. A rebel spokesman
in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, acknowledged some Contra
forces had returned to Nicaraguan border provinces but declined to
provide details. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Contras have used base camps on the Honduran side of the border
since they began fighting in 1981 to overthrow the Sandinista
government.

   Vice President George Bush leads Michael Dukakis
47 percent to 41 percent in Washington state, according to a poll
released Thursday, but the gap between the two candidates was
closed by a nearly six-point margin of error.
   The poll, conducted for KING 5 News by Delta Research, says Bush
leads Dukakis in all geographic regions of the state, including
Seattle, where the margin is 48 percent to 41 percent.
   Between Sept. 30 and Oct. 2, Delta Research polled 300 likely

<HEAD>Sadat Slaying Marked With Call for Israeli Talks With PLO</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A peace group founded in memory of Anwar Sadat
marked the seventh anniversary of the Egyptian president's
assassination Thursday by calling on Israel to hold direct talks
with Palestinians, including the PLO.
   The New York-based Sadat Peace Foundation also urged Israel to
permit municipal elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
for the first time in 12 years.
   Foundation President James George accused right-wing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of violating agreements reached by Sadat
and Israel's then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin in a 1979 peace
treaty.
   Speaking at a news conference, George cited from a letter signed
by both Begin and Sadat providing for withdrawal of Israeli troops
from the territories and guaranteed elections of ``a self-governing
authority'' there.
   ``How can you expect another Arab leader to place his trust and
to negotiate with Israel, when Israel under (Shamir's) leadership
has violated its guarantees to President Sadat?'' asked George, a
former Canadian ambassador to Iran from 1977 to 1979.
   The Sadat Peace Foundation was founded in 1984 by Sadat's widow
Jihan and American admirers of the Egyptian leader, who was gunned
down by Moslem extremists on Oct. 6, 1981. It includes members from
Israel, Egypt, other Arab countries, North America and Europe.
   On Thursday, the group called on Israel to hold immediate talks
without preconditions with Palestinian representatives, including
members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``We should accept any delegaton the Palestinians give to us.
Both sides should accept any delegaton and if it's the PLO, so be
it,'' said Rustum Hussein Bastuni, an Israeli Arab and former
Israeli legislator.
   George said Israel should convene municipal elections in the
occupied territories as soon as possible to permit the emergence of
a grassroots Palestinian leadership with whom Israel can talk peace.
   The occupied territories, where 283 Palestinians have died in a
10-month-old rebellion against Israel's 21-year occupation, have
not held municipal elections since 1976.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the prospects for Palestinian elections in the
territories ``depended on the situation there next year.''
   The territories, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, were taken by
Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.

   The recently elected chairman of the
Organization of African Unity called for an international
conference on African debt during a meeting with President Reagan
Thursday, a U.S. official said.
   Kenneth Brown, deputy assistant secretary of state for African
Affairs, said Moussa Traore, the president of Mali, told Reagan
that he ``wants to avoid a confrontation between debtors and
creditors.''
   Brown referred enquiries about the details of Traore's proposal
to officials of Mali. At the Embassy of Mali, an aide said all of
the officials familiar with the proposal were with Traore and could
not be reached.
   ``His party would have to speak primarily for him, but he would
like to see an international conference on African debt and made
that known during the meeting,'' Brown said. ``He wants to avoid a
confrontation between debtors and creditors and that's why he was
stressing this global approach.''
   Brown said Reagan and other U.S. officials at the meeting
``discussed the U.S. approach in terms of dealing with individual
cases, case by case, and our interest in trying to encourage those
who are serious about reforming their economy and not necessarily
rewarding the worst performers.''
   Brown said Reagan expressed concern that Libya, which has been
involved in war with Chad in the Western Sahara, is developing the
capacity to produce chemical weapons. He said the president
emphasized ``the need for all of us to be vigilant in that regard.''
   The United States has previously expressed concern that Libya
has a plant that may be approaching capability to produce such
weapons.
   ``We have an interest therefore in an international approach to
take mesures against the use of such weapons,'' Brown said.
   The president proposed an international conference on the
subject during his speech to the United Nations General Assembly
last week.
   In remarks at a welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn of the
White House, Reagan praised Mali's economic reform program, which
has made the impoverished West African nation a major African
recipient of U.S. economic aid.
   Since becoming chairman of the OAU at the African summit in May,
he told Traore, ``You have already demonstrated your interest in
helping to promote regional settlements in Southern Africa and the
Western Sahara.''
   ``We hope the OAU can play an even more active role in solving
those regional problems and play a key role in promoting
development in Africa by encouraging economic reform and
cooperation,'' he said.
   Traore, in his response, said he was ``convinced ... that our
discussions will enable us to make progress in the search for a
solution to the problems which are of concern to both our sides.''
   As he posed for photographs with Traore before their closed
meeting, Reagan responded to a question about human rights in
Africa by saying, ``I think we are sitting beside a man in whose
country that is a major goal.''
   Brown said the two leaders met privately for half an hour and
then met in a larger group for an additional half hour.
   At a state dinner for Traore on Thursday night, Reagan said he
was ``gratified that you share our concern about regional stability
and economic development in Africa'' and added that the United
States would ``continue to work with you and be as supportive as we
can in these areas.''
   Responding to the president's toast, Traore, speaking in French,
said through an interpreter that the OAU would continue to seek
``the taking down of the intolerable system of apartheid'' in South
Africa. He said also that it was ``urgent to find a just and
lasting solution to the problem of the African debt.''

   A Texas company and two of its executives were
accused Thursday of participating with a Postal Service governor in
a contract bid-rigging scheme that included replacing the
postmaster general.
   The replacement of Paul N. Carlin with Albert V. Casey as
postmaster general was engineered in 1986 as part of the elaborate
effort by Recognition Equipment Inc. to get $400 million worth of
contracts to provide automated mail-sorting equipment, according an
indictment returned here.
   The indictment charged that the company; REI's chairman, William
G. Moore Jr.; and Robert W. Reedy, a vice president, conspired with
Peter E. Voss, then vice chairman of the Postal Service board of
governors, and others to manipulate bid procedures, obtain
confidential information about competitors and replace Carlin,
considered an obstacle to REI winning contracts.
   An unindicted co-conspirator, Voss received $19,000 in kickbacks
plus $4,000 worth of airline tickets from a Detroit-area public
relations firm headed by John R. Gnau Jr. that REI hired on Voss'
recommendation, the indictment said.
   Voss, who received a four-year sentence for his 1986 guilty plea
in the case, also was promised one-quarter of one percent of any
revenues REI earned from Postal Service contracts, it said.
   The indictment charged that through Voss, REI arranged for the
Postal Service in 1985 to halt procurement of a multiline optical
character reader system and set up a two-step test period to give
it another chance to win the lucrative order.
   After the procurement scheme came to light in 1986, the Postal
Service ultimately decided to give the revised contract to
ElectroCom Automation Inc., which had beat out REI for the earlier
phase of the contract.
   But if REI had won the competition, it would have been
positioned to obtain procurement contracts worth $4.6 billion over
the next five years, said Postal Service spokesman James Van Loozen.
   Voss, who headed President Reagan's 1980 Ohio presidential
campaign, pleaded guilty to charges he took kickbacks totaling at
least $30,000 on four Postal Service contracts and expense account
fraud.
   Gnau, another unindicted co-conspirator who headed Reagan's 1980
Michigan campaign, received a three-year sentence for conspiracy
and for paying an illegal $2,500 gratuity to Voss.
   Gnau agreed to cooperate with the investigation along with
another executive of his firm, Michael B. Marcus, who received a
six-month sentence for paying illegal gratuities to Voss.
   Van Loozen said the bid rigging scandal delayed procurement of a
new optical mail-scanner system for about 14 months. The system is
now expected to be completely installed next May.
   In sentencing memos filed in the earlier cases, prosecutors
estimated that the bid-rigging activities of Voss and Gnau cost the
Postal Service hundreds of millions of dollars the agency planned
to save through automation.
   The indictment charged REI, Moore, 49, and Reedy, 46, both of
Dallas, with conspiracy to defraud the government, theft of Postal
Service property, mail and wire fraud and aiding and abetting.
   Moore and Reedy each face maximum possible prison terms of 33
years and fines of more than $1.5 million if convicted. The company
could be fined more than $3 million if convicted.
   REI spokeswoman Jenny Barker said, ``Neither the company nor Mr.
Moore nor Mr. Reedy have done anything wrong. We do not believe the
indictment should have been brought by the U.S. attorney.''
   ``The company, Mr. Moore and Mr. Reedy intend to defend this
matter to the fullest extent. We are confident we will be
exonerated,'' she said.
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stevens said: ``Public
corruption is one of democracy's worst enemies. This indictment
represents our commitment to prosecute aggressively and vigorously
those who seek to strike at the heart of fairness in the
procurement process by corrupting the machinery of government for
personal financial gain.''
   According to the indictment, William A. Spartin, president of
Gnau & Associates, who also headed an executive placement firm,
influenced the selection of a new postmaster by obtaining
management consulting contracts with the Postal Service.
   Spartin, also named an unindicted co-conspirator, used his
position ``to insinuate himself into the confidence of high-level
USPS and board officials'' but concealed his relationship to Voss,
Gnau and REI.
   Casey _ who became postmaster general in January 1986 and served
only seven months until early August 1986 _ was one of three
candidates that Spartin recommended, through Voss, as a replacement
for Carlin.
   Spartin, who concealed from Casey his interest in REI's effort
to get a mail-sorting contract, also was instrumental in the
removal of James V. Jellison, a deputy postmaster general who was
also regarded as an obstacle, the indictment charged.
   Spartin is also cooperating with authorities in the
investigation, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The procurement scheme began to unravel when some postal
inspectors aboard a commercial airline noticed Voss traveling in
coach, even though postal governors were allowed to fly first
class, sources said.
   Tracing his expense account vouchers, inspectors discovered that
Voss had collected reimbursement for $70,000 worth of first-class
air travel when he spent only $26,000 on coach seats, a prosecutor
said when Voss pleaded guilty to embezzlement.
   Casey was succeeded as postmaster general in August 1986 by New
York businessman Preston R. Tisch. He held the job until Anthony M.
Frank, a San Francisco banker, took over last March 1.

   Iran's foreign minister said Thursday
progress was made in recent Iran-Iraq peace talks, but he still
accused Iraq of balking on some issues and declined to comment on
whether a compromise was near.
   ``The Iraqi delegation entered into substantive talks and modest
progress has been made,'' said Ali Akbar Velayati after separate
meetings in New York with the Iraqi side and with Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``I cannot go into details, but I can tell you the situation is
better now than in the beginning,'' he told a news conference.
   Asked about the release of U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian
extremists in Lebanon, he said, ``I categorically deny there are
any talks between the United States and Iran and no talks on the
hostage issue.''
   Velayati said he was willing to resume talks in Geneva with
Perez de Cuellar's representative and with Iraq on Oct. 26 or Oct
27, if requested by the U.N. chief. Iraq agreed to only one
negotiating session in New York.
   Iraq and Iran renewed peace talks Saturday at U.N. headquarters
in New York after a session in Geneva from Aug. 25 to Sept. 13. The
talks followed a cease-fire Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old war, which
left at least 1 million killed or wounded.
   
   Velyati emphasized he was not fully satisfied with the outcome
of meetings with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and blamed Iraq
for introducing what he called extraneous issues.
   ``I am not altogether pleased or greatly encouraged in the pace
of the talks,'' Velayati said. He added that both sides have not
yet ``been able to achieve the goals that the secretary-general had
set.''
   These goals are formalization of the cease-fire, withdrawal by
both sides to international boundaries and repatriation of
prisoners of war, under terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution
598.
   Velayati avoided a direct answer when asked if a compomise deal
had been struck, in which Iran would halt searching neutral
shipping in the gulf, as reported by U.N. sources.
   In turn, the sources said, Iraq would postpone discussion of
sovereignty over the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway between the
two nations.
   U.N. sources have reported that such a deal, arranged by the
secretary-general, was virtually in place and could break the
deadlock between the two sides over clearing of the Shatt al-Arab,
sovereignty over the channel and other issues.
   Velayati did not deny a deal in the future but emphasized that
for the time being Iran would not give up its right to search
suspect ships in time of war.

<HEAD>Myerson Case: What the Law Clerk Heard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While a state judge was ruling favorably in the
divorce case of Bess Myerson's lover, the former Miss America was
calling the judge on an unlisted, private line, the judge's former
law clerk testified Thursday.
   Miss Myerson called more than a dozen times and gave an assumed
name to court personnel, the law clerk also testified at the
divorce-fixing trial of the two women and Miss Myerson's lover,
Carl ``Andy'' Capasso.
   The Capasso case was one of the few handled personally by the
judge, law clerk Howard Leventhal testified.
   Miss Myerson, Capasso and state Supreme Court Justice Hortense
Gabel each face five counts of conspiracy, mail fraud and
bribe-related charges in an alleged 1983 scheme to slash Capasso's
child support and alimony payments.
   In his second day of federal court testimony, Leventhal said
that of more than 3,000 requests to change alimony and child
support payments, the Capasso case was one of the few Mrs. Gabel
handled personally.
   ``I think I'll do this one myself, Howie,'' Leventhal said the
judge told him in July 1983 after Capasso's lawyer sought to delay
weekly alimony and child support payments of $1,850 a week to
Capasso's wife, Nancy.
   Asked if Mrs. Gabel had given similar personal attention to
other support requests, Leventhal, who was her law secretary from
1981 until her resignation last year, said: ``Maybe one or two.''
   Prosecutors charge that Miss Myerson, the city's former cultural
affairs commissioner, gave a $19,000 city job to Mrs. Gabel's
unemployed daughter, Sukhreet, in order to influence the outcome of
the judge's decision.
   Leventhal, the prosecution's second witness, testified that in
the summer of 1983, Miss Myerson began calling the judge on a
private, unlisted phone.
   Prosecutors contend that even though Miss Myerson and Mrs. Gabel
knew each other, their contacts were limited until the judge began
handling interim decisions in the Capasso divorce.
   Leventhal also said Miss Myerson often called identifying
herself either as ``Barbara Goodman or Robinson.''
   Leventhal said he didn't recognize the voice although the woman
called ``a fairly large number (of times) between a dozen and two
dozen.''
   The clerk said he asked Mrs. Gabel ``who is this Barbara
Goodman, Robinson person?'' He said the judge replied: ``Oh, that's
Bess Myerson. She's just being so Byzantine.''
   On Sept. 14, 1983, about a month after Sukhreet Gabel was made a
special assistant to Miss Myerson, the judge cut Capasso's
temporary alimony and child support payments from $1,850 to $680 a
week.
   When an Oct. 18, 1983 New York Post story reported the
``coincidence'' of Ms. Gabel's hiring by the Cultural Affairs
Department, Mrs. Gabel asked Leventhal if she should withdraw from
the Capasso case.
   ``I think it would be a good idea,'' Leventhal said he told the
judge.
   He said that Mrs. Gabel had excused herself from other cases in
the past where there had been a possible conflict of interest.

   A 10-year-old boy and a Christian
school's headmaster testified Thursday that a woman who teaches
third grade came to the defense of her youngsters by attacking a
gunman with a book.
   ``This is a .357 Magnum,'' headmaster Dan Carden quoted
defendant James L. Harvey as telling teacher Mary Alice Blanton.
   ``I don't care what it is _ get out of here,'' Carden quoted her
as replying.
   Harvey is charged with kidnapping 110 people at the West End
Christian School in Tuscaloosa on Feb. 2. Defending himself in
state court here as a crusader for people's constitutional rights,
Harvey has called Mrs. Blanton ``a fiesty lady.''
   Ten-year-old Marty Vice said he saw Mrs. Blanton encounter
Harvey and another gunman in a hallway, where she began hitting
Harvey with a book.
   The other man, described by police as an unwilling accomplice,
testified Thursday he was duped by Harvey into helping take over
the school and later was threatened with his life if he tried to
back out.
   Marty, then a fourth-grader, said he was coming out of the
bathroom when he saw two men walk in at the other end of the
hallway.
   After seeing the confrontation with Mrs. Blanton, Marty said, he
ducked into the nearest classroom. Asked why he did not return to
his own class, Marty said, ``I didn't want them to get me.''
   Carden told the jury that when he heard of the trouble, he and a
coach rushed to the elementary school building and saw Mrs. Blanton
struggling with Harvey, while he held a cocked pistol pointed
toward the ceiling.
   Carden said he and the coach then told Mrs. Blanton to do
whatever Harvey told her to do.
   John Rhodes Jr., 43, testified that he was picking up beer cans
near an unemployment office that day when Harvey offered him $50 to
help him move across town. Instead, Harvey drove him to the school,
gave him an empty gun and told him to put it in his coat pocket.
   ``He said this was something he had been planning for two or
three years,'' Rhodes said. ``What he planned I didn't know.''
Rhodes told the jury that when he and Harvey entered the school, he
told Harvey he wanted to leave.
   ``You ain't no more your own boss,'' he quoted Harvey as saying.
``You do it or die.''
   The two men entered the school at 8:30 a.m. and about 2:30 p.m.,
Rhodes said he surrendered to an officer who offered him more money
than Harvey promised. ``He asked me if $300 would do me any good. I
said yes. I gave him the gun and I walked out. I was wanting to go
anyway.''
   Kidnapping charges against Rhodes were dropped after authorities
decided he was an unwilling participant.
   Harvey surrendered after 12 hours when authorities produced a
videotape in which Gov. Guy Hunt, who is to testify Friday at
Harvey's insistence, offered a bogus pardon.
   Cross-examining six Tuscaloosa policemen who identified weapons
taken from the school, Harvey suggested the guns showed he ``was
very serious about what he believed.''
   ``I had a right to act as a steward for those children and their
future ... against pollution, deceit and people who are destroying
the Constitution of the United States,'' Harvey said while

   Cuba, Angola and South Africa will meet
Friday to discuss the implementation of the U.N. plan for Namibia's
independence, and Cuba's withdrawal of its soldiers from Angola,
the South Africans confirmed.
   The exact time and location for the talks were not determined
and it was not yet confirmed whether the U.S. State Department
would continue mediating the talks, as it has in previous meetings,
said Aubrey Dwyer, a spokesman for South Africa's U.N. Mission, on
Thursday.
   South Africa has told Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
it is ready to begin implementation on Nov. 1 of Security Council
Resolution 435 to give neighboring South-West Africa, or Namibia,
its freedom.
   Resolution 435, passed a decade ago, is a one-year plan for
national assembly elections under U.N. supervision.
   About 7,500 U.N. peacekeeping troops and 2,000 civilian support
staff are to be sent to Namibia in an operation estimated to cost
between $600 million and $700 million.
   South Africa has ruled the former German colony since World War
I. The United Nations revoked a mandate from its predecessor, the
League of Nations, and declared Pretoria's rule over Namibia
illegal.
   Complicating the plan is South Africa's insistence that about
50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola to protect that country's
Marxist government from the UNITA rebel movement should be
withdrawn in a year. UNITA stands for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
   The Cubans have reportedly compromised their initial insistence
on a four-year withdrawal down to two years, with a phased
withdrawal away from southern Angola's border with northern Namibia.
   Officials involved in the talks among the United States, Angola,
Cuba and South Africa, including U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz, have expressed confidence that a mutually acceptable
compromise will be reached on the withdrawal timetable.

<HEAD>Science Policy Maker Resigns Federal Position During Investigation</HEAD>

   A National Science Foundation official who
helped set Reagan Administration policies regulating biology
research said Thursday he is resigning to resume research, not
because the Justice Department is investigating him for possible
financial conflicts of interest.
   David T. Kingsbury, assistant director of the NSF for
biological, behavioral and social sciences for the last four years,
said he is resigning because ``I want to go back to the
laboratory.''
   He confirmed that a Justice Department investigation of his
financial interests is continuing, but said, ``That's not why I've
resigned.''
   Kingsbury formally leaves the NSF on Oct. 15, and assumes a new
position as a full professor at George Washington University on
Nov. 1. He said the university job will include continuation of a
research project that has been under way for several years and
``now is at a critical point.''
   In his letter of resignation, dated Sept. 23, Kingsbury said he
was making the move to return to research and because of ``the
stress on both the agency and me over the past year resulting from
publicity about my activities outside NSF.''
   He acknowledged that he has been accused of having improper
connections with biotechnology companies that could have been
affected by NSF policies, but denied that there is a conflict.
   Kingsbury said that shortly after his appointment to the NSF in
1984, he submitted a list of his holdings to the NSF general
counsel. He said the counsel advised him to sell only one
investment, stock in the Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif., a
biotechnology company. The other holdings were not considered to be
a conflict of interest, he said.
   Some companies in which he holds stock have been incorrectly
identified as biotechnology companies, said Kingsbury, saying,
``Whether or not they are biotechnology companies is a matter of
interpretation.''
   He identified one of his holdings as New Brunswick Scientific, a
company that he said makes laboratory equipment, but does no
biotechnology research.
   Kingsbury said he has hired an attorney to assist him in the
continuing Justice Department probe, but that the investigation
started more than a year ago and nothing has come of it.
   ``I have not been charged with any conflict of interest,'' he
said.
   The NSF announced Kingsbury's resignation last week in a
two-paragraph statement from Erich Bloch, the NSF director.
   In the statement, Bloch said the NSF would not comment on an
investigation of Kingsbury, but did note that ``concerns have
arisen and have been under consideration by the Justice Department
concerning certain of Dr. Kingsbury's financial and business
relationships, especially with regard to financial disclosure.''
   Kingsbury is a former University of California at Berkeley
researcher and a specialist in the genetics of brain ailments, such
as Alzheimer's disease. At the NSF, he has been a major influence
on policies regulating the biotechnology industry during the Reagan
administration.
   Experts representing the Environmental Defense Fund have charged
that Kingsbury helped formulate regulations that favored the
biotechnology industry and genetic experiments.
   ``Kingsbury's past history has been pro-industry,'' said Rebecca
Goldburg, an EDF scientist. She said Kingsbury and the Reagan
administration were ineffective in setting policies regulating
experiments using organisms that have been altered genetically in
the laboratory.

   Sen. Dan Quayle's answers to debate questions
about what he would do if suddenly elevated to the presidency
hardly dispelled doubts about his fitness for the No. 2 job,
several political analysts said Thursday.
   They disagreed on whether Quayle's debate performance might have
damaged the Republican Party ticket headed by George Bush, but they
said the Indiana senator clearly missed an opportunity to lay the
fitness question to rest.
   Some of the experts _ including political consultants and
political science professors _ said they felt the 41-year-old
Quayle had been over-coached by his campaign handlers, and was
therefore too programmed to cope with nettlesome and unexpected
questions.
   ``If you've ever had a close friend have to give a toast or
speech, and just couldn't do it, that's how I felt when I watched''
Quayle struggle with hypothetical questions Wednesday night about
taking over the presidency because of an emergency, said Republican
Party consultant Tom Edmonds.

   Members of John F. Kennedy's inner circle
enthusiastically agreed Thursday with Lloyd Bentsen that Dan Quayle
is ``no Jack Kennedy.'' But they gave less support to the Texas
senator's own claim of friendship with the late president.
   Lawrence F. O'Brien, who worked for Kennedy in the 1960
presidential campaign and later in the White House, said he found
Quayle's effort to compare himself to the late president ``both
laughable and pathetic.''
   Quayle can cite age, family wealth, years in Congress, and
political ambition to support his claim that his experience is
similar to Kennedy's when the Massachusetts senator ran for
president 28 years ago.
   But when he drew the comparison during the vice presidential
debate Wednesday night, Bentsen quickly retorted:
   ``I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy
was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''

   In what one official acknowledged was ``a
startling change,'' the Defense Department said Thursday it has
slashed the cost of the first phase of a Star Wars defensive shield
from $115 billion to $69 billion, and the system could be available
within a decade.
   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the figures should be viewed with ``some
skepticism'' because the cost of weapons programs often goes down
while they are in the planning stages and then rises when
production starts.
   The new figures arise from a restructuring of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, the formal name of President Reagan's
5-year-old program to develop a high-tech shield against attack by
Soviet nuclear missiles.

   The day after an Energy Department draft
report sharply criticized Savannah River Plant management, the
nuclear facility suffered an equipment failure that led to a
release of radioactive tritium gas.
   The escape of less than .01 millirems of the gas into the
atmosphere Thursday morning posed no threat to health, said plant
spokeswoman Becky Craft. Workers at the plant, the nation's only
producer of weapons-grade plutonium and tritium, were not evacuated.
   ``The tritium ... was released into the atmosphere from the
facility's stack,'' a statement issued by the plant's management
said. ``The accidental release occurred as the result of equipment
failure during routine operations inside the Tritium Facility.''
   A millirem is a measure of radiation; a routine chest X-ray
totals about 20 millirems, according to Ms. Craft.

   Four senators on Thursday asked an independent
committee to review safety and operations at the Savannah River
Plant, a South Carolina facility that produces nuclear weapons
material.
   The plant, run by E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. under contract
from the Energy Department, has come under increasing scrutiny
since disclosures last week that as many as 30 major mishaps there
over three decades had not been reported to department headquarters
or disclosed to the public.
   The alleged questionable safety and operating procedures,
detailed in internal documents from Du Pont and the department,
continued until this August, when the latest incident caused
engineers to shut down the P-Reactor at the plant. The facility's
other two reactors also have been shut down.
   ``We are very concerned about both the August 1988 incident at
P-Reactor and earlier incidents discussed in a recently disclosed
1985 Du Pont memorandum,'' said the letter, signed by Sens. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C.; James McClure, R-Idaho; Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.

   The Justice Department said Thursday that an
anti-discrimination law protecting the handicapped extends to
employees with the AIDS virus if they are in the federal workforce
or have jobs in programs receiving federal aid.
   The opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel is in line with a
Supreme Court ruling last year and the Civil Rights Restoration Act
of 1987 passed by Congress.
   The opinion also says that those with the AIDS virus in whom the
disease has progressed can be excluded from the workplace if they
pose a threat to the health or safety of others or are unable to
their job.
   Since the available medical information shows that the risk of
infection being transmitted in the normal course of the workplace
is very low, an AIDS-infected employee ``by and large ... should be
treated like any other employee,'' Assistant Attorney General
Douglas Kmiec, head of OLC, said at a news conference where he
discussed the opinion. Kmiec said an AIDS-infected employee
``should be assessed for his ability to do the job like anyone
else.''

   The House, alarmed by used syringes and vials
of AIDS-infected blood washing up on shorelines, joined the Senate
on Thursday in approving legislation to combat the dumping of
medical waste.
   ``The illegal disposal of medical waste is spreading like an
epidemic across the country,'' said the bill's floor manager, Rep.
Thomas Luken, D-Ohio. ``This waste is not just repulsive; it can
literally kill people.
   ``According to recent federal studies, as many as 18,000 people
each year may contract hepatitis B from accidental contact with
medical waste,'' he said. ``Hundreds of those infected will
ultimately die from the infection.''
   The bill, approved 390-28, would require the Environmental
Protection Agency to set up a system to track infectious or
dangerous trash from hospitals, labs and clinics to its disposal.

her $10 million Florida Lotto jackpot on Thursday said the money
will give her a sense of security but she has no plans to quit her
job.
   Elynor Purcell, 67, said she went to work Sunday, the day after
the jackpot drawing, at the turnstiles at the Calder Race Course

   ``I woke my friend Judy up and told her. I guess it was about 10

   The Environmental Protection Agency has failed
to act against tens of thousands of violations of the Safe Drinking
Water Act by local water systems, the National Wildlife Federation
said Thursday.
   ``There has been a major breakdown'' in administration of the
1974 law, said Jay Hair, executive vice president of the
federation, at a news conference.
   The federation, whose 5 million members make it the nation's
largest environmental organization, released a report of an
18-month examination of 15,000 pages of EPA computer printouts for
the 1987 fiscal year that showed 36,763 water systems committing
101,588 violations of the act. The nation has over 200,000 water
systems.
   Though the law requires that every violation be reported to
customers of the system, only 5,867 notices were issued. The
federation did not count failure to issue notices in its survey of
violations. If it had, they would have numbered 197,309.

   A Texas company and two of its executives were
accused Thursday of conspiring with a former Postal Service
governor to rig the award of $400 million in contracts for
automated mail-sorting equipment.
   The indictment charged Recognition Equipment Inc. of Irving,
Texas; REI's chairman, William G. Moore Jr.; and Robert W. Reedy, a
vice president, with participating in an elaborate scheme that
included the replacement of Paul N. Carlin as postmaster general
with Albert V. Casey in 1986.
   The indictment said the two executives conspired with Peter E.
Voss, then vice chairman of the Postal Service board of governors,
and others to manipulate bid procedures, obtain confidential
information about competitors and replace Carlin, considered an
obstacle to REI winning contracts.

   Tawana Brawley's tale of rape by a
gang of whites was a lie fanned into a source of racial tension
through the ``hucksterism and opportunism'' of her advisers, New
York's attorney general said Thursday.
   ``We have the facts. We have solved the case. The allegations
she had made are false,'' Robert Abrams said as he released copies
of an exhaustive, 170-page grand jury investigation of the black
teen-ager's story.
   The grand jury said it found no evidence of sexual assault and
said Miss Brawley herself was responsible for the degraded
condition in which she was found after a four-day disappearance
last November.

   Regulations that took effect Thursday forbidding
future police officers and firefighters in Massachusetts from
smoking either on or off the job are producing resentment and
expectations that the law will be challenged in court.
   The law, aimed at cutting health care and pension costs, is the
first of its kind in the nation. Some unions are calling it an
unconstitutional intrusion into the private lives of public
employees.
   ``This is going to get jammed up in the courts, probably the
very first time they try to enforce it,'' said Lt. Edward M.
Merrick Jr., a lobbyist for the 15,000-member Massachusetts Police
Association.
   State legislators who drafted the law agree that it is likely to
be challenged, but they maintain it can pass constitutional muster
because it affects only new recruits.

   President Miguel de la Madrid says the United
States is a difficult neighbor, but living next to such a powerful
country has made Mexico more independent.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, de la Madrid said
that during his six-year term the two countries have improved
understanding on the thorny issue of illegal drug trafficking.
Industrialized countries in general, he said, have begun to
understand that developing nations' foreign debt problems affect
the entire world economy.
   De la Madrid, 54, turns the government over to his successor,
former Budget Secretary Carlos Salinas de Gortari, on Dec. 1, after
presiding over some of the country's most difficult years. Both men
are from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has not lost
a major office since it was founded in 1929.

   Six weeks ago, Julius Tomin was so hard
up he had to pedal 100 miles by bicycle to attend a world congress
of fellow philosophers.
   Starting Thursday, Tomin had a job _ as a barroom philosopher.
   Noel Reilly is paying the 49-year-old thinker $8,500 to give
three lectures a year at his Beehive pub in Swindon, 70 miles west
of London.
   Tomin thinks the 100-year-old pub is just the sort of place
where Socrates, a poor man who went barefoot, might have engaged in
his philosophical dialogues in ancient Athens.
   The first talk by the bespectacled philosopher was a discourse
on freedom to a good-natured, occasionally boisterous but generally
reverent crowd.

   The work of Dr. Robert Xavier Williams Jr.
fills every playground, every classroom and every mother's arms for
miles around.
   Pick any woman and child on any street in Macon or Bullock
counties in rural east-central Alabama, and chances are that woman
was Williams' patient, and that child was brought into the world by
his hands.
   In big cities, expectant mothers shop for doctors or midwives
and hospitals compete for maternity business. But in rural America,
particularly the South and the West, such choices are increasingly
rare. Women often must travel for an hour or more for a doctor's
care and a hospital delivery room.
   For 15 years, Robert Xavier Williams Jr. chose to do what fewer
and fewer doctors are willing to do: he delivered babies and cared
for women in a piece of America where the need was acute, the
population poor and the facilities desperately limited.
   He delivered the future here, and his sudden death July 13 at
the age of 53 turned that future darker and more uncertain for a
generation of babies and their parents.
   ``They want to know `What do we do now?''' Annie Thomas,
Williams' office nurse, said of his legion of patients, at least
100 of whom are pregnant. ``I just inform them we don't have a
doctor in the office to see them. And the saddest part of all, we
don't even have a referring physician to send them to.''
   In Macon County, where Williams lived, there is not even a
hospital since John A. Andrew Community Hospital closed in 1987.
Williams kept his office there, the only doctor in a mostly empty
building with an overgrown lawn. But every day at dawn, he drove
along 25 miles of narrow highway to Bullock County Hospital to do
his rounds.
   After morning rounds, Williams often performed surgery, then
drove back to Tuskegee for office hours six days a week. With the
office and the three county clinics where he consulted, he might
see 1,500 patients a month and deliver an average of two babies a
day.
   At night, Williams unwound by reading medical journals. He
talked about retiring to a life of travel and golf, but no one who
knew him took him seriously.
   ``He just worked, worked, worked,'' Nurse Thomas said. ``He
wouldn't take time out to take a break or a rest or eat a decent
lunch. I think he cared more about his patients than he did
himself, I really do.''
   Williams' patients, many already suffering the effects of poor
nutrition, high blood pressure or other conditions exacerbated by
poverty, needed extra care: 90 percent were high-risk, requiring
special attention and sometimes frequent hospitalization throughout
their pregnancies.
   Their risk status went hand-in-hand with their economic status:
those with the greatest need often were the least able to pay. Most
of them were uninsured or underinsured and could not afford a ride
to his office, much less an obstetrician's bill.
   ``Try to pay me something, if it's not but a dollar a month,''
he'd tell his patients, and they never were afraid to come to him,
no matter how little they had in their pocketbooks. Those who
weren't within walking distance were often ferried to appointments
by Williams' son, Bobby, who started working in his father's office
while in 7th grade.
   The whole family helped. Wife Rita worked as office manager;
Bobby and daughters Sherri, Rita and Catherine ran errands and took
patients' blood pressure and weight. Behind their comfortable
split-level house lay another part of Williams' life they all
shared, 10 acres of land where they kept horses, cows and chickens
and grew vegetables.
   Williams, raised by his farmer grandfather, arrived at Tennessee
State University with every intention of returning to the land.
Instead, he met and married Rita, took the medical aptitude tests
as a lark and did well enough to be admitted to Meharry Medical
College in Nashville. Later, he joined the Air Force, serving at
bases in Grand Forks, N.D., and Blytheville, Ark., where he became
the first black hospital commander.
   His career was filled with honors, but he never spoke of them.
All his patients knew was that he saved their lives and he saved
their babies.

   In the nine months he worked at Bullock County Hospital, its
infant mortality rate dropped from 26 deaths per 1,000 _ among the
nation's highest _ to 5.1 deaths, half the national average.
   ``If it wasn't for him, I would be dead,'' said Pinkie Thornton,
whose last three children, and three grandchildren, were delivered
by Williams. Her most recent pregnancy was ectopic, a potentially
life-threatening condition in which the embryo develops outside the
uterus. In rare instances, the pregnancy goes to term; that is what
happened to Thornton, whose daughter, Tari, is now 5.
   When the operation was over, Williams called in six doctors, she
recalled. ``He was laughing and smiling. He was kind of happy,
because he thought he was going to lose me or something. Every last
one of the hospital staff members came in, even the cooks out of
the kitchen. I woke up and said, `What are y'all doing up here?'
   ``He said, `Ms. Thornton, you are going down in history.'''
   It was not just the fact that Williams was there to do what had
to be done, his patients say. It was the way he did it.
   ``When I had my daughter, I had a very hard time,'' Gennell Dix
said. ``I stayed in labor, hard labor, for 26 hours. When it was
over, I woke up looking for Dr. Williams. You know how a little
child says, when Mommy or Daddy comes in, it makes it all better?
That's the way it was with him. He came in, full of joy, and a lot
of times, he embraced his patients.''
   Bullock County stopped offering obstetrical services with
Williams' death and stopped searching for a replacement on Sept.
15. The task proved impossible, said Don Priori, who heads the
hospital board.
   Every year, 12 percent of OB-GYNs stop delivering babies. Those
who continue rarely choose to work in small towns with big
problems. Twenty-nine of Alabama's 67 counties have no OB-GYN.
   The hospital looked for help to a federal program, the National
Health Service Corps, which gives scholarships to medical students
who agree to serve in needy areas. Under the Reagan administration,
however, the program's budget has gone from $100 million in 1978 to
$2 million this year, and the number of scholarships is down from
more than 3,000 to just 40.
   Bullock County, which couldn't afford to wait even two months,
was told to wait another year. The job of finding a replacement was
complicated by the fact that Williams literally did the work of two.
   ``He was on call virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week,''
said Duane Brookhart, Bullock County Hospital administrator. ``When
an obstetrician looks at the types of need that exist, they're
going to say, `I need some back-up. I need some days off.' I think
that made it twice as difficult.''
   In the week before his death, Williams delivered 10 babies,
including two by Caesarean section. The last was a 7-pound,
11-ounce boy named Aaron. His own son, now a third-year medical
student at his father's alma mater, spent the summer working with
him, including the last 24 hours.
   ``On Tuesday, he had a delivery, a D and C, and a C-section.
Then he did his rounds in surgery. We went to the office, and then
he stayed at the hospital until 9 p.m.,'' Bobby said.
   Williams drove home, and Bobby stayed overnight in the
hospital's on-call room. His father awakened him at 6 the next
morning to do rounds before the elder Williams performed a
hysterectomy.
   ``I was in surgery with him,'' Bobby said. ``He said, `I'm
dizzy.' He slumped forward. They started cardiac resuscitation.
   ``That was one of the worst feelings I have ever had in my
life,'' he said. ``I felt helpless.''
   Another doctor, Judy Jehle, was flown in by emergency helicopter
from a Montgomery hospital to complete the surgery. Jehle had
recently cut obstetrics out of her own practice because of the long
hours.
   At the funeral, more than 1,000 people crowded into the church.
Many more went to the funeral home, their children in tow.
   ``One lady picked up her baby and said, `This is Dr. Williams.
This is who delivered you,''' Dix said. ``She had a picture taken.
She didn't ever want to forget him.''

Peterson, the host of a horror movie series who's just made her
first movie, ``Elvira: Mistress of the Dark.''
   ``Elvira becomes like my real self, which I try to do. Sometimes
I become like Elvira. I throw Elvira-isms into what I do and say,
depending on my mood.''
   Most of those Elvira-isms are unprintable _ they go far beyond
``Beulah, peel me a grape.''
   ``People say I have a lot in common with Mae West,'' Peterson
said. ``I was a never a big fan of hers but I can certainly now see
the common thread. We're both kind of the bad gal with a heart of
gold character. Lots of double entendres.''
   They also share a similar anatomy: Peterson is well endowed.
   For the uninitiated, Elvira is the host of ``Movie Macabre,''
broadcast locally in Los Angeles. Her fame quickly grew, moving
beyond talk show appearances and commercials into a fan club and
marketing windfall, with Elvira records, greeting cards, T-shirts,
comic books and key chains. Peterson developed her alter ego seven
years ago.
   ``I thought the movie would be a great idea for this
character,'' Peterson said. ``The film companies didn't think I had
enough nationwide appeal but then I got spots on Johnny Carson and
Bob Hope.
   ``Once I became national, NBC saw the potential and signed me
up.''
   As for Peterson, she is quite unlike her alter ego. She has long
red hair and dressed very simply in jeans and a leotard shirt for a
recent interview. She is married to Mark Pierson, her manager.
   Elvira was born Cassandra Peterson in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
and had the good fortune to have a mother who owned a costume shop.
   ``I dressed up all the time. I would dress like Miss Kitty from
`Gunsmoke.' My aunt sent me this funny picture of me as a witch
when I was 5 years old. I've got on a black wig and a witch dress.
I look like a 5-year-old Elvira,'' she said.
   Her love for switching costumes and identities did not equip her
for the stage. In fact, she flunked her high school drama class.
   ``I was playing in `Our Town.' I kept telling jokes, making
funny faces. I got kicked out of the part. I was the class clown. I
was making a farce of it,'' she said.
   ``Our Town'' was never for Peterson; ``Viva Las Vagas'' is more
her style. In fact, in the 1960s when she was 17, she worked as a
Las Vegas showgirl.
   ``I try to keep it really campy,'' she said. ``The film company
thinks it a men's cult. It's straight camp. It's a very
self-depreciating character. It's all a kind of setup. Some people
don't get it and some do.
   ``It's like being a cartoon character. It's like a male Pee-wee
(Herman). A walking cartoon.''
   Her costume and alter ego allow her a certain amount of privacy,
she says.
   ``That is one of the great things. I'm the world's luckiest
celebrity. If I want to put on no makeup and put on curlers and go
walking down Hollywood Boulevard, nobody will know it's me,''
Peterson said.
   However, fame caught up to her last month when Maila ``Vampire''
Nurmi, a former horror hostess, filed a $10 million suit in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles, claiming she had developed the
Elvira character in the 1950s before Peterson.
   ``Horror hostesses are all wearing just about the same outfit,''
Peterson said. ``You've got pretty slim parameters. Mine were that
I had to be in black and had to have black hair and look sexy. Any
similarity is purely coincidental. If someone told you to look like
Dracula, what would you wear?''
   But Elvira isn't just a black dress and wig, it's a whole other
person.
   ``I always compare it to someone at a costume party. If you're
in a total disguise, you kind of go wild. Nobody knows who you are.
You might do things you otherwise wouldn't do. They suddenly become
these wild animals. When I put on this costume and wig, I become
this wild underside of my character.''

<HEAD>`SNL' Looks to Reclaim Stride After Strike-Called Season</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Al Franken was trailing the candidates with a
satellite dish on his head; Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon were
Austrian weightlifters Hans and Franz _ ``We want to pomp you op!''
Dan Aykroyd made a surprise appearance as Bob Dole.
   NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' had just hit stride last spring
when the Writers Guild strike brought everything to a halt.
   Executive producer Lorne Michaels hopes to get back on track
soon _ the show begins its 14th season Saturday _ but laments
missing seven shows that would have culminated in a nostalgic
season-ender with Gilda Radner and Bob Dylan.
   ``If there had been a strike in 1985, I wouldn't have minded it
so much,'' said Michaels in an interview in his NBC office. ``But
we were in such good rhythm. Our ratings were going up every week.
... I just thought we were doing very good work. It was an election
year, the writing was there, the cast was there.''
   Michaels launched the show in 1975, and with it the careers of
Radner, Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Jane Curtin and Bill
Murray. Michaels left in 1980 to produce movies, but returned in
1985. A rushed-together cast spent an unhappy season under
crushingly negative reviews.
   In 1986, the show rebounded with a new cast that has remained
intact for three seasons. This group seems to have shaken off the
ghosts of the now-fabled originals.
   Aykroyd played Dole off Nora Dunn's edge-of-hysteria takeoff on
Congresswoman Pat Schroeder. Dana Carvey did a brilliant Robin
Williams opposite Williams himself, as his own father. Phil
Hartman, who can do everybody from Jimmy Swaggart to Phil Donahue,
perfected Barbara Bush.
   Michaels said he had felt out of touch with the late-night
audience when he came back in 1985 and unwisely heeded advice to
target the show to some nebulous notion of a new and younger
audience.
   ``And so you start putting on stuff you don't think is funny or
that you're not comfortable with or a musical group that happens to
be hot at that moment, booking from the charts instead of from your
tastes,'' he said. ``And it's disorienting, because if you fail
that way, as I did, you go, well, where's the satisfaction? There's
no satisfaction. So after that season, I went back to, I'm going to
put on the things that I think are good and hopefully I'm not that
out of step.''
   Michaels, 43, now oversees a staff of writers who in some cases
were in junior high school when SNL premiered.
   ``You know, there's a certain point where you're sitting in a
room, and it's 2 o'clock in the morning, and you're saying, `I
don't think it will work,' words that as you hear them coming out
of your head, you realize these people, and sometimes those people
are 25 or 26, and they're looking at you, and you think, `They're
thinking, he's old and annoying.' And you know that you think it
won't work because you wrote it three times, you produced it eight
times, and it didn't work any of the 11 times. They're thinking,
`He just doesn't get it.'''
   Michaels produced the Emmy Awards show for Fox this summer,
livening up the proceedings and keeping the show mercifully short.
He says it's an experience he feels he needs only only once in his
life, though.
   Now, besides shepherding SNL, he is helping launch two new shows:
   _``Sunday Night,'' a variety show that premiered on NBC last
Sunday, will feature an eclectic assemblage of musical guests.
David Sanborn and Jools Holland are co-hosts. Comedian Kevin Meany
is a regular.
   _``Kids in the Hall,'' an HBO series featuring a young comedy
troupe from Michaels' home town of Toronto.
   ``There is a time in people's careers which is more interesting
for me to be working with them ... to watch people come into their
own and just blossom,'' Michaels said.
   Earlier in the day, at an NBC press conference about the new
season of ``Saturday Night Live,'' Michaels was asked what was new
to say after 14 years.
   ``Our show is one that will always be described as uneven, and I
think there's a point in the development of a cast when they sort
of hit stride. Our cast, before we were taken off the air (by the
strike) had hit stride.
   ``I think this season will be a great season,'' he said. ``And I
haven't said that the last three years.''

the first day back in the studio for Costas since the Seoul

<BYLINE>By CASSANDRA BURRELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOLLIDAYSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children around the world have played
with springy Slinkies for 43 years, but the 70-year-old woman who
helped invent the wire toy says it hasn't been all fun and games.
   Betty James, president of James Industries Inc., says her late
husband, Richard James, a mechanical engineer and naval architect,
came up with the idea of the toy in 1943 while aboard a ship. He
saw a torsion spring fall from a table and bounce.
   Mrs. James took control of the business in 1960, when her
husband lost interest and left the family to join what she called a
religious cult in Bolivia. He died there in 1974.
   ``To this day,'' she said, ``I don't know what a torsion spring
is.''
   James Industries is a spartan, no-nonsense firm that turns out
Slinkies by the millions in this small central Pennsylvania town.
It employs 120 people who manufacture, package, sell and ship
Slinkies from a single building.
   A grandmother of 10, Mrs. James says she's basically a doting
mother devoted to her six adult children and their families.
According to her oldest son, she's also a demanding and assertive
boss.
   ``She expects a lot out of you. She expects you to produce. And,
so you do produce,'' said Richard James II, 46. He is Slinky sales
manager and the only one of three sons and three daughters to join
the family business.
   Mrs. James, who is known as ``Big Betty,'' is not too big to
take telephone messages for her staff and do many other tasks.
``When we first moved into this building, I used to clean the
toilets, too,'' she said.
   She's been involved in every aspect of production and promotion.
   Slinky was put on the market in 1945, after the Jameses spent
two years experimenting with various types of steel.
   After receiving a patent, they demonstrated the toys at a
Gimbel's department store in Philadelphia. ``They gave us the end
of a counter so we could show how it walked,'' Mrs. James recalled.
   ``I was so scared that no one would buy them, I called a friend
and asked her to come along. I thought we would each buy one if
nobody else did,'' she said.
   She needn't have worried. After a quick demonstration, the first
400 Slinkies sold out in 90 minutes at a dollar each.
   ``I was so taken aback when I saw this crowd of people _ and
everyone was waving dollar bills.''
   Each night, Mrs. James took the day's production home from the
manufacturer and wrapped the Slinkies by hand with yellow paper.
   Richard James, meanwhile, came up with other inventions, but
none were successful.
   ``He was a dreamer,'' she said. ``He developed a refrigerator
that would dispense soft drinks, but we took it out because we were
drinking so many soft drinks we were getting fat. He also wanted to
work on an amphibious car.''
   When her husband left, Mrs. James struggled to keep the business
alive to feed herself and her children.
   ``To me, my family is the most precious thing in life. ... I
always wanted a family because I was an only child,'' she said.
``You do what you have to do for them. I did what I had to do.''
   The first Slinky plant was in Philadelphia's Germantown section.
Mrs. James moved to Hollidaysburg, 180 miles away, 23 years ago
because she had family and friends in the area who could help care
for her children.
   The family moved a year and a half before the company's move was
complete, and Mrs. James commuted to Philadelphia each week. She
drove to Philadelphia on Sunday evenings, returning home on
Thursdays.
   ``It was hard to see her crying because she had to leave the six
of us,'' her son Richard said.
   Today, James Industries sells millions of Slinkies around the
world. Mrs. James, who with her children owns all company stock,
declined to release the number of units sold annually or annual
sales figures. Slinkies usually retail for less than $2.
   The company produces other toys, including building blocks,
plastic rings, games and pin wheels. ``But Slinky outsells them
all,'' Mrs. James said.
   ``It's simple. It's a universal toy. It's a toy that doesn't
need any explanation. It has intrinsic play value,'' her son said.
``There are very few other toys like that.''
   James Industries began producing brightly colored plastic
Slinkies in 1979, to appeal to younger children, especially infants.
   Mrs. James and her son gasp at the thought of updating the
television commercial jingle that declares ``Slinky, Slinky ...
Everyone loves a Slinky.'' The song was written in 1963.
   ``We'll just stick to something that's good,'' she said.

<HEAD>Health Care Costs Are Soaring Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of health care is rising sharply again,
and among the reasons why, incredibly, is the success of past
cost-containment efforts.
   Yes, you read it correctly.
   This seemingly illogical, almost impossible state of affairs _
cost cutting leading to inflation _ illustrates the pernicious
financial nature of the health-care beast, which avoids the most
carefully laid anti-inflation traps.
   The origins of the latest price spurt go back to the early and
mid-1980s when, you might recall, health-care officials in every
area of the industry felt drastic measures were required.
   At that time, according to a consultant on corporate benefits,
the William M. Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen concern, many state Medicaid
programs, private-sector benefit plans and Medicare tackled costs
with a vengeance.
   Among other things, they implemented case-based hospital
reimbursement systems, set up hospital utilization review programs
and shifted costs from employers to employees. Dispensers and users
of services, therefore, would be put on the side of cost
containment. It would be in their financial interest.
   It worked. Hospital utilization and occupancy rates fell.
   While that might seem to be a positive result, it wasn't
entirely so. The reason: To hospitals, each dollar saved through
cost containment was a revenue dollar lost. To correct it, they had
to cut expenses _ or rebuild revenues.
   Cutting expenses can appear easier than it is. For example,
hospitals have many fixed costs for plant and equipment that do no
decline as occupancy rates fall. The situation can force
administrators to seek higher revenues.
   The most frustrating illustration of this, according to the
consulting firm's report, is in ambulatory surgery.
   In designing cost-containment strategies, many sponsors of
health insurance plans identified hospital surgical procedures that
could be performed safely in an outpatient surgical facility.
   These sponsors began to encourage workers to have certain types
of surgery performed on an outpatient basis, thus saving the cost
of a one-day or two-day hospital stay. Employees were offered
financial incentives to do so.
   Now, says Mercer-Meidinger-Hansen, these corporate sponsors are
finding that outpatient facility charges are as high as $3,000 for
as little as a few hours use.
   ``Ironically,'' it states, ``in many instances plan costs would
actually be reduced if these surgeries were again performed in the
hospital, since the cost of one day there can be less expensive
than the surgical facility charge.''
   This is just one illustration of the difficulties involved in
holding the line on health care costs. There are plenty of other
reasons, including the changing natures of health and illness
themselves.
   AIDS, for instance, was not a cost factor until relatively
recently. Now, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that total
expenses for one patient might be as high as $150,000 between
diagnosis and death.
   Other cost problems involve the increasing price of medical
education, an investment that must be recovered; the surging cost
of certain malpractice insurance, and the defensive medical tests
and procedures now being used.
   But much of the inflation problems lie within the nature of the
industry itself. Putting a dollar cost on life remains one of man's
most difficult challenges, one from which even the most hardnosed
executives retreat.
   Meanwhile, many companies and others who sponsor health
insurance plans are confronted with enormous increases in their
bills.
   While the economy in general worries about 4.5 percent
inflation, the consulting firm's report states that many plan
sponsors have seen their bills rise this year by 30 percent to 80
percent.

<HEAD>Two New Books Praise and Assail Indonesia's Co-Founder Sukarno</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The President Sukarno who died in
disgrace 18 years ago is again stirring controversy in the nation
he led to independence from the Dutch after World War II.
   Two recently published books spotlight the leader whose vivid
personality has an almost mythic hold on many Indonesians who refer
to themselves as Sukarnoists.
   In the memoirs of Col. Bambang Widjanarko, his military aide
from 1960 to 1968, Sukarno is portrayed as helplessly buffeted by
political forces beyond his control during an aborted communist
coup Sept. 30, 1965.
   Some critics complained that Bambang's ``Eight Years Near
Sukarno'' glosses over Sukarno's shortcomings, but it is the less
controversial of the two books.
   The other book, in the view of Sukarnoists, should be banned for
blackening the reputation of the nation's co-founder.
   It is titled ``He Who Sows The Wind Will Reap The Storm'' and
says Sukarno was involved in the aborted coup and was a committed
Marxist since his student days in the 1920s.
   Written by Sugiarso Surojo, a former intelligence officer who
now edits a women's magazine, ``He Who Sows'' describes Sukarno as
``a conspirator adept at concealing his true identity.''
   Charges of complicity in the uprising in which six top army
generals were slain are not new. Several military tribunals heard
testimony years ago that Sukarno knew the coup was planned but did
nothing to prevent it.
   Earlier foes also denounced what they saw as his demogoguery,
hedonistic lifestyle and tilt toward the Communist Party, which is
now banned.
   Sukarno remained as president in name only after signing over
power on March 11, 1966, to Maj. Gen. Suharto, who foiled the
revolt five months earlier. Sukarno and Suharto, who is now 66, are
the only presidents this country has known.
   Sugiarso said he was inspired to write his book partly by the
revival of Sukarnoism during last year's general election campaign.
   Thousands of young Indonesians in red T-shirts and headbands
thronged rallies in support of the Indonesian Democratic Party, a
grouping of five political parties, one of which was founded by
Sukarno 61 years ago. The party had been faring poorly and its
leaders calculated correctly that the Sukarno magnetism would help
revive its fortunes.
   With Megawati Sukarno, one of Sukarno's daughters, among the
successful candidates last year, the party increased its
representation in the 500-seat Parliament from 24 to 40 members and
its proportion of the total vote from 7.9 to 11 percent.
   With Sukarnoism making a comeback among youth, Sugiarso said,
his book is intended to balance what he called a lopsided view of
history fostered by the country's founding generation.
   ``The time has come for our national history to be straightened,
written objectively, so as to be a mirror for our future leaders
and for the young generation who have not known their true national
history,'' he said.
   Attorney General Sukarton Marmosudjono described the book as
unethical but rejected calls to ban it. Home Affairs Minister
Rudini also objected to the book and Lt. Gen. Harsudiono Hartas,
chief of the armed forces social and political section, urged a
stop to the Sukarno ``polemic.''
   No sales figures were available but booksellers said it was
moving briskly.
   Sukarno was officially forgotten and rarely mentioned favorably
in ruling circles after his death at the age of 69 from a kidney
ailment June 21, 1970.
   Once hailed for his vision of a unified nation free of Dutch
colonial rule, his economic policies had virtually bankrupted
Indonesia.
   Popular interest in Sukarno was reignited after the government
decided in 1979 to build an elaborate tomb for his remains,
replacing a simple grave that was covered by a faded yellow parasol.
   Newspapers were allowed for the first time in years to mention
his name. Portraits of Sukarno went on sale and a two-week exhibit
of memorabilia attracted throngs. Books he wrote books came off the
banned list.
   Statues of Sukarno and the country's first vice president and
co-founder, Mohammad Hatta, were dedicated in 1980 at the site
where they declared independence on Aug. 17, 1945. Hatta resigned
in 1956, partly as a result of disenchantment with Sukarno's
leadership, and died in 1980.
   Jakarta's efficient new airport was renamed the SukarnoHatta
International Airport three years ago.
   The son of a schoolteacher and a Balinese dancer, Sukarno became
one of the best known nationalists in what then was the Netherlands
East Indies after forming a political party in 1927. The Dutch
sentenced him to four years in prison in 1929.
   Freed in 1931, he was arrested again the following year and
spent the next eight years in exile in the outer islands. His exile
ended when the Japanese invaded during World War II and freed him.
Some Indonesians accused him of collaborating with the Japanese.
   Following their declaration of independence in 1945, Sukarno and
Hatta raised an army and and took to the jungle for a four-year
struggle against the Dutch.
   Although the Dutch captured and again exiled Sukarno in 1948,
his battle for independence stirred world opinion, and the United
Nations urged freedom for the nation. Sukarno was freed in 1949 and
later that year the Dutch relinquished power.

<HEAD>Jack London's Daughter Basks In His Legacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE CARPENTER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Becky London never answered the call
of the wild and rarely got the attention she craved from her famous
father.
   But despite a somewhat sheltered childhood and unremarkable
life, she remains a striking link to Jack London, a man whose tales
of struggles for survival made him one of America's most beloved
authors.
   If London were alive today, he'd enjoy spinning yarns with his
only surviving child. Becky, 85, has a few of her own, many about
the man she still lovingly refers to as ``Daddy.''
   ``Talking with Becky is like having a chat with her father,''
says Russ Kingman, a London expert and a friend of the writer's
daughter. ``Even her letters read like a Jack London story.''
   Bess ``Becky'' London Fleming has never been one to take
advantage of her father's fame, she says. But recently she's
immersed herself in her roots.
   She began using her maiden name after her husband died in 1982.
Most of her life has been spent in Oakland, the author's home city
for years. Six years ago she moved north into an apartment annex of
the Jack London Bookstore in the Valley of the Moon.
   Occasionally, she visits the nearby ranch, now a state
historical park, where the writer was living when he died in 1916.
She also has made public appearances and lectures, and cheerfully
obliges with anecdotes about him for visitors to her home,
decorated with pictures of cats, dogs and her father, along with
his books _ ``The Call of the Wild,'' ``The Sea Wolf,'' ``White
Fang.''
   It is a fitting devotion for a woman who says proudly that her
paternal connection is still the greatest thing that ever happened
to her.
   With her round face and engaging personality, Becky is ``almost
a clone of her father,'' according to Kingman, who runs the
bookstore in this idyllic Sonoma County community.
   ``She has the same love for other people, the same knack for
making other people feel that they're important, the same bubbly
personality.''
   Both Becky and her sister, Joan, were products of London's first
marriage, to Bess Maddern. They were divorced when Becky was a year
old, and her jealous mother never allowed her to visit her father
at the ranch with his second wife, Charmian.
   Kingman says Joan, who wrote a biography of London and worked
for the AFL-CIO for 30 years before dying in 1972, was the author's
favorite daughter. Becky, who adored him, only had one full day
with him by herself, when Joan was sick. Becky was only 14 when he
died.
   ``Otherwise, Becky was the caboose,'' says Kingman. ``He never
had time for her. It's a tragedy.''
   Though she wishes they could have spent more time together,
there is no trace of bitterness to her voice.
   ``He still is my model of what a father ought to be,'' Becky
London says. ``Of course, he was human, he had his faults.''
   Among her memories are numerous outings the writer had with his
two daughters.
   ``He used to take us to an amusement park in Oakland,'' she
recalls. ``We went to San Francisco with him when we were older,
taking the train, the ferry boat and the cable cars. Oh, how Daddy
loved cable cars!''
   Her father didn't talk a lot about himself with his daughters,
preferring to focus on their lives, she says. It wasn't until she
was about 10, when she was dusting a bookcase and pulled out book
after book he'd written, that she discovered he was famous.
   ``I still remember how dumbfounded I was,'' she says, shaking
her head.
   But the public was aware of his fame. ``It was thrilling to go
out with Daddy because everybody knew him and he was always so
gracious to them,'' she said.
   ``Daddy bought us taffy candy and we'd walk up Market Street and
everybody in the city, it seemed, would stop and talk to him.
Sailors, hobos, businessmen wearing silk hats, ladies in carriages,
boxers _ he knew them all. I was so proud. Sometimes he'd shake
hands and leave them a $5 gold piece.''
   He also took personal charge of the girls' education, sending
them a trunkful of books to read every year. Stories about heroes
were a frequent choice, along with history books.
   Today, Becky London has lost her treasured ability to read
because of deteriorating eyesight. She spends much of her time
chatting with friends, listening to baseball games on the radio _
she's a big fan of the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants _
and savoring positive memories.
   ``I was born an optimist,'' she says. ``I don't worry. I'm happy
all the time.''

   Hunched over slightly, Aaron Miller steadies his
.22-caliber pistol and fires, blowing pea-sized holes in a target's
black bull's eye. The 10-year-old is probably as good a shot as any
at a popular suburban shooting range.
   But there's another side of the story about children and
firearms, especially in Florida, where the Legislature recently
made it easier for residents to buy and carry sidearms.
   In Dade County alone, 37 youths 18 years old and under have been
fatally shot this year, 13 more than in all of 1987, according to
the Medical Examiner's Office.
   Just this summer, the body of a 14-year-old boy was hidden for
10 days by three young brothers in St. Petersburg who panicked when
a shotgun they were playing with accidentally discharged; a
14-year-old boy was accidentally shot to death by his older brother
in the farming town of Pahokee; an 11-year-old boy shot in the head
by a playmate remains hospitalized in Tampa.
   And an 11-year-old Miami boy was shot and killed during a
so-called game of ``courage.'' Three friends were charged with
manslaughter.
   Police blame the tragedies on improperly stored weapons, peer
pressure, television violence and irresponsible adults. They also
cite relaxed state gun laws that have increased the number of
firearms in some communities.
   ``We're too gun-happy,'' says veteran Metro-Dade homicide Lt.
Mike Gonzalez. ``There are so many guns lying around in people's
homes and cars that naturally kids are going to get into them.''
   Some children such as Aaron get gun safety instruction at home,
but those killed and wounded often have little or no knowledge of
firearms.
   As part of a national effort, the National Rifle Association has
proposed a program in Florida elementary schools focusing on gun
safety.
   Although state Education Commissioner Betty Castor has flatly
rejected the idea, some school districts, including Dade County,
are looking at some form of gun education.
   Schools could help counter the feeling among many youths that
guns are ``cool,'' said Steve Morris, an educator at a school where
a Miami youth was recently slain with a handgun.
   ``We need to give more information on handguns _ not how to use
them but the dangers involved,'' said Morris, assistant principal
of Glades Junior High School, where seventh grader Marcus Mayorga
had just started summer school when he was killed.
   ``Maybe they need to see a picture of someone with their head
blown up,'' he suggested, acknowledging that may be too graphic.
``We need to show them the final outcome ... the anguish caused to
parents and friends.''
   Marcus and some friends got together July 12, unsupervised at
the home of a girl who had found the gun earlier under a dresser,
and they devised a Russian Roulette-style game to test each other's
courage.
   The game involved distracting the ``victim'' while one of them
unloaded the gun, according to Metro-Dade Det. John Butchko.
   Tragically, when Marcus was playing the victim the gun remained
loaded. He was killed instantly.
   Three teens now face manslaughter charges and will be tried in
juvenile court, Butchko said.
   Deadly games of chance killed three other Miami youths _ ages
14, 16 and 18 _ this year in separate incidents, according to the
Medical Examiner's Office.
   ``It's amazing there haven't been more cases like that,'' said
detective Gonzalez.
   The problem is not unique to Florida, of course. Nationwide, 328
youths 19 years old and under were killed by firearms in 1985, the
latest year for which figures are available, according to the
Maryland-based National Center for Health Statistics.
   Gonzalez, Morris and Florida's NRA spokeswoman Marion Hammer
believe that television violence may have a role in encouraging
children to glamorize guns and not treat them seriously.
   ``I think TV to a great extent is responsible because a lot of
children know absolutely nothing about guns other than what they
see on TV, and those are the wrong things,'' said Ms. Hammer.
   The level of violence consumed by the average child appears to
have increased in recent years, with more movies available on
videocassette and cable television, said Dr. Thomas Redecki,
research director for the private National Coalition on Television
Violence. He estimated that the average child in the United States,
by age 18, will witness on TV 32,000 murders, 40,000 attempted
murders and 225,000 acts of violence.
   The NRA is pushing for an elementary-level gun safety program
that would focus on the concept of ``No. Go. Tell.'' That is, if a
youngster sees a gun, neither to pick it up nor to get near someone
handling it but to tell an adult about it.
   ``Regardless of where you stand philosophically on the issue,
the common ground upon which we must all stand is the safety and
protection of children,'' Ms. Hammer insists.
   David Voss, spokesman for the state education commissioner, said
his boss ``simply does not feel it is the school's responsibility
to teach about guns. She also is against any sort of state-mandated
program regardless of what you think about the issue; schools have
all they can handle now.''
   Voss didn't know of any districts considering firearms
education, and Ms. Hammer said she could not identify those which
she said had expressed an interest in the NRA proposal or something
similar.
   Dade County, however, has a committee studying the issue.
   ``I think we're treading on some dangerous ground ... We know
it's a critical issue but it's incumbent upon us to carefully
plan,'' said Gloria McPhee, executive director of general and basic
skills education for the county. She said the likely target of gun
safety information would be parents, who could in turn discuss the
issue with their children.
   Ten-year-old Aaron, who goes to the shooting range every few
weeks, isn't so sure that talking to kids in school about guns will
help stop them from getting hurt.
   He said his father, who accompanies him on the outings, has
taught him well about firearm safety, but ``not all people have as
good a father.''
   Reciting his No. 1 safety rule, he said, ``As far as I'm
concerned, every gun is loaded.''

<TEXT>
   Some people are betting that the devastating
drought of 1988 is over, that next year will see a return to
normalcy in U.S. crop production. After all, they say, that's been
the historical pattern.
   There were helpful rains the last couple of months, and the crop
growing season has virtually ended. So there is less news about the
drought, although in huge areas of the nation dryness still
prevails, the deep, subsoil kind that will require a foot or two of
precipitation to remedy.
   All in all, say Agriculture Department economists, most farmers
and ranchers have survived the crop and pasture losses better than
some thought possible at midyear when heat and drought were so
rampant.
   One important note of optimism came recently from the
department's Economic Research Service. Drought temporarily slowed
the recovery in farmland values, but appraisers think land prices
will climb at a healthy clip in 1989.
   ``Land prices primarily reflect long-term expectations for farm
income, interest rates and other factors,'' says agency economist
Roger Hexem. ``But short-term events such as the drought can reduce
farmers' liquidity, which in turn reduces the demand for farmland
or increases supply of land on the market if farms fail.''
   A survey of rural appraisers in August indicated that farmland
prices nationwide rose 1.2 percent from May 1 to the end of July,
slightly behind the 1.8 percent increase for the preceding three
months. Looking to this fall, the appraisers said they expected
land values to rise an average of only 0.9 percent from Aug. 1
through October.
   But they also indicated farmland values may rise 4.6 percent in
1989, faster than a 3.6 percent increase forecast last May prior to
the main drought impact.
   ``If the inflation rate continues to edge upward, farmland
values may improve,'' Hexem said. ``However, wariness about next
year's growing conditions, farm incomes and interest rates seem to
be dampening the near-term outlook, particularly in areas where the
drought has been most severe.''
   By reducing grain output, driving up commodity prices and
putting livestock producers in a bind for forage and emergency feed
supplies, the drought took a further toll of producers who had
suffered the financial crunch of earlier years.
   ``There likely won't be as many farms next year as there would
have been without the 1988 drought,'' says another agency
economist, Clark Edwards, in the October issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine.
   Drought, he said, created financial hardships that ``have
accelerated many of the forces that were already leading to fewer
but larger farms'' in the United States.
   This consolidation, or decline in farm numbers, occurred rapidly
_ averaging almost 3 percent a year _ after the peak in 1935 of
6.81 million farms. Then, in the early 1970s, exploding export
markets made farming financially attractive.
   According to the 1982 census of agriculture, Edwards said, the
number of farms in the preceding decade declined only 0.4 percent a
year.
   In the early 1980s, as lower commodity prices and rising
interest rates squeezed producers, profits from farmland dropped
and so did land values. Farm numbers declined again and
consolidations increased.
   ``Farmers hurt most by the drought are offering land for sale or
rent in sufficient numbers to slow the rise in land values that
began last year, following six years of decline,'' Edwards said.
``This lowers the price of land relative to its value, leading to
further consolidations by farmers with growth potential.''
   But the drought is causing consolidation differently according
to region. In winter wheat areas of the southern Great Plains,
yields were high this year, and with rising market prices ``the
consolidation would be somewhat like that experienced in boom
times, including a slowing in the rate of exit'' from farming, he
said.
   ``But for farmers growing spring wheat in the Northern Plains,
production was down by half, incomes were cut, and the
consolidation would be more like that experienced during bust
times,'' Edwards said.
   Urbanization, conversion to non-farm uses, rising transportation
costs, and expenses associated with new technologies are some other
factors that affect farmland consolidation.
   Edwards said a number of factors are working against the
tendency to farm consolidation, including:
   _Selling off parcels of land for city growth can result in a
larger number of small farms.
   _Non-farm incomes help ensure survival of smaller farm
operations, including part-time and hobby farms.
   _Some farms that produce specialty commodities appear small by
some measures but are proving profitable and durable.
   _Larger farms sometimes reach a size beyond which they can grow
no more and may even break up into smaller farms. Census
information shows that large farms ``are just as likely to break
into small ones as small farms are to blossom into large ones.''

reject a $2.51 billion tender offer from British publisher Robert
Maxwell, setting the stage for a court showdown over the conduct of
the bidding for the publishing giant.
   Macmillan previously agreed to a slightly lower, $2.5 billion
buyout proposal from a group led by the investment firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. and Macmillan senior management.
   The company's rejection Wednesday of Maxwell's latest offer came
as no surprise.

   The chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board says his agency can no longer cover the cost of rescuing
ailing savings institutions without placing ``an exceedingly heavy
burden'' on the industry.
   M. Danny Wall, whose agency regulates the nation's 3,000 S&Ls,
told the Senate Budget Committee Wednesday it will cost $45 billion
to $50 billion to clean up the industry, boosting an earlier
projection by more than one-third.
   In July, Wall said it would cost $31 billion, an increase in
turn from a previous estimate of $22 billion.

   More than two-thirds of Americans surveyed want
to see the rich pay more taxes, while an increasing number of
people are growing disenchanted with the new tax law, according to
a new poll.
   The sixth annual Money magazine survey on Americans and their
money, released Wednesday, also found that many respondents expect
the economy to run into problems in the coming months. But those
surveyed don't expect to see their own financial situations worsen.
   The survey, conducted last spring, was the first taken after
taxpayers had their initial encounter with filing returns under the
new tax law.

   Some food prices have climbed above levels
explainable by the summer drought but no widespread price gouging
of grocery shoppers has been found thus far, congressional
investigators say.
   ``Some price increases do appear higher than warranted by the
drought alone,'' Senate Agriculture Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,
D-Vt., said Wednesday after receiving the report from the General
Accounting Office.
   Retail pasta prices increased 10.4 percent, cereal 7.1 percent
and white bread 8.2 percent from January through June, GAO
officials told the Agriculture Committee.

   Du Pont Co. is asking 20,000 employees
in its fibers department to share the company's profits and risks
starting in January as part of a three-year experiment that
executives say could become a model for the rest of the company.
   The new plan would tie a portion of employees' pay raises to the

   The plan, called ``achievement sharing,'' gives employees a

furloughed flight attendants, which follows the recent layoffs of
more than 3,000 employees to streamline the money-losing carrier's
operations.
   The furloughed flight attendants are being recalled effective
Oct. 21 because of the popularity of a long-term leave of absence
program, Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Wednesday.
   The program was offered as ``a way of minimizing the impact of
furloughs,'' and more volunteers were attracted than had been

<HEAD>Oil Prices Tumble, Stocks Post Small Gain</HEAD>

   Oil prices have slipped further to new two year lows, and
takeover speculation has helped the stock market post a modest gain.
   Congressional investigators, meanwhile, report finding no
widespread price gouging at grocery stores in the wake of the
summer drought.
   In the oil futures market, reports of growing supplies and
speculation about friction among key producers were cited for
sending crude oil prices below $13 a barrel Wednesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate dropped 47 cents to settle at $12.60 a
barrel. The benchmark U.S. crude traded as low as a $12.28 barrel
during a hectic session.
   Over the past month, the near-term crude oil contract price has
fallen $2.19 a barrel to the lowest level since August 1986.
   Prices for refined products traded on the exchange, such as
wholesale unleaded gasoline and home heating oil, also fell.
   Among the rumors sparking fears in the market was talk that
Nigeria had decided to leave the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, and that OPEC Secretary General
Subroto, considered a stabilizing force, would step down. Both
rumors were denied, analysts said.
   Also contributing to the decline was an American Petroleum
Institute report, released after the close of trading Tuesday, that
showed a higher-than-expected increase in crude oil stocks and a
sharp increase in refinery production.
   Stock prices were supported by takeover speculation, analysts
said. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.45 points to
2,106.51 on Wednesday, while advancing issues outnumbered declines
by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks.
   In Washington, D.C., a report from the General Accounting Office
said pasta, cereal and white bread prices rose more between June
and August than they did in the same period last year.
   But Senate Agriculture Committeee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,
D-Vt., said, ``in general, there do not seem to have been excessive
price increases across a broad range of products that use the
drought as an excuse.''

<TEXT>
   One of corporate America's longest and most
bitterly contested takeover battles is nearing an end, with Irving
Bank Corp.'s top management accepting a sweetened $1.4 billion
offer from rival Bank of New York Co.
   The announcement Wednesday came one day after Irving lost a key
court battle on its anti-takeover ``poison pill'' defense.
   Irving Chairman Joseph A. Rice said he would recommend the board
of directors approve the merger and drop all pending lawsuits and
anti-takeover defenses used to ward off Bank of New York's
year-long advances.
   He also promised to move up his retirement plans and leave after
the deal was completed.
   A special board meeting was set for Friday, although many
banking experts have called the vote a formality.
   ``We're 99 percent there. I believe the board will go along with
Rice,'' said Virginia Adair, a banking analyst with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Under the revised bid, Bank of New York would pay $15 in cash
and 1.675 shares of its own stock for each of Irving's 18.9 million
common shares outstanding. It also included warrants valued at $5 a
share toward the purchase of Bank of New York stock.
   The entire deal would be worth about $76 a share, or around $1.4
billion, about $200 million higher than the hostile offer. The
previous bid had the same amount of cash but slightly less stock
and did not include the warrants.
   Irving shares jumped $3.75 to close at $73.50 on the New York
Stock Exchange, while Bank of New York fell 75 cents to $34.12{.
   Neither side would comment on the turn of events leading to the
tentative pact. But banking analysts agreed Irving was forced to
negotiate with its unwanted suitor after losing Tuesday's court
rulings and in the absence of any friendly ``white knight''
takeover partner.
   The appellate division of the New York State Supreme Court on
Tuesday struck down a key provision of Irving's ``poison pill''
anti-takeover defense.
   The defense would have allowed all Irving shareholders except a
hostile suitor to buy $400 worth of Irving shares for $200 if any
suitor bought more than 20 percent of Irving stock without the
support of Irving's management. The plan was intended to make a
hostile takeover bids prohibitively expensive.
   Irving had vowed to appeal the ruling to the state's Court of
Appeals, but some legal experts questioned whether that court would
have considered the case since the appellate division's decision
was unanimous.
   ``The court ruling closed down one of their last possible escape
routes,'' said Mark Lynch, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co.
``They had very few options left.''
   Last spring, Milan-based Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, offered
to merge with Irving as part of a major restructuring of the New
York bank. But it recently withdrew its bid after the Federal
Reserve Board ruled the Italian government agency that owned most
of Banca Commerciale had to supply separate financial imformation.
   The Fed already has given conditional approval for an
Irving-Bank of New York merger.
   A merger would nearly double Bank of New York's size, vaulting
it close to the top 10 of the nation's largest banking companies.
The two had a combined $47.8 billion in assets as of June 30.
   Bank of New York, which owns 4.9 percent of Irving, had
maintained since unveiling its takeover proposal on Sept. 25, 1987,
that a merger would be a good fit because both banks have similar
markets and services. While many analysts agreed, they also
speculated Bank of New York might have feared it would become a
takeover target if a big West Coast or foreign bank decided to
enter the New York market.
   Drexel's Ms. Adair said she expected Bank of New York to proceed
with the strategy it proposed at the start. That includes selling
some of Irving's assets, reducing Irving's Third World debt
portfolio and consolidating facilities.
   Michael Starr, an analyst with Duff & Phelps, said, ``One thing
the Bank of New York is going to have to do is reaffirm client
relationships.
   ``They paid dearly for it (a merger) in both cost and disruption
both companies have incurred,'' Starr said.
   According to the merger proposal, all present directors of
Irving would be invited to join Bank of New York's board of
directors, and all key personnel decisions would be made by a
committee of directors made up of three directors of the Bank of
New York and two current Irving directors.
   If Irving's board backs Rice, Irving also would drop its poison
pill and waive a New York state anti-takeover law that prevents an
unfriendly merger for at least five years.
   When the bid was first made, it had the distinction of being the
first hostile takeover fight between major American banks. It then
became the lengthiest such battle among major U.S. corporations.

   The marathon fight for Macmillan Inc. appears
headed toward a showdown next week in court.
   The publishing giant's board, as expected, urged shareholders
Wednesday to reject a $2.51 billion tender offer from British
publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Macmillan previously agreed to a $2.5 billion buyout proposal
from a group led by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. and including Macmillan senior management.
   Macmillan stock rose 25 cents a share to $88.62{ in consolidated
New York Stock Exchange trading. That was slightly below Kohlberg's
latest offer of $90.05 in cash and securities for each of
Macmillan's 27.8 million shares. Maxwell's latest offer is $90.25 a
share in cash.
   ``I don't think the rejection makes much difference,'' said J.
Kendrick Noble, a media analyst for the investment firm PaineWebber
Inc. ``A recommendation from the board can't stop an alternative
bid.''
   Noble said ``the key issue now is in the courts.''
   Maxwell's tender offer is set to expire Oct. 13, while
Kohlberg's offer expires 24 hours later.
   Maxwell already had filed suit in Chancery Court in Delaware,
charging that the bidding process was unfairly skewed in favor of
the management bid. A hearing on the complaint was scheduled for
Monday.
   Macmillan said its board decided to recommend that shareholders
reject Maxwell's offer because it contained several conditions,
including invalidation of the ``legal and binding contractual
obligation'' with the Kohlberg group.
   Early last week, Macmillan gave both Maxwell and Kohlberg a
chance to make final offers for the company. At the time, Maxwell
was offering $86.80 a share in cash, while Kohlberg had offered $85
a share in cash and securities.
   Maxwell boosted his offer to $89 a share in cash.
   But Macmillan agreed to a subsequent Kohlberg offer of $90.05 a
share in cash and securities, and promised to sell the group four
of Macmillan's businesses for $865 million should its merger not be
concluded. They are the Berlitz language centers, the directory
division, the direct marketing division and a division that
publishes state legal codes.
   Maxwell subsequently boosted his offer to $90.25 a share in
cash, subject to, among other things, elimination of the agreement
to sell the four businesses.
   As an alternative, Maxwell said he would pay $900 million for
the four businesses that Macmillan agreed to sell to Kohlberg and
to drop his tender offer.
   Maxwell said in court papers filed Wednesday that Macmillan
Chairman Edward P. Evans had told Kohlberg what Maxwell's final bid
had been, enabling Kohlberg to top Maxwell's bid and demand the
``lockup option'' on the four businesses.
   Maxwell also said the sale of the four businesses had been
structured in a way to discourage any bids for the remainder of the
company by exposing Macmillan to a $250 million tax liability on
the sale.
   A spokesman for Macmillan said the communication from Evans to
the Kohlberg group was appropriate. Spokesman David Jackson said
Maxwell's advisers could have asked, in setting the ground rules
for the auction, that their final bid be kept secret, but failed to
do so.
   Macmillan has been embroiled in a takeover fight since mid-May
when a group led by the Texas financier Robert M. Bass proposed a
buyout at $64 a share. Bass has since dropped out of the bidding.

<TEXT>
   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC and Newmont Mining
Corp. are raising national security issues in an attempt to get
President Reagan to block a $4.9 billion hostile takeover by a
South African conglomerate.
   Gold Fields and Newmont, the objects of an overture by Minorco
SA, said in a filing Wednesday that an acquisition by the South
African interest would ``imperil U.S. access to strategic and
precious metals vital to national security.''
   Gold Fields, which is based in London, owns 49.3 percent of
Newmont, the New York-based company that is the largest gold
producer in the United States.
   Minorco SA last month offered $4.9 billion for the 71 percent
stake it does not already own in Gold Fields. Minorco, based in
Luxembourg, is controlled by South Africa's Anglo American Corp.
and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said he could not comment on
the filing because White House officials had not yet seen it.
   The Defense Production Act, as amended by this year's trade
bill, authorizes the president to suspend or prohibit any merger or
acquisition by a foreign company that threatens to impair national
security.
   Gold Fields and Newmont asked Reagan to immediately block the
transfer of U.S. assets pending completion of an investigation.
   Gold Fields controls 8 percent of the world's gold production.
It also produces rutile and zircon, which are raw materials for
metals used in military aircraft and submarines.
   The proposed acquisition by Minorco would be the largest
purchase to date of U.S. assets by South African interests. Half of
Gold Fields' assets are in the United States.
   The offer for Gold Fields has sparked a controversy even though
Anglo American and De Beers said they would relinquish control of
Minorco, and Minorco said it plans to sell Gold Fields' South
African interests.
   Officials at Minorco in Luxembourg were not available for
comment when the filing was announced late Wednesday in New York.

<HEAD>Du Pont Ties Employee Pay To Department Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees in the Du Pont Co.'s fibers
business soon will have a stake in the department's earnings, under
an experimental program linking part of their pay raises to their
department's financial performance.
   The ``achievement sharing'' that takes effect Jan. 1 for about
14,000 workers is expected to give employees incentive to see that
earnings continue to increase, Robert P. McNutt, who led the team
that developed the plan, said Wednesday.
   There will be at least a three-year trial for the plan and it
then could become a model for the entire company.
   McNutt said the fibers department, which makes nylon among other
fibers, has had ``fairly flat performance.''
   ``We need to continue to grow our earnings and it's key we keep
our people involved and we're doing that by giving them a stake in
it. We're making them value the business,'' McNutt said.
   The plan is unique because it does not freeze wages or ask for
employee ``give-backs,'' as do some similar plans in the auto
industry, according to McNutt.
   Chemical industry analysts say the plan is trend-setting,
although Du Pont is not the first company to try the concept.
   Harvey S. Stober, a chemical analyst for Dean Witter in New
York, said the plan was ``long overdue'' and could make employees
feel they own part of the company.
   ``The work could improve. Not to say it's suffered in the past.
But to tie (pay) certainly peaks interest,'' Stober said. He also
said such plans can lead to employees becoming more efficient and
finding cost-saving ways to do their jobs.
   ``Fibers is doing good, but it should be doing better and this
is a way to improve it,'' said William Young, a managing director
for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   For the first six months of 1988, sales in fibers were $2.8
billion, compared to $2.6 billion for the first six months of 1987.
After tax operating income was $322 million for the first six
months of this year and for the same period in 1987.
   Under the plan, Du Pont will begin placing an increasing portion
of each workers annual pay raise ``at risk,'' until 6 percent of
each employee's salary is at risk. That could take from three to
five years.
   During the phase-in period, each employee will always receive at
least 1 percent of any raise, regardless of the fibers business
performance.
   Annual pay will be based on a target rate equalling what Du Pont
would pay employees not covered by the experimental plan, and
raises and promotions would be based on the target rate. The
company will adjust actual pay each year based on the fibers
business financial results.
   If the department achieves 150 percent of its profit goal,
employees would get back the 6 percent of their pay that's at risk,
plus a bonus of up to 12 percent of their salary, depending on the
excess earnings, McNutt said.
   If the department achieves 80 percent of its profit goal, the
payout would be 3 percent of the money at risk. If the department
earns less than 80 percent of its profit goal, there would be no
payout, meaning the employees would not get the 6 percent of their
raises that had been placed at risk.
   The department has about 20,000 employees worldwide, most of
whom will fall under the plan Jan. 1. The company must negotiate
with about 6,000 union workers at plants in Delaware, Tennessee and
Virginia before those workers will partipate.
   Donald M. Hitchens, president of the Seaford Nylon Employees
Council, a union representing about 1,670 employees, said the union
probably would vote on the plan by the end of the month.
   But he said he did not know what impact the union's current wage
dispute with the company would have on acceptance of the plan.
Since March, the union twice has rejected the company's offer of a
1.9 percent raise and a $400 lump sum payment.

<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A. is pinning
hopes for a turnaround in a three-year sales slump on new vehicles
to debut in each of the 1989 and 1990 model years.
   Nissan introduced its 1989 model line on Wednesday with General
Manager Robert Thomas saying the Japanese automaker is looking
toward a restyled Maxima sedan and new 240SX to begin pulling the
company out of the sales doldrums.
   In the spring, Nissan plans to introduce a new version of the
300ZX and a small minivan, called the Axxess, he said.
   ``Our immediate success is riding on these new models,'' Thomas
said.
   Nissan's sales in the United States fell to 660,652 cars and
light trucks in the just-ended 1988 model year from 781,280
vehicles in the 1986 model year _ a 15.4 percent decline.
   ``Sales have not reached expectations for us or for others in
the industry,'' Thomas said. ``We can look to a lot of reasons for
a flat performance, like currency, intensifying competition or even
vacillating buyer moods.
   ``I'm optimistic about the future,'' he said. ``Right now, our
market share hovers around 4 percent. I think we can build that
share to more than 5 percent by the early 1990s, largely on the
strength of the four new models we'll be bringing out in the next
year.''
   But the sales turnaround won't take place immediately if
projections Thomas cited Wednesday are accurate. He said he expects
Nissan to sell about 660,000 vehicles in the 1989 model year, which
would continue the erosion of sales.
   Thomas said the low projections for 1989 stemmed from, among
other things, limited availability of 240SX models, the arrival
later this month of Maximas to dealer showrooms and the yen-dollar
exchange rate.
   ``We also recognize we've got to build up our image,'' he said.
   Thomas also said Wednesday:
   _Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tenn., has the capacity for another
assembly line, but that no decision has been made about whether to
expand the plant or, if so, what vehicle would be produced there.
   _The joint venture between Nissan and Ford Motor Co. in Avon
Lake, Ohio, would produce a larger minivan than the Axxess. The
Nissan-Ford project is to begin production in 1991 for the 1992
model year.
   _The Axxess will have dual rear sliding doors, instead of the
conventional right side sliding door on other minivans. ``The
advantage (of the Axxess) is our product will have power,
performance and handling,'' Thomas said.

<HEAD>Japan Provides $7.45 Billion In Development Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan provided a record $7.45 billion in
development assistance in 1987, up 32.3 percent from a year
earlier, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
   The ministry said in an annual report that Japan was the second
largest foreign aid donor in 1987 after the United States, which
extended $8.77 billion in assistance.
   But Japan's aid ranked 12th as an aid doner when the amount of
aid was compared to the nation's gross national product, the report
said. It said that ratio was 0.31 percent, up 0.01 percentage
points from 1986. Norway was first, having given 1.1 percent of its
gross national product in aid.
   Meanwhile, the government's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
said it had extended $3.9 billion in loans to developing nations in
fiscal 1987, up 8 percent from a year earlier. That fiscal year
ended March 31, 1988.
   An OECF official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
credits included: $757 million to Indonesia; $505 million to China;
$435 million to India; $284 million to the Philippines; $272
million to Thailand; and $213 million to South Korea.

<TEXT>
   Taiwan's trade surplus totaled $1.04
billion in September, down 27 percent from the previous month and
down 54 percent from the same month a year ago, the government
reported Thursday.
   The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
said exports in September totaled $4.47 billion, down 22 percent
from the previous month, while imports were $3.43 billion, a 20
percent decrease from August.
   The agency said Taiwan registered a total surplus of $7.82
billion for the first nine months of this year, down 48 percent
from the same period last year. Against the United States, Taiwan's
biggest trading partner, the surplus totaled $992.6 million in
September, down 22 percent from August.
   Trade officials attributed the decline of imports and exports
partly to the four-day Mid-Autumn Festival holiday in September.

   The stock market declined slightly today in
another sluggish session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.96 to 2,104.55
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 381 up, 510 down and
472 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.01 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Stocks have been drifting all week while traders await the Labor
Department report Friday morning on the employment situation for
September.
   Brokers say traders have been especially cautious because of
expectations that the figures will show job growth at a rate faster
than the Federal Reserve would like to see in its efforts to keep
inflation from reviving.
   A good many analysts doubt that the employment figures, however
they turn out, will end the market's recent period of lethargy.
   They note that Wall Street will still have to contend with
memories of last October's crash, whose approaching first
anniversary is getting a lot of publicity, and uncertainties about
the election in November.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Alcoa rose \ to 54~; American
Telephone & Telegraph was unchanged at 26], and Sears Roebuck

   Pro-government newspapers Thursday denounced
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government for its
``short-sighted decision'' to slash Kuwait's holdings in the
British Petroleum Co. and warned it will damage relations.
   The newspapers urged Kuwait's government to take retaliatory
measures against Britain's request Tuesday that the Kuwait
Investment Office reduce its holding in BP from 21.68 percent to
9.9 percent over the next year.
   The Kuwait Investment Office, the oil-rich gulf state's
London-based investment arm, has bought up 1.316 billion BP shares
since the British government sold off its one-third stake in the
oil giant last year.
   Kuwait stands to lose nearly $680 million at current market
prices if it cuts its BP holdings to the level the British are
seeking.
   The radical Al-Rai Al-Aam daily newspaper said in an editorial:
``The British decision will inevitably endanger political as well
as trade relations between the two countries.
   ``Despite attempts by the British government to justify its
uncordial and unjust decision, the British step will endanger
British-Kuwaiti relations.''
   The English-language Kuwait Times called the British decision
``a short-sighted step.''
   The newspaper said: ``It scarcely behoves a country like Britain
and a government like Mrs. Thatcher's to make such titanic
intervention as the demand made of Kuwait.
   ``The plain truth is that Kuwait's purchase of the BP shares
was, in effect, a rescue operation by a sincere friend of Britain.''
   The $12 billion BP share sale was a flop with investors because
it coincided with the financial market crash last October. Kuwait
subsequently stepped in as a buyer.
   Kuwait bought 10 percent of BP shares last November and
gradually increased that to 21.68 percent.

   Speculation over burgeoning world oil supplies
and unsubstantiated rumors about further rifts within OPEC have
helped push oil futures below the $13-a-barrel level.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate plunged 47 cents to settle at $12.60 a
barrel Wednesday in heavy, hectic trading. Still, the benchmark
U.S. crude recovered from its intra-day low of $12.28 barrel.
   In early trading today, it was up another 22 cents at $12.82 a
barrel.
   Crude futures prices have not been this low since August 1986. A
month ago, the near-term WTI contract had settled at $14.79.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the November
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 1.67 cents to settle
at 39.44 cents a gallon, while home heating oil slipped 0.41 cent
to 37.76 cents a gallon.
   Much of the day's selling was technical in nature, analysts said.
   Oil prices fell sharply on early rumors that Nigeria had decided
to leave the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and that OPEC General Secretary Subroto, known as a
crafter of compromises, would step down.
   Prices recovered somewhat when the rumors were denied.
   Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investment at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said ``this market has become so
rumor-sensitive that even if a story doesn't sound credible, there
is a violent reaction.''
   Barakat said at least some of the rumors were being instigated
by floor traders seeking to benefit their own positions. He also
said Saudi Arabia was giving the market a dose of its own
``intensive shock therapy.''
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, has voiced threats
that it will continue overproducing unless other OPEC members abide
by their production quotas.
   ``We're in a price war,'' said Peter Beutel, an assistant
director at Elders Futures Inc. Unless the Saudis change their
policy, the only way oil prices will rise is through technical
factors.
   ``There's no hope on the fundamental front,'' he said.
   Even before trading began, the market was poised for a selloff
with the latest statistics from the American Petroleum Institute.
The report, which was released after the close of trading Tuesday,
showed a higher-than-expected increase in crude oil stocks.
   The report also showed a sharp increase in refinery runs. ``It
just scares people to see the refineries looking like they are
going to increase the supply of refined products,'' Beutel said.

   The government said Thursday it will sell
state-owned British Steel Co. to the public in late November at a
price to be disclosed later.
   It will be the first privatization since the selloff of the
government's one-third stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC, which
coincided with the stock market crash last fall. Analysts said they
expect the sale to raise $3 billion. That $12 billion BP share sale
was a flop with investors, and left underwriters holding large
chunks of the stock.
   Kuwait subsequently stepped in as a buyer, accumulating a 22
percent stake in the oil giant which the government this week
ordered more than halved, saying such a large holding would
conflict with the public interest.
   The government said it will hold a special share in British
Steel for five years after the sale to prevent any single holding
exceeding 15 percent.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has sold off
billions of dollars of state-owned assets to the public to promote
capitalism and wider share ownership. Past sales have included
British Airways PLC, British Gas PLC, and luxury automaker Jaguar
PLC.
   The initial British Steel prospectus and sale date will be
announced Oct. 28, Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said.
   It will be the largest ever sale of shares in an industrial
manufacturing company in Britain. Up to 10 percent of the shares
will be reserved for employees.
   British Steel, after years of steep losses under state control,
is now one of the world's most profitable integrated steelmakers.
It is Europe's second largest steel producer and the fourth biggest
in the non-communist world.
   British Steel had pre-tax profit of $708 million in its fiscal
1987-1988 year. The company has shed 80,000 jobs since 1980,
leaving it with 53,000 employees.

<HEAD>Coniston Offers To Acquire TW Services</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners offered today to acquire TW
Services Inc. in a deal that values the food services concern at
$1.36 billion.
   The proposal, which would pay $28 for each of the 39.27 million
TW shares Coniston does not already own, had been expected. The
aggressive New York investment firm acknowledged two weeks ago that
it had amassed a 19 percent stake in TW and might seek to acquire
the company.
   In a letter delivered to the TW board today, Coniston said that
while it considered the offering price to be ``full and fair,'' it
was ``willing to consider offering more if (TW) can demonstrate
sufficient business prospects to justify doing so.''
   The Coniston principals have said that they consider TW, which
operates the Denny's and Hardee's fast-food chains, to be a prime
candidate for a leveraged buyout. In such a buyout, the purchaser
relies on borrowed money, secured by a target company's assets, to
finance an acquisition. The loans are repaid out of cash flow and
divestitures.
   After an initial delay in trading, TW opened at $26.50 a share,
up $1.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Coniston paid an average $19 a share for the 9.28 million TW
shares it purchased over a period of days in September. At the
current offering price, the acquisition would cost the firm an
additional $1.13 billion.
   Coniston principal Paul Tierney Jr. said in a telephone
interview that he and his partners met with TW Chairman Frank
Salizzoni and other executives recently.
   While that meeting was ``quite cordial and reasonable,'' Tierney
said, the conclusion of the TW board ``was that it did not wish to
sell the company at that time to Coniston.''
   Tierney said he hoped that the much more specific terms _ such
as price and financing _ spelled out in today's letter would give
the TW board reason to reconsider.
   If the board again rejected the overture, Tierney said, the
partnership might proceed with a hostile tender offer directly to
shareholders. Coniston requested a response by Wednesday.
   Formed in late 1986 as a result of the liquidation of Trans
World Corp., TW Services reported profits of $47.2 million on
revenue of $2.5 billion last year. The company's $850 million
acquisition of the Denny's chain in late 1987 is expected to boost
revenues to the $3.5 billion mark this year.
   Denny's operates about 1,250 restaurants nationwide. TW also
owns the Chicago-based Canteen Corp., which contracts food, vending
and recreational services throughout the nation at places like
stadiums and national parks.
   The company also owns Spartan Food Systems Inc. of Spartanburg,
S.C. The unit operates more than 400 Hardee's restaurants and 200
Quincy Family Steak houses, mostly in the southeastern part of the
country.
   Coniston Partners, with a warchest estimated at about $700
million, typically takes large positions in companies and uses that
clout to force management to sell the company or make changes that
boost the stock price.

   Grain and soybean futures prices declined today
in early trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by
bearish crop estimates from an influential private analyst.
   Sparks Commodities' figures put the U.S. soybean crop at 1.543
billion bushels, about 70 million more than the U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates last month, said Victor Lespinasse, a grains
trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The corn crop estimate of 4.474 billion bushels, about 12
million more than USDA's estimate, also was considered bearish and
sparked a flurry of selling in the corn pit, Lespinasse said.
   The six-to-10 day forecast calling for dry weather and ideal
harvesting conditions in major growing regions, as well as
follow-through selling from Wednesday's weak close added additional
pressure to the market, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2} cents to 3{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.23 a bushel; corn was 1}
cents to 2 cents lower with December at $2.91} a bushel; oats were
} cents to 1} cents lower with with December at $2.45 a bushel; and
soybeans were 11 cents to 12 cents lower, with November at $8.11 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures prices were mixed, hogs were mostly lower and
frozen pork bellies were down in early trading at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle opened .02 cent lower to .12 cent higher, with
December at 72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to
.18 cent higher, with October at 81.80 cents a pound; hogs were .27

and pork bellies were .02 cent to .28 cent lower, with February at

<HEAD>Burlington Northern To Transfer Headquarters to Fort Worth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burlington Northern Inc. says the
holding company will transfer its headquarters from Seattle, Wash.,
to Fort Worth by the end of this year, bringing about 20 new
executive-level jobs here.
   Gerald Grinstein, Burlington vice chairman, revealed the plans
Wednesday at the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce's annual Economic
Outlook Conference.
   Burlington Northern already employs about 750 people in Fort
Worth in the executive offices of Burlington Northern Railroad and
Meridian Oil Co., subsidiaries of Burlington Northern Inc. Meridian
includes the former Southland Royalty Co., which Burlington
Northern bought in 1985.
   In June, Burlington Northern announced that it would spin off
its energy and natural resources companies to Burlington Northern
shareholders. The new company will be called Burlington Resources
Inc., and its headquarters will remain in Seattle.
   Burlington Northern Inc. will be left primarily with its
railroad subsidiary, which operates a 23,500-mile railroad system
in 19 western states and two Canadian provinces.
   The chairman of Burlington Northern Inc., Richard Bressler, is
expected to become the chairman of Burlington Northern Resources as
well and also is likely to remain in Seattle. Bressler has been
chief executive officer of Burlington Northern since 1980. He moved
holding company offices from St. Paul, Minn., to Seattle in 1981.
   Grinstein, through a Burlington Northern spokesman, said the
company ``would have further details later this month.''
   Burlington Northern Inc. officials said it is unclear which
holding company functions would be transferred to Fort Worth. The
Seattle operation has about 60 workers and includes the chief
executive's office.
   The railroad relocated its executive headquarters to Fort Worth
in mid-1984 from St. Paul. Grinstein, as vice chairman of the
holding company, is the ranking executive in Fort Worth. Darius
Gaskins is president of the railroad.

<HEAD>Spain EEC Presidency Expected To Be Strong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European Commission President Jacques
Delors of France met Thursday with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez to discuss Spain's upcoming presidency of the European
Economic Community, Spanish officials said.
   Gonzalez met for an hour with Delors, head of the EEC's
executive branch, and Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez
Ordonez at the prime minister's official Moncloa palace residence,
the officials said.
   Gonzalez then hosted a luncheon for Delors, whose 24-hour visit
was the first of a scheduled tour of the capitals of Portugal,
Greece and Italy.
   Earlier Thursday, Delors spoke with King Juan Carlos for an hour
on European issues, said a palace spokesman, not identified in
keeping with custom.
   Spain is expected to exercise a strong presidency when it takes
over the six-month rotating office next Jan. 1 for the first time
since joining the 12-member trade bloc in 1986, European Commission
member Abel Matutes of Spain told Spanish National Radio Thursday.
   ``The Commission and the Community in general expect a lot from
the Spanish presidency,'' Matutes said.
   ``(Spain) has clear ideas and for that reason there is a
possibility of agreement or at least noticeable progress on
important issues like `social space' and monetary unity,'' Matutes
said.
   Gonzalez led the fight to double economic development funds by
1992 for the EEC's poorer regions, mainly in Spain, Greece,
Portugal, Italy and Ireland.
   The ``social space'' concept, criticized by British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher as bureaucratic ``jargon,'' aims to
increase development funds for poor areas and guarantee basic
workers' rights and salary levels as the borderless economic market
imposes much expected pressure on labor.
   But government sources, who asked not to be named, said
Gonzalez, leader of the ruling Socialist party and a former labor

   The stock market showed a modest gain today in
another sluggish session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.38 to 2,109.89 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 661 up, 535 down and
552 unchanged.
   Stocks have been drifting all week while traders await the Labor
Department report Friday morning on the employment situation for
September.
   Brokers say traders have been especially cautious because of
expectations that the figures will show job growth at a rate faster
than the Federal Reserve would like to see in its efforts to keep
inflation from reviving.
   A good many analysts doubt that the employment figures, however
they turn out, will end the market's recent period of lethargy.
   They note that Wall Street will still have to contend with
memories of last October's crash, whose approaching first
anniversary is getting a lot of publicity, and uncertainties about
the election in November.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Motors dropped [ to
74]; Sears Roebuck gained ] to 40[, and Union Carbide was down \ at

   TW Services climbed 1~ to 26}. The investment firm of Coniston
Partners offered $28 a share for the TW stock it doesn't already
own.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

index was up .50 at 300.47.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 77.16 million shares at

   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said today
the next president and Congress must find a solution to the
problems plaguing the savings and loan industry or they ``could
affect the entire U.S. economy.''
   Dole's comments, on the Senate floor, came a day after the
government's top thrift industry regulator raised the estimated
price tag for cleaning up the industry from $31 billion to $45
billion or more.
   Dole, of Kansas, told his fellow senators that the issue
transcends politics.
   ``The time has come to stop the political finger-pointing,'' he
said. ``There is plenty of blame to go around. Congress, the Carter
administration, the Reagan administration, a number of state
legislatures, federal regulators and industry management must all
share some of the responsibility for the thrift industry's
problems,'' Dole said.
   ``We should not let politics affect our better judgment. The
problems facing the thrift industry are serious. If unaddressed,
they could affect the entire U.S. economy,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, which regulates federally chartered S&Ls, argued for
Congress to raise the ceiling on how much it can borrow to bail out
ailing thrifts.
   Just three months ago, Wall had raised his estimate from $22
billion to $31 billion. Now, he says, the bailout cost is in the
range of $45 billion to $50 billion.
   Some private analysts put the cost as high as $100 billion.
   But Dole said today that more money, by itself, is not the
answer.
   ``It's going to take time to come up with a responsible,
workable solution, and, unfortunately, the 100th Congress doesn't
have any left,'' the Republican leader said, urging President
Reagan's succesor and the Congress sworn in next January to make
finding a solution a top priority.
   The House Banking Committee voted 29-22 on Wednesday to expand
the board's borrowing limit from $10.8 billion in bonds to $15.8
billion. The move is opposed by the industry, which pays an
assessment to retire the 30-year bonds.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, said the
Senate would be ``hard put'' to oppose an expansion of the bank
board's borrowing limit, since last summe, when Congress authorized
$10.8 billion in borrowing over three years, the Senate pushed for
a higher limit of $15 billion.
   The bank board already has issued $3.75 billion in bonds. The
Banking Committee bill would permit the bank board to float the
remaining amount as soon as needed rather than spreading it over
the next two years.
   So far this year, the bank board has committed $20 billion to
close or merge 122 troubled thrifts.
   Wall said his agency's resources could cover the newly estimated
cost, but only by placing ``an exceedingly heavy burden'' on the
industry. Thrift institutions currently pay more than twice as much
as their competitors, commercial banks, for deposit insurance and
Wall said that differential would have to continue over 30 years if
his agency did not get help.
   The head of the industry's largest trade group, the U.S. League
of Savings Institutions, said extending the differential for 30
years ``would be an intolerable burden.''
   ``The special assessment has made the difference between profit
and loss for 69 solvent savings institutions so far this year. In
other words, in the process of removing 122 insolvents,
(regulators) have been driving another 69 which are now healthy
closer to becoming problem cases,'' league Chairman Theo H. Pitt
Jr. said.
   Wall said taxpayers would not necessarily have to pay the bill
for boosting the bank board's resources. He listed alternatives,
without endorsing any, that included: requiring institutions to
place 1 percent of their deposits into the S&L insurance fund,
borrowing from the insurance fund for commercial banks or from the
Federal Reserve, and charging borrowers a fee for mortgages
provided by S&Ls.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange ended
higher, near the day's best levels, Thursday, as trading activity
continued at a relatively brisk pace for the second consecutive day.
   Dealers said the market repeated the pattern of Wednesday's
performance, when modest buying by institutions was more than
matched by aggressive short-covering by market makers.
Short-covering is the buying of shares to fulfill agreements to
sell them.
   ``Market makers have been caught a little bit on the hop here
and didn't have the stock to meet it,'' said one equity salesman.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchane 100-share index rose 12.6
points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 1,838.9, just 2 points below
its best level.
   Volume was 573 million shares, nearly matching Wednesday's
relatively healthy 574.5 million shares.
   Consumer-oriented issues were among the market's major gainers
as players turned to stocks that had suffered recently due to
worries that British interest rates could move yet higher in the
near term.
   Such fears have eased somewhat, with some players cautiously
hoping that interest rates might have peaked.
   Even should bank base lending rates go above their current 12
percent, many players anticipate a bit of a breathing space in the
meantime.
   ``There's no fear at the moment of a sudden hike,'' in rates, a
salesman said.

<HEAD>Union Pacific Resources To Consolidate Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Corp. said Thursday it
will close the regional offices of its energy and mining subsidiary
in Denver and Houston and consolidate those operations in Fort
Worth by the end of the year.
   The consolidation and reduced overhead from the recently
announced sales of the company's Wilmington, Calif., refinery and
its Calnev Pipe Line Co. should help the Union Pacific Resources
Co. save at least $45 million a year, said William L. Adams,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   The consolidation at Union Pacific's corporate headquarters will
add 400 jobs to the 550 that already exist in Fort Worth, but the
reorganization will eliminate about 400 jobs throughout the
company, he said.
   ``It is clear that the expense of maintaining our regional
offices cannot be justified in today's volatile and depressed oil
pricing environment,'' Adams said. ``Thus, we are streamlining to
maintain our position as a low-cost finder and producer of oil and
gas.
   ``We're going to do everything we can to cushion the blow for
those affected, including ample severance pay and out-placement
services,'' Adams said. ``While we will close offices in Denver and
Houston, we will still be active participants in the energy
business in both areas.''
   Union Pacific Resources will maintain production offices in Rock
Springs, Wyo., and Wilmington and the firm will continue to operate
its minerals group from Denver, Adams said. Operations of the
firm's Canadian subsidiary, Union Pacific Resources Inc. of
Calgary, will be unchanged.
   Since the 1986 oil price collapse that sent prices from $24 to
$10 a barrel, Union Pacific has been affected by the nationwide
trend in which the domestic oil and gas industry lost some 400,000
jobs, Adams said.
   ``In response to the 1986 collapse, we have instituted various
cost containment measures that, including this reorganization, will
result in annual savings in excess of $267 million before tax,''
Adams said.
   Union Pacific Resources now has 375 people in its Denver office
and 325 in Houston.
   Union Pacific also announced three executive appointments as
part of the consolidation. On Jan. 1, Robert S. Jackson, now vice
president-finance, becomes executive vice president and chief
financial officer. Dale W. Bossert, vice president and regional
manager-Denver, becomes vice president of production and George
Lindahl III, regional exploration manager-Houston, becomes vice
president-exploration.
   Union Pacific Resources had net income of $183 million on sales
of $1.4 billion last year.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De Laurentiis Entertainment Group Inc., which
is in bankruptcy proceedings, said it had received preliminary
offers from three companies interested in buying a controlling
interest.
   The offers came from movie maker Cannon Group Inc., video disk
maker Image Entertainment Inc. and privately held movie company
Atlantic Entertainment Group, DEG announced late Wednesday.
   The production company founded by Italian film maker Dino De
Laurentiis faltered for lack of movie hits and in August filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. Under the voluntary bankruptcy proceeding, any
purchase of DEG would need the approval of the company's creditors
and the court.
   DEG assets excluded from the bankruptcy include an affiliated
film-financing company called DEG Film Partners, a newly formed
production arm called Onyx Entertainment and DEG's 32-acre studio
in North Carolina.
   DEG's productions include the movies ``Crimes of the Heart'' and
``Weeds'' and the TV mini series ``Noble House.''
   The company said it had hired Oppenheimer & Co. to evaluate the
offers.

<HEAD>British Goverment Raises Doubts About Its Free-market Policies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government's demand that Kuwait cut in
half its stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC has drawn fire from
critics who fear it might discourage foreign investment in the
already depressed London stock market.
   The government says it acted to defend the free market against a
cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, to which
Kuwait belongs.
   British Petroleum is Britain's largest company, and the Persian
Gulf nation of Kuwait is its biggest shareholder.
   Representatives of big British brokerage firms charged that the
action departs from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's commitment
to letting the market alone.
   ``The government's whole free-market policy is showing itself to
be either confused or shallow,'' said Humphrey Harrison, director
of energy research at the London investment firm Kitcat and Aitken.
   ``Perhaps a new wave of protectionism is coming in, government
intervention in what had been a free and open market,'' he said.
   ``Uncertainty never helps investment,'' said Leo Doyle, an
economist at the London investment firm Kleinwort Grieveson Ltd.
``You might well see equity prices fall quite substantially. I
think it's fair to say it's another nail in the coffin.''
   The Kuwait Investment Office, the Gulf state's London-based
investment arm, was ordered on Tuesday to reduce its $5 billion
stake in British Petroleum from 22 percent to 9.9 percent over the
next year.
   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government said Kuwait's holding
likely would conflict with the public interest. Analysts said
Kuwait stood to lose nearly 400 million pounds ($676 million) in
what would be one of the world's biggest divestitures.
   The Kuwait government said only that it was considering its
options, but pro-government Kuwaiti newspapers urged retaliation.
   The order could chill relations between the two countries, and
some analysts speculated that Kuwait would review all its British
investments.
   One-fifth of Kuwait's estimated $80 billion in overseas
holidings are in Britain, including a recently disclosed 5.1 stake
in Midland Bank PLC, one of Britan's largest commercial banks.
   Critics in Britain called the decision inconsistent,
hypocritical, punitive and ungrateful toward Kuwait, a long-time
British ally.
   The Daily Telegraph quoted one unidentified analyst as saying it
smacked of a ``you can't trust the Arabs'' attitude.
   But Trade Secretary Lord Young insisted the decision reaffirmed
free-market beliefs, saying Kuwait ``is a member of OPEC, one of
the great cartels of the world. We will not be part of that
cartel.''
   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, on whose recommendation
the government acted, expressed concerns that Kuwait might try to
boost its own oil earnings by forcing British Petroleum to pump
less North Sea oil or cut exploration and development.
   The conservative Financial Times supported the decision, saying,
``the rules were properly applied, the argument was fair and the
outcome correct.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, a strong advocate of free-market policies, has
presided over a capitalist revolution in Britain since taking
office in 1979, selling off state-owned industries and encouraging
public share-ownership.
   In addition, when the government reviews large acquisitions of
British shares, it is usually with the aim of safeguarding
competition.
   At the same time Britain has a history of retaining ``golden
shares'' which guarantee ultimate control of companies it views as
strategically vital.
   It also has limited foreign holdings to a total of 15 percent in
other privatizations.
   But, ``there is a fundamental difference (in the British
Petroleum case),'' Harrison said. In previous cases, ``those things
were notified in advance, with the foreign investor knowing in
advance what the terms and conditions were.''
   It is common on Britain's takeover scene for British targets of
foreign bidders to wage emotional campaigns to keep themselves
British. The opposition Labor party also is always quick to raise
national sentiments when attacking the government's free-market
policies.
   What prompted outcry over the government's British Petroleum
decision was the fact that Kuwait had made unsolicited, legally
binding pledges not to increase its stake or to use it to ``further
any other commercial or political interest of Kuwait.''
   Also, Kuwait's purchase of the 1.316 billion shares had bailed
the government out of an embarrassing situation last fall.
   Kuwait's intervention relieved the government from having to
fulfill its potentially costly promise to buy back unsold British
Petroleum shares after its sale of its one-third stake in the oil
giant coincided with the stock market crash and flopped, leaving
underwriters holding large amounts of stock.
   Harrison said the government has twice intervened against the
free market in British Petroleum's case _ first by guaranteeing to
buy back unsold shares, and now by its action against Kuwait.
   ``Why privatize British Petroleum if it's of such strategic
significance?'' he asked, noting that the government didn't retain
a golden share or previously limit foreign holdings in British
Petroleum.
   Many analysts also were shocked by the size of the reduction
ordered, saying they had expected a cut to 15 percent, and by the
deadline set for disposing of the shares.
   Unless the government extends the time period for Kuwait to sell
the 700 million British Petroleum shares, the effect on the
post-crash market will be ``quite serious,'' Harrison said.
   ``There is going to be a perception that maybe we've reached the
zenith of the free market, certainly a perception by foreign
investors that competition policy is by no means well-defined,'' he
said.
   ``It will knock London as a financial center,'' Harrison charged.

   Trans World Airlines Inc. Chairman Carl Icahn
reportedly has held discussions with Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo on the sale of ailing Eastern Airlines to TWA.
   The talks center on a friendly transaction that would be
acceptable to Icahn, Lorenzo and Eastern's unions, according to
sources close to the situation who requested anonymity. Miami-based
Eastern is a major subsidiary of Texas Air.
   The discussions with Icahn included representatives of Eastern's
unions, the sources told The Associated Press today.
   New York developer Donald Trump, meanwhile, said Wednesday that
he was close to agreement with Lorenzo on the sale of Eastern's
three-city air shuttle service to Trump, and that a contract could
be signed by next week. Trump reportedly would pay more than $300
million cash for the shuttle.
   Eastern declined comment on the developments concerning both
Icahn and Trump.
   ``Quite frankly, we're not commenting on either report. It's our
policy not to comment on rumors,'' said Eastern spokesman Robin
Matell in Miami.
   TWA had no comment on the situation, said Mark Buckstein, TWA's
senior vice president and general counsel who was acting as a
spokesman for the airline. Trump and his representatives were
unavailable for comment today.
   On Wednesday, unions at Eastern reacted angrily to a report that
Texas Air was discussing the possible sale of its East Coast
shuttle to Trump.
   The pilots union warned it would seek a court order to block any
such deal, and the head of the machinists union suggested his union
would do the same. The unions successfully blocked an attempt
earlier this year by Texas Air to transfer the shuttle operation
from Eastern to a new subsidiary.
   The unions appear to favor a sale of all of Eastern as a going
concern to a friendly acquirer, while they are opposed to the sale
or transfer of its assets such as the shuttle.
   Icahn was approached a few weeks ago by representatives of the
machinists union at Eastern about the possible sale of the carrier,
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said today.
   Eastern lost $89.8 million in the second quarter of the year,
and recently laid off around 3,000 employees.

<HEAD>Clients Not Deserting Drexel; Some Accuse Government of Unfair
Tactics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s battle
over charges of securities fraud, clients aren't abandoning the
Wall Street powerhouse that pioneered the $100 billion high-yield
``junk bond'' market.
   On the contrary, they're extolling the virtues of Drexel and its
employees, particularly the financier who largely created that
market _ Michael Milken. Some clients go so far as to accuse
government prosecutors of witch-hunt tactics.
   The unabashed defense of Drexel _ even from clients the
government claims were cheated _ suggests the 2-year-old crackdown
on Wall Street corruption, heralded for bringing speculator Ivan
Boesky to justice, may now be creating a backlash.
   Certainly, the lines of distinction that separated the bad guys
from the good are becoming blurred. Drexel and Milken, once seen as
arrogant, aggressive manipulators behind junk-bond financed
takeover deals, are taking on underdog roles in the wake of the
charges leveled Sept. 7 by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Moreover, the zealous loyalty Drexel is inspiring suggests most
clients are little concerned with whether the firm or Milken may
have technically violated securities laws. What counts more is the
firm's extraordinary ability to finance projects from day care
centers to toxic waste cleanups to employee buyouts of big
companies.
   If results are the principal test of customer satisfaction on
Wall Street, Drexel passes with flying colors.
   ``I have nothing but accolades for those guys,'' said Stuart
Subotnick, Metromedia Inc. executive vice president, who recruited
Drexel four years ago to help the company refinance by issuing $1.3
billion in junk bonds, which at the time was the biggest such
transaction in history.
   ``I must say to you that in 1984, they were head and shoulders
above other firms with respect to their ability, pricing, and in
the end, on execution,'' Subotnick said. ``Everything Drexel
promised to do and then some, they did.''
   Subotnick said he was so impressed with Drexel he recently
recommended the firm to another large company that wants to
refinance.
   James McCloskey, vice president for finance at Concurrent
Computer Corp., a New Jersey concern that has merged with
Massachusetts Computer Corp. in a Drexel-financed deal, also
expressed admiration.
   ``The financing was raised, Drexel did perform,'' he said.
``That's the ultimate proof of the pudding.''
   Some clients are so passionate about their defense of the firm
and Milken that they see the legal struggle as the tip of a more
profound fight, which pits a new breed of entrepreneur against an
established economic order.
   In their view, Milken's visionary talents and financing power
have aroused the wrath of rivals and Washington policymakers, who
see high-yield bonds as a risky form of debt, and are intent on
destroying the 42-year-old financier.
   ``He hasn't yet actually been accused of culpability for the
Mexican earthquake, or for Hurricane Gilbert, or even for the
`greenhouse effect' that as you know threatens terrestrial life as
we know it,'' said Ingersoll Publications Co. chairman Ralph
Ingersoll, a Drexel client and Milken friend.
   ``Otherwise there does not seem to be a lot that a frustrated
bureaucracy, bent on a Salem-style witch hunt, hasn't attempted to
blame on this man.''
   Milken, who appeared at a recent publishing conference sponsored
by Ingersoll, declined to talk about the allegations against him or
other aspects of the government investigation. But Milken suggested
he's been treated harshly and his work is widely misunderstood.
   ``I think we probably haven't done a good job explaining,'' he
said. ``But you know, sometimes something's a two-way street. You
have to care, to want to understand, too.''
   The high-yield bonds Milken is credited with developing are debt
securities that pay high interest, often issued by companies that
cannot get investment-grade status from major credit-rating
agencies.
   Pilloried by critics as a weapon for funding hostile takeovers,
the high-yield bond market has emerged as an important source of
alternative long-term financing for hundreds of small and
medium-sized companies.
   For its part, Drexel has attempted to shed the image as a prime
purveyor of high-yield bonds for hostile takeovers, and now
promotes the idea that such securities serve more useful and
productive purposes.
   A blitz of Drexel advertisements suggest its high-yield bonds
finance only the most morally upright enterprises, such as
Kinder-Care Inc., a network of day-care and pre-school learning
centers; Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., a housing developer; and
Unimar International Inc., a shipbuilder purchased by employees.
   The cover of Drexel's high-yield bond unit 1988 annual report is
an artist's rendition of typical smalltown U.S.A, replete with a
hospital, shopping mall and school, built on a rolled-out carpet of
high-yield bonds.
   For almost two years, Drexel and Milken have been under intense
scrutiny by the SEC and Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, the
result of a deal struck with Boesky, a convicted insider trader, to
turn state's evidence and identify others in his illegal acts.
   Last month, the SEC finally accused Drexel, Milken and three
other employees of secretly scheming with Boesky to violate a range
of securities laws that centered on some of the biggest takeover
deals of the decade.
   But the charges seemed based mostly on Boesky's claims and fell
far short of speculation that dozens of Drexel employees would be
implicated.
   The U.S. attorney's office has yet to bring any charges, and
there is talk that the grand jury investigation it is directing has
been delayed. There also have been other indications that
investigators have found it difficult to obtain conclusive evidence
to support Boesky's revelations.
   Even before the SEC filed its charges, investigators had come
under attack from Drexel and its supporters for leaking sensitive
details of the probes to pressure the brokerage into settlement
talks. Officials denied those allegations and continue to
characterize their pursuit of Wall Street wrongdoers as an
important part of the campaign against white-collar crime.
   Perhaps the most serious of the SEC's charges against Drexel are
that it cheated two important clients, Maxxam Group Inc. and Wickes
Cos., in the midst of prominent takeover deals a few years ago.
   But if Maxxam and Wickes believe they were victimized they
haven't said so or moved to sue Drexel on their own.
   Instead, Wickes issued a statement supporting Drexel, which is
helping Wickes' management finance an acquisition of the company.
Wickes said the SEC action would have no impact on that transaction.
   Other Drexel clients in the midst of deals also have come to its
defense.
   Ernest Bates, president, chairman and chief executive of
American Shared Hospital Services in San Francisco, said he
expected no adverse impact on his company's proposed public
offering of stocks and debt securities.
   ``We continue to have the highest confidence in Drexel,'' he
said. ``We trust the current litigation will be resolved promptly
and that these key financing mechanisms will continue to be widely
available in the marketplace.''

   Coniston Partners proposed Thursday to acquire
foods giant TW Services Inc. for $1.13 billion in a friendly deal
but held out the possibility of launching a hostile tender offer if
the bid is rebuffed.
   The proposal, which would pay $28 in cash for each of the 39.27
million TW shares Coniston does not already own, had been expected.
The aggressive New York investment firm acknowledged two weeks ago
that it had amassed a 19 percent stake in TW and might seek to
acquire the company, whose operations include the Denny's
restaurant chain.
   TW spokesman James Ryan said the board had received a letter
from Coniston and was reviewing the offer. But shortly after
Coniston's stake was disclosed last month, the TW board indicated
intended to remain independent.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, TW stock jumped $1.75 a share to
$26.62{ in afternoon trading.
   In the letter, Coniston said that while it considered the
offering price to be ``full and fair,'' it was ``willing to
consider offering more if (TW) can demonstrate sufficient business
prospects to justify doing so.''
   Wall Street analysts agreed the price was reasonable, but some
have estimated that TW's break-up value might be as high as $34 a
share.
   The Coniston principals have said that they consider TW to be a
prime candidate for a leveraged buyout. In such a buyout, the
purchaser relies on borrowed money, secured by a target company's
assets, to finance an acquisition. The loans are repaid out of cash
flow and, occasionally, the sale of assets.
   In this case, however, Coniston hinted it would not completely
dismember TW, which also operates food services companies and a
small chain of nursing homes.
   ``We would like to work with operating management to build and
enhance the company's core food service and restaurant business,''
Coniston said in its letter.
   The partnership, which made the bid through SWT Associates
Limited Partnership, is going to be ``a major force to reckon
with,'' said Lloyd Rixe, an analyst with the investment firm D.A.
Davidson & Co. in Great Falls, Mont.
   ``It's anybody's guess if someone else will surface,'' he said.
   Coniston paid an average $19 a share for the 9.28 million TW
shares it purchased over a period of days in September. Roughly 7.2
million of those shares had belonged to billionaire takeover
strategist Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon Inc.
   After meeting with Coniston principals late last month, TW's
chief executive officer, Frank Salizzoni, said, ``In view of the
bright operating prospects for the company, we believe that the
shareholders will be served best by the company's remaining
independent.''
   Coniston principal Paul Tierney Jr. said in a telephone
interview that he hoped that the much more specific terms _ such as
price and financing _ spelled out in Thursday's letter would give
the TW board reason to reconsider.
   If the board again rejected the overture, Tierney said, the
partnership might proceed with a hostile tender offer directly to
shareholders. Coniston requested a response by Wednesday.
   Formed in late 1986 as a result of the liquidation of Trans
World Corp., TW Services reported profits of $47.2 million on
revenue of $2.5 billion last year. The company's $850 million
acquisition of the Denny's chain in late 1987 is expected to boost
revenues to the $3.5 billion mark this year.
   TW attributed its strong second-quarter performance to Denny's
better than expected showing. Since the acquisition, TW has trimmed
staff and embarked on a program to remodel the 1,220-restaurant
chain. Over the next five years, the company plans to expand the
chain by 500 restaurants.
   ``They've been making claims that Denny's has surpassed Wendy's
as the No. 3'' restaurant chain in the nation, said Jay Freedman,
an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co.
   TW also owns the Chicago-based Canteen Corp., which contracts
food, vending and recreational services throughout the nation at
places like stadiums and national parks. Ryan said Canteen has more
than 1,700 accounts and about $1.5 billion in annual sales.
   The company also owns Spartan Food Systems Inc. of Spartanburg,
S.C. The unit operates more than 400 Hardee's restaurants and 200
Quincy Family Steak houses, mostly in the southeastern part of the
country.
   Coniston Partners, with a warchest estimated at about $700
million, typically takes large positions in companies and uses that
clout to force management to sell the company or make changes that
boost the stock price.
   Coniston recently emerged from a bitter proxy battle with
Gillette Co. that saw the partners narrowly lose their bid for four
seats on the razor-blade maker's board of directors. Ultimately the
two sides reached a settlement that included a stock buyback and a
standstill agreement.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Denies Defense Motion To Disqualify Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected an
unusual request by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to disqualify the
judge presiding over the government's fraud case against the Wall
Street firm.
   The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said in a
written ruling that the move by attorneys for Drexel and other
defendants in the case to remove U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack
was premature.
   Pollack previously scheduled his own hearing for next Tuesday to
hear arguments on the defense effort to remove him.
   The defense is seeking Pollack's removal on grounds his wife has
an interest in a corporate transaction financed by Drexel.
   Defense attorneys had said in an extraordinary petition to the
appeals court last week that Pollack's involvement created an
``appearance of impropriety.'' They apparently feared that if
Pollack issued a favorable ruling to their clients a higher court
might overturn it on appeal.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which had sought Pollack
for the case when it sued Drexel Sept. 7 in U.S. District Court,
had challenged the defense effort to remove him in a filing with
the appeals court Wednesday. The SEC said the connection between
Pollack's wife and Drexel was extremely remote and was not grounds
for prejudice.
   Drexel, its high-yield bond financier Michael Milken and others
have been accused by the SEC of violating a range of securities
laws in alleged schemes with Ivan F. Boesky, the now-imprisoned
inside trader who has been cooperating in the government's
investigation of Wall Street corruption.
   The defendants have denied the accusations.

   U.S. Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin
and one of her predecessors offered sharply contrasting opinions
Thursday on whether the United States has lost its competitive edge
in world trade.
   ``I'm not sure we're behind,'' Mrs. McLaughlin said at the third
annual Rhode Island Conference on Labor-Management Relations.
``Right now, exports are up and the trade deficit is falling.''
   But Ray Marshall, labor secretary during the Carter
administration, said that while some economic measures of
competitiveness may not indicate a decline, the United States has
fallen behind in productivity and real income levels.
   Marshall, in a speech to more than 300 business and academic
officials, said the next president will have to define a clear set
of goals before the country will again become competitive with
other countries.
   ``We have a passive trade policy. They have an active trade
policy,'' he said. ``The country with an active trade policy will
win because they know where they want to get and how they're going
to get there.''
   Mrs. McLaughlin, in an interview and an upbeat speech to the
group, disagreed and said the Labor Department's present programs
will get the job done.
   The United States, unlike Japan and some other Western
countries, does not have a centralized economy, so the government
cannot impose the goals that Marshall suggested, Mrs. McLaughlin
said.
   The speakers at the conference agreed that more attention should
be paid to improving management systems and the education and
services provided to workers.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said issues such as parental leave should be
negotiated between unions and management, rather than imposed by
the federal government.
   ``I'm saddened that they seem to want to push for federal
legislation,'' she said. ``If there's federal legislation, then
there's less incentive to negotiate.''
   Robert B. McKersie, an industrial relations professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said such issues give unions
a wedge to organize industries where workers have so far not been
interested.
   ``While unions have seen little recent organizing success, it
appears that employees do not appear to be satisfied with the
status quo,'' McKersie said. ``The workforce appears to have
unsatisfied demands in areas such as pay equity, career
development, day care, (and) maternity leave.''
   Marshall, now a professor at the University of Texas, said
productivity per worker, in and of itself, is not the reason the
country has declined relative to Korea, Japan and other economic
powers.
   ``We're four times as productive as the Koreans. The problem is
the wage differential is six to one,'' he said. ``So even if we're
more productive, they can undercut us with lower wages.''
   Marshall added that the United States will never be able to cut
wages to the point where they are competitive with the Koreans and
should not try to do so.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said she views education as the key to keeping
the workforce competitive.
   ``Simply put, we have to get serious, together, many of you in
this room, about public education,'' she said. ``The fact is that
the current pool of applicants for entry-level jobs lacks basic
skills such as reading, writing, problem-solving and
communication.''

   Assets of the nation's 453 money market mutual
funds rose $182 million in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $267.15 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $267.6 million drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 224 general purpose funds rose $445.7 million to $85.12
billion, assets of 103 broker-dealer funds dropped $916.2 million
to $112.47 billion, and assets of 126 institutional funds rose
$652.5 million to $69.56 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.48 percent from 7.43 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 7.43 percent from 7.40
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
35 days, up from 34 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.03 percent as of Wednesday from 6.02 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.11 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.76
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.75 the
previous week. Yields were 8.09 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.04
percent; 8.33 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.31 percent; and
8.59 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

<HEAD>Indictment Of Polk County Citrus Company To Be First Of Many</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fraud indictment of a Florida citrus
company is the first growing out of a 22-month nationwide
investigation of illegal citrus practices involving hundreds of
millions of dollars, federal officials said Thursday.
   ``It was the first indictment, but the investigation is not
limited to Florida,'' said Brad Knutter, supervisor of the the
Tampa U.S. Customs fraud group which is coordinating the probe.
   The lengthy probe, dubbed ``Operation Orange Squeeze,'' is an
unprecedented investigation by the U.S. Customs Service of the
citrus industry in Florida and other citrus-producing states,
officals said.
   A Highland City citrus processor, its Ohio parent company and
two of its former presidents were indicted Tuesday, accused of
conspiring to bilk the federal government in a customs rebate scam.
   Allsun Pure Juice Corp., Ohio Pure Foods Inc. of Akron, Ohio,
and two former Allsun executives, Robert W. Hurley, 57, of Lakeland
and Herman B. Cohen, 67, of Ormond Beach, were charged with
mislabeling export products between 1983 and 1986 in order to
collect $776,458 in U.S. Customs rebates.
   Authorities charge the defendants attempted to cheat the
government by labeling almost 2 million gallons of citrus pulpwash
as frozen concentrated orange juice in 36 export shipments.
   Pulpwash is the residual citrus product left after the primary
juice claim those rebates for
exporting pulpwash, an inferior citrus byproduct, authorities say.
Trying to pass the pulpwash off as concentrated orange juice was a
fraud, the indictment says.
   The defendants have so far declined to comment on charges listed
in the indictment.
   Custom laws allow companies 99 percent refund of import duties
if products made from imported merchandise are later exported. The
rebate also is allowed if the export is produced from a domestic
substitute of the same kind and quality as the duty-paid import.
   Officials say more charges are expected against other exporters.
   ``Pulpwash may be one of the more fraudulent activities, but
we're not limiting the investigation to that,'' Knutter said.
   In order to track exports, he said, investigators have to trace
shipping records and trucking reports involving a number of
companies.
   ``This is just the start,'' said Customs agent Steve Bowman.
``We'll be busy for a while.''
   Bowman said investigators discovered a number of citrus
concentrate exporters involved in the practice of mislabeling
pulpwash as concentrate to get the rebates.
   When asked if future cases involved as much as hundreds of
millions of dollars, Bowman said, ``Overall, that would be a
conservative estimate.''
   Customs officials said the agency's findings could hurt the
credibility of Florida's citrus industry.
   ``Operation Orange Squeeze has exposed a situation that could
have a devastating effect on the Florida citrus industry,'' said
Customs agent Bonni Tischler in Tampa. ``Following natural
disasters like the freezes of recent years and the citrus canker
infestations, the last thing the Florida orange growers and
processors need is a company defrauding the government in order to
make a few extra dollars.''
   Only about 3 percent of the Florida industry involves citrus
concentrate exporting, according to Dr. Robert Behr, economic
research director for the Citrus Department.
   Processors legitimately sell pulpwash to beverage companies who
use it to produce diluted citrus drinks.
   Revenue in the industry totaled more than $3 billion last
season, he said. Of that amount, about $100 million comes from
concentrate exports, according to Behr.

   Grain futures prices advanced on rumors of
purchases by the Soviet Union and China while soybeans declined in
trading Thursday at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices hit new contract highs amid talk that the Chinese
may be in the market for U.S. wheat and reports that the Common
Market plans to raise their wheat export prices, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``That would make theirs less competitive and ours more
competitive,'' he said.
   Rumors that the Soviet Union bought a million tons of corn
sparked a buying wave in the corn pit, and continued hope that the
U.S.-Soviet grain pact may be near added support to prices,
Lespinasse said.
   Soybean prices fell in all but one contract month, pressured by
bearish crop estimates from influential private analyst Sparks
Commodities, he said. Sparks' figures put the U.S. soybean crop at
1.543 billion bushels, about 70 million more than the U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates last month.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 6\ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.32{ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 4{ cents higher, with December at $2.98 a bushel; oats were
1 cent lower to 1 cent higher, with December at $2.46{ a bushel;
and soybeans were 10 cents lower to 2{ cents higher, with November
at $8.13 a bushel.

   The stock market struggled to a small gain
Thursday as traders awaited a new signal on the pace of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.24 to 2,107.75,
posting a single-digit change for the fifth consecutive session.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
782 up, 612 down and 530 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 153.57 million
shares, down from 175.13 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 182.58 million shares.
   Stocks have been drifting all week while traders await the Labor
Department report Friday morning on the employment situation for
September.
   Brokers say investors have been especially cautious because of
expectations that the figures will show job growth at a rate faster
than the Federal Reserve would like to see in its efforts to keep
inflation from reviving.
   A good many analysts doubt that the employment figures, however
they turn out, will end the market's recent period of lethargy.
   They note that Wall Street will still have to contend with
memories of last October's crash, whose approaching first
anniversary is getting a lot of publicity, and uncertainties about
the election in November.
   None of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow moved as much as a
point. Among actively traded blue chips, General Motors dropped ]
to 74[; Sears Roebuck lost \ to 39{, and Union Carbide was down \
at 25~.
   TW Services climbed 1} to 26|. The investment firm of Coniston
Partners offered $28 a share for the TW stock it doesn't already
own.
   Hospital Corp. of America rose 1\ to 43]. The company said a
committee of directors served notice that it would reject a
$47-a-share buyout proposal being considered by a management group.
Some traders evidently took that as a possible prelude to another
bid.
   Pillsbury led the active list, down \ at 57~. Grand Metropolitan
PLC said it completed a financing package for its $60-a-share offer
to acquire Pillsbury.
   Seagate Technology, which said late Wednesday it would post a
loss for its most recent quarter, dropped | to 7] in the
over-the-counter market.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $5.48 billion, or 0.20
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .31 to 153.93.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.76 to 312.66, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.53 at 272.39.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.63 to 385.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 301.14, up 1.17.

   Lee Iacocca thinks you should change your oil.
   Not the 30-weight in your LeBaron, but the oil in your salad and
your marinara sauce.
   The chairman of Chrysler Corp. was in Macy's on Thursday to
promote Villa Nicola olive oil, vinegar and wine, products of the
Tuscany region of Italy where Iacocca bought an estate in 1984.
   ``You can't get this many people out when you're showing a new
car,'' Iacocca said as about 200 people crowded around a stand in
Macy's gourmet food section for a taste and an autograph.
   Iacocca said his family used to bring olive oil and wine from
his estate to American friends, who eventually said, ``Why don't
you put a label on it and sell some of it?''
   Now, Villa Nicola Ltd. markets extra virgin olive oil, balsamic
and Chianti vinegars and red table wine, all of it produced in the
area around the estate, which is named after his father.
   If the company _ run by his daughter, Lia Nagy, and son-in-law
Ned Hentz _ ever turns a profit, the money will go to the Iacocca
Foundation, which funds diabetes research.
   ``It started as a hobby, it's not going to be a big business,''
Iacocca said. ``The olive oil, I think, is in a class with any
olive oil in the world.''
   The products were first sold in Detroit about a year ago, but
now can be found in speciality grocers in several states, including
New York, New Jersey, Ohio and Illinois.
   The customers who lined up for a look at Iacocca were treated to
food prepared according to the recipes of his mother, Antonietta,
including her marinara sauce, pesto sauce, sticky chicken wings and
cheese steaks.
   A liter of the olive oil sold for $19.75.
   ``I tasted the pesto with oil and it was very good,'' said Renee
Press of Long Island. ``I'm gonna try it, I have to watch my
cholesterol.
   ``Besides, I'm a Chrysler shareholder. I got it at $6 and sold
at $50. So I love him. I'll buy it.''

<HEAD>Money Supply Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in late September, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,032.5 billion in the week ended Sept. 26 from $3,037.4
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, decreased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,851.3 billion from $3,856.9 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $784.9 billion from $784.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,030.7 billion, a 3.8
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,843.6 billion, up 5.7 percent, while M1
rose 5.6 percent to an average of $782.6 billion.
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $81 million in
the week ended Sept. 28, compared with a decline of $162 million a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $914 million in the
week ended Wednesday, up from $556 million in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $575
million in the two weeks ended Oct. 5, in contrast to average net
borrowed reserves of $117 million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $282.8 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $283.4 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Kroger Lays Off 300 at Headquarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kroger Co. said Thursday it is laying off
about 300 employees at its Cincinnati headquarters as part of a
corporate restructuring it is undertaking while fighting two
takeover offers.
   Most of those being laid off have been notified and will have
their last days on the job Friday, company spokesman Paul Bernish
said.
   The layoffs ``basically cover everything from vice president to
the secretary level,'' Bernish said. About 500 employees will
remain at Kroger's headquarters.
   Kroger, the nation's largest supermarket operator, said the
layoffs and elimination of associated costs will save the company
at least $13 million a year.
   ``There is nothing more difficult than terminating the jobs of
so many dedicated and loyal employees. However, major expense
reductions are critical to the successful implementation of our
restructuring program,'' Kroger chairman Lyle Everingham said.
   Company officials said all of the affected employees are being
given ``separation packages'' that provide a maximum of six to nine
months' salary and continuing health-and-life insurance coverage
for up to one year. The packages also include pay for unused 1988
or 1989 vacation time, company-paid job placement assistance or up
to $2,500 reimbursement for tuition expenses.
   Everingham and Kroger president Joseph Pichler had said last
week that the layoffs, along with sales of some company stores,
real estate and food-processing plants, would all be part of the
restructuring.
   This week, the Maryland-based Haft family, which has a
reputation as a corporate raider, offered Kroger help in fighting
off a takeover bid in a contest the Hafts started.
   The Hafts, who control Dart Group Inc., the company which last
month began the bidding competition for Kroger, issued a statement
Wednesday that some analysts interpreted as an offer of assistance
to help Kroger fend off a threat from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co., a New York corporate takeover specialist.
   ``We would be interested in working with Kroger management to
enhance the restructuring program by providing additional equity,''
Dart executive Robert Haft said in his one-line statement,
referring to Kroger's proposed $4.6 billion, corporate
restructuring plan.
   Kohlberg's latest buyout offer is a $5.03 billion proposal made
Tuesday. Kroger publicly is still sticking to its commitment to
restructure itself and remain independent, rather than be taken
over. But industry analysts say the Kohlberg offer appears more
lucrative to Kroger shareholders, which would prevent Kroger
management from simply shrugging off the Kohlberg offer.
   Haft made his statement after learning rival Kohlberg had
increased its bid Tuesday for Kroger, which is based in Cincinnati.
The Hafts, of Landover, Md., opened the Kroger bidding Sept. 19
with an unsolicited offer of $55 per share, or $4.32 billion. The
Hafts have made no offer to increase their proposal.
   Kohlberg, in the best deal to date, proposes paying $50 in cash,
$11 in debentures and a continuing equity interest in the company
valued at $3 for each of Kroger's 78.6 million shares _ a deal
worth $64 a share.
   Kroger has offered in its restructuring program, which would
require layoffs and sale of some company stores and food processing
plants, to pay shareholders a $40 cash dividend, a debenture with a
trading value of $8 and a ``stub'' share of stock that company
officials say will trade at between $9 and $13 per share.
   Wall Street investors, however, estimate the stub's value at as
low as $5 per share.
   If Kroger were to turn to the Hafts for help, the family would
not represent a friendly alternative, said Gary Giblen, an analyst
with Houston investment adviser Rotan Mosle Inc. ``They are hardly
white knights. They're more like gray knights,'' Giblen said.
   This is not the first time the Hafts have competed with Kohlberg
for a takeover target. But in the past, companies have made deals
with Kohlberg to be rescued from the Hafts.
   ``It would be pretty funny to welcome the Hafts in with open
arms,'' Giblen said. ``Usually you welcome Kohlberg. This is a real
switch-a-roo.''
   At least four shareholders' lawsuits have been filed against
Kroger, contending that its restructuring plan would not be in the
shareholders' best interests.
   The 105-year-old Kroger Co. has 170,000 employees and 52,000
shareholders. The company's main businesses are its supermarkets
and convenience stores.

<HEAD>Rumored Chinese Purchase, Common Market Plans For Exports Spark
Wheat Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rumored Chinese plan to buy U.S. wheat and talk
that the Common Market plans to raise their wheat export prices
triggered a rally in wheat futures prices Thursday at the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Expectations that the Chinese may be in the market for wheat
also supported wheat prices, analysts said.
   In other markets, corn prices advanced, soybeans declined,
cattle prices were mostly higher, hog prices were mostly lower,
frozen pork bellies slid, gold gained, silver was lower and oil
prices dipped.
   Wheat prices hit new contract highs amid continued hope for a
Chinese purchase and the rumors of the Common Market's plans, said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Higher export prices of Common Market wheat ``would make theirs
less competitive and ours more competitive,'' he said.
   Rumors that the Soviet Union bought a million tons of corn
sparked a buying wave in the corn pit, Lespinasse said.
   Soybean prices were pressured by bearish crop estimates from
influential private analyst Sparks Commodities, he said.
   Wheat settled 3} cents to 6{ cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.32} a bushel; corn was { cent to 4{
cents higher, with December at $2.98 a bushel; oats were 2 cents
lower to { cent higher, with December at $2.46\ a bushel; and
soybeans were 10\ cents lower to 2} cents higher, with November at
$8.12} a bushel.
   Cattle prices surged at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where
traders bought on ideas that supplies will tighten up in the fourth
quarter. They seemed to ignore near-term fundamentals of lackluster
boxed beef sales and slow feed-yard trade _ both indications that
demand is slight, said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with
Thompson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   The hog market fell under the influence of lower cash hog
prices, while pork bellies were pressured because of large stocks
in storage, Stanley said.
   Cattle prices settled unchanged to .57 cent higher with October
at 72.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .43
cent higher, with October at 81.77 cents a pound; hogs were .38
cent lower to .10 cent higher, with October at 40.02 cents a pound;
and pork bellies were .20 cent to .78 cent lower, with February at
48.67 cents a pound.
   Gold prices at the New York Commodity Exchange rallied on
expectations that U.S. Labor Department figures to be released
Friday would show an improved job picture for September, said
analyst Jack Barbanel of Gruntal & Co. Inc. in New York.
   A slight stabilization in crude oil prices, which have plunged
lately, also was considered slightly bullish, he said.
   Gold was $2.70 to $3.10 higher, with the contract for delivery
in October at $403.80 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to 1.5 cents
lower, with October at $6.288 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices settled mostly lower after a rally on mostly
technical factors earlier in the session at the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate rose 6 cents
to settle at $12.66 a barrel, but other contract months settled as
much as 15 cents lower. The near-term contract had been up as much
as 30 cents during the session.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the November
contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .06 cent to settle at
39.50 cents a gallon, while home heating oil slipped 0.52 cent to
37.24 cents a gallon. Other contract months finished lower.

<HEAD>Possible Eastern Sale to TWA Reunites Former Opponents</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Eastern Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reported talks on Texas Air Corp. possibly
selling its troubled Eastern Airlines subsidiary to rival Trans
World Airlines Inc. bring two former bitter foes back together.
   Carl Icahn, head of TWA, and Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas
Air, are tenacious financiers who warred over control of TWA three
years ago.
   A lot has changed since then, for both men and for the wild
world of the deregulated airline business.
   Lorenzo, whose Texas Air empire went on to acquire Eastern for
$676 million after his TWA bid failed, apparently has decided that
running an unwieldy and fractious airline company is too much
trouble.
   He is believed to be looking to sell parts or all of Miami-based
Eastern, which has been frought with labor difficulty and
staggering losses before and since Lorenzo took over.
   For Icahn, a well-known takeover strategist who has chased
mammoth-sized companies ranging from USX Corp. to Texaco Inc. in
the past few years, the acquisition of Eastern would make his the
largest U.S. airline in terms of revenue passenger miles, an
industry measurement of capacity.
   According to figures of the Air Transport Association, a
Washington trade group, Eastern and TWA's combined capacity last
year totaled 68.9 billion revenue passenger miles. The leading U.S.
airline last year in capacity was United, with 66.2 billion revenue
passenger miles.
   Eastern's militant workers, who have persistently characterized
Lorenzo as a union buster, have been included in talks with Icahn
on the possible sale of the airline to him, sources familiar with
the situation said Thursday.
   In an ironic twist, that recalls the move by TWA's workers in
1985 to talk with Icahn about possibly buying that airline, which
Lorenzo was seeking in order to strengthen the operations of his
other carrier, Continental.
   At that time, TWA's pilots and machinists promised Icahn
hundreds of millions of dollars in labor concessions if he took
control, largely because they feared Lorenzo would gut TWA and
replace them with lower-paid workers, a strategy Lorenzo had used
at Continental earlier.
   After a seesaw struggle that lasted for several months, Icahn
acquired a controlling stake in TWA as part of a broader
arrangement to eventually take the airline private, which is
expected to be completed soon. Lorenzo's Texas Air got about $50
million for selling its interest in TWA to Icahn.
   Since the TWA takeover, Icahn has faced his own labor problems,
beginning with a bitter strike by flight attendants in 1986 that
left thousands out of work, replaced by new hires at lower pay.
   Although the strike failed, the flight attendants union has
continued to challenge Icahn and petitioned the Department of
Transportion to review his fitness to run the airline earlier this
year.
   More recently, Icahn has incurred the wrath of TWA's pilots, who
claim he broke promises to them when he initially acquired control
of the airline. The pilots have sued him on grounds he is borrowing
against the airline's properties without making crucial long-term
investments in equipment.
   ``The solvency of the airline is in question,'' TWA pilots union
chief Thomas Ashwood said in announcing the lawsuit last month.
   ``We won't stand idly by while Carl Icahn strips our airline of
assets and keeps it from growing financially stronger, from buying
airplanes and from improving service to our passengers because of
heavy debt.''
   Icahn has denied the charges of both unions, saying he was
``dismayed'' by their actions.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises in Quiet Trading; Gold Continues Advance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar moved narrowly higher Thursday as
traders awaited Friday's release of unemployment figures for
September.
   Gold prices also rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a late bid of $403.50 for a troy ounce of gold, up from $400.30
late Wednesday.
   Dollar trading was very quiet, but some investors adjusted their
positions in advance of the Labor Department's unemployment report,
said James T. McGroarty, a vice president at Discount Corp.
   Traders were waiting in particular to see what changes there
would be in non-farm payroll statistics to be issued with the
jobless report, McGroarty said.
   The market expected the non-farm payroll to have increased by
about 300,000 to 330,000 workers last month, analysts said.
   Robert Ryan, senior trader at Irving Trust Co., said the dollar
likely would slip if the payroll number fell short of expectations.
   Traders would interpret an increase in the non-farm payroll as a
sign of economic strength. Traders believe the Federal Reserve is
more likely to rein in credit _ moving interest rates higher _ when
the economy is robust.
   The dollar tends to rise along with interest rates.
   Once the unemployment report has been digested, the market will
look forward to next week's release of U.S. trade deficit figures,
Ryan said.
   Overseas trading in the dollar also was slow Thursday in
anticipation of Friday's jobless figures.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar slipped 0.18 yen to close at 133.30 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 133.45 yen and in New York, the dollar
rose to 133.645 yen from late Wednesday's 133.38.
   The dollar edged upward against the British pound. It cost
$1.6935 to buy one pound in London, cheaper than $1.6955 late
Wednesday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.6927, compared
with late Wednesday's $1.69385.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.86585 West German marks, up from
1.86475; 1.5847 Swiss francs, up from 1.5826; 6.3570 French francs,
up from 6.3440; 1,391.75 Italian lire, up from 1,3900.00; and
1.20995 Canadian dollars, up from 1.20945.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8641 West German marks, up from
1.8625; 1.5830 Swiss francs, down from 1.5865; 6.3475 French
francs, down from 6.3540; 2.1000 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1020;
1,388.75 Italian lire, down from 1,390.475; and 1.2116 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2075.
   Gold prices closed above $400 overseas, catching up to bullion's
performance in New York on Wednesday.
   Gold jumped in London to a late bid price of $403.35 a troy
ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $396.00, and it rose in
Zurich to a bid $403.90, compared with $395.40 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, bullion climbed $5.27 to close at a bid
$405.73.
   Gold continued to advance on the Commodity Exchange in New York,
closing at $403.80 a troy ounce, up from $400.80 on Wednesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.34 a troy ounce, compared
with Wednesday's $6.19.
   On the Commodity Exchange, silver closed at $6.288 a troy ounce,
down from $6.298 on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Deere-UAW Contract Includes Pay Raise, Job Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union workers at Deere & Co. reportedly
would get their first general pay increases since 1981, as well as
boosts in retirement benefits and greater job security under terms
of a tentative contract agreement.
   The contract proposal between Deere and the United Auto Workers
calls for an average pay raise of 44 cents per hour in the first
year of the proposed three-year contract, according to Thursday's
edition of the Journal Star of Peoria.
   Currently, the 13,500 UAW workers at Deere earn an average
$15.47 per hour, or $32,177 per year based on a 40-hour week.
   The newspaper, citing unidentified sources within the company
and the union, reported that Deere workers would receive bonuses of
approximately 3 percent, paid in lump sums, in each of the next two
years of the contract.
   Deere's union work force has not received a general pay raise
since 1981. It has given cost-of-living increases using a formula
tied to the consumer price index.
   Besides wage hikes, the union won a three-step increase in early
retirement benefits, the paper reported.
   In the contract's first year, the monthly pension benefit for
those on early retirement would jump from $1,205 to $1,400. The
monthly benefit would reach $1,500 in the second year and $1,600 in
the final year of the pact.
   The union also claimed significant gains in the contract's job
security plan. The proposed contract would guarantee jobs for all
workers employed at the time the pact is ratified.
   The company would only be able to lay off protected employees in
times of high inventories, labor disputes, plant closings, sale of
a division of the company or ``an act of God.''
   Ratification votes are scheduled this weekend at Deere factories
and parts warehouses in Illinois, Iowa, Atlanta, Minneapolis and
Denver.
   The tentative agreement capped a marathon 20-hour bargaining
session. Deere and the UAW negotiated daily for nearly two months
before the settlement was announced at 5:08 a.m. Saturday, more
than five hours after the current labor contract expired.
   The new contract would take effect immediately upon ratification
and would run through midnight Sept. 30, 1991.
   If the contract is ratified, Deere and the union will have
avoided a repeat of the bitter five-month strike in 1986-87 that
ended after 163 days with employees' acceptance of a wage freeze
and other concessions.
   The union hopes to rekindle contract negotiations with
Caterpillar Inc. immediately upon ratification of the Deere
contract. The UAW has been meeting with the Peoria-based
Caterpillar for two months at a site in Bridgeton, Mo., outside St.
Louis.

   Ashland Oil Inc. Thursday entered a not guilty
plea and asked for a jury trial on criminal negligence charges in
the Jan. 2 tank collapse that fouled two major rivers with diesel
fuel.
   A spokesman for the Kentucky-based company, which publicly
admitted errors that figured in the collapse, declined to say
whether Ashland attorneys are attempting to negotiate a bargain
with prosecutors.
   ``We're having conversations with the U.S. Attorney. We're still
interested in doing that,'' said Ashland spokesman Dan Lacy.
   A federal grand jury on Sept. 15 returned a two-count indictment
accusing Ashland of violating the Clean Water Act and the 1899
Refuse Act. Prosecutors say neither law requires the government to
prove the pollution was intentional.
   If convicted on both counts, Ashland could be fined $400,000
plus double the damage caused by the spill.
   The spill occurred when a steel tank at the company's Floreffe
terminal burst as it was being filled for the first time since the
World War II-era structure was dismantled near Cleveland and
reassembled south of Pittsburgh.
   An independent study blamed the collapse on a dime-size flaw
near one of the welds used in reassembling the tank.
   Besides failing to obtain all the necessary local permits to
erect the tank, Ashland admitted violating industry standards by
not filling the vessel with water to test its strength.
   Ashland Chairman John Hall said Jan. 27 that employees
responsible for moving the tank were told more than a year earlier
about faulty welds in the vessel walls. A memo describing the
faults wasn't uncovered by senior management until nearly three
weeks after the tank collapsed, he said.
   Ashland maintains it is unfairly being prosecuted.
   ``We've spent $13 million in reimbursements and cleanup costs,''
Lacy said. ``We don't feel that any of our conduct justifies a
criminal penalty.''
   An estimated 3.8 million gallons of oil gushed from the tank as
it crumpled. Most of the oil was contained by a dike, but an
estimated 715,000 gallons entered the Monongahela River and flowed
into the Ohio.
   Tap water service was discontinued to 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh
residents for a week after the spill, and water supplies for nearly
a million other residents in three states along the Ohio River was
threatened.

<HEAD>Mercedes Prices Heading Up Slightly For '89</HEAD>

   The formidable price tags on
1989 Mercedes-Benz automobiles will rise a modest 1.7 percent over
1988, and the company is testing a new used-car warranty program,
officials said Thursday.
   Prices for the West German-made luxury cars will range from
$30,980 for the 190 diesel sedan, to $79,840 for the two-door
560SEC.
   The best-selling car in the United States is the Ford Escort,
with a base price of about $7,500, less than a tenth of the
560SEC's sticker.
   Erich Krampe, president and chief executive officer of
Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., said he doesn't expect any
price fluctuations in 1989 because of the exchange rate between the
U.S. dollar and the West German mark.
   He said he was happy with the company's sales performance
despite slipping a little from last year's level of about 80,000
cars. He said during the past year, Mercedes had restructured
itself and it's paying off.
   The luxury car market, of which Mercedes holds a significant
share, will continue to grow, Krampe said, and competition in it
will increase as Toyota and Nissan introduce their Lexus and
Infiniti lines next year.
   ``The overall luxury market, there is a lot of steam in there,''
Krampe added.
   But along with holding its volume of new car sales about the
same level, Mercedes is looking at improving its used-car
operations through a pilot warranty program in 20 dealerships
nationwide.
   ``We want to test how it works on the dealer level, customers
and our own administration,'' Krampe said.
   For cars less than 8 years old and with less than 100,000 miles,
the program would offer a 12-month, bumper-to-bumper warranty. The
program started a few weeks ago and will be assessed in December,
Krampe said.
   Dealers would set the cost of the warranty.
   Officials said about 60 percent of the new Mercedes sold are
bought by former Mercedes owners. The cars retain 65 to 70 percent
of their original value in two years and 40 percent to 45 percent
after five years, they added.
   All of the new '89 Mercedes will be equipped with anti-lock
brake systems and driver-side air bags. Some cars will have
passenger-side air bags as standard equipment.
   The average new Mercedes buyer is 40 to 43 years old and comes
from a household with an income of about $100,000 annually, Krampe
said.

<HEAD>Vote For New Capsule Maker Board Members Upheld</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Delaware court has upheld a proxy vote electing
new R.P. Scherer Corp. board members backed by dissident
shareholders who want to sell the gelatin capsule company, Scherer
said Thursday.
   Scherer attorneys were reviewing the ruling received late
Wednesday, and had not decided whether to appeal, company
spokeswoman Jayne A. Colombo said.
   The decision was hailed by Karla Scherer Fink and John S.
Scherer, both children of the company's late founder and members of
the board of directors, who lead the shareholder group pressing for
the sale of the company.
   ``Yesterday's decision in Delaware is the latest in a series of
victories for R.P. Scherer stockholders, who now are several steps
closer than they were a week ago to maximizing their investments
through sale of the corporation,'' John Scherer said in a news
release.
   The Delaware Chancery Court ruling that upheld the contested
election of dissident-backed Theodore Souris to the board.
   Karla Fink and John Scherer control a total of about 38 percent
of the company's outstanding shares. Mrs. Fink's estranged husband,
Peter Fink, Scherer's president and chief executive officer, and
management have opposed a sale of the company.
   Souris was elected in the Aug. 17 proxy vote to replace Peter
Dow, who opposes a sale of the company, on the 11-member board.
   The company did not contest the re-election of Peter Fink, who
ran unopposed, or the election of dissident backed Frederick Frank
to replace board member Richard Manoogian.
   Even before the outcome of the chancery court case, 10 members
of the Scherer board had voted last Friday to hire Goldman, Sachs &
Co. to consider possible moves that could include the sale of the
company.

   The Environmental Protection Agency has failed
to act against tens of thousands of violations of the Safe Drinking
Water Act by local water systems, the National Wildlife Federation
said Thursday.
   ``There has been a major breakdown'' in administration of the
1974 law, said Jay Hair, executive vice president of the
federation, at a news conference.
   The federation, whose 5 million members make it the nation's
largest environmental organization, released a report of an
18-month examination of 15,000 pages of EPA computer printouts for
the 1987 fiscal year that showed 36,763 water systems committing
101,588 violations of the act. The nation has over 200,000 water
systems.
   Though the law requires that every violation be reported to
customers of the system, only 5,867 notices were issued. The
federation did not count failure to issue notices in its survey of
violations. If it had, they would have numbered 197,309.
   Of the violations, said Norman Dean, federation staff lawyer and
principal author of the report, 17,506 were violations of
enforceable contaminant standards and the rest were monitoring and
reporting violations which both he and the agency consider
potentially more serious.
   Monitoring and reporting requirements are ``the heart of the
law,'' the study said. ``They enable the identification and
correction of public health risks before they blossom into crises.''
   Seventy percent of the contaminant violations were for exceeding
bacteriological standards, 20 percent involved inorganic chemicals
or substances like metals or arsenic, 0.6 percent were organic
chemicals such as pesticides, 0.9 percent were radioactivity
violations, and 7.7 percent were turbidity _ sediment _ violations,
according to Dean's figures.
   ``There's no excuse for a public water system to be distributing
water that exceeds the bacteriological standards,'' said Dean,
since bacteria are easily killed by cheap, well-understood
chlorination.
   The law permits states to run drinking water protection programs
approved by EPA if their standards and procedures are as tough as
the federal standards. Only Indiana, Wyoming and the District of
Columbia have opted to leave EPA with direct authority in those
jurisdictions.
   Dean said a 1982 report on lax enforcement by the General
Accounting Office led Congress to remove enforcement discretion
from EPA in 1986, changing the statute to read that EPA ``shall''
take enforcement action against every violation if the state does
not do so in 30 days. Before, the law read that EPA ``may'' act.
   But what action is needed is left to EPA. The maximum penalty is
a fine of $25,000 a day for each violation, rarely imposed.
   Peter Cook, deputy director of EPA's Office of Drinking Water,
said, ``All regulatory agencies must have enforcement discretion.''
When EPA finds a violation, ``It is our position that it need not
be an enforcement action'' that follows.
   ``It's important to understand that if enforcement actions are
not taken, the states are aggressive in protecting the public
health'' through ``boil water'' announcements, requirements for
provision of bottled water and similar measures, Cook said.
   Small systems _ almost two-thirds of the total serve fewer than
500 people _ may have difficulty raising money, Cook said. ``It may
take some time for this community to float a loan'' to upgrade
treatment systems. ``You're talking about years. It doesn't make a
lot of sense, if you have a cooperative community which is moving
ahead, to beat them over the head with penalties that they can't
afford anyway.''
   Hair said ``there is no question discretion must be used,'' but
the agency must do something. ``For a first-time violator and a
minor violation,'' no fine would be appropriate, Dean said. ``A
simple compliance order and a public admonishment'' would suffice.
   ``We're not talking about calibrating the enforcement dial a
little bit,'' said Hair. ``We're talking about tens of thousands of
violations.''
   Hair said the federation made no attempt to assess health risks
to the public from the violations, but he and Dean noted that EPA
had estimated that 110,000 illnesses arose in the population
between 1971 and 1985 from waterborne disease, and some experts
believe there may actually have been 25 times as many cases.
   People worried about their water may get it tested by a private
lab, but a full rundown on organic and inorganic chemicals can cost
more than $200, ``more than the average person should be asked to
do,'' Hair said.
   EPA established a toll-free telephone number 15 months ago to
answer question about drinking water (800-426-4791,) and Jeremy
Rowland, the contractor operating it, said calls now run about 200
a day. About half come from local and state government agencies and
water systems seeking information and half from the general public.
   Of the public callers, he estimated three quarters were worried
about water quality and a quarter were people saying, ``We're
overregulated and our water bills are too high.''
   At the American Water Works Association, the trade association
of private and publicly operated water supply systems, deputy
executive director Jack Sullivan said he did not doubt the
federation's figures, and also did not doubt that many violations
that should have been punished were not.
   But Sullivan echoed Cook's comment that many systems were
financially strapped. ``We're going to have to say to some of these
smaller systems, `You're going to have to have financial
capability, or we're going to force you into a regional system,'''
something the state of Connecticut is doing, Sullivan said.

<HEAD>Pan Am Transport Workers Vote for Arbitration in Contract Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the largest union at Pan Am Corp.
have voted to submit their contract dispute with the financially
pressed airline to binding federal arbitration, union officials
said Thursday.
   In August, the Transport Workers membership rejected a new
cost-cutting contract that had been agreed to by its leadership and
Pan Am. The airline has already accepted arbitration in talks with
the Transport Workers.
   The union represents about 5,900 mechanics, aircraft service
personnel and flight dispatchers at New York-based Pan Am, the
nation's eighth-largest airline.
   Details of the vote weren't immediately available.
   In announcing the vote, Transport Workers officials said the
union will now sit down with Pan Am management to set up the ground
rules for the procedure and choose an arbitration panel.
   On Wednesday, Pan Am reached a tentative contract agreement with
leaders of its flight attendants union.
   Details of the new flight attendants' contract, which must be
ratified by the union's membership, were not disclosed. Pan Am said
in a statement that the contract provides for cost reductions
similar to those agreed on earlier this year with the two unions
representing pilots and flight engineers at the airline.
   The new agreement provides for labor concessions by the 4,500
flight attendants at Pan Am, according o a source close to the
negotiations. Pan Am has been seeking around $90 million in wage
reductions from its flight attendants.
   The ratification vote is expected to be completed in
mid-November.
   Pan Am, which lost $88.4 million in the first half of the year,
believes it needs about $540 million over three years in pay cuts
and other concessions to turn itself around. The contract with the
Transport Workers would have saved the airline about $81 million
over the next three years, according to both the union and Pan Am.
   The airline has imposed $35 million in cuts on employees
represented by the Teamsters union under federal labor rules. The
unions representing pilots and flight engineers agreed to cuts
totaling about $240 million over three years.

   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Co. said Thursday it will refund more than $157 million to
customers in 18 states and the District of Columbia because of
lower-than-projected claims in those areas.
   Customers will receive refund checks or premium credits over a
six-month period starting Nov. 15.
   State Farm said it has made similar refunds of auto insurance
premiums, returning more than $1 billion to customers since 1971.
   The size of each customer's refund will vary from state to
state. The percent of the semi-annual premium to be refunded, the
estimated total dollar amount that will be returned in each state
and the number of customers affected in that state are:

   The state Casino Control
Commission has rejected an attempt by Pratt Hotel Corp. to block
developer Donald Trump from bidding on a disputed piece of lan Division
of Gaming
Enforcement could take action if it wanted.
   At issue is land most recently controlled by Columbus Plaza
Associates, a partnership that declared bankruptcy more than a year
ago.
   Pratt, which owns the Sands Hotel & Casino, wants to acquire the
land for a parking garage to serve the proposed conversion of the
stalled Penthouse project into the Sands Hollywood Casino Hotel.
   Last month, Pratt bid $14 million for the property before a
federal bankruptcy court judge.
   Five days later, Trump bid $16 million for the same land.
   Pratt President William Weidner accused Trump of trying to block
the Sands project. Penthouse Ltd., supported by Pratt, asked the
commission to bar Trump from buying the land.
   Trump has opposed the Sands Hollywood project, saying that it
does not have sufficient on-site parking and that it would create
serious traffic problems in downtown Atlantic City. But he denies
trying to buy the land to block the rival's project.
   The DeMatteis Organization of New York has outbid both Pratt and
Trump for the property _ an $18 millon offer _ but needs a host of
state and city approvals.

<TEXT>
   Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., spurned
by the management of Delchamps Inc., has taken its $210 million
offer for the supermarket company directly to shareholders.
   Michael J. Rourke, A&P's vice president of communications, said
Wednesday A&P decided to begin a $30-per-share tender offer after
three unsuccessful attempts in three years to convince Delchamps
executives that a merger was in the best interest of shareholders.
   Delchamps stock closed at $27 a share, up $2.50, in
over-the-counter trading Wednesday.
   In 1987, A&P withdrew an offer of $27 per share just after the
stock market crash. In October 1986, it bid $23 and was turned down
by Delchamps management.
   Delchamps Chairman Alfred Delchamps has said his Mobile,
Ala.-based company prefers to remain independent.
   A&P wants to acquire the 101 Delchamps supermarkets in Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana and along the Florida Gulf coast to
strengthen its presence in the South.
   ``We are very thin in our store coverage of that region,''
Rourke said.
   A&P, with 1987 sales of $9.6 billion, currently operates 1,170
stores, including Waldbaum's, Kohl's, Food Emporium and Super Fresh
stores in the U.S. and Dominion food stores in Canada.
   Delchamps had annual sales of about $700 million last year.
   A&P's offer is contingent on the company acquiring a majority of
Delchamps stock and will expire Nov. 4, according to Rourke.

   Toyota Motor Corp. officially dedicated
its $800 million automobile plant Thursday amid praise of the
partnership between Kentucky and the Japanese automaker.
   ``This plant, a product of the close cooperation between
Kentucky and Toyota, will be the model for relations between our
countries,'' said Nobuo Matsunaga, Japan's ambassador to the United
states.
   The plant, which began production on July 11, is Toyota's first
wholly owned automobile manufacturing complex in the United States.
By the end of 1989, it is expected to be producing 200,000 Camrys
annually.
   Nearly 1,700 Toyota employees, government officials and
community leaders attended the ceremony inside the facility.
   ``Today's ceremony represents a new spirit, one of pioneering
new economic, cultural and manufacturing ideals,'' said Shoichiro
Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corp. ``A spirit of successfully
merging the manufacturing ideals and practices of two nations in
order to bring a new tradition of success.''
   Former Gov. Martha Layne Collins, who was instrumental in
bringing the automobile manufacturer to Kentucky three years ago,
was given a standing ovation following her comments.
   ``About three years ago, I opened by saying, `Toyota, Oh what a
feeling,''' said Collins. ``I believe we still have that feeling.''
   Toyota presented the city of Georgetown and Scott County with 10
Camrys.

<TEXT>
   Sixteen state employees filed a
federal suit on Thursday in an effort to block mandatory dues
payments to the United Auto Workers union, the National Right to
Work Legal Defense Foundation said.
   The class-action lawsuit seeks to remove the fee requirement for
22,000 state employees represented by UAW Local 6000, several
thousand of whom aren't union members.
   The employees contend the dues deductions will force them to
finance political campaigns, ideological causes and other
non-collective bargaining activities they oppose, the Springfield,
Va.-based foundation said in a statement released in Detroit.
   Beginning Oct. 13, non-members will be required to pay so-called
agency fees nearly equal to union dues, the statement said.
   ``This new `agency shop' scheme is nothing more than an attempt
by UAW officials to replenish their political coffers and advance
their agenda with the wages of state workers who want nothing to do
with that agenda,'' Rex H. Reed, the foundation's executive vice
president, said in a separate statement. ``And the state of
Michigan is a willing accomplice and must be held accountable.''
   Spokesman Reg McGhee said from UAW headquarters in Detroit that
a Grand Rapids attorney was reviewing the suit on the union's
behalf.
   ``But we haven't seen any paperwork back here,'' McGhee said.
``Until we see the actual charge, we have no comment at this time.''
   Besides the UAW and Local 6000, defendants include state
Treasurer Robert Bowman, Department of Public Health Director Raj
Wiener and personnel directors of state government agencies.

<HEAD>Report: Mexico To Protest OPEC Overproduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico plans to file an ``energetic protest''
with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over the
failure of some cartel members to stay within their production
quotas, according to a report here.
   The government oil monopoly Pemex on Tuesday blamed OPEC
overproduction for the glut on world markets that caused petroleum
prices to reach a two-year low this week.
   Oil prices also have been depressed by speculation that OPEC
overproduction would continue in the near-future, due to
disagreements among cartel members over output quotas.
   Mexico, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, does not belong
to OPEC but closely monitors the 13-member cartel's pricing and
production policies.
   The Excelsior news service on Thursday quoted an official with
the Energy, Mines and State-Owned Industries Department as saying
the government planned ``an energetic protest against OPEC members
for the lack of seriousness and responsibility in meeting their
fixed production platforms.''
   The department oversees Pemex's operations.
   Excelsior quoted the department official as saying Mexico had
lost $2 billion in anticipated revenue so far in 1988 because of
depressed market prices.
   A department spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
refused to confirm the Excelsior report but said the government
soon would decide what action, if any, it would take towards OPEC.
   Rogelio Sotomayor, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' Treasury
Committee, said Wednesday that Mexico would maintain its oil
exports at current levels to generate necessary revenue and avoid
government cuts in social spending.
   Citing OPEC overproduction, Mexico on Tuesday announced it had
cut the price of its light crude exports to Asia from $13.50 to
$11.80 a barrel.
   Mexico produces about 2.5 million barrels of crude a day and
exports 1.35 million barrels a day _ about half of that to the
United States, according to Pemex.
   First quarter oil exports accounted for $1.8 billion in revenue,
according to the National Statistics Institute. Crude exports
generated $7.9 billion in all of 1987.

<TEXT>
   A special committee of Hospital
Corporation of America's board of directors rejected on Thursday a
$3.3 billion leveraged buyout proposal from a management group led
by Chairman Thomas F. Frist.
   The committee decided the offer of $47 cash per share from the
group was not ``in the best interest of the HCA shareholders,''
according to an HCA news release.
   ``The committee reconfirmed that it has not made any decision to
sell the company,'' the statement said. ``The committee is prepared
to consider any proposal which management or others may choose to
make.''
   Frist, an unnamed group of HCA managers and ``certain third
parties'' offered to buy the company's 70.6 million outstanding
shares in mid-September.
   In a leveraged buyout, an purchaser uses mostly borrowed money
to buy a company and repays it through cash flow or asset sales.
   HCA stock rose $1.62{ to $43.75 a share Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   HCA, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide,
making it one of the world's biggest hospital chains, established
the special committee to review the proposal.
   The committee said the decision to reject the proposal from
Frist's group was made on the advice of its independent financial
advisor, Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
   The company reported in July that its profits for the quarter
ending June 30 increased by 15 percent, partly because of increased
inpatient and outpatient revenue.
   HCA sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over one year
ago to a new employee-owned company, HealthTrust Inc.
   Frist was unavailable for comment Thursday, and HCA spokesman
David McFadden would not comment on the committee's action.

<HEAD>Cooper Cos. Agrees To Sell Eye Surgery Business To Nestle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cooper Cos. Inc. has agreed to sell its
eye surgery business for $325 million to a subsidiary of Swiss
conglomerate Nestle SA, the company said Thursday.
   Cooper signed a letter of intent with Alcon Laboratories Inc.
for the sale of its Irvine, Calif. unit, Cooper Surgical, which
sells some $300 million in eye surgery equipment each year, said
company spokesman Gene Elsbree.
   Cooper Surgical is an operating unit of Palo Alto-based Cooper
Cos., and formerly was part of Coopervision, Cooper's eye care
subsidiary.
   ``Alcon is a major company in the vision industry, and
Coopervision has had a long relationship with the company,''
Elsbree said.
   In 1984, Nestle attempted to buy Coopervision, but the Federal
Trade Commission blocked the deal.
   Cooper Cos., a health care products concern, has cut operations
and intends to sell off all of its businesses. The company, which
has outstanding debt of about $700 million, has been selling off
businesses since it announced plans to liquidate last May.
   Earlier this year, Cooper sold Coopervision's U.S. contact lens
solutions business to Wesley-Jessen, a Chicago subsidiary of
Schering-Plough Corp., for $40 million. It also sold the
international segment of that business to Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss drug
company, for $50 million.
   Elsbree said Cooper is discussing the sale of its $500 million
medical diagnostic subsidiary, Cooper Technicon, the Coopervision
worldwide contact lens business, and a small plastic and
reconstructive surgery products unit.

<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. is closing up to
10 offices nationwide due to slow business, the company said
Thursday.
   ``I've only been told of ten and they are not definite yet,''
said Fred Yager, a spokesman for the giant brokerage firm, said in
a telephone interview from Merrill's New York headquarters.
   If there are closures, they will not occur all at once, and will
only be smaller satellite offices, he said. Other than the Yakima
office, Yager declined to identify other offices that might shut
down.
   He said the October stock market crash was not the cause of the
closings, although the current market was ``soft.''
   Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, has about
500 U.S. offices, and the opening, closing or consolidation of
offices is not rare, Yager said.
   The closing of the Yakima office, which is expected ``sometime
before April,'' had not been disclosed officially yet to employees
or customers, Yager said.
   The business of the office in this central Washington city will
be consolidated into other offices in the state, Yager said.
   The fate of the approximately 20 employees of the Yakima office
is undecided. Yager said the 10 or 11 brokers will likely be
relocated, except for those who are not producing income for the
company. He did not say how many that could be.

<HEAD>AI Solicits Reorganization Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. is calling on its
investors to submit by Monday any plans they may have for
reorganizing the financially troubled consumer products company.
   Among those interested in controlling the company is Victor
Kiam, president and chief executive of the shaver manufacturer
Remington Products Inc. Kiam, who has a stake in the company, is
reviewing confidential financial information, Allegheny
International said.
   Management said it also held talks with Los Angeles
multimillionaire David H. Murdock, who first offered more than two
years ago to take over the company.
   Allegheny International has been operating under protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code since
February. The company's management is willing to step aside if
required under an acceptable reorganization plan, although a
successful plan might keep the current management in place, said
company spokesman Edward M. Romonoff.
   A stockholders plan filed within the last week calls for
stockholders to keep 50 percent of the reorganized company and to
receive rights to buy another 30 percent for $30 million. The plan
would give an outside investor, such as Kiam, rights to the rest of
the company for $20 million. The management team under Chairman
Oliver S. Travers Jr. would be replaced.
   The shareholders' plan would pay creditors between 50 percent
and full value for their claims.
   Management's reorganization plan has been criticized by every
major creditor group. It calls for bankers and creditors of
Allegheny's Sunbeam Corp. subsidiary to be repaid in full, while
other creditors would get 60 cents to 85 cents on the dollar, and
shareholders interests would be diluted by 75 percent.
   Allegheny management has the exclusive right to submit a
reorganization plan through Oct. 27, although U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Joseph L. Cosetti last month said he would accept plan outlines
from committess representing shareholders, unsecured creditors and
Sunbeam's creditors.
   Meanwhile, Allegheny International sent letters to four former
officers, including former Chairman Robert J. Buckley, calling in
low-interest loans of more than $4.3 million made to them in the
early 1980s. The company said the loans would be due in full Oct.
22 unless the men begin making payments.
   All four claim in separate complaints filed with the court that
they should not have to repay the money until Allegheny
International restores benefits taken away by the board in March
1987.

   The Senate on Thursday seized one of the most
popular issues of the presidential campaign and, on a 94-0 vote,
approved a tax exemption for interest on U.S. savings bonds that
are used to finance a college education.
   Wading into two even bigger issues _ taxes and drugs _ the
Senate for the time being refused to raise taxes on cigarettes and
alcohol to help pay for a $2.6 billion bipartisan anti-drug bill.
   A 60-33 vote killed the amendment by Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H.,
that would have raised the 16-cent cigarette tax by two cents and
added five cents to the price of a six-pack of beer or bottle of
wine and 30 cents to a fifth of liquor.
   The amendment is likely to come up again next week when the
Senate considers the big drug measure itself.
   ``I know the president of my party and the presidential nominee
of my party are against new taxes, and I am pretty much against new
taxes,'' said Rudman. ``But are we going to let this problem get
away from us?''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., manager of the tax bill, said the
entire bill would have been killed if Rudman's amendment had been
adopted. ``The White House believes this is not the way to raise
money to fight the war on drugs,'' he said.
   The lawmakers made quick work of another hot question, killing
on a 56-39 vote an effort by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., that
would have repealed tax exemptions of abortion clinics.
   The action came as the Senate worked on a bill whose main
purpose is to correct errors and misunderstandings in the 1986 tax
overhaul.
   The measure also includes some tax breaks worth about $2.7
billion over three years and the tax increases to pay for them. A
larger bill, with a $7.5 billion price tag, has been approved by
the House, and there is no assurance a compromise can be agreed on
by both chambers before adjournment.
   The Senate bill has benefits for farmers and other off-road
users of diesel fuel, first-time homebuyers, corporate research
efforts and workers who receive educational or legal assistance
from employers. The measure includes a ``bill of rights'' for
taxpayers involved in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee, offered the savings-bond amendment.
He introduced it last year and President Reagan included it in his
budget earlier this year.
   Kennedy described his savings-bond proposal, which is not in the
House bill, as ``a simple, sensible way ram.''
   Under the provision, the interest on any savings bond used to
pay for costs of a college or vocational education would be
tax-exempt. All savings bonds already are tax-deferred until
redeemed; in addition, they are exempt from state and local taxes.
   Thr would simply not report that interest as taxable income.
   The full exemption from federal tax would be available to
familieswhose adjusted gross incomes are under $60,000 a year. The
benefit would be reduced gradually as income rises: between $60,000
and $70,000, 67 percent of the interest would be exempt; between
$70,000 and $79,999, 34 percent would be exempt. Once income
reaches $80,000, no bond interest would be allowed.
   Those figures would be adjusted each year to reflect inflation.
   The education benefit would be paid for by limiting the personal
tax exemption allowed full-time students 24 years or older who are
still claimed as dependents by their parents. Under Kennedy's
proposal, the parents could take the exemption only if they provide
at least half the support of the student and the student has income
of less than $1,950.
   Kennedy's proposal is similar to one advocated by Vice President
George Bush, the Republican nominee for president.
   The Democratic candidate, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts,
has offered a new loan program that students would pay back through
payroll deductions after they complete their education.
   Kennedy said his plan is simple, risk-free for investors, good
for the nation's savings rate and convenient. ``But ultimately, I
believe that the most important feature of this proposal is simply
that it sends a loud, clear message about our priorities,'' he said.
   Not voting on the savings bond interest exemption were Sens.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; David Karnes, R-Neb.;
Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; and Dan Quayle,

<HEAD>Interco Asks Appeals Court To Lift Stay on Litigation in Takeover
Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc. asked a federal appeals
court Thursday to order a judge to hear its claim that an investor
group was improperly pursuing a $2.66 billion takeover attempt.
   Interco maintains the hostile buyout attempt by a group led by
the Washington, D.C.-based Rales brothers violates Security and
Exchange Commission regulations by being too highly leveraged.
   U.S. Judge William Hungate has issued a stay barring litigation
in the case, making it impossible for Interco to seek a judgment in
the matter. Interco asked a three-judge panel of the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in an expedited appeal to order Hungate to
hear its claim.
   Interco, based in St. Louis, has rebuffed the group's overtures
since it first offered $64 a share in July. On Sept. 20, Interco
announced its board of directors had rejected a revised,
conditional $72-a-share offer and had instead adopted a major
restructuring and recapitalization program that might include the
sale of some of its major businesses.
   Interco chairman Harvey Saligman said the restructuring plan was
worth $76 a share.
   The company is a a diversified manufacturer of furniture and
apparel whose lines include Ethan Allen furniture, London Fog
outerwear and Florsheim shoes.
   Cardinal Acquisition, the group led by brothers Mitchell and
Stephen Rales, has acquired about 8 percent of Interco stock in a
tender offer that expires Oct. 11.
   The group is pursuing a leveraged buyout of Interco. In such a
deal, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are
repaid with money raised through the company's cash flow or by the
sale of its assets.
   Interco contends the amount of money Cardinal Acquisition would
have to borrow is greater than limits set by SEC.
   Cardinal Acquisition argued before the appeals court that the
matter should be settled in Delaware courts _ Interco is
incorporated in Delaware _ and noted a federal judge there had
refused to block the takeover attempt.
   Attorneys said every effort Interco has taken to block the
takeover until now had been taken in Delaware courts.
   Interco attorneys said Hungate had refused to hear the question
because there were other avenues open, but contended none of the
alternatives showed a likelihood for success in time and others
were unfeasible.
   Judge John Gibson said the appeals panel court would issue an
order ``as soon as we can.''
   The hearing was held in Kansas City because all judges of the
8th Circuit were here for to discuss internal court matters.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and Fiat Auto SpA of
Italy have formed a joint venture to market Alfa Romeo cars in
North America, Chrysler announced Thursday.
   The still-unnamed joint venture will import Alfa Romeo's three
car lines _ the Spider, Milano and 164 _ to North America from
Italy during the coming year, Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart
said.
   The cars will be offered through a limited network of what
eventually will be about 250 Chrysler-Plymouth and Alfa Romeo
dealerships, she said.
   The venture ``combines Fiat's recognized manufacturing,
production and design expertise with Chrysler's strong marketing
and distribution capabilities in the North American market,''
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said.
   ``We are confident our association with Chrysler will result in
increased market opportunities to help us to reach higher sales
volumes in North America,'' Fiat Group Chairman Giovanni Agnelli
said.
   Chrysler and Fiat will split the profits from the joint venture,
which Stewart said was to be legally executed within 60 days. She
would not disclose the amount of money either company is committing
to the project.
   Fiat bought Alfa Romeo less than two years ago.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 7th graf pvs, bgng: ``When LTV ...'' to CORRECT million

<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration on Thursday appealed
a federal judge's ruling that the government could not force ailing
LTV Corp. to reassume some $3 billion in pension obligations.
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the government agency which
insures pensions for some 40 million workers, filed the appeal with
the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York.
   The appeal seeks to overturn ``as a dangerous precedent'' a
ruling last June by U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet of New York
that the PBGC could not make LTV reassume the pension obligations
simply because LTV had signed new contracts restoring previously
cut health and welfare benefits.
   ``The appeals court must decide whether federal insurance should
protect retirees or provide corporate welfare to profitable
companies,'' said Kathleen P. Utgoff, the agency's executive
director.
   LTV terminated three pension plans covering some 100,000 workers
and retirees of its steel subsidiary after the company filed for
bankruptcy reorganization in 1986, listing some $6 billion in
liabilities.
   The biggest of the liabilities _ $3 billion _ were the pension
plans, which then had assets of just $1 billion to cover benefits
for some 100,000 LTV workers and retirees.
   When LTV terminated the pension plans, the federal agency became
LTV's single biggest creditor, assuming responsibility for the $2
billion in uncovered pension liabilities.
   However, the agency does not insure related health and welfare
retirement benefits promised by LTV to its workers.
   When LTV signed new contracts with the United Steel Workers and
United Mine Workers unions restoring those benefits last year, the
agency tried to turn the pension plans back over to the company,
saying LTV was taking unfair advantage of the federal insurance
program to cut costs and buy labor peace.
   Sweet ruled that the PBGC had shown ``no factual or legal
basis'' that the company had abused the pension insurance program,
but said he was willing to reconsider the issue with some
additional ``fact finding'' by the agency.
   PBGC officials in Washington said Thursday that the agency chose
to appeal Sweet's ruling to a higher court rather than seek a new
hearing based on the additional fact finding.
