   Mexico.
   ``George Bush may try to run away from his running mate, but he
really can't hide,'' said Bentsen, who called the selection of
Quayle ``a big mistake.''
   ``While the Republicans are running from the issues, and running
from Dan Quayle, we don't intend to let them change the tune; we're
going to see that they face the music,'' Bentsen said.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has been facing
the music in Texas on the issues of crime and gun control in a
barrage of Republican ads portraying him as a coddler of criminals
who wants to disarm honest citizens. Bentsen attacked what he said
were distortions of Dukakis' record, and said Texas would see
through them.
   ``Texans won't buy a bill of goods on gun control from a man who
wanted to sell Hawk missiles to the ayatollah,'' he said.
   Bentsen denied Republican assertions that the Democrats had
given up on*wnnning the South.
   ``That is obviously not true. It sounds like some of his
comments during the debate. Not true at all,'' he said.
   ``I was in North Carolina the other day and they tell me we're
ahead there. I was in Tennessee, they said that's a dead heat. I
think we're ahead in Arkansas. We've seen a nice improvement here
in Texas (where) the momentum is back in our direction,'' he said,
citing a recent poll showing the ticket only five points behind.
   Bentsen also discussed his relationship with the late President
John F. Kennedy, which some have questioned since Bentsen said that
they were friends. He said that during the debate just before
telling Quayle he was ``no Jack Kennedy.''
   Bentsen, who served in the House with Kennedy, said he was the
Massachusetts senator's finance chairman in Houston when Kennedy
ran for presid`.w. He also said he received from Kennedy an
inscribed copy of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ``Profiles in
Courage.''
   Kennedy invited him to his wedding, Bentsen said, but he was
already scheduled to make a speech in south Texas and missed it.
   ``If I had knor.#he was going to be president, I'd have gone,''
he said.

<HEAD>Democrats Vow To Resume Battle For Family Issues In 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Sen. Edward Kennedy's son was undergoing
cancer treatment, the senator was absent from the Capitol for three
days every three weeks for two years. He didn't lose his job.
   When Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., had surgery that laid him up for
months, he didn't lose his job either.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., used those examples to underscore why
Democrats will be back next year pressing for a parental and
medical leave bill that died Friday along with a major child care
initiative.
   ``These two items will be top priorities in the next Senate,''
Kennedy said.
   Backers of the two family bills failed Friday to get the 60
votes they needed to limit debate and complete action on the
measure. The vote was 50-46.
   The package, which also included a crackdown on child
pornographers, was on the floor for the better part of two weeks
amid intense political and parliamentary maneuvering.
   Supporters found some solace in the heightened visibility of
their causes.
   ``It was an extraordinarily wonderful job of educating both
members of the Congress and the American public,'' said Judith
Lichtman, executive director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., sponsor of the child care and
parental leave bills, said he would re-introduce them on the first
day of the 101st Congress in January.
   Accusing Republicans of waging ``a filibuster by silence,'' he
declared, ``The stonewall prevailed. They defeated the American
family. But we're not going to lose forever. We're going to win
these issues.''
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., sponsor of the parental leave bill
in the House, said the Senate vote marked the beginning of the
fight and predicted supporters would have renewed strength next
year.
   ``The Senate's got to learn that you can't keep playing'' with
family issues, she said. ``People are going to be angry that
there's been such a high level of rhetoric and so little produced.''
   But the groups who fended off the parental-leave and child-care
provisions this year vowed to be back in force next year as well.
   ``This was round one, but it was very much indicative what the
proponents of (child care) and parental leave will face in the
future. They're going to face a battle again and again, not only
from the business community but from groups like ours,'' said
Elizabeth Kepley, a lobbyist for Concerned Women for America.
   She said the conservative group's nearly half-million members
are active in every congressional district in the nation.
   The three elements of the family package included:
   _Dodd's original bill requiring employers of more than 50 people
to offer workers at least 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave
when they have newborn, newly adopted or sick children, or have
serious medical problems themselves.
   _An anti-pornography initiative sponsored by Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., which creates new crimes and punishments for
those who possess, sell or distribute child pornography or obscene
materials. It was added to the parental leave bill on a unanimous
vote.
   _The $2.5 billion Act for Better Child Care Services, also
sponsored by Dodd, aimed at helping low-income parents pay for
child care at centers or homes. It was presented as a compromise
between Dodd and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and was to have included
a tax credit for poor families in its final form.
   Republicans maintained Congress had more pressing matters to
deal with, such as drug and tax bills, and refused to offer
amendments or strike a compromise on the family bills.
   ``What we've done in effect is say slow down,'' said Republican
leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``This isn't an urgent measure that
needs to be passed in the waning days of the 100th Congress.''

   Educators addressing the nation's top
business leaders say both presidential candidates have failed to
fulfill their promises to make education a priority of their
campaigns.
   Republican George Bush has said he wants to be known as ``the
education president'' and Democrat Michael Dukakis has said ``no
issue ... means more to me.''
   However, over the past year there's been ``a strange silence,''
said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching. ``A few little pieces have come along,
revolving mainly around college loans and grants, but I have not
seen a coherent program from either candidate.''
   ``I am disappointed with the lack of a sense of urgency,'' said
Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund,
which takes a liberal approach to family issues.
   ``Never have we heard so much discussion. But the proof of the
pudding is in the concrete proposals, the willingness to invest,''
she said.
   Boyer, Edelman and other education leaders spoke Friday during
private sessions of the Business Council, composed of 62 chief
executives of the country's biggest companies. They talked with
reporters afterward.
   The executives were gathered for their twice-a-year meeting in
this resort town in the mountains of western Virginia.
   Albert Shanker, president of the 665,000-member American
Federation of Teachers, said he agreed that neither candidate had a
well-developed education program, but he said he preferred Dukakis
to Bush because the Republican tilts toward providing federal
assistance to private schools.
   ``For us that's a life and death difference. If you move away
from the public schools ... that's abandoning the major institution
we have in our society for improvement of education,'' he said.
   However, former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, who ran
unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination, said
Bush should more strongly emphasize using free market competition
to improve education.
   ``The school system is terrified of (competition). They have a
government monopoly. They don't have to compete for their kids. Why
would they want to change? The problem is, of course, they're
giving everyone a lousy education,'' he said.
   Both Boyer and Edelman said they were encouraged that business
leaders recognized education's importance to the future of the
country.
   ``They are voices that are listened to (by politicians). They're
not going to listen to a third grade teacher. They are going to
listen to the president of a major corporation. Even the president
of the United States will answer a phone call from the people in
this conference,'' Boyer said.
   Also scheduled to speak to the business executives finishing a
two-day conference today were Paul Volcker, a forme chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board; Commerce Secretary C. William Verity; Sen.
Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., and Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., the chairmen
of the congressional budget committees, and Drew Lewis and Robert
S. Strauss, the co-chairmen of a blue-ribbon commission studying
the budget deficit.
   The council, formed in 1933 as an advisory panel to the
Department of Commerce, selected Roger B. Smith, chairman of
General Motors Corp., to serve as its chairman in 1989 and 1990. He
replaces S.D. Bechtel Jr., chairman of Bechtel Group Inc., a
worldwide construction firm.

<TEXT>
   The government on Friday declared the
campaign season open for general elections to be held May 7 of next
year and said the ballot will not be affected by strained
diplomatic relations with the United States.
   A president and two vice presidents will be elected by simple
majority of votes in May, to serve five-year terms beginning June 7.
   Elections for the legislative National Assembly and local
offices will be held June 4.
   The Electoral Tribunal said in a communique the campaign
schedule will be respected despite Panama's political and economic
crises.
   The United States has imposed economic sanctions and diplomatic
pressure on Panama trying to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
resign as the Defense Forces commander and as such, Panama's de
facto ruler.
   Noriega is under U.S. indictment on drug trafficking and money
laundering charges, which he denies. When President Eric Arturo
Delvalle tried to fire Noriega last February, Delvalle himself was
dismissed by the Noriega-controlled National Assembly.
   The Reagan administration still recognizes Delvalle as Panama's
legitimate president. U.S. economic sanctions have helped push
Panama's economy into its worst depression since the 1930s.
   Under election code changes approved by the assembly in August,
mayoral elections were eliminated in 68 towns and cities. Beginning
in 1989, the president will appoint mayors.
   The changes also require public office-holders who are
presidential candidates to resign three months before the election.
   Noriega has given no indication whether he plans to resign as
Defense Forces commander and run for president as standard-bearer
of the governing Democratic Revolutionary Party.
   Since a military coup in 1968, the presidency has been a
ceremonial post dominated by the armed forces. Nicolas Ardito
Barletta ran as the government candidate and won the presidential
election in 1984, the first in 16 years. He resigned under pressure
in 1985 over differences with the Defense Forces.
   With the military's support, Delvalle succeeded Barletta.
   The opposition has not yet said whether it will take part in the
election.
   Legally registered opposition parties include the Authentic
Panamanian Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Liberal
Republican Movement, the Labor Party, the Republican Party and the
National Action Party.
   More than 1.1 million Panamanians are registered to vote in May.
In the 1984 presidential elections, 917,000 voters were registered.

   A 24-year-old East German man
climbed his communist homeland's border barriers Friday and swam a
river to flee to the West, border police said.
   The man, whose identity was not released, eluded East German
police border patrols at the frontier nearly 50 east of Hamburg,
scaled barriers and then swam the Wakenitz River, said the West
German border police.
   On Thursday, police said two East German men fled from the
Baltic coast in a rubber dinghy and were rescued in stormy seas in
Danish territorial waters by a Greek freighter.
   On Wednesday, an East German man waded through the shallows of
the Werra River and scaled barriers to escape just east of Kassel
in north-central West Germany.
   More than 333 East Germans have fled to West Germany this year,
according to government statistics.

   A trucker convicted of murdering the heir
to the Burnham & Morrill baked bean fortune was sentenced Friday to
30 years in prison during an emotional hearing in which the
victim's son urged the judge to be lenient.
   James H. Savage Sr., 53, of Gardiner, faced a minimum of 25
years in prison for the slaying of Charles Sumner Morrill III, who
was shot four times at his farm in North Baldwin on Nov. 7, 1987.
   Justice Paul Fritzsche called the incident ``a horrible
tragedy.''
   Savage had maintained that he acted in self-defense when
Morrill, 51, attacked him after Savage arrived at the farm to
discuss his recently ended 14-month affair with Morrill's wife,
Jessie.
   The prosecution had claimed that Savage, armed with a loaded
pistol, had intended to provoke Morrill.
   His voice cracking, Savage told the judge he had been used by
Mrs. Morrill. ``I gave up everything I had,'' he said.
   The victim's son, Charles Sumner Morrill IV, backed up Savage's
account, saying he had told the truth about his stepmother. ``He
was a pawn, just like my father was a pawn,'' Morrill said.
   Morrill urged the judge to impose the 25-year minimum prison
term. The prosecution sought 30 years.
   Morrill and Savage were members of a bluegrass band that had
broken up earlier last year.

   Heads of state and dignitaries from
around the world attended memorial services Friday for Bavarian
leader Franz Josef Strauss, one of West Germany's most dynamic and
colorful politicians.
   Strauss, 73, governor of Bavaria and chairman of the
conservative Christian Social Union party, died Monday in
Regensburg.
   He was an original founder of West Germany when its government
was formed in 1949, and his influence reached far beyond its
borders.
   Thousands of prominent politicians, dignitaries, industrialists,
and religious leaders attended memorial proceedings, including
former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, President Pieter
Botha of South Africa and Soviet Deputy Premier Ivan Silayev.
   Proceedings began with a Roman Catholic Mass in Munich's
Liebfrauendom Cathedral, followed by a state memorial service in
nearby Wittelsbacher Residence building and a funeral procession
through the city.
   Strauss' daughter and two sons and his sister attended. His wife
Marianne died in 1984 in a car accident.
   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor
Helmut Kohl delivered eulogies.
   At the Mass, Cardinal Friedrich Wetter, archbishop of Munich and
Friesin, read aloud a telegram from the Vatican, in which Pope John
Paul II praised Strauss as a ``great Christian statesman.''
   Strauss was to be buried Saturday alongside his wife in Rott am
Inn, a small Bavarian village near Rosenheim.

   A federal appeals court has agreed to
reconsider its decision ordering the nation's space agency to
release the audio tape recording of space shuttle astronauts
moments before they died in the 1986 Challenger disaster.
   The full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the government's
request for a rehearing of the case by all of its 11 members.
   The decision, contained in an Oct. 5 order made public Friday,
came two months after a split panel of three appellate judges ruled
the tapes of the Jan. 28, 1986, shuttle disaster should be made
public under the Freedom of Information Act.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has refused to
give up the tapes, contending their release would subject the
survivors of the seven astronauts to emotional stress when they are
played repeatedly on radio and television.
   Two members of the court's liberal wing, Spottswood Robinson III
and Harry Edwards, joined in the July 29 ruling that drew a
blistering dissent from Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, a member
of the court's 6-5 conservative majority.
   The brief order granting the petition for a rehearing en banc
stated only that a majority of the 11 judges had agreed to
reconsider the earlier decision.
   The order said a briefing schedule would be announced later.
   A NASA spokeswoman, Patricia M. Riep, praised the decision
Friday evening.

<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is broadening his campaign
stump speech to heap praise on besieged Republican vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle.
   During the latest in a series of campaign-style trips aimed at
helping George Bush keep the White House in Republican hands,
Reagan on several occasions Friday put Quayle's name in a favorable
light. This was in addition to the usual Reagan plaudits for Bush.
   The president departed from the text of a dinner speech to tell
his audience that ``someone I know and respect came through for us
and all Americans the other night.''
   ``I have to say, I wasn't surprised,'' Reagan said of Quayle's
performance in debate with Democratic rival Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``Sure, the Washington establishment was betting against him,
but I can tell you, the smart money was riding on a great senator
by the name of Dan Quayle,'' he added.
   ``I tell you, he got my vote. How about you?'' the president
asked, bringing applause from the audience.
   Reagan had seldom mentioned Quayle's name in recent campaign
outings, but White House officials were unwilling to talk about the
apparent change in strategy.
   The kind words for Quayle on Friday started the moment Reagan
left the White House in the morning en route to Detroit, when he
made mention of the Indiana senator while commenting on the latest
drop in unemployment figures.
   ``We've talked about the record 70 months of economic expansion,
but these figures tell the real story that people can understand,''
he said. ``And that's what George Bush and Dan Quayle stand for and
it's what the administration has worked out for the last eight
years.''
   Once he arrived in Detroit, the president continued the
pro-Quayle statements he had commenced Thursday in the wake of
criticism of the Indiana senator's performance in Wednesday's vice
presidential debate.
   Speaking to a luncheon of business executives in Macomb County,
Reagan said that ``one thing's even clearer to me after watching
the debate Wednesday night: the Bush-Quayle ticket will continue
the policies of peace and prosperity that have _ as Dan said _ made
this great nation `the envy of the world.'''
   Then, in his address to a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner,
Reagan repeated that refrain.
   The president had talked glowingly of Quayle in the days
immediately following the Republican National Convention in August,
tossing the senator's name prominently into a speech he made Aug.
24 in a joint appearance with Bush in Los Angeles.
   But Reagan in the past few weeks had not alluded to Quayle in
these stump speeches.

   The fire chief of this southeast Ohio
community says he's relieved that an underground coal fire was
extinguished before reaching any homes.
   ``We were lucky to get to it in its infancy,'' Fire Chief Tim
Baden said.
   Thought the eight-day fire threatened as many as 30 homes, none
in the town of 5,000 people was damaged.
   Baden said the blaze was extinguished Friday after firefighters
poured water and a synthetic foam into holes bored into the earth.
   The fire, which covered a 40-by-40-foot area, was discovered
Sept. 30 when children playing on a hillside poked sticks into the
ground and saw that the sticks were on fire when they pulled them
out.
   The fire, which extended downward four feet, burned refuse coal
that was believed to have come from an unmapped mine abandoned in
the 1920s.
   Baden said the fire entered a coal seam and could have burned
indefinitely had it not been extinguished so soon.

   The bird flew 3,000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean, apparently
swept off course by westerly gales while migrating to South America
for the winter, said Nick Riddiford, a warden at the Fair Isle Bird
Observatory.
   It was found recently on Fair Isle, midway between the islands
of Orkney and Shetland north of the Scottish mainland, he said.
   Another trans-Atlantic traveler, a northern oriole, arrived in
the southwest English county of Cornwall Tuesday and an American
robin has been spotted on the Isle of Wight, off the southern coast

   Much of Britain has been swept by high winds blowing in from the
Atlantic in recent days.

   ``There is no index of character so

once said.
   If U.S. presidential candidates were judged by that standard
alone, neither Republican George Bush nor Democrat Michael Dukakis
would have a chance of winning the election, in the view of speech
pathologist Lillian Glass.
   ``It's about time the candidates begin to work with
consultants,'' she said. ``They have to realize, we don't live in a
democracy in terms of appearance.'' Politicians often are judged by
how they look and sound, not by their policies, she said.
   Ms. Glass, 34, the author of ``Talk to Win: Six Steps to a
Successful Vocal Image,'' has been analyzing the voices of Bush and
Dukakis since the early stages of their campaigns.
   Prior to the Republican National Convention last July, Ms. Glass
said that Bush's high-pitched, nasal voice negated his strong
physical presence and made him appear ``wimpy.'' Dukakis, she said,
spoke in a monotone and was unemotional.
   ``An election can be lost solely on how you sound,'' Ms. Glass
said.
   Both candidates, however, demonstrated a vastly improved
speaking style during their first debate on Sept. 25, she said.
   ``Bush is not perfect ... but he's lost the wimp factor,'' Ms.
Glass said after the debate, noting his slower, more methodical
approach, lower-pitch and stronger inflection.
   The changes in the vice president, for the most part, are being
attributed to the coaching of Roger Ailes, a former New York
television producer who serves as the campaign's senior media
advisor in Washington.
   Ailes denied molding Bush's image. He said any changes are in
the eyes of the public.
   ``People are starting to view him as a president and not as
(President) Reagan's assistant,'' he said. ``I mean the man is the
vice president of the United States. You don't get there because
three months ago you decided to do something about your voice.''
   Dukakis has a lot of potential as an orator but has not yet
mastered a presidential style, Ms. Glass said.
   ``He didn't go up as much at the end of sentences like he used
to,'' she said after the Sept. 25 debate. ``He had better diction
and less staccato in his voice.''
   As for the diction of the vice presidential candidates, there is
no comparison, said Ms. Glass.
   ``Dukakis' best asset is Lloyd Bentsen,'' she said. ``He blows
everybody away with his beautiful projection, posture and good
inflection. His security and warmth come across.''
   The Texas senator has a take-charge persona that Dukakis can
learn from, Ms. Glass said.
   Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, on the other hand, comes across
unsophisticated and ``twice as wimpy'' as Bush ever did, the speech
therapist said.
   ``He's a good-looking man with a high, nasal voice and that
doesn't reflect a lot of self-confidence.''
   ``Bush looks like a star and is beginning to sound more like a
star,'' she said. ``If he had a star running mate, it would
certainly help the ticket be more powerful.''
   Ms. Glass said all the candidates should use Reagan as a role
model.
   ``Whether you agree with his politics or not, you feel his
compassion and dedication to the country,'' she said. ``He has a
very calming effect.''
   What makes Reagan so good?
   ``His excellent posture, his body movement, how he uses the
camera,'' Ms. Glass said. ``It's his friend. When he's angry, you
see it. When he's up, it's reflected in his voice.''

   West Germany has confidential
agreements with its NATO allies on ways to protect nuclear weapons
from terrorist attacks or theft, an Interior Ministry spokesman
says.
   But the spokesman, Roland Bachmeier, refused to confirm reports
that members of a special U.S. anti-terrorist team were stationed
in West Germany.
   ``I am not prepared to discuss details,'' Bachmeier told
reporters Friday at a press conference.
   He said plans to protect nuclear weapons against terrorist
attempts to seize them were part of ``secret agreements.''
   Reports of the presence of the special team, called the Nuclear
Emergency Search Team, surfaced during recent government hearings
on a scandal-plagued nuclear waste transport company.
   Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, who chairs the parliamentary
investigative committee, said that the panel had come across
indications of the team's presence in West Germany ``by pure
chance'' as it sifted through documents.
   No other details were released.

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper,
La Prensa, published a government notice in its Friday editions
that condemned what it called the newspaper's ``defamatory''
reporting of the shootings of three labor activists.
   The Interior Ministry notice criticized a La Prensa editorial
Thursday that accompanied the texts of two government protests of
the newspaper's reporting of the Sunday shootings. La Prensa
printed the protests under government order.
   Friday's notice, was an ``admonition.'' Under a new emergency
law approved by the National Assembly on Wednesday, the president
can shut down print and broadcast media for ``the maintenance of
public order,'' but La Prensa was not ordered to close.
   The ministry notice said La Prensa ``insists in its defamatory
campaign of portraying the government of Nicaragua as responsible
for criminal events.'' It accused La Prensa of depicting the
government as generating ``a climate of threats against all persons
and organizations that say something against the Sandinista party.''
   In its Thursday editorial titled, ``An unjust order without
right and without reason,'' La Prensa said the government protests
were ``two precipitous documents ... that, lamentably, once again
incorrectly cite the country's laws and once again display an
ignorance of the legal norms that apply to the exercise of freedom
of expression in Nicaragua.''
   La Prensa also said that ``it is obvious that in recent days,
gangs of uniformed men with weapons only the army has have
committed brutal crimes that, inevitably, show common or similar
elements.''
   On Tuesday, La Prensa reported three activists with the
Confederation of Trade Union Unity were fatally shot Sunday by
three men wearing Sandinista army uniforms in Leon, about 45 miles
west of Managua. The report said the assailants used Soviet-made
AK-47 rifles, standard issue in the Sandinista army.
   La Prensa identified the slain activists as Fernando Torres,
Alejandro Peralta and Norberto Espinoza. It attributed its
information to Alvin Guthrie Rivers, secretary-general of the
anti-government confederation.
   On Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said Espinoza was a
Sandinista army first lieutenant and that Torres was a former
member of the Sandinista Police. It described Sunday's episode as a
common crime.

   Once the world's largest untapped source of
television viewers, China now boasts nearly 60 percent viewership
among its 1.08 billion people.
   National radio and television officials reported at a seminar
this week in Beijing that 600 million Chinese watch television
daily, the official China Daily said today.
   China now has 116 million television sets, 37 times more than a
decade ago, with an average of one set for every 10 people.
   The national and international news program broadcast by China
Central Television Station now reaches 42 percent of the population
each evening, the paper said.
   The country's 118 television assembly lines have a combined
annual production of 15 million. But demand for televisions,
particularly color sets, far outstrips supply, Xinhua said. Figures
were not available for the number of sets imported annually, but
Japanese brands are very popular.

<HEAD>Congress Expected To Act On Sludge-Dumping Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is expected to vote next week on
compromise legislation to ban disposal of sewage sludge in the
ocean by the nation's only remaining ocean dumpers.
   The new agreement, struck Friday by House and Senate conferees,
sets a Dec. 31, 1991, deadline for dumping in the Atlantic by nine
authorities in New York and New Jersey.
   The legislation imposes stiff fines aimed at making the dumping
exorbitantly expensive, and pools the fines to pay for alternatives.
   ``The agreement is tough but fair. Clearly the end of ocean
dumping is in sight,'' said Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., the prime
House sponsor.
   ``This bill is a major step in cleaning up our oceans,'' added
Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J.
   The compromise reconciles differing sludge-dumping bills passed
by the Senate in August and by the House earlier this week.
   Senate and House votes on the compromise are expected Wednesday.
President Reagan is expected to sign the bill.
   Some 8 million tons of sludge a year are dumped by the nine
agencies at a site about 106 miles east of New Jersey. Congress
closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987.
   Experts differ on the environmental threat posed by the dumping
of sludge.
   The new bill requires dumpers to pay fees of $100 per ton of
sludge beginning on Jan. 1 of next year.
   Any authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by 1993 would
have to pay penalties in addition to the fees.

<HEAD>Dukakis Strikes Theme of Economic Nationalism</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top prospects uncertain.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is hammering the Republicans on a
theme of economic nationalism, saying George Bush hung a ``do not
disturb sign'' on his door while foreign competitors and investors
battered and bought U.S. industries.
   The Democratic presidential nominee was campaigning back in his
native New England today, visiting Bates College in Lewiston,
Maine, on a sentimental stop at the place where his parents
attended college only a few years after emigrating from Greece.
   The trip to Maine, capping a campaign week highlighted by his
running mate Lloyd Bentsen's debate with Dan Quayle, was bringing
Dukakis to a small state but one the campaign hopes to carry on
Nov. 8 _ despite Bush's summer mansion on the coast at
Kennebunkport.
   ``We want to carry all of George Bush's home states,'' quipped
press secretary Dayton Duncan in a remark lampooning the vice
president's loose ties to several states.
   The Massachusetts governor returned to Boston late Friday after
campaigning in Missouri and North Carolina, assailing the Reagan
administration's record on foreign trade and Quayle's debate remark
praising foreign investment in U.S. companies for creating jobs.
   But the campaign was embarrassed to learn that the Moog
Automotive Co. in Wellston, Mo., where Dukakis delivered a speech
blasting the Republicans on the foreign investment issue, was
actually owned by an Italian auto-making conglomerate through a
U.S. holding company. And the company was bought out 11 years ago,
during a Democratic administration.
   Duncan said some in the campaign knew of its ownership, but top
campaign officials did not know and neither did Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., who accompanied Dukakis to the plant. Dukakis's
blasts at foreign ownership set off murmers among workers at the
plant, and aides acknowledged Dukakis was unaware of the ownership
when he praised the company and its workers as ``survivors'' in the
fight for American businesses and products.
   ``If anyone asks you what's at stake in this election, just
remind them of that moment in the debate Wednesday night when Dan
Quayle said he's happy that foreign owners are buying up America,''
Dukakis said.
   ``Maybe the Republican ticket wants our children to work for
foreign owners, pay rent to foreign owners, and owe their future to
foreign owners, but that's not the kind of future Lloyd Bentsen and
I and Dick Gephardt and all of you want for America,'' he said.
   Dukakis said Bush ``has spent the last eight years with a `do
not disturb' sign hanging on his office door,'' ignoring the trade
issue.
   He said the United States enjoyed a trade surplus of $7 billion
in 1981, when the Reagan administration took over, and that by 1987
the nation suffered a trade deficit of $154 billion.
   In the debate, Quayle said: ``I would rather have people come
over here and to make investments in this country, rather than
going elsewhere. Because by coming over here, and making
investments in this country, we are seeing jobs.''
   Dukakis borrowed some of the rhetoric of former rivals Gephardt
and Jesse Jackson from the Democratic primaries as he lamented the
decline of the United States as the leading manufacturer of
consumer electronics such as color televisons, video cassette
recorders and telephones.
   Dukakis and Bentsen are calling for a new trade policy that they
say will require reciprocity, or prohibiting foreign companies from
flooding the United States with products when U.S. manufacturers
are locked out of those countries. They also support limited
restrictions on imports of some foreign products, including
textiles, so long as U.S. companies respond by modernizing to
become competitive.
   Before heading home, Dukakis stopped in Ashville, N.C., and
spoke to a crowd of 2,000 people jammed around the home of the late
author Thomas Wolfe. Now restored, the two-story white frame house
with stained glass windows, which was Wolfe's mother's boarding
house that he recalled in the book ``Look Homeward Angel,'' served
as Dukakis' backdrop and he recalled traveling to North Carolina in
1960, fresh out of law school, just to visit the house.
   Dukakis cited a Wolfe quotation that approximated the
candidate's own often-repeated theme _ that ``the best America is
yet to come'' _ and declared the two debates between the Democratic
and Republican tickets have changed the complexion of the race.
   ``I think some things happened on that stage, and some things
happened around the country ... that have made this a brand new
campaign,'' he said. ``We're starting to move folks. You can feel
it.''

<HEAD>Water Purifier Added Chemical As it Filtered, FTC Judge Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative judge has ruled that a company
falsely advertised a water purifying device by failing to disclose
it added a probable carcinogen to the water it filtered, a
newspaper reported today.
   Last month's ruling by James P. Timothy of the Federal Trade
Commission said North American Philips Corp. of New York showed
``utter disregard for the welfare of its consumers and blatant
disregard for the law'' in marketing its Norelco Clean Water
Machine, according to The New York Times.
   The FTC had filed an administrative complaint against the
company in August 1987. The complaint said that while ads for the
machine claimed the product made tap water clean or cleaner, they
failed to disclose that filters formerly used in the product
actually added a potentially hazardous chemical to the water.
   The filters, which the company recalled in 1986, added the
chemical methylene chloride to the water that passed through them,
the complaint said. The chemical, used as a solvent in glues,
paints and other substances, has been shown to cause cancer in
laboratory animals, according to the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
   The company sold 186,000 of the filters between 1982 and the
start of the recall in 1986, the Times reported.
   The company said distributing the tainted filters was a
management mistake, and that it would not appeal the judge's
decision, which would become final after review by the five-member
commission, according to the newspaper.
   ``We have never had that kind of accident in our 50 years of
business in North America, and we feel it has reflected too
negatively on our corporation,'' said Winfried C. van't Hoff,
Norelco executive vice president.
   ``Many of the people involved with this thing are no longer with
the company,'' said Samuel J. Rozen, the company's general counsel.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Medical Waste Bill, Sends It Back to House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to combat midnight dumping of
medical wastes has won Senate approval and now goes back to the
House for further action next week.
   The bill, which was passed in the Senate by voice vote Friday
night, sets up a system to track infectious waste like that which
fouled Atlantic beaches last summer.
   The House approved a similar bill on Thursday, but now the two
pieces of legislation must be reconciled before moving toward final
congressional approval.
   ``Spending a day at the beach shouldn't have to be followed by a
day at the doctor,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., a sponsor
of the bill.
   Senate approval came after several minor changes were made in a
version that had been passed by the House, requiring it to be
reconsidered by the House next week.
   The legislation was prompted by the waves of used syringes,
vials of AIDS-infected blood and other hospital waste that washed
up on beaches along the East Coast, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie
during the summer. The waste became a health problem, closing some
beaches because of the threat of hepatitis and other diseases.
   The bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency to
set up a system to track dangerous waste from hospitals, labs and
clinics to its disposal. Initially, the program would cover just 10
states: Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
   Later, the program could be made national in scope if other
states petition to subject their medical waste to the same
cradle-to-grave monitoring system for medical supplies.
   Included in the paper-trail tracking system would be blood,
hypodermic needles, scalpels and surgical and laboratory waste that
has been in contact with infectious agents. They would have to be
segregated from other medical waste and tracked to make sure they
reached a proper disposal facility.
   The problem has received substantial publicity this year after
fouled stretches of beach in New York and New Jersey were closed,
ruining vacations and causing lost revenues for oceanside
businesses and resorts.
   Lautenberg said the waste problem appears to be the result of
illegal dumpers who ``threaten the well-being of their fellow
citizens to save a few dollars in disposal costs.''
   Lawmakers criticized the EPA, which they said has had authority
to regulate the wastes but has ignored the problem.

   Aides to Jim and Tammy Bakker say the
couple will continue to try to regain control of PTL, but they'll
have to take aim at the television mininstry from a slightly
greater distance.
   Volunteers on Friday moved furniture into the new headquarters
of Jim and Tammy Ministries, a house on a 300-acre Pineville estate
owned by Dexter Yager, a regional Amway products distributor.
   The couple had been operating out of a storefront in a shopping
center five miles to the south in Fort Mill, S.C., home of PTL's
Heritage USA Christian theme park, but that office was leased to
someone else, Bakker spokesman Hal Sweigart said.
   PTL bankruptcy trust M.C. ``Red'' Benton announced earlier this
week that he had accepted a $115 million offer for PTL's assets
from Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick, but aides to the Bakkers
say they haven't given up hope of regaining control of the ministry
they founded. Mernick's bid awaits a judge's approval.
   ``We consider the new office an interim step on the way back to
Heritage USA,'' said Lin Robertson, a volunteer at Jim and Tammy
Ministries.
   Bakker's $172 million offer to buy back PTL last month fell
through when he could not prove he had financial backing.
   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting a sexual
encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn seven years earlier.
Three months after Bakker made his admission, the ministry filed
for bankruptcy reorganization.

   A Rhode Island School of Design
instructor says the controversial book ``The Lives of John Lennon''
accurately tells the story of his brief affair with Yoko Ono.
   The unauthorized biography by Albert Goldman describes the
former Beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs. It has been
sharply criticized by Lennon's widow and associates, with Ono
calling it ``totally fiction.''
   But Al Wunderlich, associate professor of painting at RISD, said
Goldman dealt truthfully with his small part in the story.
   ``He was quite thorough and professional when he interviewed
me,'' Wunderlich said. ``He impressed me by knowing a lot of the
details already _ it seemed like ancient history to me.''
   Wunderlich was a friend of Ono's second husband, Tony Cox, and
joined Cox and Ono in Japan for some avant-garde art happenings.
   Goldman's book says that Wunderlich had a brief affair with Ono,
believing that her relationship with Cox was over.

   The government has accused six toothpaste and
mouthwash producers of violating the law by claiming their products
can prevent plaque or gum disease, according to a published report.
   In letters to the companies last July, the Food and Drug
Administration instructed them to stop making the claims or provide
supporting evidence, The Washington Post reported in today's
editions.
   The Post identified the companies and their products as:
Warner-Lambert, Listerine mouthwash; Colgate-Palmolive, Colgate
toothpaste; Beecham Products, Aquafresh toothpaste; Vipont Inc.,
Viadent oral rinse; Oral Research Laboratories, Plax dental rinse;
and Rydelle-Lion Inc., Checkup toothpaste.
   FDA spokeswoman Faye Peterson said other companies had agreed
voluntarily to change their labeling.
   In its letters, the FDA said the companies had not submitted
evidence proving that toothpaste or mouthwash is safe or effective
for dealing with plaque or gingivitis.
   ``We are not aware of any evidence establishing that the product
is generally recognized as safe and effective for gingivitis,'' the
letters said.
   The FDA added that if no evidence was forthcoming, the product
is considered as being ``marketed in violation of the Federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act and at risk of regulatory action.''
   The letters were sent by Rudolf Apodaca, director of the
division of labeling compliance at FDA.

   CBS News correspondent Mike Wallace says the
``sobering'' experience of the 18-week Westmoreland libel trial 3{
years ago led him to tone down his aggressive interviewing style.
   ``You learn how it feels to be the object of the press's
scrutiny,'' Wallace said in an interview appearing in Sunday's
Parade magazine. ``I learned how it must feel for someone I am
covering to believe he is being treated unfairly. That gave me
sobering second thoughts.''
   Gen. William Westmoreland filed a $120 million libel suit
against Wallace and CBS for a 1982 ``60 Minutes'' piece narrated by
Wallace that claimed Westmoreland deceived the American public
about enemy troop strength during the Vietnam War. Westmoreland
dropped the charges in February 1985 before the case went to a jury.
   Wallace said he is less interested now in riling an interviewee
to produce dramatic television.
   ``I used to say I was after light, not heat. But the fact
remained that the heat, more than the light, generated the
attention I got,'' Wallace said. ``Then you grow, you understand
more. Over the years, light has taken precedence.''

of efforts to protect the site of one of the Civil War's bloodiest
battles.
   On a 50-25 vote Friday night, the Senate attached to the tax
bill an amendment by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., that would seize
540 acres of land on which the Second Battle of Manassas was fought
in 1862. The aim of the provision _ which the House already has
approved _ would be to block development of a shopping mall on the
land.
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel has said he would recommend
that President Reagan veto any legislation to which the amendment
was attached.
   ``You are asking the Senate to follow you in a Pickett's charge
to the president's veto pen,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., told
Bumpers.
   But without his amendment Bumpers said, the promontory where
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had his headquarters during the
battle will be paved over. ``And I can see a big granite statue in
that mall (with the inscription): `General Lee stood on this
spot,''' Bumpers said.
   In siding with Bumpers, the Senate turned down a substitute plan
by Warner, which would have allowed the federal government to take
80 acres of the privately owned land and allow housing construction
on adjacent areas.
   Debate over the Manassas amendments and several other non-tax
proposals delayed final action on the bill, whose main purpose is
to correct errors and clear up confusion arising from the big 1986
tax overhaul. The Senate Finance Committee already has attached to
the measure dozens of special tax benefits worth about $2.76
billion plus the assorted tax increases necessary to pay for them.
   The package includes a ``bill of rights'' for taxpayers involved
in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service. The bill relieves
farmers from the federal tax on diesel used for off-road purposes
and from the ``heifer tax'' on livestock-production expenses.
   Other beneficiaries include free-lance artists, corporate
investments in research, first-time homebuyers, contributors to
college athletic funds, and workers who receive employer-financed
legal or education aid.
   The Senate has agreed to a final vote on the bill Tuesday night,
but only after considering another two dozen amendments.
Congressional leaders hope negotiators can then work out a
compromise between the Senate bill and the $7.5 billion version
already approved by the House.
   The tax bill is one of two major measures standing in the way of
adjourning the 100th Congress; the other contains tools to fight
drug abuse. For that reason, senators know that if they have any
hope of getting a pet project approved in the closing days of the
session, it will have to be tacked onto the tax bill.
   At nightfall Friday, more than 100 amendments were waiting to be
considered, and Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., was not
pleased. ``This list is crazy, nuts and getting crazier all the
time,'' Byrd said. ``We ought to settle down and get our senses.''
   Within two hours, Byrd announced senators had agreed to drop all
but 29.
   ``This is the typical tax bill,'' said Republican Leader Bob
Dole of Kansas. ``Everybody cleans out their desks and their trash
cans and says `we'll put it on the tax bill.' We've reached the
point that if somebody doesn't take the bull by the horns, we'll
never finish.''
   The Senate rejected amendments calling for:

discrimination against owners of home satellite dishes by
television programmers. His amendment, aimed at helping the 2
million dish owners, would have required that programs provided to

amendment was unnecessary.
   _An 18-month study of whether government workers should get
equal pay for jobs of comparable worth.
   _A symbolic endorsement of the right of the District of Columbia
to finance abortions for poor women.
   _Raising from $17 a month to $38 the maximum tax-free

<TEXT>
   A woman who heads a tear gas company
earned more money than anybody else in South Korea last year, the
result of a surge in violent protests, tax officials said today.
   The Office of National Tax Administration said in a report to
the National Assembly that Mrs. Han Young-ja, president of the Sam
Young Chemical Co., earned $7.3 million last year and paid $3.4
million in income tax.
   Mrs. Han's company holds a monopoly on the production of tear
gas, a frequently used form of riot control in South Korea.
   The officials attributed Han's high income to frequent
demonstrations by radical students, striking factory workers and
other anti-government groups.
   The nation's second highest income earner last year was Cho
Joong-hoon, chairman of the Hanjin group comprised of about two
dozen subsidiaries including Korean Air, the South Korean flag
carrier. Cho reported $6.3 million in personal income, the
officials said.
   Coming in third was Kim Sung-hyun, chairman of the Korea
Explosives group, who reported an income of $4 million.
   The group's holding firm is Korea Explosives Co. which produces
dynamite.

   A speeding car hit a utility pole Friday
night and careened into a group of five girls on a sidewalk,
killing all of them, authorities said.
   The car hit a tree after striking the girls, said Brown County
Sheriff's Lt. George Weitzel. He said the driver of the car, who a
school principal said was a teen-ager, and his sister were taken to
hospitals and were believed to be in serious condition.
   Four of the girls were dead at the scene and a fifth was
pronounced dead at a hospital, Weitzel said. All were elementary
school students and believed to be between ages 12 and 14.
   The accident occurred at 6:49 p.m. in Pulaski, a village of
1,875 located about 15 miles northwest of Green Bay in northeastern
Wisconsin.
   ``The entire community is in a state of shock,'' said Pulaksi
High School Principal Guy David. He said the driver of the car was
a 16-year-old student at the high school.
   The victims' identities were not immediately available pending
notification of relatives.
   ``We heard they (the girls) were coming from a birthday party or
slumber party, either coming or going. All were on the sidewalk
when it happened,'' Weitzel said.
   ``We got one vehicle with a brother and sister evidently driving
at a high rate of speed. The vehicle hits a power pole, strikes
five girls _ four dead at the scene and one dies at a hospital _
and then the car hit a tree,'' he said.
   David said the five girls were all students at Glenbrook
Elementary School. The children were walking near the village post
office and police station when they were struck, he said.
   ``This is going to be a real problem for the community to deal
with. It will be very difficult,'' he said. ``In a small community
like this, everybody knows everybody.''
   Saturday's high school football game was canceled because of the
tragedy, the principal said.

   Thousands of demonstrators
nationwide marched on goverment buildings and demanded an overhaul
in the communist hierarchy in a spreading wave of ethnic and
economic unrest.
   National Communist Party leaders, trying to control the strife,
promised urgent personnel changes and economic reforms later this
month.
   The protests Friday came just one day after 30,000 people
surrounded a government building in the province of Vojvodina,
battling police and eventually forcing the resignations of the
15-member provincial Politburo.
   More than 10,000 people, some chanting ``You betrayed us,''
staged a similar rally in Titograd on Friday in the republic of
Montenegro, demanding the immediate ouster of the local communist
party leadership.
   The rally in front of the Montenegrin Parliament building was
triggered by a strike of about 1,000 construction firm workers who
put down their tools earlier Friday to protest low wages and
falling living standards, state-run media reports said.
   Several similar protests, triggered by the country's worst
economic and social crisis in history, were staged Friday in
eastern and southern parts of the country.
   Meanwhile, the ruling national Communist presidium issued a
statement saying the policy-making Central Committee plenum to meet
Oct. 17 ``will make necessary personnel changes in the presidium,
which should contribute to the more efficient work of the organ.''
   There have been increasing calls in Yugoslavia for top-level
personnel changes as the unrest continues. The public protests stem
from a general dissatisfaction with a crippled economy and
long-simmering fueds between ethnic groups.
   Communist leaders have been blamed for failing to defuse
tensions between the mostly Christian Slav minority and the largely
Moslem ethnic Albanian majority in the southern Kosovo province _ a
hotbed of unrest _ in the republic of Serbia.
   In Belgrade, 400 high school students from Kosovo marched Friday
on the national Parliament, chanting that Serbs will never give up
power in Kosovo, an autonomous province bordering Albania, Belgrade
radio reported.
   Serbs, who are mainly Christian, charge that persecution by
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians is forcing them to emigrate. Mostly
Moslem ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's
population.
   In Krusevac, 90 miles south of Belgrade, several thousand
workers demonstrated Friday to demand higher wages and the ouster
of Communist leaders, the radio said.
   The presidium statement appealed for urgent changes in the
country's political and economic system to help in resolving the
current crisis, which includes growing labor unrest, a 217 percent
annual inflation and a $21 billion foreign debt.
   In a recent interview, Yugoslav Premier Branko Mikulic said the
country ``will introduce a completly new market-oriented economic
system as of 1989.'' Currently, Yugoslavia's economy is a mixture
of Western-style free market system and Soviet-style central
planning.
   Nearly 100 people, including 14 policemen, were injured in
Thursday's rioting in Vojvodina, in the city of Novi Sad.
Demonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at police.
   The protest eventually caused the mass resignation of the
Vojvodina leadership, which was considered a major victory for the
Serbian communist boss Slobodan Milosevic.
   Milosevic, hailed by his supporters as political heir to the
late President Josip Broz Tito, has been demanding more central
control for his republic over its two provinces, Kosovo and
Vojvodina. Kosovo and Vojvodina are the country's only two
autonomous provinces.
   Thursday's shake-up in Vojvodina has prompted speculation that
Kosovo party leaders could also be on their way out too.

   A fire at a swimming pool company
spewed a cloud of gas over this desert resort, forcing the
evacuation of several hundred residents Friday evening and the
closing of an airport, officials said.
   Thirteen people, including three firefighters, were treated by
ambulance crews for breathing difficulties and burning eyes, but no
serious injuries were reported, said city spokeswoman Ann Erdman.
   The gas, apparently a brew of pool cleaning and treatment
chemicals, spewed from a warehouse during a fire that broke out
about 5:30 p.m., Ms. Erdman said.
   Shortly before 10 p.m., the cloud dissipated, residents were
allowed to return home and the airport was reopened, Ms. Erdman
said. There was no immediate determination of the cause of the fire
at Ocean Pool Mart, or a complete analysis of the chemical
released, she said.
   Chlorine, a common pool chemical, is hazardous, and other
chemicals used in pools include acids.
   The cloud spread over a neighborhood of upper-middle-class homes
and people were evacuated from an area about one-half mile square,
she said.
   ``It's smack in the middle of Palm Springs,'' Ms. Erdman said,
adding that the evacuated area included homes and a few businesses,
but none of the city's hotels.
   Officials weren't immediately able to determine what gases were
in the cloud or the danger posed by the gas, which Ms. Erdman
described as having a stinging, acidic taste.
   No estimate of the number of evacuees was immediately available,
but they probably numbered in the hundreds, the spokeswoman said.
   Commercial flights and private jets en route to Palm Springs
Regional Airport were diverted to Ontario Airport, about 50 miles
to the west. Outgoing flights were canceled and the airport was
evacuated, Ms. Erdman said. Palm Springs is about 110 miles east of
Los Angeles.
   As darkness fell, the cloud appeared to be dispersing and
drifting east, toward the communities of Cathedral City and Rancho
Mirage.

   The son of Emperor Hirohito discouraged people
today from canceling public events in deference to his ailing
father, news reports said.
   ``We appreciate the people's warm consideration very much, but
if it affects their daily lives, I'm afraid it would not make the
emperor happy,'' Crown Prince Akhito was quoted as saying.
   Akihito's remarks, quoted by the domestic Kyodo News Service,
underscored the worry of many Japanese over the proper way to act
during their monarch's illness.
   Hirohito, the world's longest reigning monarch, has been
bedridden since Sept. 19, when he vomited blood from intestinal
homorrhaging. Domestic news media have said he has cancer, but
officials have declined to comment on the reports.
   The 87-year-old monarch remained in stable condition today,
officials at the Imperial Palace said. His temperature fell to 98
degrees from 99.5 the previous night, and a new antibiotic to treat
his inflamed bile duct was apparently working, they said.
   His normal temperature is said to be about 96, but today's
reading was the lowest since last weekend.
   Scores of festivals, events and even official state visits by
foreign dignitaries have been canceled since he fell ill.
   A government spokesman said earlier that the wave of
cancellations would disappoint Hirohito and could hurt social and
economic activity.
   Palace officials have not said exactly what Hirohito knows about
how Japanese are reacting to his illness.
   Hirohito, who has reigned since 1926, remains a symbol of the
Japanese state with only ceremonial duties.

   Nearly 350,000 Chileans took to the
streets in a joyous rally to celebrate President Augusto Pinochet's
defeat in a referendum, but at least 40 people were injured in
violent clashes with police.
   Half a dozen people lay on the street behind Santiago's national
palace Friday evening after police fired tear gas and water cannons
at a crowd of several hundred anti-government demonstrators and
then charged, nightsticks swinging.
   The demonstrators had come from the peaceful rally at an outdoor
park, where the crowd estimated by police at 350,000 swayed and
sang to popular Chilean music.
   About 18 foreign reporters also were injured Friday in the
demonstration at the national palace and other incidents, which
they described as unprovoked attacks by police. At least six were
treated at clinics for head injuries.
   Earlier Friday, soldiers at an army barracks near the rally site
fired birdshot and pellets at passengers in cars who flashed the
victory sign at them, Radio Cooperativa reported.
   Fifteen people were injured, including one who underwent surgery
to remove a pellet from his head, the radio said.
   A spokesman for the Santiago Central Emergency Hospital told The
Associated Press that nine people were treated there for gunshot
wounds, and a tenth was taken to a neurological hospital for
surgery.
   A spokesman for the National Police said there was no one
available to comment on the incidents.
   Friday's rally was organized by the opposition political groups
that urged Chileans to vote ``no'' in Wednesday's referendum in
which Pinochet, 72, lost his bid to remain president until 1997.
   His defeat sets the stage for presidential elections in December
1989 and the inauguration in March 1990 of the first freely elected
president since Pinochet, commander of the army, toppled Salvador
Allende in a bloody coup in 1973.
   Opposition leaders want Pinochet to move up the date of next
year's elections, and vowed Friday to press that demand even though
the aging commander-in-chief firmly rejected it Thursday during a
speech broadcast nationwide.
   ``If we (opposition groups) join together with more force, I
think the situation will change,'' said moderate Socialist Ricardo
Lagos, a leader of the 16-group opposition coalition. ``You have to
give the defeated a couple of days to recover from the shock.''
   Many of the 3.8 million Chileans who voted against Pinochet also
want early elections. ``Chi Chi Chi. Le Le Le. Get Out Pinochet,''
chanted the crowd at the rally.
   Funerals for two people killed during anti-government
demonstrations Thursday night were set for today. Police
acknowleged they shot a 31-year-old man and said a 14-year-old boy
was shot by an unidentified gunman, police said.
   Two others who were shot by unidentified gunmen was hospitalized
in serious condition Friday, police said, adding that eight
officers were injured in clashes with demonstrators Thursday.
   Dozens of people were arrested Thursday and Friday. Most were
released after brief detentions.
   Among the foreign journalists injured were Christopher Morris,
an American freelance photographer for Newsweek, and Liliana Nieto,
an American photographer for the Long Island, N.Y. daily Newsday.
   They and at least three others were treated at Santa Maria
Clinica for head injuries.
   A group of about 50 foreign journalists, mostly Latin American,
walked to a National Police station and filed a complaint
protesting ``the lamentable events against the dignity of reporters
... by national police and other security forces'' and asked for
guarantees of their safety.
   Eva Miranda of Argentina, a spokeswoman for the journalists,
said two reporters _ Eduardo Sanjuan and Jordy Villaroel from TV-3
in Barcelona, Spain _ were hospitalized Friday after they were
beaten by police.

   When it comes to forecasting the
weather, just give Helen Lane a woolly worm and a corn husk.
   ``I think it'll get a little warmer before it gets cold again,
and give us some real nice days in November,'' was her
pronouncement this week on Helen Lane Day in Crab Orchard, a town
60 miles west of Knoxville.
   The 68-year-old prognosticator, considered generally accurate
for the past 29 years, predicted two heavy snowfalls for the coming
winter.
   Mrs. Lane has been making predictions since 1959, when her
warnings of a harsh winter were followed by 28 storms and more than
6 feet of snow.
   ``Don't Say You Weren't Warned'' was the headline in the
Crossville Chronicle, which published her predictions that autumn.
   People have paid attention to her assessment of woolly worms,
corn husks and the number of dense August fogs ever since. The
darker the woolly worms and the thicker the husks, the more severe
the winter will be, she says.
   This will be a generally cold, dry winter, she said Thursday.
There could be more snow than the two storms, she said, but it
won't amount to much.
   Mrs. Lane learned her methods from her father, who in turn
absorbed the lessons handed down from previous generations.

   The biggest fish story of the
week to come out of Lake Hemet lost some of its teeth when a
fisherman's catch turned out to be a vegetarian pacu instead of a
flesh-eating piranha.
   The unusual fish was hooked by a Fullerton man Monday and rumors
quickly spread that the perch-shaped creature with lots of teeth
was a piranha.
   ``I called a state biologist because I'd never seen a piranha,''
other than in books and movies, said Chief Ranger Jim Henry of the
Lake Hemet Municipal Water District.
   Henry froze the fish for examination by biologist Frank Hoover.
   The report that came back Wednesday from the state Department of
Fish and Game said the fish was actually a pacu, a vegetable-eating
creature in the same family as the piranha. A native of South
America, the pacu probably wouldn't have survived the winter in the
lake in the San Jacinto Mountains, about 50 miles east of Los
Angeles.
   Henry also went back to the small lake Thursday to squelch the
rumors among the lake's fishermen.
   State law prohibits importation or possession of piranha but it
doesn't apply to the pacu.
   ``I think somebody is just letting them loose, kind of like
people who start forest fires to sit back and watch,'' Hoover said.

   Two years ago, an activist group described
a near catastrophe at the Savannah River nuclear plant in 1965 but
the report largely went unnoticed.
   This week the incident was detailed by The New York Times,
proving, the activists say, that they are not the ``kooks'' they've
been called for years.
   ``I'm glad that people are beginning to pay attention,'' said
Francis Close Hart, chairwoman of the South Carolina Energy
Foundation, a natural resource policy and education group. ``We've
been saying this kind of thing for a long time.''
   Officials of Du Pont Co., the plant's operator, insisted Friday
that the U.S. government plant _ the nation's sole producer of
weapons-grade plutonium and tritium _ is safe.
   ``We believe these facilities are safe; otherwise, we would not
operate these facilities. We have never had an accident that has
put the community around us or our employees at risk,'' said Jim
Felder, manager of public relations for Du Pont at the sprawling
operation in Aiken, near the Georgia line.
   Du Pont President Edgar S. Woolard sent a telegram to four U.S.
senators Friday saying the company welcomed their call for a review
of the plant's operations following a congressional hearing in
which the U.S. Energy Department disclosed 30 serious mishaps that
previously were kept secret.
   The New York Times' story, based on a memo found in a public
document room at the University of South Carolina in Aiken, said
some cooling water leaked in a reactor and a foreman wanted to
close valves that limit the cooling water supply.
   The foreman's senior supervisor prevented the valves from being
closed, narrowly averting disaster, according to the Du Pont
engineer who wrote the memo.
   The foundation's report two years ago quoted the same engineer
and said closing the valves would have caused the reactor to
destroy itself.
   Ms. Hart said the Times' story was the ``most dramatic'' example
she knew of the popular press catching up with news her group has
reported.
   ``I'm not one to say I told you so,'' said Michael Lowe, a
nuclear specialist with the environmental group Greenpeace. ``On
the other hand, I'm glad we're able to say I told you so now
instead of when one of these accidents get out of hand.''
   Though activists have for the last decade pointed to problems at
the plant, they've learned during the past two weeks more details
about safety problems there.
   Michael Clark, president of the Washington-based Environmental
Policy Institute, a non-profit environmental research and advocacy
group, said his group used the federal Freedom of Information Act
to obtain 50,000 pages of information about the plant.
   But, he said, that information only revealed two of the 30
serious mishaps listed in a document made public by the federal
Energy Department at the congressional hearing a week ago.
   ``We are now wondering what else is going on there that the
public hasn't been told about,'' he said. ``It's a rogue operation.
It's out of control.'' About 100 protesters have been arrested at
the plant during the last decade, according to leaders of the Grass
Roots Organizing Workshop, a group based in Columbia that organized
the major protests at the plant.
   ``It's clear that people who had been calling us kooks 10 years
ago are now saying the same thing we were'' about the safety
problems, said Brett Bursey, the group's director.

   The discovery of a dead Palestinian, his hands
tied with army-issue rope, triggered a new round of clashes between
Arabs and soldiers and the highest one-day death toll in six
months, Arab reports said.
   Israeli troops shot and killed four Palestinians and 21 others
were wounded during the violence in the occupied territories.
   An army official confirmed one death in the West Bank city of
Nablus but said soldiers were not involved. He said the army was
checking the other fatalities.
   In another development, the body of a Palestinian suspected of
collaborating with Israel was found in a cave near the West Bank
village of Burka, Israel radio and Arab reports said. The man,
32-year-old Mohammed Shaar, was stabbed to death, the reports said.
The army said it was checking the report.
   The deaths Friday brought to 289 the number of Palestinians
killed since the uprising against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8.
Six Israelis also have died.
   In Nablus Friday morning, hundreds of Palestinians chanting
pro-PLO slogans carried the coffin of Adnan Hanfa, 31, through the
city's narrow alleys.
   Hanfa was killed Thursday night, but the circumstances of his
death were unclear. Arab hospital officials said Hanfa was shot
several times and found cuffed with army-issue plastic rope.
   Army officials said troops shot and killed a Palestinian in
clashes Thursday night near Salah Edin Mosque where Hanfa's body
was found.
   Following the funeral and Moslem noon prayers, stone-throwing
Arab youths clashed with soldiers throughout Nablus and the two
adjacent refugee camps of Balata and Askar.
   Arab reporters claimed Samir Bahloul, 26, was in the doorway of
his house when he was fatally shot in the head and stomach by
troops breaking up a nearby protest. The army confirmed the death
but said troops were not involved.
   Nidal Ali Najar, 20, was fatally shot in the head after dozens
of Arab youths gathered outside the central market to throw stones
at soldiers to protest Bahloul's death, hospital officials said.
   Ali Sayeh, 20, was dead on arrival at St. John's Hospital in
Nablus after being shot in the chest during a clash in the Ras Al
Ain neighborhood, Arab reporters and hospital officials said.
   A fourth Palestinian, 17-year-old Ahmed Mashtaraweh, was shot in
the head during a clash and died en route to Jerusalem's Mukassed
Hospital, hospital officials said.
   Of the 21 wounded, two were in critical condition, including a
9-year-old boy with a bullet in the chest, Arab hospital officials
said.

<HEAD>Few Know About North America's Deadliest Fire</HEAD>

   Most Peshtigo Fire Museum visitors never
heard of North America's deadliest fire, which erupted 117 years
ago today and killed 1,150 people but was overshadowed by the
famous Chicago conflagration.
   ``A lot of tourists go through here, and it surprises me most
people are unaware of the tragedy,'' said Stella Van Bogart, a
museum curator. ``The museum's been open 25 years and this still
goes on.''
   ``It's something that people around here remember. It's taught
in elementary school classes,'' said Peshtigo School Superintendent
George Fox.
   Still, even in this northeast Wisconsin community of about
3,000, the anniversary will go unmarked.
   The small museum, housed in a church built after the blaze, has
only a tabernacle and a few charred pieces of wood to memorialize
the inferno. Next to the church is a graveyard where a stone marks
a mass grave for about 350 unidentified victims.
   Ed Kautz of the U.S. Forest Service said the Peshtigo fire
remains the blaze with the highest known death toll on the
continent. It also is the world's second-deadliest blaze, surpassed
only by an 1845 fire at a theater in Canton, China, killing 1,670,
according to The World Almanac.
   The fire helped spur the development of many firefighting and
conservation techniques still used today, said Kautz and state
forest firefighting specialists.
   Fueled and spread by a tornado, the inferno killed at least
1,150 people, burned about 1.28 million acres of pine forest in
eight counties and caused $5 million in damage, not counting lost
timber.
   But the fire that destroyed Peshtigo, which took 30 years to
rebuild, has become a footnote in history to a smaller fire. On the
same day, Oct. 8, 1871, the famous Chicago fire erupted. It killed
250 people during its four-day rampage.
   A drought parched northeastern Wisconsin most of the summer and
fall of 1871. Despite that, loggers continued to clear the land,
leaving slash and other debris in continuously burning piles.
   Railroad workers extending track and farmers clearing land also
piled or burned debris for acres.
   As many townspeople were returning from an evening church
service or eating supper, the fire began.
   Historian Stewart H. Holbrook wrote: ``A southwest wind blew
flurries of white ashes on the town like a snowstorm. Then
townspeople heard what sounded like the rumble of a train and then
a roar as the fiery tornado descended on it.''
   Pine sidewalks and houses were ablaze when a rush of gale-force
wind sent sheets of fire onto the town from the red, glowing sky.
   The tornado-swept fire was preceded by blinding smoke. About 300
people were killed on a wooden bridge after they ran onto it to
flee the blaze, but it collapsed and burned. Some were wedged
between the burning logs in the water.
   The intense wind blew fire like a blow torch from the banks to
burn the heads of people who sought safety in neck-deep Peshtigo
River.
   So many people were burned to ashes that teeth often were the
only way to distinguish animals from man, survivors said.
   Others were killed by the tornado, suffocated after seeking
refuge in wells, or were trampled by terrified cattle.
   In one case, a father slit the throats of his four children and
wife and then himself to spare them a burning death.
   Historical accounts indicated the fire lasted an hour in
Peshtigo, from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., before moving on to other
villages. Historians estimate that about 800 of Peshtigo's 1,700
residents were killed and at least 350 in the other communities
died. About 1,500 people were badly injured and 3,000 were left
homeless.
   No one knew of the Peshtigo fire for days because telegraph
poles had burned down almost a month earlier in other small brush
fires. Help did not reach victims for several days.

   Police in jeeps and trucks broke up a
gathering of 2,000 people when a satiric dissident group tried to
hold a demonstration ``to defend communism'' at a monument to the
founder of the Soviet secret police.
   About 50 people were arrested Friday by uniformed and
plainclothed police, who started seizing demonstrators and checking
their identity papers even before the rally was to begin at 3 p.m.
at a busy central plaza.
   The rally was organized by the Orange Alternative, a movement
which has gained popularity among young people in recent years with
its ``happenings'' that poke fun at authorities. The movement is
based in the southwestern city of Wroclaw.
   ``You have two minutes to disperse. No jokes any more. Go
home,'' police said over loudspeakers before driving jeeps and
trucks through the crowd huddled along sidewalks accross from the
busy square. Demonstrators chanted ``KGB'' and ``Solidarity.''
   Scuffles broke out as police chased demonstrators who darted in
front of oncoming trams and rush-hour traffic to avoid detention.
Demonstrators blew plastic whistles and jeered at the police, who
formed cordons and shoved the crowd into adjacent side streets.
   One policeman bloodied his face after tripping on the pavement
while chasing a fleeing youth. Police refrained from using their
truncheons, but tried to control the size of the crowd by refusing
to let people get out of arriving trams.
   Protesters took shelter after the police moved in, rushing away
from the oncoming police vehicles into shops adjoining the plaza,
and a minor brawl erupted in one shoestore when officers tried to
seize a banner carried by three youths.
   Some demonstrators, including women and old people, were roughed
up or pulled by the hair while being detained.
   It took the police more than two hours to clear the square.
   The rally was held at Dzierzynski Square, named after Feliks
Dzierzynski, a Polish supporter of the Bolshevik Revolution who in
1918 founded the Cheka, the secret police organization that was the
forerunner of today's KGB.
   The protest coincided with the officially proclaimed
``Policeman's Day'' in Poland. Earlier in the day, a police
delegation placed flowers and Polish flags at the bottom of the
monument.
   Organizers had put up colorful orange-lettered posters at Warsaw
University and distributed leaflets throughout the city announcing
the rally. Police began patrolling the square early Friday morning.
   A spokesman for the Independent Student Association, known by
its Polish initials NZS, said police detained five people Thursday
night in advance of the rally and four others received telephone
warnings not to participate.
   In June, about 1,000 Orange Alternative supporters held mock
elections and lampooned various government officials in Warsaw on
the day of nationwide municipal elections. Police did not interfere.

<HEAD>Improved Down's Syndrome Test Found More Accurate, Safer, Cheaper</HEAD>

   A new screening test that is more accurate,
safer and far less expensive than existing ones for prenatal
detection of Down's syndrome could be available for widespread use
in two or three years, researchers say.
   If the test were given to every pregnant woman in the United
States, it could catch 60 percent of the estimated 5,000 cases that
occur annually, compared with the maximum 20 percent detection rate
possible with existing tests, the researchers say.
   Down's syndrome is the nation's most common disorder of the
chromosomes _ the microscopic threads in each cell that carry
genes, which govern hereditary characteristics.
   Down's syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, a broad
face and slanting eyes.
   The existing test uses a procedure called amniocentesis, in
which a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is
withdrawn and fetal cells in the fluid are examined for the
presence of chromosomal defects.
   The procedure costs about $1,000 and leads to miscarriages in
about one in 200 mothers who receive it, doctors said.
   The new test, done by measuring the levels of three substances
in the mother's bloodstream, identifies women at highest risk of
having children with Down's syndrome, said one of the authors of
the study, Jacob Canick, a biochemist at Brown University and Women
and Infant's Hospital, both in Providence, R.I.
   The other authors include Dr. James Haddow of the Foundation for
Blood Research in Scarborough, Maine, and Dr. Nicholas Wald of the
Medical College of St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London.
   In the absence of such a test, doctors assess risk based only on
the mother's age _ the older the mother, the higher the risk. The
new test provides a much more accurate assessment of risk, Canick
said in a telephone interview Friday.
   The researchers measured three substances to assess risk:
alpha-fetoprotein, estriol and human chorionic gonadotropin, all
made by the fetus or placenta and carried in the mother's
bloodstream. Risk of Down's syndrome was linked to low levels of
alpha-fetoprotein and estriol and high levels of human chorionic
gonadotropin in the mothers' blood, said Haddow.
   The test will probably cost $50 to $60, and because it is a
simple blood test done on the mother it carries no risk of
miscarriage, Canick said.
   In the study, the test was done on mothers during the second
trimester of pregnancy, when amniocentesis is usually performed.
   Prenatal detection of a birth defect could lead a physician to
recommend abortion.
   In a study reported in the current issue of the British Medical
Journal, Canick and his colleagues found that the test was accurate
enough to enable doctors to detect 60 percent of all cases of
Down's syndrome in the United States if it were given to all
pregnant women.
   Amniocentesis is now recommended for pregnant women over age 35.
If it were given to all of them it would identify only 20 percent
of Down's syndrome cases, Canick said.
   Dr. Aubrey Milunsky, director of Boston University's Center for
Human Genetics, said of the findings: ``There is every likelihood
that this order of efficiency or detection will be attainable. It's
likely to be an extremely valuable screening method for prenatal
detection for not only Down's syndrome,'' but also other chromosome
disorders.
   Milunsky, who was not connected with the study, said he will
shortly publish his own study in the American Journal of Obstetrics
and Gynecology showing that similar testing can be effective as
early as the eighth to 12th week of pregnancy.
   In May, researchers announced that a government study found that
another method of determining chromosome abnormalities in a fetus
as early as the eighth week of pregnancy was safe and accurate.
   The technique is called chorionic villus sampling. Using a
special device, a doctor snips off a tiny piece of chorionic villus
tissue, which grows from an enveloping membrane that eventually
gives rise to the placenta. The tissue, which is genetically
identical to the fetus, is then tested for abnormalities.

   Burma's U.N. ambassador defended his
government's crackdown on recent protests, but he also told the
world body that his nation is moving toward democracy.
   Ambassador Maung Maung Gyi, in an address to the U.N. General
Assembly on Friday, said the military government has imposed ``a
reasonable measure of stability'' since it came to power after a
Sept. 18 coup.
   He said his country has gone through ``a crisis ... turmoil and
unrest when unavoidable incidents occur.''
   Authorities ``are making arrangements for holding general
elections that will be free and fair, in which all political
parties can participate, so that the multiparty democratic system
... may be fully established,'' he said.
   ``When there is a need to establish law and order and when ...
the nation is threatened, it is the duty and obligation of the
authorities of state to assume their responsibilities to overcome
such difficulties.
   ``The prevailing situation today is that our nation is
overcoming the period of disruption and has achieved a reasonable
measure of stability.''
   Burma has been ruled by repressive military governments since a
coup in 1962. Pro-democracy protests, however, have burgeoned this
year as the nation's economy has deteriorated.
   In Rangoon, two more political parties registered on Friday,
bringing to nine the number that have gained official recognition
and the right to run candidates.
   Rangoon radio said one person was killed when soldiers opened
fire on about 100 people removing corrugated iron roofing from an
already looted cigarette factory in a northern Rangoon suburb.
   The government has said about 440 people have been killed since
Gen. Saw Maung's coup three weeks ago.
   Japan, West Germany and the United States have suspended aid to
Burma, although Washington has said it would continue humanitarian
assistance. Japan said Friday it will provide $450,000 in emergency
food aid through the U.N. Children's Fund.
   ``This doesn't mean we approve of Saw Maung's military
government,'' Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno said in Tokyo.

   The British Designer Show opened with a burst of
color, a breath of Eastern adventure and a boost from Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   If the 300 designers exhibiting at the four-day show have their
way, next summer's look will be soft, shapely, leggy and exotic
with a bit of the zany eccentricity that has become a British
fashion hallmark.
   ``It's going to be brights and colors,'' said designer Benny
Ong. ``I think women have now come to realize that color is no
longer an apology for being themselves. It's like a coming out
party for women ... so, long live color!''
   Added David Sassoon, who designs for most of the British royals:
``I think it's a softer, more fluid look -- away from the
constructed dresses of last season.''
   Sandwiched between the Milan and Paris shows, London has become
an important stopping off point for buyers in the last five years,
especially those looking for something different. Organizers expect
6,000 buyers by the tie the show, which opened Friday, concludes on
Monday.
   ``France is a wonderful seduction. Italy is healthy and always
good and England is more of the adventure and the whimsy,'' said
Bernie Ozer, vice president of New York's Associated Merchandising
Corp., the world's largest international marketing and buying
service whose clients range from Harrods to Bloomingdales.
   The London fashion showcase has been a crucial selling platform
for the British clothing industry, whose exports increased from
$1.7 billion in 1984 to $2.43 billion in 1987.
   Mrs. Thatcher, an avid backer of British trade, held a reception
for top designers and buyers at her official 10 Downing St.
residence Friday night _ the social highlight of the London shows.
   She presented the British Fashion Council's Designer of the Year
award to Turkish-born Rifat Ozbek, whose powerful figure-hugging
clothes have won international acclaim since he started his own
label four years ago.
   Though Ozbek is not showing his summer collection until Monday,
a sneak preview revealed a distinct Middle Eastern feel in his
prints mixed with kaftan-stitched linens and striped pyjamas.
   But the London message seems to be coming from further east, in
Malaysia, Singapore and India: the sarong is the skirt for summer
and there are several filmy sari-like shawls and wraps.
   Betty Jackson used the atmosphere of Indonesia for her printed
and sequinned sarong skirts. Edina Ronay, who designs for the
Duchess of York, also featured sarongs, and Arabella Pollen, a
favorite of Princess Diana, used the sarong as the main skirt for
her collection.
   ``It's a sort of fake sarong,'' Ms. Pollen said. ``It's a nice
safe sarong. It actually fits quite nicely in the back and the
sarong is an extra piece. I hate those sarongs where when you shift
your leg the whole thing moves.''
   Washed silks from the East were also popular with Betty Jackson,
Arabella Pollen and Workers for Freedom, one of London's young
design teams. They featured a ``Summer Eskimos'' collection of
burnt orange and indigo tie-dye washable silk off-one-shoulder
tunics teamed with sequinned lace long skirts or pants.
   At the top end of the market, where eccentricity rarely reaches,
there was concern that the American buyers might continue to stay
away because of the strong pound and weak dollar _ and about the
state of the industry as a whole.

   The owner of the idled Shoreham nuclear power
plant on New York's Long Island has vowed to fight an appeals board
ruling taking away authorization for the plant to receive a
full-power operating license.
   ``We will appeal (the) decision directly to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission,'' Jim Lois, a spokesman for Long Island
Lighting Co., said Friday.
   Lois was reacting to a ruling Friday by a three-judge panel of
the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeals Board that a licensing
panel did not have the authority to remove state and local
governments as intevenors in the case.
   As a result, the appeals board said, all outstanding emergency
planning issues had not been resolved in the Shoreham case and the
basis for the full-power license authorization ``does not exist.''
   On Sept. 23, a three-judge panel of the Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board threw out New York state, Suffolk County and the
Town of Southampton as intervenors in a case involving an emergency
evacuation drill conducted at Shoreham. The panel also found that
there was reasonable assurance that the public's safety could be
protected in the event of an accident at the reactor.
   Both the appeal board and the licensing panel are part of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   State and local authorities have refused to participate in
emergency planning at the reactor, which has been completed since
1984 but has never operated. They maintain that Long Island could
not be safely evacuated in an emergency.
   Current federal regulation prevents the NRC from issuing a
full-power license to a nuclear plant unless there is an emergency
plan that gives reaasonable assurance the public will be safe if an
accident occurs.
   Francis Sheehan, a spokesman for New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, said
the governor had no immediate comment on the court decision.

   Radio City no longer has a radio station.
   With tears, memories, and voices from the past, WNBC went off
the air Friday after 62 years of broadcasting that included the
first commercial, the comedy of Jack Benny and Bob Hope, and the
conducting of Arturo Toscanini.
   ``We have a very big supply of tissues here at the studio,''
said Alan Colmes, host of the last radio show from the NBC studios
in Rockefeller Center, which inspired the name of the neighboring
Radio City Music Hall. A sports-talk station took over the 660 spot
on the AM dial.
   ``It's historic, but sad,'' Colmes said. ``There is something
about this building, maybe a radio muse that makes everything so
special. The list of people who have been fired from this station
is a who's who of radio.''
   At the end of Friday's show, everyone in the studio counted down
from 10, but the power was turned off before NBC's distinctive
three-gong chime could sound for the last time. The switch was
thrown at 5:30 p.m. and WFAN signed on.
   The new station, which has its studios in Queens, takes over a
50,000-watt, clear-channel signal that can be picked up in as many
as 35 states at night.
   Colmes began the last show routinely, by reading a mattress
commercial, and got an unexpected laugh.
   ``And for a limited time, just mention WNBC and you'll get a
free mattress cover. Make that very limited,'' Colmes cracked.
   While there were a lot of laughs, it was a bittersweet show,
featuring visits and telephone calls from some famous WNBC veterans
and well-wishers, including Bill Cullen, Ed McMahon, Joyce
Brothers, ``Cousin'' Bruce Morrow, Alan King, Marv Albert, Gabe
Pressman and Ted Brown.
   The demise of WNBC, announced earlier this year, is the result
of the $6 billion deal in 1985 in which General Electric Co. bought
RCA Corp., the parent company of NBC.
   Federal Communications Commission rules prevent a new owner from
keeping both a television and radio station in the same market, so
GE decided to sell its newly acquired radio properties and keep the
more profitable WNBC-TV.
   The changes, announced Feb. 18, mean about 50 WNBC employees are
out of work.
   The NBC radio network went to Westwood One for $55 million. Five
local stations _ including WNBC and WYNY-FM in New York _ brought
$121 million from Emmis Broadcasting Corp. GE has one station left,
KNBR in San Francisco, which is for sale.
   Emmis' WFAN, which had been at 1050 on the dial, features
play-by-play of Mets baseball games and other sports events.
   WNBC began its farewell broadcast with a taped 90-minute survey
of the station's history.
   The station went on the air in April 1922 as an AT&T experiment
that settled on the call letters WEAF five months later.
   In 1926, the Radio Corp. of America and its NBC network, created
to help sell the radios it was producing, bought WEAF for $1
million. The station's call letters were changed to WNBC in 1946,
changed again in 1954 to WRCA, then reverted to WNBC in 1960.
   Many firsts attributed to NBC's forerunner, WEAF, include: the
first World Series broadcast, 1923; the first coast-to-coast
hookup, 1924; and the first broadcast of national political
conventions, 1924.
   The first radio commercial was aired on WEAF on Aug. 28, 1922,
when a real estate developer paid $100 for a 10-minute sales pitch
for apartments.
   Friday's show included clips from programs featuring Hope,
Benny, Fred Allen, George and Gracie Allen, and the NBC Symphony
conducted by Toscanini.
   Other NBC classics also were showcased: ``Amos 'n' Andy,''
``Doctor IQ,'' ``You Bet Your Life'' with Groucho Marx, ``The Big
Show'' and ``Monitor.''
   In the early 1960s, as television became the showplace for the
stars, the station dropped soap operas, mysteries, quiz shows and
live big band performances and began broadcasting news, call-in
programs and music shows.

   Fourteen-year-old Ray Bateman Jr. is almost a
typical American teen-ager. Except for his preoccupation with
finding a cure for colon cancer.
   Ray collaborated with cancer researcher Dr. Glen Tisman and
delivered their test results Friday to the American Federation for
Clinical Research.
   ``Ray has tremendous scientific gifts that come naturally,''
Tisman said after watching the teen-ager deliver the slide show and
speech in a steady, if squeaky, voice.
   ``This started as a school project, but obviously got much
bigger,'' said Ray, flashing a brace-bedecked smile after the
presentation.
   The Huntington Beach, Calif., computer whiz received two rounds
of applause from a group of two dozen researchers.
   ``I think it was very exciting,'' said Dr. Mark Moskowitz of
Newton, Mass., who attended the presentation. ``We need more young
investigators. ... He could be the first of a new generation of
medical researchers.''
   Ray was accompanied to the convention by his parents and Tisman.
The pair worked together on a plan to combine a chemical,
5-Fluorodeoxyuridine _ 5FUdR for short _ with a vitamin derivative
in an effort to kill cancer cells, the teen-ager said.
   Both agreed the plan needed additional testing, although initial
indicators showed it had potential in fighting cancer.
   Ray delivered the research because the research federation's
rules state that if two authors submit a paper and one is older
than 41, the younger one must make the presentation. Tisman is 46;
he recruited Ray to assist in doing computer analyses of his
research.
   ``What Ray has done here is make the whole thing possible,''
Tisman said.
   Ray, who spent an estimated 1,300 hours on the research, said he
hoped to continue work on the therapy and start a career in
medicine. The teen-ager's parents say they have spent $25,000 on

   ``I would like to be involved in something both research and
clinical,'' Ray said. ``I don't think it would be all that much fun
to do research and not see it applied.''

   A member of the grand jury that
rejected Tawana Brawley's story of abduction and rape by a gang of
whites said no evidence whatsoever supported the black teen-ager's
tale.
   ``This thing wasn't a mere preponderance of evidence,'' said
Anthony Montanari. ``It was all the evidence that pointed to the
conclusion that we drew.''
   But Jimmy Powell, one of two black members of the 23-member
grand jury that disbanded Friday after probing the case since Feb.
29, said he was unconvinced the 16-year-old was lying. He said he
opposed the vote to accept the 170-page report.
   ``The evidence wasn't there to support the conclusion,'' Powell
said Friday.
   He said he wasn't the only grand juror to disagree with the
report, but wouldn't give any more details about the deliberations.
   The report flatly stated Miss Brawley had not been sexually
assaulted. It said all evidence suggested that the teen-ager, found
last Nov. 28 with racial epithets and dog feces smeared on her
body, had inflicted the condition on herself.
   Miss Brawley, who said she was abducted for four days, was found
in a garbage bag outside her family's former apartment in
Wappingers Falls, 75 miles north of New York City.
   State Supreme Court Judge Angelo Ingrassia, who ordered the
report released to the public, said the grand jury's conclusions
``were beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   Timothy Gilles, spokesman for Attorney General Robert Abrams,
said Abrams wouldn't comment on the grand jury deliberations. Grand
jury reports do not have to be unanimous. The New York Daily News
reported the vote was 22-1.
   Montanari refused to discuss the panel's final vote, saying he
feared he'd be guilty of a crime.
   Montanari said evidence linking charred cloth used to scrawl the
slurs ``KKK'' and ``nigger'' on the girl's body to fibers found
under Miss Brawley's fingernails proved to be crucial in clinching
the case.
   ``That was very, very revealing,'' he said.
   But he said that testimony from Miss Brawley, who refused to
cooperate with the grand jury on the advice of her advisers, would
have made a difference.
   ``There's only one person who's sure to know what happened to
Tawana Brawley and that's Tawana Brawley,'' Montanari said.
   The other black grand juror, George Pelote, who voted to approve
the report, told the Daily News, ``We all felt something did happen
to her, but not what was claimed by her.''
   In Chicago, the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of Miss Brawley's three
advisers, said the girl would appear at a news conference over the
weekend to discuss ``the substance of the grand jury findings.''
   ``We have information and evidence that is going to rock the
world,'' said Sharpton.
   He said the Brawley family, which now lives in Virginia Beach,
Va., had been invited to attend the Chicago convention three months
ago by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
   ``We want to sit down with Minister Farrakhan ... to go over
several of the contradictions in the report ... and make a very
itemized analysis of it,'' Sharpton said.

<HEAD>Replica Of World's First Motion Picture Studio Rededicated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The rededication of a replica of the
world's first motion picture studio, where Thomas Edison produced
such films as ``The Great Train Robbery,'' has some movie buffs
hoping more films will be made there.
   Friday's ceremony at the recently renovated studio kicked off a
five-year fund-raising campaign.
   Supporters of the Edison National Historic Site want to raise at
least $5 million to help build an auditorium where students and
others could perform in films and to make the more than 400,000
artifacts at the site easily accessible to visitors.
   Special movie-making demonstrations are planned over the weekend
to mark the 100th anniversary today of Edison's filing legal
protection for his kinetograph, the forerunner of the modern-day
motion picture camera.
   Edison dubbed the studio ``Black Maria,'' an old slang term for
a black police paddy wagon, which it resembles. Besides the Black
Maria, the historic site is home to Edison's library, laboratory,
research and development complex and Victorian mansion.
   ``One of the great things about the site is that Edison's
inventions are here. They work. Visitors can participate and
touch,'' said Fahy Whitaker, who supervises the site's staff for
the National Park Service.
   At least 12,000 students a year, mainly from New Jersey, tour
the Edison site and learn about filmmaking, Ms. Whitaker said.
   ``Part of our plans are to have a movie made here. But we're not
sure what,'' Ms. Whitaker said.
   Edison, also famous for his work at a Menlo Park lab, is said to
have built the West Orange laboratory in 1887 to develop inventions
quickly and cheaply. There he also perfected the phonograph and the
alkaline battery.
   Friday's visitors watched as actress Ruth Warrick of ABC-TV's
``All My Children'' and other volunteers portrayed a scene from
``The Great Train Robbery'' inside the studio.
   The original black tar paper studio, a separate building next to
others that house Edison artifacts, was designed and constructed by
the inventor in 1893 at his West Orange laboratory. Edison tore
down the first studio in 1903; the reproduction was constructed 50
years later.
   Like the original, the replica has a roof that opens to provide
sunlight for filming.
   Money for the studio renovation was donated by the National Tour
Association, the largest group-travel organization in the United
States.
   ``What we wanted to do is take a site lesser known or lesser
used in the national park system and focus on it so people
understand that the national parks are more than Yellowstone,''
said Jim Host, the group's executive vice president.

   The sister of the longest-held hostage in
Lebanon, journalist Terry Anderson, said it will be ``very
devastating'' to her brother if he is not released by the Nov. 8
presidential election.
   ``Terry is geared to the elections,'' Peggy Say said Friday,
based on the word she received from a recently freed hostage.
   ``He feels it will take that to get him out of there. I'm afraid
if they come and go, it's going to be very devastating to him.''
   The last word on Anderson's condition came from Marcel Fontaine,
a French hostage released in May, said Mrs. Say, who lives in
Cadiz, Ky. Fontaine said Anderson was hanging on, with hopes of
release by the election.
   A Beirut magazine said Friday the American hostages would be
freed before the election. And an Israeli newspaper said the United
States made a deal with Iran to free the American hostages in
exchange for delivery of arms and spare parts to Iran through South
Korea. U.S. officials denied the report.
   Mrs. Say also criticized the U.S. government for refusing to
negotiate the release of her brother and the six other Americans
held by Islamic extremists in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say told editors and publishers Friday at the fall
newspaper meeting of the Kentucky Associated Press that the United
States routinely has negotiated the release of other American
hostages in the Middle East and elsewhere.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was abducted March 16, 1985. He will be 41 on Oct. 27.
   Mithileshwar Singh, a 60-year-old Indian citizen and resident
alien of the United States, was released Monday, raising hope for
the freedom of the other hostages. Mrs. Say said Singh was never in
contact with her brother.

   Authorities hauled away about a dozen leaders of a
group demanding democratic change during a rally that drew more
than 1,000 people to a city square.
   However, they let others in the crowd at Pushkin Square Friday
argue for hours about whether freedom and democracy really exist in
the Soviet Union.
   ``What kind of democracy is this?'' onlookers shouted at police
and paramilitary troops who elbowed and shoved their way into the
crowd. The demonstrators hoisted small signs calling for freedom
and democracy.
   Friday was Constitution Day in the Soviet Union, a national
holiday. A group called the Democratic Union mounted the protest to
demand democratic changes.
   Police hauled away a woman carrying a small child after she
briefly lifted a sign and began arguing loudly with an elderly man.
   ``We do have freedom in this country!'' the man said.
   ``Aren't you ashamed?'' she replied, gesturing at the police as
they came to take her away.
   The police moved gently for the most part, exhorting people
through megaphones to ``move on.'' After 45 minutes, when the crowd
had not responded, the demands softened to ``Please move on.''
   A police officer said through the loudspeakers repeatedly: ``The
people's deputies have ordered there will be no meeting.''
   ``What people?'' said a man in the crowd who was elegantly
dressed in a gray suit.
   At least 10 busloads of police and paramilitary troops were at
the square in central Moscow, but fewer than 100 men actually went
into the crowd.
   Arguments sprang up among bystanders, with some criticizing and
others defending the government. Whenever arguments in the square
evolved into speeches, police moved in.
   How many in the crowd supported the demonstrators became clear
when one raised a protest sign half an hour after the initial
detentions. About 50 of the more than 1,000 onlookers applauded,
but the rest merely craned their necks to read the sign.
   Stanislav Dergunov, a member of the fledgling Democratic Union,
said the group's main objective was to change Article 6 of the
constitution, which gives the Communist Party a monopoly on power.
   In the tense moments following the detentions, when no one knew
whether police would stop after taking the protest leaders,
journalists and police gathered around Nikita Kirilov.
   He carried a 1960s peace sign and a wore a handmade badge with a
drawing of barbed wire that identified him as a Democratic Union
member.
   ``I'm not holding a demonstration. I'm giving an interview,'' he
told police.
   They left him alone.
   Col. Georgy Postoyuk, the police supervisor on the scene,
finally ordered his men to back off. He denied anyone had been
arrested and declared, smiling, ``They're all here.''

   Several hundred residents were
allowed to return home and the regional airport was reopened after
a toxic cloud that spewed from a swimming pool company dissipated,
officials said today.
   Three members of the police and fire departments were admitted
to Desert Hospital for chlorine inhalation. The incident began
about 5:30 p.m. Friday when fire broke out at the Ocean Pool Mart
and prompted evacuations in a square-mile residential area, said
police Sgt. Tom Barton.
   Fumes from chlorine, a common pool chemical, can burn skin and
eyes and cause respiratory problems.
   The injured firefighters and police officers were not seriously
hurt and were expected to be released today, Barton said.
   Several residents also complained of breathing difficulty and
eye irritation, but none was hospitalized, Barton said.
   ``I could smell the chlorine in the air. It made my nose burn
and it gave me a slight headache,'' said Hazel Reed, who is
vacationing at a condominium in the evacuated area.
   Residents were allowed to return home about 9:30 p.m., Barton
said.
   Commercial flights and the many private jets coming into Palm
Springs Regional Airport were diverted to Ontario Airport, about 50
miles to the west. Outgoing flights from this desert resort 110
miles east of Los Angeles were canceled and the airport was
evacuated, officials said.

   Pope John Paul II began a four-day
visit to France today and called on Europe to unite as a continent
guided by Christian values honoring human dignity and the ideals of
liberty, tolerance and respect for law.
   Speaking in French to the 21-nation Council of Europe, the pope
said the countries of the old continent should remember their
common Christian heritage and apply it to policy governing family
life, technology, education and employment.
   ``The most urgent problem on which all nations should cooperate
is access to work,'' the pope said.
   ``Is it utopian to ask that when decisions of an economic nature
are made there should be consideration of the trials of those who
lose through unemployment a part of their dignity and sometimes
even their strength to hope?'' he asked.
   John Paul, making his fourth visit to France and his 40th
foreign trip as pope, was greeted in a light rain at
Strasbourg-Entzheim airport by President Francois Mitterrand, who
spoke in his welcoming remarks of a ``dream of a unified Europe.''
   About 150 dignitaries were joined at the airport by about 200
other people, including children who waved yellow papal pennants
and red, blue and white French flags.
   The pontiff, speaking in French, said the Roman Catholic church
views ``with satisfaction the efforts made by the European
countries to tighten still more their bonds and forge a common
future.
   ``I see it as a matter of urgency that these peoples draw from
the common wellsprings of the faith and values which are their most
precious heritage,'' he said.
   The pope's DC-9 Alitalia plane left Rome just as a strike was
getting under way at Leonardo da Vinci airport by pilots, flight
technicians and airport personnel in a dispute over reorganization
of airport management.
   In the past, the Polish-born pontiff has called on Europeans to
draw together on the basis of their common Christian heritage and
reject ``unnatural divisions'' splitting Europe into power blocs.
   John Paul, 68, was expected to expand on that theme during
speeches today to the Council of Europe and European Court of Human
Rights, and to the European Parliament on Tuesday. All three
institutions meet at the Palace of Europe in Strasbourg.
   His message comes at a time of sharp economic divisions among
the Common Market nations. The agreement by European Economic
Community members to fully integrate their economies in 1992 has
touched off widespread debate about whether Western Europe should
move toward becoming a single political unit.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain provoked protests
last month when she declared a U.S.-style European union would be
``highly damaging'' to the individual states.
   The pope's visit was timed so he could take part in the 2,000th
anniversary of Strasbourg. He also has scheduled visits to the
dioceses of Strasbourg, Metz and Nancy, all in the northeast near
West Germany.
   The Council of Europe is composed of 21 parliamentary
democracies that make up nearly all non-communist Europe. It aims
to coordinate European legislation through a series of accords and
to encourage unity, democracy and human rights.
   The 39-year-old organization has produced 110 conventions on
subjects ranging from terrorism to wildlife protection. The most
important of them is the European Convention on Human Rights.
   Unlike the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and its
judicial organs are not related to the European Economic Community,
or Common Market.

   Foreign journalists who were kicked and
clubbed by riot police while covering anti-government
demonstrations said they were intentionally attacked and filed a
complaint with the National Police.
   ``We were crouched behind a fruit stand _ not in the way and
trying to get out of the way'' Associated Press photographer John
Hopper said Friday evening after police fired water cannons and
tear gas, and then charged into a crowd of several hundred
demonstrators.
   ``We were clearly identified as press people,'' Hopper said.
``They ripped our gas masks off. I was blinded (by tear gas) and
could not see.''
   At least 12 journalists were injured Friday, including
Christopher Morris, a free-lance photographer for the U.S. magazine
Newsweek, and Liliana Nieto, a photographer for the Long Island
daily Newsday. Those two and at least three others were treated at
Santa Maria Clinica for head injuries.
   On Thursday evening, photographers Sergio Lainz and Daniel Bush
from the Spanish news agency EFE were beaten by riot police in
front of the Defense Ministry, toward which they ran to get away
from tear gas.
   The government issued large, pink press credentials to reporters
covering Wednesday's national referendum, in which President Gen.
Augusto Pinochet lost his bid to extend his term in office until
1997. His defeat sets the stage for balloting in December 1989 that
would be the first presidential election since Pinochet, 72, seized
power by coup in September 1973.
   However, opposition groups, buoyed by their victory, now are
demanding that elections be held sooner. Pinochet's blunt refusal
Thursday night has hardened public opposition to his rule.
   After the demonstrations about 50 foreign journalists walked to
a National Police station and filed a complaint.
   Other journalists injured Friday evening included Fred Thys, a
stringer for the U.S. television network CBS, and cameraman Ricardo
Correa and soundman Leopoldo Vidal. All three are based in Buenos
Aires, Argentina. Agence France Presse photographer Cristobal
Bouroncle Sedane also was injured.

   Several news reports say Anglican church
envoy Terry Waite and American hostages will soon be freed, but one
suggested Waite may be released only when Britain renews ties with
Syria.
   One of Friday's reports came from a new Israeli weekly, The
Nation, which published an unattributed story saying the United
States made a deal with Iran to free American hostages. It said the
agreement included delivery of weapons and spare parts to Iran
through South Korea.
   U.S. officials denied the report. They have said repeatedly they
will not bargain with the kidnappers and that no direct talks have
been held with Iran.
   A Beirut magazine, Ash-Shiraa, said Waite, missing since January
1987, will be freed with two other British hostages.
   It also quoted a security source as saying the release Monday of
Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian who is a resident U.S. alien, marked
``the beginning of the release of more American hostages'' before
the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8.
   Singh was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, at Beirut University College
with three Americans _ Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse
Turner. All four taught at the school.
   Steen's wife, Virginia-Rose, who returned to Beirut on Friday
from a summer trip to the United States, said today, ``We are
hopeful that all three will be released very soon.''
   Mrs. Steen, a fine arts professor at Beirut University College,
said she wanted to be in Beirut with the wives of Polhill and
Turner. Shiite extremists shun the kidnapping of women.
   Peggy Say, the sister of American Terry Anderson, the
longest-held foreign hostage, said in Lexington, Ky., Friday that
her brother will be ``devastated'' if his release is not obtained
by the Nov. 8 presidential election.
   Referring to information she received from a recently freed
hostage, Mrs. Say said: ``Terry is geared to the elections. He
feels it will take that to get him out of there. I'm afraid if they
come and go, it's going to be very devastating to him.'' Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Al-Anwar, a conservative daily newspaper based in Christian east
Beirut, quoted one unidentified source as saying Waite was moved
from the Bekaa valley to Beirut's southern suburbs and predicted he
would be freed within 72 hours.
   Another unidentified source, however, said he would be freed
when Britain restores diplomatic relations with Syria, Al-Anwar
reported. The Anglican church and British government said they had
no new information about Waite.
   Britain severed relations with Syria in November 1986, accusing
it of involvement in a plot to blow up an Israeli airliner.
   Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon and an ally of Iran,
has said it is working for release of all hostages held in Lebanon.
Most are believed to be in the hands of Shiite Moslems loyal to
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of Iran's fundamentalist
revolution.
   Both Beirut publications have been inaccurate in recent reports
about hostages. But Ash-Shiraa correctly revealed in November 1986
that the United States had secretly delivered arms to Iran,
shipments that gave rise to the Iran-Contra affair.
   The report about arms in The Nation said the U.S. government
also agreed to pay $7 million ransom to Shiite Moslem extremists
holding the hostages but refused their demand for immunity from
prosecution.
   Lebanese police said Friday two unidentified foreigners
kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut 21 months ago were Czechoslovak
businessmen held only a few days. The report leaves 14 foreigners
missing in Lebanon, including nine Americans.

<HEAD>Authorities Razing Chernobyl Town Because of Contamination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local authorities are razing the town of
Chernobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear power accident,
because its buildings will never be fit for human habitation,
Pravda said today.
   ``The radiation situation in Chernobyl is such that full life of
people cannot resume for decades,'' V. Komarov, chief engineer of
the nuclear power agency running the nearby Chernobyl power plant,
was quoted as saying.
   The town, which formerly had 10,000 residents, was evacuated in
April 1986 when a fire at the nuclear plant spewed radiation
worldwide. Officials said 31 people were killed.
   Authorities originally planned to tear down only dilapidated
houses, Komarov wrote in an article in the power plant newspaper
quoted by Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party's newspaper.
   But ``by the time normal life can return, all the houses will be
equally dilapidated and living in them will be impossible,'' he
said. ``In other words, there will be scarcely anything to preserve
at all!''
   Officials started by setting fire to one house and then
bulldozed two streets of homes in the center of the town, Pravda
said. Some of the buildings were just 3 years old.
   Pravda objected to the decision and pointed out that a similar
town, also 11 miles from the power plant, has been decontaminated
and repopulated.
   The revitalized town of Gden is in the Byelorussian republic
north of the Chernobyl power plant. The town of Chernobyl is in the
Ukraine.
   The area within six miles of the power plant is a preserve where
the effects of radiation on animals and plants is being studied.
Some workers come into the area on temporary duty, but no one is
allowed to live there.
   Pravda also reported that 994 people, mostly middle-aged and
elderly, have moved back into the Ukrainian section of the 18-mile
danger zone outside the uninhabitated ring.
   Reports this spring said 100 people returned to Chernobyl
itself, but Pravda said they were given no consideration in the
decision to raze the town.
   Gamma background radiation levels in Chernobyl were 0.1
milliroentgen per hour in June, equal to the natural radioactivity
in mountainous areas but twice that of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev,
south of Chernobyl, the newspaper said.

   Rioters and security forces fought in
the western port city of Oran, and diplomatic sources said today
that at least seven people were killed.
   The local headquarters of the governing party, the National
Liberation Front, and three of the largest hotels in the city were
gutted in the fighting Friday night, the sources said on condition
of anonymity. The Air France office in Oran was wrecked in
protests, the airline said in Paris.
   In the capital of Algiers, people returned to work under tight
military surveillance after four days of rioting that spurred the
government to declare a state of emergency and order troops to fire
on demonstrators. The rioting began over sharp price increases in
the government's austerity program.
   Rioters raided police commissaries in Algiers and Oran and
seized arms. There was no indication that the arms were being used
against security forces in Algiers, but in Oran, the country's
second-largest city, several of the dead were said to be policemen.
   Authorities have acknowledged deaths in the Algiers rioting, but
without providing details. The diplomatic sources said they did not
know how many people died in the Algiers clashes.
   Earlier unconfirmed reports said at least 12 people have died in
the unrest. Medical sources said more than 30 people were admitted
to a hospital. The military has reported 900 arrests in the
violence, which began Tuesday.
   Algiers, Oran and other major cities were patrolled today by a
large turnout of troops in full battle gear, with bayonets fixed to
their rifles. The army's tanks and armored personnel carriers stood
at most of the major intersections and in front of crucial
government offices in Algiers.
   Traffic resumed, but much lighter than normal for a Saturday, a
normal workday in Moslem Algeria. Algerians massed at bus stops,
but so many buses had been burned in the rioting that public
transit was almost nonexistent.
   Elementary and high schools remained closed, but universities
and government offices reopened with no reports of disturbances.
   State office workers tried to restore order in government
ministries where files were burned or thrown to the winds this week
in protests that began over the government's austerity program.
   Disturbances were reported Friday in several other provincial
centers, including Blida and Constantine.
   In the capital, Moslem fundamentalists defied a state of
emergency in a protest march Friday but dispersed without
confronting troops brought in to block the path.
   Although Algeria's economic woes underlie the protests, the
motives of different groups of demonstrators were often difficult
to sort out.
   The protests included youths chanting the names of their
favorite soccer clubs, fundamentalists urging transformation of
Algeria from a secular state into an Iranian-style Islamic
republic, and vandals causing destruction for no apparent reason.
   A military communique Friday warned that troops were ordered to
use arms against ``all those who refuse to obey immediately the
call to disperse quietly.'' It expanded the nightly curfew, which
now runs from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., instead of from midnight.
   On Thursday, President Chadli Bendjedid prohibited public
demonstrations and put police and civil administration under
military control.
   Algeria's austerity plan is aimed at resolving an economic
crisis made worse by the fall in the price of oil, the nation's
main source of revenue.
   Nearly 60 percent of Algerians are less than 20 years old.
Straining under a demographic explosion that has pushed the
population from 9.4 million in 1954 to 23.5 million today, the
country is trying to modernize its economy after years of a
strictly government-directed economy.

<HEAD>Former Presidential Candidate, Nine Others Found Guilty In Coup
Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury found a former presidential
candidate and nine other people guilty of plotting to overthrow the
government and kill President Samuel K. Doe.
   Circuit Judge George Tulay said he will announce the sentences
soon.
   The defendants included teacher Gabriel Kpolleh, who ran in the
1985 presidential election as a candidate of the now banned Liberia
Unification Party, and a former associate judge, Cpehas Mbandi.
   Defense lawyers objected to Friday evening's verdict saying they
had information of tampering with the 14-member jury during the
eight-week trial. Tulay said he will consider the objections when
he receives written complaints.
   Hundreds of relatives and sympathizers in the courtroom and
outside wept when the verdict was announced.
   The defendants were among 14 people indicted by a grand jury in
March on charges of plotting to assassinate Doe and replace his
government with a People's Reorganization Council. Four of those
indicted have not been arrested.
   Prosecution witnesses said the defendants met several times
between 1986 and March this year to discuss their plans and had a
cache of grenades, rifles and ammunition to use in the takeover.
   Several attempts have been made to oust Doe, a former army
master sergeant, since he overthrew the government of William
Tolbert in 1980 and killed the civilian leader.
   More than 600 people were killed during a Nov. 12, 1985 coup
attempt, which followed elections that opposition leaders said were
rigged.
   In July, Doe said a 12-man invading force led by his former
second in command, Maj.-Gen. Nicholas Podier Jr., was intercepted
at the border with Ivory Coast, Liberia's eastern neighbor.
   Podier and four companions died in a firefight with Liberian
security men. Two Americans _ Curtis Williams, 45, of Jersey City,
N.J., and James Bush, 40, of Baltimore _ have been charged with
treason for their alleged role in the Podier plot to overthrow the
government.
   The West African nation was founded in 1847 by freed American
slaves.

<HEAD>Soviet Weekly Details Stalin-Era Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet weekly published an unusually detailed
account of a massacre in the Stalin era in which police lined more
than 100,000 people along ditches, gagged them and shot them,
sometimes using one bullet for two people.
   Although the 29-year reign of dictator Josef Stalin has recently
been fiercely criticized in the Soviet press, few articles have
gone as far as the Moscow News account of the massacre at Kuropaty,
near Minsk, in the 1930s.
   ``Gunshots resounded night and day, winter and summer, and there
were also cries ... prayers and moans,'' Moscow News wrote in an
article entitled ``Kuropaty, the Human Tragedy About Which Everyone
Must Know.''
   It said the police confronted a woodsman who saw freshly dug
mass graves and abandoned personal belongings near the killing site
and told him, ``See less, if you want to live.''
   The story in this week's issue combined personal accounts from
people who lived around the site with reports from recent
excavations to piece together what happened at Kuropaty.
   Men and women branded ``enemies of the people'' under Stalin
were brought alongside the newly dug ditches and made to stand in
rows, the paper said. They were then gagged and shot, it said.
   In some cases, the victims were made to stand so that one bullet
would kill two people, Moscow News said.
   For the NKVD secret police, who carried out the executions,
``this was their brand of bravado, of sport, a show of
professionalism,'' the paper said.
   Zenon Poznyak, an archaeologist who wrote the Moscow News story,
said the number of people buried at Kuropaty was estimated at
102,000 at the very least.
   ``However, the actual number of victims must be higher,''
Poznyak wrote.
   Moscow News and another weekly, Ogonyok, previously reported
that Soviet authorities after World War II tried to cover up what
happened at Kuropaty.
   As a result of the recent publicity, the Byelorussian
prosecutor's office has opened a criminal investigation into the
massacres, but state-run media have never said who might be
prosecuted or for what.

<HEAD>Leading British Writers Protest Indian Ban On Novel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six people, including playwright Tom Stoppard and
novelist Kingsley Amis, have signed a telegram to Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi protesting the country's ban on Salman
Rushdie's new novel.
   The novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was banned by India's
Ministry of Finance after Moslem members of Parliament found the
book offensive to Islam.
   The complicated story, which mixes elements of realism and
fantasy, focuses on two Indian characters. The benevolent one acts
as a messenger for Mohammed, the founder of the Islamic religion.
The other is satanic and manipulative.
   Rushdie, 41, responded to the ban in a statement issued by Index
on Censorship, a British-based journal on issues of free speech
around the world.
   ``I feel very shocked by the news,'' the Bombay-born novelist
said. ``For India to describe itself, as it frequently does, as the
world's largest democracy is clearly incompatible with the act of
banning a work of literature.
   ``I very much hope that good sense can prevail and that this
decision can speedily be reversed so that Indian readers might have
a chance to judge the book for themselves,'' said Rushdie, whose
previous novels include ``Shame'' and ``Midnight's Children.''
   The protest telegram, which was sent Friday, said:
   ``We consider that the banning of a serious work of literature
represents a very grave threat to freedom of expression in your
country, and strongly urge you to ensure that the ban is lifted.''
   The other signers were poet Stephen Spender; Philip Spender and
Sally Laird, the director and editor, respectively, of Index on
Censorship; and Kevin Boyle, director of Article 19, a second
anti-censorship organization.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' was published Sept. 22 in Britain to
generally good reviews. It has been nominated for London's
prestigious Booker Prize, which will be announced Oct. 25.

<TEXT>
   A plane carrying 46 people on a sightseeing trip
crashed into a hotel and exploded in northern China, killing 42
passengers and injuring the other four, an official daily said
today.
   The China Youth News said an unspecified number of workers in
the hotel also sustained injuries in the accident Friday in the
city of Linfen, Shanxi province, 400 miles southwest of Beijing.
   The paper said the passengers on the Soviet-built Ilyushin Il-14
transport plane were employees of a local knitting factory. They
had paid $4.30 each for the 15-minute air tour of the region.
   The daily said the plane went down one minute after takeoff,
crashing into the roof of the Xinqiao Hotel. Four passengers
managed to escape seconds before the plane exploded. The four crew
members were all killed.
   The sightseeing service, operated by a local air company, had
begun on Oct. 1, China's National Day.
   Wang Shichang, director of the knitting factory and one of the
four on board who survived, said his group had seen a television
report on the sightseeing flight and decided to take it ``as we
have earned a lot of money recently. We never imagined we would
have this disaster.''
   It was the second major plane accident of the year in China.
   The other involved the crash of a Soviet-designed Ilyushin Il-18
four-engine turboprop operated by the national airways CAAC in
January that killed 108 near the southwest China city of Chungking.
   In August another CAAC jetliner skidded off the runway at Hong
Kong airport and plunged into the harbor, killing six crew members
and one passenger.

<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has been sentenced to life in
prison after tearfully pleading guilty in a plea bargain agreement
to taking 110 children and adults hostage at a private school.
   James L. Harvey, 43, at his sisters' encouragement, pleaded
guilty Friday to one count of first-degree kidnapping and five
counts of second-degree kidnapping in the Feb. 2 takeover of West
End Christian School in Tuscaloosa.
   The plea cut short testimony in Harvey's trial, which had been
moved to Huntsville because of pretrial publicity.
   Circuit Judge John M. Karrh sentenced Harvey to one life term
and five 20-year terms, to be served concurrently. He said he would
recommend that Harvey get psychiatric help in prison.
   ``I think you need treatment,'' Karrh told the weeping Harvey,
who had maintained during the 12-hour siege and during his trial,
which began Wednesday, that he was exercising his constitutional
right to bear arms and was making a statement for the nation's
homeless, poor and illiterate.
   Before pleading guilty, Harvey, who had defended himself during
the trial, sat at the defense table and cried while he signed a
form that said he understood his rights.
   The original 110 kidnapping charges carried a maximum sentence
of up to 10,000 years. The charges were combined into six amended
counts after he agreed during negotiations Thursday night and
Friday to stop fighting the charges.
   Two older sisters, Doris Elliott and Martha Gray of Tuscaloosa,
took part in the talks.
   ``He is mentally and physically exhausted,'' Mrs. Gray said.
``I've thought all along that he needed mental help. I love him and
I want him well. ...
   ``All I wanted from the beginning was for him to get some help,
but he didn't agree until this morning that he needed help.''
   The trial's end saves Gov. Guy Hunt from having to testify.
Harvey had summoned him as a defense witness because the governor's
videotape of a bogus pardon had persuaded Harvey to put aside his
three high-powered guns and walk out of the school building exactly
12 hours after he and another man had entered the school.
   The other man, John Rhodes Jr., emerged during the afternoon of
the siege and also was charged with kidnapping but later was freed
after authorities determined that Harvey had tricked him into
helping him.

   Investigators are looking for the source
of poison found in a package of Sunkist Fun Fruits and Dinosaurs
candy that has resulted in the candies being pulled from store
shelves in northern New Jersey.
   A woman discovered the poison, strychnine, after her 4-year-old
son ate some of the candy, which was purchased at a grocery store,
Bergen County prosecutor Larry McClure said at a news conference
Friday.
   The boy showed the candy to his mother and she noticed the
powdery coating. State police tests completed Friday identified the
substance.
   The boy did not become ill or need hospitalization, McClure
said. He said he did not know if any other contaminated boxes were
distributed.
   ``Information we have from interviews with the housewife and her
family (show) ... it (the poison) was more than likely (added)
during the manufacturing process or before packaging,'' McClure
said.
   Henry Heide Co. in New Brunswick made the candy for the Lipton
Co., which packaged and distributed the boxes under the Sunkist
label, McClure said.
   McClure said the prosecutor's office contacted the Lipton Co.,
which has cooperated in the investigation. He said they had not yet
contacted Heide.
   There was no immediate comment from the Heide company. A
production superviser, who refused to give his name, said he had
not heard about the contaminated candy. He said he would pass
messages to company officials. Other calls for comment were not
answered.
   Curt Anderson, a vice president for public affairs with Sunkist
in Sherman Oaks, Calif., told The Star-Ledger of Newark that the
case appears to be isolated, but that the boxes were pulled off
shelves as a precaution.
   McClure said the number on the outside of the box is 8H04EF. The
batch was packaged Aug. 4 and distributed in an area ranging from
Massachusetts to Florida and west to Ohio, McClure said.
   Lipton provided the distribution areas to the prosecutor, who
said he could not be more specific on states or stores.
   All the candy was being taken off the shelves in northern New
Jersey and authorities in potentially affected areas were notified,
McClure said.
   McClure would not identify the mother or child.
   Strychnine, commonly used in rodent killer, may cause death in
small doses or can cause violent convulsions, loss of muscle
control, intense pain and impaired respiration, McClure said.

   About 2,000 people _ most of them silent, some
sobbing quietly _ braved near-freezing temperatures early today to
open a display on the Ellipse behind the White House of a massive
quilt memorializing AIDS victims on the Ellipse behind the White
House.
   ``It's a beautiful thing but it's built on corpses,'' said Cleve
Jones, who opened an 11-hour rite in which 495 people, including
entertainers and Kitty Dukakis, were to read all 8,288 names
embroidered and painted on the quilt's panels.
   ``I guess the main thing I'm feeling this morning is anger,''
said Jones, who made the first 3-foot by 6-foot panel after the
death of his friend in 1986 from AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. He said he was angry most at President Reagan.
   ``At this point it's a little late for Mr. Reagan to do
anything,'' Jones said. ``He should have understood many years ago
that a new and deadly virus has emerged and that it was time to
take some action.''
   Jones said Reagan had many opportunities to act, including when
former Rep. Stewart McKinney, R-Conn., ``or his friend Rock
Hudson'' died from AIDS.
   As the names of the AIDS victims resounded over the address
system, Mayer and Pat Levy of St. Louis, whose 31-year-old son died
last year, silently waited their turn to read their list.
   ``We're doing this in memory of our son _ to help others,'' Levy
said tearfully, noting that the quilt would help parents ``releive
their grief and acknowledge that their son was gay and passed
away.''
   Others, like Chris Bates of Washington just cried.
   `I knew all of these people in New York, San Francisco and
Washington,'' Bates said. ``They were my contemporaries. I'm not 40
yet and all I talk about now is death _ my grandmother talks about
death _ it's not right.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, wife of Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis, was scheduled to read later today some of the names of the
victims listed on the quilt, which is the size of nearly seven
football fields.
   Among others scheduled to read the names of victims were Rep.
Gerry Studds, D-Mass., and actresses Shirley MacLaine, Sigourney
Weaver and Elizabeth McGovern.
   Construction of the quilt began in 1986 after project executive
director Cleve Jones made the first panel for a friend who died of
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Since it was first displayed in the capital last year, the quilt
has more than quadrupled in size, from 1,920 panels to 8,800.
   At its present size, it represents more than one-fifth of the
approximately 42,000 Americans known to have died of AIDS since
June 1981.
   The framework for the display, complete with 16 miles of canvas
walkway and trim arranged to allow an expected 250,000 spectators a
closer view of the quilt's panels, was laid out Friday.
   Many of the volunteers, such as Boston's Julie Kaufman, became
involved with the project after a friend died of the disease.
   Travel kits, T-shirts, posters and a book about the life stories
behind the panels are among items being sold to defray the cost of
bringing the massive display to the capital.
   Panels not on the Ellipse will be on display around the city at
various AIDS support group centers. American Red Cross headquarters
here has an exhibit of photographs of AIDS victims.
   Debra Resnik, who managed a 20-city tour for the quilt, said
public reaction has been strong.
   ``There was such an outpouring of relief, of pain,'' she said.
``Especially when we went to cities like Kansas City, New Orleans,
Baltimore, the really sheltered places where (friends and relatives
of AIDS victims) are so alone. You have a place to go, to carry
your grief.''
   Former actor Barry Singer, who has AIDS, agreed that the quilt
offers a chance to humanize the statistics. But he said it provokes
a number of emotions, including anger.
   ``There wouldn't have to be a quilt if there would have been
government intervention,'' he said. ``It is now up to the people to
realize that it is no longer and never really has been just the gay
community dying from AIDS.''

   Flying bullets forced firefighters to take
cover when an ammunition manufacturing company caught fire and
exploded, killing four people, authorities said.
   Investigators from the state Fire Marshal's Office and the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms worked today to
determine what caused the fire and explosions Friday at the Buffalo
Rock Shooters Supply, seven miles west of this north-central
Illinois town.
   The company makes ammunition and sells weapons to police
departments around the country, authorities said.
   ``I've seen explosions before, but nothing like this. It was
just so massive,'' La Salle County Coroner Marion Osborne said.
   ``It was a big ball of fire with a couple of explosions. There
were a lot of bullets flying,'' said Vince Dettore, fire chief of
Naplate, a town about four miles east of the factory.
   Dettore said workers at the company were believed to have been
making bullets when the first explosion hit about 11:30 a.m. in the
main building, which also housed the company's general offices and
gun shop.
   The official cause was unknown, but fire investigators suspect a
spark may have ignited gunpowder.
   ``It started in the main building where they make ammunition and
sell guns,'' Dettore said. ``A place like that with all that black
powder _ just the dust, if you get a spark in there that's all it's
going to take. They had cases and cases and cases of all kinds of
ammunition, all kinds of guns.''
   Bullets were whizzing through the air when firefighters arrived
at the complex, which also included three ammunition and gun
storage buildings, Dettore said.
   ``It's not as dangerous as if it was shot out of a gun itself,''
the fire chief said. ``It gets a little scarey when you get a big
explosion.
   ``We started putting it out until we were told there was black
powder in there and then I evacuated all of the men out,'' Dettore
said.
   He said the 40 firefighters retreated about a half-mile from the
complex for 45 minutes and then resumed battling the blaze.
   The victims, company owner Roger Fulmer, 53, of Ottawa; his
stepdaughter, Patti Smith, 32, of Utica; Pamela Ellsworth, 26, of
Wedron; and Ronea Scamen, 31, of Ottawa, were identified through
dental records, said Osborne.

   The government of Montenegro offered
its resignation to the republic's Parliament today after
club-wielding riot police clashed with thousands of protesters,
official media reported.
   The demonstrators in Titograd, the republic's capital, were
demanding the immediate removal of the local Communist leadership,
the state-run Tanjug news agency said. Montenegrin party leaders
held an emergency session to discuss the demand and tensions in the
region.
   Police dispersed the protesters in the latest clash in a growing
wave of economic and ethnic unrest in Yugoslavia's six republics
and two autonoous provinces. This was believed to be the first time
police used force.
   Tanjug said 23 demonstrators were detained for making
unspecified ``public hostile declarations,'' but most were later
released.
   About 10 protesters were injured, said a source in Titograd who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Tanjug said several demonstrators
were injured but did not provide figures.
   In Belgrade, the national capital, the ruling Communist Party
Presidium met today to discuss the developments in Montenegro.
   More than 20,000 people crowded into a square in the city late
Friday and stayed there all night, defying repeated police attempts
to disperse and demanding the ouster of the Communist Party
leadership, witnesses said.
   ``You betrayed us,'' chanted the crowd in Titograd, 280 miles
southwest of Belgrade. ``We want bread. Our children are hungry.''
   The flag-waving, emotional crowd tried several times to force
its way into the Parliament building but were prevented by police
and riot squads.
   At about 7 a.m., riot police charged with clubs, pushing the
crowd into a nearby park, Tanjug said.
   A police spokesman who demanded anonymity said police intervened
because of ``nationalistic, vulgar and hostile speeches'' delivered
by several people during the overnight meeting. He said police and
the town's authorities ``will not allow the continuation of the
rally because it has been abused by individuals to deliver hostile
slogans.''
   The mayor of Titograd, which has 150,000 inhabitants, has
announced his resignation, Tanjug said.
   The rally began after 1,000 construction workers went on strike
Friday to protest low wages and falling living standards.
   The Titograd protest was one of several demonstrations in
Yugoslavia that began Friday. On Thursday, 30,000 people surrounded
a government building in the province of Vojvodina, battling police
and eventually forcing the resignations of the 15-member provincial
Politburo.
   National Communist Party leaders tried to quell the growing
strife by promising changes in leadership.
   The ruling national Presidium issued a statement Friday saying
the policy-making Central Committee plenum to meet Oct. 17 ``will
make necessary personnel changes'' to deal with the crisis.
   A growing number of Yugoslavians have called for a top-level
shake-up as the unrest continues. The public protests stem from the
country's worst economic crisis in its history and long-simmering
feuds between ethnic groups.
   Communist leaders have been blamed for failing to defuse
tensions between the mostly Christian Slav minority and the largely
Moslem ethnic Albanian majority in the southern Kosovo province in
the republic of Serbia.
   The Presidium statement appealed for urgent changes in the
country's political and economic system to help resolved the crisis
over growing labor unrest, a 217 percent annual inflation and a $21
billion foreign debt.

   Police seized cocaine and marijuana worth nearly
$12 million and arrested several people in two major drug raids,
Scotland Yard said.
   Two tons of marijuana, with an estimated value of $10.2 million,
were confiscated Friday morning after a raid on a home in Harlow,
24 miles north of London.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
``number of people'' were being questioned by police on allegations
they attempted to distribute the drug.
   Drug officers found 17 pounds of cocaine worth $1.7 million on
Thursday in two east London homes, the spokeswoman said.

   The 70 employees at the Eiffel Tower went on strike
Saturday for higher pay, preventing tourists from entering the most
famous site in France.
   The employees asked to meet with top management of the tower,
which is a communications transmission station as well as a tourist
attraction, to press their demand for a raise of 31 cents per hour.
The current base wage is $4.55 an hour.
   The Eiffel Tower is 984 feet high and has elevators to take
tourists to three observation levels. When it opened in 1888, it
was the world's tallest structure.

   Alitalia, Italy's national air carrier, canceled
dozens of domestic and international flights Saturday during a
six-hour strike by pilots, flight attendants, technicians and
ground personnel.
   A specially outfitted DC-9 of the Alitalia fleet, with Pope John
Paul II aboard, took off from Rome's Leonardo da Vinci Airport just
as the strike began. He was beginning a four-day visit to France.
   Airport officials said only domestic flights linking the
mainland to Sicily and Sardinia took off and landed regularly
during the work stoppage. Flights to Canada and the United States
were postponed until the strike ended at 2 p.m. Foreign carriers
were not involved.
   The strikers were protesting proposed budget cuts for the
airport administration and other services that they contend will
give them more work.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Not Much Attention on Classroom Substance</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One in a series of stories on major issues in the
presidential race</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Election Day nears, education remains at
best a marginal issue in the 1988 campaign _ the stuff of political
rhetoric and modest promises, but not a cutting-edge issue for
either candidate.
   More attention has been paid to whether teachers should be
compelled to lead the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of each
school day than to what students learn after that patriotic ritual.
   George Bush has said repeatedly he wants to go down in history
as ``the education president.'' The Republican candidate tells
voters wherever he goes that better schools are the key to a better
future for America.
   Michael Dukakis, too, avers that he wants to be ``the education
president.'' The Democrat gets big cheers every time he promises,
``We're going to make teaching a valued and honored profession
again.''
   Whichever candidate wins on Nov. 8, educators are confident the
education budget will be in safer hands under the next president
than under Ronald Reagan.
   But they say neither Bush, who attended private schools as a
youngster, nor Dukakis, who attended public schools, has done
enough to dramatize the problems facing American schools or to
spell out a convincing plan to improve performance.
   Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, said, ``We hear strong inspirational
statements about how important education is, but the direction the
`education president' would take is still not clear.''
   At the outset of the campaign, ``the candidates were stumbling
all over themselves to say this was America's most urgent
obligation,'' said Boyer. ``It faded as a central issue.''
   Richard Berendzen, president of The American University in
Washington, said, ``I grade both on what I hear and what I don't
hear. ... I'd give both a D-plus.''
   Berendzen said 25 percent of American young people drop out of
high school and 20 percent grow up in poverty, and the United
States is far back on international scholastic tests.
   ``If you take a sober look at the matter, you could say that the
preparation of our youth today and workforce readiness for the year
2000 is one of the two or three top issues facing America,'' said
Berendzen.
   Despite the generalities, said College Board President Donald M.
Stewart, ``It is obvious both candidates are making the link
between economic productivity and international competitiveness and
the underserved, undereducated poor.''
   However, Dennis Doyle, a Hudson Institute scholar, said it is
inevitable that education will slip to the back of the president's
agenda.
   ``Education is 15th or 20th on the real list the president will
actually keep, as apart from a campaign list,'' said Doyle. ``The
deficit, defense, international relations, economic problems, even
health care, Social Security, transportation and housing all are
higher on their priority list.''
   Both candidates have outlined ways to help families cope with
the soaring costs of college _ Bush with a tax-free savings bond
plan, and Dukakis with a new loan program that students would repay
through payroll deductions.
   Bush, whose administration tried to cut $5 billion from the
Education Department last year, actually has proposed bigger
spending increases than his rival.
   Here are their major education proposals:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ $500 million for a ``merit schools'' program that would reward
schools that raise the academic scores of disadvantaged students.
Schools would get up to $100,000 each to spend as they saw fit.
   _ $50 million for matching grants to create more ``magnet''
schools that emphasize various academic subjects.
   _ Expanding from $12 million to $50 million a proposed Fund for
Innovation and Reform of Schools and Teaching to give each state $1
million for an experimental district trying such concepts as
parental choice, merit pay or year-round schools.
   _ Money for Head Start, the $1.2 billion pre-school program for
disadvantaged children, would be ``sharply increased'' by an
unspecified amount. Bush said he is committed to building Head
Start ``to a level where all eligible 4-year-olds can attend
classes.'' The Children's Defense Fund says the 453,000 children
now in Head Start are only 16 percent of those eligible.
   Bush has also promised to spend more on Chapter 1, a $4.6
billion remedial program that serves about 55 percent of eligible
poor students.
   _ Tax-free U.S. Savings Bonds for college tuition. This would
eventually cost the Treasury $200 million a year; the tax break
would be phased out for families earning $60,000 to $80,000 or
above.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ $250 million for a National Teaching Excellence Fund to
provide college scholarships and forgive loans for those who become
teachers, launch a new National Teacher Corps, create state teacher
retraining centers, recruit retirees to teach, and support a
five-fold expansion of a $1.9 million Christa McAuliffe Fellowship
program for talented teachers.
   _ $25 million for a ``Citizens Literacy Corps'' to support
volunteer efforts to teach illiterates to read.
   _ A Student Tuition and Repayment System (STARS) allowing
students to pay back college loans through payroll deductions in
their working years. It would supplement, not replace, existing
federal grants and loans, at least at the start. Students would get
STARS loans from banks.
   Dukakis officials have suggested a payback rate of one-eighth to
one-quarter of 1 percentage point of earnings per $1,000 borrowed,
meaning a tax of 2.5 to 5 percent for a $20,000 borrower.
   The rate stays the same for low- and high-income earners, but
the loan is never paid off.

<TEXT>
   On June 14, 1985, Robert Stethem
and five fellow U.S. Navy divers were flying back from a project in
Greece, looking forward to seeing family and friends in the United
States.
   The next day, Stethem, a bullet in his head, was pushed out of
the plane and died on the tarmac of the Beirut Airport.
   Witnesses at the trial of confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi
have been giving a Frankfurt court a gut-wrenching account of the
slaying of the 23-year-old Maryland man who hoped to make a career
in the Navy but who became the only person killed in the hijacking
of TWA Flight 847.
   The court has not ruled on the facts of the case, but the
witnesses and official accounts have made possible a reconstruction
of Stethem's last hours.
   Shortly after the Boeing 727 leaves Athens, some passengers hear
a commotion from the rear of the jetliner as two Shiite Moslem
gunmen run screaming down the aisle, brandishing a hand grenade and
a chrome-plated pistol.
   ``Americans die, come to die!'' passenger Kurt Carlson hears the
gunmen shouting at the 145 passengers and eight crew members at
about 10 a.m.
   Clinton Suggs, stationed in Norfolk, Va., wakes his Navy buddy,
Stethem, from a short nap.
   ``This should be interesting,'' Stethem says.
   Stethem is dressed casually in a checkered shirt and slacks. He
has traded in the long hair he sported at Thomas Stone High School
in Waldorf, Md., near Washington for the close-cropped haircut more
suited to underwater welding.
   Hamadi and his accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine, quickly round up
passports and single out the U.S. military personnel.
   The military men are hustled up to the first-class section,
where a language difficulty fueled Hamadi's notion that Stethem is
a U.S. Marine and therefore the object of particular hate.
   Stethem is tied up with elastic baggage straps, and the first in
a long series of beatings begins. Sometimes they are just a few
feet from pilot John Testrake of Richmond, Mo., and the two other
men in the cockpit.
   At one point, Stethem complains about his bonds and shouts,
``It's too tight, it's too tight!''
   Hamadi, who records show has just turned 21, responds: ``Let the
pig suffer.''
   Stethem's shouts are heard throughout the jetliner as it
approaches Beirut airport.
   One hijacker beats Stethem with an armrest torn from a seat, the
sharp metal screws still pointing out. When Stethem collapses
nearly unconscious, one of the hijackers jumps up and down on his
ribs, leaving his chest a mass of black-and-blue marks.
   ``Marine, Marine!'' the tormentors scream, apparently recalling
the U.S. Marine presence in Lebanon in 1983.
   They beat Stethem again after authorities at Beirut airport
delay refueling the airliner. Stethem, barely able to walk, is
helped back to the coach section.
   That's when he meets up again with Ruth Henderson, an Australian
teen-ager who chatted with Stethem at the Athens airport.
   Stethem is crying. Several ribs are broken and one hand is
completely numb as he sits next to the girl.
   Ruth helps Stethem eat because he is unable to feed himself. The
unmarried diver, barely able to talk, tells Ruth he hopes that if
anyone has to die he will be the one since his Navy buddies on the
flight are all married.
   The plane heads to Algeria early that same Friday afternoon.
After the four-hour flight, the hijackers savagely beat Army
Reserve officer Carlson of Rockford, Ill., and leave him for dead
during tense negotiations for more jet fuel.
   In the evening, the hijackers order the plane back to Beirut.
Stethem is brought back to the front of the airplane and the
beating resumes. The plane lands early the next morning: Saturday,
June 15, 1985.
   When negotiations with the tower in Beirut erupt into a
screaming match, one of the hijackers shouts, ``Get up! Get up!''
to Stethem. His head leaves a huge red imprint of blood on the
aircraft's side.
   Stethem and Suggs are bound and blindfolded.
   Sometime after 2:30 a.m. in Beirut, the hijackers pull the
curtain on the first-class section. The stunned passengers and crew
hear one shot _ possibly more.
   When the bullet pierces his head behind the right ear and exits
on the other side of his head, Stethem exhales so loudly the
passengers and crew hear it above the whining of the jet engines.
   ``My God, they have shot someone,'' chief flight attendant Uli
Derickson says.
   The hijackers toss Stethem, still moaning, out the passenger
exit and down onto the runway where he lives for about 10 minutes.
   His body is taken to the morgue at the American University
hospital in Beirut.
   Hamadi has denied pulling the trigger and said it was the work
of his accomplice.
   But Stethem's supervisor, Navy diver Stuart Dahl, also stationed
in Norfolk, Va., said Hamadi gloated over the slaying.
   ``He was proud of it,'' Dahl testified. ``He looked like the fox
that got the chicken. He showed absolutely no remorse.''

   The government said it is replacing the
president's 22-year-old plane because the jet suffered a ``serious
breakdown'' with President Miguel de La Madrid and six Cabinet
members on board.
   The new jet is a $49 million Boeing 757-225, which the
government bought in February and then tried to unload because of
strong public protest over the price tag.
   A statement released Friday night by de la Madrid's office said
the incident with the old jet, a 22-year-old Boeing 727, occurred
Sept. 17 during takeoff at the Cozumel airport. De la Madrid had
been there surveying damage to the resort caused by Hurricane
Gilbert.
   The Boeing 727 ``suffered a serious breakdown that put in danger
the security of the President of the Republic and his companions,
among whom were six Cabinet secretaries,'' the statement said. It
did not provide additional details.
   ``It must be noted that the heads or representatives of the
judicial and legislative powers frequently travel with the
president, as do foreign guests and even chiefs of state or
government from other countries,'' the statement said in explaining
the decision to keep the new aircraft.
   According to the statement, the government had been trying to
sell the new jet but didn't get any decent offers, despite
promoting the sale in more than 60 countries.

   Five elementary school girls walking home
from a party were killed when a speeding car careened off a utility
pole and onto a sidewalk, authorities said.
   Police Chief Reed Woodward said today no alcohol was involved in
the accident. He said the driver was a diabetic but authorities
were uncertain whether that played a role in the crash. Police were
investigating reports that he may have had a seizure.
   He said the car may have been out of control for 1,500 feet.
   ``We do know that the vehicle was traveling at a high rate of
speed,'' Woodward said. ``This must have happened just incredibly
fast for these kids not to get out of the way.''
   He identified the five pedestrians killed as Nicole Watia, 12,
and Laura Karcz, Jessica McKeefry, Brenda Hylok and Jodi Prokop,
all 13. The girls were all from Pulaski or its outskirts.
   The car hit a tree after it struck the girls, police said. The
driver, Scott C. Karcz, 17, and his sister, a passenger, were taken
to Green Bay hospitals and underwent surgery this morning. Both
were in critical condition today, authorities said. He is a distant
relative of victim Laura Karcz, Woodward said.
   The community is a rural village of 1,875 about 15 miles
northwest of Green Bay.
   Because of the tragedy, the high school canceled today's
football game, Principal Guy David said.
   ``The entire community is in a state of shock,'' David said.
``This is going to be a real problem for the community to deal
with. In a small community like this, everybody knows everybody.''
   Phil Rusniak, 70, who lives near the crash site, said he was
eating supper when he heard the accident outside his home.
   ``Everything was laying out in the street. It's terrible,''
Rusniak said.
   Jerome Karcz, the father of the driver, told WFRV-TV in Green
Bay that his son and daughter were returning to the high school to
get their textbooks when the accident occurred.
   A bomb threat had been made at the school Friday and officials
dismissed students early, authorities said. No explosives were
found and children were permitted back into the school to pick up
belongings.

<HEAD>Governing Party Blasts Opposition Officials For Joining Radical
Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party sharply criticized
opposition parties Saturday after secretaries of some opposition
lawmakers helped radical students seize the office of a federal
legislator.
   Prosecutor-general Lee Jong-nam ordered a probe of the clash, in
which some opposition officials attacked police with broken
ashtrays, flowerpots and fire extinguishers and shouted slogans.
   ``It is a clear case of blocking the execution of official
duties by police. All opposition secretaries and officials found
involved will be arrested and punished,'' Lee said.
   Twenty-three radical students were arrested for seizing the
office of Chung Ho-yang, a former defense minister and now a
ranking member of the governing Democratic Justice Party. The
incident occurred Thursday.
   The students were demanding the arrest of former President Chun
Doo-hwan and his wife for alleged corruption. Chun left office in
Feburary.
   The governing party ran huge advertisements in almost all daily
newspapers on Saturday, condemning the attack as an open challenge
to democratic development. The ads said the attackers were
``leftist radicals'' trying to overthrow the government.
   The three main opposition parties said the government was
overreacting in an effort to take attention away from allegations
of corruption during Chun's rule. A parliamentary investigation is
focusing on the allegations.
   Roh succeeded Chun after winning presidential elections in
December. Opposition officials charge that Roh is reluctant to
divulge wrongdoing by his predecessor.
   The dispute appeared to end a short truce between the government
and opposition parties during the Olympics, which ended Oct. 2.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 15 grafs with Bush, Bentsen remarks, picking

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, concluding a week of attacks on Democrat
Michael Dukakis' stands on crime, accepted the endorsement of the
head of a national police group today, then said in answer to
reporters' questions that he has not been trying to distance
himself from running mate Dan Quayle.
   Bush said he was getting ``a little tired of erroneous reporting
out there'' that has noted his relative lack of comment on Quayle
since Wednesday night's vice presidential debate, which polls show
most people thought Quayle lost to Democrat Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``This concept that I see in some of these reports that I am not
supportive of Dan Quayle are absolutely ludicrous,'' he said.
``They are ridiculous. He did well in that debate. He has my full
support ... and I made a good decision'' in selecting the Indiana
senator as running mate.
   Bush commented in Washington after accepting the endorsement of
Dewey Stokes, president of the National Fraternal Order of Police.
A news release from the Bush campaign emphasized the 197,000-person
membership of the organization, but Stokes acknowledged he was only
giving his personal support, not that of the group, which has not
taken a position on the race.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, was heading for Maine today, after a speech
Friday in which he stood in a Missouri auto parts plant owned by
Italians and attacked foreign ownership of American firms.
   Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said
today in Texas he wouldn't let the Republicans concentrate only on
Bush and keep the spotlight off Dan Quayle, the GOP running mate
whom Bentsen debated Wednesday night.
   He said the GOP had made a mistake in choosing ``a candidate
that the imagemakers and the poll takers thought could be packaged
and sold to the American people.''
   As for Dukakis' speech Friday, campaign aides, moving quickly to
say that he was not criticizing any company in particular,
acknowledged that he didn't know the Moog Automotive Inc. plant in
suburban St. Louis had foreign owners.
   ``If anyone asks you what's at stake in this election, just
remind them of that moment in the debate Wednesday night when
Senator Quayle said he's happy that foriegn owners are buying up
America,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Maybe the Republican ticket wants our children to work for
foreign owners, pay rent to foreign owners, and owe their future to
foreign owners _ but that's not the kind of future Lloyd Bentsen
and I and (Missouri Rep.) Dick Gephardt want for America,'' he
continued.
   The Moog family sold the company more than 10 years ago to IFINT
USA, the American subsidiary of IFI of Turin, Italy. IFI is owned
by the Agnelli family, which also owns the automaker Fiat.
   Dukakis later said of the incident, ``It was not a faux pas.''
   The candidates made their rounds as sponsors of next week's
second and final presidential debate said the event would be held
Thursday or Friday night on the UCLA campus in Los Angeles
beginning at 9 p.m. EDT. The 90-minute encounter will be televised
nationally.
   Bush, who has made Massachusetts' former prison furlough program
the centerpiece of his soft-on-crime attack against Dukakis, has
been criticized by the Dukakis camp for making such charges when he
is vice president of the federal government which also has a
furlough program.
   ``There's no question that the federal furlough program should
be reviewed,'' Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller told reporters
on Friday. ``We talked about it today. ... George Bush would have
his attorney general do that.''
   Fuller said the Repbulican candidate had no specific proposal to
revise the current law and that Bush was satisfied it is
``fundamentally different'' from the Massachusetts law that granted
a weekend furlough in 1986 to convicted murderer Willie Horton.
   In a campaign speech Friday in Xenia, Ohio, Bush charged that
Dukakis as Massachusetts governor ``relented'' and repealed the law
that let murderers go on weekend furlough ``under the bright
spotlight of the national presidential campaign.''
   In some of the harshest language he has used to describe Dukakis
as soft on crime, Bush accused his rival of having compassion for
criminals but ``an astounding lack of sensitivity'' for crime
victims.
   With one month to go to the election, the polls continued to
show Bush a step ahead in the race for the White House. Democrats
were hoping that other polls rating Bentsen as the winner of the
vice presidential debate would serve as prelude to a shift in the
presidential race itself.
   GOP vice presidential candidate Quayle laughed at that, as he
shrugged off Democratic campaign commercials aimed at raising
doubts about his fitness for high office.
   ``We can stand the heat. We're going to stay in the kitchen.
George Bush is going to be the next president of the United States.
The voters will vote for him,'' the Indiana senator said as he
campaigned in Tennessee.
   Bentsen chipped in on the Democratic anti-Quayle barrage, saying
it was an ``incredible misfit'' for his vice presidential rival to
compare his own experience in Congress with John Kennedy's before
the 1960 election. Quayle's self-comparison produced the most
riveting moment of the debate, when Bentsen turned to him and said,
``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''

   The space shuttle
Discovery left its landing site today atop a jumbo jet for the trip
home to Florida five days after completing America's first space
flight since the Challenger tragedy.
   The modified Boeing 747, carrying the shuttle piggyback, took
off from this Mojave Desert military base at 7:54 a.m., said Nancy
Lovato, spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``It was a fitting finish to a super mission,'' Ms. Lovato said.
``It was the prettiest takeoff from here that I've ever seen, and
I've seen them all.''
   The jet was expected to arrive at Kennedy Space Center in
Florida late today after a refueling stop at Kelly Air Force Base
in San Antonio, Texas.
   Discovery and its five-man crew landed on the hard clay Rogers
Dry Lake bed last Monday, four days after launch from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., on the first shuttle flight since Challenger
exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven crew members.
   Since Discovery landed in California, NASA workers have toiled
to prepare it for its ride to Florida. They photographed and
replaced damaged heat-shield tiles, purged fuel from its main
engines and orbital maneuvering engines, installed a tailcone and
locks to prevent control surfaces from fluttering on the ride home,
then hoisted it to its perch atop the jet.

   Republican George Bush today denounced as
``absolutely ludicrous'' any notion that he is trying to keep his
distance from running mate Dan Quayle.
   ``He's doing just fine,'' Bush said in answer to a question from
reporters after he accepted the endorsement of a law enforcement
official. ``I support him very strongly.''
   Bush added with apparent anger in his voice, ``This concept that
I see in some of these reports that I am not supportive of Dan
Quayle are absolutely ludicrous.''
   ``They are ridiculous,'' he said. ``He did well in that debate.
He has my full support ... and I made a good decision'' in
selecting the Indiana senator.
   Bush said he gets ``a little tired of erroneous reporting out
there.''
   He was endorsed today by Dewey Stokes, president of the National
Fraternal Order of Police, who called Bush ``the law enforcement
candidate.''
   However, while a news release from the Bush campaign touted the
197,000-person membership of Stokes' organization, Stokes
acknowledged that he was only giving his personal support, not that
of the organization, which has not taken a position.
   Bush has made Massachusetts' former prison furlough program the
centerpiece of his soft-on-crime attack against presidential rival
Michael Dukakis, but a top aide said Friday that Bush believes the
federal prison furlough program should be reviewed as well.
   Dukakis aides have criticized Bush for attacking Dukakis on the
subject while Bush is vice president of a federal system that also
has a furlough program.
   ``There's no question that the federal furlough program should
be reviewed,'' Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, told reporters
on Friday. ``We talked about it today ... George Bush would have
his attorney general do that.''
   Fuller said the Republican candidate had no specific proposal to
revise the current law, and that Bush was satisfied it is
``fundamentally different'' from the Massachusetts law that granted
a weekend furlough in 1986 to convicted murderer Willie Horton.
   Questions about the federal furlough program arose as Bush
stepped up his attack against Dukakis over the furlough program in
the Democratic governor's home state.
   In a campaign speech Friday in Xenia, Ohio, Bush charged that
Dukakis as governor ``relented'' and repealed the law that let
murderers go on weekend furlough ``under the bright spotlight of
the national presidential campaign'' this year.
   Bush called Dukakis ``the furlough king'' later at an outdoor
rally of several thousand pople in Medina, an affluent white suburb
of Cleveland.
   He continued the tough-on-crime talk at a later rally at Lee's
Summit High School in Missouri before returning to Washington.
   He said Dukakis has always espoused liberal views.
   ``What I fault him for is trying to now be something he is
not,'' Bush told the packed high school gym.
   Reporters were denied access to Bush, as has been the case since
last week, but the campaign put out an information sheet when asked
what Bush had to say on the federal government's own furlough
program.
   It said the federal furloughs are granted only within two years
of a prisoner's release date.
   The Massachusetts program was more lenient, Fuller said, citing
the Horton case in which Horton bludgeoned a Maryland couple,
raping the woman, after escaping during a weekend furlough.
   Fuller said Horton could not have been furloughed under the
federal program, which is available only to prisoners in
``community custody,'' the lowest security level in the federal
prison system.
   In some of the harshest language he has used to describe Dukakis
as soft on crime, Bush alleged Friday that his rival has compassion
for criminals but ``an astounding lack of sensitivity'' for crime
victims.
   ``He still clings to a discredited liberal ideology that blinds
him to the true causes of crime, and the often devastating effects
it has on innocent people,'' Bush said in the Xenia speech to law
enforcement officials and supporters.
   ``I'm not faulting the governor of Maassachusetts for one error
in judgment. But it concerns me deeply that in all this time, as
far as I know, the governor has never acknowledged that his
furlough program was a mistake,'' Bush said.
   ``On no other issue is my opponent's philosophy so completely at
odds with mine, and I would say, with the common sense attitudes of
the American people, than on the issue of crime,'' Bush said.
   Another crime-oriented speech is set for Monday in New Jersey,
campaign aides said.

<HEAD>Hoss Rejects U.N. Role in Presidential Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Lebanon's Syrian-backed
Cabinet on Saturday opposed deploying U.N. peacekeeping troops to
supervise deadlocked presidential elections. The proposal is backed
by a rival Christian Cabinet.
   ``There are practical procedural difficulties at the United
Nations in assigning U.N. forces internal missions like supervision
of security for the presidential election session,'' Acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss told reporters before leaving for talks in
Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   He planned to discuss the presidential election with officials
there.
   ``The reasons behind the failure to elect a president have not
been related to security issues so far, but to the lack of
consensus on the president's identity and his political line,''
Hoss said.
   Lebanon's government splintered into rival Moslem and Christian
factions after Parliament failed to elect a new president when Amin
Gemayel's term expired Sept. 22.
   A French proposal to deploy U.N. forces in Beirut to oversee the
election was endorsed by Lebanon's Christian militia commander,
Samir Geagea, on Thursday.
   Geagea, who opposes Syria's involvement in Lebanon, backs the
Christian Cabinet headed by the army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in eastern and northern provinces as well as in the Moslem western
and southern sectors of Beirut.
   Parliament failed to elect a new president due to a lack of
quorum following a boycott by Christian deputies.
   Gemayel, acting minutes before the expiration of his term,
appointed Gen. Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, to head a six-man interim
Cabinet.
   Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist leaders have rejected Aoun's
cabinet, continuing to recognize Hoss' five-man body that ruled
during Gemayel's term.

<HEAD>How Congress Rewrote Washington's Laws</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When the 100th Congress began, the District of
Columbia dreamed of becoming the nation's 51st state. But as
Congress winds down almost two years later, the dream has ended and
the nation's capital is hoping to hold on to whatever limited
self-governance it has.
   Somehow, the district became entangled in four touchy issues _
abortion rights, life insurance for AIDS victims, homosexual rights
and a residency requirement for city workers.
   In all four, Congress has told the city to change its laws or
lose the money the federal government provides as a payment for the
cost incurred in being the seat of the federal government.
   Those actions stunned city officials, especially Walter
Fauntroy, the local clergyman who serves as the district's
non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives. He accused
colleagues of exerting ``raw, naked power'' over the city.
   ``It is unfair to single out the District of Columbia and tell
them how to spend local funds,'' fumes Fauntroy. ``That violates
the letter and spirit of home rule.''
   Adds Julius Hobson, the city's chief lobbyist to Congress, ``By
taking these actions, the Congress has in effect created the U.S.
Department of the District of Columbia. The floodgates have been
opened. After this, what next?''
   Fauntroy had bragged he would force a vote on the House floor on
the statehood issue by last July 4. He was wrong, and he now
concedes the issue may not even come up for a vote in the 101st
Congress, which begins its two-year run in January.
   Under the limited home rule law enacted by Congress in 1974,
Congress approves the city's budget. Home rule gave the city's
670,000 residents the right to elect a mayor and city council, but
left them without a vote in Congress and provided a congressional
veto of laws enacted by the city council. Congress has exercised
the veto only twice before.
   This year's city budget is $3.2 billion, including $539 million
in federal money, which is supposed to be a payment in lieu of
taxes on real estate owned by the federal government and foreign
governments.
   On the demand of conservatives, Congress attached amendments to
the appropriations bill and President Reagan signed them into law
last weekend.
   One provides that the city couldn't pay for any abortions except
to save the life of the mother. In the past eight years, the
district government paid for 32,725 abortions.
   Another amendent demanded that the city repeal a law requiring
insurance companies to sell life insurance to people with AIDS. A
third insisted the city revamp its human rights code under which
Georgetown University has been required to grant rights to gay
student groups.
   A fourth told the city to soften its law requiring most city
employees to live within the district's boundaries.
   ``The city just happened to be a victim'' on the issues of
abortion and gay rights, said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who
sided with the city on those questions. ``The city became a
battleground for two larger social issues. It just happened to be
there at the wrong time.''
   Meanwhile, the statehood quest, championed by Fauntroy, has
bogged down over questions about whether Congress would still pay
the city in exchange for lost tax revenues.
   Senate Republicans would be sure to oppose statehood out of
recognition that the heavily-Democratic state of New Columbia
almost certainly would be represented by two Democratic senators.
   Congressional approval of statehood would only be the first
step. A constitutional amendment would have to be approved by
three-quarters of the states before it could take effect.
   In the past, Reagan has threatened to veto the district's
spending package if it did not include abortion language similar to
the restriction proposed by Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif.
   However, Reagan was prevented from doing so because the city
budget was often lumped with several other appropriation measures
into a single bill. Vetoing it would have denied federal agencies
of funds.
   Fauntry said adoption this time of a separate bill dealing with
District of Columbia spending left the city vulnerable to pro-life
and anti-gay forces in Congress.
   While Fauntroy has threatened to encourage city officials to
disobey the congressional orders, and City Council chairman David
Clarke has called for citizens of the nation's capital to take to
the streets in protest, Mayor Marion Barry Jr. surprised many
Washingtonians by remaining aloof.
   ``This vote is not a direct attack on home rule,'' Barry said.
``After all, they did approve every penny of our appropriations
bill. The district bill was just used as a vehicle by special
interest groups on election-year issues.''
   Fauntroy said he is considering filing lawsuits and initiating
non-violent protests to challenge the congressional action. Clarke
said his sworn oath to uphold the constitution would prevent him
from restricting abortion funding or changing the Human Rights Code.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The euphoria that greeted the
soldiers' rebellion in Haiti is giving way to skepticism of new
President Prosper Avril and his apparent view that the nation is
not ready for democracy.
   ``We were encouraged by the coup d'etat; we were optimistic
after our conversation with Lt. Gen. Avril and Sgt. (Joseph)
Heubreux; now we are disappointed,'' said opposition leader Louis
Dejoie Jr., who met with the two last week.
   Dejoie and other political and labor leaders give Avril high
marks for his actions in the three weeks since Heubreux and other
enlisted men of the Presidential Guard deposed Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy and placed Avril in the presidency.
   But concern is growing over Avril's close ties to the
dictatorships that preceded him and a reported reluctance to call
elections.
   Dejoie referred to a story in the Paris daily Liberation, which
quoted Avril as saying Haitians are too poor for immediate
democracy.
   Avril has told some visitors elections probably won't be held
for 2 years.
   On Wednesday, a popular priest said Avril could not be trusted
until he eliminates the dreaded Tonton Macoutes, the private army
that operated under dictators Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier.
Members of the Tonton Macoutes have been blamed for the Sept. 11
killing of 13 parishoners and wounding of more than 70 at St. Jean
Bosco Roman Catholic Church.
   ``The people do not trust you; (the people) should consider all
big-shot Duvalierists as big time criminals until they prove the
contrary for the rest of their lives,'' the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide said in remarks directed to Avril in a radio speech.
   The young priest is considered one of Haiti's most popular
figures among the poor.
   Dejoie said Avril must declare his government short-term and
provisional and reinstate the suspended 1987 constitution.
   Dejoie said Avril also must arrest and try the thugs responsible
for the church slayings and for the deaths of 34 voters during the
aborted presidential election in November.
   He called Avril's statement that Haitians are not ready for
democracy an insult to the people and proof that he ``has not yet
divorced himself from Duvalierism.''
   ``We are not impatient. Two and a half years have gone by since
the fall of the Duvalier regime. We are overpatient,'' said Dejoie.
   Haiti was ruled for 29 years by Francois Duvalier and then his
son, Jean-Claude, who fled the country in February 1986 after
widespread unrest. Namphy led a junta until February, when civilian
President Leslie Manigat was sworn in. Namphy ousted Manigat in
June.
   Avril is a close friend of the younger Duvalier and became a
millionaire as Duvalier's financial adviser.
   Rene Theodore, leader of the Haitian Communist Party, said
Avril's future authority is linked to bringing about democracy in
Haiti.
   ``Whatever Avril might personally desire, he participates in and
is controlled by a situation he did not make himself,'' Theodore
said Tuesday, one day after meeting with Avril and Heubreau.
   The soldiers sent Namphy into exile in the Dominican Republic
and forced Franck Romain, ousted mayor of Port-au-Prince and an
alleged leader of the Macoutes, to seek political asylum in the
Dominican Embassy.
   Avril also retired Col. Jean-Claude Paul, former commander of
the 700-man Dessalines Battalion. On Sept. 30, soldiers arrested
about 30 alleged Macoutes linked to the church massacre.
   Paul, who has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on
drug trafficking charges, was considered the commander most likely
to lead any resistance to the rebellion. He is reported under house
arrest.
   Dejoie said he had gone to Washington seeking support for a
provisional government until elections are held.
   The U.S. government has withheld aid to Haiti.
   ``They still see Avril as involved with Duvalierism,'' Dejoie
said. ``Avril's tarnished image improved after the coup d'etat, but
not enough to shine.''

   A U.S. military team flew to Vietnam on
Saturday to discuss further efforts to resolve the fates of
American servicemen missing in the Vietnam War.
   The experts planned to review results of the first
U.S.-Vietnamese joint field investigation, which was completed
Tuesday after the retrieval of plane wreckage and two sets of human
remains.
   Talks were scheduled in the capital, Hanoi, with officials from
Vietnam's Office For Seeking Missing Personnel.
   The team included Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of the U.S.
Joint Casualty Resolution Center and Lt. Col. Johnie Webb,
commander of the Army Central Identification Laboratory. Both units
based in Honolulu are seeking to resolve the fates of America's
wartime missing.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said last week his
government has agreed in principle to many projects over the next
two months to resolve the 70 MIA cases that Washington considers
top priority.
   A total of 2,393 Americans are listed as missing in action in
the Vietnam War, 1,757 of them in Vietnamese territory and the
others in Laos and Cambodia. The war ended when communist North
Vietnam defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam in April 1975.

   The son of Admiral Richard E. Byrd, the polar
explorer, has been found dead of malnutrition and dehydration in a
warehouse three weeks after he disappeared from a Washington-bound
train, officials said.
   Richard E. Byrd Jr., 68, left Boston on Sept. 13 to attend a
ceremony at National Geographic Society headquarters in Washington
honoring his father with a new stamp.
   He never arrived and his whereabouts remained a mystery for
three weeks.
   ``I put him on a train and my wife was supposed to meet him,''
his son, Leverett Byrd of Needham, Mass., told The (Baltimore) Sun
in a story published Saturday. ``What happened in between, I don't
know. It's very strange, this whole thing. We're trying to come to
grips with it.''
   ``He idolized his father. The main focus of his life was to
continue what my grandfather had started, to help people who wanted
information about him,'' said Leverett Byrd, one of Byrd's four
sons.
   Relatives said Byrd dreamed of establishing a museum in Boston
to the admiral, who in 1926 was one of the first men to fly over
the North Pole and who three years later led an expedition to the
South Pole.
   ``He had all my grandfather's papers, all the manuscripts,''
along with Eskimo boots and coats worn by the explorers, Leverett
Byrd said.
   Richard E. Byrd Jr. had joined his father on an expedition to
the South Pole in the 1940s, Leverett Byrd said.
   Byrd said his father had suffered from some memory loss, but
hadn't wandered before.
   Police said Byrd's body was found Monday in a debris-strewn
warehouse, clad in workman's clothes and one shoe, although he had
left Boston in a tan shirt and brown pants. The custodian who found
his body recalled running him off the property a few days earlier
and believed him to be a drifter.
   Police identified Byrd through a Boston Transit Authority
identification card pinned to his undershorts.
   Leverett Byrd said his father, who lived off small trust funds
and stock market investments, had a hard time being the son of a
famous figure.
   ``His whole life was pretty difficult. You can imagine what it
was like to be the son of Admiral Byrd.''

   Hundreds of fans jammed the book department at
Harrods department store in London to snap up more than 1,000
autographed copies of actress Joan Collins' first novel, ``Prime

   The 55-year-old bad girl of ``Dynasty'' remained unruffled while
she sat at a table for an hour Saturday, signing books while
security men linked arms to keep the crowd away. Perhaps Miss
Collins' equally famous sister, Jackie, had provided tips on
avoiding writer's cramp. Jackie Collins is the author of
``Hollywood Wives'' and other steamy best-sellers.
   A Harrods spokeswoman said the sale of 1,000 autographed books
in an hour _ some signed in advance _ was a record for the store,
breaking one set just two weeks ago when actor Kirk Douglas'
autobiography, ``The Ragman's Son,'' sold about 900 copies when he

   Dolly Parton is host of the awards show, to be aired on CBS-TV.
   The CMA nominations cap a hectic year for Mattea, who married

   ``I could talk about this for 10 hours a day. I've got enough to

   Accompanying the pair on an eight-month stint in Tokyo will be
computerized laser lights, a stage one-third the length of a

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis is trying hard to beat the rap that his experience as a
governor has not equipped him to handle national defense and
foreign policy.
   He has talked tough on military spending and driven an M-1 tank;
met with foreign leaders from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze to French President Francois Mitterrand, and he has
extolled the virtues of governors who became president.
   Or three of them, anyway.
   ``Some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest
international leaders, were governors: Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow
Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt,'' Dukakis said in the first
presidential debate.
   He did not mention the last two presidents, both of them former
governers whose foreign policy performances have brought mixed
reviews.
   Ronald Reagan, a two-term California governor, is regularly
lambasted by critics who say he is unfamiliar with the nitty gritty
of national security. He is faulted for such acts as the 1983
invasion of Grenada and the 1986 bombing of Libya and for moving
slowly on arms control. His record as president will be tainted by
the Iran-Contra affair, as well.
   Jimmy Carter, who was governor of Georgia, is blamed by
conservatives for reacting poorly to revolutions in Iran and
Nicaragua and for allowing U.S. influence abroad to deteriorate.
   If elected, Dukakis would be the third man in a row to move from
the state house to the White House without having held a senior
federal job.
   Only one other former governor, Wilson of New Jersey, has become
president in this century without previously holding top elected or
appointed federal office.
   Franklin Roosevelt, lauded by Dukakis, was assistant secretary
of the Navy during World War I before he served as governor of New
York. Theodore Roosevelt held identical posts at the turn of the
century before becoming vice president and then president.
   Dukakis doesn't have those entries on his resume, but like
others before him, he is trying to ``create a lot of ersatz
credentials'' in foreign policy, said Stephen Hess, who was an aide
to former President Nixon.
   ``They go on trade missions. They join the Council on Foreign
Relations or the Trilateral Commission, which is what Carter did,''
said Hess, now a scholar at the liberal Brookings Institution in
Washington.
   Or they ride tanks and meet with foreign leaders.
   Governors who are elected president ``rely on a brain trust. But
so does everybody else, too, as the field becomes more
specialized,'' said Hess. ``Even Richard Nixon, who was truly
engaged in foreign policy and made it his life interest, brought in
specialists,'' notably Henry Kissinger, who served as his national
security adviser.
   Graham T. Allison Jr., a Dukakis foreign policy adviser, says
the Massachusetts governor's ``style as a leader and governor is
quite different from either Reagan or Carter.''
   Dukakis' ideas ``come out of interaction with other folks. There
is a combination of progressive values and pragmatism that is
something special. It is not classic liberalism,'' said Allison.
   Carter's view of the world was shaped by his career as a
submarine officer in the Navy and his devotion to his Baptist faith.
   He appointed a strong-minded national security adviser, Zbigniew
Brzezinski, a Columbia University professor of Soviet affairs, born
in Poland and deeply suspicious of the Kremlin.
   Carter appointed a very different personality as his secretary
of state, Cyrus Vance, a Wall Street lawyer and veteran of senior
government appointments who was deeply committed to diplomacy and
negotiations.
   ``There were two world-views spinning around'' at the top level
of government, said Hess, and the result was a sometimes confused
and vacillating approach to foreign affairs that ultimately brought
Vance's resignation.
   Allison said ``Carter was very interested in detail. He had
difficulty keeping his mind focused on the big picture, and was
unable to resist an overly expansive agenda.''
   ``Reagan is very effective at projecting a few central themes
but does not involve himself directly in the issues, neither in the
broad shape of the issues or in the details. But he has kept in
mind a few simple things and knows what a manageable agenda is,''
said Allison, who is dean of the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, where Dukakis once taught and
where he turns for much of his foreign policy advice.
   Conflicting views of the world at the top of the administration
``were not Reagan's problem,'' Hess said. ``He had a distinct point
of view that the people who were working for him had no trouble
following.''
   Reagan survived several overseas debacles, including the bombing
of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut in 1983, but his hands-off
management style contributed to the worst policy crisis of his
administration, the exchange of arms for hostages with Iran.
   Clearly ``Reagan has had trouble with national security
advisers,'' running through six in seven years, said Hess.
   Dukakis has not said publicly who he might appoint national
security adviser or secretary of state if he is elected. But among
those often mentioned for those two important posts are Allison and
two colleagues from the Kennedy School, Joseph Nye and Albert
Carnesdale, along with Madeleine Albright, a Czechoslovakian-born
Georgetown University professor who served in the Carter White
House.

   President Reagan, contending the American
people have ``had it'' with drug users and pushers, today exhorted
the Senate to approve tough, House-passed anti-drug legislation
before adjourning next week.
   ``Time is fast running out,'' Reagan said in his weekly radio
address, delivered from his weekend retreat at Camp David, Md.
   ``I want all Americans to take heart. This war is not yet won,
not by a long shot, but we are doing better and our nation is
united against this scourge as never before,'' Reagan said.
   The House has passed one version of the legislation, but the
measure has not yet come before the full Senate.
   ``The House bill has many good and tough provisions that express
our national commitment to five simple but powerful words _ those
words are `zero tolerance' and `Just say no,''' Reagan said,
lifting the slogan from his wife Nancy's anti-drug education
campaign.
   ``By zero tolerance, we mean simply, that we've had it,'' Reagan
said. ``We will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those
who buy drugs.
   ``All Americans of good will are determined to stamp out those
parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy
and vitality and humanity of others. They must pay,'' he said.
   Reagan pointed out that the bill passed by the House earlier
this month on a 375-30 vote includes the death penalty for those
who kill a law enforcement officer or authorizes the killing of
anyone in a drug-related crime.
   ``We must, we need and we will have this law,'' he said.
   Reagan also put in a plug for Vice President George Bush,
calling the GOP presidential candidate his ``point man'' on the
administration's anti-drug fight.
   Senators have been negotiating privately over crucial
time-limiting agreements that would enable Congress to pass the
anti-drug measure before adjournment, expected to come at the end
of next week.
   A bipartisan group of sponsors introduced the drug measure in
the Senate on Monday. But they agreed the Senate will run out of
time if long debates ensue over controversial issues such as user
penalties and allowing the admission in federal court of evidence
seized illegally, but in ``good faith.''

   The setting sun was glaring into camera
lenses, it was late in the afternoon, and Michael Dukakis was doing
the main ``visual'' of his campaign day, helping to destroy
confiscated drugs at an incinerator in suburban Detroit. But few
Americans would ever see it.
   The event was too late to make it onto the evening TV news, the
low angle of the sun made photographs difficult if not impossible,
and even those at the site _ squinting to see _ could not make out
exactly what it was that the Democratic presidential nominee was
doing.
   That same day, rival George Bush was on the scene for the
majestic landing of the space shuttle Discovery.
   The two events, and the way that campaign strategists set up
their respective candidate's participation in them, helps dramatize
the differences between the two campaigns _ although, to be sure,
Bush is able to capitalize on events he can attend like the
Discovery landing by virtue of his current office.
   While the vice president's campaign is by most accounts slick
and polished, the Dukakis campaign remains, according to critics,
uneven and sometimes amateurish.
   Some observers suggest that the number of seasoned veterans in
Bush's campaign, beginning at the top with former Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III, a veteran of three past presidential
campaigns, is a prime reason for the skill and quick reaction time
often shown by the GOP campaign.
   Baker's guiding hand on the campaign of his longtime friend is
also widely viewed as a main reason why Bush has emerged since the
GOP convention in August as more aggressive and less frantic than
he appeared before.
   However, observers also suggest that Dukakis' high command is
improving on logistics and strategy, particularly with the
re-appearance of veteran John Sasso on Labor Day as the campaign's
chief strategist.
   Susan Estrich, who worked in the presidential campaigns of
Walter Mondale in 1984 and Edward Kennedy in 1980, remains Dukakis'
campaign manager.
   ``Mike Dukakis is an outsider whose team was largely composed of
veterans of Massachusetts politics. And he's been slower to
integrate the professionals,'' said Norman Ornstein, a political
analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
   Ornstein said that Bush is ``an insider, who pulled in inside
people around him.''
   The Bush campaign over the past few weeks:
   _ Twice raided Dukakis' home state to pick up the endorsements
of police organizations, part of Bush's effort to portray his rival
as soft on crime.
   _ Moved quickly, after the first nationally televised
presidential debate, to say that Bush did not want to make women
who seek abortions guilty of criminal activity, even after he had
left the issue vague.
   _ Has made the most of staged visual events to get on the
evening news, sticking to one message each day and reinforcing it
with photogenic campaign events.
   Bush doesn't just show up at campaign events. He makes
entrances. Bands play, thousands of balloons go up. At a rally in
Owensboro, Ky., last week, Bush arrived on a brightly decorated
riverboat. And traveling across Illinois by bus, he brought his own
warm-up group with him: country singers Crystal Gayle and Loretta
Lynn.
   Bush's campaign team is several layers deep.
   His main campaign staff includes such professionals as campaign
manager Lee Atwater, an official in President Reagan's 1980 and
1984 campaigns; pollster Robert S. Teeter, who has worked on every
presidential race for the past two decades, and Roger Ailes, who
was chief media consultant for Richard Nixon in 1972 and for a host
of GOP candidates since.
   The first team is augmented by GOP consultants who don't draw a
regular salary but whose expertise is routinely called on _ and who
have narrow, specific assignments.
   For instance, Charles Black, who has worked two past
presidential campaigns, is currently focusing just on Texas.
   Eddie Mahe Jr., a longtime GOP consultant, has one job with the
campaign: studying Dukakis' daily campaign techniques and reporting
back on which ones seem to be working.
   Richard Bond, Bush's national political director, was assigned
to keep an eye on New Jersey, then over the past few days was
reassigned to travel with GOP vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle to oversee a program of damage control after the vice
presidential debate.
   He joins another political veteran, Stuart Spencer, who was
assigned full-time to Quayle at the GOP convention.
   Bush himself seldom gets involved with day-to-day strategy.
Dukakis does.
   Asked whether he had seen his recent campaign ads attacking
Quayle, Dukakis said: ``Are you kidding? Nothing goes on around
here without me knowing.''
   Meanwhile, Dukakis' circle of top-level advisers has been
changing _ in part in reaction to Democratic critics who said the
campaign had not brought in experienced party leaders.
   For instance, Dukakis on recent campaign trips has been
accompanied by Theodore C. Sorenson, a former speechwriter to John
Kennedy.
   Also, traveling with Dukakis in recent days have been Washington
lawyers and longtime Democratic political consultants Stephen
Engelberg and Peter Edelman. And Robert Schrum, veteran of Sen.
Edward Kennedy's presidential bid, has been brought in to bolster
the speechwriting staff.
   Campaign chairman Paul Brountas travels nearly everywhere with
Dukakis. He is a respected Boston corporate lawyer and a long-time
friend of Dukakis. His last national campaign experience was with
Edmund Muskie.
   Francis O'Brien, a veteran campaign aide and occasional movie
producer, has taken on a more visible role since the return of
Sasso. O'Brien now travels with Dukakis and is trying to coordinate
the political message with what appears on television.
   Kirk O'Donnell, a former aide to then-House Speaker Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neill, was brought in last spring and given a large role
in shaping the political message.
   The campaign has also brought in a few aides from other
Democratic campaigns. Larry Harrington, political director for the
Albert Gore campaign, is Dukakis' Southern coordinator. Richard
Moe, a Washington lawyer who was with Gephardt, is an occasional
adviser. Donna Brazille, from the Jesse Jackson campaign, sometimes
travels with Dukakis.
   Thomas Donilon, a top official with Walter Mondale's 1984
campaign, helped coordinate debate preparation.
   Still, few of these individuals have extensive experience in
presidential campaigns.
   ``I think the Democrats have been behind on that for some time,
even though they're beginning to catch up,'' said Bob Beckel,
former campaign manager for Mondale.
   ``Bush and his people used the period from the spring to the
convention very well to bring in the best talent in their party.
And they made a much faster transition from the primary to the
general election than did the Dukakis campaign,'' Beckel said.

<HEAD>Yale Acquires Docuemnts Of Powerful Italian Family</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A huge archive of long-secret documents
of a family powerful in Italy during the Renaissance has been
acquired by Yale University and may give scholars a better
understanding of 15th- and 16th-century Europe.
   The Spinelli family were bankers and businessmen who held
important offices in the Florentine state. Family members also were
generals in wars between Italian city-states, treasurers to popes,
spies and ambassadors. The family's activities spanned four
centuries.
   The family even had business offices in Rome, Venice, Barcelona,
Lyons and London.
   Yale announced Saturday that it obtained the collection in April
through a Swiss rare books dealer. Yale spokesman Walter Littell
said he didn't know how much Yale paid for it and said no further
information would be made available about the deal.
   The collection obtained by Yale's Beinecke Rare Book and
Manuscript Library comprises more than 150,000 detailed records and
chronicles that have never been studied by scholars and are
virtually unknown to historians, Yale said.
   The documents are ``among the most significant of any known
Italian archive,'' said Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr.
   Ralph W. Franklin, Beinecke director, said the collection
includes records of banking activities, international trade and
finance, family life, marriage, slavery, inheritance, private
wealth and patronage of charitable organizations.
   The records also include detailed information about the business
concerns of other families, including the Medicis and Borgias.
   ``I do not think history books on the period will be written
again without mentioning the Spinelli. The Spinelli's relationships
with the Medici are well documented and the families even
intermarried, but the Spinelli represent a completely different
faction of Florentine politics,'' said Robert G. Babcock, the
library's Edwin J. Beinecke Curator of Early Books and Manuscipts.
   Yale officials said the most significant document found in the
collection is a 1440 record by Tommaso Spinelli, treasurer for
several popes in the 15th century. It is his record of tax payments
to the Vatican by every diocese and abbey in the world, and
codifies the financial state of the church under Eugenius IV, who
was pope from 1431-1447.
   Yale said it could take as long as four years to complete
cataloging the documents. Some of them might be made available to
scholars as early as January, and an exhibition of some of the
documents will open at the university in May.

   Amid tears and grief, thousands of people who
have died of AIDS were memorialized Saturday in ceremonies centered
on a huge quilt made by friends and family members of the victims.
   ``One of the most important things we get here today is the
strength and sense of community we can feel, and the knowledge that
this terrible disease affects everyone,'' said Cleve Jones,
director of the Names Project.
   Jones, 34, is the founder of the San Francisco-based
commemorative project, which involved making a huge fabric quilt
that was spread out on the Ellipse, south of the White House.
   The quilt, five times larger than when it was displayed here
last year, contains 8,288 handmade panels, each in memory of a
single person or group of people who have died of AIDS since 1981.
   Each of the panels measures three feet by six feet and all 50
states and a dozen foreign countries are represented. The panels
are made from a variety of fabrics and many are elaborately
decorated. The 375,000-square-foot quilt is bisected by walkways.
   While hundreds of people walked among the panels on the sunny,
chilly morning, volunteers read the names of thousands of AIDS
victims.
   One of the 495 volunteer readers was scheduled to be Kitty
Dukakis, wife of the Democratic presidential candidate. But her
appearance was canceled because her flight to Washington later
Saturday was delayed.
   Jones began the Names Project in 1986 after a friend died of
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Since then, it has blossomed into a nationwide project and the
quilt has been on a 20-city tour in the past 18 months. The quilt
includes the names of about one-fifth of the approximately 42,000
Americans known to have died of AIDS since 1981.
   ``It's a very beautiful thing, but it's built on corpses,''
Jones said. ``We've learned from the quilt that country is filled
with good, kind, decent people who understand how to respond, who
understand that this is affecting all people, regardless of their
race, background of sexuality.''
   Jones said panels are still being accepted, although he said
organizers haven't decided how many more panels to add to the
quilt. More than 10,000 have been made, and panels not added to the
quilt were on display around the city in smaller quilts.
   One of the visitors was Lillian Mello, of San Jose, Calif. Her
23-year-old son, Patrick, died last Christmas Eve.
   With tears in her eyes, she wrote on a blank panel of the quilt:
``I pray that mothers and fathers will love and stand by their sons
and daughters even when they don't understand or accept their
lifestyle.'' She signed it: ``A mother who's glad she did.''
   Two of the readers were Mayer and Pat Levy of St. Louis, whose
31-year-old son died last year.
   ``We're doing this in memory of our son _ to help others,'' Levy
said tearfully, noting the quilt would help parents ``relieve their
grief and acknowledge that their son was gay and passed away.''
   Others, like Chris Bates of Washington, D.C. simply wept.
   ``I knew all of these people in New York, San Francisco and
Washington,'' Bates said between sobs. ``They were my
contemporaries. I'm not 40 yet and all I talk about now is death _
my grandmother talks about death _ it's not right.''

<HEAD>Politburo Discusses Budget Cut, Making Ruble Convertible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Politburo is considering cutting the
national budget and discussed making the ruble a convertible
currency, the Communist Party daily Pravda said Saturday.
   The newspaper said the subjects were discussed Thursday during a
session on the 1989 budget.
   Pravda said the 12-man Politburo discussed ``steps to make the
ruble a convertible currency.'' It did not explain further.
   Some Soviet economists have argued for making the ruble
convertible, so it could be transferred into other currencies on
the world market.
   This would remove a major stumbling block to trade, but it would
likely cause runaway inflation because the ruble's value would drop.
   The newspaper also did not give any details on the plans to cut
the budget, which is reportedly running at a deficit of more than
$100 billion. It said only that there were plans to ``reduce
expenses in all areas of the economy.''
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya reported last month that the
country is running a budget deficit of at least 73 billion rubles,
or $116 billion. The U.S. budget deficit is $150 billion.
   The Soviet deficit amounts to about 15 percent of the budget,
which is about $773 billion, Sovietskaya Rossiya said.
   It blamed the deficit on the cost of cleaning up the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant disaster, lower income to the state from
slashed vodka sales, and the falling price of oil. The Soviet Union
is the world's biggest oil exporter.
   Pravda said that while the Politburo wants to reduce expenses,
it also decided to improve the supply of food and consumer goods.
There were no details.
   Consumers surrounded Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
visit last month to Siberia and complained that his plans for
perestroika, or restructuring of the economy and society, have not
solved chronic shortages of food and housing.
   The Politburo reviews the budget, which is then rubber stamped
by the Supreme Soviet, or legislature. The Supreme Soviet is
scheduled to take up the budget in a session later this month.

   Two Coast Guardsmen braved six-foot
waves and near-gale-force wind to swim out to rescue six people
whose sailboat had been driven onto rocks during stormy weather,
the Coast Guard said Saturday.
   ``That boat was really taking a pounding in the surf,'' said
Petty Officer 3rd Class William J. Murray. ``We knew we had to take
the people off right then, and the only way to get to them was to
send rescue swimmers to them through the surf.''
   The 38-foot sloop Triple Creme, headed from New York to Newport,
was driven onto the rocks at Point Judith Light late Friday by a
stiff east wind.
   A Coast Guard petty officer who happened to look out the window
of the Point Judith station saw the boat on the rocks, amid waves
that were topping six feet, Murray said.
   Petty Officer 3rd Class John C. Hunter of Norton, Mass., and
Seaman Todd Dillinger of Fowlerville, Mich., donned rubber suits,
lifejackets and swimmers' harnesses, and breasted the waves and
35-mph wind, he said.
   One at a time, they ferried three of the people back to shore,
Murray said.
   Hunter and Dillinger then swam out to the boat again, rigged its
life raft and guided the raft and the other three occupants to
safety, he said.
   ``It looked pretty hairy, but everybody made it okay,'' Murray
said.
   ``Everybody was fine _ a little wet and scared,'' Murray said.
   He identified the rescued people as Steve Kaufman, 24, and
Michael Kim, 25, of New York City; Patricia Mi, 25, and Laura
Makatani, 23, of Washington; Joseph T. Seko, 28, of Middletown,
N.J.; and Vida Wu, 28, of Greenwich, Conn.

<HEAD>There's No Shuttle Museum Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years ago, with appropriate hoopla, the
space shuttle Enterprise was carried piggy-back on an airliner to
Dulles International Airport to await the building of a museum that
would become its permanent home.
   There is no museum yet and, according to Rep. Bill Nelson,
D-Fla., there won't be one for at least five years.
   ``I would like to propose a solution to this problem,'' he wrote
Martin Harwitt, director of the National Air and Space Museum, last
week. ``It seems to me that there is an ideal alternative to
keeping the Enterprise in storage for the next five years; an
alternative that would make it available to many millions of people
at this importrant time in the history of our civil space program.''
   Nelson's solution: Take the Enterprise back to whence it came _
the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which happens to be in
Nelson's congressional district.
   The Enterprise never flew in space and never shuttled. It was a
lame duck from the day it was manufactured. It was used in ``drop
tests'' to see how an orbiter would land unpowered, and in ``fit
tests'' to see how well it fit on its launch pad.
   It was flown around the world on the back of NASA's Boeing 747,
and around this country where huge crowds gazed skyward at the
unusual sight.
   Before being flown to Dulles, just outside of Washington, the
Enterprise had been an exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center. The
cost of packing and unpacking the shuttle for that trip was $1.2
million.
   ``Each year more than 2.5 million tourists visit the Kennedy
Space Center,'' Nelson wrote. ``Over a 5-year period, more than 12
million people would have an opportunity to view this important
symbol of American prowess in space. This would seem to be of much
greater value than simply keeping the Enterprise in storage.''
   The shuttle is too big to be housed in the Smithsonian's Air and
Space Museum and the special building was to have been constructed
at Dulles.
   There was no immediate reaction from the Smithsonian.

   The biggest show of Michelangelo drawings ever
exhibited in this country will give Americans a unique chance to
judge a major argument among art-lovers: did he design a round dome
for St. Peter's in Rome, or the taller dome St. Peter's now has,
like the U.S. Capitol?
   Originally the Capitol, built and rebuilt three centuries after
St. Peter's, had a round dome.
   The exhibit called ``Michelangelo: Draftsman@Architect'' opens
Sunday at the National Gallery of Art.
   One of the people who put it all together was Henry A. Millon,
dean of the museum's Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts.
He wrote in the catalogue that never, before this exhibition, has
so much of the evidence on St. Peter's dome been brought together.
   ``If you are an Anglo-American scholar or a German scholar, you
believe that Michelangelo in the period 1558-61 built the model
that he intended (for) St. Peter's..., a model with a hemispherical
inner and outer dome,'' he told a news conference.
   ``If you are (an) Italian or French (scholar) you believe that
after the model was finished in 1561 he changed his mind and
decided to elevate the outer dome, to the profile that it has
today.''
   The wooden model itself, 16.5 feet high and made under
Michelangelo's direction, is part of the exhibit. It has the same
elongated dome seen on the cathedral today.
   But some scholars believe the shape of both the model, and the
actual dome, was changed on the orders of Giacomo Della Porta, who
finished the dome after Michelangelo's death.
   Also on show is a pen-and-ink drawing attributed to a Frenchman,
Etienne Duperac, from the period between Michelangelo's death and
the completion of the dome. It says:
   ``This building, following the design of (Michelangelo)
Buonarotti, will be finished in this manner...''
   It depicts a round dome, not an elongated one.
   Another feature of the show is a newly-identified Michelangelo
drawing of the suicide of Cleopatra, never shown publicly before.
   Among the unusual pieces is a drawing in black chalk of the
torture of Tityus, a figure in Greek mythology who was punished by
having an enormous bird tear at his vitals. Michelangelo held the
drawing up to the light, traced it on the other side of the paper,
elimninated the bird, added a Roman soldier and presented the
result as a resurrected Christ.
   The show will be open in the gallery's West Building until Dec.
11. After that, the part of the show that consists mainly of figure
drawings will go to the Louvre in Paris.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Police Leader's Endorsement, Defends Quayle</HEAD>

   George Bush, dogged by questions about his
embattled running mate, fought to keep the spotlight on his
tough-on-crime message Saturday by collecting another
law-enforcement endorsement.
   After the event, he said it was ``absolutely ludicrous'' to
suggest his support of Sen. Dan Quayle has lagged since Wednesday
night's vice presidential debate.
   Bush's latest in a series of endorsement announcements came from
Dewey Stokes, president of the national Fraternal Order of Police,
who called Bush ``the law enforcement candidate.''
   While a fact sheet released by the campaign highlighted Stokes'
role as head of the 197,000-member organization, stating it is the
largest law-enforcement group in the country, Stokes acknowledged
that his endorsement was a personal one, not representing the
organization. He said the group as a body would not make an
endorsement before the election.
   At the brief announcement outside Bush's Washington home, Bush
and Stokes acknowledged in response to reporters' questions that
they differ on at least one law-enforcement issue: a waiting period
to purchase a gun.
   Stokes' group favors a federal law requiring a seven-day waiting
period so that a purchaser's record can be checked before he can
buy a gun. Stokes said the waiting period is ``a common sense
approach.''
   Bush said, ``I don't favor a federal waiting period. I do favor
the states having the right to do that.'' Noting that he differs
with Stokes, he said, ``We don't agree on every single issue but
that is my position.''
   The vice president, at first bypassing further questions as he
has for the past 10 days, turned to go back into his house. But
when someone shouted a question about how Quayle was doing, Bush
turned and said heatedly:
   ``He's doing just fine. Just fine and I support him strongly.
Let me say something about that. This concept that I see in some of
these reports that I am not supportive of Dan Quayle are absolutely
ludicrous. They are ridiculous.''
   Although Bush's references to Quayle have diminished since his
running mate's debate Wednesday night with Democratic vice
presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, Bush said it was ``erroneous
reporting'' to suggest there is any meaning to that.
   ``He did well in that debate. He has my full support and he is
getting strong support since the debate. ... I made a good decision
and the American people saw it in that debate.''
   Bush's opponent, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, has
intensified his criticism of Quayle since the debate, frequently
belittling him in campaign speeches. The Dukakis campaign also has
a new TV ad focusing on Quayle.
   Bush continues to hammer Dukakis as soft on crime, with another
anti-crime speech slated for Monday in New Jersey.
   On Sunday Bush was to campaign in Chicago.

   September to 5.4 percent for all civilian workers and 5.3 percent
when you include the military. But behind these numbers is more
good news _ 255,000 got new jobs last month in the non-farm sector,
which means that since the recovery began in 1982, over 18 million
new jobs have been created. There's nothing more pleasing than
watching America move forward with purpose and the news reminds us
yet again that this great nation is, as Senator Dan Quayle said,
the envy of the world.
   Now, I'd like to turn to another subject, the war on drugs. I
want all Americans to take heart. This war is not yet won, not by a
long shot, but we're doing better and our nation is united against
this scourge as never before. Right now there is a drug bill on
Capitol Hill. It has passed the House but hasn't even come up for
consideration in the Senate and time is fast running out.
   The House bill has many good and tough provisions that express
our national commitment to five simple, but powerful, words. Those
words are ``zero tolerance'' and ``Just say no.'' When we say zero
tolerance, we mean simply that we've had it. We will no longer
tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs. All
Americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites
who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality
and humanity of others. They must pay.
   We believe that when those who sell drugs are caught, they must
make redress for the damage they cause. That's why the
administration, personified by the leadership and passion of this
administration's point man on drugs, Vice President George Bush,
and the national voice of conscience, my wife Nancy, has advocated
tougher measures than ever before to combat the drug runners and
the drug dealers.
   We are doing this by seizing the ill-gotten possessions of drug
dealers and their accomplices. Those fancy cars and fancy houses
and bank accounts full of dirty money aren't really theirs. They
were bought from the sale of illegal blood pollutants. We do not
tolerate companies that poison our harbors and rivers, and we won't
let people who are poisoning the blood of our children get away
with it either.
   Those who have the gall to use federally subsidized housing to
peddle their toxins must get the message as well. We will not
tolerate those who think they can do their dirty work in the same
quarters where disadvantaged Americans struggle to build a better
life. We want to kick the vermin out and keep them out.
   Nor can we allow these people to hide behind bizarre legal
challenges when we do arrest them, and we must work to see them
jailed. And that's why we're advocating a change in the law that
will allow exceptions in the so-called ``exclusionary rule'' to
permit the use in court of evidence gathered in good faith by the
police. Nor can our vigilance cease once they're behind bars.
   George Bush has proposed, and I support, drug testing for all
who seek early release from jail, to send them this message, ``You
don't go free until you're drug free.'' We won't have a drug-free
society until we manage to stop the drugs before they get to our
shores. We must protect our coasts, and that means using the
resources and calling on the noble men and women of the Coast Guard
to protect us.
   We've sought increases in the drug enforcement budget, but in
the past we've encountered consistent resistance from Congress. I
requested $538 million for the Drug Enforcement Adminstration in
fiscal 1989, but Congress hacked $33 million away.
   I think drug enforcement is too important a matter for this kind
of political behavior, and I imagine you agree with me. But there
is a way more vital than all of these, that we can express our
revulsion at violence and degradation of the life of the drug
peddler. These people seem to feel nothing, no fear, no remorse,
nothing, when they pull out a machine gun and murder a police
officer in the line of duty.
   The bill that has passed the House provides for the death
penalty for these vicious killers. We must, we need, and we will
have this law. Now, there are those who've opposed the House bill
because it includes the death penalty. Others oppose it because of
the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.
   I believe these people are more concerned with the abstract
rights of criminals than the right of our society to save itself
from those, in this country and outside, who seek their fortune in
our national misfortune.
   I challenge the U.S. Senate to get that bill passed. The nation
demands it and there's no time to waste. Compromises on the key
provisions are unacceptable. We must let the drug kingpins know
your days are numbered. Our cause is just, and we will triumph.
   Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you.

<HEAD>`Red Tide' Brings Shellfish Ban To Puget Sound</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs the first graf and 9th grafs, beginning ``South Puget,''

<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Part of Puget Sound has been closed to
shellfishing because of shellfish poisoning, or ``red tide'', and
shellfish from the area are being pulled from store shelves in
eight states, officials said.
   While northern beaches along Puget Sound are routinely closed
due to red tide, this is the first time southern beaches have been
closed because of contaminated shellfish, said Gary Plews,
shellfish supervisor for the state Department of Social and Health
Services.
   ``This is the first time (paralytic shellfish poisoning) has
been found south of the Tacoma (Narrows) Bridge at such high
levels,'' he said.
   Officials said testing was intensified after a 57-year-old Port
Orchard woman was treated for the illness after eating contaminated
oysters from the area a week ago.
   Shellfish poisoning is caused by an invisible, odorless and
tasteless organism that grows naturally in shellfish tissue and
multiplies rapidly in warmer water. It does not threaten dother sea
life, but it can sicken and even kill people who eat elevated
levels of the toxin.
   It is called red tide because of the reddish discoloration of
sea water caused by the organism.
   State and federal agencies said the ban on shellfishing applies
to sport and commercial fishermen and includes all clams, oysters,
mussels and scallops.
   State officials said in a news release that all commercial
shellfish taken from the affected area since Oct. 1 were being
removed from wholesale and retail sale, and will be tested for the
toxin.
   South Puget Sound commercial shellfish go to wholesalers and
retailers in Washington, California, Oregon, Alaska, Hawaii,
Pennsylvania, Maine and New York.
   South Puget Sound produces two-thirds of the Puget Sound
harvest, and Washington state is the nation's largest oyster
producer.
   Symptoms of shellfish poisoning include vomiting, nausea, muscle
weakness, and tingling of lips, mouth and teeth, the news release
said. Loss of balance and lack of muscular coordination can follow.
Those struck generally do not die, but elderly people and those
with other medical conditions can be affected more severely.

<HEAD>Iran Says Iraq Agrees On Need Break Peace Talks Impasse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq
have agreed in principle to a U.N. proposal to end their 8-year-old
war, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said Saturday.
   Iraqi officials indicated that the 6-week-old peace talks remain
deadlocked.
   Velayati, interviewed by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency as he flew back to Tehran from New York, said negotiators
from both sides agreed that Iran and Iraq would withdraw their
troops within 15 days to pre-war borders and exchange war prisoners.
   Several hours after IRNA reported Velayati's comments, Iraq's
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Saddoum Hamadi, declared
that ``Iraq will not relinquish even one inch of its territory'' to
Iran.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Hamadi as telling a
meeting of Iraq's ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party that ``Iraq
imposed its will of peace on Iran from a position of strength.''
   Both reports were monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Hamadi made no direct reference to Velayati's comments. But a
senior Iraqi official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press the peace talks remain blocked.
   He said the obstacle was Iran's refusal to agree to Iraq's
demand that the disputed Shatt Al-Arab waterway, which forms the
southern boundary between the gulf foes, be cleared for navigation
before further negotiations can be held.
   Both sides have repeatedly accused each other of stalling in the
U.N._mediated negotiations that began Aug.25 in Geneva and moved to
New York. The talks began after both sides accepted a U.N. Security
Council resolution calling for a cease-fire.
   Iraqi officials have accused the United States and its European
allies of softening their hostility toward Iran since the Aug.20
cease-fire began because they want a stake in lucrative contracts
in Iran's massive postwar reconstruction.
   Velayati said that Iran has agreed to drop its ``right to search
ships in the Strait of Hormuz,'' the only gateway to the strategic
Persian Gulf.
   Iran had claimed that until a formal peace treaty was signed, it
was in a state of war with Iraq and had the right to search vessels
sailing into the gulf to determine whether they carried war-related
materials for Iraq.
   Iraq has disputed this. But apart from one Iraqi vessel that was
harrassed immediately after the cease-fire, there have been no
reports of any other Iraqi vessels, or ships heading for Iraqi
ports, being stopped by the Iranians.
   Velayati said the talks in New York, under the supervision of
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and his special
representative, Jan Eliasson, were ``more successful'' than two
previous rounds in Geneva.
   He did not say when the reported agreement would take effect.
   But IRNA quoted him as questioning whether the Iraqi delegation
had the authority to seal any pact.
   He complained that the Iraqis, led by Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz, ``did not have sufficient authority to make decisions.
   ``In order to be successful, the parties involved must have the
authority and the decision-making power. Otherwise, talks will not
progress and will become more complicated,'' Velayati said.
   ``The Iraqi delegates feel somewhat confused as to what they
should do,'' he added.

<HEAD>Wright Says Secrecy Should Never Be Used to Hide Flawed Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright's claim that he
performed a public service by criticizing a covert CIA operation in
Nicaragua has renewed debate over whether secrecy is sometimes used
to hide policies of dubious merit.
   Wright touched off a hot debate three weeks ago when he accused
the spy agency of stirring up civil unrest in Nicaragua to provoke
a crackdown by the leftist Sandinista government. As authority for
his statement, he cited ``clear CIA testimony'' before Congress.
   The House ethics committee now is investigating whether the
Texas Democrat indirectly received classified material given by the
CIA to the Intelligence Committee, then violated the chamber's
rules against public disclosure of classified information. Wright
has contended he did not.
   ``Of course we have to protect genuine government secrets,''
Wright, who as speaker has access to the nation's most sensitive
secrets, said last week. ``But a democracy must never allow secrecy
to be used as a cloak to hide bad policy from the public.''
   But those who deal routinely with top-secret information, the
members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, say the
notion that one lawmaker can decide to speak out about a covert
operation is dangerous.
   ``If you allowed every individual member to make his own
judgments about revealing classified information, it would be the
end of our system,'' said Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of
the Senate Intelligence Committee. Boren said he was not commenting
directly on the Wright case, but was speaking of broad principles.
   ``All discipline would break down, because there's virtually no
policy around here that's unanimous. Even in a democracy, there are
things that have to be kept secret,'' Boren said. Congress risks
being shut out of participation in foreign policy formulation if it
can't keep secrets, he said.
   Highly advanced U.S. technologies that cost millions of dollars
to develop are an example of secrets that must be kept,
intelligence officials say. Delicate U.S. relationships with the
intelligence services of other nations also depend on secrecy. And
lives can be at stake if secrecy of covert operations is breached,
they note.
   In the case of Wright's disclosure, House conservatives have
argued that the speaker placed members of the Nicaraguan political
opposition in jeopardy by linking them to the CIA, and handed the
Sandinistas a propaganda bonanza.
   Covert operations are actions designed to influence events in
other countries while hiding the involvement of the United States.
They range from small-scale actions, involving no more than a
handful of people, to major paramilitary efforts like U.S. support
of the Contras or of the anti-Soviet Afghan rebels.
   Most members of Congress agree that such actions sometimes are
necessary, particularly where normal diplomatic solutions are
impossible. But Boren cautioned that they must be chosen carefully.
The United States should not covertly do things that conflict with
publicly stated policies or generally held U.S. values, he said.
   It was CIA abuses in the 1960s and 70s _ planning for
assassinations of foreign leaders and domestic spying _ that led to
creation of House and Senate intelligence committees a dozen years
ago to pass judgment on the spy agency's most sensitive activities.
   In defending his comments, Wright said he was simply
highlighting that sort of duplicity in the administration's
behavior: giving lip service to peace talks between the government
and the Contras while at the same time making a secret attempt to
undermine those talks by provoking civil unrest.
   Wright's criticism also could be taken as an indirect complaint
about his own intelligence oversight panel, which under the law
would have to have been notified by the CIA about the covert action.
   Intelligence committee members have a variety of remedies if
they disagree with a proposed covert operation.
   Since they authorize all CIA spending one year at a time, they
can threaten to cut off money for the activity, or include legal
language barring it. The CIA's contingency fund, once as large as
$50 million, was cut to roughly half that amount in recent years
because of a desire for more congressional control.
   Committee members also debate covert action proposals and often
can head them off if there is widespread bipartisan opposition. The
CIA prefers to have congressional support so that it won't be left
out in the cold should a covert action become public.
   In Wright's case, he said he had known about the activity since
August 1987 and had repeatedly argued against it privately without
effect.
   Congress' least used, most potent and perhaps ultimate weapon
against a covert action is a threat to go public.
   ``That's the only real hammer,'' said Rep. George Brown,
D-Calif., who left the Intelligence Committee last year in a
dispute with the Pentagon over its classification practices.
   ``There's nothing morally wrong in supporting forces in any part
of the world that reflect the goals of a democratic country,'' said
Brown. ``But you move from that principle down a slippery slope
rapidly. You start creating forces to reflect your democratic
values. ... You let it get out of control, you start paying people
who don't give a damn about your morals.''
   Wright, he said, was speaking on behalf of a majority in
Congress who would have preferred to see U.S. interests in
Nicaragua served through a negotiated peace, and not through what
they see as provocation.
   But Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said Wright was wrong to go
public, even if it was in an off-the-cuff remark. Cohen was
particularly stung by the Wright incident because it doomed chances
for his bill to tighten congressional oversight of covert
operations.
   ``There is nothing to prevent him from going down and talking to
the president one-on-one, calling the head of the CIA, the
secretary of state,'' Cohen said. ``There are a number of ways to
do it. Jim Wright is not the president of the United States, and
the president bears responsibility for the decisions.''

   The radiation-contaminated town of Chernobyl, near
the site of the world's worst nuclear accident, is being razed
because it won't be fit for human habitation for decades, Pravda
said Saturday.
   Officials even plan to erase the Chernobyl adminstrative region
by eliminating Communist Party and government bodies in the area
and transferring seven villages to a neighboring region, the
newspaper reported.
   ``That will be the end to the Chernobyl problem,'' Pravda noted
in an article that objected to the plans.
   Pravda complained that local authorities are taking drastic
action without trying hard enough to clean up the 800-year-old
town. It questioned why the decision was made without prior
announcement and without consulting the people who wanted to go
back to the area to live.
   Pravda said the town's fate was decided by the local Atomic
Energy Ministry Combine, and the newspaper suggested the Academy of
Sciences or higher government organs should have been involved in
the decision.
   Chernobyl, once home to 10,000 people, was evacuated in April
1986 after a fire at the power plant with the same name spewed
radiation worldwide. Officials said 31 people were killed.
   ``The radiation situation in Chernobyl is such that full life of
people cannot resume for decades,'' V. Komarov, chief engineer of
the nuclear power agency now running the power plant, was quoted as
saying.
   Local authorities in the town, which is 11 miles from the plant,
burned one house and then bulldozed two streets of homes in the
central district, the Communist Party newspaper said. Some of the
buildings were just three years old.
   At first, authorities planned to tear down only dilapidated
houses, Komarov wrote in a power plant newspaper quoted by Pravda.
   But ``by the time normal life can return, all the houses will be
equally dilapidated and living in them will be impossible,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``There will be scarcely anything to preserve at
all!''
   Pravda noted that the town of Gden is about the same distance
from the power plant as Chernobyl and has been decontaminated and
repopulated.
   In the revitalized Byelorussian town, new water lines were set
down, streets repaved, roofs were replaced, and all 245 families
returned six months after the accident, Pravda said.
   ``There is not a single such example in the Ukrainian part of
the danger zone,'' even though the wind brought more radioactivity
to Byelorussia than to the Ukraine after the accident, the
newspaper said.
   Pravda also reported that 994 people, mostly middle-aged and
elderly, have defied bans and moved back into the Ukrainian section
of the danger zone, an 18-mile radius from the accident site.
   Reports this spring said 100 people had returned to Chernobyl
itself, but Pravda said they were given no consideration in the
decision to raze the town.
   Gamma background radiation levels in Chernobyl were 0.1
milliroentgen per hour as of June, equal to the natural
radioactivity in mountainous areas and twice that of the Ukrainian
capital of Kiev to the south, the newspaper said.
   Kiev regional officials said last year that at least 27 towns
and villages were too contaminated to be populated in the
foreseeable future. A new town for workers at the power plant was
built 35 miles from Chernobyl.

<TEXT>
   Violent riots sweeping this North
African Arab nation grew out of years of frustration with the rigid
socialist system and a declining economy that has created a growing
crowd of jobless youth.
   The precise motives and causes of different groups of rioters in
the past several days have been difficult to disentangle.
   A shadowy Islamic fundamentalist movement on Saturday said it
started the unrest and warned it would unleash even greater
violence unless its demands are met.
   The previously unknown ``Movement for Algerian Renewal''
presented a series of demands, including satisfying the immediate
needs of the population and replacing the government of President
Chadli Bendjedid.
   Since a 1965 military coup, Algeria has been under a stern,
Soviet-style government. The constitution declares Islam the state
religion but says socialism is the only path to independence.
   The revolt began Tuesday with spontaneous acts of violence by
youngsters without any distinct political or social cause. Their
slogans attacked the high cost of living and the ``fat cats''
living in luxury, but they offered no remedies. Some chants
supported competing Algerian soccer teams.
   Moslem fundamentalists, recognizable in the fast-living capital
by their beards and flowing white robes, began taking over the
movement Thursday. Small groups of them were seen taking the lead
of violent crowds and pointing out the luxury stores and
restaurants for the wealthy as suitable targets for the masses'
wrath.
   But later, the Moslems were seen reasoning with the crowd and
encouraging them to disperse peacefully.
   With the army's tanks and armored personnel carriers deployed at
strategic points throughout the capital and troops with fixed
bayonets ready to shoot to maintain public order, the older and
more experienced fundamentalists had no difficulty getting their
point across.
   On Saturday, they flung off the veil and proclaimed themselves
the ``leaders of the movement of revolt'' in a statement
distributed to news organizations.
   But it was not known whether the Islamic fundamentalists
actually set the protests in motion or were rushing to the front to
try to lead the parade in the direction they preferred.
   So far, the fundamentalist movement is alone in its attempt to
make political capital out of the revolt.
   No one has demanded a limitation of the soaring birthrate or
measures to cope with unemployment, which has reached 40 percent in
the larger cities. The fundamentalists have been reluctant to
address these deeper causes of popular discontent.
   Their demand for the removal of the government did not include
the ouster of Bendjedid personally, falling in line with the
widespread feeling that responsibility for the regime's failures
lies not with the president but with the ``fat cats'' conspiring to
obstruct his policies.
   The president has been the main advocate of an economic
austerity program permitting Algeria to live within its means
during a period of low prices for oil and gas, which make up 97
percent of Algeria's exports.
   Nearly 60 percent of Algeria's 25 million people are less than
20 years old. In the middle of the demographic explosion, Bendjedid
has fought opposition within the National Liberation Front, the
only legal party, to move away from a strictly government-directed
economy.
   Under the austerity program, prices on many formerly subsidized
goods have risen 40 percent since January. A block of butter that
cost 50 cents 10 months ago, for example, now costs almost a dollar.
   On Saturday, the army continued to move troops into the major
cities, and the military command issued repeated warnings for
people to remain off the streets.
   Shopkeepers took no chances and began lowering curtains and
barring shop fronts shortly after noon on Saturday. Algeria
operates on an Islamic week, and Saturday and Sunday are normally
working days.

   Homeowner Toni DeJonge can
empathize with state officials who say it's difficult to convince
people that colorless, odorless radioactive radon gas collecting in
their homes can be deadly.
   ``I brought it up last year at the voting booths and they
laughed me out onto the street. They said, `don't be ridiculous,
it's all a scam,''' said Ms. DeJonge. Tests conducted last year
found that her home had radon levels 45 times the federal safety
standard.
   Ms. DeJonge lives in the Whispering Hills development where
tests Sept. 30 found 60 of 75 homes had radon levels above the
federal safety standard. One home had levels 800 times greater then
the federal standard, possibly the highest ever recorded in a
house, officials said Thursday.
   Officials believe the gas in Clinton Township, a rural community
about 40 miles west of New York City, rises through the ground from
the Reading Prong, a formation of uranium-bearing rock that extends
from Pennsylvania into New York. Radon is produced by the
radioactive decay of uranium.
   Health officials say radon is second only to smoking as a cause
of lung cancer deaths.
   Last year, Ms. DeJonge installed a simple ventilation system in
her basement for $950 to alleviate the radon problem, and became
the town radon crier.
   She gave up after consistently meeting with derision from
neighbors who thought it was a hoax perpetrated by the burgeoning
radon remediation industry.
   The federal standard for radon is 4 picocuries, a unit of
radiation measurement. The federal Environmental Protection Agency
estimates that level is the annual equivalent of smoking one-half
pack of cigarettes a day or having 200 to 300 chest X-rays.
   One lhouse tested by the state Department of Environmental
Protection in the Whispering Hills development registered 3,500
picocuries. State officials said the unidentified homeowner was
having the problem corrected.
   State officials canvassed the neighborhood last weekend, urging
residents to place charcoal-filled canisters in their basements to
test for the gas.
   But at many homes, they met with slammed doors, suspicion,
reluctance, or skepticism. Others said they have tested, but put
off having work done to lower radon levels because they distrust
what may be hype.
   State officials say they continue to battle apathy despite
discoveries of 18 similar clusters in the state where radon is
seeping through house foundations and building to dangerous levels.
   Calls to a state radon hot line increase tenfold after flurries
of publicity, such as reports last month that 29 percent of homes
in seven states had elevated radon levels. But the calls quickly
drop off, officials said.
   ``It's not a problem you can see. It's not a problem that can be
associated with a man-made contamination problem. It's a natural
phenomenon that's been here all along,'' said David Martin, vice
president of Teledyne Isotopes, a radioactive testing firm. ``Radon
poses the highest risk to smokers, and if you can't convince people
to stop smoking it's going to be hard to interest them in radon.''

   Here is the text of Saturday's Democratic
radio address by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   This is Senator Pat Moynihan of New York, and I'm here to
present the Democratic response to President Reagan's weekly radio
address.
   This past year has been one of considerable, even historic,
bipartisan cooperation here in the nation's capital. We have sent
the president a hugely important trade bill, catastrophic health
insurance, and after one-half century, at long last, welfare reform.
   Mr. President, you've invited me to the Rose Garden Thursday
afternoon when you'll sign the welfare bill, and so I'll see you
then. But this is the last time we will have this exchange on a
Saturday, so I would like to talk about one last great bipartisan
effort we could have together.
   This is the Omnibus Drug Bill which we introduced in the Senate
on Monday. Today you talked about the House bill. I'll talk about
the Senate bill. May I say, we surprised ourselves. Over the last
few years, as the most recent drug epidemic has spread across the
nation, there have been all too familiar efforts to make this a
partisan issue, as if one party knew more about how to cope with
the emergency, or cared more, or would spend more, or would punish
more, or just plain demagogue more, most of which ended in
stalemate and name-calling.
   This time we decided we could do better. In May, Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd appointed me and Senator Nunn of Georgia to
head a Democratic working group. Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
appointed Senators Rudman, D'Amato, Wilson and Gramm to do
likewise. The two groups met, and we learned, to our surprise, just
how much we agreed.
   First, we agreed that there is an epidemic. It is primarily
associated with crack, a derivative of cocaine, which first
appeared in the Bahamas in 1983. By 1985, it had reached New York
City, by 1986 Kansas City, and then across the country. Since then,
hospital emergency room admissions due to illicit drugs have
increased ten-fold.
   One half of all juveniles in detention at this moment are the
result of drug-related crimes. Almost half of juveniles arrested
have been arrested at least five times. We agreed that the federal
government has a major responsibility here. These drugs come into
the country illegally. If the federal government did not prevent
their entry, it must help with their aftermath.
   First, then, a drug czar, a member of the Cabinet, to lead this
effort. Next, a real effort. Our interdiction program is pathetic
when you think what is needed. When we started the Drug Enforcement
Administration, we created some 2,100 special agents. Fifteen years
later, there are not quite 2,900. Federal aid to street law
enforcement has all but disappeared. There are not nearly enough
federal prosecutors or federal prisons.
   Above all, there is almost no federal support for treatment. We
don't know much about treatment for crack, but we do know that
young people who get into drugs soon wish they could get out, and
there are millions of them. One American in 10 has used an illicit
drug in the last month. Clearly we must provide treatment on
request. Whatever you do in an epidemic, you don't close your
hospitals.
   And so, Mr. President, on Monday we introduced a bipartisan
600-page, $2.6 billion drug bill. It marks a major departure in
federal policy. We allocate 40 percent of funds to the supply side,
which is to say, programs such as crop eradication and border
interdiction. There is a death penalty, eviction, forfeiture, a
three-time loser life sentence.
   But 60 percent of the funds go to the demand side _ testing,
education, treatment. Senator Byrd and Senator Dole are the lead
sponsors. Among the many co-sponsors, you will find Senator Quayle
and Senator Bentsen.
   We need your help. We have four legislative days left in the
100th Congress. We can't pass the House bill. It has just too many
extras, some of which you mentioned. But we can pass the Senate
bill, and the House will take a clean bill. And so I would ask, Mr.
President, send word that you will sign the Senate bill, and we'll
get it to your desk. And so good day. Good luck to us all.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   My fellow Americans, you're probably just as delighted as I am
with the wonderful news about unemployment that we received
yesterday. The unemployment rate dropped fully two-tenths of a
percent in September to 5.4 percent for all civilian workers and
5.3 percent when you include the military. But behind these numbers
is more good news _ 255,000 got new jobs last month in the non-farm
sector, which means that since the recovery began in 1982, over 18
million new jobs have been created. There's nothing more pleasing
than watching America move forward with purpose and the news
reminds us yet again that this great nation is, as Senator Dan
Quayle said, the envy of the world.
   Now, I'd like to turn to another subject, the war on drugs. I
want all Americans to take heart. This war is not yet won, not by a
long shot, but we're doing better and our nation is united against
this scourge as never before. Right now there is a drug bill on
Capitol Hill. It has passed the House but hasn't even come up for
consideration in the Senate and time is fast running out.
   The House bill has many good and tough provisions that express
our national commitment to five simple, but powerful, words. Those
words are ``zero tolerance'' and ``Just say no.'' When we say zero
tolerance, we mean simply that we've had it. We will no longer
tolerate those who sell drugs and those who buy drugs. All
Americans of good will are determined to stamp out those parasites
who survive and even prosper by feeding off the energy and vitality
and humanity of others. They must pay.
   We believe that when those who sell drugs are caught, they must
make redress for the damage they cause. That's why the
administration, personified by the leadership and passion of this
administration's point man on drugs, Vice President George Bush,
and the national voice of conscience, my wife Nancy, has advocated
tougher measures than ever before to combat the drug runners and
the drug dealers.
   We are doing this by seizing the ill-gotten possessions of drug
dealers and their accomplices. Those fancy cars and fancy houses
and bank accounts full of dirty money aren't really theirs. They
were bought from the sale of illegal blood pollutants. We do not
tolerate companies that poison our harbors and rivers, and we won't
let people who are poisoning the blood of our children get away
with it either.
   Those who have the gall to use federally subsidized housing to
peddle their toxins must get the message as well. We will not
tolerate those who think they can do their dirty work in the same
quarters where disadvantaged Americans struggle to build a better
life. We want to kick the vermin out and keep them out.
   Nor can we allow these people to hide behind bizarre legal
challenges when we do arrest them, and we must work to see them
jailed. And that's why we're advocating a change in the law that
will allow exceptions in the so-called ``exclusionary rule'' to
permit the use in court of evidence gathered in good faith by the
police. Nor can our vigilance cease once they're behind bars.
   George Bush has proposed, and I support, drug testing for all
who seek early release from jail, to send them this message, ``You
don't go free until you're drug free.'' We won't have a drug-free
society until we manage to stop the drugs before they get to our
shores. We must protect our coasts, and that means using the
resources and calling on the noble men and women of the Coast Guard
to protect us.
   We've sought increases in the drug enforcement budget, but in
the past we've encountered consistent resistance from Congress. I
requested $538 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration in
fiscal 1989, but Congress hacked $33 million away.
   I think drug enforcement is too important a matter for this kind
of political behavior, and I imagine you agree with me. But there
is a way more vital than all of these, that we can express our
revulsion at violence and degradation of the life of the drug
peddler. These people seem to feel nothing, no fear, no remorse,
nothing, when they pull out a machine gun and murder a police
officer in the line of duty.
   The bill that has passed the House provides for the death
penalty for these vicious killers. We must, we need, and we will
have this law. Now, there are those who've opposed the House bill
because it includes the death penalty. Others oppose it because of
the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.
   I believe these people are more concerned with the abstract
rights of criminals than the right of our society to save itself
from those, in this country and outside, who seek their fortune in
our national misfortune.
   I challenge the U.S. Senate to get that bill passed. The nation
demands it and there's no time to waste. Compromises on the key
provisions are unacceptable. We must let the drug kingpins know
your days are numbered. Our cause is just, and we will triumph.
   Until next week, thanks for listening. God bless you.

   A chemical cleanup crew planned to blow up a
rusting cylinder Sunday without knowing for sure what was inside or
if it could explode prematurely, and officials asked 3,500
residents to evacuate just in case.
   The 4-foot-long container at the defunct Artel Chemical Co.
plant could contain up to 30 pounds of hydrogen cyanide gas,
federal Environmental Protection Agency officials said.
   Hydrogen cyanide is one of the most poisonous substances made,
says Merck's Index, a directory of chemicals and drugs. As little
as 50 milligrams, or a quantity one-sixth the size of an aspirin,
can kill an adult, the book says.
   Sunday's plan was for three men to weigh the corroded tank,
carry it 100 yards to a bunker, split the sides with explosives and
start a gasoline-and-diesel fire to destroy the contents.
   But just moving the tank could trigger a reaction that would
cause an explosion before the men could reach the bunker, federal
officials said. The workers are from Jet Research Center Inc. of
Mansfield, Texas.
   As a precaution, the EPA and Mayor Don Karnes asked a third of
the town's 9,000 residents to stay away from their homes between
12:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. They planned to have 120 public officials on
hand, to bus residents to a school gymnasium and to evacuate the
elderly and handicapped to hospitals and nursing homes.
   ``A lot of people are callous toward this thing,'' Karnes said
Friday of residents of an area that has had chemical plants for
decades. ``They have been raised with chemicals and they don't see
anything wrong with this.
   ``I have asked them to go as a favor to me. I've known a lot of
these people for years. If they won't go, I've asked them to leave
their fingerprints and dental records (for identification).''
   If the cylinder is empty, all will be fine, said Jerry Heston of
the EPA, coordinator of the government's cleanup at the plant.
   ``The primary question is, `Is it full or empty or what?'''
Heston said.
   Chemical stabilizers added to the tank's contents may have
deteriorated and pressure inside may be slowly rising, Heston said.
   Hydrogen cyanide is used as a raw material by chemical
companies, forming the base for such things as acrylic waxes and
food packaging, and to kill rodents and insects in ship holds.
   A plan to destroy the cylinder Sept. 25 fell through and the
evacuation was called off when workers hired to move the container
balked. A new company was hired for Sunday's procedure.
   The Artel plant formerly was owned by Elmer Fike, a 35-year
maker of ``specialty chemicals.'' Fike openly criticized
environmental regulations, saying they were too restrictive, and
his plant often resembled a jerry-built brewery with rusted pipes
linking massive tanks.
   Artel bought the plant from Fike. When the company was unable to
pay workers, a judge ordered the plant shut. The EPA stepped in to
dispose of the 3,400 drums and barrels at the site.
   Nothing is known for certain about the tank slated for
destruction, except that it was built more than 20 years ago and
hasn't been moved or used in nearly seven years.
   ``It's probably a possibility'' that something else might be
inside, ``but Elmer (Fike) has told me that it has hydrogen cyanide
in it or nothing at all,'' Karnes said. ``I certainly have no
reason to doubt that.''
   If moving the tank triggers a reaction, the demolition experts
will have to act fast.
   ``If the cylinder starts getting hot, they will have a minute,
minute-and-a-half to put it down,'' Heston said. ``We've made
sandbag stands. They can just set it down, set up the detonation
cord, get off-site, put an airpack on and pop it.''
   ``Pop it'' means blowing one end off the tank, relieving
pressure and preventing a rupture that could send shrapnel into
other tanks at the site.
   ``We would then have hydrogen cyanide released to the
atmosphere,'' Heston said. ``We assume the whole 30 pounds would go
up in the air, and we've done air flow models to find out where it
would go. That's why we recommended the 1,000-yard evacuation
zone.''
   Forcing an evacuation hasn't been easy for Karnes.
   Some residents don't want to be bothered, either because of
their trust in the chemical industry in the heavily industrialized
Kanawha Valley, or because they agreed to leave their homes Sept.
25, when the operation was first scheduled but then canceled.
   Karnes says there are only three things that can cause another
cancellation _ bad weather, stagnant air or ``if not enough people
leave town.''
   ``I've had people calling from 1{ miles away asking me if they
should leave,'' Karnes said. ``I'm telling them they're perfectly
safe but that they can leave if they want to.
   ``I can't tell them to stay and then have a cloud go out and
kill 9,000 people.''

   Delegates to the organizing conference of a
Latvian nationalist group on Saturday criticized management of the
Latvian economy and protested Soviet control over the Baltic
republic, a source said.
   Janis Veveris, a former political prisoner monitoring live
broadcasts of the conference in the Latvian capital, Riga, on
state-run radio and television, said particularly harsh criticism
was leveled at management of the republic's industry and
agriculture.
   Speakers also complained about pollution in Latvia and about the
Soviet takeover of the republic in 1940, Veveris said.
   The remarks came on the first day of a two-day congress of the
People's Front of Latvia. The group is similar to organizations
formed in the neighboring Baltic republics of Estonia and Lithuania
to make nationalist demands and push Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms.
   The Estonian People's Front, claiming 60,000 members, held its
organizing conference Oct. 1-2, and Lithuania's is slated for Oct.
22-23.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said more than 1,000
delegates, including some members of the Communist Party, were
attending the meeting in Riga. It said the group has 130,000
members. Latvia's population is 2.6 million.
   Tass said among the participants was the new president of
Latvia, Anatoly Gorbunov, who assumed his post Thursday. Also
attending, the news agency said, were members of Latvia's Communist
Party Central Committee.
   On Friday, more than 100,000 Latvians braved a rainstorm in Riga
to demonstrate in favor of the People's Front, Veveris and Tass
reported.
   Tass said the demonstration had a festive air, with participants
arriving at the forested Riga park in national costume. Entire
families attended and enjoyed improvised concerts of folk music.
Veveris said these were nationalist songs recalling Latvia's brief
independence between the world wars.
   Veveris said demonstrators waved the yellow, green and red flag
that flew in Latvia during its independence.
   Protesters also carried posters saying ``No to Russification''
and ``No Occupation,'' referring to migration of Russians into the
republic and Soviet control over the region.

<TEXT>
   Federal Drug Administration tests on
candy believed to poisoned with strychnine were unable to identify
the substance and the agency is still investigating, an agency
spokesman said Saturday.
   A powder was found on a piece of candy in a package of Sunkist
Fun Fruits and Dinosaurs bought at a northern New Jersey grocery
store. Bergen County prosecutor Larry McClure said Friday that
state police laboratory tests had determined the powder was
strychnine.
   But FDA spokesman Edward Wilkens said the agency's lab in
Brooklyn, N.Y., was unable to confirm the powder was strychnine. He
said only a small piece of the candy in question was available for
testing, and officials were trying to determine why the results
from the two labs differed.
   ``Our lab isn't sure what it is,'' Wilkens said. ``They seem to
think they had enough, and if it was strychnine the lab workers
think they would have detected it.''
   FDA officials have completed an inspection of the Thomas H.
Lipton, Inc. plant in Flemington, where the candy was packaged, and
plants in California, Illinois and Oklahoma also will be inspected
for traces of strychnine, Wilkens said.
   The FBI is in charge of the investigation, he said.
   Lipton spokesman David St. Clair initially said the powder most
likely was harmless cornstarch that could have come from a mold,
which is made of cornstarch.
   McClure did not immediately respond to a message left at his
home.
   Strychnine is commonly used in rodent killer and may cause
deaths in small doses or can cause violent convulsions, loss of
muscle control, intense pain and impaired respiration.
   The candy in question was packaged Aug. 4, and the number on the
outside of the box is 8H04EF. Those boxes will still be recalled as
an extra precaution, St. Clair said.
   The batch was distributed in an area ranging from Massachusetts
to Florida and west to Ohio, McClure said Friday.
   Henry Heide Co. in New Brunswick made the candy for Lipton,
which packaged and distributed the boxes under the Sunkist label,
he said.

   President Reagan warned Congress on Saturday
that ``time is fast running out,'' and pressed the Senate to
approve a House-passed anti-drug bill before adjournment.
   Reagan, as he has in several other speeches during the past
week, said he supports the death penalty provision in the measure.
   But in the Democratic response, Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
praised the Senate's version as the better legislation and argued
the House bill ``has just too many extras.''
   ``The House bill has many good and tough provisions that express
our national commitment to five simple but powerful words _ those
words are `zero tolerance' and `Just say no,''' Reagan said,
lifting the slogan from his wife Nancy's anti-drug education
campaign.
   ``By zero tolerance, we mean simply, that we've had it,'' Reagan
said in his weekly radio address from Camp David, Md.
   ``We will no longer tolerate those who sell drugs and those who
buy drugs. All Americans of good will are determined to stamp out
those parasites who survive and even prosper by feeding off the
energy and vitality and humanity of others. They must pay,'' the
president said.
   Reagan said he supports moves to deny federal benefits to anyone
convicted of drug sales or use, user penalties and allowing the
admission in federal court of evidence seized illegally, but in
``good faith.''
   While the House passed its version of the legislation earlier
this month on a 375-30 vote, the measure has not yet come before
the Senate.
   ``We must, we need and we will have this law,'' the president
said. ``I challenge the U.S. Senate to get that bill passed.''
   Reagan pointed out that the House bill includes the death
penalty for those who authorize drug-related killings or anyone who
kills a law enforcement officer in a drug-related crime.
   Moynihan noted the Senate legislation also has the death penalty
provision but spends 60 percent of its $2.6 billion package to
reduce demand and only 40 percent for cutting supply.
   ``It marks a major departure in federal policy,'' noted Moynihan.
   The bill introduced in the Senate last Monday has wide
bipartisan backing, Moynihan noted, included the support of the GOP
vice president candidate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   As he has done in many radio addresses, Reagan put in a plug for
Vice President George Bush, calling the GOP presidential candidate
his ``point man'' on the administration's anti-drug fight.
   The president said he backed Bush's move to require that any
prisoner must be proven drug-free before being released from jail.
   ``You don't go free until you're drug free,'' Reagan said.
   Senators have been negotiating privately over crucial
time-limiting agreements that would enable Congress to pass the
anti-drug measure before adjournment, expected to come at the end
of this week.
   But they agree the Senate will run out of time if long debates
ensue over controversial issues such as the user penalties or the
admission of illegally seized evidence.
   Even if the Senate overcame its time obstacles, it still would
need time to reach a compromise with the House. And the measure,
even if enacted, faces serious financing problems.
   The Senate bill is a two-year package that would authorize about
$2 billion in new spending, but only $450 million may be available
immediately, according to several sponsors of the legislation.
   Moynihan urged Reagan to ``send word that you will sign the
Senate bill and we'll get it to your desk.''

<HEAD>`Siege of Atlanta' Ends With 40 More Arrests At Abortion Clinic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 40 abortion protesters Saturday
at the end of a five-day ``Siege of Atlanta'' that landed more than
450 demonstrators in jail but it was not clear who, if anyone, won.
   ``They'll be back and we'll be here every day they are,''
predicted Police Maj. Kenneth Burnette. Police were criticized for
rough handling of demonstrators on the first three days of the
week's protests but used gentler tactics on the last two days.
   More than 1,100 anti-abortion demonstrators have been jailed in
Atlanta since a group called Operation Rescue began picketing and
blocking entrances to abortion clinics during the Democratic
National Convention in July.
   The group has called a national ``Day of Rescue'' for Oct. 29
and hopes to have demonstrations in 100 cities.
   Operation Rescue said it would file a civil rights suit next
week in U.S. District Court against the city of Atlanta on behalf
of the Rev. Doyle Clark of Hudson, Ind., who said he suffered
serious injuries and inadequate medical attention when he was
arrested Tuesday.
   ``We would have liked to have more people come out but we feel
that we touched the hearts of Christians,'' said Operation Rescue
spokesman Bob Nolte. ``It was a pioneer effort and from that
aspect, we're pleased.''
   The movement ran low on people willing to go to jail, but more
arrived in Atlanta late in the week for Saturday's protest.
   Demonstration leaders claimed success through the week, saying
at least some of the women with appointments at the four clinics
they picketed were persuaded to change their minds.
   But a spokeswoman for the National Abortion Rights League
characterized the demonstrators as ``religious extremists who want
to impose their religious moral views on this entire country.''
   ``I think what they achieved is ... further alienating the
American public. The public abhors extremist tactics of
intimidation,'' said Kate Michelman, executive director of the
league, who was in Atlanta at the start of the week. She made her
remarks in Seattle.
   About 70 volunteers were on duty Saturday to take women through
the picket lines into the clinic.
   Police reminded demonstrators that they were violating an
injunction when they tried to persuade one woman not to enter the
clinic for an abortion.
   The injunction prohibits, among other things, the bothering or
harassing of people entering or leaving the clinics.
   Estimates varied about how many women were dissuaded from having
abortions during the week.
   Ignatius deBlasi, administrator of the Midtown Clinic where
there were 53 arrests Friday and 40 on Saturday, said about 80
percent of those with clinic appointments Friday kept them.
   Operation Rescue claims many of the women entering the clinic
were ``plants'' sent in to give the impression of normal operation.
   Demonstrators picketed the Atlanta Pretrial Detention Center
later Saturday to protest what they said was an intentional delay
in releasing protesters who posted bond. About 390 of those
arrested during the week remained in custody Saturday afternoon.
   But city officials, who warned earlier that those arrested would
be treated like other prisoners, said it would take days to process
the demonstrators out because their paperwork is not being
processed separately from other prisoners.
   ``(Operation Rescue founder) Randall Terry said they were coming
to paralyze the city government,'' said J.D. Hudson, Atlanta's
corrections director. ``They've lived up to their purpose to
overwhelm the criminal justice system.
   ``They tore up the tracks, now they're complaining because the
train won't roll.''

   Thousands of people living near an atomic
power plant fled in panic Saturday and squeezed onto trains leaving
the area when they mistook a drill for a real emergency, officials
said.
   At least 25,000 people living near the Tarapur Atomic Power
Plant fled after authorities declared an emergency at 5.20 a.m. and
carried out a check of evacuation procedures within a 10-mile
radius of the plant, officials said.
   The Tarapur plant, set up in 1969, is 75 miles north of Bombay.
It is India's oldest nuclear power plant.
   G.B. Pingulkar, the top government official in the area, said at
least 25,000 people fled, despite announcements beforehand that a
drill to test emergency responses would be held.
   ``People came to me asking if the plant was leaking,'' Pingulkar
said. ``I was surprised.''
   An official at the Boisar Railway Station about a mile from
Tarapur said thousands of panic-stricken residents crowded into
trains bound for Bombay after the emergency warning. ``Ticket sales
were at least four times the daily average,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The panic spread also to industries in Tarapur town and many
factories closed due to absenteeism.

<HEAD>FBI: Fugitive Financial Planner Found In Taiwan, Arrested In Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRACY FIELDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A financial planner who disappeared with $25
million and left notes of apology for his former clients was
arrested as a fugitive Saturday in Japan after being expelled from
Taiwan, FBI agents said.
   Henry Gherman, 52, has been a federal fugitive since August on
charges of embezzlement and mail fraud.
   When he was arrested by FBI agents when he got off a plane in
Tokyo, Gherman was carrying $20,000 to $30,000 in U.S. money and
``a sizable amount of Taiwanese currency,'' said FBI agent William
Wells, in charge of the agency's Miami office.
   Gherman is accused of masterminding a scheme that may have
swindled nearly 50 investors, U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said in
a federal complaint filed Aug. 29 in federal court.
   ``Many of the victims were employees of his own firm,'' Wells
said.
   Gherman sent hand-written notes of apology to his clients when
he dropped out of sight Aug. 10.
   In addition to individual investors, Gherman had a
``longstanding pattern of embezzlement'' from about 25 professional
associations handling pension funds and other assets for members,
Lehtinen said.
   He added that the investigation of Gherman's activities
continues and additional charges are expected to be filed. He
declined to give details.
   Attorneys for a group of investos who have filed a civil suit
against Gherman said up to $25 million is missing from client
accounts.
   ``We think we'll be successful in locating some of those
funds,'' Wells said. ``We don't know how much. We just don't know
how much is left.''
   Gherman made telephone calls to his wife and to Miami attorneys
after his disappearance, but authorities did not know his
whereabouts until U.S. citizens in Taiwan reported his possible
location there, agents said. Authorities then found him and
arranged his expulsion, said Wells.
   Wells said Gherman could be brought back to Miami within a week.
But if he fights extradition, the process could take as many as 45
days, he said.
   Gherman is accused of illegally transferring clients' money to a
Miami bank account since 1978 and issuing false statements
indicating investments in money-market funds and certificates of
deposit, Lehtinen said in the federal complaint.
   The complaint cites five counts of embezzlement and two counts
of mail fraud. Gherman faces 35 years in prison and fines in excess
of $1.5 million if convicted on all counts, Lehtinen said.

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis is trying in advance to take the steam out of what he says
are planned National Rifle Association radio commercials in North
Carolina distorting his position on gun control.
   ``It's another outrageous distortion of what I believe,''
Dukakis said. ``I've always supported the right of hunters and
sportsmen to have weapons and use them, and people to defend
themselves in their homes subject ... to state law.''
   He added, ``What I'm concerned about is teen-agers with AK-47s
and Uzis that are driving around cities in this country killing
people, and cop-killer bullets and undetectable plastic guns which
are threatening the safety of people.''
   Dukakis discussed the gun-control issue in an interview Friday
after delivering a campaign speech in this mountain city.
   His state campaign spokeswoman, Amy DeHart, said Dukakis wanted
an opportunity to clarify his stand on gun control before Monday,
when Ms. DeHart said the NRA ads would begin running.
   ``They've made a major buy (of air time) for these ads ... total
distortions of the governor's position,'' Ms. DeHart said.
   The NRA also has sent letters to its North Carolina members
criticizing Dukakis as a gun-control advocate, she said.
   David W. Conover, a federal liaison with the Washington-based
NRA, declined to discuss the organization's advertising strategy
and said he did not know whether the group would run anti-Dukakis
commercials in North Carolina.
   But Conover said the NRA was spreading the word nationwide that
Dukakis had favored restrictions on gun ownership in Massachusetts.
   ``Throughout his political career, Governor Dukakis has been
openly hostile to private firearms ownership,'' Conover said in a
telephone interview.
   He said Dukakis supported a 1976 proposal to ban private
ownership of pistols and revolvers in Massachusetts. The measure
failed in a statewide referendum, he said.
   Conover said Dukakis had modified his stand since entering the
presidential race, but that the NRA still feared he would support
gun control as president.
   Dukakis, in the interview, said, ``If somebody runs these
commercials ... then obviously I am going to fight back. And I'm
not only going to fight back to clear up the the record; I'm going
to make sure that people in this country really understand how bad
(George) Bush's record has been on crime and drugs.''
   Ms. DeHart said she had seen scripts of the ads, including one
featuring actor Charlton Heston criticizing Dukakis on gun control
and a Massachusetts prison furlough program.

   One of two people killed when thousands
celebrated the defeat of President Augusto Pinochet was buried
Saturday, and the priest denounced the disappearance of dissidents
during the general's 15-year rule.
   Fourteen-year-old Luis Silva Jara ``was killed in the streets.
God doesn't like that,'' the Rev. Roberto Bolton said in a eulogy
before about 60 people at the Silva home.
   The boy was killed by an unidentified gunman Thursday, one day
after Chileans voted to reject Pinochet's bid to extend his rule
until 1997.
   Bolton criticized the torture and disappearance of government
opponents since Pinochet toppled the elected government of
President Salvador Allende, a Marxist, who died in the 1973 coup.
   Human rights groups estimate 700 people have been killed and
thousands tortured since Pinochet, the army commander, took power.
   Carlos Morales Alvarez, 31, the only other known death from the
anti-government demonstrations, was to be buried Sunday. Police
acknowlege they shot and killed Morales.
   Police also said at least 19 people leaving a huge rally staged
by opposition groups Friday were injured by soldiers firing
birdshot and pellets. One remained hospitalized at the Neurological
Institute with an eye injury, Radio Cooperativa reported.
   One American photographer was hospitalized and journalists from
several other nations walked around with bruises and bandages from
blows and kicks by police during the demonstrations.
   ``I expect to be out of here on Monday,'' said Liliana Nieto
Delrio, 31, of the Long Island-based newspaper Newsday. Ms. Nieto
said she was clubbed on the head by police and then kicked
repeatedly in the back as she lay on the ground.
   The incident occurred after dark Friday when police dispersed a
crowd of several hundred youths who left the rally and tried to
stage a demonstration near the national palace.
   A delegation of foreign journalists delivered a protest to the
National Police on Saturday. It said police attacks on more than 20
journalists in the demonstrations were unprovoked.
   After meeting the delegation, Police Col. Ivan Gonzalez said,
``There have been isolated cases'' of police attacks on reporters,
``but that type of behavior does not reflect national police
policy.''
   ``Orders have been issued again this morning that incidents like
that are not to happen again,'' Gonzalez said.
   Opposition leaders are pressing Pinochet to modify the 1980
constitution that set up Wednesday's referendum and that allows
Pinochet to remain in power through March 1990 despite his defeat.
   Presidential and congressional elections now are scheduled for
December 1989. Opposition leaders and many Chileans want them held
sooner. Pinochet has refused.

   A real estate salesman tired of
Midwest-bashing wants to give a recently introduced ``Beverly Hills
High School'' fashion line a run for its money with his own Peoria
High School getups.
   Fred Wolferman's idea for the Peoria clothing came from his
impression that residents of this Illinois River city of 120,000,
and the entire Midwest, get no respect from people living on the
East Coast or in California.
   ``I've traveled to both coasts and the perspective seems to be
that there's nothing between New York and Los Angeles,'' said
Wolferman, who lives in Kansas City, Mo. ``It's like the Midwest
doesn't exist. It really frustrates me.''
   The Peoria School Board last week sold him the rights to Peoria
High's logo.
   ``Peoria is a true heartland city,'' he said. ``Its name has all
the right connotations. I want to make it a competition and see
which is more popular, the heartland or the West Coast. If we
position it that way, the heartland is going to win.''
   Wolferman said the idea came to him when he read a newspaper
article about the Beverly Hills fashion line in which Shannon
Richey of the San Diego-based Lucas Enterprises Inc. said: ``People
are looking for something that has a lifestyle attached to it. This
is the closest most kids in Peoria will ever feel they're part of
the Beverly Hills High School attitude.''

   Brian Corson says his sewer-cleaning job has
its rewards. He's retrieved at least 10 gold and silver necklaces,
a pair of gold earrings and a silver bracelet while on the job.
   ``The necklaces that are in good shape, I give to my wife,''
said Corson, who vacuums debris from sewers in 20 suburban
communities.
   Corson uses a small sifter he built to help him sort through the
debris and occasionally sprays water on the debris looking for
items while his truck is emptied at refuse dumps.
   After five year, he's become selective.
   ``I don't even mess with it anymore unless it's gold,'' he said.
   Among other items, Corson has found a 1951 10-centavos coin from
Argentina, a 1918 British penny, a signet ring with the initial C,
a 1914 class ring, an old police badge, a 1922 trolley token and
ornate silver spoons.
   Even without the gold and silver, the job has benefits.
   ``It's never boring,'' he said. ``A different town every day,
different people every day and no boss breathing down your back
every day.''

   The armed forces dismissed a general and
four other officers for allowing cocaine worth $10 million to be
smuggled out of Bolivia, the military high command said Saturday.
   The dishonorable discharges came one day after officials
announced the discovery and destruction of a jungle cocaine
laboratory that produced tens of millions of dollars of drugs.
   Former Gen. Gustavo Arrazola and the four officers were accused
of protecting a clandestine airstrip in the Chapare coca leaf
producing region. The high command said nearly four tons of cocaine
paste _ worth at least $10 million _ were smuggled out of the
airstrip.
   The identities of the other officers were not immediately
available.
   The military did not say how long the airstrip was believed to
have operated.
   Planes took off from the airstrip for the Beni and Santa Cruz
regions where labs converted the cocaine paste into cocaine, and
the officers were paid to protect the traffickers, the high command
says.
   No figure was given for the payments.
   ``President Victor Paz Estenssoro, in learning of these
irregularities, ordered an in-depth investigation and the
prosecution of officers involved,'' said Gen. Romulo Mercado
Garnica, the army commander.
   Last week, the government also announced it arrested one judge
and was investigating reports that others had received money from
traffickers in return for the prisoners' release from prison.
   The impoverished South American country of 6.7 million produces
an estimated one third of the cocaine that reaches the United
States and Europe.
   Police and U.S. drug agents said that the drug lab destroyed
Thursday was the biggest ever discovered in Bolivia. Interior
Minister Juan Carlos Duran said the lab produced 3.5 tons of pure
cocaine a week.
   Twelve Bolivian anti-drug police and U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents discovered the lab on a helicopter sweep over
sparsely populated jungle 400 miles northeast of La Paz, the
Interior Ministry said.
   The United States has had a DEA and military presence in Bolivia
since July 1986 when 175 U.S. troops spent three months assisting
Bolivian police in anti-drug operations.
   The DEA describes the anti-drug operations in Bolivia as the
most effective in South America. In the past year, police said they
have destroyed 2,000 cocaine processing pits, 12 cocaine processing
labs and captured eight tons of cocaine paste.
   At least 35 U.S. military and navy trainers now work with
Bolivian police, navy and air force pilots. DEA and Border Patrol
agents also assist in anti-drug operations and train the 700-man
Leopard police force operating in the Chapare and Beni regions.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most U.S. companies are ignoring President
Reagan's order to pay taxes owed Panama into a Treasury Department
escrow account established to pressure strongman Manuel Noriega to
resign, U.S. officials say.
   Reagan last April ordered U.S. companies with offices in Panama
to withhold taxes they owe its government and instead pay them into
the U.S. escrow account. The idea was that the money would be
turned over to Panama once Noriega has resigned or been forced from
office.
   Six months later, that Treasury Department account remains
nearly empty as U.S. companies routinely ignore the order to pay
into it, according to a member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said senior State Department
officials told him they estimate that the escrow account is $65
million short of what it should be at this point.
   Gejdenson gave no figures on how much money is in the account.
But other congressional sources, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said it contained only $3.9 million, a figure that one
administration official described as ``in the ballpark.''
   Some U.S. businesses have told the administration they did not
want to pay into the account out of fears there were insufficient
accounting controls to keep track of how much each company paid,
said Peter Secor, a Panamanian specialist at the State Department.
   Secor said the Treasury Department, not the State Department,
keeps records on who pays and how much. Gejdenson said Treasury
Department officials have refused his repeated requests for that
information.
   Reagan's order was in two parts: the first that U.S. companies
do not pay the Noriega government and, second, that the money be
placed in the Treasury Department fund.
   ``Regardless of the second part, most if not all are complying
with the first,'' Secord said, adding that the administration had
put the most priority on keeping the money out of the Noriega
regime's hands.
   That explanation has been greeted with skepticism on Capitol
Hill, partly because the Panamanian government is allowing U.S.
companies to continue operating there.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if (the companies) continue to pay''
taxes to Panama, said Kathleen M. Bertelsen, a Gejdenson foreign
policy adviser. ``I just doubt Noriega lets them stay there without
paying.''
   But Secor said Noriega simply cannot afford, politically or
economically, to throw American corporations out.
   ``They don't want business confidence to erode anymore,'' he
said. ``It's important for the Noriega government to create the
impression of normalcy.''
   Secor also rejected the notion that Noriega is not applying
pressure on the American firms, saying that Panamanian officials
have used legal, financial and physical threats to try to get the
tax money.
   U.S. businessmen have reported threats such as ```You're going
to be in trouble,' or even `You're family is going to be in trouble
if you don't pay you're company's taxes','' Secor said.
   Gejdenson, in an interview Friday, said administration officials
have refused repeated invitations to testify at subcommittee
hearings to discuss the escrow account because the revelations
would be an embarrassment to Vice President George Bush and his
presidential campaign.
   ``It's one more demonstration that they've blown it,'' the
Democratic lawmaker said.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and his 85-year-old
mother lashed back at George Bush on Saturday, angrily responding
to Bush's barrage of attacks on Dukakis' crime record and citing
their family's own suffering from violent crime.
   It was a moment of rare public emotion by Dukakis, who spoke of
the beating and robbery of his father at age 77, and the killing of
his brother Stelian by a hit-and-run driver at the age of 43.
   It was made even more so by the presence of the candidate's
mother Euterpe, who offered her own impassioned defense of her son.
She accused Bush of ``mangling the truth, of trying to divide us,''
of suggesting that as the son of immigrants Dukakis ``does not love
the flag quite as much,'' and of being behind letters sent to
residents of a Massachusetts town saying her brothers were
communists.
   ``Can anyone get this low?'' Dukakis' mother said.
   Campaigning on the Bates College campus where his mother and
father attended school, the Democratic presidential nominee
responded forcefully to Bush's charges _ escalated a day earlier _
that Dukakis had shown insensitivity to the victims of crime. He
said Bush was trying to divert attention from his own ``pathetic
record'' in the Reagan administration on drugs and crime.
   Bush has hammered the Massachussetts governor repeatedly over a
case in which convicted murderer Willie Horton attacked a Maryland
couple after failing to return from a furlough from a Massachusetts
prison. One of the victims of that crime have campaigned on Bush's
behalf.
   Dukakis also renewed his criticism of Bush's running mate Dan
Quayle, saying Bush has ``been running away from his choice for
vice president'' since the vice presidential debate last Wednesday,
which polls and pundits judged Quayle to have lost.
   ``Remember what he said,'' Dukakis said, recalling Bush's
comments before he selected Quayle as his running mate. ``He said,
`Watch my vice presidential decision. That will tell all.'
   ``It sure does,'' Dukakis added. ``George, you can try and run
from that decision, but you can't hide it. And you can't run away
from your own record of failure by exploiting a human tragedy for
your own political ends.''
   Dukakis, in responding to the Horton case, cited examples of
similar acts of violence committed by inmates freed from the
federal prison system, from the California prison system when
Ronald Reagan was governor, and from a Houston halfway house that
Bush has supported and praised.
   ``I don't need any lectures from Mr. Bush on crime-fighting or
on the sensitivity of compassion we must extend to the victims of
crime,'' said Dukakis.
   ``Unlike Mr. Bush, I've been a chief executive on the front
lines of fighting crime,'' Dukakis said. ``Unlike Mr. Bush, who
will not take responsibility for anything, I as chief executive
took full responsibility for that tragic Horton case and acted to
change that policy, and Mr. Bush knows it.''
   He said that under Reagan in California, a police officer and
school teacher were murdered by inmates on furlough. He added,
``Unlike Mr. Bush, Governor Reagan took full responsibility.''
   He said thousands of drug dealers are furloughed from federal
prisons every year, and that he is seeking extradition of a
convicted bank robber who was paroled from federal prison and is
wanted to stand trial in the murder of a Boston police officer.
   In the Houston case, he said one inmate raped and murdered a
minister's wife after leaving the halfway house. He said Bush
``even presented that halfway house with a presidential award _
after the tragedy occurred.''
   ``So why are we being treated these last few days to a fresh
assault on the Horton case by Mr. Bush?'' Dukakis said. ``I think
we know why. Because of his own pathetic record in the fight
against crime and drugs.''
   Dukakis and his mother spoke to a crowd of several thousand
people inside a gym at Bates College. The crowd at the school of
1,500 students was swelled by the college's annual parents' day.
The college was where his mother, who came to the United States
from Greece at age 9, graduated with honors in 1925. Dukakis'
father Panos attended the school for one year, in 1919, before
transferring to Harvard Medical School.
   Euterpe Dukakis, offering her defense against Bush's charges,
said her son ``is fighting a very, very difficult enemy, opponent.
Unfortunately, this opponent tries everything possible. So far we
have not answered very much.''
   Her husband died in 1979, six years after the attack on him.

<HEAD>Hundreds Return To Palm Springs Homes After Cloud Passes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three emergency workers were
hospitalized and several hundred people were evacuated from their
homes when a fire at a swimming pool supply company created a cloud
of chlorine gas, authorities said.
   The workers were released Saturday from Desert Hospital and no
serious injuries were reported in this desert resort, said police
Sgt. Tom Barton.
   The fire at Ocean Pool Mart broke out Friday evening, and
residents were asked to leave a 1-square-mile area, including Palm
Springs Regional Airport.
   Arriving commercial and private flights were diverted to Ontario
Airport, some 50 miles to the west. Outgoing flights were canceled
and the airport was evacuated, said city spokeswoman Barbara Erdman.
   The exact number of evacuees was not determined, but 150 people
went to an evacuation center at Raymond Cree Junior High School.
   Barton said people were allowed to return home about 9:30 p.m.
   Several people complained of breathing difficulty and eye
irritation, but no one other than the emergency workers was
hospitalized, Barton said.
   ``I could smell the chlorine in the air. It made my nose burn
and it gave me a slight headache,'' said Hazel Reed of Bakersfield,
who was vacationing in Palm Springs.
   ``When my chest started hurting, that's when I decided to leave
my home,'' said Donna Winters, who said her daughter also had chest
pains.
   Nina Smith said she at first ignored a police call to evacuate
her home because she was afraid to venture out on foot.
   ``I stayed because I have no car. I put towels on the floor in
front of the door so that nothing could seep through,'' Ms. Smith
said. Eventually she called a friend to drive her to the evacuation
center.

   About 100,000 people waving

government austerity measures, police said.
   The demonstration by the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions, the

recent years but produced no incidents or arrests, a police

   The government announced last month during its budget

percent and was unlikely to fall much in the next year while its

   Michael Dukakis, temper rising as he recalled violence against
his own family, accused George Bush on Saturday of ``shameless''
use of crime victims to win votes. Bush touted a police endorsement
but found himself sidetracked to another issue, denying he was
running away from his running mate.
   Bush defended Dan Quayle, his choice for vice president, and
said he was tired of ``erroneous reporting'' that he was trying to
distance himself from the Indiana senator.
   Quayle was the only one of the top four candidates off the
campaign trail Saturday, and Lloyd Bentsen, still basking in the
glow of his apparent debate victory over Quayle last Wednesday,
said, ``I'm beginning to wonder where is Dan Quayle. Did he leave a
forwarding address when he left Omaha?''
   Democrat Dukakis, who had kept quiet in recent weeks as
Republican Bush struck again and again at what he said was the
Massachusetts governor's ``revolving-door'' policy on weekend
furloughs for dangerous criminals, lashed back on Saturday.
   Bush was ``exploiting a human tragedy for political ends,''
Dukakis said in a speech that aides said he wrote by hand the
previous night after being told of the Bush campaign's latest
efforts to win votes using the case of Willie Horton.
   Horton, a convicted murderer, failed to return from a
Massachusetts furlough in 1986 and in early 1987 attacked a
Maryland couple after breaking into their house. Bush, accusing
Dukakis of ``astounding insensitivity'' toward crime victims,
described the attack at length on Friday, and one of the victims,
Cliff Barnes, flew to California to give campaign speeches and make
radio ads for Bush.
   Dukakis, citing crimes against his father and brother, told his
audience Saturday at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, ``I don't
need any lectures from Mr. Bush on crime fighting or on the
sensitivity or compassion we must extend to the victims of crime.''
   ``Unlike Mr. Bush, I've been a chief executive on the front
lines of fighting crime. Unlike Mr. Bush, who will not take
responsibility for anything, I as chief executive took full
responsibility for that tragic Horton case and acted to change that
policy, and Mr. Bush knows it.''
   ``So let's look at the facts and stop this shameless playing of
politics with the tragedy of a crime.''
   Dukakis said his father was beaten, robbed and left bound at age
77 and that his brother Stelian was killed by a hit-and-run driver.
   The Democrat also said that when Ronald Reagan was governor of
California, a police officer and school teacher were murdered by
inmates on furlough. And he said that under the Reagan
administration, the federal prison system ``has granted thousands
of furloughs to drug pushers and drug traffickers.''
   Dukakis also cited Bush's role in supporting a halfway house in
Houston, where one of the inmates left the house ``and raped and
murdered a minister's wife.''
   He was joined by his 85-year-old mother, Euterpe, who offered
her own impassioned comments. She accused Bush of ``mangling the
truth, of trying to divide us,'' of suggesting that as the son of
immigrants Dukakis ``does not love the flag quite as much,'' and of
being behind letters sent to residents of a Massachusetts town
saying her brothers were communists.
   ``Can anyone get this low?'' she asked.
   Earlier Saturday, in Washington, Bush kept his own focus on the
law-and-order issue, accepting the endorsement of the head of the
national Fraternal Order of Police.
   He made no mention of Quayle during the event.
   Afterward, Bush was turning to leave but then came back to say
heatedly that he was getting ``a little tired of erroneous
reporting'' that has noted his relative lack of comment on Quayle
since the debate in Omaha, Neb.
   ``This concept that I see in some of these reports that I am not
supportive of Dan Quayle are absolutely ludicrous,'' he said.
``They are ridiculous. He did well in that debate. He has my full
support ... and I made a good decision'' in selecting the Indiana
senator as running mate.
   The police organization's president, Dewey Stokes, said earlier
that he was endorsing Bush, whom he called ``the law enforcement
candidate.''
   A news release from the Bush campaign touted the 197,000-person
membership of the organization, but Stokes acknowledged he was
giving only his personal support, not that of the group, which has
not taken a position.
   Bush's campaign speeches have been emphasizing his stance that
Dukakis is soft on crime, a point the vice president has tried to
underscore with several public endorsements by law enforcement
officials. Dukakis has responded with similar endorsements from
other police groups.
   In Houston on Saturday, Bentsen was trying to keep the focus on
Quayle.
   ``They have chosen a candidate that the imagemakers and the poll
takers thought could be packaged and sold to the American people.
That's supposed to be the very latest, the most productive of
tactics by these imagemakers and it just didn't wash. The American
people are not buying it. You have to have more substance there
than that.''
   Noting President Reagan's defense of Quayle on Friday, Bentsen
said, ``I think the best review I received on the debate was from
the Oval Office itself, when they brought out the great
communicator to try to bring about some kind of damage control.''

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen promised Saturday to make George Bush ``face the
music'' for choosing Dan Quayle for the Republican ticket.
   Bentsen, contending his debate with the Indiana senator
Wednesday night was ``the turning point'' for the Democrats, said
at a Houston news conference that ``the Republicans have now tried
to turn the subject away from the debate, to not talk about Dan
Quayle.''
   ``In fact, I'm beginning to wonder, where is Dan Quayle? Did he
leave a forwarding address when he left Omaha?'' asked Sen.
Bentsen, who was wrapping up a three-day swing through his home
state on Saturday.
   Later in the day, making a quick trip to the Navajo Nation in
neighboring New Mexico, Bentsen continued to brag about his debate
performance.
   ``Dan Quayle has a different perspective than he had last
Wednesday night,'' he said.
   Bentsen, with Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., stood waving on the
tailgate of a Secret Service van as he rode into Shiprock along a
two and one-half mile parade route for the town's 65th annual fair.
Tens of thousands of people were there for the parade, and some ran
up to grab Bentsen's hand when they found out who he was.
   He watched an Indian dance demonstration and met with tribal
leaders. He told the crowd that the Democrats stood for more and
better rural health, education and development programs, and that
the Republicans had cut such programs back.
   The Democrats are hoping a strong vote from the reservations
will help them win New Mexico in November.
   From New Mexico, Bentsen was returning to Texas to end his trip
with a pair of appearances in El Paso, on the far western end of
the state.
   ``George Bush may try to run away from his running mate, but he
really can't hide,'' Bentsen said at his Houston news conference.
   ``While the Republicans are running from the issues, and running
from Dan Quayle, we don't intend to let them change the tune; we're
going to see that they face the music,'' Bentsen said.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has been facing
the music in Texas on the issues of crime and gun control in a
barrage of Republican ads portraying him as a coddler of criminals
who wants to disarm honest citizens. Bentsen attacked what he said
were distortions of Dukakis' record, and said Texas would see
through them.
   ``Texans won't buy a bill of goods on gun control from a man who
wanted to sell Hawk missiles to the ayatollah,'' he said.
   Bentsen denied Republican assertions that the Democrats had
given up on winning the South.
   ``That is obviously not true. It sounds like some of his
comments during the debate. Not true at all,'' he said.
   ``I was in North Carolina the other day and they tell me we're
ahead there. I was in Tennessee, they said that's a dead heat. I
think we're ahead in Arkansas. We've seen a nice improvement here
in Texas (where) the momentum is back in our direction,'' he said,
citing a recent poll showing the ticket only five points behind.
   Bentsen also discussed his relationship with the late President
John F. Kennedy, which some have questioned since Bentsen said that
they were friends. He said that during the debate just before
telling Quayle he was ``no Jack Kennedy.''
   Bentsen, who served in the House with Kennedy, said he was the
Massachusetts senator's finance chairman in Houston when Kennedy
ran for president. He also said he received from Kennedy an
inscribed copy of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ``Profiles in
Courage.''
   Kennedy invited him to his wedding, Bentsen said, but he was
already scheduled to make a speech in south Texas and missed it.
   ``If I had known he was going to be president, I'd have gone,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   An estimated 20,000 Ukrainian-Americans
marched from the shadow of the Washington Monument to the Soviet
Embassy to deliver an appeal to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
for religious freedom in the Ukraine.
   The protesters, who walked the 2.7-mile route to the strains of
a World War II Ukrainian freedom fighter's march, carried signs
that said ``Free our Churches in the Ukraine.''
   The group, led by a youth in a priest's robe carrying a gold and
silver crucifix, was so large that the first part of the
demonstration was leaving the embassy before the end left the
pre-march rally site, police said.
   U.S. Park Police estimated the crowd at 20,000.
   The march was one of several events this weekend in the United
States and Canada commemorating the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity in the Ukraine, where followers were baptized in the
city of Kiev in 988, according to National Ukrainian Millennium
Committee official Bohan Futey.
   In the letter for Gorbachev delivered to the embassy, the
organization asked for legalization of the Ukrainian Catholic and
Ukrainian Orthodox churches, which were outlawed by Joseph Stalin.
   Futey said his organization was demanding that the Soviets live
up to the religious freedom tenets of the Soviet constitution and
other international agreements.
   ``We are demanding the restoration, the opening of the Ukrainian
Orthodox and Ukrainian Catholic churches, as well as a stop to the
harassing of our brethren, be they Baptist or Pentecostal,'' he
said.
   ``Right now the people that practice the Catholic religion are
put in jail, they have to practice clandestinely. They have to meet
in the forest, in basements and at night,'' he said.
   He said there are about 50 million Ukrainians in the Soviet
Union, the majority _ 45 million _ living in the Ukraine. At least
40 million of those in the Ukraine consider themselves members of
the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Futey said.
   The group also leveled a protest over what it termed ``the
continuing destruction of Ukraine by Russification,'' in which
Ukrainian history and culture is being appropriated as Russian to
create a pretense of unification, he said.

   A new trade federation for education
workers was created Saturday, making it the third independent union
to be established in Communist Hungary since May, the state news
agency MTI reported.
   The news agency said 195 delegates attended the founding meeting
on behalf of the 30,000 Hungarian teachers employed in higher
education.
   According to its draft constitution, the new union is to be an
independent, democratic organization so it can more effectively
represent teaching professionals, the agency said.
   Delegates were reported to have criticized the ``hierarchic and
bureaucratic character'' of former trade unions and poor pay and
working conditions in the field. They also warned of the danger of
underestimating teachers' scholarly work, MTI said.
   Filmmakers, television and video art workers earlier this month
set up an independent Motion Picture Democratic Union called MODESZ.
   The first independent union, the Democratic Union of Scientific
Workers, was founded in May following widespread complaints about
official unions' failure to prevent cuts in state subsidies for
academic work.

<HEAD>Unsolved Serial Killings May Link Seattle, San Diego</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wendy Lee Coffield's strangled body was found
dumped in the Green River south of Seattle in 1982. This year, the
scattered remains of Peri Suzette Farmer were found in rural San
Diego County.
   Some 1,700 miles and six years separates the slayings, but task
forces in Washington and California are trying to determine whether
an elusive murderer's path can be traced between them _ a path
marked by up to 56 other deaths and disappearances.
   Coffield, 16, was the first victim linked to the so-called Green
River serial killer, who is officially blamed for the murders of 40
women in Washington and Oregon.
   On Sept. 27, a San Diego County Sheriff's Department
spokesperson said the department had identified Farmer, 22, and
that her death was being investigated by a 10-member task force
formed to investigate the killings and any possible link to the
Green River case.
   Police blame the disappearances of eight others in Washington
and Oregon on the same killer, who preyed mostly on prostitutes and
transients until the slayings appeared to end in March 1984.
   The San Diego task force is looking into the deaths of women,
dating back to June 1985, whose bodies were dumped throughout the
county and whose murders seem to fit the pattern of the Green River
killings.
   Lt. Bill Baxter, head of the San Diego Sheriff's Department
homicide unit, has said up to a dozen cases may be related.
   ``It's a possibility,'' Baxter said this summer. ``I wouldn't
say it's remote. But it hasn't risen to a conclusive statement that
there's a linkage.''
   ``The lead detectives in this case believe the Green River
killer is responsible for some of the killings in San Diego,'' a
Green River Task Force detective told The San Diego Union newspaper
in August.
   San Diego sheriff's spokeswoman Sgt. Liz Foster said two men
arrested in connection with attacks on prostitutes are being
investigated.
   No one contacted Saturday at either the sheriff's office or the
police department knew about the status of the investigation.
   Similarities exist among the cases:
   _Most victims were strangled, had backgrounds in prostitution or
drug use and were transients.
   _Most of the Seattle victims were found near an area called
Pacific Highway South, which is dotted with motels and bars popular
with prostitutes. Most of the San Diego victims were found near or
along El Cajon Boulevard, an area much like the Seattle strip.
   _In Seattle, the killer dumped a number of his victims in wooded
areas 30 to 40 miles from the city. In San Diego, many of the
bodies were left on secondary roads within 75 miles of the city.
   _The Green River series appears to have ended in 1984, after
police began heavy enforcement efforts against men patronizing
prostitutes. The San Diego series began in 1985.
   Self-described streetwalkers on El Cajon Boulevard say they are
aware of the killings.
   ``The police let us know how many girls are missing or if one is
found,'' said one woman, who identified herself as Christy, 18,
from Washington, D.C.
   She said the police also have warned prostitutes to be careful
of whom they solicit for business. ``The fear's there,'' she added.
   In Seattle, it wasn't until two years after Coffield's body was
found, and many killings later, that a task force was formed.
   King County Police Capt. Bob Evans, head of the Green River Task
Force, believes a more concerted effort in the beginning could have
ended the Seattle spree.
   ``If we knew back in '82-'83 what we know now, then all of these
killings wouldn't have happened,'' he said.

<HEAD>Mexico Says OPEC Price War Crowding It Out Of U.S. Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico says an OPEC price war is crowding it
out of its No. 1 market _ the United States.
   Beginning this month, OPEC governments have offered extra price
concessions to customers and moved to undercut non-cartel
competitors, including Mexico, the government oil monopoly Pemex
said Friday.
   Coupled with overproduction, the concessions ``have initiated an
undeclared, intense competition in prices among countries in the
Persian Gulf that decided to maintain or increase their market
participation, searching for new clients and seeking to displace
established commercial flows,'' Pemex said in a statement.
   Pemex on Friday announced price reductions for the United States
and said Saudi Arabia had displaced Mexico, Canada and Venezuela as
the United States' No. 1 oil supplier.
   It said production by the 13-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries surpassed 20 billion barrels per day in August
and September and blamed aggressive competition between OPEC
members for forcing the average price of Mexican crude on spot
markets to about $9 a barrel.
   The monopoly said as a result of the changing marketplace for
crude that it will earn less this year than the $7.9 billion
generated by oil exports in 1987.
   But Pemex said Friday that it will not increase its exports to
compensate for lost earnings and risk aggravating an already
volatile market.
   ``Mexico is ready to (hold a) dialogue both with OPEC members as
well as independent exporters with the objective of achieving
reasonable and stable prices for petroleum,'' the statement said.
   The Excelsior news service on Thursday quoted an official with
the Energy, Mines and State-Owned Industries Department as saying
Mexico had lost $2 billion in anticipated revenues so far in 1988
because of depressed market prices. The department oversees Pemex's
operations.
   Foreign exchange revenues generated by oil exports are essential
to Mexico's efforts to service its $104 billion foreign debt,
second largest in the developing world behind Brazil.
   Mexico is the world's sixth-largest oil producer.

   A papyrus boat paddled by a six-member
Greek crew set out Saturday from this Aegean port to recreate a
10,000-year-old voyage to the island of Melos.
   A black-robed bishop chanted a 20-minute blessing and a band
played music to begin the archaeological experiment to determine
how Stone Age seafarers would have made the 94-mile trip.
   Several thousand people applauded as the 21-foot open boat,
named Papyrela for the Greek word for papyrus and made of yellow
papyrus stems lashed together with rope, slipped away from the
dockside at sunset.
   The island-hopping voyage to Melos will take eight or nine days
if the weather is favorable, said Elias Mamounas, captain of the
Papyrela.
   A Greek Navy vessel and a yacht will escort the boat, said Haris
Tzalas, head of the Hellenic Institute for the Preservation of
Nautical Tradition, which organized the project.
   The earliest known Mediterranean seafarers went to Melos to
obtain supplies of obsidian, a volcanic glass prized in ancient
times as a razor-sharp cutting tool.
   American archaeologists found obsidian blades during excavations
in the 1970s at the Franchthi Cave in southern Greece. They
belonged to Mesolithic cave dwellers and were dated to around 8,000
B.C.
   Boats made of papyrus, a kind of reed, also were used in ancient
Egypt from about 5,000 B.C. The Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl,
sailed from Egypt across the Atlantic in a papyrus boat, the Ra-I.

conclusion that she made the whole thing up.
   ``This is no hoax. It's the ugly truth that some don't want to
deal with, but I have to live with it,'' Tawana Brawley, 16, said
during a news conference.
   A dazed Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28 in a garbage bag outside
an apartment her family had recently vacated in Wappingers Falls,
75 miles north of New York City. Her body was smeared with dog
feces and marked with racial epithets.
   She said she had been held captive for four days and raped by
several white men, including one who carried a police-type badge.
She implicated several law enforcement officials in the attack.
   Miss Brawley and her mother refused to cooperate with the
investigation on the recommendation of their advisers, who had
accused authorities of a racially motivated cover-up.
   Miss Brawley appeared at Saturday's news conference with her
mother Glenda Brawley; her advisers, the Rev. Al Sharpton, C.
Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr.
   ``I have a story to tell and evidence to back it up,'' Miss
Brawley said. ``I am a good student, but I am not smart enough to
fool doctors.
   ``I have suffered greatly in these last few months. This report
confirms my worst suspicions,'' she said.
   As in past appearances, Sharpton, Mason and Maddox did not allow
Miss Brawley to answer questions from reporters.
   On Thursday, a grand jury issued its report, which was based on
a seven-month investigation of the teen-ager's story.
   The panel said it found no evidence that Miss Brawley had been
sexually assaulted, and said the teen-ager herself was responsible
for the condition in which she was found after a four-day
disappearance last November.
   Miss Brawley, her mother and their advisers were in Chicago to
attend a convention of the Nation of Islam, headed by Louis
Farrakhan.
   Farrakhan has supported Brawley throughout the ordeal and
Sharpton called him the ``only credible national leader left in
black America.''

   Pope John Paul II on Saturday urged
Europe to build a future based on the foundation of dignity,
freedom and rights that transcend national boundaries.
   John Paul, making his fourth trip to France and his 40th foreign
trip as pope, spoke to the Council of Europe and the European Court
of Human Rights on the first day of his four-day visit to
Alsace-Lorraine, in eastern France.
   In an airport arrival statement, the pontiff, speaking in
French, said the Roman Catholic Church views ``with satisfaction
the efforts made by the European countries to tighten still more
their bonds and forge a common future.''
   In the past, the Polish-born pontiff has evoked the vision of a
united Europe ``from the Atlantic to the Urals,'' based on a common
Christian heritage.
   The pope expanded on this theme later Saturday and was expected
to do so again when he speaks to the European Parliament on Tuesday.
   His message comes at a time of lively debate among the Common
Market nations, which have agreed to fully integrate their
economies in 1992. The commitment has touched off widespread
discussion about whether Western Europe should become a single
political unit.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain provoked protests
last month when she declared a U.S.-style European union would be
``highly damaging'' to the individual states.
   Speaking to the Council of Europe, the pope said the countries
of the old continent should remember their common Christian
heritage and apply it in policies governing family life,
biotechnology, education and employment.
   ``The most urgent problem on which all nations should cooperate
is access to work,'' he said.
   ``Is it utopian to ask that when decisions of an economic nature
are made, there should be consideration of the trials of those who
lose through unemployment a part of their dignity and sometimes
even their strength to hope?''
   Mrs. Thatcher has called on her fellow leaders to concentrate on
lowering commercial barriers and other practical steps, setting
aside projects for Europe-wide social progress she described in a
recent speech as utopian.
   In a wood-paneled room of the Palace of Europe, the 68-year-old
pope said that if Europe ``wishes to be true to itself, it must
gather together all the forces of the continent, respecting the
character of each region, but finding its roots in a common
spirit.''
   In the more intimate chamber at the European Court of Human
Rights, the pope referred to human rights as ``not just a catalogue
of positive rights, but a body of underlying values'' that are
``the expression of the inalienable dignity of the human person.''
   In the late afternoon, John Paul said Mass at Strasbourg
Cathedral, arriving in the open popemobile despite the cool weather
and periodic drizzle. In the evening, the pope spoke in French and
German to a rally of 36,000 youngsters at the La Meinau Stadium in
a Strasbourg suburb. He spoke of understanding some of the issues
facing youth today, including unemployment, sex and education.
   ``I respect your suffering. I am open to the questions it brings
you up against. ... No doubt there are even greater, more
widespread evils. The poor countries would tell you so,'' he said.
   The pope's visit was timed for his participation in the 2,000th
anniversary of Strasbourg. He also has scheduled visits to the
dioceses of Strasbourg, Metz and Nancy, all in the northeast near
West Germany.
   The Council of Europe is composed of 21 parliamentary
democracies that make up nearly all of non-communist Europe. It
aims to coordinate European legislation through a series of accords
and to encourage unity, democracy and human rights.
   The Court of Human Rights has unusual power for an international
judicial body, with the right to assign damages to the losing party
in a case or to expel a country from the Council of Europe.
   It has condemned Britain for its methods of interrogating
terrorism subjects in Northern Ireland and ruled in favor of two
sets of British parents in a case that resulted in the abolition of
corporal punishment in English state schools.
   Unlike the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and its
judicial organs are not related to the European Economic Community,
or Common Market.

<HEAD>Columbia Snaps Longest Losing Streak in College Football</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY24</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia University snapped college football's
longest losing streak of 44 games over nearly five years on
Saturday by defeating Ivy League rival Princeton 16-13.
   Solomon Johnson's 2-yard scoring run with about five minutes
left to play capped a 53-yard drive and followed a field goal that
had given Princeton a 13-9 lead.
   Columbia's Greg Abbruzzese rushed for 182 yards as the Lions won
for the first time in 47 games. The last time the Lions won was a
21-18 defeat of Yale on Oct. 15, 1983. Since that game, Columbia
had averted defeat only by tying Bucknell and Dartmouth later in
1983.
   Columbia fans tore down both goal posts, smeared themselves with
mud and exulted in the cold and damp.
   ``Wonderful,'' said Lenny Rehner, clutching his wet thermal
mittens. ``It's wonderful. ``We've been waiting a long time.''
   ``I'm feeling a little faint,'' agreed Charles Fornara, a 1986
graduate who had never seen his team win.
   The anarchic Columbia marching band joined the pileup on the
field, complete with sousaphone, trumpets, flutes and drums. Band
members massed outside the stadium later, chanting against
Princeton and dangling from the open jaws of Columbia's bronze lion
statue.
   The victory came on Columbia's Homecoming Day, when stars of
Columbia's nationally ranked teams of the late 1940s were present
to watch.
   ``They've got the monkey off their backs now,'' said Joe Karas,
a 1949 graduate who played guard.
   ``It's like you're thirsty for a long time and all of a sudden
you get something to drink. We've been out in the desert,'' said
Don Kasprzak, a 1947 graduate who played quarterback.
   John Sharkey, a senior tackle on this year's team, said he
watched in disbelief from the sidelines as Princeton's last-second,
49-yard field goal attempt fell short and wide.
   ``It's hard to believe that we actually achieved what we set out
to do,'' Sharkey said. ``This almost makes up for all the rough
times.''

   Crying children and bewildered neighbors
stared at chalk outlines, debris and a dangling utility pole
Saturday at the spot where five girls were killed when a speeding
car jumped a sidewalk and struck them.
   The teen-age driver has diabetes, and authorities were checking
reports that he may have suffered a seizure before the accident
Friday night, said police Chief Reed Woodward. He said no alcohol
was involved. Witnesses said the car was traveling at up to 70 mph.
   The driver and his sister, who was a passenger, were in critical
condition Saturday at two Green Bay hospitals. Pulaski, a village
with about 1,875 residents, is about 15 miles northwest of Green
Bay in northeast Wisconsin.
   ``It's going to tear us apart. Everybody's just devastated. We
knew these little girls,'' said Gina Wood, 43, who used to babysit
one of the victims.
   Witnesses told authorities the car sheared off the bottom of a
utility pole, plowed into the five girls on a sidewalk and struck a
tree. The police chief said evidence indicates the car was out of
control for about 1,500 feet.
   ``This must have happened just incredibly fast for these kids
not to get out of the way,'' Woodward said.
   He identified the victims as 13-year-olds Brenda Hylok, Laura
Karcz, Jessica McKeefry and Jodi Prokop, and Nicole Watia, 12.
   The driver, Scott C. Karcz, 17, is a distant relative of one of
the victims, Woodward said.
   The dead girls were seventh- and eighth-graders at Glenbrook
Elementary School. School officials are planning a memorial service
at Pulaski High School on Tuesday, and funerals were scheduled for
Wednesday.
   Counselors and ministers have been working to help children and
friends of the victims deal with their grief.

   Two inches of snow fell near Mount Snow, Vt., and in the higher
elevations of New England Saturday, and thunder showers pelted the
central portion of the United States.
   Rain also fell in much of New England and parts of southeast New
York.
   Scattered showers and thunder storms hit south of Lake Erie and
Lake Ontario. Much of Kansas, Oklahoma and north central and
northeast Texas were covered by low clouds, fog and rain. Thunder
storms also were reported in north central Texas.
   Foggy skies shrouded the north Pacific Coast, with fair weather
prevailing over the rest of the country.
   Temperatures early Saturday were in the 30s over northeast
portions of New England. Readings were in the 40s in the northern

<TEXT>
   Premier Branko Mikulic of Yugoslavia
on Saturday said the government would allow the emergency
importation of $200 million worth of food staples and other
consumer goods.
   The $200 million will be used primarily to import meat, cooking
oil, sugar and corn, whose prices have soared in recent weeks
because of drought and inflation, Mikulic said in a nationally
televised speech.
   Mikulic announced unspecified steps would be taken to protect
declining standards of living and to motivate workers to work
harder. But he also said he intended to continue with the basic
tenets of his austerity program despite widespread protests in
Montenegro republic.
   By allowing these imports, Mikulic said he hoped to dampen
inflationary pressure and demonstrate his determination to ease the
nation's economic crisis.
   The announcment came while a joint session of the state
presidency and Communist Party presidium of Montenegro republic
convened in Titograd to discuss the mass demonstrations that flared
anew this week.
   Police used clubs and tear gas Saturday to break up rallies in
Titograd and Niksic by thousands of demonstrators demanding the
ouster of Communist leaders. At least 23 people were detained and
10 injured in the incidents.
   Yugoslavia has a $21 billion foreign debt and an inflation rate
that is averaging 217 percent over the last 12 months, up from 170
percent in 1987.

   Brandeis University opened its doors 40
years ago this month with 107 students, and despite its tender age,
the private four-year college today has 3,000 students who appear
to believe youth is an asset.
   ``We have a lot more freedom in terms of policies because it
doesn't have a long tradition it's locked into,'' said senior Joel
Pomerantz, 20, of Denver, who is student Senate president.
   ``Its youth gives it an air of progressiveness. People recognize
it's a place to really explore what you believe in,'' said
Pomerantz.
   The Jewish founders of Brandeis wanted to create a nonsectarian
school in the tradition of such universities as Harvard and Notre
Dame, whose origins were religious but whose mission was quality
education.
   It was established at a time when some universities limited
enrollment of Jews and other minorities.
   ``In 1948 a lot of top universities still had quota systems for
Jews and Catholics, and blacks were hardly an issue then,'' said
David Merkowitz, spokesman for the Washington-based American
Council on Education.
   ``You don't have the same kinds of needs'' for unbiased
admission, Merkowitz said. ``But the availability of institutions
like that is important in educational diversity.''
   Today, the student body is estimated to be about 65 percent
Jewish. Thirteen percent are black, Hispanic and Asian.
   ``A place of excellence, that's why Brandeis was founded. There
were quotas against Jews, but there was a need beyond that,'' said
Brandeis President Evelyn Handler.
   Brandeis was a maverick from the start. Only two of its seven
founding trustees had been to college. The school lacked a single
large endowment but instead built itself on many small donations.
   The university is among the most expensive private colleges at
$20,000 for tuition, room and board.
   The school was named for the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Louis D. Brandeis. A liberal jurist and the first Jew on the high
court when he was appointed in 1916, he died in 1941.
   The small liberal arts university on the grounds of a defunct
medical school 10 miles west of Boston soon attracted to its
faculty such luminaries as Leonard Bernstein and Eleanor Roosevelt.
It began turning out such graduates as the future Rep. Stephen
Solarz, D-NY, Angela Davis and Marshal Herskovitz, the producer of
the award-winning TV show, ``thirtysomething.''
   ``There was a cerain audacity to the whole thing,'' said
Professor Lawrence Fuchs, who teaches American civilization and
politics and has been at Brandeis since 1952, serving in a variety
of administrative posts.
   ``It had such phenomenal, mercurial success. No institution
assembled a faculty of national and international standing so
quickly,'' Fuchs said.
   The question of Brandeis' Jewish identity remains an unsettled
one, however.
   When a student newspaper three years ago praised the Palestine
Liberation Organization and criticized Israel, other students
stormed its offices and labeled its staff _ one-third Jewish _
anti-Semitic.
   Just this past April, Jewish students who observe religious
dietary laws protested when the student cafeteria began serving
pork and shellfish.
   A counterprotest by students accused the protesters of hostility
toward non-Jews on the campus.

   Frank W. Emig, director of the AFL-CIO's
department of community services since 1985, died here Saturday
from cancer. He was 62.
   Emig for 20 years had headed the labor federation's efforts to
stop the spread of state right-to-work laws that forbid unions from
collecting dues from non-members that they represent in collective
bargaining contracts.
   Twenty-one states have such laws now, but only one, Louisiana,
adopted the statute between 1965 and 1985 when Emig headed the
federation's program.
   As director of community services for the AFL-CIO, Emig headed a
network of representatives in 188 cities in 37 states responsible
for coordinating blood drives, food banks and other charities,
according to Rex Hardesty, a federation spokesman.
   Emig's survivors include his widow, Rose. Plans for funeral
services were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito was given another blood
transfusion Saturday, as his son, Crown Prince Akihito, expressed
concern over the number of events canceled out of respect for the
ill monarch.
   For the second day, Hirohito showed no outward signs of the
hemorrhaging that caused him to vomit blood 20 days ago, imperial
officials said. But doctors said the 87-year-old emperor received
another transfusion because they believe the bleeding has not
stopped.
   Hirohito, the world's oldest living monarch, now has received a
total of 13 pints of blood since his condition worsened.
   Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda quoted doctors
as saying a new antibiotic apparently has helped reduce the
emperor's slight fever, which they believe is caused by an
inflammation of his bile duct.
   Maeda said the emperor's condition was stable and his jaundice
``had not progressed rapidly.''
   News reports have said Hirohito has cancer, but palace officials
have neither confirmed nor denied the reports.
   In separate meetings with Imperial Household Agency Grand
Steward Shoichi Fujimori and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita,
Akihito, heir to the throne, said his father would be displeased
about the scores of events being canceled in deference to his
illness, officials said.
   ``We appreciate the people's warm consideration very much, but
if it affects their daily lives, I'm afraid it would not make the
emperor happy,'' Akihito was quoted as telling Fujimori.
   Events, including sports festivals, concerts, overseas trips by
government officials and visits by foreign dignitaries, have been
canceled since the emperor fell ill.
   The emperor was considered a living god until he renounced his
divinity after World War II. Under Japan's postwar constitution he
became a symbol of the state with no real political power.

   The space shuttle Discovery arrived
home atop a jumbo jet Saturday, five days after completing
America's first manned space mission since the Challenger tragedy.
   A Boeing 747, with the shuttle bolted on its back, descended
through a cloud deck and glided to a runway touchdown at 7:04 p.m.
EDT as darkness descended on the Kennedy Space Center. The return
flight began Saturday morning at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Because the Kennedy runway is not heavily lighted and because of
cloudy weather, NASA officials were considering diverting the
shuttle aircraft to Eglin Air Force Base in Northwest Florida for
an overnight stay.
   But half an hour before landing an advance plane reported
conditions favorable, and the jumbo jet came on in.
   Thousands of spectators turned out to applaud the return, lining
roads and river banks and creating huge traffic jams at the space
center. Most of them were among the hundreds of thousands who were
here to cheer Discovery's departure on Sept. 29.
   Technicians planned to remove the shuttle from its carrier plane
overnight and tomorrow, and then tow it to a processing facility to
prepare it for its next flight. Officials reported it returned from
space in such good shape that little refurbishment work will be
needed.
   The shuttle-jet combination made the three-hour run after a
refueling stop at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Tex.
   NASA's modified Boeing 747 took off from Edwards Air Force Base
in California's Mojave Desert military base at 10:54 a.m. EDT with
the shuttle bolted to its back, said Nancy Lovato, spokeswoman for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``It was a fitting finish to a super mission,'' Ms. Lovato said.
``It was the prettiest take-off from (Edwards) that I've ever seen.
And I've seen them all. It was as graceful as the landing.''
   The flight from Edwards to San Antonio was uneventful, said Joe
Algranti, pilot of 747.
   ``We had real good weather all the way, with a little bit of
tail wind,'' he said. ``We are glad to be back in business.''
   Discovery and its five-man crew landed on the hard clay Rogers
Dry Lake bed at Edwards last Monday, four days after its launch
from Cape Canaveral, Fla. More than 400,000 people came to cheer
the returning astronauts.
   It was the first shuttle flight since Challenger blew up during
liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven crew members.
   The highlight of Discovery's flight was the successful
deployment of a $100 million Tracking and Data Relay communications
satellite, a twin of a satellite destroyed aboard Challenger.
   The next shuttle mission will be flown by Atlantis, which will
carry a classified Defense Department payload when it is launched
in late November.
   Discovery's next flight, scheduled for Feb. 18, will deploy
another TDRS satellite for NASA communications.
   When Discovery landed in California, reporters asked Richard
Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, if the
shuttle and its jet carrier could take a more circuitous route to
Florida so it could be seen by more Americans.
   ``I wish we could fly it around, but that's not its purpose,''
Truly replied. ``It's purpose is to get back to the cape and to get
back into space where it belongs.''
   Discovery was prepared for its return to Florida by NASA
technicians who photographed and replaced damaged heat-shield
tiles, purged fuel from its main engines and orbital maneuvering
engines, installed a tailcone and locks to prevent control surfaces
from fluttering during the flight, then hoisted it atop the 747.
   NASA bought the 225-foot-long jumbo jet from American Airlines
for $15 million in 1974 and at first used it for flight research
projects. Boeing modified the jet for NASA in 1976 so it could
carry the shuttles.
   The 747 was reinforced and its engines were upgraded to increase
takeoff thrust.
   NASA recently purchased a second 747 to ferry shuttles
cross-country. Once it is modified, the second jet will be based in
El Paso, Texas.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was quoted as
saying Saturday his policy in handling the Palestinian uprising in
Israeli-occupied lands was to cause casualties among Arab rioters.
   Rabin's statement came as parts of the occupied West Bank were
paralyzed by a strike to protest the shooting deaths of four
Palestinians by Israeli troops. Arab and hospital reports said two
more Palestinians died Saturday after clashes with soldiers.
   ``In confrontation, the rioters should suffer casualties and
scars, so that they know it would not end with detentions. This is
my policy and I'm responsible for it,'' Israel radio quoted Rabin
as saying.
   Dozens of black mourning flags flew from rooftops in curfewed
Nablus, the West Bank's largest Arab city, where the four were shot
Friday.
   Clashes flared Saturday in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
Arab reports said troops shot and killed one Palestinian and
wounded 18 others. Israel television quoted Arab sources as saying
as many as 30 Palestinians were wounded.
   The army command confirmed the 18 casualties but said the death
was caused by a local feud.
   In Nablus' Ittihad Hospital, 23-year-old Hamad Abdel Kader from
the nearby El Ein refugee camp died Saturday of a head wound
suffered during a Sept. 26 demonstration, officials said.
   Kader's funeral procession sparked a riot in the curfewed camp,
and Israeli troops opened fire on mourners who unfurled outlawed
Palestinian flags, wounding seven people, an Arab reporter in
Nablus said.
   The army command confirmed the casulaties.
   The army imposed a curfew on about 120,000 Palestinians in
Nablus and the neighboring refugee camps after violent clashes
Friday. In those incidents, Arab reports said four Arabs were
killed and 21 wounded, but the army Saturday confirmed only two
deaths and 14 wounded.
   ``We know that other people have perished, but we don't know the
circumstances,'' a military spokesman said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Nablus' streets were deserted except for army patrols. At one
point, demonstrators violated the curfew and threw stones at
soldiers, an Arab reporter said. The army said three Palestinians
were wounded in the clash.
   Around the West Bank towns of Qalqilya, Tulkarem and Jenin,
Palestinians staged a strike in solidarity with Nablus residents.
   Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at the troops, who in
response shot and wounded four people, the military command said.
   In the West Bank village of Yabad near Tulkarem, Ahmad Zeid
Kelani, 28, died after being shot in the chest Saturday, hospital
officials said.
   Circumstances of the death were not immediately clear. The army
said it was apparently caused by a feud between villagers, but Arab
reports said soldiers shot Kelani.
   Israel radio said several shots were fired during a fistfight
between rival families but said an army patrol was attacked when it
entered the village to separate the foes.
   Saturday's fatalities raised to 291 the number of Palestinians
killed since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation
began Dec. 8. Six Israelis have died in clashes during the same
period.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army clamped a curfew on five
towns and refugee camps, affecting at least 100,000 people.
   In Gaza Strip clashes, four Palestinians were wounded, the army
said.
   The radio quoted Rabin as saying 7,000 Palestinians have been
wounded and 18,000 detained since the uprising began. Of them, some
5,600 are still in jail, with about 2,000 serving sentences of up
to six months without trial.
   In spite of the high number of casualties and detentions, Rabin
was quoted as saying, the army still failed to achieve its goal of
``restoring quiet and maintaining Israeli control'' in the occupied
territories.
   The radio was banned from broadcasting Rabin's voice following a
law forbidding it to air voices of candidates competing in the Nov.
1 parliamentary elections. Rabin runs for the left-leaning Labor
Party.
   Also Saturday, authorities detained five ultra-Orthodox Jews
during a religious riot during which stones were thrown at passing
cars and police in a Jerusalem neighborhood, Israel radio said.
   They were protesting what they view as violations of the Jewish
Sabbath, the biblically mandated day of rest which lasts from
sundown Friday till sundown Saturday. Jewish law forbids any work,
including driving, on Sabbath.

   Tennessee's oldest town was alive
Saturday with tales of monkey kings and devil imps at a 16-year-old
storytelling festival that has helped revive national interest in
the ancient folk art.
   Tellers from California to New York entertained about 5,000
people under large, striped tents set up on hillsides, along a
creek and near railroad tracks downtown.
   ``Aaaaargh'' screeched Brenda Wong Aoki as she became an angry
monkey king. The monkey was pulled down to the underworld but saved
from death in ``the great wok'' by eating forbidden peaches that
made him immortal.
   The San Francisco teller of tales from the Orient was among 15
featured yarn-spinners, including folk singer Pete Seeger. Seeger,
who lives in Beacon, N.Y., picked a handmade, 35-year-old banjo as
he sang of a coal miner's rebellion and the plight of American
Indians.
   ``This festival is redefining storytelling and bringing it back
to life,'' Seeger said. ``I'm just an amateur. I'm having a
wonderful time listening to these expert storytellers.''
   The three-day National Storytelling Festival is sponsored each
year by a Jonesborough group with a mouthful of a name _ the
National Association for the Preservation and Perpetuation of
Storytelling.
   The festival is bigger every year and a sixth tent was added
this year to accommodate crowds that spilled under rolled-up tent
flaps into the sun.
   Jackie Torrence, from Granite Quarry, N.C., had children in
stitches when she added her own brand of humor to the classic tale
of the selling of a soul to the devil.
   Jack, a not-so-bright poor man with only a skinny cow to sell,
runs into the devil dressed in black and sitting on a rock. He
sells the cow to the devil for a bottomless purse of gold, but he
pays later when he dies and is put in charge of the devil's 100
million caged imps.
   Amateur tellers tried their luck in the center of a small circle
of hay bales called ``The Swappin' Ground.'' Among those who got up
to tell was 9-year-old Luke Shaefer of Dexter, Mich., who spun one
about a dragon.
   ``I've got to make it a little bit slower,'' he said after he
was done. ``It's fun. I like telling stories. It's my way of having
fun.''
   Jym Kruse, 40, of Fremont, Neb., said he traveled to
Jonesborough for his second year of tip-gathering among the
masters. Kruse is a college professor, campus pastor and
storyteller in a state with no such festival, although similar
events are cropping up across the country.
   ``I come to see master tellers demonstrate how you do it well,''
he said. ``I always find new inspiration. They serve as mentors
rather than sources of information for stories.''

   A retired airline pilot was killed
Saturday when the vintage combat plane he was flying crashed
minutes after making a pass before an air show crowd of 20,000,
officials said.
   No other injuries were reported.
   Authorities said Max Gardner, of Fort Worth, whose age was
unavailable, was killed when the twin-engine Douglass A-20 Havack
Attack Bomber, believed to be the last of its kind, crashed about
2:45 p.m. in a cornfield about five miles south of Harlingen.
   Few people saw the crash because Gardner had already flown past
the crowd at the Valley International Airport and was about three
miles away, said Herschel Whittington of the Confederate Air Force,
an international group of pilots and air-show buffs who owned the
craft.
   The Havack Attack bomber was a fairly small workhorse used by
American, Australian and British forces during the early stages of
World War II, Whittington said.
   Harlingen police dispatcher Gale Jones said witnesses reported
seeing the plane ``flip over, do a nose dive, then hit the ground.''
   Jones also said witnesses told police the plane lost power in
one engine before crashing.

   A man was sentenced to three years
in prison after causing ``serious health damage'' for knowingly
spreading the AIDS virus, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The unnamed defendant, suspecting venereal disease, tested
positive for AIDS when he sought medical help two years ago, the
Lidova Demokracie (People's Democracy) newspaper reported. The man
was instructed to limit his sexual contact to one partner and to
use a condom.
   ``Several dozen witnesses, two of whom carry the virus,
testified in the case,'' said the Roman Catholic daily, which is
sanctioned by the communist government.
   The paper said it was the first such case of its type in
Czechoslovakia. The verdict is subject to an appeal.
   A positive test indicates presence of AIDS antibodies but does
not mean the person has the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
The immune-stripping virus can be spread through sexual contact.
   Czechoslovakia has 100 registered AIDS virus carriers, the state
news agency CTK reported last month.

   Learning on the job once meant learning
how to do the work, but some Kentucky companies are changing the
rules to give themselves an edge and their employees an education.
   There are about 400,000 illiterate adults in Kentucky, and
approximately 650,000 adults without a high school diploma, said
Pat Gleich, director of the Kentucky Literacy Commission in
Frankfort.
   Some state employers have found that the lack of education among
their workers is a drag on productivity.
   ``We had a lot of people out there that didn't finish high
school,'' said Earle Johnson, personnel administrator at the Texas
Instruments plant in Versailles. ``You're demanding more from your
people. They couldn't cope with it. They couldn't handle it.''
   Texas Instruments tested the 800 people at the plant two years
ago, Johnson said, and found 200 didn't have a high school
education. Of those, six could not read or write.
   Johnson arranged for an instructor to use a classroom in the
plant to teach classes for General Educational Development diplomas.
   The state paid for the instructor, Johnson said, while the
company provided some materials and the classroom. Students paid
the $15 class fee. At first, classes were just for employees, but
now they are open to the public.
   ``What we've found is, we end up with a person who has a much
higher self-esteem ... and they become a better employee because
they're willing to speak out better than they were before. ... It's
done a lot for the confidence of the people.
   ``It's for the individual themselves, basically. ... But we get
a benefit from it. We're not that holy. I didn't think it would
make a difference, but it does. It makes a big difference.''
   Johnson's program was a model for a similar one at Fuller
Precision Manufacturing Co. in Falmouth.
   ``I'm excited to no end'' about job-site education, Fuller
president Howard Deem said during a recent interview.
   With help from April Roberts of the Pendleton County Adult
Education Program and a literacy volunteer, Fuller offered GED and
literacy classes at the plant this year.
   Of 158 employees, about 30 signed up for both classes, Ms.
Roberts said, and 11 have so far received their GEDs.
   Deem said Fuller paid for all materials, class and test fees,
which totaled about $4,000. He also said the employees who got
their GEDs would receive a pay increase.
   Jerry Spegal, a high school dropout and assistant foreman at the
plant, said he would have taken the course without a bonus
incentive.
   ``I would say that ... when we first started going there was no
talk of a bonus, so I guess we all would've,'' Spegal said.
   Deem said the difference was phenomenal.
   ``The return on the investment has been one of the best things
I've ever done in my life,'' he said. ``We would have had to demote
these people back to janitorial services because of the quality
program we're putting in. ... How can we further the (job)
education unless they can read and write and do some basic math?''
   Even those who haven't yet graduated ``are moving up so much in
the plant, they're making money for us,'' Deem said.
   Spegal, 29, said he is thinking about attending Northern
Kentucky University.
   ``I'm not really sure ... how far I want to go. But I've got the
rest of my life to do it.''

<TEXT>
   Despite the anti-tax rhetoric of the
presidential candidates, the nation's business leaders seem
prepared to accept a tax increase as part of a plan to shrink the
budget deficit.
   Republican George Bush has flatly promised never to raise taxes,
while Democrat Michael Dukakis has said he would turn to taxes only
as a last resort.
   But some of the executives of the country's largest companies,
attending a meeting of the Business Council on Saturday, said they
were willing to back off from their traditional opposition to tax
increases.
   ``In our private conversations, I find in general people say,
`I'd be willing to come up with some reasonable approach to
additional taxes, maybe dollar for dollar with real savings (in
deficit reduction),''' said George M. Keller, chairman of Chevron
Corp.
   The council finished its twice-a-year, two-day conference at
this resort town in the mountains of western Virginia by hearing
from former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis and former
Democratic National Chairman Robert S. Strauss.
   The two are co-chairmen of a high-level government commission
scheduled in December to deliver a deficit-cutting plan to Congress
and the next president.
   ``I think the business community is very concerned about the
deficit. I further think they're satisfied there should be a
spending cut and@or a tax increase or some combination of both _ so
long as it doesn't affect their business,'' said Lewis, who as
chairman of Union Pacific Corp. is also a member of the council.
   He said his commission's job is ``20 percent economics and 80
percent ... trying to establish a willingness ... to share the
misery.''
   Council sessions are closed to non-members, but executives and
speakers talked with reporters afterward.
   Most of the business leaders prefer a tax increase, if there is
one, aimed at curbing consumption and encouraging saving rather
than a tax on business.
   ``Taxes that slow up the economy and reduce our ability to
compete are bad for the long-term interests of the country,'' said
Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman of Pfizer Corp., a health care
company.
   John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank,
argued that a tax on consumption would benefit consumers.
   ``If we do the right job with the fiscal deficit, we'll get the
payback in a relaxation on the monetary side so that you could see
a significant reduction in interest rates,'' he said.
   A dissenting view was offered by Walter Wriston, Reed's
predecessor at Citicorp. In the text of a speech to the council, he
argued that the deficit was inflated by outdated government
accounting procedures that treat long-range capital spending the
same as operating expenses and by the failure to take state
government surpluses into account. He said the U.S. deficit was not
severe compared with other Western nations and had not caused the
economic ills for which it is blamed.
   Although Lewis stressed that the commission had made no
decisions yet, he said any tax increase likely would have to be
coupled with an assurance that the money would be used to reduce
the deficit. He said any consumption tax would clearly have to have
a provision to exempt poor people.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said the next president will have a difficult time
convincing the public that it is necessary to reduce the deficit
because neither presidential candidate is addressing the issue in
the campaign.
   ``The next president is going to need a lot of help. ...
Business leaders have to be at the forefront of trying to help
him,'' he said.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House Budget Committee
and a member of the Strauss-Lewis commission, was particularly
critical of Bush for boxing himself in politically with the no-tax
pledge. He also said Bush's plan for a flexible spending freeze was
``fiscal frozen fruitcake.''

   Opposition plans to create a ``grand
coalition government'' next year face a strong challenge from the
left and from pro-government forces claiming a hidden victory in
President Augusto Pinochet's defeat.
   ``It's going to be very, very hard,'' Arturo Valenzuela,
director of Latin American studies at Georgetown University in
Washington, said in an interview Saturday.
   The coalition must realize that next year's open election ``is
not in the bag,'' said Valenzuela, a Chilean who came home to
monitor last week's vote on Pinochet.
   He said the coalition of 16 opposition parties from the
center-right to Socialist left that campaigned for Pinochet's
defeat must avoid overconfidence.
   Pinochet lost by more than 800,000 votes in Wednesday's
yes-or-no referendum on whether to extend his 15-year rule to 1997.
   According to the 1980 constitution, he remains president for 16
more months. The winner of elections planned for December 1989 is
to assume power in March 1990.
   The opposition coalition's secretary-general, Genaro Arrigada,
said he is not worried that the opposition will fall apart, despite
the country's tradition for splitting into what Chileans call ``the
three thirds:'' right, center and left. Most previous presidential
elections had three major candidates, one from each camp.
   ``If we are going to have three thirds, it's not important if
there is respect and understanding,'' he said.
   But he said the coalition plans to pursue ``a grand coalition
government'' after pressing for constitutional changes to speed the
election and Pinochet's departure from power.
   ``There's a chore for each day,'' he said. ``Right now, what we
have to do is change the constitution with the armed forces.''
   Pinochet, 72, who seized power in a 1973 coup, has vowed to
remain in office until his term runs out. The powerful army he
commands has shown no willingness to bargain with politicians.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian Democratic
Party, and Ricardo Lagos, a prominent moderate Socialist, recognize
that any negotiations with the military could take time.
   ``The people are mature enough to understand that 15 years of
dictatorship don't end in 15 hours,'' Lagos said. ``If we remain
united, Pinochet can do nothing. That's the only important thing
right now.
   ``Consensus will be relatively easy,'' he said. ``There aren't
that many leaders. It seems to me we have to find a man or woman
who represents everyone'' to run in the election.
   Most observers believe the consensus candidate will be Aylwin, a
67-year-old law professor and veteran politician generally
considered acceptable to both the moderate right and left.
   But leaders of the radical United Left alliance on Saturday
called for Pinochet's immediate resignation and were expected to
disregard moderates' appeals for patience.
   Since Wednesday's referendum, Lagos, 52, has been barraged by
supporters asking if he will run as the candidate of the left. On
Friday, he declared: ``I'm not a candidate. I'm not the most
appropriate person.''
   The government and rightist groups are clearly hoping for an
opposition split that could win them the election. Experts disagree
over whether the constitution allows Pinochet himself to be a
candidate, but his interior minister, Sergio Fernandez, said the
loss Wednesday actually represented a kind of political victory.
   Slightly more than 3.1 million people cast ``yes'' ballots
Wednesday, compared to more than 3.8 million ``no'' votes.
   Fernandez said the ``no'' votes ``have to be divided by 16,''
the number of parties in the opposition coalition, while Pinochet
alone can claim the ``yes'' votes.
   ``There is no greater political force than President Pinochet's
support,'' he said.
   ``The opposition's support could be numerically more (than the
one the government received) but it is not homogeneous,'' Fernandez
said Saturday night in a 12-minute nationwide radio-and-television
broadcast. ``We in the government are unified in all that is
essential, and it makes us stronger.''
   Conservative civilian politicians also have expressed the desire
to take the support for Pinochet and turn it into a victory for the
right in an open election.
   If more than two candidates run and neither wins more than 50
percent of the vote, the constitution calls for a runoff between
the two highest vote-getters.
   Valenzuela said he was certain that if the opposition splits and
the runoff features a rightist and a leftist candidate, the right
would win.
   He said Chileans ``would be afraid that a leftist government
would lead to another coup. And they'll choose anything before
another coup.''

   A series of earthquakes hit the
southeast edge of the Sierra Nevada on Saturday, the largest
measuring 4.1 on the Richter scale, a spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology said.
   No injuries were reported and no damage estimates were available.
   ``It shook some of the little houses a bit. But I was in this
cement building, and it didn't shake nothing in here,'' said Kevin
Lyster, a truck driver who was at the Little Lake Hotel.
   The 4.1 quake hit at 2:14 p.m. about 12 miles northeast of
Little Lake, a community near the China Lake naval weapons station,
about 125 miles north of Los Angeles, said Caltech spokesman Robert
Finn.
   That temblor was followed by ``a couple dozen'' and the most
intense of those was a 3.4-magnitude tremor at 2:26 p.m.
   Finn said the area is known for ``fairly intense swarms of
earthquakes.''
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage; a 4 causes considerable damage. An 8 is is a ``great''
quake, capable of tremendous damage.

<HEAD>Man Convicted In Attack On Three Teen Runaways</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man accused of raping, knifing and
shooting three teen-age runaways was found guilty Saturday of
murdering one of them.
   A Kitsap County Superior Court jury found Daniel J. Yates guilty
of aggravated first-degree murder and other charges in the attack
last year. The same jury now will hear more testimony before
deciding between a death sentence or life in prison without parole.
   Yates, 33, a tattoo artist from nearby Bremerton, was accused of
taking the boy and two girls he picked up Sept. 17, 1987, to an
isolated area, raping them at gunpoint, and tying them up.
   Bunnie Lynn Brown, 13, was shot in the head during the attack
and died two months later. The other girl, 15, and the boy, 13,
survived.
   Yates was also found guilty of two counts of attempted
first-degree murder and three counts of first-degree rape.
   Kris Brown, the mother of the murdered girl, smiled, cried and
hugged a supporter when the verdict was read.
   The 15-year-old girl, who survived gunshots and a slashed
throat, also was in the courtroom for the verdict.
   In closing arguments Friday, Kitsap County Prosecutor Dan Clem
pointed at Yates and said, ``The state has presented to you an
ugly, violent picture with that man at the core.''
   The isolated area where Yates took the three had ``no houses, no
lights, no traffic _ perfect place to rape and murder,'' Clem said.
   Yates raped the teens at gunpoint and tied them up, and while
binding them he had time to premeditate murder, Clem said. The
death penalty can be given only when murder is premeditated.
   Yates raped a girl, tied her up, then shot her in the eye and
ear, but she remained conscious and watched as Yates sodomized a
boy, Clem said. After the assailant left she freed herself and ran
barefoot down the gravel road to get help, the prosecutor said.
   ``Who should she run into but the defendant?'' Clem said. ``This
nightmare shouldn't happen to anybody.''
   Yates slit the girl's throat in the second encounter, but ``he's
still not done,'' Clem said. ``He strangles her, smashes her face
into the ground.'' The girl played dead to make Yates leave, he
said.
   The defense maintained that Yates attacked the children only
after one of the girls consented to have sex with him, and the
three then threatened to double-cross him for money.
   ``I am not denying to you _ Daniel Yates is not denying to you _
that he cut, choked, shot and strangled'' the teens, defense
attorney Judith Mandel told jurors. But ``there are different
versions of these events,'' she added.
   The three teens are from Bremerton, across Puget Sound from
Seattle.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Protection For Government Whistle Blowers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to provide better protection for
government employees who report waste or fraud in their agencies
won Senate approval on Saturday and was sent to President Reagan.
   Under the bill, approved earlier in the week by the House,
government whistle blowers who feel they have been unfairly treated
would be allowed to appeal their cases directly to the Merit
Systems Protection Board, an independent body set up to review
personnel actions.
   Supporters said the legislation was needed because the Office of
Special Counsel, established to represent whistle blowers, was not
doing its job.
   The bill also would make it easier for employees to prove
improper retaliation by simplifying the elements of proof and
increasing the burden on an agency to justify its actions.
   The legislation will ``send a clear signal that retaliation
against whistle-blowers will not be tolerated'' in the federal
government, said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who sponsored the bill
in the Senate.
   ``If we are going to achieve a more honest and efficient
government, it is essential that we restore confidence in federal
employees that their government will respond in a fair and ethical
manner whenever they disclose wrongdoing,'' Levin said in a
statement.
   The bill won Senate approval on a voice vote as the chamber met
past midnight early Saturday, working to complete action on
numerous bills before Congress adjourns for the national elections.
   Levin predicted Reagan would sign the bill into law.

to leave the 607-foot tower.
   No injuries were reported.
   Damages were estimated at $2,000, mostly from water damage

Seattle Fire Department officials said.
   Firefighters were hampered by the slow-moving Space Needle
elevators.
   The Space Needle was built for the 1962 World's Fair.
   The fire was in the kitchen, officials said.

   A troubled reactor at the Savannah River Plant
won't resume producing nuclear weapons material until engineers are
sure longtime safety problems have been corrected, an Energy
Department spokesman said Saturday.
   ``I think we are all disturbed by what we have seen,'' said John
Ahearne, chairman of the Advisory Committee for Nuclear Facilities
Safety, one of two Energy Department bodies investigating the
sprawling facility near Aiken, S.C.
   Richard W. Starostecki, deputy assistant energy secretary for
safety, health and quality assurance, also has started a new review
of events at the Savannah River Plant, said department spokeswoman
Chris Sankey.
   Plant managers have been rocked over the past week by disclosure
that up to 30 significant mishaps occurred at the facility over the
past three decades, and that many had not been reported to
Washington headquarters or disclosed to the public.
   All three reactors at the plant have been shut down since August
when a mishap idled the P-Reactor.
   Spokesman Doug Elmets said the department will not restart the
reactor ``until we are completely satisfied with all the safety
procedures.''
   Sankey said Friday the department had set a Nov. 1 target date
for restarting the P-Reactor, but Elmets said Saturday that Sankey
was in error and that no timetable has been set.
   The plant produces two materials used in nuclear weapons,
plutonium, which the government has in adequate supply, and
tritium, which decays more quickly. Officials say the amount of
tritium on hand and the date by which they must resume production
are classified.
   The New York Times, in its Sunday editions, said senior
administration officials believe the Savannah reactors may be out
of service so long the United States might have to start
deactivating nuclear warheads to recover radioactive elements for
use in higher priority weapons.
   It said the primary concern was the supply of tritium.
   ``It is very important that we restore the reactors to safe
operation soon,'' said Robert B. Barker, the top Pentagon official
for atomic energy matters. ``If we don't, there will be very
serious consequences for our ability to maintain our nuclear
deterrent.''
   Sankey also had said that if the Savannah River Plant cannot
resume production in time, the department might restart the
N-Reactor at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state in
order to quarantee an adequate supply of tritium.
   Elmets, however, said it would take at least 18 months to
restart the Hanford reactor. Officials are not contemplating that
option, he said.
   Concern has been mounting within the government over procedures
at the Savannah River Plant, which is operated by E.I. du Pont
Nemours & Co. under contract from the Energy Department.
   ``We have been trying to change the mind-set,'' Sankey said.
``We have been enhancing procedures as part of a long-term effort.''
   The P-Reactor was closed after a mishap caused, in part, by a
miscalculation of xenon and tritium levels and involving an
unorthodox method to manipulate control rods, according to an
internal report released Thursday.
   No date has been set for restarting the other two reactors at
Savannah River, which were shut down for long-term maintenance.
   Ahearne said his committee, which was established as an
independent board to advise Energy Secretary John Herrington, has
noticed some changes in reporting procedures at Savannah River, but
still has concerns.
   ``From what we have seen, it seems that there has grown up a
sense of complacency (at Savannah River) which is a dangerous
attitude when dealing with nuclear reactors,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   The independent committee, formed in March, began reviewing
operations at Savannah River even before four senators this week
urged an investigation, said Ahearne, a former chairman of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   ``So far, what we have is a series of serious events,'' he said.
``We are not yet prepared to conclude whether these are individual
things which need fixing or whether there is a pattern that means
something more serious needs fixing.''
   The committee will discuss its preliminary findings at an open
meeting Wednesday and Thursday in Idaho Falls, Idaho, and is due to
deliver a report to the energy secretary and Congress on Dec. 1,
said Ahearne.
   Another independent report, prepared for the Energy Department
by the NUS Corp., a private consulting firm in Aiken, cited 558
forced reactor shutdowns at Savannah River from 1971 through 1987,
of which 51 percent were caused by equipment failure, 26 percent by
personnel failure, 10 percent by ``degradation of essential
services,'' 10 percent by ``process difficulty,'' and 3 percent by
procedure deficiency.
   The report also recorded seven off-site radioactive releases
from 1975 through 1987 exceeding standards at the plant. The most
serious appeared to be the release of 600,000 gallons of
contaminated water on Oct. 25, 1977. The most recent was a tank
overflow in February 1987 in which tritium was released into the
atmosphere.

<TEXT>
   A communist rebel leader was captured
Saturday by security forces in a raid on a suburban Manila hideout,
the military's general headquarters announced.
   Military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo identified the rebel as
Luisito de la Cruz, a member of the outlawed Communist Party in
charge of operations in the central Luzon region north of Manila.
   Florendo described de la Cruz as a ``top-ranking'' regional
rebel leader who authorities had offered a $3,500 reward for his
capture.
   Florendo said de la Cruz, caught before dawn in a home in the
Manila suburb of Valenzuela, was undergoing interrogation at the
Camp Aguinaldo general headquarters. De la Cruz had been
underground for more than a decade.
   Military officials said de la Cruz joined the banned party in
1976 after helping organize the Association of Democratic Youth, a
breakaway faction of the rebel-backed Patriotic Youth, one of the
offshoots of the Communist-dominated National Democratic Front.
   The Communists have been waging a 19-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state. The Front is an umbrella organization of
12 groups believed controlled by the Communist Party of the
Philippines.
   In a related development, Maj. Gen. Mariano Adalem, commander of
the Philippine Army, said the military hoped to raise up to 1
million reservists this year to ``meet any national emergency,''
including Communist rebels and right-wing extremists.
   Adalem said the reservists would be in addition to the 80,000
men expected to join a new paramilitary group, the Citizens Armed
Force Geographical Unit, which will be deployed in rural areas by
the year's end.
   The Unit, or CAFGU, is to replace other anti-Communist vigilante
and paramilitary organizations that have been accused of widespread
human rights abuses against civilians.
   Human rights groups have already complained that the CAFGUs mark
another step in what they term the ``militarization'' of Philippine
society under President Corazon Aquino.

   Troops and police turned
out in force Saturday to ensure a demonstration marking the 20th
anniversary of a civil rights march in Northern Ireland passed
peacefully, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   No arrests or violence were reported as about 1,200 nationalist
demonstrators paraded to the center of the British province's
second largest city, said a spokesman for the RUC, Northern
Ireland's police force.
   The marchers, led by Sinn Fein political party leader Gerry
Adams, followed the route along Duke Street and Craigavon Bridge
where police and demonstrators clashed violently in 1968. Sectarian
violence since then has claimed 2,699 lives.
   Sinn Fein is the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, which is waging a violent campaign to unite the
predominately Protestant province with the mainly Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.
   Police prevented about 100 pro-British activists from holding a
counter-demonstration along the route until after the civil rights
march ended, the police spokesman said.

<HEAD>Newspaper: GAO Investigating Possible Mob Involvement in S&L
Failures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Accounting office is investigating
possible organized crime involvement in savings and loans failures
across the country, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Sources close to the GAO, the primary investigative arm of
Congress, told the Houston Post an investigation should be
completed by January. The newspaper did not identify the sources.
   The newspaper also said a congressional committee would probably
begin hearings on the matter after the report is completed.
   The GAO's investigation was prompted, in part, by newspaper
reports about reputed mob associates Herman K. Beebe Sr. and Mario
Renda and their connections to thrifts and to each other, the Post
said.
   Beebe, who is serving a one-year prison sentence for bank fraud,
had connections to 12 failed Texas savings and loans.
   Beebe is alleged to have ties to New Orleans Mafia boss Carlos
Marcello, and the Post reported ties between Beebe and Renda, a New
York money broker who allegedly is associated with the Gambino and
Lucchese crime families in New York.
   Renda, who has been convicted of bank fraud in Kansas City, Mo.,
Florida and New York, brokered deposits into at least six of the
failed Texas thrifts Beebe was connected to, including Mainland
Savings Association, the largest thrift in Houston to fail.
   Beebe helped the owners of at least four of the failed thrifts
to buy the institutions and did business with at least eight other
failed savings and loans, according to a 1985 U.S. Comptroller of
the Currency report on Beebe, lawsuits filed by the failed thrift's
federal receiver and Beebe's associates.
   Officials with the Justice Department and the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. have alleged that Beebe and Renda used
their connections to savings and loans to arrange loans for
themselves and their associates. The loans later went bad and
contributed to the failures of the thrifts, the paper said.
   Federal investigators are now trying to determine if those
connections mean that Beebe and Renda were part of a larger
consiracy by the mob to control and loot savings and loans across
the country, said officials with the Justice Department organized
crime strike forces in Texas and New York.

   Hundreds of unused medical needles
that washed ashore along Palm Beach County were made for the
Department of Defense and probably were dropped overboard by a U.S.
Navy ship, an official said.
   ``They more than likely came from one of our Atlantic fleet
units,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a spokesman at fleet
headquarters in Norfolk, Va.
   He could not say why new needles would have been dumped
overboard.
   The needles had the same lot number as more than 2,000 needles
found in September along 10 miles of Flagler County beach south of
St. Augustine, state health officials said Friday.
   The needles, found Thursday along a six-mile stretch of
oceanfront from Riviera Beach to Palm Beach, were still in their
protective plastic sheaths. No syringes were found.
   Burnett said other defense units had access to the needles from
the lot, so he could not be certain the Navy was at fault.
   The Atlantic fleet rewrote its regulations in September after
five garbage bags of medical waste traced to Navy ships washed up
on North Carolina beaches in August, Burnett said. With few
exceptions, medical waste now must be held aboard ship and disposed
of in port.

   Federal agents searched the estate of
Ferdinand Marcos' son-in-law, allegedly looking for art works and
evidence of illegal money transfers out of the Philippines,
officials confirmed.
   FBI agent Harry Mount, in Washington D.C., said Friday that
federal agents had searched the estate of Gregorio Araneta, who is
married to Marcos' daughter Irene, but he refused to provide more
information.
   ``The only thing I can tell you is we did execute a search
warrant at that address,'' Mount said.
   CBS News, citing confidential sources, reported recently that at
least three different government agencies were involved in the
search of Araneta's home and other buildings on the estate: FBI
agents looking for art, possibly stolen from the Philippines;
Internal Revenue Service agents searching for records of reputedly
illegal money transfers; and U.S. Customs agents searching for
evidence of an aborted Marcos family conspiracy to overthrow the
government of Corazon Aquino in 1987.
   Araneta, whose telephone number is unlisted, could not be
reached for comment.
   Woodside is a small community 25 miles south of San Francisco.

<TEXT>
   A group of Hollywood celebrities sought to add
star quality to the Democratic presidential campaign of Michael
Dukakis Saturday as their ``Star Spangled Caravan'' began a
barnstorming tour of the Pacific Northwest.
   ``Any bit of enthusiasm on the campaign would be to all of our
advantage,'' said Michael Gross, who portrays the affable father on
television's ``Family Ties.''
   About 35 actors appeared before about 800 students at the
University of Washington to campaign for the Democratic ticket and
to urge people to register to vote in November's general election.
   Saturday was the last day to register in Washington, and about
200 students signed up as Democrats, said Chris Crowley, press
secretary for the Dukakis campaign in the state.
   Gross drew the loudest response when he commented on Republican
Dan Quyale's vice presidential debate answer that he would first
say a prayer if thrust into the presidency.
   ``I can guarantee there would be a lot of other Americans on
their knees, people who have never cast a prayer in their lives,''
Gross said.
   The caravan, organized by California Assemblyman Tom Hayden,
husband of actress Jane Fonda, also planned stops in Portland,
Ore., and Sacramento, Calif. The three Pacific Coast states have 64
votes in the electoral college, nearly one-quarter of those needed
to elect a president, Hayden said.
   ``The stakes in this election are very huge. We're at the end of
the Reagan era, and the people in these states can pick the next
president,'' Hayden said in Los Angeles before the group departed.
``Voter registration in a close race can make an election. We hope
by the caravan, we will bring it to their attention.''
   For some on the tour, which included Bruce Willis, Rob Lowe,
Morgan Fairchild and Justine Bateman, it was a new experience.
   ``I've never been politically active before,'' said John
Larroqette of the television show ``Night Court.'' Larroqette said
he wrote in singer-singwriter David Bowie for president in the 1980
election.
   Gross defined the group with a term Republican candidate George
Bush has used to disparage Dukakis.
   ``As a group, we are probably more liberal than the national
average,'' he said amidst an autograph-seeking crowd that followed
the celebrities to voter registration tables at the campus rally.
   Lloyd Bridges, star of the 1960s television series ``Sea Hunt,''
stressed environmental issues in supporting Dukakis.
   ``I like pure clean water to dive in,'' he quipped. ``The
environment is very important, but not enough is being done about
it.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electricity customers in Chicago are paying the
highest rates in the United States this fall, a utility watchdog
group said.
   A Citizens Utility Board study concluded electric rates charged
by Commonwealth Edison Co. are increasing an average 62 percent as
rates are converted from summer to winter scales this month.
   Edison serves Chicago and much of northern Illinois.
   The increase, approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission in
June, means that a typical monthly residential bill will be $58.58,
according to the study.
   After Chicago, the next most expensive American cities for
non-summer electric rates were Philadelphia, with an average of
$52.57, New York at $49.66, San Diego at $45.39 and Phoenix at
$41.39, the study said.
   An Edison spokesman said the study results are misleading,
because a 13 percent reduction in summer rates is not considered.
   The study figures were based on an estimate of 400 kilowatt
hours per month by a single-family or two-family building that does
not have electric heat.
   ``They're not giving us credit for the rate reduction that was
in effect during the hottest summer in history. People paid
substantially less than they would have if the old rates were in
effect,'' said Edison spokesman John Hogan.
   The Illinois Commerce Commission approved the 62 percent jump in
winter rates as an emergency measure to reduce the difference
between summer and winter bills.

   Republican presidential nominee George Bush holds
a 12-point lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis among Southern
voters, according to a poll conducted by The Atlanta Journal and
The Atlanta Constitution.
   The poll of 2,102 registered voters in 15 Southern and border
states, published in the newspapers' combined Sunday editions,
showed Bush leading in every state. He held a 26-point lead in
Florida and a 14-point lead in Texas _ both considered key states
in the presidential election.
   Overall, it gave Bush a 49 percent to 37 percent lead over
Dukakis in the 15 states included in the surveyed. The poll,
conducted through random telephone interviews last week, had a
margin for error of 2 percentage points.
   According to the poll, Bush leads Dukakis among independent
voters by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, and has the support of 15 percent
of black and Hispanic voters. The poll showed women supporting Bush
over Dukakis by 46 percent to 37 percent, and men supporting Bush
by 53 percent to 37 percent.
   Twelve percent of registered voters polled said they hadn't
decided for whom they will vote. Forty percent said they have an
unfavorable opinion of Dukakis, while 29 percent said their
impression of Bush was unfavorable.
   The states in which the poll was conducted are Alabama,
Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.
