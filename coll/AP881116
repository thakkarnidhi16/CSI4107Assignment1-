   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by almost 15
percent to $10.5 billion in September, the government said
Wednesday, but not enough to prevent a new assault on the dollar
over worries about what the head of the Federal Reserve called a
``dangerous corrosion'' of the American economy.
   Exports rose by $700 million to a record high $28.2 billion, the
Commerce Department said. Imports declined by 2.5 percent or $1.1
billion to $38.7 billion from a record high in August. The $10.5
billion trade gap for September was down by $1.8 billion from the
revised August trade deficit figure of $12.3 billion, a drop of
about 14.6 percent.
   But neither change was big enough to stem a new selling wave of
dollars by traders worried about inflation from an overheating
economy and skeptical of President-elect George Bush's promise to
reduce the federal budget deficit through a ``flexible freeze''
without any tax increases.
   The dollar, resuming its downward path of last week, fell nearly
1 percent against the Japanese yen to 122.24 yen in New York trading
despite what currency traders said was intervention by the Fed to
prop it up through massive purchases of dollars using yen. The
figure was the lowest close against the yen in New York trading
since modern exchange rates were established in the late 1940s.
   In the Tokyo market Thursday morning, the dollar also fared
badly, even though one dealer said the Bank of Japan intervened to
prevent the dollar's further decline. The dollar there opened at
122.40 yen, down from Wednesday's close of 123.54 yen, and by
midmorning was trading at 121.95 yen.
   The dollar also fell 1.5 percent against the West German mark in
New York trading.
   In the past month, the dollar has fallen nearly 9 percent in
value against the yen and about 7 percent against the mark, halted
only by a brief respite Monday when Bush and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady promised that the new administration would not scrap
a two-year effort to maintain its stability.
   Stock prices, in turn, resumed their downward turn, with the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks falling 38.59 points.
   Many analysts had expected the trade deficit to drop into
``single digits'' or below $10 billion in September, like it did in
May and July.
   When it didn't, ``more general concerns'' over the federal budget
deficit and the willingness of foreigners to keep financing U.S.
consumer habits triggered the Wednesday selling spree on financial
markets, said David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data
Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   ``Exports were up, imports were down. The reaction should have
been positive,'' Wyss said. ``Although the trade deficit has
improved, the improvement seems to have stalled out at about $11
billion (deficit) a month. Add to that figures on growth that we've
seen in the past couple of weeks and the market has good reason to
be pessimistic.''
   Including the September figures, the trade deficit the first nine
months of this year is running at an annual rate of $137.2 billion,
compared with a record $170.3 billion last year and $155.1 billion
in 1986.
   The government reported earlier that the unemployment rate in
October had fallen back to 5.3 percent, matching a 14-year low, and
that retail sales in the month had shown their biggest increase in
seven months.
   The Commerce Department also reported Wednesday that plants were
running at 84 percent of their capacity, the highest rate of the
six-year economic expansion. All of those figures are viewed as
bellwethers of higher inflation.
   ``The improvement in the trade deficit was welcome, but it simply
wasn't good enough,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for The
Boston Co., a financial consulting firm.
   ``The decline in imports was only one-fourth as big as last
month's increase,'' Sinai said. ``And while exports continue at a
blistering pace ... that also suggests more inflationary pressure.''
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the National
Economic Commission on Wednesday that the budget deficit that was
largely ignored in the presidential debates ``courts a dangerous
corrosion of our economy.''
   In addition to the trade numbers, analysts said the downturn in
stock prices Wednesday can be attributed at least partially to
Greenspan's vow to tighten the money supply unless the budget
deficit is addressed ``promptly.''
   More than one-third of the September decrease in imports was
represented by smaller purchases of foreign oil and at lower prices
than in August. Imports fell 400,000 barrels a day and the average
price dropped 45 cents a barrel to $14.60, the lowest it has been in
two years.
   While there also were anticipated declines in textile, shoe,
steel and chemical imports, they were not as big as some analysts
had anticipated. And new cars coming into the American market from
abroad climbed by 8 percent to an $8 billion monthly high for the
year when they had been expected to decline.
   ``That's one of the things that worried the markets,'' Wyss said.
``It suggests we're (U.S. auto producers) are still having trouble
holding on to market share.''
   As usual, the United States suffered its biggest deficit with
Japan. At $4.1 billion, however, the gap was $700 million less than
it had been in August and was at its lowest since January. The trade
gap with Western European countries also fell by more than $500
million to $880 million in September.
   With the newly industrialized Asian countries _ Singapore, Hong
Kong, Taiwan and South Korea _ the trade gap narrowed by nearly $250
million to slightly less than $3.1 billion. But the U.S. deficit
position with Canada nearly tripled to $1.1 billion.

<HEAD>CIA Director Says Glasnost Doesn't Reduce Soviet Threat To U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA director William H. Webster said
Wednesday night that Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost has not
reduced the Soviet threat to the United States and may even increase
it.
   The Soviet Union's ``military capability, its efforts to increase
global influence and its aggressive intelligence activities are
still serious threats to United States interests,'' he said in a
speech to the Yale Political Union.
   ``Gorbachev's efforts to reform his country have not
fundamentally altered these truths,'' he said, adding they arguably
make the Soviets even a greater threat.
   ``The Soviet Union is and will continue to be the primary focus
of our intelligence collection and analysis,'' Webster said.
   After his appearance before students, Webster held a brief news
conference, which is rare for a director of central intelligence.
Asked if Soviet spying had decreased as a result of Gorbachev's
policy of openness, Webster answered ``No.'' When asked if Soviet
spying had increased, he responded, ``Possibly,'' adding there is
``very intensive intelligence work.'' He did not elaborate.
   Whatever arms control agreements the United States makes with the
Soviet Union, he said, ``I believe that our relationship is likely
to remain essentially adversarial.''
   On the matter of his own future as CIA chief under the Bush
administration, Webster said he had not yet been contacted by the
president-elect's transition team.
   He said he did not want to speculate on whether Bush would
re-appoint him or choose someone else. But he denied he had done any
lobbying for the job, saying, ``I have asked no one to advance my
interest.''
   Asked how he thought the CIA would be affected by having a
president who was a former chief of the agency, Webster said he does
not expect any significant changes although he believes Bush will
``support the work of intelligence because he understands it.''
   Webster said the president-elect had asked that he receive daily
briefings from the CIA.
   In discussing Gorbachev, Webster said he is an impressive leader
and skillful politican whose ability to get things done, in spite of
powerful opposition, should not be underestimated.
   But he said ``when we watch the leadership, we also have to see
what actual reforms are being made in terms of military activity,
aggressive intelligence against the United States, improvements in
civil rights and all the things that are important to us.
   ``Here we are still waiting for progress,'' the CIA chief said.
   ``The forces of democracy are making some political and economic
inroads, although the U.S.S.R. is not yet headed to democracy as we
know it,'' he said.
   Webster said the Soviet reform effort presents the intelligence
community with some very formidable challenges.
   ``We must manage the information explosion that glasnost has
produced, which, though very welcome and very healthy in any respect
you look at, challenges us in intelligence to sort out what is
important and what is not _ from a large volume of information that
was not previously available _ and what is real versus what Moscow
wants us to hear.''

   The disappearance of four young people
over the weekend still had police baffled four days later, and the
youths' parents offered a $20,000 reward Wednesday for information
in the case.
   ``We don't have indication of foul play. But the longer time goes
on, the more unusual the situation and the less likely it is the
kids are out on a lark,'' said state police spokeswoman Marcy Stamm.
``You'd think one of the kids would have called by now.''
   State police have issued a nationwide alert for the car the four
were last seen in and distributed a missing persons' flier
nationally.
   The missing friends, three 19-year-old women and a 20-year-old
man, were last seen Saturday night at an apartment near Southern
Connecticut State University in New Haven.
   The missing teen-agers are: Jill Sawyer, a student at the
University of Rhode Island; Christy Stevens, a student at Mohegan
Community College in Norwich; Michael Gallo, a student at Southern
Connecticut; and Laura Lagrotteria, who works at the Crystal Mall in
Waterford.
   Stamm said the four had about $50 among them and no change of
clothes. She said extensive interviews with friends and family gave
no indication the group had planned to run away.
   Their parents, who reported them missing Sunday night, announced
through state police a $10,000 reward and doubled it later Wednesday.
   Family and friends described the four 1987 graduates of East Lyme
High School as responsible adults, not likely to take off without
telling anyone.
   Stevens' father, James O. Stevens, said the three women had been
close friends since grade school. He said although they knew Gallo,
they had not seen him much until recently.
   ``If Christy was going to come in later than 2 a.m., we would
always get a call telling us she would be late,'' Stevens said.
   A state police airplane traced all possible routes the four could
have taken from East Lyme to New Haven but turned up no sign of
Stevens' car.

   The mayor was acquitted Tuesday of charges
he misused city money and swindled three businessmen.
   A St. Louis County District Court jury reached the verdict after
more than six hours of deliberations following two weeks of
testimony.
   Mayor John Fedo sat motionless while the verdicts were read, then
embraced his attorney, Douglas Sauter, who was crying.
   ``I don't think anyone could really describe the experience, so
I'm not going to try,'' Fedo said after leaving the courtroom.
   ``Everything that needed to be said was said in the courtoom,''
the mayor said, adding that he'd like to thank the people of Duluth
and tell them he'd now be ``back to work.''
   ``We have finally finished the election of 1987,'' Fedo said,
referring to his contention that the charges against him were
politically motivated by multimillionaire Jeno Paulucci and Fedo's
other political adversaries.
   Prosecutor Vernon Swanum would not comment, nor would jurors.
   Fedo faced eight felony charges and one gross misdemeanor count
charging him with falsifying travel expenses in 1985 and with
pocketing $13,500 he solicited from three Duluth businessmen.
   The travel-record charges stemmed from 1985, when, prosecutors
contended, Fedo made up names of guests when he actually dined at
city expense with Lory Cossi, who is now his wife. Fedo admitted
inaccuracies but said they resulted from failing to remember who was
there when asked by auditors months after the meals.
   No witnesses testified they saw Fedo spending the $13,500 from
the three businessmen on himself.

<HEAD>Dalai Lama Seeks Compromise Over Independence to Preserve Tibet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama, spiritual and temporal
leader of Tibetans, says time is running out for preserving his
people's culture and the only way to save it may be a compromise
with China over independence.
   The man revered as a god-king by his people said in an interview
with The Associated Press that ``I am not insisting we should be an
independent country.''
   Instead, he said, he was seeking ``a middle way'' that would
preserve the culture he fears will vanish if China continues to rule
Tibet for another 10 or 15 years.
   The remarks sounded conciliatory, but the Dalai Lama insisted in
the interview Tuesday they were not a modification of a proposal he
made five months ago in which China would keep troops on Tibetan
soil and handle Tibet's foreign policy.
   Sitting in a suite at New Delhi's luxury Ashoka Hotel during a
trip to visit Tibetan refugees, the Dalai Lama repeatedly expressed
worries that time was running out to save his homeland.
   It was these concerns that prompted his June 15 proposal in
Strasbourg, France, where the European Parliament was meeting. In
that proposal, his biggest concession since China invaded Tibet in
1949 and annexed it a year later, he suggested Tibet become ``a
self-governing democratic political entity ... in association with
China.''
   The proposal drew criticism from Tibetan exiles around the world
and prompted a spate of protest letters to the Dalai Lama's own
exile headquarters in Dharmsala, a Himalayan foothills town 300
miles north of New Delhi.
   China rejected the proposal, saying it failed to relinquish the
concept of Tibetan independence, but said it is willing to talk to
the Dalai Lama.
   ``In a way, sad, but realistically, in order to save Tibetan
culture, Tibetan people, and find some kind of satisfaction for
them, as a free spokesman for Tibetan people, I make a suggestion or
proposal on a middle way,'' the Dalai Lama said in the interview.
   ``In the northeast part of Tibet, my birthplace area, already in
that part of Tibet, Tibetans (are) becoming insignificant, a small
minority,'' said the bespectacled Buddhist holy man.
   He said that according to Chinese statistics, the Tibetan
population in the area where he was born is 800,000 and the Chinese
population about 3 million.
   The Dalai Lama, whose name means Ocean of Wisdom, was born 53
years ago and named Tenzin Gyatso, one of seven children of a farmer
in the poor village of Tagtser. Tagtser now lies in China, outside
what Beijing has designated the Tibetan Autonomous Region.
   The creation of the region, shrinking the area Tibetans consider
Tibet, is the main reason why the Dalai Lama says there are 6
million Tibetans and China says there are 2 million. An influx of
Chinese settlers into the area, including the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa, has further diluted the once-homogenous Tibetan population.
   It also has spawned riots, such as the ones in Lhasa in October
1987 and again in March when cars were set afire, a police station
burned, and at least 35 Tibetans and three Chinese policemen killed.
   The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after an unsuccessful
uprising, said he thought non-violent tactics would be more
successful in attaining Tibetan control over internal Tibetan
affairs, such as education, health services, industry, mining and
construction of houses.
   At last, he said, the Chinese are finally recognizing Tibet as a
place with a cultural identity of its own.
   As evidence, he cited what he said was the establishment of a
center for Tibetan studies in Beijing and the willingness of Chinese
officials to meet a Tibetan delegation in Geneva in January. The
Dalai Lama said he did not plan to take part in any Geneva talks, at
least at the initial stage.
   Asked whether his proposals for Tibet could be construed as
autonomy within the Chinese nation, the maroon-and-gold robed Dalai
Lama said pensively: ``Autonomy. That's a nice word.''
   But his secretary for the past 15 years, Tenzin Geyche Tethong,
who holds Cabinet rank in the Tibetan government-in-exile,
interjected: ``We don't use the word autonomy.''
   After the interview, Tethong said: ``It's something that at this
point His Holiness does not want to be very specific about.''
   The Dalai Lama, whose status as god-king of the Tibetans began in
1940 when he was a 4-year-old child, travels with a retinue of
advisers, aides and bodyguards.
   His holy status was conferred when Buddhist monks decided he was
the 14th incarnation of the physical manifestation of the Buddhist
Lord of Compassion, Avalokitesvara. This decision was made when the
small boy was silently presented with a host of articles, ignored
most of them but picked out the only three that had belonged to the
13th Dalai Lama, who died in 1933.

   A man whose car plowed through the aisles
of a busy department store, killing one person and injuring 13,
tried to turn around and drive out of the building after the vehicle
reached the back, a witness said.
   The motorist, 72-year-old Louis Prosperi of Bloomfield, told
police ``he had a malfunction in the car,'' Lt. Joseph Simonetti
said Tuesday. The Cadillac was impounded for mechanical tests today,
Simonetti said.
   Prosperi was questioned and released after the accident Tuesday.
No charges were filed.
   The car crashed through the plate-glass front doors of a K mart
store around 2 p.m. and traveled about 100 feet, sending glass,
concrete, employees and customers into the air, Simonetti said.
   ``I just saw everybody flying,'' said Helen Romano, who was
standing outside. Ms. Romano said that after the car came to a stop
near the back of the store, Prosperi tried to turn it around and
drive out of the building.
   Clothing, cameras and jewelry were strewn across the store after
the accident. Aisles were demolished and black skid marks left on
the floor.
   Barbara Urbanovick, 37, of Nutley was pronounced dead at the
scene. Dorothy Becker, 65, was listed in guarded condition at
University Hospital in Newark.
   Twelve others were in stable condition at Clara Maass Medical
Center, three with leg and hip fractures and the rest with cuts and
bruises, said hospital spokesman Lew Gardner.

   Thousands of TV performers at the big three
networks reported for work without a new contract today as talks
continued.
   Talks between the networks and the 68,000-member American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists were extended on a
day-to-day basis before the three-year contract expired at midnight
Tuesday, union spokeswoman Pamm Fair said.
   ``Right now, they're really bargaining everything,'' Ms. Fair
said, adding that a strike was still a possibility.
   The contract affects all of the network news broadcasts, sports
programs, soap operas, game shows and the variety shows ``Late Night
with David Letterman'' and ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny
Carson.''
   Those covered by the AFTRA contract include the anchormen Tom
Brokaw, Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and more than 3,000 other network
employees.
   Prime-time videotaped series like ``The Cosby Show,'' are not
affected. Actors on those shows, as well as those on filmed programs
such as ``Moonlighting,'' are covered by a separate agreement with
AFTRA and the Screen Actors Guild. That contract expires in July.
   Details of the talks, which begin Oct. 4, were not disclosed.
   Key issues include working conditions, the economic health of the
networks and job duties for news reporters. The talks, covering some
three dozen separate contracts, are being held at CBS headquarters
in New York.
   AFTRA members, who struck for several months in 1980, have
authorized a strike if the union's 150 directors are unhappy with
any proposed contract.
   Film and TV production was hobbled recently by a five-month
strike by scriptwriters and a three-week walkout by drivers,
laborers and electricians.

<TEXT>
   A Jewish leader who defended last
week's controversial Kristallnacht speech by the president of
Parliament quit today after being strongly criticized by other Jews,
officials said.
   Michael Fuerst, deputy chairman of the national Jewish council,
had been harshly criticized for comments he made following
Thursday's speech of then-Parliament President Philipp Jenninger.
   Jenninger reminded his audience that many Germans initially
welcomed Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and recalled that many people
thought the Jews deserved being ``put back in their place.''
   Jenninger also called the early Nazi years a ``triumphal
procession.''
   Hours later, Fuerst told a nationally televised panel discussion:
``I welcome the fact that the Parliament president described in full
clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938 ...
especially the fact that everything Hitler did was strongly
supported by the masses of all Germans.''
   Anger over the speech mounted at home and abroad, and Jenninger
quit the next day. He said he had been misunderstood but also told
nationwide television, ``You can't call everything by its name in
Germany.''
   Jenninger, 56, gave the speech on the 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, the night of terror against the Jews that signaled
the coming Holocaust.
   Fuerst, 41, told The Associated Press on Monday he fully
supported what he said last week. He said he had received numerous
telephone calls of approval.
   ``I've been confirmed in that opinion by the many people who have
called me since then,'' he told the AP. He acknowledged, however,
that a ``majority'' of West Germany's Jewish community felt
differently.
   Council chairman Heinz Galinski, who had led the criticism
against his own deputy, today made the announcement of Fuerst's
resignation.
   ``He gave as a reason the long-standing lack of agreement between
me and himself,'' Galinski, a 75-year-old Auschwitz survivor, told
the AP at a council meeting in Frankfurt.
   Galinski said the rest of the national council leadership stood
behind him ``100 percent.'' He has been at the forefront of
condemning Jenninger's speech.
   Fuerst was at the meeting but not immediately available for
comment.
   The Jenninger dispute has intensified West Germany's debate over
the haunting legacy of the Third Reich.
   Many people, like Fuerst, have cautiously approved of the
Christian Democratic politician's reminders of how the Germans
initially greeted Hitler.
   ``The part about the people staying silent, giving approval, and
that it could happen among a majority of the Germans _ people say
that very seldom,'' said Parliament member Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher.
   Galinski said that if Fuerst had not resigned, the council would
have taken a vote of no confidence against him. There are 18 council
members, and 16 were at today's meeting.
   Council member Nathan Kalmanowicz, from Munich, said all but one
or two of the council members made clear they wanted Fuerst to step
down.
   ``He had no chance. The overwhelming majority was against him, it
was not just us but the whole Jewish community,'' he said.
   A successor for Fuerst will be chosen when elections for all 18
council members are held in January or February.

   The FBI and U.S. attorney's office have
joined the investigation into an attack by suspected
white-supremacist ``skinheads'' that left a black man dead and two
others injured, a federal prosecutor says.
   Mulugeta Seraw, a 27-year-old Ethiopian immigrant, died after
being beaten with a baseball bat and kicked by three men who may be
``skinheads,'' young toughs blamed for violence against minorities
around the nation, police said.
   Two other Ethiopian men, friends who had dropped Seraw off in
front of his apartment early Sunday, were injured when they tried to
intervene.
   Police said the attackers had shaved heads and wore military
jackets. Investigators had no other leads, police spokesman Dave
Simpson said Tuesday.
   U.S. Attorney Charles Turner said investigators would try to
determine ``whether there were any ties by the assailants to
individuals or organizations outside the state and, number two,
focus on the racial aspects of the killing.''
   Elsewhere, five teen-agers who appeared to be linked to the
skinhead movement were arrested in the vandalizing of a synagogue in
San Diego. Police said swastikas and hate slogans were painted on
the outside walls of Tiffereth Israel Synagogue early Sunday, and
two cars and a home nearby were damaged.
   ``They talked a little bit (during questioning) about skinhead
activity and their knowledge of skinheads, so we think they're
affiliated,'' said San Diego police Capt. Mike Tyler. ``I certainly
see that whole skinhead ideology (in the incident).'' He added that
except for one girl, they ``were not remorseful at all.''
   The five, all 16, were booked for investigation of felony
vandalisim of a place of worship with intent to intimidate.
   In Portland, Turner said that filing of federal civil rights
charges would be considered only if state officials failed to pursue
the more serious homicide charges. ``And I don't expect that in this
case,'' he added.
   ``Mr. Turner has been very cooperative with us,'' said Betre
Melles of the Ethiopian Community Organization. ``I think that sends
a message to the community.''
   Seraw's uncle, Engedaw Berhanu of San Francisco, said the attack
on his nephew was unprovoked. ``I don't think we have any doubt that
a brutal murder has been committed by some racial hate group,'' he
said.
   ``Of course, it leaves us (blacks) in fear and uncertainty,'' he
said.
   Seraw immigrated from Ethiopia seven years ago and worked at a
car rental business.
   Skinheads have been linked to at least two other slayings: the
beating death in December of a black man in Tampa, Fla., and the
stabbing in February of a white man who took a black friend to a
party in Santa Clara County, Calif.

   Leftist opposition parties were
headed for victories in major cities today while President Jose
Sarney's right-centrist party suffered a major setback, according to
early election returns.
   Vote counting began at 8 a.m. in most cities. The early results
confirmed exit polls Tuesday that indicated a surprisingly strong
showing by leftist and populist candidates.
   The big surprise was the projected victory of Luiza Erundina, of
the socialist-oriented Workers Party, as mayor of Sao Paulo,
Brazil's largest city and financial center.
   With 4 percent of the ballots counted, Ms. Erundina had 29
percent of the vote, while wealthy conservative industrialist Paulo
Maluf had 25 percent.
   Ms. Erundina, 53, is a social worker from Brazil's poor northeast
region. Considered a militant within the party, she has led land
takeovers by poor squatters.
   Asked if she thought of herself as a radical, Ms. Erundina told
reporters, ``Yes, if it means defending workers' rights.''
   The Workers Party, led by former union president Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva, also was expected to win mayoral elections in the state
capitals of Porto Alegre and Vitoria. Brazil has 26 states.
   In Rio, Brazil's second-largest city, former mayor Marcello
Alencar of the leftist Democratic Labor Party held the lead with 4
percent of the votes counted. Polls gave Alencar 38 percent of the
vote, compared with 22 percent for the Workers Party.
   In Belo Horizonte, Brazil's No. 3 city, Joao Pimenta da Veiga
Filho, of the leftist Brazilian Social Democracy Party, was the
projected winner by a slim margin over the Workers Party.
   The big loser appeared to be Sarney's Democratic Movement Party,
which was leading in four state capitals. In the last municipal
election in 1985, it won 17.
   Gov. Pedro Simon of Rio Grande do Sul state acknowledged his
party's defeat but said, ``At least now the voters can't blame us
for everything that goes wrong with Brazil.''
   Conservative parties to the right of Sarney's group were
projected as winners in capitals of eight smaller, mostly rural
states. Other races were too close to call, and results from some
remote states in the Amazon region were not in.
   From the pampas to the far northern Amazon jungle, more than 75
million Brazilians waited in long lines under hot sun to choose from
among 1.2 million candidates from 29 parties.
   City streets were littered with pamphlets and streamers when the
polling stations closed at 5 p.m. Tuesday, sealing elections for
mayorships and city councils in 4,307 cities and towns.
   Rep. Ulysses Guimaraes, leader of the Democratic Movement Party,
called the election a ``fantastic spectacle of democracy.''
   The conservative mayor of Sao Paulo and former president, Janio
Quadros, warned that the victory by left-wing candidates was a
``threat to democracy.''
   Although voting was based largely on local matters, political
analysts say Brazilians marked votes for or against Sarney's party.
   The Democratic Movement Party has been blamed for 30 percent
monthly inflation and a 40 percent dip in workers' buying power, and
it has faced charges of corruption. A recent wave of nationwide
strikes has piled more criticism on the Sarney government.
   Sarney, a 58-year-old politician and poet, took office in 1985 as
the running mate of Tancredo Neves, who was chosen in a
military-controlled electoral college vote. Neves died shortly
before taking office.
   The election was viewed as an important indicator of party
popularity as Brazil prepares for presidential elections in 1989,
the first such vote in 29 years.
   Federal troops were stationed in 15 states and 271 municipalities
to keep order.
   Police arrested some campaign workers for violating a law
prohibiting last-minute electioneering next to polling stations, but
no serious incidents were reported.
   Though voting is mandatory in Brazil, in recent weeks a campaign
by a satirical newspaper urged voters to write in a chimpanzee in
the Rio zoo as mayor. The measure was to register the general lack
of confidence in politicians.

<HEAD>Judge Says Anti-Apartheid Coalition Was Directed By ANC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's largest
anti-apartheid group operated under the guidance of the outlawed
African National Congress, a judge said today as a three-year
treason trial neared its end.
   The 19 black activists on trial include senior leaders of the
United Democratic Front, a now-banned coalition formed in 1983 to
mobilize opposition to apartheid and white-minority domination. The
defendants have denied allegations that they encouraged
anti-government violence.
   Supreme Court Justice Kees van Dijkhorst will issue his verdict
within the next few days after he finishes reading aloud in court a
1,521-page summary of the trial. He began the process Tuesday, when
he revoked the bail of eight of the defendants.
   In the section of the summary read today, van Dijkhorst said he
agreed with prosecutors that the United Democratic Front was
supported and directed by the ANC, the country's main
anti-government guerrilla movement.
   The front has maintained it endorsed the African National
Congress' political goals, such as a one-person, one-vote system,
but did not approve of the use of violence.
   ``To side wholeheartedly with the ANC _ and then to say that the
UDF is neutral _ is to twist that word out of joint,'' van Dijkhorst
said.
   He said the group's leaders had participated in rallies where
crowds chanted in support of the ANC and sang ``revolutionary''
songs.
   A 1985 United Democratic Front statement calling for ``the
collapse of the system'' was ``an unequivocal declaration of war on
the state,'' the judge said.
   The three most prominent defendants at the trial are senior front
leaders who have been denied bail throughout the trial and have
spent 40 months in jail: Popo Molefe, 36, who was the group's
national secretary; Terror Lekota, 40, its publicity secretary, and
Moses Chikane, 40, secretary of the Transvaal Province branch.
   All 19 defendants have pleaded innocent to charges of treason,
terrorism, murder and subversion related to a central allegation
that the front and its affiliates sought to promote violence to make
South Africa ungovernable.
   The charges arise from violence and mob killings in black
townships south of Johannesburg in September 1984, the start of two
years of nationwide unrest in which more than 2,500 people were
killed.
   Treason and murder carry a maximum penalty of death.
   Van Dijkhorst has presided over the non-jury trial since its
start in June 1985 and has sole responsibility for the verdict and
sentencing.
   Founded in 1983, the United Democratic Front became the largest
and in many ways the most potent opposition group in South Africa's
history, encompassing more than 600 affiliated groups with about 2
million members. In February it was banned from any activities.
   The trial, conducted for many months in the town of Delmas before
being shifted to Pretoria, originally had 22 defendants. Three men
were acquitted in 1986.

   A teen-ager says a man bearing a striking
resemblance to Elvis Presley forced her at gunpoint to drive to
Alabama and sang along with the radio during the trip.
   ``He might have looked like Elvis, but he sure didn't sing like
him,'' University of South Florida freshman Wendy Durgan said after
returning safely to her parents' Tampa home Tuesday.
   Ms. Durgan, 18, said she was abducted Sunday in the parking lot
of the restaurant where she worked as a waitress. She said the man
kept the gun in his hand throughout the 10-hour trip but didn't
point it at her once they were on the road.
   The gunman directed the young woman to drive to the Birmingham
Municipal Airport, where he told her to go inside and wait. When she
returned with an airport officer, the car was there but the man was
gone, she said.
   FBI agents were looking for a man in his early to mid-30s.
Investigators had no motive and few leads, said agent Lou Brannon.

   Sen. John Kerry apologized today for a telling
a joke about Dan Quayle that offended some.
   At a businessmen's breakfast Tuesday, Kerry responded to a
question about the vice president-elect's qualifications by saying
``the Secret Service is under orders that if Bush is shot, to shoot
Quayle,'' The Boston Herald reported.
   The Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement today: ``I
shouldn't have repeated the story. It was inappropriate and I
apologize for doing so.'' Through spokesman Larry Carpman, Kerry
said he had been quoting a joke that was going around the capital.
   The breakfast, sponsored by an East Lynn bank, drew about 120
businessmen, bankers, lawyers and other professionals. The newspaper
said some audience members, which it did not quote by name,
complained about Kerry's remark.
   Carpman said Kerry recalled that he had followed his comment to
the group with a disclaimer: ``I don't mean that. I'm just relating
what some people are saying in Washington.''
   Jeff Nesbit, an aide to the Indiana senator, said, ``I personally
don't think the health of the president or vice president is
anything to joke about.''

<HEAD>Business Inventories Jumped 0.7 Percent in September</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories jumped 0.7 percent in
September, the 21st consecutive monthly increase, while sales
remained virtually unchanged, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots rose $5.5 billion to a seasonally adjusted $749.4 billion,
while sales fell a scant $35 million to $495.4 billion.
   The combination of rising inventories and flat sales is a sign of
economic weakness. If the trend continued, it could lead to fewer
orders from retailers, so they could sell off their backlog of
goods, and consequently to production cutbacks and layoffs at
manufacturing plants.
   However, business sales have been generally strong this year and
economists said the gain in inventories during most months was in
line with sales.
   The September inventory increase followed a large 1.1 percent
gain in August and a 0.7 percent rise in July. The last decline was
in December 1986.
   The small September decline in sales snapped a string of nine
consecutive increases. They had shot up 1.3 percent in August and
rose a slight 0.1 percent in July.
   Inventory accumulation in September was led by a substantial 1.5
percent rise at retailers, where sales were the weakest. Wholesale
inventories rose only 0.1 percent, while inventories at factories
increased 0.6 percent.
   In sales, a 0.1 percent dip at manufacturing plants and a 0.3
percent decline at retail stores offset at 0.5 percent increase at
the wholesale level. Sales have been particularly strong at the
manufacturing level this year because of an export boom fueled by
the lower value of the dollar.
   An advance estimate of retail sales for October, released
Tuesday, showed a strong 0.9 percent gain, evidence that the
accumulation of inventories may have moderated somewhat as the
fourth quarter began.
   The combination of an increase in inventories and steady sales
left the inventory-to-sales ratio at 1.51 in September, up from 1.50
during the three previous months. That means it would take 1.51
months to exhaust inventories at the September sales pace, a ratio
not considered unusually high.

<HEAD>Kampelman: Both Sides Studying Treaty Draft</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Kampelman throughout</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet arms negotiators have made ``a
tremendous amount of progress'' in the latest four-month round of
talks on a long-range nuclear arms reduction treaty, the Reagan
administration's chief negotiator said today.
   The 10th round of talks adjourned in Geneva on Tuesday with many
items still unresolved in efforts to draft a treaty to cut
long-range nuclear forces in half, said U.S. negotiator Max
Kampelman.
   But, he added, ``there was a tremendous amount of progress'' in
the latest round of talks.
   On Tuesday, Soviet officials said they hoped for ``new progress''
in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, talks under the
George Bush administration.
   ``We have even a joint draft of this treaty and it's now more
than 300 pages long,'' Kampelman said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   ``We're exchanging these joint draft texts. They're very
important,'' said Kampelman, who just returned from the talks.
``We'll all study them during the course of this break and continue
the progress that we have made in resolving a great many of the
differences.''
   He declined to discuss whether he would continue to lead the
talks after President-elect George Bush takes office Jan. 20, but
said new approaches could be useful and ``there are no indispensable
people in any process.''
   Kampelman said negotiators on both sides hope to ``continue the
progress that we have made in resolving a great many of the
differences.''
   ``Even though a great many issues still remain to be resolved, I
am impressed with how many agreements we already have,'' Kampelman
said.
   Bush has been to Geneva and met with both sides in the talks,
which have been going on for nearly four years.
   ``We're engaged in something that's never been done before,''
Kampelman said, ``and we're doing it well, we're doing it slowly,
we're doing it carefully, because these are important issues of
national security.''
   Kampelman said he has no indication of what might occur at the
planned December meeting with Bush, President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Kampelman was asked what the U.S. response would be to any
surprise move by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during a meeting
with President Reagan and Bush in December. ``We'd welcome any kind
of move by the Soviets which is constructive,'' he said. ``There are
many areas they have to move on. I think they know that, and if Mr.
Gorbachev wants to do so, we would welcome it.''
   On Tuesday in Geneva, Kampelman said he assured the Soviets that
Bush would maintain continuity in the talks.
   The latest round of talks began July 12, involving both START and
space defense issues. The talks, which began in March 1985, produced
the U.S.-Soviet agreement to scrap all intermediate-range nuclear
missiles.
   U.S. negotiator Read S. Hanmer said Wednesday that differences
were narrowed on air-launched cruise missiles and on monitoring
mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles if they are included in
the treaty. But he said a longstanding disagreement remains over the
range an air-launched cruise missile must have to be included in the
treaty.
   Kampelman said no progress was made on sea-launched cruise
missiles, which Moscow wants to limit.
   He also said Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative program for
space-based missile defenses, which the Soviets oppose, remains a
``serious objective'' and is not expected to be a bargaining chip
under Bush.
   The program, known as Star Wars, has been a stumbling block since
the talks began.

   A former white policeman
laughed as he walked along a downtown Pretoria street, casually
shooting to death six blacks and wounding 16, witnesses said today.
   Three of the people injured Tuesday in Pretoria died in a
hospital overnight, raising the death toll to four men and two
women, police said. The gunman, identified as Barend Strydom, 23,
surrendered to two black policemen after the shooting spree.
   Police said he had resigned in February after an internal
investigation found him guilty of ``improper behavior'' that
included ``possession of radical right-wing documents.'' Minister of
Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said Strydom is a member of the neo-Nazi
Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   ``I saw a stockily built man, smiling and laughing and wearing a
camouflage jacket walk up to people on the square brandishing a
pistol,'' said Igshaan Hoosen, a white radio shop salesman who said
he saw the gunman get out of a van and begin the shootings.
   ``He walked over to a woman, pointed a pistol at her body and
shot her in the side. Her little boy stood there dumbstruck,''
Hoosen said. ``Then he turned the pistol on two men standing on
either side of the woman and shot them.''
   Laughing openly, the gunman then walked along the street in front
of the State Theater, Hoosen said, ignoring whites and picking out
blacks as targets.
   ``He snapped off a shot at the entrance and then his attention
was caught by a black man walking towards him. He walked up to the
man, still smiling, and shot him in the head. Then he sauntered up
to an elderly black street cleaner who was standing transfixed in
shock. The gunman shot him at point-blank range, too,'' he said.
   Hoosen said the gunman then calmly removed the empty clip from
his 9mm automatic pistol, took a new magazine from his pocket and
reloaded. He walked two more blocks, where other witnesses said he
continued to smile and fire random shots at blacks until he was
detained.
   Police gave no details about how the arrest was made.
   Vlok said in a statement that during the shooting, the suspect
claimed he was the leader of a shadowy right-wing vigilante group
called the White Wolves.
   According to local news reports, Strydom sent a statement to the
media after his ouster from the police force.
   In the statement, he reportedly said police had confiscated
documents related to the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement and
also had found a photograph showing Strydom with a knife in one hand
and the head of a decapitated black man in the other.
   ``The purpose of the photograph was to frame it with the heading
`ANC: Beware,''' Strydom reportedly said in the statement. The ANC
is the African National Congress, the outlawed, predominantly black
guerrilla movement fighting to overthrow the government.
   In a related development, a man claiming to be the leader of the
White Wolves called the Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld late
Monday and threatened to kill President P.W. Botha if he releases
jailed black leader Nelson Mandela.
   Botha spoke Monday night in Pretoria to his National Party's
Transvaal provincial congress, but made no mention of Mandela, the
country's best known black leader and head of the ANC. Mandela has
been jailed for 26 years.
   Beeld reporter Tim du Plessis said the Afrikaans-speaking caller
said ``something'' would happen Tuesday to prove the seriousness of
the White Wolves.
   A delegate to the National Party congress made an urgent motion
today demanding the white minority government immediately ban the
Afrikaner Resistance Movement.

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army today confined
nearly 900,000 Palestinians to their homes, but Palestinian youths
defied the orders and hurled stones at soldiers. Two teen-agers were
reported shot.
   In the Gaza Strip, a curfew was in effect for a sixth straight
day. On Tuesday, some Arabs celebrated the Palestinian declaration
of independence in the streets with songs and fireworks. It is the
longest the seaside area has been shut by authorities since the 1967
Middle East war.
   Hundreds of soldiers patrolled in jeeps, trucks with plastic
shields to protect them from stones, and armored vehicles equipped
with machines to spray gravel at rioters.
   In the West Bank, soldiers carried out raids to prevent violence,
a military spokeswoman said. She said arrests were made, but she
would not say how many.
   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, fireworks continued into the
morning and dozens of outlawed Palestinian flags were hung on walls
and utility poles. Graffiti read ``Congratulations to our people _
the state is born.''
   Two teen-agers were shot by soldiers in Gaza City, apparently
after violating curfew orders, officials at Ahli Arab Hospital said.
One was a 14-year-old shot in the right arm and the other a
15-year-old wounded in the leg, they said.
   A military spokeswoman said there were incidents of
stone-throwing in the city but no injuries. Israel radio said the
closure order was issued after soldiers caught two youths and
accused them of inciting other youngsters to throw stones.
   Smoke from burning tires rose above the city. At least five tires
were seen aflame in a two-hour, army-conducted tour for reporters.
Stones were thrown at one journalists' car in a convoy guided by two
army jeeps.
   Soldiers banged on the closed metal doors on one street where a
tire burned. They pulled out a middle-aged man and ordered him to
douse the tire with water and clear the debris from the roadway.
   As the soldiers shouted at the man, more than a dozen youths in a
nearby alley made V for victory signs for the benefit of
photographers.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, armed forces chief of staff, said the
military will take whatever steps needed to keep the PLO declaration
of independence from fueling the 11-month Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. At
least 312 Arabs and 11 Israelis have been killed in the uprising.
There are 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied areas.
   ``The Israel Defense Forces will keep as many troops in the area
as is needed. We will continue to keep the quiet by keeping people
under curfew as necessary,'' he said on Israel radio.
   The military said it filedcomplaints against three Israeli
journalists whom it accused of violating orders prohibiting
reporters from entering the West Bank on Tuesday, the day the
independence declaration was declared.
   The three were caught in Al-Ittihad hospital in Nablus, said the
military spokeswoman. One of them, Joel Greenberg of the Jerusalem
Post, said the reporters were not aware of the military order.
   In the Gaza Strip, 650,000 Palestinians were under curfew. The
army said curfews requiring people to stay in their homes also were
in effect in the West Bank towns of Tulkarem, Qalqilya, Nura Shams
and Shuweika, where 85,000 Arabs live. A reporter in Nablus said
soldiers put the city of 120,000 under curfew.
   The army declared Ramallah a closed military area, preventing
people from entering or leaving the West Bank city of 40,000.

   A woman accused of posing as a nurse and
kidnapping a newborn from a hospital was desperate to have a son and
had convinced many people that she was pregnant, police said.
   Acqunetta Smith, 32, of Hot Springs was arrested Monday in the
kidnapping of Christopher Michael Jones from Doctors Hospital on
Nov. 1. She pleaded innocent Tuesday.
   ``There is no doubt that she had planned this over a period of
time,'' Detective Vicki Flint said. ``She had made everyone believe
she was carrying a baby.''
   Ms. Smith, who is divorced, has at least three children of her
own, one a boy. But Capt. Bob H. Moore said she wanted a son with
her current boyfriend, Floyd Hannah.
   ``They were very much wanting to have a baby boy,'' Moore said.
``Everybody thought she was'' pregnant.
   The infant's mother, Annette Thomas-Jones, had handed her
3-day-old son to a woman posing as a nurse who came into her
hospital room saying the baby needed to be weighed.
   Officers acting on a tip found the baby Monday at the home of Ms.
Smith, who had worked as a nurse's aide. A $27,500 reward will go to
the caller, police said.
   Authorities said Christopher, who had been born six weeks
premature, was well taken care of during the two weeks he was
missing. During that time, they had expressed fear that he could die
because of his premature state.
   Christopher's parents took the infant home Tuesday to his two
sisters, ages 5 and 8.
   ``We're all well-rested,'' a smiling Mrs. Thomas-Jones said as
she left Doctors Hospital, cradling the boy. ``I slept like a baby
myself.'' Mrs. Thomas-Jones previously expressed forgiveness for the
kidnapper.
   Ms. Smith told officers that the boy, whom she called Floyd Jr.,
was born Nov. 4 at a hospital in Hot Springs, but could not provide
documentation, Mrs. Flint said.
   ``The girl almost had me convinced this was her baby,'' Mrs.
Flint said. ``She played it to the max. But when she let me hold the
baby, I just felt inside myself that it was the baby we were looking
for.''
   Mrs. Flint said Ms. Smith did not resist when the detective and
an FBI agent suggested they take the child to the medical center.
   ``She just kept repeating, `That's my baby,''' Mrs. Flint said.
   Ms. Smith was a nurse's aide at St. Joseph's Hospital until she
quit in September, saying she had problems with a pregnancy.
   She had a medical procedure known as a dilation and curettage in
July, but the reason wasn't known, police said. The procedure
removes matter from the uterus. For a pregnant woman, it amounts to
an abortion, but D and Cs also are done on women who are not
pregnant.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Vacates Stay on Execution of Gandhi Killers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today vacated a stay on
the execution of two Sikhs sentenced to death by hanging for the
1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the United News
of India reported.
   The action removed any legal bars to the execution of the two
Sikhs, who also have the right to petition President Ramaswamy
Venkataraman for mercy. One already has filed the petition.
   The news agency said a two-judge panel dismissed a request to
stay the execution pending resolution of a murder complaint filed by
one of the Sikhs in a magistrate's court. The panel earlier granted
a temporary stay while the petition was being heard.
   Satwant Singh, convicted for killing Mrs. Gandhi, has filed a
complaint against two policemen in the former prime minister's
security guard, claiming they shot at him and Beant Singh, another
Sikh involved in the assassination, after they were disarmed.
   Beant Singh received fatal injuries in the shootout and Satwant
Singh was arrested and charged after being treated for bullet wounds.
   The Singhs were not related. All Sikhs take the name ``Singh,''
which means ``lion'' in the Punjabi language, as a doctrine of the
faith.
   Beant Singh's maternal uncle, Kehar Singh, also was arrested and
convicted on charges of conspiracy. The death sentences against him
and Satwant Singh were delivered by a trial court and upheld by the
Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court.
   Satwant Singh's complaint against the policemen will be ruled on
Thursday.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed in her New Delhi residence on
Oct. 31, 1984, apparently in revenge for an army attack she ordered
four months previously on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest
Sikh shrine.
   The shrine, in the northern state of Punjab, was being used as a
base by militant Sikhs fighting for an independent homeland. At
least 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died in the army attack.
   Sikhs, known for their flowing beards and untrimmed hair, form
only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are a majority in
Punjab.
   Radical Sikhs have been campaigning for a separate state since
1982, claiming the community was being discriminated against by
Hindus, who make up 80 percent of the population.
   This year, at least 2,275 people have been killed in Punjab by
the radicals.

   Here, at a glance, are economic reports issued
Wednesday by the government.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Trade Deficit</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's merchandise trade deficit shrank nearly $2 billion
to $10.5 billion in September as exports hit a record high. The 15
percent improvement came from an August deficit revised up from
$12.18 billion to $12.3 billion. Imports declined slightly in
September from the record high $39.8 billion posted the previous
month, the Commerce Department said.
   The dollar drifted lower on European and Canadian markets, but
trading was thin because West German markets were closed for a
national holiday. Stock and bond prices on New York markets also
edged lower in early trading.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Business Inventories</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories jumped 0.7 percent in September, the 21st
consecutive monthly gain, and sales remained virtually unchanged,
the Commerce Department said. Inventories on shelves and backlots
rose $5.5 billion to a seasonally adjusted $749.4 billion. Sales
fell a scant $35 million to $495.4 billion.
   The combination of rising inventories and flat sales is a sign of
economic weakness. If the trend continued, it could lead to fewer
orders from retailers, so they could sell off their backlog of
goods, and consequently to production cutbacks and layoffs at
manufacturing plants.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Factory Use</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of capacity at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose
0.2 percentage points in October to 84.0 percent, the highest since
February 1980, the Federal Reserve Board said. The gain followed no
change in September, a 0.1 percentage point gain in August and a
sharp 0.7 percentage point rise in July.
   The overall rate is approaching the 85 percent threshold that
economists believe clearly signals a pickup in inflation.
   Capacity use has grown or held steady for eight consecutive
months, raising concern that factories will have trouble producing
enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price
increases.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulations limiting AIDS testing for insurance
were thrown out by Massachusetts' highest court today on grounds
that the state insurance commissioner lacked authority to issue the
rules.
   Authority to dictate such underwriting practices rests with the
Legislature, the Supreme Court said today in a unanimous ruling.
   Insurance Commissioner Roger Singer issued the regulations in
1987, making Massachusetts the second state, behind New York, to ban
by regulation health insurance testing for AIDS antibodies.
   Under the regulations, which never took effect, AIDS testing was
banned for all health insurance and group life and some disability
insurance.
   The Life Insurance Association of Massachusetts and several
insurance companies sued to block the regulations. In June, a
Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the insurance commissioner.
   The high court's ruling today focused only on the industry's
contention that Singer lacked authority to issue the regulations.
   The justices did not consider industry claims that the rules were
arbitrary and interfered with the rights of people not infected with
AIDS and the right of insurers not to enter into contracts.
   Singer claimed authority to issue the regulations under a 1924
law outlining his duties, but the court said it was doubtful the
Legislature intended that he be allowed to write regulations
dictating underwriting practices.
   ``We conclude that the commissioner had no authority, express or
implied, to adopt the regulations challenged in this case,'' Justice
Herbert P. Wilkins wrote.

   President Reagan said today that Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle will be welcome at the White House any
time, even though he wasn't invited to tonight's state banquet for
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Posing for photographers before a private meeting with Mrs.
Thatcher, Reagan was asked why Quayle had not been invited to the
gala dinner.
   ``You know, I don't get involved in the guest list there and I
don't know why, or whether this was some other engagement or not, so
I don't know the answer to that, but believe me, he will be welcome
any time,'' the president said.
   First Lady Nancy Reagan's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said
earlier that the omission of Quayle was not intended as a slight to
the vice president-elect. She said Quayle, a Republican senator from
Indiana, had been invited to a state dinner in 1982 and his turn in
rotation among the 100 senators had not yet come up again.
   As vice president, Quayle will automatically be invited to all
state dinners, Mrs. Crispen said.

   A man wanted for attempted murder in
Wisconsin wounded a state trooper and a security guard early today,
then shot himself in the head as police closed in, authorities said.
   The gunman, Phuoc Tri Nguyen, 36, and Trooper Jose Rangel, 33,
were in critical condition, while the security guard was treated for
an arm wound, said Trooper Glenn Koski, a police spokesman.
   Nguyen also robbed a Belvidere service station during the crime
spree, locking an attendant in a washroom and taking $160, said Sgt.
Tami Haukedahl.
   ``They said he (Nguyen) lost his job and kind of went bananas,''
said Haukedahl. It was not immediately known how Nguyen was employed.
   Police had sought Nguyen in the shooting Sunday of his landlord,
John Pietruscka, said Milwaukee police Lt. David Brues. Pietruscka,
74, was listed in critical condition today.
   The string of shootings began early today, Haukedahl said, when
Nguyen failed to pay a toll on Interstate 90. Rangel followed the
car and was shot in the abdomen when he approached, she said.
   Rangel and his partner returned fire, but the car sped off.
Minutes later, Nguyen drove to a car dealership, where he was
confronted by Michael T. Glee, an 18-year-old security guard. Nguyen
shot Glee, Haukedahl said.
   About 2:15 a.m., Nguyen robbed a gas station, Haukedahl said.
   Shortly afternward, a Belvidere patrolman pulled over Nguyen's
car. Nguyen shot himself in the head after backup police officers
arrived, Haukedahl said.

   A woman offered to sell her 3-month-old daughter to
two undercover officers for $550 so she could bail her husband out
of jail, police said.
   Zenobia Morales, 18, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of selling
a child and was jailed on $3,500 bail, authorities said.
   Two police officers posing as a married couple interested in
buying an infant visited Mrs. Morales after receiving an anonymous
call Tuesday from a person who said the mother wanted to sell the
baby, police said.
   Mrs. Morales told the officers the bail bondsman would take $600
cash, but she accepted $550, wrapping the infant in a blanket and
handing the baby over, police said.
   Her daughter and her two other children _ ages 18 months and 3
years _ were taken into state custody.
   Her husband, Francisco Morales, 27, has been held since Thursday
on $4,715 bail on a charge of burglary of a motor vehicle and
several misdemeanors.
   Baby selling carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and
a $5,000 fine.

   New York state health officials and gay
rights activists won a court battle to prevent AIDS from being
classified a communicable and sexually transmissible disease.
   Such a classification under the Public Health Law would have
required doctors to contact sexual partners of infected patients and
would have given local health officials power to quarantine AIDS
patients, officials said.
   Justice F. Warren Travers of New York state's trial-level Supreme
Court, in a ruling made public Tuesday, rejected an attempt by
doctors to force designation of the disease as sexually
transmissible.
   The lawsuit was brought by the Medical Society of the State of
New York and other doctors' groups against the state Health
Department and its policy-setting arm, the state Public Health
Council.
   By keeping AIDS off the list of sexually communicable diseases,
the Health Council has maintained it has been able to protect the
confidentiality and rights of AIDS patients.
   Listing of AIDS, which is transmitted primarily through sexual
contact and the sharing of infected needles by drug abusers, would
do more harm than good, they argued.
   Currently, people who test positive for the virus in a voluntary
test are counseled to encourage their sexual partners to be tested.
   The Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City called the court
ruling ``a victory for both public health and common sense.''
Listing of AIDS as communicable ``would have completely eliminated
voluntary and anonymous testing,'' said Thomas J. Sweeney, the
group's deputy executive director for policy.
   Health Department spokesman Peter Slocum said he was delighted
with the decision. ``It rejects arguments based on ignorance and
fear which would have called for the indiscriminate mass testing
with no particular benefit,'' he said.
   Frances Tarlton, Health Department spokeswoman, said the
department never denied that AIDS was sexually transmissible. What
the ruling means, however, is that Health Commissioner David Axelrod
has the authority to decide ``what diseases should be listed (as
reportable) in the best way to protect the public.''
   B.J. Costello, a lawyer for the physicians' groups, said they
would appeal. He said there are ``vast numbers of people who have no
idea they have the virus, and physicians can do nothing when they
see the symptoms.''
   ``My clients are committed to a solution that will alter current
escalating figures of AIDS patients in the state,'' Costello said.
As of October, New York state had about 19,000 of the almost 75,500
diagnosed AIDS cases in the United States.

   The Justice Department has cleared its top
anti-pornography prosecutor of allegations that he ordered the
destruction of a sensitive document and that he traveled at taxpayer
expense to religious meetings.
   In a two-sentence letter, Michael Shaheen, head of the Office of
Professional Responsibility, said that a criminal investigation of
H. Robert Showers has been concluded and that the allegations ``were
not substantiated and this office considers the matter closed.''
   OPR is the unit that examines accusations of improper conduct or
criminal activity by Justice Department employees.
   The letter, sent to Showers' attorney, Stephen H. Galebach, did
not specify the allegations.
   But government sources have said Showers came under scrutiny
earlier this year after he allegedly asked a colleague to destroy a
memo in connection with a pornography case.
   In addition, said the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, investigators tried to determine whether Showers
scheduled official trips at taxpayer expense that permitted him to
attend meetings of Christian religious groups in his hometown of
Raleigh, N.C., and other cities.
   Showers in 1986 was chosen to head the Justice Department's
National Obscenity Enforcement Unit by then-Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   He had been an assistant U.S. attorney in Raleigh before coming
to Washington as a special assistant to Meese.
   Showers, a deputy assistant attorney general, had been placed on
administrative leave.

<TEXT>
   An investigator says he was shocked
to learn it wasn't the drugs administered by Dr. Peter Rosier that
ultimately killed Rosier's cancer-stricken wife, but the smothering
hands of her stepfather.
   But by then it was too late _ the stepfather had already been
granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony
against Rosier, James Fitzpatrick said Tuesday at Rosier's trial for
the murder of his wife, Patricia.
   Fitzpatrick, chief investigator for the state attorney's office,
said he began his investigation in 1986 after Rosier said in a TV
interview that he helped his wife kill herself that same year.
   The investigator knew that Mrs. Rosier's stepfather, Vincent
Delman, and his two sons might have seen the death and would be
crucial witnesses.
   But the Delmans' attorney said the three would testify against
Rosier only in exchange for total immunity. Prosecutors agreed,
Fitzpatrick testified.
   Then Farrell Delman, the elder of the two sons, dropped a
bombshell, saying his father had smothered Mrs. Rosier as she lay
unconscious, with the sons helping, Fitzpatrick said.
   Rosier earlier had injected his wife with morphine and given her
morphine suppositories after she failed to kill herself with
sedatives, Fitzpatrick testified.
   But when those drugs also failed to kill her, the Delmans
suffocated her, he said.
   Fitzpatrick said he was shocked and angered by the revelation,
particularly since he had offered the Delmans immunity, but added:
``We had two choices. Drop the case or grant them immunity. ... You
never enjoy giving immunity to felons. ... We could not prosecute
Dr. Rosier without them, even though we did not know about the final
act.''
   Moreover, Rosier ``is the one responsible,'' Fitzpatrick said.
``He is the orchestrator. He is the planner. ... He got the drugs.''
   Rosier is charged with murder, attempted murder and conspiracy.
He said in an unpublished book that he was fulfilling his wife's
wish to die with dignity.
   Earlier Tuesday, Vincent Delman testified he decided to smother
Mrs. Rosier with his bare hands in part because Rosier was afraid
his wife would end up a ``vegetable'' because the morphine had not
worked.

the policemen went berserk, killed the other four with a machine gun
then took his own life with his service revolver.
   The news agency said at least 11 machine gun shells were found
along with two spent pistol shells. Bagnara di Romagna is a town of
2,000 people near Ravenna, 215 miles northeast of Rome.
   The Carabinieri _ Italy's elite, paramilitary police force _

<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea renewed its call
Wednesday for high-level political and military talks with rival
South Korea on ending military confrontation and easing tension on
the divided peninsula.
   In a letter delivered at the truce village of Panmunjom, North
Korean Prime Minister Lee Gun Mo proposed urgent talks in
mid-December to clear the way for a summit.
   The letter came on the eve of scheduled political discussions
between lawmakers from the two countries.
   Lee proposed the December talks be held with deputy prime
ministers and military chiefs of staff leading delegations of seven
to nine members.
   Seoul officials said the North Korean proposal offered nothing
new and was aimed mainly at removing 42,000 U.S. soldiers stationed
in South Korea.
   North Korea is ``putting emphasis on removing U.S. military
forces in South Korea,'' the South Korean Unification Ministry said.
   Lee said the North was seeking talks on a Nov. 7 communique,
which denounced the presence of U.S. troops as ``the root cause of
war'' and proposed phased withdrawl of American soldiers and the
reduction of armed forces to no more than 100,000 on each side by
1992.
   North Korea has proposed talks involving the two Koreas and the
United States to ease tension but did not call for U.S.
participation in the December meeting.
   Lee said in his letter that easing military tension would be the
first step to improving relations and the eventual reunification of
the peninsula, divided in 1945 when U.S. and Soviet troops ended
Japan's colonial occupation.
   ``Unless we do this, there cannot be substantial progress in
seeking peace and peaceful reunification,'' the letter said.
   South and North Korea in recent months have been swapping peace
proposals as part of an apparent propaganda war.
   North Korera invaded South Korea in 1950, sparking a three-year
war, and the two sides have clashed sporadically with no peace
treaty signed and hundreds of thousands of troops posed along their
sealed border.
   Past negotiations on improving ties have failed.
   Representives from both parliaments are to resume talks Thursday
to clear the way for full-scale parliamentary negotiations.
   In October, North Korea rejected South Korea's call for
six-nation talks involving the two Koreas, the United States, the
Soviet Union, China and Japan.
   Seoul officials believe the recent North Korean peace overture
appeared to have been promulgated out of jitters at South Korea's
diplomatic status bolstered by the successful staging of the
Olympics in Seoul.

   The Mappa Mundi, one of the most important

bankruptcy, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   The 13th century document, valued at more than $4.5 million, will
be sold at auction in June, said a spokesman for the cathedral, who

   The 6-by-4 map depicts historical events, biblical stories,
topography, flora and fauna.
   Medieval cartographers put Jerusalem at the center of the map,
while Hereford, about 140 miles northwest of London, is drawn on an
edge.
   The cathedral has owned the map for centuries, but says it must
be sold to pay a $270,000 debt and fund repairs.
   ``Faced with this situation, (the church) can see no alternative
but to offer for sale the single treasure, the Mappa Mundi,'' said
the spokesman.

   The visit to India by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev this weekend will focus on expanding trade,
sharing technology and the changing superpower relations, Indian and
Soviet officials said Wednesday.
   An agreement to increase the value of Soviet-Indian trade to $4.7
billion in 1989 was signed here Wednesday, more than double the
estimated level of $1.9 billion for 1987. Trade this year is
expected to reach a value about $3.4 billion, according to an
official Soviet report on trade published by Indian newspapers this
week.
   Other agreements to be signed after Gorbachev arrives Friday will
cover further cooperation in economic, cultural and energy sectors.
The Soviet leader is expected to hold at least four meetings with
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi during the three-day visit.
   ``The existing close political relationship will be reinforced by
intensifying economic cooperation and expanding the horizons of
people-to-people contacts,'' an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman
told reporters. Under briefing rules, he cannot be identified.
   He also said there would be discussions on ``the relationship
between the two superpowers and the likely shape these relations may
take with the new administration in the United States.''
   India, a fe the country.''
   Gorbachev's trip to India also comes a month before Gandhi is to
travel to China.
   The Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Gandhi-Gorbachev
talks ``will certainly focus on our developing relations with China
and the Soviet Union's relations with that country.''
   After a lengthy Moscow-Beijing estrangement, Gorbachev is to play
host to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the Soviet Union early next
year.

   Tulsa (Okla.) World on the PLO and Israel:
   To no one's surprise, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
move to formally recognize Israel's right to exist was dismissed in
advance by Israel's right-wing leadership. It will not be so easily
ignored in the United States.
   ... The United States has always said it would not talk to the
PLO until it recognized Israel's right to exist. Now that such a
step appears foregone, what will be the United States response?
   President Reagan, wisely, reacted to the news with caution.
``Apparently there has been an indication they're willing to abide
by (United Nations Resolution) 242,'' the president said. ``I hope
that is true because it would be some progress.''
   Caution is needed. Yasser Arafat and other PLO leaders, speaking
individually, have made rather dramatic peace gestures in the past
only to recant later.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on cost of supporting ex-presidents:
   When Ronald Reagan officially retires from the presidency in
January, it will be the first time in this century that four
ex-presidents will be living at the same time. That's more than a
historical footnote; it's a downright expensive proposition for
American taxpayers.
   In the 30 years since Congress formaly inaugurated a program for
the care and feeding of former presidents, the cost has increased a
hundredfold. The government will spend about $40 million on former
first families in 1989, $15 million alone on Reagan's first year of
retirement.
   Nobody begrudges Secret Service protection or the maintenance of
post-presidential office facilities for former chief executives. But
the biggest expense to taxpayers has nothing to do with
ex-presidential safety and comfort.
   Three dollars out of every five goes to maintain presidential
libraries, those combination archives and museums which have been
springing up after every change of administration since Herbert
Hoover.
   The libraries themselves, while built through private
contributions, are operated at taxpayer expense. What started out as
an annual $150,000 stipend now runs into the tens of millions.
   We need to take another look at the nation's presidential library
program with an eye to shifting more of the costs of operating them
to private foundations.
   Otherwise, let presidents simply turn their papers over to the
National Archives, where they probably belong in the first place.

   Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle and Times-Union on George
Bush's election and the deficit:
   The foreign investors who bankroll America's spending binge to
the tune of $100 billion a year don't care about George Bush's
``read my lips'' pledge.
   They care about their investments _ and thus about the federal
budget deficit.
   In the judgment of many economists, the president-elect will have
only until early spring to make headway on reducing the deficit.
   If he fails, says C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for
International Economics, look for ``a sharp fall in the dollar _ as
much as 20 percent to 25 percent. Inflation, double-digit interest
rates. Recession.''
   ... The new president will need great flexibility and bipartisan
support to manage the deficit, but Bush has tied his own hands and
alienated the congressional Democrats whose support he needs.
   ... If there's to be even a modest tax increase, Bush will have
to do more than agree to it. He will have to say, ``Read my lips: I
lied.''
   True, there is a certain poetic justice to Bush's predicament.
But soon he will be the president of all Americans; his predicament
will be ours.
   If he's willing to eat his words, Congress, and the public,
should let him.

   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on the resignation of William
Bradford Reynolds, the chief federal civil rights enforcer:
   William Bradford Reynolds officially leaves the Justice
Department on Dec. 9, and his legacy can be summed up in a single
word: bitterness.
   As President Reagan's chief civil rights enforcer, Reynolds so
alienated American blacks that they voted against Reagan in 1984 by
a margin of 9-to-1. That distrust continued to be reflected (Nov. 8)
... when blacks voted by nearly that same proportion against George
Bush, even though Bush once represented the kind of traditional
moderate Republicanism which, only 30 years ago, was drawing a
respectable share of the black vote.
   Reynolds no doubt took seriously his obligation to enforce the
law against such things as Ku Klux Klan terrorism, but this was
offset by his extremely constricted view of the law. He seemed to
feel that an absence of discrimination was the end of the federal
role in race relations. Out of this belief, he became a militant _
indeed, one could even say fanatic _ opponent of affirmative action
in any meaningful form. He did not seem to grasp the fact that
positive programs had to be pursued to overcome the effects of 300
years of slavery and segregation.
   No task of the Bush administration is more important than that of
beginning to repair the immense damage done by William Bradford
Reynolds in the past eight years.

   The Tennessean, Nashville, Tenn., on the homeless:
   About 2,000 people reflected credit on themselves and their
nation the other day when they marched in Washington, D.C., to
express concern for America's homeless.
   Some 377 of the marchers went one step further, engaging in
non-violent civil disobedience by sitting down in the middle of a
street. They were arrested for disorderly conduct.
   Meanwhile, in the ``City of Brotherly Love'' _ Philadelphia _ 29
homeless people occupy a federal building near the Liberty Bell.
They, too, were carted off to jail.
   And in Nashville on the same day, almost 100 mourners turned out
for the funeral of Ms. Carol Kessler, a street person who had some
in recent years to symbolize homelessness here.
   It was fitting that the protest demonstrations occurred the day
before the presidential election.
   The plight of the homeless was largely ignored during the
campaign by both parties, and that is a shame; it should be high on
everyone's list of priorities.

   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on an anchorwoman's censoring
of news for religious reasons:
   Should a journalist be guided by religious faith? Maybe the
answer is yes if the end result is compassion and a commitment to
doing right by viewers and readers.
   (Sioux Falls, S.D., TV anchorwoman) Marilee Joyce prevented
broadcast of network stories on the New Age movement and the Hare
Krishna sect. Those two stories alone may not taint the credibility
of television news, or of a newspaper.
   But there ought to be more to news judgment than sanitizing
events of the day, especially those with which we might disagree.
   Marilee Joyce took her task a step too far, by trying to mold the
news of the day into a world the way she wanted it to be. That's not
education; it's indoctrination.

   Six foreign journalists visiting
Afghanistan at government invitation were injured in a rebel attack
on a main eastern road Wednesday, official Afghan radio reported.
   The reporters, from the Soviet Union, France, Japan and India,
were taken to Kabul for treatment of unspecified injuries after the
attack on the highway linking the eastern border town of Torkham
with Jalalabad, according to the broadcast monitored in Islamabad.
   The broadcast was the first report by Kabul of foreign
journalists being injured while on an official government tour.
   Radio Kabul did not describe the attack nor further identify the
journalists. The report could not be independently verified.

<HEAD>Church Comes Out Against Plans to Close Shipyard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church on Wednesday
criticized government plans to close the Lenin Shipyard, the
birthplace of the Solidarity trade union.
   ``It is not a matter for the church to enter the sphere of purely
economic problems,'' said a statement issued by the Episcopate
Secretariat, which represents Roman Catholic Bishops nationwide.
``The government decision to close down the Gdansk Shipyard is a
political act not facilitating reconciliation.''
   The government announced the shipyard would be closed beginning
Dec. 1 because it was losing money. It now says closing the yard
will take 1{ years.
   The church statement also expressed concern that the decision
would block efforts to convene broad-based talks on Poland's future.
   ``It has also led to withdrawing the talks at the round table and
to blocking the emerging reconciliation of Poles,'' the statement
said.
   The authorities promised the talks during strikes in August, the
worst labor unrest in seven years.
   But government objections to the proposed participaton of
government critics and Solidarity advisers Adam Michnik and Jacek
Kuron have delayed the start of the talks.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa says he will not drop the two men
because that would create a precedent.
   The church statement also voiced disapproval of a strident media
campaign against social and trade union pluralism.
   ``The propaganda campaign against social pluralism, especially
against trade union pluraism which we have witnessed has not created
a favorable climate for those (round-table) talks,'' it said.
   The bishops called on authorities to fulfill a pledge to rehire
workers dismissed from their jobs for participation in the August
strikes, saying failure to do so had diminished the state's
credibility with society and with the church.
   Solidarity was crushed in 1981 and outlawed the following year
with the imposition of martial law.
   In another development, 51 activists continued a hunger strike
Wednesday to demand reinstatement of 49 miners and two steel workers
they say have yet to be rehired after the August strikes.
   The workers were holed up in Christ the King Cathedral in the
southern city of Katowice, where they took shelter Friday night
during a demonstration.

   Burning bits of newly harvested cotton
carried by swirling winds spread fire through the city, destroying
at least 29 houses and businesses, injuring 18 people and keeping up
to 400 from their homes today.
   The winds that had gusted to 65 mph and spread flames Tuesday
were tame today as police and firefighters conducted a
house-to-house search of the charred commercial and residential
area. No bodies were found, officials said.
   ``I can't imagine anyone thinking up a scenario like this where
there would be a fire break out in a field of cotton modules when
the wind is blowing 60 miles per hour. It sounds like a scene out of
a horror movie,'' said Gov. Henry Bellmon after a tour of the area
this morning.
   The fire, whose cause was unknown, spread to the city from giant
bundles of cotton stored in an open field.
   The fire skipped like a tornado through the residential area,
burning some houses and leaving others unscathed, the Oklahoma
Highway Patrol said.
   The destroyed cotton was probably worth about $3 million Police
Chief Jim Hughes said. He said 25 homes and four businesses were
destroyed and about 100 homes damaged by smoke, but he was unable to
estimate the cost of the damage.
   The blaze also destroyed a radio station transmitter and forced
the evacuation of two elementary schools and about 400 residents of
this southwest Oklahoma city of 23,000. Most evacuees were allowed
to return home by midday.
   Eighteen people were treated Tuesday for smoke inhalation, with
two admitted to the hospital as a precaution, Jackson County
Memorial Hospital said.
   The smoke, along with winds gusting from 50 mph to 65 mph, made
firefighting difficult and could be seen from 30 miles away.
   ``We couldn't see a hand or foot in front of our face,'' said
firefighter Eddie Williamson. ``We had to feel from house to house.''
   The cotton smoldering in the field looked like the last logs on a
huge campfire with the soft red afterglow of embers here and there
across the field.
   ``Those modules will burn probably two days. We've got a whole
field of cotton modules burning,'' Altus Civil Defense director
Dwight Dennis said.
   The giant bales, or nodules, were about 40 feet long, 8 feet high
and 8 feet wide, said city Administrator Joe Courtney. They were
awaiting processing at a cotton gin.
   Courtney said the city will seek state aid.
   The cause of the fire had not been determined. ``It's not
uncommon for a module to self-ignite under certain situations,''
Courtney said. ``It might sit out there and smother for two days and
we might not even be aware of it.''
   Altus firefighter Clay Richardson said that when he arrived about
50 minutes after the blaze was reported, 50 mph gusts kept
firefighters from being able to train water on the fire.
   ``There was fire all around us,'' Richardson said. ``We didn't
know where to go. It seemed like mass confusion.''
   The blaze crossed U.S. Highway 283 and destroyed a garden tool
shop, a moving and storage company, a motel, a number of homes and
damaged part of a mobile home park, officials said.
   ``When it crossed the highway that's when it got out of
control,'' Richardson said. ``All of the sudden it was phoom. The
wind was spreading debris.''
   Richardson said many firefighters suffered eye injuries from
blowing smoke and debris, including himself.
   City park crews and security officers from Altus Air Force Base
helped evacuate residents. Some stayed at motels or with friends or
relatives. About 65 were registered Tuesday evening to stay at a Red
Cross shelter.
   One of those evacuated, Joan Smith, said most of the people in
the shelter had homes to return to, but a few with small children
were not so fortunate.
   ``Some of the people came in here, and I heard them say that
their home is burned up,'' she said. ``I was just heartbroken.''

<HEAD>Challenger to Replace Circuit Breakers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Challenger Electrical Equipment Corp. is
offering to replace some household circuit breakers which may
contain a faulty part, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
reported Wednesday.
   No injuries have been reported, but the company said that quality
control testing disclosed the potential problem. The products in
question are 15 or 20-ampere type HAGF ground-fault, single-pole
circuit breakers.
   Circuit breakers are designed to protect people against electric
shock or fire by cutting off power in the event of a short or
overload.
   The breakers in question were made between Feb. 22 and April 29
of this year and were sold nationwide by electrical distributors,
hardware stores and lumber outlets, the company said.
   Thus, breakers which need replacement will only be found in
dwellings which have been constructed or in which electrical work
has been done since February.
   The devices are located in electrical service panels carrying the
name ``Challenger.'' The affected breakers have a yellow button and
the word ``test'' in raised letters on one side; on the other side
the number 15 or 20 is printed on the handle in white letters
between the words ``on'' and ``off.''
   If the number on the handle is black, or if there is a label with
white lettering next to the word ``test,'' then the HAGF circuit
breaker does not need to be replaced, the company said.
   Breakers which need replacing should be serviced by a licensed
electrician, the company said. Consumers who believe they have the
problem devices in their homes should contact Challenger by calling
1-800-541-8099. Mississippi residents can call collect to
601-948-3915.

   A radio station has decided not to drop its

television show ``WKRP in Cincinnati.''
   In fact, they're not even going to drop the 97 birds, but lower
them from a hovering helicopter at a shopping mall in a canvas net,
Kay Feeney, a producer for WENS-FM, said Wednesday.
   Representatives of the local and national Humane Society, and a
Sacramento, Calif., group for the protection of turkeys called to
complain about the ``Lite Rock Turkey Drop.''
   An ad for the drop includes excerpts from the original ``WKRP''
episode in which a biplane drops live domesticated turkeys at a
shopping center.
   ``There's no harm intended to anyone,'' Feeney said. ``It's a way
to benefit some people who would not be able to afford a turkey.''
   The birds don't know how to fly and, as WKRP news director Les
Nessman says in the episode, they hit ``the pavement like sacks of
wet cement.''

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has
appointed a Rock Hill, S.C., college professor as the next
chairwoman of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the
Services.
   Connie Lee, a professor of history, government and human
relations at York Technical College in Rock Hill, will assume the
post on Jan. 1. The job carries a one-year term.
   A native of Charlotte, N.C., who has served on the committee
since 1986, Lee is succeeding Jacquelyn Davis of Cambridge, Mass.
   Davis has been widely praised for her performance, including
oversight of investigations last year that spotlighted sexual
harassment in the Navy and Marine Corps.
   The committee, known by the acronym DACOWITS, was created in 1951
by then-Defense Secretary George C. Marshall to offer advice on
policies and issues relating to women. The committee consists of 35
civilians.
   According to the Pentagon, Lee holds an undergraduate degree from
the University of North Carolina; a master's degree from Winthrop
College, and a doctorate from the University of South Carolina.

   Tue Nguyen did more than nibble from the tree of
knowledge, he made a feast of it.
   Just nine years after arriving in this country with thousands of
other Vietnamese boat people, Nguyen, 26, has earned his seventh
degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a doctorate
in nuclear engineering. The school says it thinks that is a record
for MIT.
   Nguyen told the MIT public relations office that he earned
multiple degrees ``to get the most out of my time at MIT and out of
my tuition.''
   He also said he isn't a partygoer.
   The super scholar was in Burlington, Vt., this week preparing to
start a job at IBM designing technology for the manufacture of
semiconductor devices. He did not return telephone calls from The
Associated Press. But one of his fans back in Cambridge was happy to
crow about him.
   ``You're not likely to find another person like this very
often,'' said nuclear engineering professor Sidney Yip, Nguyen's
doctoral adviser.
   ``He's a very quiet guy, very laid back,'' said Yip. ``But, as
you can imagine, deep down he has a lot of will power.''
   Nguyen entered MIT in 1981. By taking up to 12 courses a semester
instead of the normal MIT student load of four, he earned his first
undergraduate degree in three years and finished up four more
bachelor's degrees in one more year. He then began his graduate work.
   He was so busy attending classes that he had difficulty doing his
homework assignments, Yip said.
   He holds bachelor's degrees in physics, in computer science and
engineering, in electrical engineering, in mathematics, and in
nuclear engineering. He got his master's in nuclear engineering in
1986 and finished work on his doctorate in nuclear engineering this
fall.
   But that was only what he learned at MIT. He also studied English
in Texas and Chinese at Harvard, the latter being the language of
his fiancee's family. Nguyen and two younger brothers left Vietnam
in 1978. His father, a retired government employee, and mother
remain in Vietnam with two other sons and a daughter.
   After three days at sea packed into a small boat with 300 other
refugees, the brothers arrived in Malaysia and spent nine months in
a refugee camp. A church group rescued them by sponsoring their
passage to Pasadena, Texas, where they moved in with relatives.
   Nguyen enrolled at a junior college in the Houston suburb, mainly
to learn English.
   At 19, he entered MIT.
   His brothers have kept busy, too. Tien Nguyen, 25, is earning a
doctorate in nuclear engineering at MIT, and Tai Nguyen, 22, is
doing graduate work at the University of California in Berkeley.
   While Nguyen has ``a great deal of scientific curiosity,'' Yip
said he worries about him.
   ``He has, in some sense, not really known the outside world. He
spent most of his time in an academic environment. So how he thrives
in the next period of his career will take some adjusting.''

   An oil company executive held captive for nearly
five months by guerrillas in Colombia says he lived a primitive
existence on the run, deprived of any contact with his family.
   Iacopo ``Jake'' Gambini, a former Texas resident who is a
petroleum engineer and major shareholder in General Pipe Services
Inc. of Bogota, Colombia, was abducted at gunpoint from his office
June 24 by five members of a left-wing guerrilla group.
   He was released last week after 138 days in captivity and weeks
of negotiations between his captors and family members, according to
his first interview published Wednesday in The Houston Post.
   The 56-year-old Gambini is one of an estimated 300 business
executives kidnapped in Colombia this year.
   ``I feel fine,'' he said. ``I feel good. The only thing I missed
was my family. Right now it just feels good to be back with my
family.''
   The identity of his captors, who were paid an undisclosed ransom,
remains a mystery.
   Gambini is staying with friends at an undisclosed location in the
United States, the Post said. He said he had not decided what to do
next, but would consider going back to Colombia.
   Gambini was at his office doing paperwork when five men armed
with pistols and rifles walked in.
   ``They never threatened me in any way,'' he said. ``They treated
me with all the courtesy and respect you could imagine. They just
said, `Come along.' I knew they meant business.''
   He was put in a car and driven deep into the countryside where he
soon lost track of his whereabouts.
   ``We moved around quite a few times,'' he recalled. ``I never
knew where we were or where we were going.''
   But his captors, he said, were friendly and considerate.
   ``I spent most of my days reading books they provided me, playing
solitaire or checkers and cards with them,'' he said.
   Gambini said he didn't know about any negotiations and wasn't
told in advance that he would be released.
   ``But I always had the feeling that I was going to be released.
And I never felt any danger.''

   The wife of Israel's Prime Minister Yitzak
Shamir returned to her native country Wednesday to thank ``the noble
Bulgarian people'' for saving 50,000 Jews in 1943 from the Holocaust.
   Addressing a symposium organized by Bulgarian officials and the
nation's tiny Jewish community, Shulamit Shamir said Israel would
never forget what Bulgaria had done.
   ``Glory to the noble Bulgarian people and may it be blessed,''
she said.
   Her tribute came as Israel is seeking to restore ties to Soviet
bloc countries which, with the exception of Romania, severed
diplomatic ties with Israel over the Middle East war in 1967.
   The two-day symposium on Bulgaria's rescue of its Jews from
deportation to Nazi death camps is the first time the effort has
been marked with an international gathering of Jewish leaders in
Bulgaria.
   Leaders of the country's 3,000-member Jewish community were
present as the symposium opened amid fanfare showing it had support
from the communist leadership.
   Bulgaria's longtime leader Todor Zhivkov is among those given
credit for saving the country's estimated 50,000 Jews from
deportation, and she said she hoped she could thank him in person.
   In her speech, she also expressed hope ``the relations between
Israel and Bulgaria will intensify to the extent of matching the
strength of the historical bond between the Bulgarian and the Jewish
peoples.''
   ``We shall remember this forever,'' she told the conference in
Bulgarian, referring to the rescue.
   The Nazis had planned to deport thousands of Bulgarian Jews to
death camps in Poland on ``barges of death'' anchored at ports on
the Danube, Mrs. Shamir said.
   ``And then a historical miracle happened,'' she said. ``Everybody
witnessed how a whole people of intellectuals and workers, peasants
and townfolk, the church, the Holy Synod, men and women, rose to
save their Jewish compatriots against the wish of the fascist
authorities at this hellish time.''
   The Bulgarians are credited with foiling the plans of their king,
Boris III, and his Nazi-allied government, to deport Bulgarian Jews
following the deportation of 11,000 Jews in the spring of 1943 from
Macedonia and Thrace to the south.
   Members of the country's parliament turned against the government
to protest deportation orders, and Zhivkov is credited with helping
to organize a demonstration of 10,000 people against the
deportations.
   The tide then started to turn against the Nazis on the Eastern
front, where the Soviets dealt Adolf Hitler's armies a decisive
defeat at Kursk, and German representatives in Bulgaria told Berlin
they could no longer pressure the Bulgarian government into carrying
out the deportations.
   After World War II ended, the communists took power and most of
Bulgaria's 50,000 Jews emigrated to Israel.
   Jewish leaders from Britain, France, East Germany, Hungary and
Italy also attended, and B'nai B'rith sent representatives from the
United States.
   Mrs. Shamir is on her second visit to Bulgaria since she left at
the age of 17 in 1941 for Palestine, leaving all her family behind.
All her relatives survived the Holocaust.

<TEXT>
   A former minister serving a sentence
of life in prison for murdering his wife was charged today in the
1983 slaying of his then-lover's husband in a case dramatized in a
TV miniseries.
   Thomas P. Bird, 38, was arraigned on murder charges 12 days after
his former lover and church secretary, Lorna Anderson Eldridge,
pleaded guilty in the shooting death of her husband, Martin K.
Anderson, along a rural highway.
   The case formed the basis of the 1987 drama ``Murder Ordained''
on CBS.
   Bird was brought to the courthouse from the state prison at
Lansing. In addition to the life sentence, Bird is serving 2{ to
seven years for an earlier, unsuccessful plot to kill Anderson.
   Earlier this month, Mrs. Eldridge, 35, pleaded guilty to a
reduced charge of second-degree murder, testifying she gave Bird a
handgun and helped him kill her husband.
   She said that she and the former Lutheran pastor devised a plan
under which she pretended to lose her keys along a highway. Her
husband got out of their van to look for the keys, and Bird shot
him, she said.
   Mrs. Eldridge awaits sentencing on the murder charge. She is
serving 5 to 18 years for an earlier unsuccessful plot on her
husband's life.
   Bird was convicted in 1985 in the death of his wife, Sandy, who
was at first believed by authorities to have been the victim of a
traffic accident.
   Mrs. Eldridge remarried before being sentenced to prison. Bird
remarried in prison.

   An outbreak of polio among children living in
coastal villages has prompted a nationwide health alert, doctors
said Wednesday.
   More than 80 cases of the crippling disease have been reported on
the Batinah coast west of the capital of Muscat, and the number is
rising.
   Health workers were ordered to vaccinate all children under the
age of 5 in the area.
   ``Around 85 percent of infants under 1 have been vaccinated
against polio,'' said Dr. Jacob Matthai, the Muscat representative
for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund.
Extra vaccines will be flown in, he added.
   The cause of the outbreak was not known. Health authorities have
speculated that vaccines had lost their potency during transport in
summer heat, which reaches 120 degrees.
   Polio, short for poliomyelitis, is an infectious viral
inflammation of nerve cells in the spinal cord that can result in
temporary or permanent paralysis.

<HEAD>US Still Won't Deal Directly With PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said today the new policy
declaration by the Palestine Liberation Organization parliament in
exile does not satisfy U.S. requirements for the opening of a
dialogue with the PLO.
   Spokesman Charles Redman said the results of the Palestine
National Council session in Algiers ``fall short'' of administration
conditions.
   He said the PNC endorsement of U.N. Security Council resolutions
to achieve a comprehensive Middle East settlement was an advance
over previous PLO statements but was ambiguous in its meaning and
its placement in the text. He refused to elaborate.
   The PNC's indirect acknowledgement of Israel's right to exist
also was insufficient, Redman said.
   ``Recognition must be clear and unambiguous,'' he said, adding
that PLO repudiation of terrorist activities against civilian
targets was a restatement of previous positions.
   ``It is still performance that counts,'' Redman said.
   The U.S. position on dealing with the PLO is that no dialogue can
take place until the PLO accepts U.N. resolutions 242 and 338,
recognizes Israel's right to exist and renounces terrorism.
   The policy has been maintained since the Ford administration.
   Despite the negative assessment, the spokesman said there were
some encouraging signs coming out of the PNC meeting.
   He said there were indications that some Palestinians ``are
trying to move the PLO in a constructive way. That's encouraging and
should continue.''
   On Tuesday, the administration rejected the PLO proclamation of
an independent state but saw as a positive sign its acceptance of
the U.N. resolutions.
   But officials noted that whatever conclusions are drawn by the
administration would not necessarily be binding on President-elect
George Bush, who takes office in nine weeks.
   On Tuesday, flatly rejected the PNC call for an independent
Palestinian state. Although the document was not explicit on this
point, the state apparently would encompass the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which have been under Israeli control since 1967.
   Redman said the status of territories under Israeli occupation
``cannot be determined by unilateral acts of either side but only
through a process of negotiations. A declaration of independent
Palestinian statehood is such a unilateral act.
   ``Our objective is a comprehensive peace,'' Redman said. ``Direct
negotiations must be at heart of the negotiating process.
Palestinian participation is required at every stage of
negotiations. All participants in the negotiations must renounce
terrorism and violence and each must agree on the accepted
international basis of U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and
338.''
   The PLO declaration renounces terrorist activities against
civilian targets but the administration insists the PLO must
foreswear all terrorist activities, among other conditions, as the
price for opening negotiations with that group.
   The administration was more ambivalent in its attitude toward the
outcome of the Algiers meeting than was Israel, whose prime
minister, Yitzhak Shamir, ruled out all negotiations with the PLO
``because they are opposed to peace with Israel.''
   Theodore Ellenoff, president of the American Jewish Committee,
said the PNC declaration does nothing to move the Arab-Israeli
dispute toward direct negotiations.
   ``I see this as a political circus, the goal of which is to
encourage international statesmen into believing there has been
movement embracing peace when actually it is nothing of the sort,''
Ellenoff said.
   But Michael Lerner, of the American Jewish magazine Tikkun, said
the PNC's acceptance of the U.N. resolutions constitute a ``historic
and welcome change'' despite the ambiguity of the statement.
   ``Israel can no longer claim that there is no one to talk to,''
he said.

   Supermarket produce counters are taking on a
special look these days, with bean sprouts, bok choy, guava and
other exotic items catching the eye of food shoppers, an Agriculture
Department economist said Wednesday.
   ``Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part
of the new up-scale image of many produce sections,'' said Catherine
Greene of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general
increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, she said. On the
average, Americans consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last
year, up 12 percent since 1972. That is a farm weight equivalent
before trimming, processing and after-harvest losses, she said.
   Greene said the per capita trend is expected to continue upward,
although there could be some year-to-year variations. For example,
she said, this year's drought probably will cause some decline from
the 1987 average.
   In any case, specialty fruits and vegetables are the rage among
many consumers, and there is no sign the demand will taper off soon.
Greene, writing in the agency's National Food Review, said there are
a number of reasons.
   ``Americans have become more health conscious, eating lots of
fruits and vegetables as part of a well-balanced diet,'' she said.
``Consequently, we want a huge selection of produce.''
   Further, Americans travel more frequently than they used to, and
many want ``foreign'' foods when they return home.
   ``Unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant
menus,'' Greene said. ``Also influencing our diets are recent
immigrants from the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia
who have brought their native foods with them.''
   A recent survey by the industry's Food Marketing Institute showed
that the number of items sold in supermarket produce departments
more than doubled to 150 between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s.
Today, more than 250 items is the norm, including new packs and
sizes of traditional fruits and vegetables, along with exotic and
specialty produce.
   Another survey conducted for a trade journal, The Packer, showed
the most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa
and bean sprouts, followed by snow peas, pearl onions, parsnips,
leeks, baby vegetables, Chinese cabbage and shallots.
   Moreover, about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard
of less widely known specialty vegetables such as Belgian endive,
bok choy, celeriac, daikon, kohlrabi, parsley root and Jerusalem
artichoke.
   The most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits, in order, were
pomegranates, persimmons, kumquats, quince and guavas.
   Additionally, at least a third of those surveyed had seen or
heard of breadfuit, passion fruit, plantains, prickly pear and red
bananas. But some fruits were nearly unkown: Asian pears,
carambolas, cherimoyas, sapotes, radiccho and rappini.
   Greene said the survey showed that consumers in the Western
United States are more likely to try specialty produce and fresh
herbs, another group of growth items. One factor is the West's large
Asian and Hispanic populations, with their interests in exotic
produce.
   Also, it was shown that consumers in the upper income brackets
eat more of the speciality fruits and vegetables.
   ``They may be better informed about the variety of produce
available and better able to afford the premium prices that
specialities sometimes command,'' Greene said.

   The Illinois Supreme Court will rule
Monday on when Chicago must hold its next mayoral election, the
court said Wednesday.
   A Cook County circuit judge ruled earlier this year that the city
must hold an election next spring to fill the two years remaining on
the term of the late Harold Washington.
   Supporters of Mayor Eugene Sawyer appealed that decision to the
Supreme Court, arguing his selection last year as acting mayor
entitles him to serve out Washington's term, which ends in 1991.
   The high court's decision will come less than a month before the
filing period opens for the spring election.
   Some major candidates have already announced for the race,
including aldermen Edward Burke, Danny Davis and Timothy Evans.
Sawyer is also expected to run, and Cook County State's Attorney
Richard Daley might also seek the job once held by his father.

   Jewish settlers in this small
hilltop town south of Jerusalem dismiss the Palestinian declaration
of independence as ``just talk,'' but right-wing leaders are calling
for annexing parts of the occupied areas.
   Hardline Likud Trade Minister Ariel Sharon said the declaration
was ``a dangerous development'' and Israel should respond by
annexing parts of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where 1.5
million Palestinians live.
   In response to the declaration, the militant Tzomet Party headed
by former Chief of staff Rafael Eytan vowed to move its headquarters
from Tel Aviv to Arab east Jerusalem, captured in 1967 from Jordan
and later annexed by Israel.
   ``Those asking for war will get it,'' a party statement said.
   But a spokesman for the far-right Tehiya party, Avi Farhan, said:
``They are declaring declarations while we are creating facts. They
are making statements in Algeria, but we are building settlements.''
   About 70,000 Israelis live in more than 130 settlements in the
occupied territories. Settler leaders have called for building 50
more in the next three years. The United States views such
settlements as obstacles to peace.
   In Efrat, a settlement of 340 families located six miles south of
Jerusalem, most people seemed only vaguely aware of the Palestine
National Council's declaration in Algeria.
   ``On, that meeting ... Well, we won this country by war and the
Bible says we were here beforehand, so I don't really understand why
the Arabs think this is their land,'' said Eran Chemsky, a high
school student sitting on a park bench next to a young woman
knitting a skull cap.
   ``It's all talk, just talk,'' said a woman riding the bus from
Jerusalem to the settlement.
   Town administrator Bob Lang, an American-born immigrant, said
settlers have become accustomed to tight security in the town and
the risks of driving along the roads into Jerusalem, where they go
to shop and work. Hundreds of Israeli travelers have been injured in
stoning attacks in the 11-month-old uprising.
   They have even gotten used to the reluctance and outright refusal
of many friends and relatives to visit, for fear Palestinians will
hurl rocks or firebombs on their cars, he said.
   ``That's the biggest problem,'' he said.
   A restaurant owner who refused to give her name said she worries
because three of her daughters travel daily to schools outside the
settlement. But she said her family cannot move because ``we have
nowhere else to go. They're throwing rocks in central Israel also.''

   The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and
utilities in October rose to the highest level in 8{ years, the
government said Wednesday in a report that stirred new concern about
inflation.
   The Federal Reserve Board said American industry used 84.0
percent of its capacity last month, up from 83.8 percent in
September. It was the largest increase since July and the highest
level since February 1980.
   Capacity use has grown or held steady for eight consecutive
months, creeping ever closer to the 85 percent threshold that
economists believe signals a pickup in inflation.
   As capacity increases, factories can have trouble producing
enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and higher prices.
   ``The hike ... is yet another sign of an increasingly fully
employed economy where substantial inflationary pressure is
building,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston Co.
   Although American businesses have spent heavily this year on new
equipment to expand production, Sinai said, ``increased capacity is
slow to come on line.''
   The rise in the operating rate last month followed a month of no
change in September, a 0.1 percentage point gain in August and a
sharp 0.7 percentage point rise in July.
   At manufacturing plants, the operating rate rose to 84.3 percent
last month, up from 84.1 percent in September and the highest since
July 1979. All of that increase was attributable to producers of
durable goods, ``big ticket'' items intended to last three or more
years.
   The durable goods rate jumped from 82.6 percent to 83.0 percent,
while the rate for non-durable goods held steady at 86.2 percent.
   The rate at motor vehicle and parts plants shot up for the third
month in a row, hitting 84.4 percent last month, up from 82.6
percent in September, the highest since 1985. However, the Federal
Reserve said the rate was still well below the 93.3 percent peak
reached in 1978.
   John Hagens, an economist with The Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., forecasting firm, said he saw ``some small sign of optimism''
in the capacity report because the growth came in industries with
more room to expand.
   ``The mix is in the right direction, away from non-durables and
toward the durables,'' he said. ``It's a high number but it's not as
high as it's been at the end of previous expansions.''
   The operating rate at utilities was 80.8 percent last month, up
from 80.6 percent in September. It hit a peak for the year in August
of 83.9 percent because of a surge in electricity use during the
summer heat wave.
   In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the
operating rate slipped from 82.4 percent in September to 81.8
percent in October. U.S. oil drilling activity has waned in response
to a decline in world oil prices.

   When President-elect George Bush takes office next year he will
face many complex foreign policy issues. His meetings in Washington
this week with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain are his first with foreign
leaders as president-elect.
   Here is an inventory compiled by Associated Press correspondents
around the world of the major foreign problems that will occupy the
new president:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WESTERN EUROPE _ In addition to defense issues, a dozen nations
will form a single market in 1992, removing many trade barriers and
perhaps posing new problems for American trade policy. Many believe
the new European trade policy will extend to politics. That could
create more diverse political positions among Western European
countries, especially in their approaches to relations with the
Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc. A Britain led by Mrs. Thatcher
seems likely to remain America's strongest backer in Europe.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NATO _ Bush will have to deal with a NATO alliance trying to
decide on upgrading its nuclear arsenal, sharing defense costs and
preparing a response to a changing Soviet Union. A relaxation of
tensions may mean a more unified Western Europe that will end U.S.
domination of NATO.
  
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOVIET UNION _ The superpowers will be trying to find ways to
break a deadlock in strategic arms reduction talks to follow the
agreement on medium-range weapons. A key aspect is whether Bush will
want to go ahead with President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' missile
defense plan, a program strongly opposed by the Kremlin.
   With President Mikhail S. Gorbachev trying to revitalize the
Soviet economy, a new U.S. administration will have to decide
whether to seek increased trade with Moscow and whether to join
other Western countries in offering credits to help the Soviet Union
modernize.
   U.S.-Soviet points of friction in Latin America, Afghanistan and
southern Africa remain on the agenda.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EASTERN EUROPE _ There are forces for change at work in the
countries that have formed a buffer between the Soviet Union and the
West since World War II. The countries are as different as Poland _
whose government is wrestling with a political opposition and a weak
economy _ and East Germany, which has a fairly strong economy and
some doubts about the need for Gorbachev-style reforms.
   But Gorbachev's drive for reform probably will generate change in
countries like Hungary and Czechoslovakia where there is
dissatisfaction with the political and economic situation. The
United States will have to respond to attempts to move toward a more
democratic political system and will have to develop policy on
economic relations with the East bloc nations.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MIDEAST _ The Arab-Israeli conflict, with the Palestinian issue
at its core, will remain the most difficult problem in this region.
There has been little progress in getting peace talks started, and
the United States will have to balance its strong ties to Israel
with attempts to maintain good relations with Arab nations.
   There is a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, but that has not led
to an improvement in U.S. relations with Iran. The issue of nine
American hostages, some of them held by groups that support Iran,
remains one of the difficult problems for the new administration.
   The United States sent a navy force to the Persian Gulf to
protect shipping from Iranian attack. But if the Aug. 20 cease-fire
holds, Bush may want to scale down the U.S. presence.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AFRICA _ The United States has been involved in relief and aid
for African countries suffering drought and famine, but the focus
has been on U.S. efforts to end South African occupation of
South-West Africa and to get 50,000 Cuban troops out of Angola.
Political decisions will have to be made on such issues as support
to South Africa, where the policy of apartheid is under attack, and
whether to continue arms supplies to Jonas Savimbi, who is waging
war against the Angolan government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ASIA _ Japan and the ``little dragons'' _ South Korea, Hong Kong,
Taiwan and Singapore _ challenge the United States on trade and the
battle for markets. Should the United States devalue the dollar to
reduce trade deficits? Should it risk alienating friends and allies
by pressing those countries hard on economic issues?
   China has opened the door to capitalist investment and Vietnam
will need encouragement to withdraw from Cambodia and to account for
Americans missing from the Vietnam War.
   Any rapprochement between the Soviet Union and China will force
Bush to calculate strategic balances in Asia, a problem complicated
by the reluctance of the Philippines to keep huge U.S. bases.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LATIN AMERICA _ The United States _ and American banks _ will
have to deal with the heavy debts of many Latin American countries,
including Mexico with a $104 billion debt.
   Problems with Mexico include drugs, Mexican resentment of U.S.
pressure on the drug issue and the continued Mexican migration to
the United States.
   Bush will have to decide what to do about the Contra rebels that
the United States supported in their battle with the Sandinista
government of Nicaragua. Will he press for more aid or seek
resettlement of the thousands of rebels based in Honduras?
   El Salvador, strongly supported by the United States, faces
increased attack by leftist guerrillas and the terminal illness of
President Jose Naoleon Duarte. The rightists could win elections in
March.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CANADA _ Bush could be confronted with a major upheaval in
U.S.-Canadian relations if a free trade agreement Reagan negotiated
with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is rejected by Canadians in
Monday's election. If it is, both sides may be wary of of entering
new trade talks. Canada and the United States are each other's
largest trading partners, with trade amounting to $150 billion a
year.
   Canadians hope a Bush administration will make progress on acid
rain, one of the most troublesome issues with the United States.

   President-elect George Bush has tapped feisty
Gov. John Sununu as his chief of staff, sources say, a signal of
change after his first two top appointments went to Reagan
administration veterans.
   Bush today attended a colorful White House ceremony welcoming
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who told reporters ``I
think we're all very fortunate in the Western world'' that Bush will
be Ronald Reagan's successor.
   Their styles will be different, she said, but ``for the first
time we shall have continuity of policies, stretching over a second
presidency ... and that gives enormous stability and confidence to
the feeling of the world.''
   Bush was meeting later today with Soviet physicist and former
prisoner of conscience Andrei Sakharov.
   Meanwhile, Bush's transition co-chairmen, Craig Fuller and Robert
Teeter, announced a raft of additions to the transition team. They
also told reporters that all transition staff members would be
required to sign an ethics form pledging them not to leak
information and to avoiding the appearance of conflicts-of-interest.
   Asked about Bush's decision to make Sununu chief of staff, Fuller
said he had raised the issue with the vice president today.
   ``Let them know (that) when I am ready to make an announcement,
they'll hear it from me,'' Fuller quoted Bush as saying. But Fuller
said he did not know whether Bush had made the decision.
   In Concord today, Sununu did not deny reports that he will become
chief of staff. At a news conference, he refused to confirm the
reports, saying any word would have to come from Bush.
   ``A request isn't a formal request until the tall, thin guy
sings,'' he said.
   The transition office released the names of key people who will
serve under Fuller and Teeter. They include Michael Farren, deputy
director; Tom Collamore and Kathleen Shanahan, liaisons with the
vice president's office; David Demarest, director of public affairs;
Janet Mullins, congressional relations; Jim Pinkerton, policy
development, and David Ryder, management.
   Other top staff positions were announced earlier. They were C.
Boyden Gray, counsel; Fred Fielding, director of the office of the
vice president-elect; Chase Untermeyer, personnel, and Sheila Tate,
spokeswoman.
   On Tuesday, after flying home from a four-day Florida vacation
with Sununu in tow, Bush met with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and announced Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady as the second
occupant of his Cabinet. He said he was not prepared to announce his
chief of staff, ``but it might be fairly soon.''
   Sources close to Bush who insisted on anonymity said the choice
of Sununu was already made, with the nod going to the 49-year-old
lame duck New Hampshire governor who helped Bush bounce back from a
defeat in the Iowa caucuses last February.
   The blunt-spoken Sununu, a onetime engineering professor, was an
indefatigable Bush campaigner, often employed as a surrogate to
attack Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, and his claims
of a ``Massachusetts miracle.''
   The Sununu choice should cheer conservatives worried that the
pivotal White House job would fall to Fuller, chief of Bush's vice
presidential staff for the last four years and regarded as more of a
moderate and pragmatist. Fuller may be in line for a Cabinet post,
possibly Transportation. He is expected to disdain working under
Sununu at the White House.
   But Fuller discounted that assessment, saying he had ``only good
working relations'' with the New Hampshire politician.
   Sununu's selection would leave Bush with a right-hand aide with
no Washington experience. Sununu's government experience consists of
six years as chief executive of one of the smallest states in the
union. A father of eight, Sununu decided against seeking a fourth
term this fall, largely for financial reasons.
   Brady, 58, former chairman of the investment banking house of
Dillon, Read & Co., joins James A. Baker III, the secretary of
state-designate, as a cornerstone member of the Bush Cabinet. Brady
took over the Treasury Department post in August when Baker quit to
run Bush's campaign.
   Bush said Brady ``will be the chief economic spokesman for my
administration.''
   ``He knows that our most important priority is to keep our
economy growing with low inflation and ... that we must resist the
policies that will impede that effort, such as raising taxes or
resorting to protection.''
   Bush added that Brady also ``knows we've got to sit down with the
Congress and hammer out a budget deficit reduction agreement and
that we have to do it soon.''
   ``I'm putting together a good team here,'' said Bush. ``You'll
see some continuity and you'll see some change.''
   Sununu flew to Florida on Monday for a private dinner with Bush
at a friend's beach home where the Bushes took their post-election
respite.
   At a dinner Tuesday night honoring Bush's wife, Barbara, for her
crusade against illiteracy, Bush joked that he had not quite been
able to escape the media on his vacation.
   ``The slogan was not, given these telephoto lens, `Read our
lips,' but `Read our hips' as we were in the surf,''' he said.
   Both Bushes were visibly moved by the salute at the National
Literacy Honors dinner, where Mrs. Bush and 18 adults who recently
learned to read received gold medallions. Opera star Sherrill
Milnes, singers Loretta Lynn and Pearl Bailey, Govs. Thomas Kean of
New Jersey and Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and the Naval Academy Glee
Club joined in the festivities.
   ``I really am overwhelmed,'' Mrs. Bush told the audience of
1,200. She said those who won their own battles with illiteracy were
``all shining examples of those thousand points of light we've been
hearing a lot about lately.''
   Bush, taking up that theme, said the entire audience of literacy
activists and corporate sponsors were all part of what he meant by
``a thousand points of light'' reaching out ``to help someone else.''
   With his wife now freed from campaigning, he said, ``Now it's
back to her true love, which is literacy,'' said Bush. ``Barbara has
helped, she will continue to help, and I want to help, too.''
   Twenty-three million American adults are said to be unable to
read above a fourth grade level.

<HEAD>State Pharmacy Board Asks For Voluntary Withdrawal Of Premier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona's Board of Pharmacy today asked R.J.
Reynolds Co. to voluntarily withdraw its ``smokeless cigarette''
from test-marketing in Phoenix and Tucson pending a determination of
whether it is a drug.
   The agency acted after the American Medical Association
petitioned the board and Missouri's Health Department, arguing the
Premier cigarette is a ``new, hazardous'' drug that should be banned
by the Food and Drug Administration.
   R.J. Reynolds attorney Jack La Sota had asked the board to delay
any action on Premier cigarettes, which are also being test-marketed
in St. Louis, until the FDA makes its own determination of the
tobacco product's classification.
   He said a decision is expected by the end of his year.
   The Premier is low in smoke and ash because the tobacco is
warmed, not burned. The cigarette also consists of a tobacco
flavoring capsule. Like conventional cigarettes, the Premier also
contains nicotine.
   For that reason, the medical association has called it a
``drug-delivery system'' that falls under the jurisdiction of the
FDA.
   Timothy J. Agan, an assistant attorney general, said the board's
enforcement options, if it were to determine that the product is a
drug, would include seeking an injunction against its sale, as the
AMA requested.
   The board would have to go to court because only the FDA has the
power to declare a product a drug and regulate it, he said.
   La Sota left immediately after the board decision and was
unavailable for comment.
   Ruth Iliff, a spokeswoman at the Arizona Cancer Center, read a
letter from the center's director, Dr. Sydney E. Salmon, calling the
effort to introduce Premier in Arizona ``an insidious attack'' on
public health.
   Salmon's letter said billing the product as a cigarette is ``an
effort to escape from just regulatory and investigational
procedures.''
   When the AMA filed its petitions, R.J. Reynolds said Premier ``is
a cigarette ... not a drug-delivery system,'' and ``substantially
reduces many of the chemical compounds that the critics of smoking
have been complaining about.''

   The best seats for the Dec. 7 gala opening of
the opera season at La Scala will sell at a record price of $770,
theater officials said Wednesday.
   The cheapest gallery sDr. Vincent P. Dole of the Rockefeller University
in New York
City was given the Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award for
discoveries concerning the physiological basis of drug addiction and
the development of methadone as an effective treatment.
   U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., who was defeated in his
bid for re-election Nov. 8, was awarded the Lasker Public Service
Award for his defense of health care programs faced with crippling
budget cuts and for establishing new programs.
   The Lasker Awards have been given for 43 years, and they have
often anticipated the awarding of Nobel Prizes. Forty-six winners of
the Lasker Medical Research awards have gone on to win Nobel Prizes.
   One of this year's winners of the Nobel Prize in medicine, Dr.
James W. Black, won a Lasker award in 1976.
   Each Lasker award winner receives or shares a $15,000 honorarium.
   Cech, a biochemist, was cited for his discovery that RNA _ once
thought to be merely a kind of genetic messenger inside cells _
could rearrange itself to change the message.
   He also found that the RNA _ or ribonucleic acid _ had a
rudimentary ability to reproduce itself, suggesting that the first
living things might have arisen ultimately from RNA.
   Earlier, Sharp had reported that only part of RNA carried genetic
instructions to govern the operation of cells. Certain segments of
RNA, called introns, are deleted from RNA as it is processed, and
the remaining segments, called exons, contain the instructions.
   Dole began his studies of addiction in the 1960s. After getting
permission to study heroin addicts outside of prison, he examined
the symptoms of withdrawal and the nature of addiction.
   Ultimately, he found that methadone, a synthetic opiate developed
in Germany during World War II, could eliminate an addict's craving
for heroin without making the addict ``high.'' That allowed addicts
to hold jobs and resume normal lives.
   Weicker was cited, in part, ``for his compassion and dedication
in the fight to eradicate disease and disability through federal
funding of medical research and public health programs.''
   Among the beneficiaries of his legislative actions were disabled
children, the mentally ill, the elderly and victims of cancer,
Alzheimer's disease, arthritis and AIDS, the Lasker Foundation said.

   A Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington was
sold Wednesday for $497,000, more than five times its top estimate.
   The painting, purchased by the Berry-Hill Gallery of New York,
had belonged to James Madison, the fourth president, and originally
hung in Madison's Virginia home, said James Miller, an auctioneer at
Sotheby's.
   The painting shows the president looking old and tired and
dressed in a dark blue coat and white neck cloth. Its authenticity
was confirmed by Marvin Sadik, an art historian who is an expert on
Washington portraits, said Miller, who conducted the auction.
   Sotheby's estimated its value at only $54,000 to $90,500 because
it was one of more than 100 portraits of the president which Stuart
painted after Washington died in 1799, Miller said.
   The British seller, who was not identified, picked it up ``rather
cheaply'' at another New York auction house, he said.
   The firm said the owner brought the portrait to London for
auction because he thought it would have a ``more unusual impact
here,'' Miller said. It was included in a sale of ``British
Paintings'' which brought nearly $14.5 million.
   Stuart, who died in 1828, was an American but worked in Britain
and Ireland as well as America, where he found fame as a portrait
artist. He was the most famous painter of Washington, who did not
like posing but sat for Stuart four times in the last three years
before his death.

   Soul singer James Brown has booked the
Augusta-Richmond County Civic Center for a Dec. 4 wrestling match
and rock concert to satisfy part of his sentence on criminal
charges, his attorney said Wednesday.
   An Aiken County, S.C., judge sentenced Brown in July on charges
of resisting arrest, carrying a pistol and drug possession in
connection with a May 18 incident near his Beech Island, S.C., home.
As part of the sentence, Brown was ordered to perform a concert to
benefit the Aiken chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police and
Helping Hands Inc., an organization aiding abused children.
   Brown's attorney, A.H. ``Buddy'' Dallas, and Civic Center Manager
Larry Rogers said they expect Brown to appear at the Dec. 4 benefit,
but he may not perform. Dallas didn't identify the artists who will

   When Nigerian writer and Nobel Prize

government, he was supposed to receive a warm welcome and be whisked
off to a luxury hotel.
   Instead, no one met him and staffers at the hotel where he was to
stay said they'd never heard of him. He finally found a room at a
less opulent hostelry.
   It wasn't supposed to happen that way, an Indian Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``We had people camping, actually, at the airport around the
clock for three days,'' said the spokesman, who under briefing rules
cannot be identified.
   But since Soyinka arrived on a flight from Frankfurt, rather than
from Bombay, the reception committee missed the playwright, novelist
and poet who was invited to be the main speaker at Monday's
celebrations honoring the centennial of the birthday of the late
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
   Soyinka won the 1986 Nobel Prize for literature.

   A security guard charged with kidnapping
and raping a lawyer on her second wedding anniversary has been
sentenced to more than 11 years in prison by a judge who said he
would have preferred a harsher penalty.
   Ramsey County District Judge Roland Faricy said Tuesday that he
was constrained in sentencing Dwayne Alexander West by an agreement
with prosecutors under which West pleaded guilty to first-degree
criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping.
   West, 24, of St. Paul was accused of abducting the woman from a
Minneapolis office building last May, stuffing her in a car trunk
and raping her repeatedly in his home.
   Police said the woman was raped at least five times in the
13-hour ordeal.
   Faricy said West continually threatened the victim's life,
putting a noose around her neck and a pillow case over her head.
   ``He tried to kill her three times'' with the pillow case, Faricy
said.
   The woman escaped only because she convinced West that she
wouldn't tell police and talked him into delivering her to safety,
Faricy said.
   ``He dropped her off on her second wedding anniversary,'' he said.
   In October, West told an emotional court hearing, ``If I
committed a crime, I should pay for it.''
   Under the 135-month sentence, West will be eligible for parole in
7{ years, Faricy said.

<TEXT>
   Two groups representing colleges and
universities on Wednesday called for an end to the ``hype'' over
school ratings based primarily on how well incoming students score
on entrance exams.
   The American Council on Education and The College Board said
undue emphasis on such rankings is causing some college-bound youth
to mistakenly think they aren't good enough for universities with
high scores and to overlook fine schools where scores are lower.
   ``Test results are only one indicator of the quality of incoming
students, and the quality of incoming students ... does not
necessarily say anything useful about the quality of what goes on in
a college or university,'' the two groups said in an open letter to
schools and education officials.
   The organizations reiterated their recommendation that schools
report incoming students' test scores in ranges, such as the highest
and lowest scores of the middle 50 percent of their freshman class,
rather than giving an average test result.
   ``The use of test score data in isolation, as a measure of
quality with which to compare or rank-list colleges, is a clear
misuse which should be curbed,'' the letter said.
   College Board President Donald M. Stewart said at a news
conference that the letter was designed to ``diffuse some of the
hype'' over college guidebooks and other reports that rank colleges
primarily on how their incoming students fare on standardized exams
such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test and the American College Test.
   ``Students should be looking at institutions because they're
exciting places and they want to be there, not because they're No. 1
on a bloody chart,'' Stewart said. `` ... The whole teaching and
learning processes are being distorted.''
   Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on Education,
said he was ``very concerned about the guidebook phenomenon.''
   He said rankings by test scores can be misleading since schools
may include different categories of students in their averages. For
example, some leave out athletes and other special-admittance
groups, he said.
   ``You can move up and down one of those lists ... almost
whimsically or accidentally,'' Atwell said.
   As colleges compete for dwindling numbers of high school
graduates, they place too much importance on getting a good ranking
and sometimes tout high scores even while ``knowing full well the
limitations'' of such lists, he added.

   The government on Wednesday
pledged to crack down on right-wing extremists after a shooting
rampage by a white supremacist left six blacks dead in downtown
Pretoria.
   Barend Strydom, the 23-year-old arrested after the shootings,
quit the national police force in February while facing misconduct
charges. At the time, Strydom said officers searching his home had
found a photograph showing him with a knife in one hand and a black
man's severed head in the other.
   Four men and two women were killed in the midafternoon shooting
spree Tuesday, and 16 people _ 15 blacks and one Asian _ were
wounded. Witnesses said the gunman laughed as he fired at his
victims with an automatic pistol from close range over a 15-minute
period before he was arrested.
   ``I could never shoot a white man,'' the gunman reportedly told
officers who drove him away as angry blacks surged around a police
van.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Strydom was a member of
the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement and claimed to be the
leader of a right-wing vigilante group called the White Wolves.
Anonymous telephone callers have claimed responsibility on behalf of
the White Wolves for recent arson and bomb attacks on offices of
anti-apartheid groups.
   Vlok and Police Commissioner Hennie De Witt said police had
started an investigation of the extreme right.
   Officers also are investigating an anonymous telephone call to a
newspaper by a man who said President P.W. Botha might be
assassinated if he announced the release of jailed African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela. The African National Congress is the
main anti-government guerrilla group in South Africa.
   Defense Minister Magnus Malan said Wednesday that stricter
security measures, including body searches, would be used at public
meetings.
   Local newspapers reported that Strydom issued a statement after
he quit the police force. In the statement he reportedly said police
had confiscated documents from his home related to the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement and had found the photograph of him holding the
severed head.
   ``The purpose of the photograph was to frame it with the heading
`ANC Beware,''' Strydom said in the statement. The head reportedly
was that of a man killed in a traffic accident.
   The Afrikaner Resistance Movement declined to comment on
Tuesday's shootings, but it issued a statement urging Botha not to
release Mandela because a ``black eruption'' might ensue.
   Botha has said Mandela's release is under consideration but has
indicated he wants some type of concession from the black leader,
who is serving a life sentence for plotting anti-government sabotage.
   The Pretoria rampage was mentioned Wednesday at a congress of
Botha's National Party when one delegate, Roger Ogies, urged the
government to ban the Afrikaner Resistance Movement.
   ``We are not believed by blacks when we say we will act against
radicals both to the left and the right,'' Ogies said.
   More than 20 black anti-apartheid organizations have been banned
this year under state-of-emergency regulations imposed by Botha in
June 1986 to end anti-government unrest in black townships.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no say in
national affairs.
   Strydom was described by witnesses as a handsome, solidly built
man with a blond moustache.
   Igshaan Hoosen, a radio shop salesman in Pretoria, said the
gunman, wearing a camouflage jacket, ``walked over to a woman,
pointed a pistol at her body and shot her in the side. Her little
boy stood there dumbstruck.''
   Laughing openly, the gunman then walked along a street in front
of the State Theater, firing more shots at point-blank range, Hoosen
said.
   He said the gunman calmly removed the empty clip from his 9mm
pistol and reloaded. He walked two more blocks, where other
witnesses said he continued to smile and fire at blacks until he was
detained.
   One of those killed was Piet Mbedzi, a 59-year-old street cleaner
with 11 children.

   Misha the Russian bear got together
with Mickey the American Mouse as 10 Soviet orphans arrived
Wednesday at the Magic Kingdom for the Walt Disney character's
massive 60th birthday party.
   The Soviets were early arrivals of more than 4,000 children and
1,000 chaperones streaming in for Friday's celebration.
   The youngsters, ages 8 to 12, are coming from 116 cities in this
country, Canada, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and Europe.
   Nearly 2,000 of the children are being flown in by Delta Air
Lines, which donated air transportation for the party, and another
2,000 are coming by bus and car from Florida cities. The groups of
from 10 to 100 kids are being accompanied by many civic leaders.
   A similar number of children and adults were invited to Mickey's
birthday activities at Disneyland in California.
   Two sisters put up for adoption in Frankfurt, West Germany, 10
years ago will be reunited at the festivities.
   Yvonne Henson, 11, who now lives in Orlando with her adoptive
parents Hans and Janet Henson, will get reacquainted with her sister
Sonja Roehm, 14, who lives in a foster home in Frankfurt. Sonja was
included in the group from Frankfurt when officials there received a
request from the Hensons.
   The Soviet Children's Fund selected 10 orphans from throughout
the country. Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner and Mickey Mouse
extended the invitation earlier this fall when they visited Moscow
for a children's film festival.
   Disney's criteria for the invitations _ that the kids be needy,
not have visited the park and preferably not have flown in an
airplane _ went unheeded by at least one community. Officials in
Toledo, Ohio, apparently never got the word and selected some
children from families of comfortable means.
   ``I'm embarrassed. I don't consider us underprivileged,'' said
Sandy Snead, mother of one of the Toledo children. ``This year we're
as overprivileged as we ever were,'' added Mrs. Snead, whose husband
is a plumber.
   Eighty of the children are from seven European cities _ Dublin
and Limerick in Ireland; Frankfurt and Munich in Germany; and
Moscow, London and Paris.
   Andrew Young of Atlanta, William Hudnut of Indianapolis and
Wilson Goode of Philadelphia are among the mayors accompanying their
delegations, plus major league baseball players Bruce Hurst of the
Boston Red Sox and Willie Randolph of the New York Yankees.
   The children will march in a birthday parade Friday, carrying
their city banners down the Magic Kingdom's Main Street, and cut
into a 1,000-foot-long birthday cake in the shape of a huge ``M.''
   The undertaking is the first of its kind for Disney. Never have
so many children from so many places descended on the two parks at
one time.
   The Disney Co. is organizing and paying for the entire event,
including hotel rooms and food.
   ``The response from the mayors and community organizations has
been amazing,'' said Disney spokesman Charlie Ridgway. ``We're
pleased. We wanted to do something just for kids, and the whole
thing just grew.''

   More than $70 million worth of fragrant
Douglas and noble firs are being cut and bundled as Oregon growers
ready themselves for the Christmas season.
   With an expected harvest of 7.2 million trees this year, Oregon
remains the nation's single largest supplier of Christmas trees.
   Prices remain about the same as last year for premium trees, with
6-foot to 7-foot Douglas firs bringing growers around $11, said
Bryan Ostlund, spokesman for the Northwest Christmas Tree
Association in Salem.
   Slower-growing noble firs bring a higher price, he said, while
retail prices are at least double what growers receive.
   California is the chief market for Oregon trees, but they also
are shipped to East Coast and even tropical destinations.
   But growers with lower-quality trees are encountering buyer
resistance because of a plentiful supply of premium, well-shaped
trees, Ostlund said.
   Others in the business say an oversupply of trees is hurting
sales.
   Steve Woodard, Lane County extension forester, said an oversupply
has been predicted for a number of years and began showing up last
year.
   ``There's way, way more trees in the ground than will ever find a
market,'' he said.
   Many smaller Christmas tree plantings will probably be left
unharvested to grow into timber, Woodard said.
   ``People get out and plant two or five acres of trees and don't
take care of them,'' he said. ``The trees are not sheared and they
won't sell. But the big growers are dead serious about the business.
They produce quality, well-shaped trees and they have their own
market contacts.''

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz presented a
black patent leather handbag Wednesday to British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher in recognition, he said, of her talent for pulling
the right statement from her bag at meetings of allied leaders.
   Shultz said that in over six years in the job he had become
accustomed to Mrs. Thatcher producing a perfect compromise statement
from her bag ``like a rabbit out of a hat'' while other leaders were
searching for the right stand to take on an alliance issues.
   ``Her role in the alliance has inspired us,'' Shultz said at a
luncheon for the visiting prime minsiter. He toasted her
``leadership, energy and special powers of persuasion.''
   Shultz pulled three statements from the bag which quoted Mrs.
Thatcher's remarks in behalf of people demonstrating for freedom, in
praise of President-elect George Bush and against terrorism.
   In reply, Mrs. Thatcher paid tribute to Shultz, who will leave in
January, as ``a true friend'' who pursued foreign policy goals with
``total integrity.''

   Women who take birth control pills face double the
usual chance of heart disease, but their increased risk goes away as
soon as they stop taking the pill, a study concludes.
   Although the link between heart trouble and current pill use is
known, experts were unsure whether this increased risk lingered
after women stopped taking the pill.
   The latest study, based on the long-running Nurses'  Harvard Medical
School, concludes that former pHealth Study
atill takers have no
more than the usual risk of heart trouble.
   The study found that pill users are 2{ times more likely than
non-users the same age to have heart attacks and strokes. However,
their risk was still extremely low.
   The adverse effects of the pill could be potentially more
important if they continue after women stop using this form of birth
control. Former users are older and are already at higher risk of
heart trouble. Even a moderate increase in this hazard could be
significant.
   ``Women who have used oral contraceptives in the past do not have
to be concerned that this will raise their risk of cardiovascular
disease,'' said Dr. Meir J. Stampfer.

<TEXT>
   Drug manufacturers and others concerned about
developing new medicines called for major reforms Wednesday in a
legal system that allows multimillion-dollar awards against drug
companies.
   Legal and medical experts told reporters the battle against AIDS
and other diseases will be hampered until manufacturers can be
better protected in lawsuits against drugs that have been approved
by federal authorities.
   ``The current climate has created strong disincentives to conduct
research and development in certain high-risk areas,'' including the
search for a cure to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS,
said Bruce J. Brennan of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association.
   The American Medical Association in June passed a resolution
saying that biomedical research was deteriorating in certain fields
because of the unavailability of product liability insurance. The
organization's 420-member House of Delegates called for broad tort
reform.
   Huge jury awards in cases involving drugs approved by the Food
and Drug Administration already have caused some drugs to be removed
from the market and limited availability of others to a single
manufactuer, Brennan said.
   ``One must ask whether it makes any sense to have FDA's decisions
second-guessed by lay juries,'' he said.
   Brennan said FDA approval of a drug should be made a strong
defense in product liability action, unless the drug manufacturer
can be shown to have committed fraud on the FDA in obtaining
approval or negligence in manufacture or distribution of the drug.
   Groups representing lawyers have argued that limiting liability
would be denying victims of dangerous drugs their rights to redress
under the legal system.
   Ross H. Weaver, technology manager for the American Medical
Association, said reasonable guidelines are needed for pain and
suffering awards which have escalated in recent years to several
million dollars.
   ``We need to compensate, but we also need to ensure that new
products stay available for those who need them,'' he said.
   George Frazza, general counsel for drug manufacturer Johnson &
Johnson, said that whenever a drug comes out relating to the
reproductive system ``lawyers are swarming all over.''
   He said most juries will make awards based on scientific
evidence, but with some drugs facing hundreds of suits across the
country, all it takes to inhibit the manufacturer is one jury ruling
in favor of the plaintiff with a large award.
   Frazza suggested that a system be set up in which courts could
take testimony from a recognized scientific panel, rather than from
experts hired by the prosecution and defense who simply contradict
each other.

   President-elect George Bush has assembled a
team of 13 people, mostly campaign workers with experience in the
Reagan adminstration, to direct his transition office, it was
announced Wednesday.
   At the top of the ladder are Craig Fuller and Robert Teeter, the
transition office's co-directors who were appointed by Bush the day
after his election Nov. 8.
   On Wednesday, Fuller and Teeter released a complete list of their
11 deputies, plus their responsibilities at the transition office.
Some had been named earlier.
   ``We're engaged in a takeover, but a friendly takeover ... and
what we are all about is trying to have a smooth and efficient
transition so we can put a Bush administration in place on or soon
after Jan. 20,'' Fuller told reporters.
   The roughly 100 people hired by the transition office are
well-situated to land big jobs in the Bush administration, but
Fuller said no promises have been made for future employment.
   The task at hand is to chose people for some 5,000 political jobs
open in 1989 as well as development policies for Bush.
   Key transition people under Fuller and Teeter are J. Michael
Farren, deputy director; Tom Collamore and Kathleen Shanahan,
liaisons with the vice president's office; David Demarest, public
affairs; Janet Mullins, congressional relations; Jim Pinkerton,
policy development; David Ryder, management; Fred Fielding, office
of vice president-elect and first lady; Chase Untermeyer, personnel;
Sheila Tate, spokeswoman, and C. Boyden Gray, transition counsel.
   Fuller, 37, Bush's chief of staff since 1985, came to Washington
after President Reagan was elected in 1980 as an assistant to the
president for Cabinet affairs. In that post, he helped coordinate
the decision-making process with the executive agencies.
   Viewed as an even-handed, efficient administrator, Fuller is a
graduate of the University of California at Los Angeles. He worked
as a public relations man at Michael K. Deaver's Los Angeles-based
firm, Deaver & Hannaford, before he came East. Fuller's wife, Karen,
works in the White House as an administrative aide.
   Fuller was mentioned as a possible White House chief of staff,
but sources say Bush has picked retiring New Hampshire Gov. John
Sununu. Fuller could land a top job in the administration.
   One of Fuller's friends, former Bush aide Frederick Khedouri,
said Fuller survived bureaucratic intrigue at the White House
because he is ``straightforward, honorable'' in his dealings with
others and ``people trust what he says.''
   Teeter, 49, served as a senior strategist and pollster in Bush's
winning presidential campaign. For more than 20 years, he was
associated with Market Opinion Research, a polling firm in Detroit,
Mich., Teeter's home state. He resigned as the firm's president in
early 1988.
   Teeter, a karate expert who lives with his wife and two children
in Ann Arbor, Mich., is considered a smooth, level-headed,
conscientious professional. He has long worked for GOP candidates,
including Reagan, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon, and helped set up
the Environmental Protection Agency. He graduated from Albion
College in Michigan.
   ``He comes across as soft-spoken, but he's intense,'' Jim Lake, a
former Reagan aide, said of Teeter.
   Directly under Fuller and Teeter is Farren, 35, a New Haven,
Conn., lawyer who was deputy undersecretary of commerce for
international trade until earlier this year.
   A volunteer in the Bush campaign, Farren was at the Republican
National Committee before he joined the Commerce Department. A
former congressional staff member, Farren graduated from Fairfield
University and has a law degree from the University of Connecticut.
   Other transition officials are:
   _Gray, 45, the counsel responsible for overseeing adherence to
ethics standards both for employees of the transition and the new
administration. An independently wealthy lawyer, Gray has worked for
Bush for eight years, serving as his legal counsel and counsellor. A
graduate of Harvard College and the University of North Carolina law
school where he was first in his class, Gray will be the next White
House counsel, Bush said.
   _Untermeyer, 42, will supervise the personnel office. Before he
joined the Bush campaign, Untermeyer was an assistant secretary of
the Navy for manpower and reserve affairs. Between 1981 and 1983, he
was Bush's executive assistant in the vice president's office.
Before coming to Washington, Untermeyer, also a Harvard graduate,
was a member of the Texas House of Representatives.
   _Fielding, Vice President-elect Dan Quayle's representative on
the transition, was the White House counsel between 1981 and 1986
before he returned to private law practice. He also worked in the
White House legal office under Presidents Nixon and Ford. A native
of Philadelphia, Fielding graduated from Gettysburg College and the
University of Virginia law school.
   _Tate, 46, was first lady Nancy Reagan's press secretary between
1981 and 1985 and was widely viewed as having helped Mrs. Reagan
repair her image tarnished by reports that she had been overzealous
in spending money on redecorating and clothes. Tate was a public
relations executive until she joined the Bush campaign. She
graduated from Duquesne University.
   _Demarest, 37, is the public affairs director, similiar to the
post he held in the campaign. Before that he was assistant secretary
of labor for public affairs and worked at the U.S. Trade
Representative's office. He graduated from Upsala College in East
Orange, N.J.
   _Collamore served in the vice president's office as staff
secretary starting in 1985 after worked as a special assistant to
the late Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. A native of
Bloomfield, Conn., he also worked on campaigns in Connecticut.
   _Shanahan has been a special assistant to the vice president for
three years. From 1982 to 1985 she was on the National Security
Council staff.
   _Mullins was deputy national political director for the Bush
campaign. From 1985-1987, she was chief of staff to Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., a job similiar to the one she once had for Sen.
Bob Packwood, R-Ore. She is a graduate of the University of
Louisville.
   _Pinkerton was a policy analyst at the White House after
graduating from Stanford University in 1979. He worked on the Reagan
campaign in 1984, then moved to the Republican National Committee
before joining Bush's campaign.
   _Ryder worked in the vice president's office as a deputy
assistant from 1985-1987. Most recently he has been director of
operations at TCOM Systems, Inc. of Washington.

<HEAD>Soviet Politburo Member Urges Freer Press</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the Soviet Union's
Politburo urged publication of ``different opinions, whether you
like them or not,'' in an interview published Wednesday by the
Communist Party daily Rude Pravo.
   Also Wednesday, the Communist Party weekly Tribuna accused
independent groups that have become increasingly active in the
Soviet bloc of seeking legalization to ``legally subvert socialism.''
   In the Rude Pravo interview, Alexander N. Yakovlev, a close
adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, appeared to criticize the
state-run media in the East bloc for failing to report more
extensively on developments in other countries.
   ``I think that our journalists should publish more actively
information about the situation in other countries. It seems to me
that there exist many reserves,'' Yakovlev said.
   ``We write about life only formally, like in a protocol...but we
can nowhere read about what is interesting everywhere, in your
country, in our country or in the countries of our neighbors,'' he
told four Czechoslovak reporters, also representing the state news
agency CTK and state Radio and Television.
   He also said, ``If you profess democracy, open information, you
should also publish different opinions, whether you like them or
not.''
   ``The one thing we must not allow are factual inaccuracies,''
Yakovlev said.
   The Tribuna article said independent groups, such as Solidarity
in Poland or the recently established League of Free Democrats in
Hungary, as well as independent groups in Czechoslovakia, sought to
create ``the bourgeois type of a plural system.''
   It was written by the editor in chief, Karel Horak.
   According to CTK, which carried excerpts, Horak made clear that
independent groups in Czechoslovakia would not be allowed to gain
the kind of political footing a number of groups have achieved in
neighboring Hungary.
   The attack came less than a week after Yakovlev told journalists
in Hungary that each country's leadership should decide for itself
the question of introducing a multiparty system.
   The Hungarian government last week approved draft legislation
that could pave the way for a multiparty system.
   Czechoslovak authorities have taken a particularly tough stand
lately on dissent, cracking down on independent groups and using
police force to break up banned rallies.
   ``From a historical point of view, opposition under Socialism can
only be anti-Socialist,'' Horak wrote.
   However, Yakovlev, in a speech at the Communist Party School in
Prague on Tuesday, defended ``Socialist pluralism.''
   ``The conflict of opinions, emotions and interests is
inevitable.'' he said.
   He indicated that communist leaders and citizens must seek to
establish a compromise or consensus.
   ``We evaluate the art of political leadership by the ability to
make sure there are no people who disagree in the main and
fundamental, no people who are rejected, separated from the society
or separating the society,'' Yakovlev said.

   Leaders of a new coalition said Wednesday they
represent more than 1 million Israeli and American Jews who oppose
ultra-Orthodox efforts to enforce strict observance of the sabbath
and change the rules of conversion.
   Founding members are the American Jewish Congress, the
Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel, three left-leaning
Israeli political parties and 18 other groups.
   ``A travesty is being played out on Judaism in Israel and around
the world,'' said Rabbi Philip Spectre, head of the coalition and
director of the Jerusalem-based Israel Movement for Progressive
Judaism.
   His 12,000-member group is Israel's equivalent of the American
Reform movement.
   In an interview, he said of the ultra-Orthodox: ``This is a breed
of Orthodox that is extremist. It threatens to push us into a
Neanderthal system.''
   Spectre told a news conference the coalition will lobby
parliament to oppose demands of the ultra-Orthodox.
   Religious parties won 18 of the 120 parliament seats in the Nov.
1 elections and probably will hold the balance of power in a
coalition government being formed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
of the right-wing Likud bloc.
   In exchange for ultra-Orthodox support, Shamir promised to
support ``Who is a Jew'' legislation under which only Orthodox
rabbis could approve conversions to Judaism. The action would take
the form of an amendment to the Law of Return, which gives Israeli
citizenship to any Jew who seeks it.
   Current law defines a Jew as a person born of a Jewish mother or
converted to Judaism. The proposed change would add ``in accordance
with Halacha,'' Jewish religious law, and thus nullify conversions
performed by Reform and Conservative rabbis who do not strictly
observe such requirements.
   Spectre said such an amendment would alienate Conservative and
Reform Jews, who are the vast majority of the 5 million in America.
   ``We are dedicated to preventing the surrender to ultra-Orthodox
blackmail,'' he said. ``We don't believe the way to glorify Judaism
is through coercive legislation. Judaism's ideas can compete on the
open market of ideas. It doesn't need coercion to back it up.''
   He said his coalition favors reforming Israel's electoral system
to limit the power of the minority religious parties.
   Yehuda Bauer, head of the Israel Association for Humanistic
Secular Judaism, said Israel's largely secular population is
threatened by the resurgence of Orthodox political power. About 75
percent of Israel's 3.5 million Jews are non-religious.
   Bauer said Orthodox parties ``want to create a backward,
Khomeini-like society by legislating religious observance,''
referring to the Iranian revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.

   Residents of a 20-block area evacuated
because of a devastating cotton fire returned home Wednesday to find
that the fire had destroyed at least 25 homes and four businesses.
   After a 30-minute tour Wednesday morning, Gov. Henry Bellmon
compared the situation to ``a scene out of a horror movie.''
   ``I can't imagine anyone thinking up a scenario like this, where
there would be a fire break out in a field of cotton modules when
the wind is blowing 60 miles per hour,'' Bellmon said.
   Eighteen people were treated for minor injuries; 400 residents of
a poor, south-side neighborhood were evacuated.
   ``Fire came and took everything,'' said Jose Cresencios Briones,
who lost his house and storage shed to the fire that began in a
storage field Tuesday and spread to this city of 23,000 in
southwestern Oklahoma.
   Briones said his property was partially insured but he didn't
know where he would work or how he would house his wife and five
children.
   Police Chief Jim Hughes said the destroyed cotton was probably
worth about $3 million. Besides the destroyed homes and businesses,
Hughes said about 100 homes were damaged by smoke. He said he had no
estimate of monetary damages.
   Several teams including Civil Defense, the Red Cross and city
workers reviewed damages Wednesday as preparation for submitting
applications for emergency aid, said city Administrator Joe Courtney.
   The cause of the fire was undetermined, Courtney said.
   Residents donated food, clothing and furniture to burned-out
residents, officials said. By early afternoon, $4,000 had been
collected; officials said the money would be spent primarily for
housing.
   Piles of clothes, canned food, toys and fresh fruit lined the
walls of the temporary relief center.
   The giant bales, or modules, were about 40 feet long, 8 feet high
and 8 feet wide, said Courtney. They were stacked in fields awaiting
processing at a cotton gin.
   The winds carried burning bits of newly harvested cotton through
the city Tuesday afternoon.
   The flames missed the trailer of Bill Tackett, but razed that of
his neighbor 15 feet away.
   ``Lucky. I'm telling you, I'm lucky,'' Tackett said. ``It could
have been worse. Because of the smoke, the firemen couldn't get
around to all of the houses.''
   ``We couldn't see a hand or foot in front of our face,'' said
firefighter Eddie Williamson. ``We had to feel from house to house.''
   On Wednesday, police and firefighters conducted a house-to-house
search of the charred area; utility workers repaired telephone lines.
   Meanwhile, firefighters watched the modules, which Civil Defense
director Dwight Dennis said Tuesday night would probably burn for
two days.
   ``It's not uncommon for a module to self-ignite under certain
situations,'' Courtney said. ``It might sit out there and smother
for two days and we might not even be aware of it.''

<HEAD>Jewish Leader Forced To Resign Over Kristallnacht Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The No. 2 official in West
Germany's Jewish community resigned Wednesday under pressure from
fellow Jewish leaders angered by his defense of a controversial
speech on the Nazi era.
   Michael Fuerst's resignation came as West Germans continue to
debate last week's speech by Parliament President Philipp Jenninger,
who also resigned.
   Heinz Galinski, chairman of the National Jewish Council,
announced after a special meeting of the 18-member Jewish leadership
that Fuerst had decided to step down because of a ``long-standing
lack of agreement between me and himself.''
   Fuerst, a lawyer in the city of Hanover, left the council meeting
after issuing the resignation. A woman who answered the telephone at
his home more than 155 miles north of Frankfurt said he was not
there. No one answered the telephone at Fuerst's office on
Wednesday, a national holiday.
   ``I hope that with this explanation the controversy has been
resolved,'' Galinski said after reading the resignation
announcement. He said the announcement had been prepared with
Fuerst's approval.
   Fuerst had been under fire, especially from the West German
Jewish community leaders, since his defense of Jenninger's Nov. 10
speech at a memorial service on the 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, the night of terror against Jews across Germany that
signaled the coming Holocaust.
   Jenninger had reminded his audience during the speech that many
Germans initially embraced Hitler's campaigns and felt that the Jews
deserved being ``put back in their place.''
   About 50 members of the German Bundestag walked out in protest of
Jenninger's remarks, and the 56-year-old member of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democratic party resigned the next day.
   Jenninger said he had been misunderstood. He told nationwide
television that ``you can't call everything by its name in Germany.''
   Galinski said after the speech he thought silence was the only
appropriate response to Jenninger's comments.
   Fuerst, however, gave his own assessment hours after the
controversial address.
   ``I welcome the fact that the parliament president described in
full clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938 ...
especially the fact that everything Hitler did was strongly
supported by the masses of all Germans,'' Fuerst told a nationally
televised panel discussion.
   Fuerst, 41, also spoke out at the time against the growing number
of calls for Jenninger's resignation. He said Monday he had received
many calls from those who approved of his defense of Jenninger.
   Galinski and other council members said Fuerst's statements
outraged most of the Jewish community.
   ``He had no chance. The overwhelming majority was against him, it
was not just us but the whole Jewish community,'' council member
Nathan Kalmanowicz of Munich said after Wednesday's meeting.
   Galinski told The Associated Press that the council members would
have taken a vote of no-confidence against Fuerst if he hadn't
stepped down voluntarily.
   The Jenninger dispute has intensified West Germany's debate over
the haunting legacy of the Third Reich.
   Many people, like Fuerst, have cautiously approved of Jenninger's
attempt to remind Germans that responsibility for the Holocaust is
shouldered by more than the Nazi leadership.
   ``The part about the people staying silent, giving approval, and
that it could happen among a majority of the Germans _ people say
that very seldom,'' said Parliament member Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher.
   Hamm-Breucher, a member of the government coalition partner Free
Democrats who started in politics in 1948, also said the speech
offered ``sharp corners and edges'' for further debate on the Nazi
era.

<HEAD>Israel Reportedly Test Fires Nuclear-Capable Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel has secretly conducted a second test of a
missile with nuclear capability that has the range to strike all the
Arab capitals, a military journal reported Wednesday.
   Jane's Defense Weekly quoted unidentified U.S. intelligence
sources as saying the Jericho-II missile was fired into the
Mediterranean in September, around the time Israel launched an
experimental satellite into space.
   The two launches did not appear related, and the firing of the
Jericho-II ``did not yield any additional information regarding the
tactical missile's current and future capabilities,'' the magazine
said.
   It said the Jericho-II was first test-fired in May 1987 and
splashed down south of the Greek island of Crete.
   The 1987 launch carried the missile 530 miles, and it was
projected to have a maximum range of 940 miles, putting it in
striking range of all the Arab capitals, Jane's said.
   It said last year's launch prompted Soviet warnings that since
the missile could reach the southern Soviet Union, Moscow might take
``defensive and political steps,'' but these measures did not
materialize.
   After the Soviet protest, Israeli officials leaked word to the
media that the missiles could not reach Soviet territory, Jane's
said.
   Israel has never confirmed persistent foreign intelligence
assessments that it has nuclear weapons or can assemble them on
short notice, and has given scant information about the Jericho
program.

   Sen. John Kerry apologized Wednesday for telling a
joke about shooting Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, saying he
regretted repeating the story he had heard in Washington.
   At a businessman's breakfast Tuesday, Kerry responded to a
question about Quayle's ability to govern by saying, ``Somebody told
me the other day that the Secret Service has orders that if George
Bush is shot, they're to shoot Quayle,'' according to newspaper
reports of the incident.
   The Massachusetts Democrat then said, ``There isn't any press
here, is there?''
   ``I shouldn't have repeated the story. It was inappropriate and I
apologize for doing so,'' Kerry said in a two-line statement
released by his aide, Larry Carpman.
   No elaboration on the statement was planned, Carpman said.
   Quayle aide Jeff Nesbit said the senator would not comment on the
remark.
   But Republican state Sen. David Locke, who co-chaired the
Bush-Quayle campaign in Massachusetts, said he was shocked by the
reported remark, saying it was irresponsible.
   ``It just seems to me to be an extraordinarily reckless comment
for a public official to make,'' he said.
   ``Whether he intended it as humor or not, of course I don't know.
But I think the way it came out was very clearly in bad taste,'' he
said.
   Kerry took questions from some of the 150 people attending the
breakfast in Lynn, just north of Boston.

<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old girl was snatched from her
bed, apparently beaten to death and then tossed over a neighbor's
fence, and a man who had lived with the girl's mother was arrested
later Wednesday, police said.
   The girl apparently died of head injuries Tuesday night or
Wednesday morning, Sgt. Chip Pippen said.
   Authorities said Huey Harold McCraw Jr., 26, was arrested at a
motel in Flowood.
   A few minutes earlier, an unidentified young woman who had been
traveling with McCraw turned herself in at a south Jackson service
station, officers said. Police did not indicate whether charges
would be filed against the woman.
   ``The investigation is not complete,'' Hinds County Coroner
Robert Martin said, adding that an autopsy was ordered to determine
the cause of death.
   Police had issued an arrest warrant for McCraw, who had lived
with the girl's mother, said Sgt. Ray Reed.
   Officers said the body of Jessica Marie Putnam was discovered
Wednesday on property near the child's home after her mother
returned from work about 1:45 a.m. and found her daughter wasn't in
her bed.
   The mother, Belinda Putnam, checked with her 15-year-old son, who
was in bed in another room, and then double-checked the house.
   The telephone rang after Putnam had been home a few mintues, and
an unidentified female caller asked her if Jessica was OK and in her
bedroom, Pippen said. The caller hung up after telling Putnam to
``check the backyard.''

<HEAD>Value Of Farm Exports Hits Four-Year High</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of U.S. agricultural exports jumped
26 percent to a four-year high of $35.2 billion in the fiscal year
that ended on Sept. 30, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Actual quantities of grain and other commodities totaled 147.5
million metric tons, up 14 percent from 129.2 million tons shipped
in 1986-87 when the value was $27.9 billion.
   The new figures were up from the previous forecast issued on Aug.
25, when the value was projected at $34 billion and the volume at
146 million tons.
   Despite the sharp gains, the year's totals were still far below
the record levels of $43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons in 1980-81
before high interest rates, foreign competition and other economic
factors triggered annual declines.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers credited the 1985 farm law's
lower price support mechanisms with making U.S. commodities more
competitive in world trade.
   Myers said a decline in food prices last month ``proves that
export increases did not occur at the expense of U.S. consumers,
despite this summer's damaging drought.''
   The USDA says higher commodity prices point to another increase
in the value of exports in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1 but
that the actual volume may decline.
   A forecast of 1989 farm exports is scheduled for release on Nov.
29.
   Wheat accounted for two-thirds of the volume increase last fiscal
year, and ``significant increases'' were reported for corn,
livestock feed and fodder, and vegetable oils.
   Overall, exports of grains and feeds accounted for more than
$12.7 billion of the total, up 37 percent.
   Other categories included: oilseeds and products, $7.7 billion,
up 19 percent; livestock products, $4.9 billion, up 24 percent;
horticultural products, $3.8 billion, up 21 percent; cotton, $2.15
billion, up 50 percent; and tobacco, $1.3 billion, up 8 percent.

   Officials from five Scandinavian
nations Wednesday adopted a program to drastically reduce the
poisonous emissions environmentalists say are choking the northern
seas.
   But the Greenpeace conservationist group charged that the plan,
which calls for a 50 percent cut in the emission of pollutants into
the Baltic and North seas by 1995, does not go far enough.
   Environment ministers and Parliament members from Norway, Sweden,
Finland, Iceland and Denmark adopted the anti-pollution plan at an
extraordinary session of the Nordic Council, an advisory body to the
five governments.
   The program also calls for reducing air pollution and oil
pollution from offshore platforms and improving environmental
protection.
   The special session of the Nordic Council was called following
alarming signs of deterioration in the marine environment in
northern waters last summer.
   Fishermen, some of whom serenaded the 87 participants at the
meeting with horns, claim the worsening pollution is killing marine
life and putting them out of business.
   In the summer, giant blooms of yellow algae killed hundreds of
tons of fish along the coasts of Norway and Sweden. In addition,
thousands of seals died from a viral epidemic whose origin was a
mystery. Vast tracts of the seabed in the Kattegat Strait, shared by
Norway, Sweden and Denmark, were found to be devoid of sea life due
to lack of oxygen.
   The pollution is caused mainly by metals from industrial wastes,
phosphorus from inadequate sewage treatment and nitrogen from
fertilizers and chemicals used in agriculture.
   ``There is reason to believe that in the Kattegat permanent
damage has been done,'' said Danish Fisheries Minister Lars
Gammelgaard.
   Gammelgaard said fish stocks in the strait had been reduced by
half between 1980 and 1987, and that many species had become extinct.
   ``You can see from one day to the next that there are greater and
greater pressures on marine fauna. And we have reached a limit where
nature cannot deal with this pressure on its own,'' said Swedish
member of Parliament Karin Soeder.
   The Nordic Council program was the first major action by all five
Nordic countries to rescue the marine environment.
   The environement ministers were instructed to draw up proposals
for reducing the emissions and to present them in February. The
measures will be reviewed at the next session of the Nordic Council
in 1990.
   But Greenpeace was not satisfied with the new plan, saying in a
statement:
   ``Fishermen and environmentalist have every reason to be angry
and disappointed about the result (of the meeting) and not least,
the suffocating political wrangle behind the scenes.''
   Critics of the plan presented the 87 participants at the Nordic
Council session with five barrels of smelly ooze from the bottom of
the Oeresund Strait.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Iran's main opposition group
said Wednesday that 12 clergymen have been executed in Tehran on
orders from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Masoud Rajavi, leader of the Iraqi-based Mujahedeen Khalq, or
People's Holy Warriors, said the executions occurred last week and
indicated ``an intensification of the regime's internal conflicts
... as it heads for disintegration and inevitable collapse.''
   Rajavi's claims could not be independently confirmed.
   The statement, sent to The Associated Press in Nicosia from the
Mujahedeen's headquarters in Baghdad, followed a U.N. report Nov. 3
that ``large numbers of prisoners, members of opposition groups''
have been executed in Iran since July.
   Dissident Iranian factions say more than 1,100 people, including
Mujahedeen activists, have been executed since the movement's
military wing, the National Liberation Army of Iran, captured two
towns in a July offensive.
   The following month, Iran and Iraq agreed to a cease-fire in
their eight-year war.
   Khomeini's acceptance of the U.S.sponsored cease-fire is
understood to have been opposed by hardliners in the fundamentalist
Tehran hierarchy. Rajavi claimed it has internal divisions in Tehran
between various factions jockeying for power after Khomeini dies.
   The 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch has been reported to be
ailing.
   Despite statements by Iranian leaders that the hierarchy is
united, Rajavi said the executions showed that Khomeini ``has found
no other resort but killing and intimidation.''
   He said Khomeini and Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani _ the
most powerful figure after the ayatollah _ ``want to make it
abundantly clear to the other mullahs that the consequence of
non-conformity or dissent, even within the regime, is death.''
   The statement identified only three of the executed clerics. It
gave their names as Omid Najafababi, Hussein Arab and Sultani and
said they were executed ``on Khomeini's personal order.''
   Other Iranian dissident sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the executed clerics were associates of Ayatollah
Hussein Ali Montazeri, Khomeini's designated successor. They said
they had no details about why the clerics were reportedly executed.
   Montazeri and Rafsanjani have been at odds in the past, although
recent indications were that they had set aside their differences
while Iran sought to rebuild its military machine and carry out
post-war reconstruction.
   Montazeri, whose succession to Khomeini has been opposed by other
Iranian leaders, was tainted in 1986 by the arrest of Mehdi Hashemi,
brother of Montazeri's son-in-law and a former close associate.
   His arrest was ordered by Rafsanjani after Hashemi exposed
Rafsanjani's clandestine contacts with the United States in the
secret deal to trade arms for hostages held in Lebanon.
   Hashemi, a hard-line cleric who was believed linked to Iranian
terrorist operations abroad, was convicted of treason and murder and
executed last year.
   That was seen as a coup for Rafsanjani and a demonstration of his
ascendancy in Tehran.

   Sudanese rebels and political
leaders met Wednesday to finish drafting an agreement to end a
5{-year-old civil war in southern Sudan.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Front and the Democratic
Unionist Party were attending the conference in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia's capital.
   Col. John Garang, a rebel leader, and Mohammed Osman Mirghani,
the party general secretary, were first scheduled to sign a peace
agreement Monday. However, the signing was postponed to Tuesday and
then to Wednesday. There was no explanation.
   The Democratic Unionist Party is the second-largest political
party in Sudan and is a partner with Prime Minister Sadiq Mahdi's
Umma party in the Khartoum government.
   The five-point peace agreement calls for suspension of Islamic
law and the state of emergency in Sudan. It also calls for ending
defense pacts between Sudan and other countries and for convening a
constitutional conference attended by all political parties.
   In addition, Garang agreed to allow relief to reach starving war
refugees in Sudan.
   Mansour Khaled, a former foreign minister in the government of
ousted President Gaafar Nimeiri and now a rebel supporter, described
the Addis Ababa meeting as ``a final and formal conference.''
   Khaled said Mahdi would accept an agreement between the rebels
and the minority party because his majority Umma party is committed
to the so-called Koka Dam Declaration.
   Sudanese political parties, including rebel leaders, agreed to a
united and secular Sudan at a 1986 meeting in Koka, a resort town 60
miles south of Addis Ababa.
   Mahdi has given his blessings to the meeting and on Nov. 10 said
he had given Mirghani ideas to present to Garang. He did not
elaborate.
   Garang organized the Sudan People's Liberation Army in early 1983
and began his fight for southern autonomy and political, economic
and administrative reforms. Then-President Nimeiri's proclamation of
Islamic law exacerbated the war six months later.
   The rebels claim to control 95 percent of the southern
countryside and small towns.
   Relief workers say the accumulated effects of more than five
years of war have brought widespread famine to much of southern
Sudan this year. They estimate that starvation has killed more than
250,000 people.
   One-third of southern Sudan's civilian population of 6 million
has fled in search of a haven in northern Sudan and neighboring
Ethiopia.

   The Air Force on Wednesday accepted
the first Delta 2 rocket and dedicated the pad from which the
powerful new space booster will be launched.
   ``Today marks another crucial step in achieving assured access to
space for our national security payloads,'' said Lt. Gen. Donald L.
Cromer, commander of ther Air Force Space Division.
   Cromer said the first Delta 2, scheduled for launch in December,
will carry a pair of navigation satellites which will have a
``revolutionary impact on worldwide navigation and on military
planning and force deployment.''
   The Delta 2 is a more powerful version of the Delta 1 rocket
which for 28 years has been a workhorse space booster for NASA and
the Defense Department, orbiting 170 satellites.
   The launch pad dedicated Wednesday is an old Delta 1 pad
renovated to handle the new, larger rocket.
   John Yardley, president of McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co.,
said the Air Force has ordered 14 Delta 2s, with an option for six
more, while the company has orders for eight of the vehicles for the
launch of communications satellites and other commercial payloads.

<TEXT>
   Thursday night on CBS it will suddenly become
mid-day on a Friday _ Nov. 22, 1963. The black-and-white soap opera
``As the World Turns'' will be on.
   The soap opera is interrupted by Walter Cronkite intoning, ``Here
is a bulletin from CBS News.''
   The rarely scene footage is in the CBS' documentary ``Four Days
in November: The Assassination of John F. Kennedy,'' marking the
25th anniversary of the death of the president.
   The documentary consists of little more than edited footage from
the 56 hours that CBS was on the air covering the assassination, the
shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy funeral.
   The vintage film has an eloquence of its own that CBS anchor Dan
Rather and executive producer Perry Wolff wisely leave alone. The
documentary allows viewers their own memories, with a minimum of
present-day intrusion.
   ``We opened a time capsule, that's all we did,'' said Wolff who
joined Rather and the other producers of the program at a screening
for TV critics.
   ``For once at least, we didn't do too much,'' said Rather, who
only appears on camera to set up the next sequence.
   ``Our purpose is not to make commentary on the past, but to bring
it back.''
   Keeping present-day commentary to a minimum apparently also
allowed the network to avoid another Rather-Cronkite wrangle. Rather
gets the spotlight as anchor of the broadcast, but Cronkite is the
star of the archival footage.
   Cronkite declined to comment on his lack of participation in the
documentary, calling it a ``judgment'' call.
   The only footage in the documentary that was not part of CBS'
coverage at the time is the famous Zapruder 8mm film of the
assassination. CBS did not have rights to the film in 1963. Now,
however, the film is rented out by Abraham Zapruder's family.
   After the initial bulletin, CBS returned briefly to regular
programming _ a commercial for Nescafe _ then re-interrupted.
Cronkite appeared on camera in the newsroom. There were live
pictures from the Dallas Trade Mart, the site of a luncheon that was
to have been the next stop on Kennedy's agenda.
   Eddie Barker of KRLD, CBS' local affiliate, reported from the
Trade Mart, passing along unconfirmed reports that Kennedy was dead.
An unheralded cameraman zeroed in on a weeping black waiter; later
on workers sadly removing the presidential seal from the podium.
   Rather later confirmed the report of Kennedy's death, working the
story from the station by phone. Barker had gotten confirmation from
a doctor on the Parkland Hospital staff. Rather confirmed with a
priest and a doctor who were in the emergency room when the
president died. Cronkite reported Rather's confirmation, but the
official announcement did not come for another 17 minutes.
   ``It was a very long 17 minutes,'' Rather recalled.
   Cronkite is handed a piece of wire copy. ``From Dallas, Texas,
the flash, apparently official,'' he said solemnly. ``President
Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time. Two o'clock Eastern
Standard Time.'' He takes off his glasses and looks at the clock.
``Some 38 minutes ago.'' Cronkite's voice cracks, and he has to take
a moment to collect himself before continuing.
   In the documentary, Rather explains that viewers may see water
marks on some of the footage. Television had never covered such an
event, and because most news cameras used film instead of videotape,
technicians were developing film as fast as they could and putting
it on the air still wet.
   Also included is rarely seen footage of accussed assassin Oswald
answering reporters' questions as police escort him through the
police station. There's also the now-famous footage of Jack Ruby
stepping out of a crowd and shooting Oswald to death at point-blank
range.
   The last part of the documentary is the state funeral. It was
television news coverage at its best, as announcers let the tragic
spectacle unfold with very little comment.
   According to Wolff, viewers are lucky to see the CBS footage at
all. He said the film was deteriorating and probably would not have
lasted another five years.
   ``Even if the broadcast doesn't work, it's been preserved for one
more generation,'' Wolff said. ``This time capsule is a national
treasure.''

<HEAD>IRS Sets Disclosure Standards For Tax-Exempt Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service served formal
notice Wednesday that non-charitable, tax-exempt organizations are
required to fully disclose to potential donors that their
contributions are not tax-deductible.
   The agency also issued detailed guidelines to organizations that
offer to sell routine services that are available free or for a
nominal charge from the federal government. This requirement was
prompted by advertisements offering to sell workers a summary of
their earned Social Security benefits, even though that information
is available free from the Social Security Administration.
   The guidelines require such solicitations to state expressly if
the information can be obtained from the government for $2.50 or
less.
   The restriction applies only if the information to be provided
affects only the specific individual solicited. It exempts, for
example, solicitations to provide copies of federal agency
newsletters or material on pending legislation.
   The restriction and the requirement that non-charitable
organizations fully disclose that donations are not deductible as
charitable contributions were required by Congress in a 1987 law.
The latter provision affects such groups as political, farm and
labor organizations whose annual gross receipts normally exceed
$100,000.
   Any advertisement or other solicitation must include a statement
similar to: ``Contributions or gifts to (name of organization) are
not tax deductible.''
   If the solicitation is in a television ad, for example, the
statement must appear ``in close proximity to the request for
contributions,'' if oral, or, if written, must appear on the screen
in large easily readable type for at least five seconds.

   The government arrested 23 people
in a series of fires at government buildings in June, police said
Wednesday.
   The 23 are being held under the Internal Security Act, which
enables the government to hold them without trial indefinitely,
police said.
   The men, all Malays ranging from age 25 to 62, were arrested
between mid-October and mid-November. Authorities released their
names but gave no indication as to their backgrounds or a possible
motive for the fires.
   However, the deputy president of the opposition Pan-Malaysian
Islamic Party, Ustaz Fadil Nor, told reporters that at least two of
those arrested were Moslem priests who were members of the party.
   Jaffar Abdul, deputy inspector of police, said the men were
arrested in connection with fires June 5 at the Kedah State Regional
Development Authority and the District Government Office in Sik, 210
miles north of here in Kedah state adjoining the Thai border.
   During the arrests, six revolvers, three hand grenades, a large
quantity of ammunition of various types, several types of explosive
devices were seized, Jaffar said.
   Police are investigating what action should be taken against the
men, including filing charges in court, he said.
   In Malaysia all guns, ammunition, explosives and explosive
devices have to be licensed. Anyone violating that law could be
sentenced to death if charged and convicted under the Internal
Security Act.
   The act allows authorities to hold detainees withput trial for 60
days. The Home Affairs Minster can then sign an order holding them
for a two-year period, to be followed by more indefinite detentions
if necessary.
   The group arrest announced Wednesday was the largest since 106
people were arrested under the act in October and November of last
year. Since January they have been released in groups and now only
18 remain in jail, including parliament opposition leader Lim Kit
Siang from the opposition Democratic Action Party.
   Security officials say 80 people are being held under the
Internal Security Act. When Mahathir Mohamad became prime minister
in July 1981, 500 were being held.
   The act is a remnant of British colonial rule and Malaysia, which
won independence in 1957, has continued to use it for what it calls
safeguarding national security.

   The husband of a Nigerian diplomat has
been charged with smuggling marijuana into Zimbabwe and bribing a
customs official, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The trial of Oluromiti Joseph, 28, who is married to a Nigerian
High Commission diplomat, opened in Harare on Tuesday, The Herald
reported.
   Joseph, who pleaded innocent, faces a maximum sentence of 12
years in prison if convicted.
   The state claims Joseph and a Nigerian friend smuggled 38 pounds
of marijuana into Harare airport in suitcases with false bottoms.
Joseph allegedly offered a $300 bribe to a customs officer who found
the drugs, the newspaper said.
   Joseph's friend, Lookman Abioudun, was convicted of smuggling and
sentenced to three years in prison earlier this month.

<HEAD>Study Says No Changes Needed to Equalize Social Security Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress should resist demands by so-called
notch babies to raise Social Security benefits for people born
between 1917 and 1921, concludes a report released Wednesday by the
National Academy of Social Insurance.
   The report by a panel of non-partisan experts said benefits to
some people born before 1917 are higher than Congress intended,
sometimes as much as $200 a month more than people with similar work
histories born a few days later.
   But the experts said it is not feasible, politically or
economically, to reduce their benefits or raise those of everyone
born later. ``Therefore, the panel recommends no change in present
law...'' the report concludes.
   The notch report was sought last March by Sens. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan and Bob Dole, chairman and senior GOP member of the Senate
Finance Committee's Social Security subcommittee.
   The notch, or discrepancy in benefits, arose when Congress
adopted a new formula meant to keep rising Social Security benefits
at a constant percentage of a person's average pre-retirement
earnings.
   However, people born before 1917 were allowed to use the old,
over-generous method of calculation. The result: a benefit rate that
peaked in 1981 at 56 percent of average earnings, about 15
percentage points higher than what Congress had intended.
   Robert Myers, chairman of the study panel and formerly executive
director of the National Commission on Social Security Reform, said
there are probably about 1 million notch babies feeling
``substantial impact'' from the situation.
   ``It isn't fair,'' Myers acknowledged. But he and others on the
study panel said those born after 1917 are receiving the benefits
Congress intended.
   The report said any inequity is due to some people getting too
much _ not others getting too little. ``It would be unwise to extend
this over-generous treatment to additional persons,'' the report
said. Furthermore, it said, there is no practical way to correct the
problem.
   Eliminating the notch ``would require reducing benefits for those
already receiving them,'' the report said. ``Conversely, increasing
the benefits of those born in the notch years would, in turn, create
new relative notches affecting those born in later years.''
   Myers said it would cost up to $300 billion to equalize
everyone's benefits. As far as reducing the windfall, he said it
would be very difficult and expensive to find the individuals who
received it _ not to mention that ``from a practical standpoint,
Congress would be quite loath'' to take away benefits from people
already receiving them.
   Myers said there are many misconceptions about the notch
situation and criticized some grass-roots notch groups for
disseminating erroneous information.
   The report says, for example, that some notch babies incorrectly
believe they are at a disadvantage compared to people born both
before and after them. Computation procedures are, ``if anything,
generally to the advantage of those born prior to 1922 when benefits
relative to prior earnings are considered,'' it said.
   The National Academy of Social Insurance describes itself as a
non-partisan, non-profit center for research and education on Social
Security and related programs. Its board of advisers includes
Moynihan and Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland
and Alexander Trowbridge, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers.

   National Guardsmen helped keep order Wednesday
after up to 10 tornadoes churned through Arkansas, killing six
people, damaging scores of homes and businesses and temporarily
knocking out power to 16,000 customers.
   The twisters destroyed or damaged 240 homes and mobile homes and
eight businesses, said Gary Talley, spokesman for the state Office
of Emergency Services. No monetary estimate of the damage was
available Wednesday.
   Seven counties were declared disaster areas by Gov. Bill Clinton,
who set aside $350,000 in state emergency funds.
   At least 49 tornadoes touched down in Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas,
Illinois and Iowa on Tuesday night. A seventh person was killed in
southwest Missouri. The same storm system left three people dead in
road accidents in Colorado and was blamed for the electrocution
death of a woman in Illinois.
   The National Weather Service said the storms were caused by a
cold front colliding with warm, moist air.
   ``We saw it coming, but there was nothing we could do,'' said
Police Chief Darnell Scott of the central Arkansas town of Lonoke,
where two people were killed and about 30 houses were reported
heavily damaged.
   At the height of the storm, 16,000 customers of Arkansas Power &
Light Co. lost power for different periods, said AP&L spokesman
Jerol Garrison. By Wednesday morning, only about 1,000 customers
still had no power, he said.
   About three dozen National Guardsmen were called out for several
hours Wednesday morning to look for survivors and keep non-residents
away from homes in the Scott area in Pulaski County. A second group
of guardsmen performed similar duties in Van Buren County.
   Three of the tornado victims, a couple and their infant son, died
when their mobile home in Scott was battered by the last of the
tornadoes to hit the state, authorities said. They were identified
as Randall Dycus, 24, Kristi Dycus, 22, and their son, Waylon, about
1.
   Robert W. McCain and Juanita A. McCain, both 62, died when high
winds overturned their van on Interstate 40 near Lonoke, and Louis
Breckel, 68, was killed in Van Buren County when the storm destroyed
his home, authorities said.
   Breckel lived across the street from the new Southside High
School gymnasium, which was destroyed, Sheriff Kenny Lee said.
   ``Luckily, most of those people where the homes were completely
destroyed were all out at a high school basketball game'' in another
county, Lee said.
   William Brown, a 25-year resident of Scott, appeared resigned
Wednesday as he viewed the twisted remains of his home, which the
tornado lifted off its slab.
   ``We'll rebuild,'' Brown said, as he waited for his insurance
agent. ``Sure, we'll rebuild. This is home.''
   Next to the house sat his pickup truck, its windows blown out and
a stick almost an inch in diameter imbedded in the dashboard.
   The trees in the area, coated with the swirling fiberglass
insulation sucked into the storm's path, looked as if they were
blooming with pink cotton, and broken glass, uprooted trees and
loose boards were strewn everywhere. Two boats, hoisted by high
winds from a nearby bayou, sat 20 yards from the shoreline.
   A twister in Garland County demolished the Lake Hamilton Fire
Department, along with a half-dozen mobile homes and a barn, and 14
mobile homes were destroyed and the roofs of several residences were
damaged in Hot Spring County, said state Trooper Janet Welch.
   In Johnson County, said Sheriff Eddie King, ``We had several
homes demolished, six to 10 homes homes destroyed _ roofs blown out,
trailer homes flipped over. Trees were just twisted up, thrown in
people's yards. Cars were picked up _ one was thrown up into the
tree.''

   This year's drought-reduced grain and soybean
harvests will mean sharply higher feed costs for livestock producers
in the coming year, with some items costing almost half again as
much, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Drought and hot weather reduced total feed grain production by 34
percent this year. That was the smallest crop since 1983.
   ``The tighter supply for all feeds this year will result in
significantly increased feed costs,'' the department's Economic
Research Service said.
   Prices of feed grains, mostly corn, are expected to average 25
percent to 45 percent above last year's weighted average of $76.70
per ton, the agency said in its new outlook report.
   Soybean meal prices may average $235 to $275 per ton, compared
with $222 in 1987-88.

   Mickey Mouse celebrated his 60th birthday two
days early Wednesday with balloons, a four-tiered cake and a jazz
band party, where his tailless friends disclosed he's a contented
bachelor and a closet Republican.
   ``I think he's been a Republican,'' said Roy Disney, who ought to
know.
   No sooner had Walt Disney's nephew uttered the R-word than
Michael Eisner, board chairman of Disney's $3 billion corporate
empire, grabbed the microphone and said, ``No, he's non-partisan.''
   But the elephant was out of the bag, and Mickey didn't deny it.
Fat, sleek and eternally grinning, he merely bowed and waved a
white-gloved hand at his adoring fans at the Smithsonian
Institution's National Museum of American History.
   It was 60 years ago Friday, on Nov. 18, 1928, at the Colony
Theater in New York City, that Mickey made his film debut in
``Steamboat Willie,'' the first synchronized sound cartoon in black
and white.
   To mark the anniversary, museum director Roger Kennedy was given
six original pencil drawings of Mickey Mouse sketched by Disney's
chief animator, Ub Iwerks, for ``Steamboat Willie,'' along with a
replica of an animation cel, or celluloid painting, used in the film.
   Mickey also gave Kennedy a happy birthday T-shirt and a hug.
   The drawings and cel were put on display in the museum's
collection of pop culture memorabilia, which also includes Archie
Bunker's armchair, John Philip Sousa's baton and Dorothy's ruby red
slippers.
   Kennedy said Mickey Mouse was ``a terribly important figure in
American mythology,'' whose enormous worldwide popularity ``scared
all those Wall Streeters'' who once rejected Disney's pleas for
financial backing.
   Walt Disney, who died a multimillionaire in 1966, always said
Mickey captivated the public because ``he's just a nice little
guy,'' noted Roy Disney, a former Disney filmmaker who is corporate
vice chairman.
   Mickey didn't seem to mind that Minnie, his ever-faithful
girlfriend, had missed the party, even though tiny figures of the
two cartoon mice topped the birthday cake.
   Does Mickey ever entertain thoughts of getting married and
raising a family?
   ``He's only dating these days,'' Eisner said. ``At 60, it's too
late for little mice.''

<HEAD>Titanic Discoverers to Hold Undersea Classroom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discoverers of the sunken Titanic
announced a venture Wednesday designed to bring undersea exploration
of a Roman shipwreck to thousands of students across the country via
live television.
   Robert Ballard, who led the team that found the Titanic in 1985,
said students, linked by satellite to at least nine science museums
in the United States and Canada, will be able to communicate with
explorers directing an unmanned mobile camera as it combs the
Mediterranean Sea floor.
   While the $6 million, privately funded project involves several
advances in technology, Ballard said its main purpose is to excite
students about science.
   ``We really have a crisis of education in the United States,''
Ballard said at a news conference at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. In recent years, he said, science has failed to provide
young, impressionable students with attractive role models.
   Instead, he said, the role models are ``that scientists are
nerds, or as my kids would say, dweebs, and dweebs sit at terminals
and are dropouts from society.''
   In the ``Jason Project,'' named after the underwater robot that
helped explore the Titanic, high-quality television cable will be
connected to a ship thousands of feet above on the sea surface. For
14 days next May, the ship and its 50-member crew, including six
high school students, will control the movements of the robot and
send back satellite images from two underwater locations.
   In addition, the National Georgraphic Society plans to produce
and broadcast a later special on the expedition.
   The live broadcasts will be transmitted via the Turner
Broadcasting System in Atlanta and Electronic Data Systems Corp. in
Atlanta to the nine science museums in Boston, Chicago, Memphis,
Washington, D.C., Dallas, Philadelphia, Rochester, N.Y., Charlotte,
N.C., and Victoria, British Columbia. The shipboard crew will
broadcast six programs a day or 84 40-minute programs in all that
will be seen by a total of roughly 200,000 students.
   Instead of simply sitting and watching the programs, the students
will have before them a multiscreen control room that replicates the
control center on the ship. Students will be able to ask questions
of the crew and in some cases take over the controls of Jason,
Ballard said.
   Ballard called the concept ``telepresence.''
   The plan is for Jason to explore an undersea volcano field off
the west coast of Italy where minor eruptions, emissions of molten
minerals and an abundance of wildlife will be visible. At another
western Mediterranean site, which Ballard declined to disclose,
Jason will send back pictures of a vast debris field believed to be
the remains of several Roman shipwrecks from the second century, A.D.
   Frank Ireton of the National Science Teachers Association, which
is helping train science teachers who will bring their classes to
the programs, said, ``It's a tremendous interest-generator. If we
have 200,000 students and we interest 10 percent of them in science,
my gosh, that's a tremendous benefit.''

   Teen-agers challenged
Israel's authority with songs, rocks and flaming tires Wednesday
despite army efforts to stop celebrations of the Palestinian
declaration of independence.
   Soldiers wounded eight Palestinians in Gaza City and the town of
Khan Yunis, said hospital officials in the Gaza Strip. Those shot
were protesters and violators of a military curfew that confined
Gaza's 650,000 residents to their homes for a sixth day.
   In the occupied West Bank, curfews and travel bans were imposed
on about 250,000 Palestinians. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army chief of
staff, said the army ``will keep as many troops in the area as is
needed. We will continue to keep the quiet by keeping people under
curfew as necessary.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said on state television: ``I
believe that the events of the last several days can become a
turning point leading to a significant decrease in violence. ... We
can undertake all the legally allowed steps.''
   Rabin said security actions have had a cumulative effect,
``making it more and more difficult for the residents to conduct
violent actions. ... I believe that in three to six months we shall
bring about a substantial quiet.''
   A 25-year-old man wounded by soldiers three days ago in the Gaza
Strip town of Rafah died Wednesday, raising to 313 the number of
Palestinians killed since the uprising against Israeli occupation
began Dec. 8, 1987. Eleven Israelis also have been killed.
   Palestinians have been celebrating the independence declaration
since it was issued Tuesday in Algiers by the Palestine National
Council, which acts as the legislature of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Young men danced in the streets of Bethlehem in the West Bank and
sang the Palestinian anthem ``My Homeland, My Homeland.'' Masked
youths carrying a sign saying ``PLO, Israel No'' marched on even
after soldiers fired over their heads.
   Soldiers later were seen breaking into houses and ordering
residents to clear rocks from the streets. Using loudspeakers, they
ordered women to bring pails of water to put out fires.
   In Jerusalem, about 40 students from a Jewish girls' school in
the West Bank settlement of Ofra protested the independence
declaration, chanting and reading a statement against ``Palestinians
carrying on the ways of the Nazis, murderers of women and children.''
   Well-known Israeli writers Amos Kenaan and Dan Ben-Amotz
published an advertisement in the daily Hadashot congratulating
Palestinians on the declaration.
   ``We recognize your government and appeal to the Israeli
government to recognize the government of Palestine in exile and to
immediately launch negotiations with it,'' they said.
   The latest victim, identified as Tareq Abu Samhdaneh, died of a
bullet wound to the head, hospital officials said. Arab reporters
said he was shot the same day he was released from prison, where he
had been held without trial for four months.
   In Gaza Wednesday evening, firecrackers echoed through darkened
streets that had been kept quiet during the day by hundreds of
troops patrolling in trucks covered with plastic sheets as
protection against stone-throwers.
   During a morning tour by journalists under army escort, Gaza
youths dashed from an alley to throw stones at reporters' cars. One
car was hit, but no one was hurt.
   Reporters saw soldiers bang on doors of one deserted street where
a tire burned, hauling out a balding, middle-aged man in a white
robe to douse the flames and remove debris from the road.
   In the West Bank, the army declared Ramallah a closed military
area, preventing anyone from entering or leaving the city of 40,000.
Curfews were in effect in the towns of Tulkarem, Qalqilya, Nura
Shams and Shuweika, home to about 85,000 people. Nablus, the largest
West Bank city, also was reported to be under curfew.
   Troops carried out raids in several West Bank areas, a military
spokeswoman said. She said arrests were made but declined to give a
number. Israel radio said about 100 people were rounded up in the
city of Hebron and in several villages.

<HEAD>Emperor's Energy Waning, Palace Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's energy is waning and doctors are
trying to keep the condition of the 77-pound monarch stable rather
than improving it, palace officials said Wednesday.
   The world's longest-reigning monarch has been bedridden since
Sept. 19, when he started bleeding internally.
   ``Compared to before, his energy has somewhat declined'' on
Wednesday, said Kenji Maeda, spokesman for the Imperial Household
Agency. But ``there has been no particular change,'' he added.
   On Wednesday afternoon, the emperor had a fever of 100.4 degrees,
up from 98.8 in the morning. His normal temperature is about 95.9.
   Maeda said doctors were more concerned with maintaining rather
than improving the emperor's condition.
   He said the emperor's showed no signs of new bleeding and doctors
did not plan to give him further blood transfusions. Hirohito has
received 42 pints of blood _ more than three times the amount
circulating in his body.
   On Wednesday, the emperor received visits from the families of
his two sons, Crown Prince Akihito and Prince Hitachi, but they
talked very little, Maeda said. Hirohito sleeps most of the time and

   Dozens of Palestinian Americans and Arab
diplomats on Wednesday celebrated the declaration of a Palestinian
state with balloons, a birthday cake and wild cheering.
   Under a banner reading ``Happy Birthday Palestine,'' speakers
extolled this week's decision by the Palestine National Council to
declare an independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The PNC, which is the legislative branch of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, also adopted a resolution which implicitly
accepts Israel's right to exist, renounces terrorism and calls for
Middle East peace talks under international auspices.
   Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar Bin-Sultan said the PNC program
``is a major breakthrough toward peace. ... It's a great opportunity
for the United States.''
   Also present at the celebration were the ambassadors of Jordan,
Egypt, Qatar, Morocco, Yemen, as well as diplomats from Kuwait,
Djibouti, Somalia and India. So far, 23 countries have recognized
the declaration.
   The United States has rejected the declaration of a Palestinian
state, calling it a unilateral action that does not advance the
cause of peace.
   The State Department has also said the PNC program does not meet
the U.S. requirements for dialogue with the PLO because it fails to
explicitly recognize Israel.
   The declaration of a state does not have any practical effect in
the near term, but it has served to boost morale among Palestinians
in the occupied territories who have been staging an insurrection
against the 20-year Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Wednesday's event, organized by the American Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, began with a moment of silence for
the 300 Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli troops over the
past 11 months. ADC advocates civil rights for Americans of Arab
descent.
   Participants then sang the Palestinian anthem, which speaks about
a return to the homeland, followed by the popular Beatles' refrain
``Give Peace a Chance.''
   A birthday cake was then wheeled out to the sound of wild
cheering and yululating.
   Abdeen Jabara, President of the ADC, said the PNC decision
``should be the electric shock to break the cycle of violence and
pain'' for Palestinians. ``The American administration must seize
this window of opportunity,'' he added.

   Saying ``it isn't over until the tall, thin
guy sings,'' Gov. John Sununu on Wednesday would not confirm that
President-elect George Bush has picked him to be White House chief
of staff.
   But given several opportunities during a Statehouse news
conference, Sununu did not deny the report either.
   ``Until the vice president decides yes or no _ and he certainly
could decide no in the interim _ I don't really think it's
appropriate for me to comment,'' Sununu said when asked if he has
accepted the chief of staff job.
   ``It isn't over until the tall thin guy sings,'' he said of the
lanky vice president.
   But sources close to Bush who insisted on anonymity said Bush
definitely has chosen Sununu as chief of staff.
   Sununu is seen as a major political creditor of Bush's. He helped
the vice president rebound from defeat in the Iowa caucuses last
February with a critical win in New Hampshire's leadoff primary.
   Sununu, 49, subsequently decided not to seek a record fourth term
as governor and was one of Bush's national co-chairmen for the
general election campaign, traveling widely and appearing on
television programs to attack the Democratic nominee, Michael
Dukakis, governor of neighboring Massachusetts.
   Sununu dined privately with Bush in Florida on Monday evening and
accompanied the vice president back to Washington aboard Air Force
Two on Tuesday before returning to New Hampshire. On Wednesday
Sununu conducted routine state business.
   He also held a news conference at which he confirmed that he
discussed ``that job in particular'' _ the chief of staff post _
with Bush on Monday evening.
   ``We discussed what I might be involved in doing in general,''
Sununu said. ``It included a lot of positions in terms of general
interests, both his interests and my interests, and I'm going to
leave it at that.''
   ``You've heard me say I wouldn't go to Washington just to go to
Washington. I do think that chief of staff with a great president
can make a contribution,'' Sununu added.
   Sununu, an engineer who with his wife, Nancy, has eight children,
has said he was interested in getting a high-paying job in private
business.
   Asked about speculation that Bush might consider a ``troika'' to
head his White House staff consisting of Sununu and transition team
heads Craig Fuller and Robert Teeter, Sununu said, ``Both who is
going to do it and how it's going to be put together is (Bush's)
call.''
   Fuller, at a news conference in Washington, said he asked Bush on
Wednesday about reports that Sununu would be chief of staff.
   ``Let them know (that) when I am ready to make an announcement,
they'll hear it from me,'' Fuller quoted Bush as saying.
   Fuller said he did not know whether Bush had made the decision.
   Sununu would leave Bush with a right-hand aide with no Washington
experience but a reputation in six years as governor as a hands-on,
no-nonsense manager who turned a state deficit into a surplus.
   But some detractors also have called Sununu arrogant and abrasive.

   The cold front that unleashed the fury of tornadoes on the
nation's midsection the previous day spread eastward on Wednesday,
bringing up to 10 inches of snow, winds topping 50 mph and
wind-chill readings well below zero.
   Twisters killed six people in Arkansas and one in Missouri late
Tuesday, and injured dozens more in those states and Illinois, Iowa
and Kansas.
   As the violent cold front churned eastward, midday temperatures
in parts of Kansas and Missouri were 30 to 40 degrees lower
Wednesday than they had been the day before, and many areas got the
first real snowfall of the season, the National Weather Service said.
   At least three people were were reported dead in accidents on
snowy roads, and an Illinois woman was electrocuted after lightning
downed a power line in the northern city of Rockford. Cold, wind and
snow led to school closings in several states.
   Ten inches of snow fell at International Falls, Minn., Wednesday
morning, and the National Weather Service said there were hazardous
conditions in much of Minnesota because of snow and blowing snow.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered along the front, which
by midday extended across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys into the
central Gulf Coast. An inch of rain fell in less than two hours at
Fort Wayne, Ind.
   Winds gusted to 50 mph or more in Traverse City and Lansing,
Mich., and in Cleveland. High wind warnings or advisories were
posted in parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
   In Chicago, city workers scrambled to repair downed traffic
lights, clear fallen trees and open sewers clogged by heavy rains.
   ``We're so busy here, hon, I can't even turn around twice,'' said
Mary Church of the city's Streets and Sanitation Department. ``We
have really been hit hard _ but we're handling it.''
   The blustery winds combined with plunging temperatures to produce
wind-chill readings of zero to 20 below zero in northwestern Iowa,
western Minnesota and eastern North Dakota.
   But the severest weather had taken place farther south on Tuesday.
   ``I can't even tell what street I'm on because the trees are
uprooted,'' said Police Chief Darnell Scott of the central Arkansas
town of Lonoke. ``Damage is so bad. I think we were very lucky it
wasn't more tragic than it was.''
   Two people were killed near Lonoke, roughly 20 miles east of
Little Rock, when a van overturned on Interstate 40. The other
tornado victims in Arkansas were a young couple and their year-old
son whose mobile home was demolished in the nearby town of Scott,
and a man who died when his home was destroyed in Van Buren County,
north of Little Rock.
   An elderly woman died in Butterfield, in southwestern Missouri,
when a tornado threw her trailer home into the air, authorities said.
   ``It may be a little unusual for this time of year to have a
tornado outbreak like this, because they normally occur in spring,''
said meteorologist Brian Smith from the National Weather Service's
Severe Storms Center in Kansas City. But experts have said that
tornadoes have been recorded in every month.
   In Topeka, Kan., a tornado descended without warning, crashing
into Topeka West High School, but the injuries were described as
minor.
   ``Everyone's ears started popping and the teacher told us to get
down,'' said student Jennifer Stanley. ``All the windows started
popping out.''

   The Arizona Board of Pharmacy asked the R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. to voluntarily withdraw its test-marketed
smokeless cigarettes pending a determination of whether it is a
drug, but the company refused.
   The board did not determine whether the Premier cigarette is a
drug delivery system, as critics contend, or a non-burning
cigarette, as the company argues.
   Nor did it act on a request by the American Medical Association
to halt sales of Premier cigarettes in Arizona. A similar request
has been made of state officials in Missouri, where Premier also is
being test-marketed.
   R.J. Reynolds, in a statement from its headquarters in
Winston-Salem, N.C., declined to withdraw Premier from the market.
   ``Acceptance of Premier rests with the smokers, and we believe
they should be the final judges of the cigarette,'' the company said.
   The Arizona board also approved a motion to ask all interested
parties to submit pertinent information dealing with the tobacco
product for possible discussion at its scheduled Jan. 17 meeting.
But board members said a hearing on the issue would be unlikely then.
   The board voted 7-0 on member Michael W. Noel's motion to seek
voluntary withdrawal, after assistant attorney general Timothy J.
Agan declined to give the board legal advice in the public session,
``due to the possibility of litigation.''
   Noel's motion said the board has been unable ``to determine if
Premier is a drug or device over which it has authority to regulate
distribution and sale.''
   He said the board was soliciting information that will lead
ultimately to such a decision, but that ``the process will take
several months to complete.''
   The motion requested the voluntary withdrawal ``due to the
potential hazard to the health and safety of the citizens of
Arizona.''
   Jack LaSota, a former state attorney general representing
Reynolds, had urged the board to take no action on an AMA petition
filed with the board.
   The AMA asked the federal Food and Drug Administration in April
to take jurisdiction over the product as a drug, but the FDA has
been studying the issue and has yet to make a determination.
   Reynolds began test-marketing the product Oct. 1 in parts of
Arizona and Missouri. The AMA on Nov. 2 asked the Arizona board and
the Missouri Department of Health to bar sales.
   LaSota said a decision is expected from the FDA by the end of the
year, ``a scant six weeks away,'' and said the board should not act
before the FDA does.

<HEAD>Government Rescues Improve S&L Capital Results for Second Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings and loan industry capital increased for
the second consecutive month in September as the government, by
closing and rescuing failed institutions, began transferring the
industry's losses to its own books, the government said Wednesday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said capital _ representing the
difference between loans and other assets and deposits and other
liabilities _ increased $2.4 billion in September following a $6.1
billion increase in August. In the first seven months of the year,
the industry lost $6.1 billion in capital.
   Capital declines are often a good indicator of losses, but the
bank board began increasing the pace of S&L rescues in mid-August.
Rescues, in effect, wipe out the red ink of the failed institutions,
transferring it to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,
which insures deposits up to $100,000.
   The industry lost $7.5 billion in the first six months of this
year, and bank board economist James Barth has estimated third
quarter losses at about $2 billion.
   ``Not suprisingly, the use of financial assistance to protect
insured depositors exerts a positive effect on the overall financial
condition of the thrift industry,'' Barth said in a statement.
   The agency has dealt with more than 140 troubled institutions so
far this year.
   Meanwhile, deposits flowed out of the nation's 3,028 S&Ls for the
fifth consecutive month. The drain followed seven months of gains as
investors sought a safe haven for their money after the October 1987
stock market crash.
   Net withdrawals totaled $1.8 billion in September, down from $3.0
billion in August. For the first nine months of the year, S&Ls had
net new deposits of $6.7 billion, compared with net withdrawals of
$13.7 billion during the same period of 1987.
   Thrift institutions' mortgage lending business continued to
suffer with the decline in housing sales and construction. Mortgage
loans closed totaled $23.2 billion, down 5.6 percent from August and
down 12.6 percent from a year ago.
   For the first nine months of 1988, mortgage lending was off by
7.4 percent from the same period a year ago.

<HEAD>US Says No Dialogue Planned with PLO</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 7 grafs with Jerusalem mayor meeting with Reagan</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The State Department said Wednesday the policy
declaration by the Palestine Liberation Organization's parliament in
exile falls short of U.S. conditions for opening a dialogue with the
PLO.
   Spokesman Charles Redman suggested that the declaration moved the
PLO somewhat closer to U.S. requirements, but he said no dialogue is
contemplated because of ambiguities and other shortcomings in the
statement.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat had said Tuesday in Algiers that he
hoped the declaration would serve as the basis for a revived U.S.
effort to pursue a Middle East peace settlement.
   ``We feel that the ball is now in the American court,'' Arafat
said after the Palestinian National Council approved the declaration
which, among other provisions, accepts U.N. Security Council
resolutions as the basis for a Middle East settlement.
   The two resolutions imply recognition of Israel's right to exist,
but Redman said the PNC statement was insufficient because it was
ambiguous ``both in its meaning and placement in the text.''
   ``Recognition must be clear and unambiguous,'' Redman said.
   He said PLO repudiation of terrorist activities against civilian
targets was a restatement of the previous position. ``It is still
performance that counts,'' Redman said.
   The U.S. position on dealing with the PLO is that no dialogue can
take place until the PLO accepts U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338,
recognizes Israel's right to exist and renounces terrorism.
   The policy has been maintained since the Ford administration.
   The two resolutions call on Israel to withdraw from territories
occupied during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and assert the right of
all countries in the region to live within secure borders.
   Arafat refused to say explicitly Tuesday whether acceptance of
Resolution 242 meant recognition of Israel.
   The Reagan administration's assessment of the declaration
reflects only a short-term U.S. position because it has only nine
weeks left in office.
   Alluding to the impending leadership change in Washington before
the PNC meeting convened in Algiers, Arafat called on
President-elect George Bush to pressure Israel into making
concessions.
   Bush was non-committal on the PNC declaration when asked about it
Tuesday at a news conference.
   ``If, indeed, there is specific recognition of Security Council
Resolution 242, that would be a very important step forward,'' Bush
said.
   He added that he wanted to be sure such recognition was contained
in the statement before commenting further.
   If the PLO does recognize the resolution without qualifications,
``it would be something that we have been encouraging for a long,
long time and so you would view that with optimism,'' Bush said.
   Despite an overall negative assessment, Redman said there were
some encouraging signs coming out of the PNC meeting.
   He said there were indications that some Palestinians ``are
trying to move the PLO in a constructive way. That's encouraging and
should continue.''
   Meanwhile Wednesday, Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem met with
President Reagan and said PLO leaders had not advanced prospects for
Middle East peace.
   ``They didn't denounce terrorism; they didn't accept the
existence of Israel; they couched it altogether with all the
resolutions at the U.N. which were denying Israel,'' Kollek told
reporters. ``There was nothing to it ... There is no step forward on
their part which would enable us to negotiate.''
   Israeli Embassy spokesman Yossi Gal said Kollek, who is in the
United States on a fund-raising drive for various projects, met with
Reagan in the Oval Office for 10 minutes.
   Gal said Reagan thanked Kollek for the free access being granted
the faithful of all religions to the holy sites of Jerusalem.
   Kollek said he invited Reagan to visit Jerusalem. The embassy
spokesman said the president thanked him, saying he hadn't yet made
future plans.
   Reagan encouraged Kollek to continue his endeavors at promoting
tolerance in the volatile city he has governed for 23 years, Gal
said.
   Kollek gave Reagan a 1550 map that shows Jerusalem at the center
of the world, what would become the United States a tiny blob on the
side and the Soviet Union not at all.
   ``Every mayor believes his city is the center of the world, but I
have it documented,'' Kollek said he told the president.

<TEXT>
   A military court investigating the
killing of 14 fishermen by Venezuelan soldiers had two survivors
arrested Wednesday on charges of ``military rebellion,'' an
opposition leader said.
   Wolmer Gregorio Pinilla and Jose Augusto Arias were handed over
to military police in the presence of opposition politicians, Walter
Marquez of the leftist Socialist Movement party said from his
offices in San Cristobal.
   El Diario, a Caracas daily, reported Wednesday that the court at
San Cristobal, in Tachira state 330 miles southwest of Caracas,
exonerated the soldiers involved in the killings on grounds of
self-defense.
   It said the court did not state whether the 14 dead men were
guerrillas, as military spokesmen said after the shooting occurred
Oct. 29, or a party of fishermen. The survivors say it was a fishing
party and they escaped by jumping into the water from a dugout canoe
when soldiers opened fire.
   The shooting inspired student riots early this month in which at
least 60 people were wounded.
   Marquez said his party would urge the Supreme Court to pursue the
case.
   Townspeople of El Amparo, 350 miles southwest of Caracas near the
Colombian border, protected the two survivors when military
authorities tried to take them away after the incident. The men said
they feared for their lives, especially since the military
originally reported 16 killed in the encounter.
   Opposition leaders say the judge in the case reports directly to
the head of the Jose Antonio Paez brigade, which carried out the
killing. Marquez said: ``This decision is a complete violation of
justice.''
   He gave the survivors his protection after the shooting and told
their story to the press.
   On Wednesday, Marquez said: ``The military court has refused to
carry out even the most elementary investigations, such as exhuming
the bodies to determine whether or not the dead men had fired any
weapons before they were killed.''
   He claimed the military planted weapons on the dead men, dressed
the bodies in uniforms of the Colombian National Liberation Army, a
guerrilla group, and poured acid on the faces to prevent
identification.
   Soon after the attack on the men, the government called it ``the
result of a confusion.''
   In its arrest order, the military court said the 14 dead were
``co-authors'' with the two survivors of ``military rebellion'' and
declared the investigation ended because the dead men could not
testify, Marquez said.
   Military rebellion is a general term often used to justify
detention without cause, Amnesty International said in a report on
Venezuela published in October.

<HEAD>Farmer Charged With Cruelty In Deaths Of 20,000 Chickens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KILLINGLY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A farmer has been accused of cruelty to
animals for allegedly allowing 20,000 chickens to die of
malnutrition and dehydration.
   Timothy Panteleakos, 32, of Canterbury was arrested on the
cruelty charge Tuesday by a Connecticut Humane Society officer. He
was released on a written promise to appear Nov. 28 in Superior
Court.
   Only fires and natural disasters have caused greater poultry
losses in the state, said William Harrington, chief of the
Connecticut Department of Agriculture's livestock division.
   State officials discovered the chickens on Oct. 31 after they
were notified that tens of thousands of chickens were dead or near
death at Panteleakos' farm, said Laurie Greene, the state
veterinarian.
   About 8,700 chickens were living when officials arrived at the
20-acre farm, Greene said. With the farm's feeding machine in
disrepair, officials fed the chickens by hand throughout the night,
using two tons of grain trucked in by the state.
   The health of the malnourished chickens improved after a week,
during which they were fed with a total of seven tons of
state-purchased grain.
   A New Jersey-based chicken rendering company agreed to pick up
the remaining live chickens at no cost.
   Greene said the Agriculture Department and the state Department
of Environmental Protection had cited the farm repeatedly during the
past year on health code and other violations.
   On Sept. 30, a state hearing officer recommended that the farm be
shut down, but Panteleakos appealed the decision to Agriculture
Commissioner Kenneth B. Andersen. The commissioner rejected the
appeal.
   Panteleakos, who operated the farm for about a year and who had
previous poultry farming experience, said the state shares the blame
for the loss.
   Panteleakos contended that the state ignored his requests for
assistance, and that ``health conditions were no worse or better
than other chicken farms.''
   ``This was a farmer in dire need,'' he said. ``I needed financial
help. ... I feel I'm the victim here.''
   Greene disputed Panteleakos' explanation. She said he never
sought help voluntarily, and that local, state and federal agencies
would have offered assistance.
   The 20,000 dead chickens, which officials said died during a
two-week period in late October, were buried in the Killingly dump.
The cost of the grain and disposal of the dead chickens was about
$3,000, Greene said, adding the state probably will seek restitution.
   Cruelty to animals is a misdemeanor punishable by a $75 fine or a
year in jail or both, said Don DuPont, a humane society police
officer.

Accusations</HEAD>

   A watchdog commission founded by the Nestle
company said Wednesday it has found no evidence to support
allegations the international food products giant is violating an
agreement against ``dumping'' infant formula in Third World
countries.
   However, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, head of the
11-member commission, acknowledged that the panel had not examined
specific allegations because no specific complaints were filed by an
organization that called last month for a resumption of a boycott of
Nestle products.
   ``The system has broken down to the extent complaints are no
longer submitted to us,'' Muskie said at a news conference.
   A Minneapolis-based group called Action for Corporate
Accountability called for a resumption of the seven-year boycott,
ended in 1984, on grounds Nestle was failing to live up to the
spirit of a World Health Organization-sanctioned agreement on infant
formula marketing that prompted an end to the earlier boycott.
   Muskie acknowledged that his panel could only examine whether
Nestle was following the letter of the agreement since it had no
specific allegations of violations to investigate.
   ``All we have to rely on is a generalized accusation,'' said
Muskie.
   Action for Corporate Accountability charged Oct. 4 that Nestle is
dumping infant formula in Third World countries _ that is, supplying
large quantities of free formula to mothers of newborn infants in an
effort to get the mothers and babies ``hooked'' on bottle feeding
rather than breast feeding.
   Muskie said the commission does not agree with that assessment
and noted that the WHO agreement does not ban the supply of
reasonable amounts of free formula to meet the needs of poor mothers
who need the product and can't afford it.
   ``It is Nestle's standard practice to require that responsible
staff at each health institution complete a detailed request form
before supplies are delivered,'' Muskie said. ``In an effort to make
sure that the quantities required are appropriate, Nestle also
audits the amount of supplies it donates. In some instances, Nestle
has reduced the amount of formula that it provides.''
   Under questioning, Muskie acknowledged that Action for Corporate
Accountability and other Nestle critics apparently have lost
confidence in the panel's credibility since they no longer file
complaints with the committee as they did prior to the 1986 WHO
agreement.
   ``They have accepted our credibility, at least until now,'' he
said. Later, he added, ``We consider that we are in a position to
try to be helpful'' and said, ``We're hoping that out of this
difference of opinion ... we can shape a (new) relationship.''

<HEAD>Army Sends Troops to Quell Violence, Strikes in South</HEAD>

   The government said Wednesday it sent
army reinforcements to break a wave of violence, demonstrations and
strikes by Sinhalese extremists that has paralyzed a southern region.
   Extremists hurled a bomb at a bus in Ja-ela, about 10 miles north
of Colombo, injuring nine people, said officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The strikes, which began two weeks ago, have closed schools,
shops and offices and brought public transportation to a stop in the
Southern Province, one of the eight provinces of Sri Lanka.
   Additional soldiers were sent to the province after its top
official, Chief Minister M.S. Amarasiri, appealed for help.
Amarasiri said the troops would try to force people to return to
work.
   On Tuesday, the army opened fire on thousands of people in towns
just north of Colombo who were protesting the massacre of 27
Sinhalese bus passengers by suspected Tamil rebels, police said.
Five protesters were killed.
   Military officials, who demanded anonymity, said Monday's bus
attack in a village north of Colombo was part of a battle by Sri
Lanka's minority Tamils to drive the majority Sinhalese from the
northeast, where the rebels have waged a five-year campaign for an
independent homeland.
   The Tamils, who represent 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who
form 75 percent of the population and control the military and the
government.
   The government's peace overtures to the Tamils have sparked a
backlash among extremist Sinhalese, who claim too many concessions
have been offered to the minority community.
   The Southern Province, which has a majority Sinhalese population,
is the center of the anti-government sentiment.
   On Tuesday, Sinhalese radicals shot and killed at least seven
fellow Sinhalese, the military officials said.
   Four of the victims died in Elpitiya, about 50 miles south of
Colombo, and the other three were bus drivers killed on the job, the
officials said.
   The People's Liberation Front, a radical Sinhalese group, called
strikes throughout the country two weeks ago in an attempt to force
President Junius R. Jayewardene to dissolve Parliament and resign.
   They have accused Jayewardene, who is Sinhalese, of selling out
the interests of this island nation's majority ethnic group to
pacify the Tamils.
   The extremists have rejected a July 1987 peace accord that
offered the Tamils limited autonomy if they surrendered their arms.
They have vowed to kill anyone who supports the accord and are
blamed for the deaths of more than 550 people, mostly Sinhalese
government officials and their supporters.
   The Tamils also rejected the accord and are fighting government
troops and Indian peacekeeping forces sent to Sri Lanka last year.
   To combat the spiraling violence in the south, Jayewardene issued
emergency decrees that allow the army to open fire on
anti-government demonstrators and to arrest anyone instigating
strikes. People convicted of starting strikes are subject to death
by hanging.

<HEAD>Mail, Phone Service Restored As Workers End Walkouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mail was being delivered and phone
calls were getting through Wednesday after workers ended strikes
that had paralyzed postal and long-distance telephone services.
   Federal court clerks and teachers also ended walkouts in what has
been a months-long effort by the state's approximately one million
employees to win pay boosts to keep up with triple-digit inflation
and recover lost purchasing power.
   The government, which has tried to tightly control increases in
state pay, warned Tuesday night that it will not depart from an
inflation-fighting program adopted in August despite pressure from
unions and business groups.
   Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille, speaking to the Argentine
Chamber of Commerce, said: ``There will be no modification in our
program of stabilization.'' He said inflation-fanning pay increases
will not be tolerated.
   Inflation slowed to 9 percent in October compared with 11.7
percent in September and 27.6 percent in August. Inflation has
soared more than 300 percent since January and more than 440 percent
for the 12-month period ending Sept. 30.
   The government has said business leaders agreed to limit price
increases to below 4 percent a month, and promised that monthly
public utility rate increases will not surpass that amount.
   Postal workers voted Tuesday night to end their 26-day work
stoppage after the Labor Ministry warned that it would declare the
strike illegal, allowing time lost to the strike to be deducted from
pay.
   Unions representing about 30,000 postal workers began their
strike more than three weeks ago to obtain what leaders said was $4
million in unpaid overtime and bonuses.
   Telephone workers ended their 36-hour walkout Tuesday afternoon
when state telephone company officials agreed to complete payment of
a second installment of wage arrears. The strike had affected
long-distance calls, customer service and repair work.
   In separate strike action, federal court workers in the capital
and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Rio Negro, Chubut, Neuquen, Santa
Cruz and the territory of Tierra del Fuego struck for 24 hours
Tuesday to press for an immediate wage adjustment.
   Union leaders said teachers in Buenos Aires and the country's
northeastern provinces took part in a walkout Tuesday in support of
pay demands and recognition of a union wage policy committee.
   At the Economy Ministry some 1,800 employees remained off the job
for a third day Wednesday in an indefinite walkout that started
Monday in search of pay increases.

<TEXT>
   Five members of the elite
Carabinieri paramilitary force were shot and killed Wednesday in
their barracks in central Italy, officials said.
   Italian news agencies said investigators speculated one of the
Carabinieri went berserk, killed the other four with submachine-gun
fire, and then took his own life with his service revolver.
   The news agency AGI quoted prosecutor Aldo Ricciuti as ruling out
an attack by terrorists or common criminals.
   Interior Minister Antonio Gava told Parliament Wednesday night
that there was no evidence of ``an attack from outside.''
   ``Still, at the moment it is not possible to formulate hypotheses
on the exact sequence of events,'' he said.
   A passer-by heard shots at about noon and alerted police, who
found the bodies in one room of the barracks, said a spokesman at
the Rome headquarters of the Carabinieri.
   The official, speaking on the usual condition on anonymity, said
investigators had no immediate clue as to who carried out the
killings and why.
   The agencies said at least 11 submachine shells were found along
with two spent pistol shells.
   Bagnara di Romagna is a town of 2,000 people near Ravenna, about
215 miles northeast of Rome.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Americans jailed four months for
allegedly taking part in a plot to kill President Samuel Doe were
freed Wednesday after Doe ordered the charges dropped.
   Former U.S. Army Sgt. James Henry Bush, 40, a Vietnam War veteran
from Raleigh, N.C., and Curtis Hayes Williams, 45, of Jersey City,
N.J., said they would return to the United States on Thursday.
   Mike Jackson, a Liberian living in exile in Ivory Coast and
charged in the same case, also was ordered freed.
   A grand jury in September indicted Bush, Jackson and Williams on
charges of involvement in a July 13 coup attempt allegedly led by
Doe's former second in command, Maj. Gen. Nicholas Podier.
   ``I'm overjoyed he's coming home. He hasn't seen his baby girl
yet,'' said Williams' wife, Gwendolyn Williams, in Jersey City. Mrs.
Williams gave birth 10 weeks ago to a baby her husband has not seen.
   Doe said in a statement Tuesday he ordered charges against the
three dropped as a ``manifestation of good will to the U.S.
President-elect George Bush.''
   The three were charged with illegally entering Liberia with the
intent of overthrowing the government and killing Doe, offenses
punishable by death.
   Minister of Justice Jenkins Scott said: ``The individuals
involved ... have written to the president and expressed their
apology for their involvement with Podier. I think justice has been
properly served and that the individuals expressed their regrets.''
   Scott said the letter was written in the presence of the
defendants' attorneys.
   Doe said his action was ``based upon the long-standing and
cordial relationship between the government and the people of
Liberia and the government and people of the United States of
America.''
   The West African nation was established in 1847 by former
American slaves.
   Five members of the purported coup plot, including Podier, were
killed in a July 13 clash with Liberian security men.
   The government said the coup plotters entered the country from
Ivory Coast on July 10 near the village of Gbolay. They purportedly
hid in the forest, but were discovered by security forces on July 13
and a firefight ensued.
   Doe, then an army master sergeant, took power in an April 12,
1980, coup, overthrowing the government of William Tolbert and
killing the civilian leader.

   Former presidential aide Oliver L. North is
seeking to scuttle the criminal charges against him by trying to
disclose national secrets irrelevant to his defense, Iran-Contra
prosecutors charged Wednesday.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh sought a court order
barring North from revealing any government secrets in his defense
of charges he conspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale
proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Walsh contended in court papers that the former presidential aide
had flouted court orders ``by not presenting a good-faith listing of
the classified documents that he reasonably deems necessary to
defend against the indictment.''
   Walsh charged that North's ``grossly overblown'' list of secret
government documents he wants to use as trial exhibits includes
items that ``are simple efforts at graymail and have no conceivable
bearing on the charges in the indictment.''
   North's list of 40,000 pages of top-secret documents
``demonstrates once again his expectation that intransigence will
encumber the processes of law, threaten some of our nation's most
valuable secrets and provoke a dismissal of the case,'' Walsh said.
   The prosecution asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to
invoke a provision of the Classified Information Procedures Act
(CIPA) barring North from disclosing any classified government
information.
   ``North arrogantly disregarded the court's repeated orders
defining his obligations under CIPA,'' Walsh said. ``Given North's
persistent efforts on all fronts to delay the trial of this case and
his repeated flouting of CIPA and the court's orders, fairness and
respect for the court's procedures require an order exercising the
court's preclusion powers.''
   North's attorneys, who customarily do not comment on the case,
did not return a reporter's telephone call.
   Under the secrecy law, proposed defense exhibits would be
reviewed in secret court hearings to determine if the material can
be presented in public form.
   Walsh contended that North ``has been determined to force a
failure of CIPA's procedures'' by filing ``a bloated notice that is
calculated to overwhelm the court's and the government's abilities
to conduct'' those proceedings.
   ``Whereas a fair and measured notice, consistent with the orders
of the court, might properly have tested CIPA, the present notice is
so grossly overblown that it invites dismissal for lack of good
faith,'' he said in response to the list North filed Monday under
court seal.
   North lists documents ``which are far afield from any logical
defense,'' including ``large swatches of CIA cables concerning
Nicaragua that bear only the most tangential relation to the subject
matter in the case,'' Walsh said.
   He accused North of trying to force the Justice Department to
drop the charges ``based purely on fear that the price, in terms of
the threat to national security is too high'' to proceed with the
case. Under CIPA, the Justice Department, not Walsh, would make such
a decision.
   Last summer, Gesell rejected as ``wholly insufficient'' the first
notices that North filed on Aug. 1, later saying that they
``blatantly lacked any attempt at particularization.'' The judge
gave North until Nov. 14 to file notices that met the requirements
he set.
   ``The court generously gave North and his attorneys three
additional months _ on top of the initial document review period
they had already enjoyed up to that point _ to determine which
classified documents would be necessary to defend against each of
the criminal charges,'' Walsh said.
   ``It would be inappropriate, futile and unfair for the court,
now, as the case moves through final pre-trial proceedings, to offer
defendant still more time to try again,'' the prosecution said.
   The former National Security Council aide and retired Marine
lieutenant colonel is charged with conspiring with former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim
and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord to defraud the
government by diverting arms-sale profits to the Contras.
   No date has been set for the trial of North, the first of four
separate proceedings ordered by Gesell.

   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops on
Wednesday rejected a draft Vatican document that questioned the
authority of conferences such as theirs.
   First, however, the bishops greatly softened the tone of their
reply, removing the confrontational language of an earlier version.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago said of the Vatican draft,
``We think the document is so flawed that the Holy See should start
over.'' His fellow bishops agreed to send essentially that message
to Rome, by a 205-59 vote that was barely above the necessary
two-thirds of the conference's 305 active members.
   The Vatican has asked all national bishops conferences to respond
to its draft document on the role of such bodies in the church, and
no final version is expected for months or even years.
   American bishops on both sides of the issue decried any
suggestion that the issue amounted to a significant dispute between
the Vatican and themselves.
   Pope John Paul II has publicly praised the American bishops' most
controversial efforts _ their national pastoral letters taking issue
with Reagan administration policies on nuclear weapons and on
treatment of the poor.
   However, Vatican officials, noting the rising prominence of
national bishops conferences, have taken pains to point out publicly
that such organizations are not part of the Roman church's
traditional hierarchy.
   The Vatican draft attempts to make that same point, saying
bishops conferences have little real standing, that the church
lodges authority in the individual bishops under the pope, the
bishop of Rome.
   The U.S. bishops, in their reply, do not lay out a case arguing
that the Vatican is wrong. Rather, they argue that the Vatican
distorts some evidence and gives only one side of the matter in its
draft.
   Earlier this week, as the conference's annual meeting got under
way, Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, a former conference
president, announced that the proposed notice of rejection _ already
widely publicized in news stories _ had been rewritten.
   Gone from the bishops' proposed description of the Vatican draft
were such phrases as ``rigid and confusing'' and ``overly defensive
and negative.''
   Then Wednesday, by voice vote, the bishops deleted these words:
``non placet _ the draft is not suitable.'' Several bishops had
argued that the phrase, especially the formal Latin, was too blunt,
bordering on being offensive to the Vatican.
   Still, the final version says elsewhere, ``We do not believe that
the working document is suitable as a basis for discussion.''
   Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston called for removal of that
sentence, too, but when he saw the other side had more votes he
withdrew his amendment, saying, ``Half a loaf is better than none.''
   Some bishops have criticized news accounts of the dispute.
   However, Archbishop John Roach of St. Paul-Minneapolis, another
former conference president who served on Malone's committee in
preparing the bishops' response, said the news media ``did us a real
favor'' in publicizing negative aspects of the original version of
the response.
   ``They perceived a sharpness in the tone of the document which I
don't think we intended'' and helped spur the bishops to change that
tone, he said at a news conference.
   On another topic, the bishops voted Wednesday to set guidelines
on who can preach during Catholic masses, and when.
   Several bishops said the guidelines could lead to more preaching
by lay men and women. But others noted the guidelines' clear
strictures against anyone other than an ordained minister giving the
main sermon interpreting the gospel during mass.
   Retired Bishop William McManus of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Ind.,
argued that reiterating that implicit ban on some preaching by women
_ who cannot be ordained as Catholic ministers _ would be an
unnecessary new ``source of irritation'' for women in the
denomination.
   He put forward what he described as the ridiculous possibility
that a local church would have Mother Teresa as its guest but could
allow her to speak only early in the service or at the very end,
leaving the main sermon to a male deacon parroting ``Bible lessons
he learned in the second grade.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm dumped up to 10 inches of snow on the Canadian-Minnesota
border on Wednesday as an intense low-pressure system moved into
Canada. Gusty winds blew from the northern Plains through the upper
and middle Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes.
   Temperatures plunged in Illinois on the heels of a storm system
that created as many as 49 tornadoes Tuesday in five states in the
South and Midwest. In Chicago, city workers scrambled Wednesday to
repair downed traffic lights, clear fallen trees and open sewers
clogged by heavy rains.
   An inch of rain fell in less than two hours Wednesday morning at
Fort Wayne, Ind.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered along the cold front
that extended across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys into the central
Gulf Coast.
   Snow and blowing snow brought hazardous weather to much of
Minnesota. Ten inches of snow fell at International Falls by
Wednesday morning, and amounts of 4 to 8 inches were reported from
central into northeast Minnesota.
   Winds guested to 56 mph at Traverse City, Mich., and Cleveland
and to 51 mph at Lansing, Mich., early Wednesday afternoon.
   Cold air spread throughout the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
Temperatures at midday were 30 to 40 degrees colder than at the same
time Tuesday from eastern Kansas into western and northern Missouri.
Temperatures were 20 degrees colder from northern Illinois into
Texas.
   Rain fell from western Oregon into northern and central
California.
   Snow advisories were posted across the Cascades of Washington
state and Oregon for Wednesday night, with snowfalls of 4 to 8
inches predicted by Thursday morning.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included nearly an inch at Jackson, Miss., and more than
three-quarters of an inch at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees in Havre, Mont., to 88 in Fort Myers and Tampa, Florida. The
low in the nation Wednesday morning was 7 degrees below zero at
Havre.
   Thursday's forecast called rain likely across New England and the
mid-Atlantic Coast, with rain diminishing over the upper Ohio
Valley. Showers and thunderstorms were expected to be scattered from
the Carolinas into Florida. Snow showers should occur across parts
of upper Michigan and northern lower Michigan. Rain also was
predicted to be scattered across the Pacific Northwest into northern
and central California valleys, with snow widespread from the
northern Rockies into the central Intermountain region west of the
central Rockies and the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 40s or 50s across
much of the nation, 30s from the northern Rockies through the
northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley into the upper Great
Lakes, 60s from Southern California through the southern Rockies,
the southern Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley and southern
Appalachians and into the mid-Atlantic Coast, 70s in southern
Arizona and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and from the Florida
Panhandle to the Carolinas coast. Highs should be in the 80s in
central and southern Florida.

   Estonia's parliament declared the tiny
Baltic republic ``sovereign'' Wednesday, with the right to veto
Soviet laws. Deputies said too much Kremlin control had ruined the
economy and environment.
   The vote of 258-1, with five abstentions, on the ``declaration of
sovereignty'' followed a restrained, serious debate in the Supreme
Soviet of the Baltic republic.
   Its declaration stopped short of complete independence, but calls
for a treaty with Moscow that would ``determine the further status
of Estonia in the composition of the Soviet Union.''
   Moscow gave no immediate indication of its reaction to the
apparent attempt to subordinate Soviet law to the will of Estonia's
highest government body.
   In the first report by official national media, Moscow radio said
without comment that ``by a majority of votes, members of Estonia's
parliament gave priority to Estonia's laws over national ones.''
   Proponents of the Estonian action said it was consistent with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's calls for greater democratization
and local control, and with ritual declarations of autonomy for the
republics contained in the Soviet constitution.
   Similar proclamations in other Baltic and non-Slavic republics
could follow.
   Marju Lauristen, a leader of the Estonian People's Front, a
grassroots political organization, acknowledged that Gorbachev might
not be pleased.
   ``I personally think that, perhaps in the beginning, he'll be
angry,'' she said in an interview. ``But when he thinks deeply,
he'll think we've supported perestroika more deeply than he
expected. Moscow could have expected worse.''
   Perestroika is what Gorbachev calls his plans for economic and
social reform in the Soviet Union.
   Deputies voted on the declaration after a full day of debate,
televised from Tallinn's 18th century Toompea Palace, in which they
detailed the republic's need to control its own land, factories and
laws.
   A vote on related amendments to the Estonian Constitution passed
254-7 minutes before the vote on the declaration.
   Among the amendments was one subjecting new Soviet laws to local
control. If the Presidium, Estonia's top executive body, rejected a
Soviet law the amendment would postpone its application until the
next meeting of the Supreme Soviet, said Igor Grazin, a law
professor who wrote the amemdment.
   If the parliament concurs, the law would be declared void in
Estonia, he said.
   The other four amendments add human and civil rights guarantees,
claim the land and natural resources of the republic as the property
of Estonia rather than of the ``state,'' and guarantee the right to
hold private property.
   The passage of such measures by a government body is an
unprecedented act of defiance toward central authorities in a nation
still feeling its way through Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
greater openness.
   The parliament compromised on a resolution that originally
demanded that Moscow cancel plans to amend the Soviet Constitution
after Soviet leaders hinted that this would be fruitless, and said
that further amendements would safeguard the rights of the republics.
   Estonian lawmakers instead unanimously called for changes in the
amendments to reduce the shift in power from the 15 Soviet republics
to the central government in Moscow, and to retain the republics'
right to secede.
   The Soviet amendments, which also remove the republics' right to
secede, are scheduled for adoption Nov. 29, and authorities have
shown no sign of backing down, despite opposition in Estonia and the
other Baltic republics, Latvia and Lithuania. The three were
independent states until a 1939 pact deeded control to the Kremlin.
   Estonian radio reported Wednesday that 2.6 million people in the
three republics have signed petitions opposing the Soviet
amendments. That would represent nearly a third of the republics'
combined populations of 7.7 million people.
   Deputies from largely Russian-speaking regions and factories in
Estonia complained of haste in the proposals for Estonian
sovereignty and pleaded for delay more often than outright defeat of
the measures.
   ``They have been proposed behind our backs,'' complained Vladimir
Andreyev, a Russian power plant mechanic from Narva.
   Estonian activists' strategy rests on the traditional claim of
the Soviet Union to be a federation of independent republics. The
activists say they are simply reminding authorities in Moscow that
they were promised such sovereignty when Estonia was absorbed by the
Soviet Union.
   People's Front leader Edgar Savisaar said a recent opinion poll
found that 56 percent of the Estonian-speaking population and 10
percent of the Russian-speaking population of the republic favor
secession as a last resort.
   The republic of 1.6 million people is by no means united behind
the measures. A competing movement called the ``Internationalists''
has been telling Russian speakers that the Estonian nationalist mood
will lead to discrimination against them.
   Lawmakers on Wednesday also unanimously named Indrek K. Toome, a
reform-minded Communist Party official, as the republic's prime
minister.

   A Bankruptcy Court judge on Wednesday threw
out pending offers for PTL's assets and ordered an auction Thursday
in the federal courtroom, with bidding to begin at $115 million.
   ``It's really wide open,'' PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red''
Benton said after the Wednesday afternoon hearing.
   Though Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds still must approve any
buyer, his order signals an approaching end to months of delays in
selling the ministry's satellite television ministry, Heritage USA
theme park and 1,700 acres of undeveloped property near Fort Mill.
   Proceeds will go toward satisfying the ministry's debts,
estimated to be as high as $130 million and which include some $55
million claimed by the Internal Revenue Service.
   Reynolds said neither a $115 million, financed offer by Toronto
businessman Stephen Mernick nor a $113 million, financed, or $70
million cash bid by Vancouver businessman Peter Thomas were
acceptable. In part, he said, that's because all contained clauses
allowing the buyer to walk away from the purchase within a certain
time after closing.
   Benton had recommended Mernick as the ministry's buyer.
   Neither Mernick nor Thomas would say whether they intended to bid
at the public auction set for 9:30 a.m.
   Thomas said he planned to attend and would consider his position
overnight. Mernick spokesman Alex Coffin said Mernick did not plan
to attend.
   ``He's just carefully considering this,'' Coffin said of
Reynold's ruling, ``and will make his decisions known tomorrow.''
   Benton said the two men remain the most viable bidders, but that
he expects several other groups to try to meet the $1 million
Reynolds set as the entrance fee. Thomas and Mernick are not
required to put up the money since their financial backing already
has been examined.
   Bidders have been eyeing the PTL ministry since this spring, when
Reynolds ordered that plans to liquidate the ministry begin.
   In addition to forbidding a so-called walk-away provision,
Reynolds outlined several conditions any purchaser must meet:
   _ A deposit of 5 percent of the total purchase price must be made.
   _ If money is borrowed using the assets as collateral, the first
$50 million borrowed must go toward the purchase. Of anything above
that, half must go toward the purchase and the other half toward
making capital improvements on the property.
   _ The balance must be paid off over five years, with terms over
the first four years similar to those of a 9 percent, 25-year loan.
The remaining balance must be paid in the fifth year.
   Mernick had proposed no down-payment and planned to borrow $80
million against the property, with which he would pay $50 million
toward the purchase. The remaining $65 million would have been paid
within five years, with the bulk in the fifth year.
   PTL filed for bankruptcy protection in June 1987, three months
after its founder Jim Bakker stepped aside after admitting having a
sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker's own $172 million bid for the ministry fell through in
September when he was unable to raise a $3 million down-payment. He
received a further setback last week when Reynolds ordered Bakker,
his wife, Tammy, and former aide David Taggart to repay PTL nearly
$7.7 million in excessive benefits.
   Bakker was not present at the hearing, and calls to Bakker
attorney Ryan Hovis' office in Rock Hill were unanswered Wednesday
evening.

<HEAD>Orkin Gets $350,000 Fine, Probation In Fatal Fumigation</HEAD>

   A federal judge who criticized Orkin
Exterminating Co.'s ``scary'' disregard of safety standards fined
the corporation $350,000 Wednesday for a fumigation that killed a
Galax couple.
   ``It's almost a miracle that something like this didn't happen
before,'' U.S. District Judge James Turk said in sentencing Orkin
for failing to monitor the air in the home of Hubert and Freida
Watson after it was fumigated on Sept. 25, 1986. Watson, 73, died
three days after the fumigation with the chemical Vikane, and Mrs.
Watson, 65, died in three more days.
   ``I have no doubt at all but that they died from Vikane
poisoning,'' the judge said. ``It's nothing short of scary the way
the company was handling its business.''
   Turk imposed the maximum $500,000 fine, but told Orkin officials
they will only have to pay $350,000 if the company stays out of
trouble for a two-year probationary period. The judge also ordered
corporate officials to perform 2,000 hours of community service,
although none of the officials was named a defendant in the case.
   ``I think naturally we're disappointed,'' Orkin spokeswoman Judy
Donner said Wednesday evening from the company's Atlanta
headquarters. ``The company wants to express sympathy to the Watson
family for the loss.''
   Orkin President Bob Mercer was the final witness in the two-day
sentencing hearing for Orkin's one-count conviction. The company was
convicted of failing to follow directions on the label of the Vikane
container when it did not monitor the air in the Watson home as the
fumigation tent shrouding the home was removed and the Watsons were
allowed back inside.
   Evidence indicated Orkin also failed to remove a waterproof
mattress cover that could have trapped the poisonous gas.
   ``That was a tomb sealed up, waiting for the occupants to enter
and lay down and die,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Pierce said.
   Orkin reached an out-of-court settlement with the family's estate
two months ago. Neither side has disclosed the terms.
   Several past and present Orkin employees testified that
throughout numerous fumigations in Virginia, safety standards,
including the air monitoring, were never followed. The former Orkin
employee who supervised the fumigation, Ronald Dean Mullins,
testified that he had never even read the ``fine print'' on a Vikane
label.
   ``I recognize there was a failure to carry out Orkin's policy and
procedure,'' Mercer testified Wednesday. He said that since he
became president in February, the company has worked to improve its
training.
   Ms. Donner would not comment when asked whether Orkin procedures
were being followed in other states.
   Asked whether Orkin management monitors compliance or
noncompliance with safety standards throughout the nation, Ms.
Donner said, ``I think I'd like to stick to comment on the case
itself.''
   Turk convicted Orkin in August after the government and the
company agreed to a set of facts concerning the exterminator's
failure to use the air monitor. The judge threw out four other
counts alleging unsafe application of the Vikane.
   Defense attorney Sam Wilson said monitoring the Watson home for
Vikane might not have made a difference, because in 1986, the pest
control industry used monitors that have since become outdated. But
the judge said that testimony indicated the old monitors erred on
the side of safety.

   A top military officer said Wednesday
that soldiers or police could be behind some of the recent
disappearances of scores of human rights activists and unionists.
   But Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, the Manila-area regional
commander, also said in a telephone interview that reports of
disappearances could be part of a smear campaign to discredit the
armed forces.
   ``It could be that they voluntarily disappeared, or people went
underground,'' Aguirre said. ``It appears also there is a pattern of
smear campaign, of making conclusions that disappearances were
caused by the military.''
   Aguirre did not rule out that military personnel were responsible
for some of the disappearances.
   ``The other possibility is that it could have been done by some
of our agents,'' Aguirre added. ``That's not sanctioned by the
military.''
   Meanwhile, suspected communist rebels fatally shot an officer of
President Corazon Aquino's guards Wednesday as he was driving along
a coastal highway south of the capital.
   Police said Lt. Jerson Nueva, 31, an officer of Mrs. Aquino's
elite Presidential Security Group, was found slumped at the wheel of
his car with a gunshot wound in the head.
   Police speculated that Nueva may have been slain by communist
guerrillas. The rebels have claimed responsibility for killing
soldiers and policemen here since 1987.
   Also Wednesday, military chief of staff Gen. Renato de Villa
summoned senior officers to discuss the recent wave of
disappearances of trade unionists, human rights workers and
leftists. Aguirre was among those attending the session.
   Armed forces spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said he had no
knowledge of the meeting, but added the military is preparing a
report within the week on the cases of 73 missing unionists.
   The Task Force Detainees of the Philippines, a church-affiliated
organization, says 82 social activists, leftists and trade union
organizers have disappeared nationwide during the first six months
of 1988.
   The left-wing New Patriotic Alliance said 15 of its members had
disappeared in the Manila area so far this year.
   Military officials claim the Alliance is a front for the banned
Communist Party of the Philippines, which has been waging a
19-year-old insurgency to establish a Marxist state.
   Amnesty International reported this year that more than 100
leftist and social activists were slain in the Philippines in 1987,
apparently by military and paramilitary groups battling the
communist insurgency.
   Leftist and human rights groups have blamed the military for the
disappearances which they say is part of an effort to crush legal
left-wing organizations.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Aquino said allegations that the military was
behind the disappearances were ``premature and unfounded.''
   Mrs. Aquino succeeded Ferdinand Marcos in a February 1986 popular
uprising and pledged to end the human rights abuses that were
rampant during her predecessor's 20-year administration.

<HEAD>Kerry: Military Aid, Marshall Plan Needed To Help Latin America
Fight Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate narcotics panel said
Wednesday that Latin American drug cartels pose a ``more immediate
and effective'' national security threat than the spread of
communism, and the United States should be willing to provide
military aid to drug-fighting nations.
   ``The drug cartels do represent a national security threat to the
United States and our friends and allies abroad. The sooner we
understand this fact of life, the sooner we can begin waging a
serious war on drugs,'' said Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass. ```Just Say
No' is just not enough. It just hasn't worked.''
   Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
narcotics, terrorism and international operations, said the new
administration must focus its national security initiatives on the
narcotics trade.
   ``In the post-World War II era, the national security focus of
the United States was framed by our predominate concern with ...
Marxist expansion,'' which led to ``a series of extraordinary steps
to respond to that threat'' such as the Marshall Plan, NATO, the
nuclear buildup and involvement in Korea and Vietnam, Kerry said.
   ``Now we must take equally drastic steps to combat the new threat
to our national security, the tide of drugs which are flooding our
hemisphere,'' he said.
   Outlining a ``Strategic Drug Initiative'' in remarks prepared for
an evening address at Georgetown University, Kerry said the Bush
administration should be willing to provide, with congressional
approval, military assistance to Latin American governments trying
to fight drug trafficking.
   ``If our allies need hardware to fight the war on drugs, we
should give it to them,'' Kerry said. ``If they want help in taking
out a cocaine processing lab, we should provide that assistance. If
they want help in the tracking of drug traffickers on aircraft and
ships, we should offer that help.''
   The senator also advocated a sweeping economic aid program,
similar to the Marshall Plan imposed after World War II to help
Western Europe, to bolster devastated Latin American economies and
help reduce their reliance on the drug trade.
   ``All of us are concerned about the spread of communism in Latin
America and elsewhere, but we cannot afford to put on blinders to
other threats which are equally grave. Drugs in this hemisphere are
an equal threat, and they are a more immediate and effective
threat,'' the senator said.
   Kerry, whose subcommittee has been investigating drug trafficking
in Latin America for two years, also called for a drug summit with
Western Hemisphere presidents, stiffer bank regulations to halt
money laundering and improved information exchanges among various
U.S. intelligence agencies.

<HEAD>MacKay Concedes Florida Senate Race To Mack 8 Days After Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OCALA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay conceded the
Florida U.S. Senate race to Republican Connie Mack on Wednesday,
eight days after their tight election.
   ``This election is over,'' MacKay told reporters at his home here.
   He said he would challenge none of the alleged irregularities
that had spurred him to ask for second looks at the voting in five
large counties.
   ``We have satisfied ourselves that all the votes that were cast
were counted, and that's all we wanted,'' said the 55-year-old,
three-term congressman, who lost by more than 31,000 votes. ``The
people have spoken. Congratulations to Connie Mack.''
   Mack, vacationing in Vermont, told The Associated Press:
``Obviously, I'm very excited. It's been a long election night that
has gone from 24 hours to seven days, and we're delighted to have it
over with.''
   Mack had claimed victory Nov. 10 after absentee ballots gave him
a decisive lead.
   He got 2,048,458 votes to MacKay's 2,016,867 _ a lead of 31,591
out of nearly 4.1 million votes cast in the race, in unofficial
returns.
   MacKay dismissed suggestions he had tarnished his reputation by
refusing to concede earlier.
   ``One thing worse than sour grapes is rotten grapes and that's
what we would have had'' if some voters felt their votes were lost,
MacKay said, referring to his campaign's claim that up to 170,000
votes for the Senate race may have been missed in totals.
   He said he was making sure that Florida voters were protected,
which should only help his reputation.
   His campaign cited steep drop-offs from presidential to Senate
vote totals in four large counties. MacKay showed charts here
reporting that in 63 of 67 counties, there were more Senate votes
than presidential votes.
   After his narrow loss, MacKay said sharp drop-offs in the Senate
vote totals compared with other races could have indicated computer
problems.
   MacKay was unwilling to prolong his challenge, however, by filing
lawsuits to seek court-ordered recounts.
   The Mack campaign said a variety of other factors, including
voter apathy or indecisiveness, could be blamed for the drop-offs in
the Senate race.
   Palm Beach County officials did a spot-check of some precincts
Wednesday and found no evidence of the computer irregularities
alleged by MacKay.
   MacKay, accompanied by his wife, Anne, said he hadn't had time to
decide about whether he will ever seek an elective office again.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., remained in seclusion
Wednesday, refusing to comment on a request Tuesday by his
successor, political newcomer Craig James, to concede defeat. A
recount showed James won by 725 votes out of more than 250,000 cast
in the northeast Florida congressional district.

<TEXT>
   The National Economic Commission opened its
post-election attempt to break a seven-year deadlock on the budget
deficit with repeated warnings Wednesday that the deficit represents
the nation's greatest economic threat.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, one of the leadoff
witnesses before the bipartisan panel, said ``The deficit already
has begun to eat away at the foundations of our economic strength,
and the need to deal with it is becoming ever more urgent.''
   Greenspan joined other witnesses in saying that Congress and
President-elect George Bush must reach agreement quickly on ways to
slash the deficit or run the risk that foreigners will stop
financing America's borrowing needs.
   ``We must put our fiscal house in order so that we can address
the other problems which are important to us as a nation,'' said
Alice Rivlin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office.
``Getting the budget deficit behind us is a test of our ability to
govern.''
   The comments offered a sharp contrast to much of the debate
during the presidential campaign when both candidates sidestepped
questions concerning the deficit because they did not want to offer
detailed solutions.
   However, some of the witnesses said Bush, now that he is
president-elect, very well could be forced by events in financial
markets to seriously bargain with Congress or risk triggering a
free-fall in the value of the U.S. dollar.
   ``The rest of the world may well give up on the dollar if it
foresees four more years of towering twin (budget and trade)
deficits,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for
International Economics.
   Investors have been unusually jittery in the past week over
concerns that Bush's tough stance against new taxes and the larger
Democratic marjorities in Congress would translate into further
gridlock on solving the deficit problem.
   The dollar has come under heavy selling pressure since the
presidential election and that selloff continued Wednesday, putting
further downward pressure on U.S. stocks. The Dow Jones industrial
average plunged by more than 38 points, resuming a sharp decline
that began last week.
   A fall in the dollar sends U.S. stocks tumbling because investors
fear that interest rates will have to rise in this country to
continue to attract the needed foreign investments. Rising U.S.
interest rates reduce business prospects and raise threats of a
recession.
   Responding to the market concerns, Bush has pledged to make the
budget deficit a top priority. However, he has not indicated any
willingness to abandon his ``flexible freeze'' proposal by which
overall spending increases, excluding Social Security and interest
on the debt, would be held to the rise in inflation each year.
   While Bush's economic advisers have insisted that the country
could grow its way out of deficit problem without sharp spending
cuts or tax increases, Greenspan rejected such a notion. He
indicated that tough choices would have to be made on spending cuts
to get the deficit under control.
   But Greenspan supported the Bush contention that the deficit
should be reduced on the spending side rather than by boosting taxes.
   However, if spending cuts alone are not sufficient to narrow the
deficit, Greenspan said tax hikes should be considered because the
need to cut the deficit was so critical.
   ``How it is done is less relevant than that it be done,''
Greenspan said.
   The 12-member economic commission, chaired by Democrat Robert
Strauss and Republican Drew Lewis, was created by Congress a year
ago to come up with a blueprint for reducing the federal budget
deficit, which climbed to $155.1 billion in the fiscal year ending
last September.
   Supporters of the commission believe that it offers the best hope
of crafting a combination of tax increases and spending reductions
in such politically sensitive programs such as Social Security,
Medicare and defense which could be embraced by the new Congress and
the new administration.
   However, members of the commission, in interviews, emphasized
that much will depend on the final two members of the panel who will
be appointed by Bush and how much negotiating authority he gives
them.
   Lewis said the panel has scheduled further public hearings for
Nov. 30, Dec. 7 and Dec. 12 and at this stage had not ``reached a
consensus'' on any policy recommendations.
   But responding to reports that the commission was so divided that
it would be able to come up with a report, Lewis said, ``We are
determined to address this issue and we will be coming back with
specific recommendations for the next administration.''
   Another witness, former Labor Secretary William Brock, said the
commission should recommend boosting the gasoline tax, possibly
increasing it by 10 cents per year over 10 years, as a way of
raising $10 billion in new revenues each year and also cutting the
country's dependence on foreign oil.
   He said the commission also should support a national sales tax,
such as many European countries have adopted. He conceded that both
of these proposals would be politically painful.
   ``Granted this is not going to be politically palatable for a lot
of folks, but the reason we are here is that we spent the last
couple of decades adding one combination after another of aspirin,
Band-Aids, funny budgets, smoke and mirrors,'' he said. ``This
country is imperiled and it is going to take a whole lot of guts to
face this fact and deal with it.''

   Two convicted murderers working in a
West Virginia Penitentiary motor pool escaped Wednesday when one
stole a truck and crashed through a gate and the second followed in
a car, the warden said.
   The truck was abandoned a block away, and authorities said they
believe the two fled in the car, a gold sedan with a state
Corrections Department symbol on each side.
   Warden Jerry Hedrick said he believes the two fled to Ohio.
   ``The only reason we feel this was we had a report from a truck
driver who said he was almost struck by a vehicle fitting the
description of the ... car,'' Hedrick said.
   He said the near collision occurred on the Moundsville 12th
Street Bridge, which leads to Ohio.
   The escape occurred about 3:40 p.m. when the truck crashed
through a gate. The maintenance shop and motor pool area is outside
the 122-year-old prison's walls and is surrounded by a chain-link
fence, Hedrick said.
   Hedrick identified the escapees as Freddie Rakes, 29, and Dickie
Wimmer, 36.
   Rakes is serving a life term without parole on a first-degree
murder conviction and a 75-year sentence on a robbery conviction,
Hedrick said. He entered the penitentiary March 19, 1981.
   Wimmer is serving two life sentences, one without parole, for
first-degree murder convictions, he said. He had been in the state
prison since June 27, 1979.
   The two men were working in the state car motor pool, one as a
mechanic and the other on automobile bodies.

<HEAD>Feeding Tube Cannot Be Removed From Brain-Damaged Woman, Court
Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The parents of a brain-damaged woman
cannot have their daughter's surgically implanted feeding tube
removed so she can die as they believe she would want, the Missouri
Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
   ``We find no principled legal basis which permits the
co-guardians in this case to choose the death of their ward,'' the
court said in a 4-3 decision.
   ``In the absence of such a legal basis for that decision and in
the face of this state's strongly stated policy in favor of life, we
choose to err on the side of life, respecting the rights of
incompetent persons who may wish to live despite a severely
diminished quality of life,'' the court said.
   It was the first time the state Supreme Court had taken on a
right-to-die case and specifically ruled whether nutrition and
hydration ought to be construed as medical treatment that may be
discontinued if that is what the patient would want.
   The court's decision, which reverses a lower court ruling,
followed arguments in September on whether Joe and Joyce Cruzan
should be allowed to order the removal of the feeding tube providing
nutrition and hydration for their daughter, Nancy, a 31-year-old car
wreck victim.
   Legal experts say a key point is that the Supreme Court was not
being asked to decide whether Ms. Cruzan should die; instead, the
court was asked whether her parents, as her court-appointed
guardians, have the right to make that decision on her behalf.
   Doctors say Ms. Cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state
for five years. They say she could live another 30-40 years in her
present state through daily feedings of liquid protein and water
through the tube that is implanted in her stomach.
   The parents wanted doctors at the state-run Missouri
Rehabilitation Center to remove the feeding tube. When the hospital
refused, they sued last year in Jasper County Circuit Court. They
said their daughter indicated a year before her accident that she
would not want to live in the condition she is now in.
   Jasper County Circuit Judge Charles Teel ruled in July that the
feeding tube can be removed. He said the tube is medical treatment
because it was surgically implanted. He also ruled it was an
invasive medical procedure which can be refused by a patient under
the constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy.
   Under Missouri's living-will statute, a person can refuse medical
treatment. But it specifically excludes nutrition and hydration from
the definition of medical treatment because they are considered
basic necessities of life.
   Since the 1983 accident, Ms. Cruzan has been bedridden, unable to
swallow or to respond to her environment. Her hands and feet have
constricted and bent into claw shapes because of the brain damage
and her eyes constantly blink.

<HEAD>With AM-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab-Americans responded with pride and hope to this week's PLO
declaration of a Palestinian state, while a leading Jewish group on
Wednesday called the pronouncements in Algeria ``a phony gesture.''
   In Algiers on Tuesday, Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, declared an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital. He also said the organization was
renouncing terrorism and had endorsed key United Nations resolutions
on the Middle East, including one that partitioned British-mandated
Palestine into Jewish and Arab states.
   ``I am very excited, very happy and optimistic,'' said Sana
Ahmad, a Palestinian-American who attends classes at William
Paterson College in Wayne, N.J.
   ``I think more people now recognize this is not just an Israeli
problem but also a Palestinian problem,'' she said. ``People here
are questioning more, they're realizing that there are two sides to
the story.''
   In downtown St. Louis on Tuesday, about 200 people marched in
support of the declaration. Some carried Palestinian flags and wore
black-and-white checkered kafiyehs, Arab headdresses; others held
banners stating, ``Palestinian Statehood Now'' and
``Self-determination for Palestine.''
   ``We are here as Palestinian and Arab-Americans gathered to bless
and support the declaration of an independent Palestinian state. We
are for peace and prosperity for the whole region,'' said Dr. Z.A.
Dalu, chairman of the Arab-American Community Center of St. Louis.
   ``It is now up to the Israeli government to abide by U.N.
Resolution 242, which calls for independence and prosperity for
every state.''
   But in New York, the head of the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations said the Palestine National
Council's actions announced by Arafat amounted to smokescreens.
   ``I say it is a phony gesture. ... What we have here is a
declaration for propaganda,'' said Morris B. Abram, chairman of the
conference that represents 46 American Jewish organizations.
   The PLO announcement gives the ``impression of moderation on
behalf of a violent purpose.''
   He noted that Arafat declined to specify whether the PLO's
acceptance of the United Nations resolutions meant an explicit
acceptance of the Jewish state.
   The Palestine National Council, the parliament in exile, rejected
terrorism, but accepted guerrilla actions in Israel and the
territories it has occupied since the 1967 war, he added.
   ``This is a forecast of more terrorism to come _ and not only in
the so-called occupied territories,'' said Abram.

   Benazir Bhutto once recalled a day
nearly a decade ago when she visited her father in jail as he
awaited execution by the military regime that had toppled his
civilian government.
   ``I told him on my oath in his death cell, I would carry on his
work,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   Her father, former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged
in a Rawalpindi prison in 1979, two years after being convicted in a
murder conspiracy. Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who led the coup that
unseated Bhutto, turned down international pleas for sparing him.
   Today, three months after Zia died in a mysterious plane crash,
Ms. Bhutto is the undisputed star of Pakistani politics as head of
the populist Pakistan People's Party founded by her father.
   The charismatic 35-year-old Ms. Bhutto inherited the grass-roots
following that brought her father to power in the 1970s. In speech
after speech to adoring crowds, she has promised a better life to
the poor rural masses that form the core of this Islamic nation.
   Ms. Bhutto was groomed for politics, studying by the side of her
father, then focusing on politics and government while at Harvard
and Oxford.
   Her first taste of political success came at the British
university, where she was elected president of the Oxford Union
Society in 1976.
   Ms. Bhutto returned to Pakistan in early 1977 to take up a job in
the foreign office.
   The job was short-lived, however, as Zia toppled Bhutto's
government a few months later.
   Her father was accused of conspiring to murder a political
opponent and was sentenced to death. Ms. Bhutto turned to denouncing
Zia after her struggle to have her father reprieved failed. She
wound up in jail or under house arrest for five years.
   Not until a serious ear infection required treatment did Zia
allow her release in 1984 to go to England in self-exile.
   Ms. Bhutto returned triumphantly to Pakistan in April 1986, four
months after Zia announced an end to eight years of military rule.
She drew huge crowds as she toured the nation demanding democracy.
   Ecstatic crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands would
chant her name and wait for hours for a glimpse of her.
   The stunning comeback led to inevitable comparisons with Corazon
Aquino of the Philippines, who became president after a popular and
military uprising against Ferdinand Marcos.
   But Zia steadfastly refused to allow elections contested by
political parties. In the meantime, Ms. Bhutto surprised many
observers by agreeing to an arranged marriage last December with
Karachi businessman Asif Ali Zardari that followed strict Islamic
tradition.
   Six months later, Zia fired his civilian government. In July, he
set Nov. 16 as the date for new elections.
   There was considerable speculation that Zia, who died in an Aug.
17 plane crash, chose the date to coincide with the birth of Ms.
Bhutto's first child to keep her off the campaign trail.
   But the elections came two months after Ms. Bhutto gave birth to
a son, Bilawal, on Sept. 21, giving her time to make whirlwind
campaign tours throughout the country after a brief bout with a
kidney infection.
   In public, Ms. Bhutto is mindful of local custom and Islamic
morality, appearing with her head covered and wearing the baggy
Shalwar Kameez favored by most pakistani women. But she is clearly
Westernized, and is as comfortable speaking English as Urdu.
   Poised and articulate, she again captivated massive crowds almost
everywhere she traveled. In early November, she mounted a 38-hour,
31-stop railway tour aboard the green-and-yellow ``Khyber mail''
train that wound its way 1,000 miles through the country's
hinterland.
   Her voice deteriorated into a barely audible rasp as she preached
the Bhutto message handed down by her late father: democracy and
prosperity to the poor masses.

<HEAD>Official Vote Count Shows Wallop Won in Wyoming; Recount May Be
Asked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials verified on Wednesday U.S.
Sen. Malcolm Wallop's defeat of Democratic challenger John Vinich by
1,322 votes and they awaited Vinich's decision on asking for a
recount.
   After the state canvassing board confirmed the results of the
Senate race as well as Wyoming's U.S. House contest, the
presidential race and other races, a national Democratic leader told
Secretary of State Kathy Karpan that Vinich had not told him whether
he would ask for a recount.
   State law calls for an automatic recount if the victory margin is
less than 1 percent of the votes received by the apparent winner.
   The canvassing board's figures reveal Wallop collected 91,143
votes to Vinich's 89,821, putting the race outside the 911-vote
difference that would trigger a recount.
   Wyoming's election code allows candidates to request another
count of an election, but they must pay for the exercise.
   A recount would cost Vinich, a 38-year-old state senator, up to
$11,500. He has until Friday afternoon to file for a recount and
make a $100 deposit.
   Bob Chlopak, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, told Karpan that Democratic officials had no
doubt that Wyoming officials were careful in their election work,
but Vinich may want a recount anyway because of the narrow margin.
   Karpan, a Democrat, said she told Vinich in a conversation a few
days ago that if he has a ``shadow of a doubt'' about the election
results, he should ask for a recount.

<TEXT>
   ``Miami Vice,'' NBC-TV's stylish police
series, will not return for another season, the show's executive
producer said.
   ``It's the last year by our own election, so we're planning for
it,'' Michael Mann said recently.
   Sonny Crockett, played by stubble-faced Don Johnson, and Ricardo
Tubbs, played by the suave Philip Michael Thomas, will end their war
against drug lords come spring in a two-hour episode that will tie
up some of the show's loose ends.
   NBC would neither confirm nor deny that the show was going off
the air. ``We don't know if this is the last season,'' NBC
spokeswoman Pat Schultz said. ``We're still looking at options.''
   ``Miami Vice'' made its debut in September 1984 as an
MTV-influenced update of ``The Mod Squad'' and ``Police Story.'' It
updated the police genre and spawned several imitators, including
ABC's failed ``Hollywood Beat.''
   The high-energy show emphasizes rock music, pastel shades, fast
boats and a glitzy visual style. Its stories are set amid the
drug-traffic industry in Florida's sun-dappled Gold Coast.
   Widely criticized for its glamorous depiction of high-powered
firearms and the drug business, ``Miami Vice'' has slipped in the
ratings recently. Once a Friday night powerhouse, the one-hour show
now struggles to compete with ABC's ``20-20'' and CBS's ``Falcon
Crest.''
   The series was created by Anthony Yerkovich, who portrayed
Crockett as a vice detective with a lot of rough edges and Tubbs as
streetwise New York cop who moves South.

<TEXT>
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party pushed major
tax reform bills through the House of Representatives Wednesday, a
major step toward Japan's first overhaul of its tax system in 40
years.
   The bills now go to the House of Councillors, where approval is
expected within a week.
   Although the Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition group,
and the Communist Party boycotted the crucial House of
Representatives session, the Liberal Democrats, who hold a majority
in both houses of parliament, voted the bills through.
   The tax package was passed after government party members reached
a compromise with some opposition groups on a stock-trading scandal.
   But Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi complained the
government has not done enough to divulge details of the so-called
Recruit scandal, which opposition parties had used to try to stall
parliamentary action on the tax bills.
   ``The new tax bill is contaminated with the scandal. We won't
accept any offer from the LDP until it discloses the entire
scandal,'' Doi said.
   All opposition parties had boycotted parliamentary sessions since
Nov. 10, when the government pushed the tax package through the Tax
Reform Committee.
   But the governing party, in negotiations that lasted through
Tuesday night, got the Clean Government Party and the Democratic
Socialist Party to attend Wednesday's final session.
   The government in turn agreed to set up a committee to probe the
scandal.
   Late Tuesday it submitted to the new committee a list of senior
politicians and officials who bought unlisted shares in a subsidiary
of the information conglomerate Recruit Inc., and then profited by
selling them after the company went public in October 1986.
   The list included 26 aides and relatives of top politicians and
public officials such as Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. They have admitted the
transactions took place but denied doing any favors for Recruit or
that anything illegal occurred.
   Opposition legislators charged the list was inadequate.
   ``We all know there were many more buyers of the shares than
those 26 on the list,'' said Nanosuke Narazaki, an opposition
lawmaker from the United Social Democratic Party.
   The list said 114 other people who were not politicians or public
officials had also bought the shares but they were identified only
by occupation.
   The Liberal Democrats could have forced through the tax overhaul
even if all opposition parties opposed it. But it is a tradition of
the Japanese parliament to negotiate issues thoroughly until
reasonable compromise is reached.
   Takeshita put tax reform at the top of his priorities but
progress was slow as the opposition objected to measures in the tax
package and said the bills were tainted because the drafters
included people implicated in the Recruit scandal.
   The bills call for a reduction in corporate and personal income
taxes but also include an unpopular 3 percent sales tax on almost
all goods and services. The bills reduce the number of income tax
brackets from six to five and introduce a capital gains tax for the
first time on profits from share transactions.
   A study by a Tokyo consumers' cooperative has estimated the tax
plan would mean an annual saving of $800 for a typical four-member
household with an annual income of $53,500, but opposition parties
charge the new tax system favors the rich while ignoring low-income
households.

   The woman accused of abducting a newborn
baby pleaded innocent Wednesday by reason of mental disease or
defect and will be examined by psychiatrists on her ability to stand
trial.
   Acqunetta Rushon Smith, 32, was arrested at her Hot Springs home
on Monday after police received a tip from an anonymous caller.
   Capt. Bob H. Moore of the Little Rock Police said Tuesday that
Ms. Smith wanted to have a child by her boyfriend and that the two
``were very much wanting to have a baby boy.''
   Ms. Smith is charged with ``permanent detention or restraint'' in
the abduction of 3-day-old Christopher Michael Jones from Doctors
Hospital on Nov. 1. , said Chief Deputy Prosecutor Lloyd King.
   She had been charged with kidnapping, to which she pleaded
innocent Tuesday. The charge was changed Wednesday, King said,
because Arkansas law defines kidnapping as an abduction for the
purpose of holding someone for a ransom, as a hostage, or to hurt
the victim.
   Authorities said the premature infant was well taken care of
during the two weeks he was missing.
   The permanant detention charge, which involves holding or
concealing a person ``without ever releasing him, without ever
returning him to the person or instituation from whose lawful
custody he was taken,'' is a felony. Like kidnapping, it is
punishable by five to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $15,000.
   Ms. Smith will be examined by psychiatrists who will report to
Pulaski County Circuit Court on her ability to stand trial,
according to Bill Simpson, public defender. She pleaded innocent
Tuesday in Little Rock Municipal Court and was denied bond.
   Lisa Rutherford, a registered nurse, said in an interview that
Ms. Smith was a loving person and took care of her terminally ill
sister who died early this year.
   Mrs. Rutherford said she saw news of Ms. Smith's arrest on
television and couldn't believe she was charged with the abduction
because ``she seemed so level-headed.''
   Ms. Smith's sister, whose identify was not revealed because of
patient confidentiality, died early this year. Mrs. Rutherford would
not reveal the woman's illness.
   ``She (Ms. Smith) could have deserted her sister,'' Mrs.
Rutherford said. ``A lot of patients that come in here that have a
very bad illness, their families just totally turn on them.
   ``She could have done that easily but she didn't,'' said Mrs.
Rutherford, an assistant head nurse at the University of Arkansas
for Medical Sciences.
   Ms. Smith allegedly posed as a nurse and took Christopher from
the room of Annette Thomas-Jones. Mrs. Thomas-Jones and her husband,
Willie Jones, made several appeals to the abductor through the
media. A reward totaling $27,500 was offered for the child's safe
return. Police are to announce the disposition of the reward on
Thursday.
   Ms. Smith is divorced, has four children of her own and cares for
her sister's child.

   A man suspected of stealing an unmarked state
police car filled with weapons held police at bay for 1{ hours
Wednesday while threatening to hang himself, authorities said.
   Police were trying to serve a warrant for Andrew Kane's arrest in
the Nov. 8 theft when the suspect spotted the officers and ran down
a street about 2:30 p.m., Detective Edward Tenuto said.
   Kane ended up on the roof of a row house with one end of a rope
tied around his neck and the other around a pipe, Tenuto said.
   Officer William Ervin, one of three officers who helped talk the
29-year-old Kane into surrendering, said the suspect was worried
about charges in the theft case.
   Kane surrendered at 4 p.m. and was charged with auto theft,
receiving stolen property and weapons violations, police said.
   The unmarked state police car was stolen in Philadelphia while a
trooper visited relatives. In the trunk was a grenade launcher, tear
gas grenades, a submachine gun, a .357-caliber revolver, two
shotguns, ammunition and rappelling hooks and other equipment used
to scale buildings.
   The stolen car was used by Sgt. Charles Rogers, a member of the
state police's Strategic Emergency Team. Authorities said team
members normally carry the weapons and equipment in their cars
because they are on call 24 hours a day.
   City police found the car about two hours after it was reported
missing. The car's trunk had been forced open and the weapons were
missing.
   All but two shotguns and a handgun have been recovered, police
said.
   On Saturday, police arrested Kelsey Little, 18, of Philadelphia
in the case. Little was charged with buying the submachine gun,
receiving stolen property and possessing 20 vials of crack, police
said.

<TEXT>
   The main opposition party Wednesday ended its
fight to overturn the results of the July 6 election and said Carlos
Salinas de Gortari can legitimize his presidency by ensuring
democracy.
   The conservative National Action Party said however it still
maintained that Salinas, of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, won the presidency in a fraudulent election.
   Abel Vicencio Tovar, National Action Party secretary general,
told a news conference that Salinas should begin his term on Dec. 1
with ``a transition to a real democracy.''
   Vicencio Tovar said the president-elect could ``legitimize
himself before the Mexican people with the just exercise of his own
power'' and by ``respecting the popular mandate of democratization,
pluralism, social justice and national sovereignty.''
   It was the first time that a major Mexican opposition party
publicly accepted Salinas' victory. National Action's presidential
candidate, Manuel J. Clouthier, previously had called upon President
Miguel de la Madrid to annul the election results and appoint an
interim president until a new ballot could be held.
   According to the Federal Election Commission, Salinas won with
slightly more than 50 percent, the slimmest margin of victory in the
ruling party's 59-year history. Presidential candidates fielded by
the governing party traditionally have won with at least 70 percent
of the vote.
   The PRI, as the ruling party is known has not lost a presidential
election since its founding in 1929.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front
coalition came in second with 31 percent and Clouthier finished
third with 17 percent, according to the governing party-dominated
commission.
   Vicencio Tovar released a National Action Party statement
demanding that Salinas' administration initiate ``a peaceful and
civilized evolution toward social and political coexistence, based
on respect of the human, social and political rights of all Mexicans.
   ``In this way, we will advance toward a more just, free,
participative society in which pluralism is an integral part of the
state structure,'' the statement said.
   Saying National Action had adopted a position as ``a responsible
democratic opposition,'' the statement also outlined policy demands
for the new president, including fixing foreign debt service
payments to a percentage of export revenues, capping the growth of
the $104 billion foreign debt, support for small businesses, better
living conditions for farm workers, and conservation of national
resources.
   The party also called for a revision of Mexico's election code to
ensure fraud-free elections.

   Singer Peggy Lee _ whose hits have asked the
questions ``Why Don't You Do Right?'' and ``Is That All There Is?''
_ demanded answers Wednesday as she announced the filing of a
lawsuit against Walt Disney Productions.
   Miss Lee, who co-wrote the lyrics and performed songs and voices
for Disney's cartoon classic, ``Lady and the Tramp,'' said she
hasn't received any money from the movie's considerable
videocassette sales.
   She told reporters at a Manhattan news conference that she only
received a little over $4,000 for her original work on the 1955
movie.
   In a $25 million lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County
Superior Court, she charged that Disney has ignored a 1952 contract
provision that barred the company from making ``phonograph
recordings and-or transcriptions for sale to the public'' without
her consent.
   Her attorney, Alvin Deutsch, said that provision applied to
videotapes. But he acknowledged that Disney maintains that
``transcriptions'' referred only to sheet music.
   Tania Steele, director of publicity for Disney video, said, ``We
can't comment on litigation.''
   Miss Lee said she noticed the contract provision only after she
helped Disney promote the videotape version of ``Lady and the
Tramp,'' which she said has sold more than 3{ million copies.
   In the movie, she said, she played the voices of Peg the dog, two
Siamese cats and the human mother referred to only as Darling.
   Miss Lee, 68, She said she received a $500 honorarium for her
promotional work. ``My hairdresser makes more than that,'' she said.
   When she approached Disney about getting a cut of the movie's
profits, she said, ``I was ignored in a polite way, like, `Go away,
kid, don't bother me.' ... Considering the circumstances, it was
rude.''

   Nicaragua on Wednesday called
the Reagan administration's Central America policy a failure and
urged President-elect George Bush to formulate a new one based on
dialogue and mutual respect.
   The Nicaraguan position was expressed in a speech to the
Organization of American States General Assembly by Carlos
Tunnerman, Nicaragua's ambassador to the OAS.
   Tunnerman served as ambassador to the United States until he was
expelled by Washington in July in retaliation for the leftist
Sandinista government's expulsion of U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton
and seven other American diplomats.
   ``The failure of U.S. policy in the (Central American) region
should make the new U.S. authorities reflect and should inspire them
to construct a new era of relations with the region,'' Tunnerman
told OAS delegates.
   ``Threats and the use of force should be proscribed forever.
Intervention should cease. Concepts of zones of influence or
strategic reserves should be abandoned ... reason should prevail
over force and dialogue over pressure,'' he said.
   Since 1981, the Reagan administration has supported Nicaraguan
rebels known as Contras in their bid to overthrow the Sandinistas.
U.S. military aid to the Contras expired in February, and most of
the rebels fled to Honduras.
   The Sandinistas and Contras signed a cease-fire agreement in
March, but talks on a permanent truce broke down in September.
   Meanwhile, Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras told
the OAS assembly that he and his counterparts from Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica would meet in Mexico on Nov. 30
in an effort to breathe new life into the stalled Central American
peace process.
   In Guatemala, President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo on Wednesday said
he would press for a summit meeting of Central American presidents
before Bush is inaugurated on Jan. 20.
   Cerezo said the summit agenda would include the re-establishment
of a verification commission to monitor compliance with a regional
peace plan signed in August 1987. Other topics could include forming
a Central American parliament and environmental issues affecting the
area.
   The Central American presidents had considered meeting later this
month to further define the peace plan.
   The pact, by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, seeks to end wars
in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala and was signed by those four
countries and Honduras.

   Actress Robin Givens filed a $125 million libel
suit Wednesday against her estranged husband, heavyweight boxing
champion Mike Tyson, for allegedly telling a newspaper that she was
trying to steal his money.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, accused Tyson
of holding Givens, 23, up ``to public contempt, ridicule,
embarrassment, disgrace and prejudice.''
   The latest swing in the marital punchout between Tyson and Givens
stemmed from a Nov. 7 New York Post article that quoted Tyson as
saying Givens tried to ``steal'' his money and property.
   The Post was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, which
described the article as ``false, defamatory, malicious and
libelous.''
   The New York Post had no immediate comment.
   Tyson and Givens, married Feb. 12, have filed for divorce. He is
suing her in New Jersey and she is suing him in California.
   The lawsuit, filed by New York divorce lawyer Raoul Lionel
Feldberg, seeks $25 million for damages and injury and an additional
$100 million in ``punitive, compensatory and special damages.''
   ``I think it's funny,'' Tyson manager Bill Cayton told The
Associated Press.
   ``The lawsuit is outrageous and ludicrous,'' said Howard
Weitzman, Tyson's lawyer. ``This young lady once again is attempting
to shift blame from her conduct to someone else and blame them for
any problems she perceives she's having. ...
   ``What Mike said in the Post interview he believed to be true
based on the fact that Robin refused to give to his lawyers books
and records relating to his money that she misrepresented to the
public when she said she did not want any money, when in fact she
had at first demanded $8 million and then reduced it to between $1{
to $2 million.''
   Among the Tyson quotes in the Post article that angered his wife
were lines such as: ``She manipulated me ... Now it turns out she
was lying when she said she didn't want anything from me.''
   The article also quoted Tyson as saying: ``The nature of those
two women (Givens and her mother, Ruth Roper) is to be mean and
vindictive. She said she wants nothing, but she refused to sign a
release.''
   Also: ``And she (Givens) stole money from me when we were
together.''
   Givens also claimed that during the same period he was talking to
the Post, Tyson was calling her so often ``that she was forced to
disconnect her telephone.''

   Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov warned
Wednesday that deploying a Star Wars strategic defense system could
tempt a pre-emptive attack against it and trigger nuclear world war.
   Sakharov delivered his stark message at a dinner honoring Dr.
Edward Teller, the U.S. physicist often dubbed the father of the
American hydrogen bomb who is a strong advocate of deploying a
space-based nuclear missile defense system.
   It was the first meeting between the two and Sakharov, winner of
the Nobel and Albert Einstein peace prizes, used it to emphasize his
differences with Teller and to say that the world could be on the
doorstep of significant arms control efforts if Star Wars is not
allowed to stand in the way.
   Sakharov, the Soviet Union's most celebrated human rights
activist, told a black tie audience of some 750 people in a hotel
ballroom that he has great respect for Teller and believes he is a
man of conviction and principle.
   But he said he strongly disagrees with Teller on the issue of
deploying the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star
Wars.
   ``I consider such a system to be a great error,'' Sakharov said.
``I feel it would destabilize the world.''
   Enormous costs would be incurred by deploying an American
defensive system and by creating a new Soviet offensive system to
counteract the shield, he said.
   ``If such systems are deployed ... there would be a temptation to
destroy them, and this in itself could trigger a nuclear war...,''
Sakharov said. ``SDI is one of the problems that stands in the way
of achieving really deep and profound arms control.''
   In a reply, delivered after Sakharov's departure, Teller
portrayed the Soviet physicist as ``a great man'' who nonetheless is
out of touch with technological advances in space defense, including
developments in the Soviet Union which he said is further ahead in
the field than is the United States.
   ``I am not sure he has realized yet what our president has
envisioned,'' Teller said.
   He said that in announcing the SDI five years ago Reagan asked
that a space-based defense use non-nuclear weapons if that proved
possible.
   ``And year after year it turns out it looks better and better,''
Teller said. ``We are seeing developments coming from many sides.''
   He said he remains convinced that ``we must know what can be
known,'' about the defense system. ``We must find out whether it
will work.''
   But he said that he and Sakharov have no argument on one score.
   ``You have heard his ideas about a peaceful future,'' he said.
``He wants peace. I want peace. Every one of us wants peace. There
is no possible difference on that one.''
   Sakharov, 67, who is on a three-week U.S. visit, spent years of
internal exile in the Soviet city of Gorky due to his human rights
activities. He met Monday with President Reagan and Wednesday with
President-elect George Bush.
   The award to Teller, presented by the Ethics and Public Policy
Center, was accompanied by a citation which said that Teller's motto
```Better a shield than a sword,' expresses a timeless truth.''
   Sakharov noted that he and Teller for years had led their lives
``on a parallel course'' in their countries' nuclear weapons
development programs.
   ``I was involved in the work on thermonuclear weapons,'' Sakharov
said, his words translated by an interpreter. ``I was completely
convinced that this work was essential, that it was vitally
important.''
   He said that while he had not fought in World War II, ``the work
in which I was involved was also a kind of war.''
   Sakharov said this was the case because similar work was being
carried out in the United States where ``the American scientists
regarded it with the same feelings, that it was vital for the
interests of the country,'' and for maintaining peace through
nuclear deterrence.
   ``But ... I think what we were doing at that time was a great
tragedy,'' he said. ``The tragic state of the world made it
necessary to maintain the peace of the world and to do such terrible
things. At least at the time we were doing it we were convinced this
was the best way to maintain the peace.''
   Sakharov said that with the Soviet Union's new policies and
progress being made by both sides on arms control, the world has
entered a new era and new approaches are necessary. He said there
are issues on which he and Teller agree, including assuring the
safety of nuclear energy.
   It is important that the two superpowers are able to talk out of
their disagreements on the Star Wars issue, he said, adding, ``At
least we will understand each other's point of view and be able to
talk instead of creating a situation of confrontation.''

   President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, the leading man and woman in the Western World's
conservative revolution, shared ``sad thoughts'' and flowery
tributes on Wednesday as the closing curtain descended upon their
eight-year partnership.
   The British prime minister also took the opportunity during her
White House visit to greet President-elect George Bush, saying the
Western alliance was ``very fortunate'' to have him as Reagan's
successor.
   ``That brings enormous stability and confidence to the feeling of
the world,'' Mrs. Thatcher told reporters as she sat next to Reagan
during an Oval Office photo session.
   Asked for his reaction to their meeting, Reagan told reporters:
``Sad thoughts, that this will be the last time that we shall meet
in this capacity.''
   Mrs. Thatcher called the session ``special for us,'' and
reminisced about how they'd first met, prior to taking office, in
1977. ``We had the same political dreams and the same ways of
achieving them ... so there are lots of times to recall,'' she said.
   While the prime minister said she also was saddened by the end of
their formal relationship, both leaders pledged to keep in personal
contact and to work to keep the ``great alliance'' between the two
nations intact under the new administration.
   After lunch at the State Department and other meetings at Blair
House, the prime minister was scheduled to return to the White House
for a state dinner, the last such formal event of Reagan's
presidency.
   During their dinner toasts, Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher both cited
the words of Winston Churchill.
   The president noted that Churchill had often praised America's
ability ``to use its resources for the good of the world'' and said
the admiration is deep ``on both sides of the Atlantic.''
   ``She is a leader with the vision and the courage to stay the
course until the battles are won,'' Reagan said. ``The impact of
Mrs. Thatcher's leadership at home and abroad secures her place in
history.''
   ``As I prepare to depart this office in January, I take
considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher
will stil reside at No. 10 Downing Street,'' Reagan added.
   The prime minister, also quoting Churchill, said, ``As long as
our people act in absolute faith and honor to each other, and to
other nations, they need fear none and they need fear nothing.''
   She praised Reagan as ``more than a staunch ally and counselor.
You have also been a wonderful friend to me and our country.''
   Mrs. Thatcher saluted as well the first lady, whose ``charm,
dignity and quiet but sure courage have won the hearts of millions.''
   She also paused, saying she wanted to ``warmly congratulate''
Bush and his wife Barbara on his recent election, saying she looked
forward ``to working with you as a true and trusted friend.''
   In a London-like drizzle, Mrs. Thatcher was accorded an arrival
ceremony with full military honors, which included a formal review
of troops, a parade by the Fife and Drum Corps in Revolutionary War
garb, and a thumping 19-gun salute.
   As Reagan stood by her side, Mrs. Thatcher hailed his presidency
was ``one of the greatest in America's history.''
   ``Thanks to your courage and your leadership, the fire of
individual freedom burns more brightly, not just in America, not
just in the West, but right across the world,'' she said.
   ``Together our nations have faced the challenges of our time, and
have not flinched. We forged ahead with strengthening the peace,
spreading prosperity and safeguarding liberty,'' said the prime
minister.
   No other world leader has shared the special friendship with
Reagan that Mrs. Thatcher has, given their shared anti-Communist
ideology, their distaste for the welfare state, their absolute faith
in free markets and a strong defense.
   Reagan, in his remarks, lauded Mrs. Thatcher for her
``extraordinary role in the revitalization of freedom,'' saying she
has contributed to a ``remarkable change'' in her country through
policies that encourage individual creativity.
   Looking beyond his own term of office, Reagan added, ``It is
profoundly reassuring to me and to all who care about freedom that
you will continue to share with American your vision and your steady
hand.''
   At the welcoming ceremonies, Mrs. Thatcher greeted Bush and his
wife, Barbara, smiling and stopping to chat a bit as she shook hands.
   Bush did not take part in the two leaders' 30-minute Oval Office
meeting but did join talks attended by Secretary of State George
Shultz and other top officials from both governments on a wide range
of international problems.
   Rozanne Ridgway, the assistant secretary of state for European
affairs, told reporters afterwards Bush did not take an active part
in the discussion, listening for the most part as various topics
were brought up.
   ``There was some mention when we got to the environment where we
all, everyone in the room nodded, and the vice president certainly
nodded on that,'' she said, evoking a round of laughter from
reporters.
   But the official explained that the session ``was a meeting
between the president and the prime minister ... Most people in the
room didn't speak.''
   British-American relations have been reinvigorated during the
Reagan-Thatcher years. Reagan came to Mrs. Thatcher's aid during
Britain's 1982 war with Argentina in the Falkland Islands. Four
years later, Mrs. Thatcher allowed American bombers bound for Libya
to take off from British bases and was alone among NATO leaders in
openly supporting the U.S. attack.
   While Reagan must step down, Mrs. Thatcher, 63, who is now the
West's longest serving leader, faces no such constraints. Her
present tenure lasts another four years, and she has said she will
seek a fourth term in the 1990s.
   Mrs. Thatcher was last here in 1987 and was also one of the first
foreign leaders to meet with Reagan after he took office in 1981.
   She is the first leader to stay in the newly renovated 19th
Century mansion Blair House, the official White House quarters
located across the street on Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Mrs. Thatcher is scheduled to have talks with Shultz before
flying home on Thursday.

   The Massachusetts Supreme Court on Wednesday
unanimously threw out regulations that would have banned AIDS
testing for health insurance and other forms of coverage.
   Its decision, the court said, was based solely on the question of
the insurance commissioner's authority and ``has nothing to do with
the substantive merits of the (AIDS-testing) regulations or with the
need for their adoption.''
   ``We conclude that the (insurance) commissioner had no authority,
express or implied, to adopt the regulations challenged in this
case,'' Justice Herbert P. Wilkins wrote for a unanimous court.
   The court said it was up to the Legislature to decide whether to
give the insurance commissioner such authority.
   ``I am very pleased with the decision,'' said William Carroll,
executive director of the Life Insurance Association of
Massachusetts, which along with several insurance companies appealed
the regulations. ``We felt that the authority issue was the most
critical issue of the case.''
   Denise McWilliams of the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders
group, which intervened in support of Insurance Commissioner Roger
Singer, said the result will be that ``it is going to make it
impossible ... for people to get insurance, particularly those
individuals who are just (tested) positive.''
   Beyond that, she said, ``I think the long-term effects can be
truly staggering, because, obviously, if folks can't get private
insurance, they are going to be thrown onto the public rolls. I
frankly don't think that's fair to anybody's interest.''
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis called the decision ``a setback for our
efforts to deal responsibly with the issues of AIDS testing and the
use of AIDS-related information for life and health insurance.''
   ``I continue to believe in the need for regulations that are
reasonable to the industry and fair to those they insure,'' he added.
   Singer issued the regulations on Sept. 11, 1987, making
Massachusetts only the second state, after New York, to ban by
regulation health insurance testing for antibodies to the human
immunodeficiency virus associated with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Only California and the District of Columbia have passed laws
banning AIDS testing for health insurance.
   Under the Massachusetts regulations, AIDS testing would be banned
for all health insurance, any group life and most disability
insurance. Testing would be allowed under controlled conditions for
individual life and non-cancellable disability insurance.
   The regulations said that insurance companies who wished to test
must offer no-test policies of up to $100,000 with an AIDS
exclusion. Companies could also offer any policy with a no-test AIDS
exclusion which could later be removed if the individual
policyholder furnished proof of a negative test for the AIDS
antibody.
   The regulations never went into effect because of the insurance
industry's appeal.

   With their 55th _ and final _ state dinner on
Wednesday, President and Mrs. Reagan closed the book on one of their
favorite White House events, one for which they rekindled a
tradition of glitz and glamour dating to John Adams' New Years Day
bash in 1801.
   Though most presidents have made the White House a stage for some
of the nation's most elaborate and exclusive entertainment, the
Reagans brought back a Hollywood party style to an executive mansion
shorn of hard liquor and dancing during the Carter years.
   Mrs. Reagan, asked as her guests arrived why British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher was the honoree for their final state
dinner, responded, ``Because she was our first (guest) and we love
her.''
   During their dinner toasts, Mrs. Thatcher saluted the first lady,
saying her ``charm, dignity and quiet but sure courage have won the
hearts of millions.''
   She also praised the president as ``more than a staunch ally and
counselor. You have also been a wonderful friend to me and our
country.''
   Reagan said the prime minister ``is a leader with the vision and
the courage to stay the course until the battles are won. ... As I
prepare to depart this office in January, I take considerable
satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher will still
reside at No. 10 Downing Street.''
   The first lady was attired in a red satin ball gown while Mrs.
Thatcher wore a pink two-piece dress with gold edging and buttons.
Mrs. Reagan also wore a brilliant, multistone necklace that appeared
to be made of diamonds and sapphires, but her spokeswoman, Elaine
Crispen, described it as ``definitely costume.''
   Wednesday night's black-tie tribute to Mrs. Thatcher was an apt
finale to a glittering series in which Reagan, now 77, never seemed
to tire, regaling his guests with anecdotes, both at the dinner
table or while working the after-dinner demitasse crowd in the Blue
Room.
   And after an evening's entertainment _ ranging from the Dance
Theater of Harlem to Wednesday's pianist, Michael Feinstein _ the
first couple virtually never failed to take a near-midnight turn
about the marbled dance floor while their guests lingered over
champagne.
   Mrs. Thatcher was the first foreign leader to be honored by the
couple at such an event, which took place on Feb. 26, 1981, a month
after Reagan took office.
   ``We've come quite a long way and done quite a lot together,''
Mrs. Thatcher reminisced during an Oval Office tete-a-tete with the
president. The president and Mrs. Thatcher also held formal talks
several hours before the evening's festivities. Mrs. Thatcher's
husband, Dennis, was also an honored guest.
   The two leaders _ soulmates of staunch conservatism _ spent a
good part of the day trading laudatory statements about the success
of their eight-year alliance.
   But despite the prime minister's usually patrician demeanor, the
farewell day was a time to have a bit of fun, as well.
   At a State Department luncheon of monkfish and venison, Secretary
of State George Shultz presented Mrs. Thatcher with a black patent
leather handbag, saying he'd grown used to seeing her pull perfect
compromises from her bag ``like a rabbit out of a hat.''
   While President-elect George Bush was invited in his No. 2
capacity, Vice President-elect Dan Quayle was not on the evening
guest list.
   White House aides scrambled to explain that Quayle had been
invited to a dinner in 1982 as part of the normal congressional
contingent and that he'd be going to many, many more such events
after the change in administrations.
   Members of Congress invited to Wednesday's dinner included Reps.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., and Tom Foley, D-Wash., as
well as Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., Ted Stevens, R-Ala., and Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va.
   While the Reagans have shown a preference during their years in
office for guests from Hollywood, the arts and the world of fashion,
they have also included sports stars and representatives from
academia and captains of industry.
   Wednesday's guest list also included American Ballet Theatre
artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov, Discovery space shuttle
commander Frederick Hauck, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Orel
Hershiser, actor Tom Selleck, New York City Opera general director
Beverley Sills, the Rev. Billy Graham and author Tom Wolfe.
   Traditionally, some 120 guests are invited to the executive
mansion, where they are treated like royalty from the moment they
are greeted by military aides and the elegant strains of a harpist
at the East Wing entrance.
   They are treated to before-dinner drinks, a formal reception line
with the guests of honor, and a five- or six-course meal. Given the
Reagan's pride in their home state, California wines normally are on
the menu.
   For the fete honoring Mrs. Thatcher, the State Dining Room was
turned into a garden of peach roses, with hundreds of the flowers
gathered in topiary trees on each table and arrayed in bouquets
around the room.
   The guests, dining on the famed $200,000 red Reagan china, were
served baby lobster in a caviar yogurt sauce; roasted saddle of veal
perigourdine; asparagus with hazel nut butter; autumn mixed salad
and a selection of cheeses, as well as chestnut marquise with
pistachio sauce, orange tuiles and ginger twigs.

   A Jewish civil rights group expressed concern
Wednesday about John Sununu, whom sources say has been tapped to be
White House chief of staff, because of his failure to support a
measure that condemned an anti-Zionist U.N. resolution.
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith issued a statement
saying Sununu, the retiring governor of New Hampshire, was the only
governor who refused to endorse a proclamation attacking a 1975 U.N.
resolution that equated zionism with racism.
   At a news conference in Concord, N.H., Sununu, who is
Arab-American, said he did not endorse the proclamation sponsored by
Zionist groups because it would have been inappropriate.
   ``I have said very clearly that it was inappropriate for a
governor to try to issue something that would have as its focus an
attempt to influence foreign policy,'' he said.
   But he said that he made sure that the condemnation of the U.N.
resolution found its way into the Republican Party platform at the
national convention last summer. Sununu was President-elect George
Bush's liaison to the GOP platform committee.
   ``So I don't have a problem supporting that in the proper
context,'' he said.
   Sources have said Bush has picked Sununu to be the chief of
staff. Bush has not made a formal announcement, and Sununu has not
confirmed or denied the reports.
   The ADL, in a statement from its New York office, said that
Sununu was the only governor out of 50 not to endorse the
proclamation, ``a position which put him at odds with President
Reagan, Vice President Bush and both Houses of Congress.''
   Despite its criticism of Sununu, the ADL said the governor has
issued proclamations commemorating Israel's 40th anniversary and
efforts on behalf of Soviet Jewry.
   ``As chief of staff, Gov. Sununu will bear a major responsibility
for facilitating the implementation of the new president's program
and policies as reflected in the Republican Party platform. We hope
and trust he will meet the responsibility,'' the ADL statement said.
   Bush, asked about some criticism of Sununu from Jewish leaders,
defended the New Hampshire governor as being sensitive to Isreali
concerns.
   ``Sununu is practically the author of the best party platform on
the Middle East that any party has ever had,'' the president-elect
said.
   Bush, however, would only shake his head and laugh when asked
when he would announce his choice for chief of staff.
   Sununu said he had ``no problem in stating rather clearly'' that
he believes a key to peace in the Middle East is the ``assurance of
the integrity and protection of the state of Israel.''
   President Reagan, asked for his view on the reported asignment of
Sununu to the chief of staff post, praised his record as governor.
   ``I have great admiration for him _ I've seen him as governor and
what he's done ... he's a great governor and if that's what turns
out (that he becomes chief of staff) he'll do a remarkable job,''
Reagan said.
   The president added that Bush has not asked any advice about
possible appointments, but that he would gladly offer it if asked.

   They were neighbors, schoolmates and friends and
between them, they had one sound heart.
   ``The first thing that went through my mind is that a friend of
mine is dead,'' 18-year-old Maria Ortiz said Wednesday from her bed
at the University of Illinois-Chicago Hospital, where she is
recovering from heart transplant surgery after receiving a surprise
gift _ the heart of a friend.
   ``Now I've got a chance ... and I'll be real happy because I know
the girl and I know most likely how she was and I'll feel better
than having a stranger's heart in me,'' she said.
   ``At least,'' she added, ``I knew her.''
   Ms. Ortiz lived all her young life with a weakening heart muscle.
After an attack late Nov. 4 or early Nov. 5, she was brought to the
intensive care unit at Illinois Masonic Hospital, where doctors
feared she had only days left to live.
   Ms. Ortiz began to accept that she might never see her
4-month-old daughter grow up. In a waiting room nearby, her mother,
Carmen Geliga, struck up a conversation with another woman whose
daughter was in the same unit with a neurological disorder that had
left her brain dead, but with a healthy heart.
   Ms. Geliga had no idea then that their daughters had exchanged
greetings at the neighborhood pool and talked occasionally in the
halls at Roberto Clemente High School before Maria dropped out.
   ``I wanted to ask her, but I couldn't, because it seemed very
cruel to come out and say, `Please, give us her heart,''' Ms. Geliga
recalled.
   Instead, she went home and prayed. When she returned to the
hospital, Ms. Geliga learned the woman had asked to speak with her.
   ``I had sorrow for her because she was losing her daughter and
it's hard to accept because her daughter was leaving and mine was
going on me also. ... Then she just says to me, `I want to donate my
daughter's heart so that your daughter can go on living.'''
   ``One minute we didn't have anything,'' Ms. Geliga said. ``The
next minute, we had everything.''
   Both girls were moved to the University of Illinois Hospital,
where the operation was begun late Nov. 6 and completed early Nov.
7, said hospital spokesman Michael A. Maggio.
   Neither Ms. Ortiz nor her mother knew the donor was a friend
until other friends of the two teen-agers made the connection.
   Doctors have pronounced the transplanted heart ``an excellent
match,'' and say Ms. Ortiz' chances for survival are promising.
   Candace Wiberg, organ procurement coordinator at the hospital,
said doctors bypassed a state protocol for chosing a recipient from
among all eligible patients because the donor's mother ``likely
wouldn't have donated it unless she knew Maria would get it.''
   Organ rejection remains a concern, but medical literature suggest
Ms. Ortiz's chances of survival are 80 percent or better through the
first year and 60 percent or better through five years.
   ``They're probably better than that,'' said Dr. Sidney Levitsky,
head of cardiothoracic surgery at University of Illinois Hospital.
``In recent years, better anti-rejection drugs have improved the
chances of survival.''
   Ms. Ortiz says she has occasional bouts of sadness over her
friend's fate, and promises one of her first trips when she returns
home will be to visit her friend's mother.
   ``I will try to be just like a daughter to her because I have
part of her daughter in me,'' she said.
   Ms. Ortiz might find additional comfort in the story of Donna
Ashlock, a Patterson, Calif., girl who nearly three years ago
received a transplant from a high school admirer. Felipe Garza, who
was 15 at the time, died of a brain hemorrhage after telling his
parents he wanted Donna to have his heart.
   Ms. Ashlock has been hospitalized several times for episodes of
organ rejection. But with medication and a diet modified to lower
cholesterol and salt intake, she has gone on to live a normal life.
   Ms. Ortiz hopes to do the same.
   ``I'll go swimming, bike riding and do lots of things I couldn't
have done before,'' she said, ``and really enjoy my life.''

   Leftist guerrillas blew up a farm truck
carrying highland peasants and sent it tumbling down a mountain
ravine. Eleven people were killed, four of them children, police
said Wednesday.
   Seven other passengers on the paneled, flat-bed truck were
wounded, police said. They blamed the attack on the Shining Path
guerrilla movement.
   Rebels detonated dynamite buried beneath a gravel road as the
truck passed, seeking to kill four policemen who they thought were
aboard, police said.
   ``We made a mistake. They're not police. Let's get out of here,''
a survivor said, quoting one of several armed guerrillas who swarmed
over the wreckage moments after the attack late Monday.
   Police said the four officers had gotten off the truck a few
minutes before the blast on a major road near Quinua, a town 20
miles northeast of Ayacucho.
   The truck was carrying several Indian peasant families from
Ayacucho to nearby villages and farms. Farm trucks are frequently
used in place of buses to carry passengers throughout Peru's lofty
Andes Mountains, where paved roads are rare.
   The region surrounding Ayacucho, 230 miles southeast of Lima, is
the heart of the Shining Path's eight-year insurgency to impose
Marxist rule.
   The area is also the bloodiest. The government says the majority
of the 12,000 people slain during the insurgency have been Ayacucho
peasants caught in the crossfire between rebels and government
forces.
   In related violence, police said two policemen and one guerrilla
were killed Wednesday in two separate Shining Path attacks along
Peru's northern coast.
   Guerrillas in a passing car shot and killed a policeman as he
climbed aboard a city bus in Trujillo, a coastal capital 350 miles
north of Lima, police there said.
   In Carabamba, a village 30 miles east of Trujillo, a column of
100 rebels launched a dawn attack against a police post manned by 20
officers. Police said one policeman and one attacker were slain in
an hour-long firefight before the rebels were driven off.

   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by 17 percent
to $10.5 billion in September, the government said Wednesday, but
not enough to prevent a new assualt on the dollar over worries about
what the head of the Federal Reserve called a ``dangerous
corrosion'' of the American economy.
   Exports rose by $700 million to a record high $28.2 billion, the
Commerce Department said. Imports declined by 2.5 percent or $1.1
billion to $38.7 billion from a record high in August. The $10.5
billion trade gap for September was down by $1.8 billion from the
revised August trade deficit figure of $12.3 billion.
   But neither change was big enough to stem a new selling wave of
dollars by traders worried about inflation from an overheating
economy and skeptical of President-elect George Bush's promise to
reduce the federal budget deficit through a ``flexible freeze''
without any tax increases.
   The dollar, resuming its downward path of last week, fell nearly
1 percent against the Japanese yen to 122.24 yen despite what
currency traders said was intervention by the Fed to prop it up
through massive purchases of dollars using yen. The figure was the
lowest close against the yen in New York trading since modern
exchange rates were established in the late 1940s. The dollar also
fell 1.5 percent against the West German mark.

   Barend Strydom, the 23-year-old arrested after the shootings,
quit the national police force in February while facing misconduct

   Four men and two women were killed in the midafternoon shooting
spree Tuesday, and 16 people _ 15 blacks and one Asian _ were
wounded. Witnesses said the gunman laughed as he fired at his
victims with an automatic pistol from close range over a 15-minute

   ``I could never shoot a white man,'' the gunman reportedly told
officers who drove him away as angry blacks surged around a police

   Talk-show host Oprah Winfrey's weight loss of 67
pounds has spurred new interest in liquid diets, but experts said
Wednesday many people should avoid such diets and nobody should try
them without medical supervision.
   ``These were not made for the majority of dieters who want to
lose 10 or 15 pounds,'' said Mary Lee Chin, a Denver consulting
dietician and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association.
   Winfrey, 34, announced on her show Tuesday that she had lost the
weight in four months through a supervised liquid diet program, and
that a cheeseburger was the only solid food she had eaten since July
7.
   Chin said liquid diet programs should be considered only by
people who are above their weight by 20 percent to 30 percent, or by
at least 50 pounds, or whose weight poses a medical risk. And a
liquid diet should be considered only after conventional diets fail,
she said.

<HEAD>AIDS Victims Illume A Truth About Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the complexity of life, AIDS victims tell a
truth about it. Challenging modern illusions of immortality, they
illuminate a universal reality _ that death comes to all.
   Their suffering also can be ``a means of grace for them and
others,'' says the Rev. David Felter of Kansas City, Mo., who helped
initiate a special selection of Scripture for AIDS patients.
   ``If the sufferer can accept God's acceptance of himself, he is
free, liberated, to offer his own suffering under God as a
sacrament,'' Felter said in a telephone interview.
   ``If he accepts that reality, not with the acquiescence of
defeat, but with a triumphalness of spirit, we see something ugly
but nevertheless inevitable changed from a final enemy to a doorway
to a new and better existence.''
   Indications of that enlightening assurance that can come through
difficulty run through a small booklet of Scripture passages issued
by the American Bible Society to help in coping with AIDS.
   Called ``Nothing can separate us from the Love of God,'' the
booklet includes 22 passages from the Old and New Testament, such as
the 23rd Psalm, which reads in part:
   ``Even if I go through the deepest darkness, I will not be
afraid, Lord, for you are with me.''
   It is regarded the first time, nationally, that a special
collection of Bible passages has been issued to bolster the spirits
of those stricken with AIDS, presently incurable and always fatal.
   ``Who then can separate us from the love of Christ?'' says Romans
8. ``Can trouble do it, or hardship or persecution or hunger or
poverty or danger or death?... No, in all these things we have
complete victory through him who loved us.''
   The passages are in the simplified translation of the ``Good News
Bible'' in today's English, emphasizing God's backing in the worst
times of helplessness, abandonment and fear.
   ``You threw me down into the depths, to the very bottom of the
sea, where the waters were all around me,'' reads Jonah 2. ``But
you, O Lord my God, brought me back from the depths alive.''
   The idea for the booklet grew out of a consultation of
denominational representatives at which Felter, long-time pastor and
now training coordinator for the Church of the Nazarene, cited the
need for such material.
   Telling of a couple whose son was stricken with AIDS, he said,
``This kind of thing hurts so much, and we've been ill equipped to
provide any kind of real strengthening in these cases.''
   The project for the booklet resulted. Chaplains and others who
work with AIDS patients reviewed the manuscript and expressed
approval of passages chosen.
   ``Jesus... answered, ... `I have not come to call respectable
people, but outcasts','' reads Matthew 9.
   The booklet is being made available to hospitals, hospices,
church groups and individuals who minister to people with AIDS.
   ``We despised him and rejected him; he endured suffering and pain
... we ignored him as if he were nothing,'' go verses in Isaiah 53
and 52. Yet many ``will see and understand something they had never
known.''
   Felter said that in ``our death-denying society,'' AIDS ``remind
us of our finitude, of our temporariness, that we are indeed like
vapor that appears and then is gone.
   ``These events teach us that there is no circumstances, no
situation regardless of how hopeless, that cannot in the grace of
God be transformed into a window for the spirit whereby we see
reality more clearly.
   ``Suffering and awareness of others' suffering sharpens our
perceptions of life.''
   He said AIDS victims can find grace for themselves and others in
their plight through realizing their acceptance by God.
   ``In a sense, they can take what is loathsome, ordinary and
deadly and transform it into a window that allows us to see beyond
the ordinariness threatening us all,'' he said.
   He said it models ``in a small way'' what Jesus did in the
resurrection after his crucifixion, ``transcending hopelessness, the
sentence that is against them,'' and opening a ``changed perspective
of life forever.''
   Interspersed among the Bible passages offered for AIDS sufferers
are brief commentaries stressing God's constant devotion to the
rejected and weak and forgiving compassion for human failure, such
as:
   From Psalm 103 _ ``As for us, our life is like grass. We grow and
flourish like a wild flower; then the wind blows on it, and it is
gone... But for those who honor the Lord, his love lasts forever.''
   From 2 Corinthians 4 _ ``Even though our physicial being is
gradually decaying, yet our spiritual being is renewed day by day.''
   From 1 Corinthians 15 _ ``Listen to this secret truth: ... when
the last trumpet sounds, we shall all be changed in an instant, as
quickly as the blinking of an eye... For what is mortal must be
changed into what is immortal.''

   President Reagan, in a message for observance
of National Bible Week, Nov. 20-27, says the Bible ``is the most
precious treasure yet entrusted to man.''
   ``Over the centuries, though empires have risen and fallen,
though civilizations have ebbed and flowed, the Bible has remained a
constant source of hope and inspiration,'' he says.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, are honorary national chairpersons of
the week, an interfaith project emphasizing importance of the Bible
and promoting greater reading of it, including daily passages
recommended for the week.
   Reagan says the Bible ``shaped the ideas and formed the
consciences of many early Americans'' and nurtured ``a profound
belief in human dignity, in individual freedom and in the
inalienable rights of man...
   ``Unless we ... insure that the wonderful treasures of the Bible
are handed down to each new generation, we cannot, I believe, long
remain a `nation under God.'''

   Three wild turkeys wandered into a
residential neighborhood for a look-see and apparently decided to
settle in, abandoning their creekside roosts for utility poles and
front porches in this little Nebraska town.
   Townspeople say the birds seek out human companionship. They
commonly chase joggers and walkers and greet youngsters as they walk
to school.
   Ruby Ebsen says they visit her house every day.
   ``I think they are looking to see if I will come out and give
them some corn,'' she said. ``If I don't, they go on.''
   Last July, eight or nine turkeys began forays into this town of
2,500 people on the Nebraska-Kansas border. The birds came from a
wooded area along a creek that bounds Superior on the west, but the
three who stayed have taken to spending their nights atop utility
poles and their days on porches or cars.
   ``They have really made themselves at home,'' Lorraine Rempe
said. ``They sit on top of our house, or on the patio rail. ...
   ``If they see you in the yard, they come right up and one seems
to be the spokesman _ he gobbles first.''
   The gobblers have been content to stay within city limits, a
smart thing to do during turkey hunting season, which ended Veterans
Day. But two weeks ago, one of the birds was wounded with a pellet
gun. Police are investigating because it's illegal to shoot pellet
or BB guns in town. The wounded turkey is recovering at the home of
a local dentist who raises guinea fowl and other birds.

<HEAD>Asylum or Deportation for Joe Doherty?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KEARNY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Joe Doherty broke out of a maximum
security prison in Northern Ireland seven years ago, the Irish
Republican Army's underground network of safehouses and sympathizers
led him to this working class, Irish-American suburb of New York.
   Doherty had been convicted with three others of killing a British
army officer in a 1980 shootout.
   In Kearny, he lived with an American girlfriend, worked in
construction and took a part-time job at Clancy's Bar in Manhattan.
   ``It was sort of like being normal for once ... having a job and
knowing you're not going to get assassinated or stopped in the
streets because of your religion,'' Doherty said in a recent
interview at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.
   On June 28, 1983, a group of FBI agents walked into Clancy's,
ordered a round of beers and took him into custody again.
   Since then, the case has grown to involve the the White House,
the Justice Department, civil rights activists, and the leaders of
Great Britain and Ireland.
   Doherty doesn't deny being involved in the killing but says it
was a political act and that he warrants political asylum in the
United States.
   The government disagrees. The Justice Department calls Doherty a
terrorist and says he should be deported to Britain.
   ``The question of who gets political asylum and who is a refugee
should be based on the law, on facts and on circumstances,'' said
Mary Pike, Doherty's lawyer. ``But the question really depends on
which government you're fleeing. If it's a government with which the
Reagan administration wants to remain friendly, then you can't get
asylum.''
   ``If I was a Cuban,'' said Doherty, ``there's no way I would be
deported.''
   Doherty, a bachelor, has spent the better part of his 33 years in
hiding or in prison. He joined the IRA in 1969 after the British
army crushed a Catholic civil rights march on what has become known
as Bloody Sunday.
   ``I'd watched my father live his life as a second-class citizen,
and tell me to learn a trade and then emigrate,'' said Doherty. ``I
didn't want to tell my son at 17 that he had to go to Canada to find
a job because of his religion.''
   While lawyers debate his case, Doherty has spent the past five
years in a 12-foot-by-6-foot cell at the federal prison in New York.
   ``I see this case as a complete rejection of the Constitution by
the government,'' said Paul O'Dwyer, a civil rights attorney in New
York. ``There is no other prisoner I know of who has been held for
such a protracted period of time having committed no crime in the
United States.''
   Tom Moseley, a former Justice Department attorney who handled the
Doherty case, said the bottom line is that Doherty is a terrorist
who killed someone.
   ``We felt he should have been extradited to the U.K. on the
grounds of murder and assault,'' said Moseley, now in private
practice in Morristown.
   Some who sympathize with the IRA's goal of uniting the Republic
of Ireland with the northern six counties that make up the British
province of Northern Ireland consider Doherty a folk hero.
   The Justice Department went to court last year to stop
Philadelphians from naming Doherty honorary grand marshal of their
St. Patrick's Day parade.
   ``Free Joe Doherty'' graffiti adorns walls and sidewalks all over
New York City. At a New Jersey bar not far from where Doherty lived,
his picture hangs alongside that of Bobby Sands, the IRA prisoner
who starved to death during a 1981 hunger strike at a British prison.
   Among Doherty's supporters are New York's Roman Catholic
Archbishop Cardinal John O'Connor, Amnesty International, the
American Civil Liberties Union and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who
visited Doherty in prison in July.
   But there also are influential forces fighting for Doherty's
extradition.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the case in talks
with President Reagan during a 1986 visit to Washington.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., described the jailed IRA man as ``an
Irish Ghengis Khan.'' Lugar led a successful fight to exclude the
political exception clause from the century-old U.S.-British
extradition treaty when it was renegotiated in 1986.
   The British government filed a formal request for Doherty's
extradition in 1983. It was denied in December 1984 by U.S. District
Judge John E. Sprizzo in Brooklyn, who ruled that Doherty's crime
was a political act and qualified the defendant for political asylum.
   The government appealed and U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight
decided in Doherty's favor. A government appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York upheld Doherty's previous victories.
   Having failed to extradite Doherty, the Justice Department began
deportation proceedings.
   Since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent,
Doherty chose the independent Republic of Ireland and his decision
was upheld by immigration Judge Howard I. Cohen in 1986.
   ``If I was sent back to Ireland, I would be arrested and put in
jail,'' Doherty said. ``But hopefully it would be a humane place and
I would get a fair hearing, not like in the north.''
   The administration, this time through the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, appealed Cohen's order and again lost.
Another appeal and another government defeat followed.
   Meanwhile, the Republic of Ireland, under pressure from London
and Washington, in December 1987 ratified the European Convention on
Terrorism, which calls for mandatory extradition of those deemed
terrorists. That eliminated Doherty's Irish option.
   Today, Doherty is pinning his hopes on winning asylum, though
after 5{ years of court battles, he isn't too optimistic about his
chances for freedom.
   ``I go to court. I win,'' he says. ``But here I am.''

   Coonskin caps and flubber may make comebacks
as NBC revives ``Davy Crockett'' and ``The Absent-Minded Professor''
for a new round of shows from Walt Disney Productions.
   The two shows will be part of a ``wheel'' of rotating series,
specials and classics from the Disney library on NBC's Sunday night
``The Magic World of Disney.''
   ``Davy Crockett'' makes its debut Sunday with a two-hour movie of
new adventures of the popular frontiersman. Tim Dunigan dons the
coonskin cap to star as the ``king of the wild frontier.'' Johnny
Cash plays Crockett as an elder statesman.
   The following Sunday, Harry Anderson of NBC's ``Night Court''
stars as Professor Henry Crawford, the forgetful inventor of
lighter-than-air flubber, in a one-hour episode of ``The
Absent-Minded Professor'' based on the two movie comedies from the
early 1960s starring Fred MacMurray.
   ``Those two shows will appear regularly, and we're looking for a
third action-adventure,'' said executive producer William Blinn, who
wrote the ``Davy Crockett'' movie.
   Although the third rotating element hasn't been decided, one
possibility going into production in January is ``Mountain Man,'' a
contemporary adventure similar to the popular ```Crocodile' Dundee''
movies. It has not yet been cast.
   In ``Mountain Man,'' a trapper who has spent most of his life
away from civilization inherits a big-city newspaper and fortune.
   ``Davy Crockett'' as a television series was a sensation on ABC's
``Disneyland'' in 1954-55. ``Disneyland'' was the sixth
highest-rated show that sason, and it wasn't long before kids
everywhere were sporting coonskin caps and singing its popular theme
song, ``The Ballad of Davy Crockett'' _ ``Davy, Da-a-a-vy Crockett,
king of the wild frontier!''
   Fess Parker played Crockett. Buddy Ebsen was his sidekick, George
Russell. Disney filmed three episodes, making the mistake in the
last of killing off Crockett at the Alamo. Crockett was brought back
to life by popular demand and several more episodes were made.
``Davy Crockett'' was actually television's first miniseries. In
subsequent years, Disney aired such miniseries as ``The Saga of Andy
Burnett,'' ``The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca'' and ``Texas John
Slaughter.''
   In the current storyline, Crockett fights in the Creek Indian
Wars in Alabama. ``The Ballad of Davy Crockett'' will be sung in the
new shows, but only briefly, and Gary Grubbs plays the role of
George Russell.
   ``We brought back `Davy Crockett' because the character is warm,
likable and adventurous,'' said Blinn. ``He was a peculiar
combination of raconteur and adventurer. To some degree he was a
charlatan, I suppose.
   ``But in the 30 years since the first shows, we've become much
more aware of ourselves. Crockett will make mistakes, he'll have a
broader vision and he'll have a more responsible attitude toward
minorities. We're not giving him 1988 sensibilities, but he will
have a greater appreciation of gray areas and ambiguities.''
   Blinn said one of the difficulties of the new show is keeping the
wholesomeness of the Walt Disney name but making it more
contemporary in attitude.
   ``We're going up against `21 Jump Street,' a show that deals with
teen-age sexuality, abortion and drug pushers,'' he said. ``If
that's being offered on another channel, we can't confine ourselves
to, `Gee, they're tearing down the soda fountain, Dad.'''

   Before the end of 1988 gets much closer,
financial advisers say, it's a good idea to check on whether you
have been paying the right amount of federal income tax.
   That advice holds not only for people with large incomes and
complicated investments, but for everyday wage-earners who haven't
checked lately on the progress of their income and withholding taxes.
   The idea is simply to determine whether you have paid too much or
too little so far toward the eventual bottom line on the tax return
that will be due April 15.
   If the answer is too little, you may be in danger of incurring
interest charges and penalties from the Internal Revenue Service.
   If the answer is too much, you may want to consider asking your
employer to reduce your withholding tax for the last few paychecks
of the year.
   Less withholding now will reduce the size of the refund you stand
to collect next spring. That may not appeal much to people who use
overwithholding as a type of ``forced savings'' plan.
   But if you are going to be due the money a few months from now,
why not collect it sooner and put it to work for you, rather than
leaving it ``on deposit'' with Uncle Sam at no interest?
   Perhaps the extra take-home money in December might help you to
pay for holiday gifts and activities without having to borrow at
high credit-card interest rates.
   The exercise of calculating the status of your tax payments does
not have to be especially complicated. But experts on the subject
say it needs to be done with care to avoid a misstep.
   Many people can start with their most recent pay stub, which
should give them a pretty good idea of what their total wages and
salaries will be for the year.
   If your other income and deductions, such as investment interest
received and mortgage interest paid, has not changed drastically
since last year, you can use the numbers on your 1987 return as a
basis for estimating what your 1988 taxable income will be
(remembering that some deductions, such as for consumer interest
expense, will be less generous for 1988).
   Then you can compute your projected 1988 tax liability using the
tax tables for the year, which may be available from your employer,
a financial institution where you do business or your local library.
   If it looks as though your withholding is going to fall short by
a significant amount, further action may be warranted.
   To avoid penalties and interest, the rules require that your
withholding (and any quarterly estimated or other advance payments)
satisfy one of two standards.
   It must equal either 100 percent of what you owed for 1987, or 90
percent of the total that will be due for 1988.
   Suppose you had a windfall this year, substantially increasing
your taxable income, and you find that you are not likely to satisfy
either of those tests.
   ``If you're able to adjust withholding, you can solve the
problem,'' says William Brennan, an adviser on investment and tax
planning with the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney.
   ``Just arrange with your employer to withhold the amount needed
to `catch up.' Withholding is deemed to have been paid in evenly
throughout the year, no matter when it's actually withheld.
   ``In this way, you may be able to avoid interest and penalties
entirely.''
   Another way to close the gap: Step up you deductible activities,
such as charitable contributions, to reduce the amount of income
that will be subject to tax.

<HEAD>Taxing `Income' That Isn't Income</HEAD>

   Nobody in recent years has been able to
demonstrate that taxes are fair. The claim is made _ every time the
tax laws are changed, in fact _ but the proof isn't provided.
   Is it right, for example, to impose big tax burdens on young
singles who have few items to deduct? Should corporate dividends be
taxed twice, as they are? Do homeowners really deserve the tax
shelter they have?
   Almost anyone can compile a list of ``inequities'' in the tax
laws. They write to Congress, and Congress then rearranges the tax
laws. It has done so every year of this decade, closing loopholes,
opening others.
   And next year, if President-elect George Bush follows through on
campaign indications, Congress may be asked to deal with an aspect
of the tax law that many people consider to be not just inequitable
but just plain foolish.
   It is the tax on income that never was made, on buying power that
never existed, on funds that the person taxed never had the use of.
It is the capital gains tax which, as it exists, taxes a person for
inflation.
   For example, assume an investment of $5,000 in stocks has been
held seven years. If the appreciation averaged 10 percent over that
time you will have approximately doubled your money. Your capital
gains would be $5,000, your tax about $1,400.
   While you might appear to have earned 10 percent in current
dollars, you really would have earned only 6 percent a year. Why?
Because the value of the dollar changed. Inflation probably eroded 4
percent a year.
   At 6 percent a year your money will not double in seven years. It
will grow only to around $7,000. Nevertheless, you will pay capital
gains taxes as if it had grown to $10,000. You will pay $1,400 in
taxes.
   Deducting the taxes from the inflation-adjusted total amount
earned will leave you with just $5,600 _ an average gain of $100 a
year or less for having invested your savings in the American
economy.
   As the law exists, capital gains _ which are long-term gains and
thus vulnerable to inflation _ are taxed at the same 28 percent rate
as ordinary income, which suffers relatively little from inflation.
   It is for reasons such as this that Bush mentioned the
possibility of pushing back the capital gains tax rate, which was
raised in the 1986 tax reform measure. But there is more to it than
the inequity.
   The repercussions of the current level of capital gains shows up
every day in the securities markets, where individual investors
refrain from buying stocks and opt instead for the lower risk of
interest-bearing bonds.
   Paying taxes on money never earned isn't restricted to the
securities markets. In fact, the most common abuse of common sense
occurs in the taxing of capital gains ``earned'' on the inflated
value of personal residences.
   In this latter instance, however, homeowners are accorded various
tax benefits that offset some of the damage. In most other
investments, however, there is no relief.
   In such investments, the investor simply pays taxes on ``income''
that was never made.

   The older television grows, the more juvenile it
becomes.
   Delirious in a fact-based fever, TV sets are boiling over with
playground pranks and True Detective docudramas. From Geraldo
Rivera's scuffle with wanna-be Nazis to the slow-mo misdeeds on
``America's Most Wanted,'' television has rarely been so revolting
and so riveting at the same time.
   The new splurge of reality programming has critics shaking their
heads and viewers crowding living room sofas. And as long as the
ratings soar, a whole lot more truth-is-stranger-than-fiction series
will be hurtling your way.
   Which is why reality champion Fox Broadcasting Co. is riding high.
   ``I do think we're on to something,'' said Barry Diller, Fox's
chairman and chief executive officer. ```The Reporters' is not a
carbon copy of anything else. ... And I think `America's Most
Wanted' is an honestly moving show.''
   In fact, these shows owe a lot to previous programs: ``The
Reporters'' can be seen as merely ``60 Minutes'' on a caffeine jag,
the crime shows as simply borrowing from the headlines more directly
than did ``Hill Street Blues'' or ``St. Elsewhere.''
   Imitators are lining up. NBC has added ``Unsolved Mysteries'' to
its schedule, CBS started ``High Risk'' and ABC has resurrected
``That's Incredible'' and added the trilogy of ``Scandals,''
``Crimes of the Century'' and ``Trackdown.''
   Meanwhile, television syndicators are pounding the pavement for
``On Trial'' ``Group One Medical,'' ``Tabloid,'' ``Exclusive,''
``Crimewatch Tonight,'' ``Crime Diaries,'' ``$Reward$'' and ``Inside
Edition.''
   The popularity springs from a cast of characters more varied and
bizarre than any sitcom.
   In one corner are the hyperactive talk-show hosts _ Rivera with
his broken nose and the cluster-bomb of Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey
and Sally Jessy Raphael with all of their needling queries. These
four ask the questions we only dream about posing.
   The other corner is filled with the marginally less egotistical
``journalists'' who would recreate the John Kennedy assassination if
there were a rating point in it.
   Led by Maury Povich on Fox's syndicated ``A Current Affair'' and
its rape and murder replay show, ``America's Most Wanted,'' the key
here is to sit the audience down next to the corpse, smack in the
middle of the crime scene.
   Wherever reality programs fail in subtlety and substance, they
click in thrills and ratings. Costing a fraction of traditional
comedies and dramas, these unpredictable programs have in some
instances doubled Fox's audience share _ 15 percent of the nation's
sets tune in ``America's Most Wanted.''
   Overall, the audience is clearly substantial: Rivera, nose broken
but self-importance intact, is soaring from publicity generated from
his talk-show brawl and his NBC hit ``Devil Worship: Exposing
Satan's Underground.''
   Rivera, the carnival barker of television journalism, even went
so far as to slap a promotional teaser on the slugfest edition of
``Geraldo'': ``Parents, be advised that the language and violence
contained makes this show inappropriate for small children.'' In
other words, kids, watch this!
   Why are audiences lapping it up?
   ``American television viewers are tired of watching the most
inoffensive programming,'' said Kevin Wendle, executive vice
president of Fox's entertainment division. ``They have said, `We
don't want another network. Give us something different.' And we're
pulling out all the stops.''
   And how. Mixing sometimes sensational celebrity gossip and lurid
crime stories with first-person journalism, ``The Reporters''
doesn't just penetrate the ``fourth wall,'' it runs through it into
your home.
   Future Fox shows may be even more personal. Among ideas in the
hopper for Fox's third night of programming (planned for Mondays
sometime next year) is ``Cops,'' a graphic documentary series about
a group of Florida police officers making arrests and handling dead
bodies.
   Another Fox program in development will try to build on detective
magazines, with private eyes talking up their most interesting cases
with the help of video recreations.
   ``They (Fox) have shown that there's an insatiable thirst for
real life among the television viewing audience,'' said Rivera.
``They are filling a void that the networks are leaving. ... I think
that `America's Most Wanted' has really hit a nerve. It's populist
TV at its most pragmatic.''
   So much flotsam clogs the reality genre that some players are now
trying to rise above it all.
   Nick Clooney, host of the courtroom highlight show ``On Trial,''
recently sent reporters a letter saying, ``By some unimaginable
stretch of probabilities, a few writers equate such programs as
`Geraldo' and `Morton Downey Jr.' with `On Trial.' Nothing could be
further from the truth!'' The letter was mailed one day after an
``On Trial'' publicist asked that the show be included in any
upcoming stories on tabloid television.
   As with most anything else, too much of a good thing can be
risky. If the reality-based programming crumples overnight, so, too,
might Fox.
   ``While it's great now, we'll be careful,'' Diller said. ``If
we're not very careful about the diet, we'll make terrible
mistakes.''

<TEXT>
   Anna Ido Thamos waves a limp clover-like weed
in one hand and with the other displays sorghum mash, residue from a
local beer factory.
   Often boiled weeds and sorghum mash are all she has to feed
herself and her seven children. Some days, they do not eat at all.
   ``It is miserable,'' the 36-year-old nurse said as the tropical
dusk fell over several hundred people waiting to receive grain at a
food distribution center in this provincial capital beseiged by
rebels fighting Sudan's government.
   The grain is part of 1,500 metric tons of food being airlifted
into Juba in an emergency United Nations Operation from Entebbe,
Uganda, and a Norwegian Church Aid airlift of 150 metric tons from
Nairobi, Kenya. It is the first food to Juba since September when
the remnants of a truck convoy carrying relief food from Uganda
limped into town following a rebel attack that killed 15 people,
mostly Kenyan drivers and assistants.
   The airlifts may be the last chance of survival for the people
here in southern Sudan, caught up in the conflict between the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army led by John Garang and the
government, 750 miles north in Khartoum, say local government,
church and relief officials.
   ``Garang is a southerner and the people here are southerners so
the central government is not interested. They want everyone to die
of hunger,'' charged Francis Luate, deputy director of information
for Equatoria province.
   However, rebel activity has made the lush food-producing
countryside uninhabitable, forcing people into Juba where the
displaced and the townspeople alike now must rely on international
aid.
   ``The rebels claim to be fighting to liberate the people, yet
they are committing atrocities, raping and killing,'' Luate claimed.
   The rebels took up arms against the Moslem-dominated government
in 1983 seeking greater autonomy and economic reforms for the
predominantly Christian and animist south and the lifting of the
country's Islamic laws in the area.
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Paulino Lukudo Loro accuses the
government of deliberately withholding food aid in an effort to
depopulate the south and rob the rebels of their base of support.
   ``This is a clear plan of extermination of the south,'' said
Loro. ``It is really genocide going on.''
   Loro points to the government's ability to continue airlifting
arms and ammunition to its soldiers in Juba.
   ``Why is it not using military planes to bring food here?''
   The situation is worse in Torit, 50 miles east of Juba, where the
army recently made five airdrops of food and supplies to troops but
nothing to the people, according to a radio message from the town's
relief committee.
   The committee urgently requested an airdrop for the 4,000 people
living in the besieged town.
   ``The civilians are left to eating only leaves and waiting to be
buried,'' it said in message to the Norwegian Church Aid office in
Juba.
   Both rebels and government soldiers have placed landmines on the
footpaths and roads around the besieged towns, cutting off the
region's lush, green fields where crops remain unharvested.
   Small stocks of vegetables are available in Juba's markets, but
they are insufficient for the town's population which has swelled
from 150,000 to more than 200,000 with people from the embattled
southern countryside who fled to camps on Juba's outskirts.
   Predominantly Arab merchants continue to get supplies on
government-chartered flights from Khartoum but sell food at prices
well beyond the means of most. Before the airlift began, for
example, a 12-pound bag of maize (corn) was selling for the Sudanese
pound equivalent of $340.
   However, the grain being airlifted is not enough, said Sam Kenyi,
head of the Combined Agencies Relief Team, a consortium of relief
agencies and churches in Juba. The emergency operation allows the
estimated 50,000 refugees in the camps around Juba each 200 grams
(seven ounces) of maize a day. A third of the relief grain has been
allotted to cooperatives in town where wage-earners like Ms. Thamos
can buy up to eight pounds at most once a week.
   Death rates have been rising since September with as many as 400
hunger-weakened people, mostly children, dying each month in the
town's two hospitals, said Dr. Oliver Duku, project leader of
African Medical and Research Foundation and U.S. Agency for
International Development.
   Nobody is sure of the countrywide death toll since the fighting
began. But foreign relief officials in Khartoum and Equatoria's
Episcopal Archbishop Benjamin Yugusuk estimate at least 250,000
people have died of starvation or inadequate medical care since late
last year.
   About 2 million people, a third of the south's population, have
been turned into refugees by the fighting, about 1.3 million of whom
were forced from their homes this year, they say.

<HEAD>The High-Spirited Mr. O'Toole Returns To The Screen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter O'Toole was 15 minutes late for a lunch
appointment, and he needed a cigarette.
   ``I'm dying for a smoke,'' said the tall, gaunt actor, as he
swept into a crowded French restaurant in central London, removing
his hat with a flourish. ``I've been so virtuous.'' He asked the
maitre d' for a pack of his favorite brand, pungent French Gauloises.
   He sounded like the matinee idol he has played and parodied
on-screen, and was in the proper mock-ebullient spirits to promote
his new movie, ``High Spirits,'' which opened last week in the
United States.
   ``I love playing people who have got relish to life, a firm
identity in not being part of the herd,'' said the actor, whose
character, Peter Plunkett, furthers a line-up of O'Toole eccentrics
ranging from Lawrence of Arabia to the schizoid Earl of Gurney in
``The Ruling Class.''
   ``High Spirits'' casts O'Toole as an heir who inherits a
decaying, haunted Irish castle. Daryl Hannah (``Splash') plays the
castle's comeliest ghost, and Steve Guttenberg (``Cocoon'') and Liam
Neeson (``The Good Father'') head the supporting cast. The movie is
directed by the Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, who made the low-budget
hits ``Mona Lisa'' and ``The Company of Wolves.''
   Equipped with his cigarettes and an alcohol-free Bloody Mary, the
actor settled down to a salmon trout. The vegetables went untouched.
At 56, he remains as gaunt and chisel-faced as when he shot to
international stardom in 1962 as T.E. Lawrence, the mysterious
English desert warrior, in David Lean's brilliant Academy
Award-winning epic, ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   O'Toole said ``High Spirits'' marked a welcome change from the
demands of his most recent screen role as tutor to the Emperor Pu-Yi
in Bernardo Bertolucci's Oscar-winning ``The Last Emperor.'' It was
a cameo role that nevertheless stole the moment, as O'Toole always
manages to do.
   ``One's always looking for something different from what one did
the last time, and if a funny role comes up, it's very nice to do,''
he said. ``Having just played classic O'Toole in China, which was
not exactly a bundle of laughs, along came this rather potty film.
There was a gentleness I rather liked _ a sweetness, an amiability.''
   He described Plunkett as ``a down-at-heel aristo(crat), someone
who absurdly is hanging on to this enormous pile of stone at all
sorts of costs.''
   Plunkett is the latest in a versatile career that has seen seven
Oscar nominations for performances ranging from Henry II opposite
Katharine Hepburn's Eleanor of Aquitaine in ``The Lion In Winter''
(1968) to the enigmatic film director Eli Cross in ``The Stunt Man''
(1978) and the hilariously self-absorbed actor Alan Swann in ``My
Favorite Year'' (1982).
   However, the actor reserves special affection for ``Lawrence of
Arabia.'' The movie will be re-released shortly with 20 minutes of
lost footage restored, an act of reclamation that pleases its star.
   ``It's a magnificent film, part of film history,'' said O'Toole,
who worked with the celebrated Lean and the screenwriter Robert Bolt
to facilitate the restoration. ``When Sam (Spiegel, the original
producer) died, David went truffling (hunting) and found 20 minutes
that had disappeared without any rhyme, reason or symmetry.''
   It will now be more than four hours long, and O'Toole is
delighted: ``To go back to the epic vision is splendid. That was
what was great fun about `Last Emperor.'''
   Irish-born and English-bred, O'Toole followed the same theatrical
apprenticeship as others of his generation who made it in Hollywood,
such as Albert Finney, the late Richard Burton and Alan Bates.
   His long stage career includes playing Hamlet at the opening of
the National Theater in 1963, and doing a Macbeth in 1980 that was
so reviled by critics that it played to packed curiosity-seeking
audiences at the Old Vic.
   He left his Broadway debut until last year, when he played
Professor Higgins in George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion.'' He and Val
May's production received mixed marks, but he likes New York's
attitude to GBS, his hero.
   ``It was such a relief to go to a country where he was
respected,'' O'Toole said. ``They (audiences) saw the humor and the
situations coming around the corner, so it was like a breath of
great fresh air.''
   O'Toole rarely gives interviews, and he laments the British
press' fascination with his private life: his lengthy, victorious
battle against booze, and his bitter custody dispute over his
5-year-old son Lorcan, which is Irish for Lawrence.
   ``It's lazy copy,'' he said wearily. ``The press got a few good
stories in the '50s and '60s, and they keep it going. It seems I
don't change but the copy does.''
   Having finished lunch, O'Toole looked at his watch and hurriedly
picked up a folder of papers from the floor.
   ``I've got to float,'' he said.
   And with that, the lanky star was gone.

<HEAD>David Crosby Makes Up for Lost Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Crosby stops talking in the middle of a
rapid-fire sentence and sets his eyes on a bothersome fly buzzing
about in the living room of his San Fernando Valley home.
   He takes his hand from his portly stomach and moves toward the
fly which bounces off the plate glass window inches behind him.
   Smack. Silence.
   A few years ago, Crosby _ a member of the rock groups the Byrds
and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young in the 1960s and '70s _ would not
have cared if the fly had crawled all over him, as long as it didn't
disturb his drug stash.
   ``It's like being on a greased bannister that turns into a razor
blade,'' he said of his 20-year addiction in a recent interview.
``You are going to die. It was just the most horrifying experience
of my whole life.''
   Crosby, 47, has remained clean for more than two years after a
stint in a Texas prison. The story of his addiction, arrests,
imprisonment and recovery with girlfriend and now wife Jan Dance
will be told in the Doubleday book, ``Long Time Gone,'' written with
Crosby's friend, writer-director Carl Gottlieb.
   ``We didn't just use people saying nice stuff about me. We used
adversary interviews with people,'' Crosby said.
   Crosby also reteamed with Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil
Young for ``American Dream,'' on Atlantic records, the first album
since 1970's ``Deja Vu'' to feature all four.
   ``If there was any criticism you could level at `Deja Vu,' it
would be that it seemed we added Neil Young to some Crosby, Stills
and Nash and some Crosby, Stills and Nash to some Neil Young,'' he
said. ``This time Neil was an integral part of it from start to
finish, and it came out much more like an organic whole.''
   Crosby said the group has kept its fussiness intact over the
years, with the album mixed and finished more than once. Crosby's
solo album on A&M Records is due this winter.
   The Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young both blended the
sounds of country, folk and rock, along with political consciousness
and harmonious vocals.
   The Byrds' version of ``Turn! Turn! Turn!'' and Bob Dylan's ``Mr.
Tambourine Man'' became standards featuring Crosby's high voiced
harmonies. From collaborations with Stills, Nash and Young came
``Teach Your Children,'' ``Woodstock'' and ``Suite: Judy Blue Eyes''
   With his trademark green cape and enticing good looks, Cosby was
a Sunset Strip sultan as he made the club rounds in the '60s with
his entourage and lots of drugs.
   ``At first it was just a little snort, a little puff, you know.
But I had a ton of money. Whatever I've done, I've done to excess,
so I did it to excess and it absolutely started to put me away,''
Crosby said.
   But by the early '80s his body had swollen through years of drug
abuse and his face grew ruddy and scabbed.
   ``I used to have toxic seizures from the saturation of cocaine,''
he said. ``This happened to me at the wheel of a car on the San
Diego Freeway. I took out a hundred yards of crash fence. I could
have killed myself, or I could have killed other people.''
   He was oblivious to the ripe odor of the junkie life he shared
with Dance, and the pleadings of friends such as Nash, Jackson
Browne and Paul Kantner, of the Jefferson Airplane.
   ``I did let everybody down. I did get so completely out of it
that even the people who loved me the most had to back off and say
`I can't watch this.'''
   Crosby's Mill Valley, Calif., home became a fortress where
gunshots flared at phantom intruders. His talismans were cocaine,
and a pipe and torch used in freebasing. He also carried a
.45-caliber automatic pistol.
   Those terrible charms were with him on April 13, 1982, when
Dallas police found him sitting cross-legged on the dressing-room
floor of a nightclub, sucking cocaine vapors. Crosby was there to
perform, score some quick cash and add it to the millions of dollars
he estimates he smoked, snorted or gave away to predatory hangers-on
over the years. The bust was one of several in the '80s on drug,
weapon and other misdemeanor violations for Crosby.
   He was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, but the
conviction was overturned. Crosby was free on an appeal bond, but
kept violating its terms with more arrests and fleeing court-ordered
drug treatment programs six times.
   He spent two months in Dallas County Jail, was freed, then in
December 1985 he surrendered to authorities in West Palm Beach,
Fla., rather than follow through with a plan to flee the country
with Dance on a boat he owned.
   He was denied a release, and spent three months in the Dallas
County Jail and five months in the Huntsville, Texas prison.
   ``Huntsville has a terrible reputation. It's one of the worst
prison systems in the world,'' said Crosby, who was not separated
from prison population and worked in the institution's mattress
factory. ``I was hanging out with murderers and every kind of
criminal there is. I saw guys beaten to a pulp, I mean a bloody
wreck, right in front of me.
   ``But that's where I woke up. So I have this weird paradoxical
relationship with it. Yes, it was awful and at the same time it's
the place where my life took a turn, an enormous turn, for the
better.''
   Crosby was paroled in August 1986 and allowed to move back to
California, where he began tying loose ends together. Dance also had
shaken her addiction while Crosby was imprisoned.
   ``Jan went through the whole thing with me,'' Crosby said. ``A
lot of people tried to make her out as the fly in the ointment, but
the truth is I turned her on to freebase. They tried to carve her
out of my life every which way.''
   They were married in May 1987, and last June, the U.S. Supreme
Court upheld the reversal of Crosby's Texas arrest on the grounds of
illegal search and seizure.
   David Anderle was head of A&M Records artists and repertoire
section when he got a call a year ago from Crosby.
   ``I was excited,'' Anderle recalled. ``And I was a bit
apprehensive. I was nervous that it wouldn't be there anymore, and I
would have to be the one to tell him. But I think his voice is
sweeter now than I remember it. There is another added dimension of
his voice from growing older.''
   ``I was dying,'' Crosby said. ``And I just reached out by the
fingertips. So close. So close.''

<BYLINE>Strict Rules in Military's Biggest Prison</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By MATT TRUELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They call it ``The Castle,'' a
massive stone building with eight wings radiating from a central
six-story rotunda.
   The wings hold eight tiers of cells, stacked one upon the other,
and in each 8-by-10-foot cell an inmate is allowed a cot, a table
and a chair.
   The U.S. Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth is the biggest
military prison in the nation. It is a grim home for about 1,450
inmates, sent here from bases all over the world, wherever American
military men and women are stationed.
   Forty-two officers, including one lieutenant colonel, and 21
women are serving time here. Among them are drug dealers, armed
robbers, rapists, murderers and spies. More than 80 are serving life
terms. Three inmates are on death row.
   And there is strict military discipline.
   ``Our rules are so strict that if a guy turns left and he knows
he's not supposed to turn left, he's in trouble,'' said Lt. Col.
Gerald M. Gasko, prison chief of staff.
   ``You earn what you get here,'' added the prison commandant, Col.
Larry Berrong, a former Army airborne Ranger and Vietnam veteran.
``There aren't any free lunches.''
   Military officials say the goal of the prison is not just
confinement, but correction.
   ``Unfortunately, in the United States today we do a lot of
confining and not much correction,'' Gasko said. ``We attempt to
give them tools so when they leave here, they can be productive
citizens.''
   When inmates leave these walls, they return to civilian life, not
to the military.
   Next to discipline, training is the top priority at the Fort
Leavenworth prison, which has more than 20 vocational programs
including automotive repairs, printing, carpentry, upholstery, and
hotel and restaurant management.
   Inmates, whom officials would not allow to be interviewed, even
repair cars and furniture of military families living at Fort
Leavenworth.
   Officials claim the Disciplinary Barracks has the oldest shoe
repair business west of the Mississippi River, started in 1877 to
make boots for cavalrymen.
   Now it repairs everything from prescription orthopedic shoes to
cleated golf shoes, Gasko said.
   The prison also has one of the largest silk-screening businesses
in the nation, providing all the decals for U.S. Air Force planes.
   Congress authorized the prison's construction in 1874. An old
quartermaster depot that had supplied military posts in the Indian
Territory housed the first prisoners. The Castle was completed in
1915 by inmate labor.
   Inmate labor is still used for maintenance, but the prisoners
also work with their minds. Most have high school diplomas, and
those who don't go straight into the classroom when they arrive,
Gasko said.
   They can earn associate and bachelor's degrees through
correspondence, and a few are working on master's degrees, but Gasko
said they do that at their own expense.
   The prison takes enlisted men from all branches of the service
except the U.S. Navy. It takes all convicted officers, regardless of
the length of the sentence.
   Gasko said the shortest sentence for an officer he recalls is
seven days. ``I think they wanted him to see the inside of a
prison,'' he said.
   One inmate is going into his 17th year, he added.
   Some famous inmates have seen the inside of its walls, from Lt.
William Calley, who was convicted of murdering Vietnamese civilians
at My Lai, to Clayton Lonetree, the U.S. Marine who was convicted of
espionage while an embassy guard in Moscow.
   Three inmates are awaiting death sentence, although the Army has
not executed anyone since 1961 and no execution dates have been set.
They are:
   _ Ronald Gray, 22, of Liberty City, Fla., who was sentenced last
April in connection with the death of two women. He was stationed at
Fort Bragg, N.C.
   _ James Murphy, 24, of Clinton, N.C., who was convicted last year
of murdering his wife, his 6-year-old stepson, and his 2-year-old
son, while stationed in Nanau, Germany, with the Army.
   _ Ronnie Curtis, 22, a Marine from Wichita, Kan., who was
convicted in August 1987 of murdering his platoon commander and
platoon commander's wife at Camp Lejeune.
   Although most inmates are first-time offenders, the average
sentence is about 10 years. About two-thirds are serving time for
such crimes as assault, rape, murder or kidnapping; 17 percent are
imprisoned for narcotics violations, and 11 percent were sentenced
for theft. No inmate is serving time for just a military offense,
such as being absent without leave.
   Some prisoners work outside the walls and in nearby Leavenworth
on work-release programs. About 20 inmates work on the 2,600-acre
prison farm, which raises hogs and cattle and grows row crops and
vegetables.
   Outside The Castle walls, inmates who are ``installation
parolees'' stay in an unsecure barracks. They have proved
themeselves reliable while doing their time, and have earned a few
extra privleges.
   ``The only thing that keeps them out there is moral restraint,''
Gasko said. ``But the rules are extremely tough, and we don't
tolerate any violations.''

<HEAD>Francois Lesage: The Man Behind French Couture Glitter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Yves Saint Laurent took a bow to thunderous
applause after his 1988 winter couture collection, a lot of the
credit went to an unsung hero of couture, Francois Lesage.
   ``Fabulous, like wind through the vines,'' Saint Laurent told
Lesage, the 59-year-old master embroiderer whose workshop had
produced the sparkly grape bunches and leaves on satin jackets that
nearly brought down the house.
   Fashion-watchers still remember the ``chess-game'' jackets at
Chanel, and the Scherrer ``landscape'' scenes on clothes, as
produced by Lesage, who also turns out stunning designs for
Givenchy, Lacroix and Dior.
   Lesage has won the Medal of the City of Paris and other awards,
but he is rarely mentioned on a fashion program.
   ``Maybe we really are unsung heroes,'' he said in an interview.
   Lesage is guru and executive for 120 highly skilled employees,
depending on them to turn out couture's most striking embroidery for
many competing designers.
   ``You see how painstaking it is,'' Lesage said, strolling through
the rabbit warren of rooms that serve as his workshop near the
Opera. The young women bent over their embroidery frames looked
relaxed, although deep in their concentration.
   ``A fully beaded dress can take several women in the workshop up
to 1,800 hours, from sketch to last sequin,'' said Lesage.
   This gorgeous glitz doesn't come cheap.
   ``Maybe $100,000 for a totally beaded dress,'' said Lesage. ``But
some things you can't quibble over. It's like asking the price of a
custom-made car.''
   In 1924 his father and mother, Alfred and Louise Lesage, bought
the business from Paris' top embroiderer, Michonet. That was in the
heyday of the early days of couture, when the beaded flapper reigned.
   ``I grew up in these rooms,'' the son said. ``In fact I still
spend 10 hours a day here, and my wife and children complain.''
   Alfred Lesage's only major gaffe was when he experimented with
some new gelatin beads. He was awakened one night by an irate
customer whose dress had melted at the opera, leaving her in a sea
of bouillon.
   Work for Schiaparelli put Lesage in the limelight, as
Schiaparelli's clothes were more memorable for the fanciful
astrology, circus and other embroidery themes than for the actual
styles.
   World War II threw a damper on things, but in 1948, young
Francois sailed to New York to sell the Lesage embroidery. He ended
up working with Edith Head and other film designers, hiring Hispanic
women to do the embroidery.
   He met stars like Lana Turner and Marlene Dietrich, and found
Hollywood glamorous rather than vulgar, as others he knew had
perceived it.
   ``On the contrary, the Ziegfeld Follies, for instance, have
influenced some of our top French designers,'' he said.
   When his father died in 1950, Francois Lesage came home to take
over the leading executive role. He knows how each job is done, and
expects perfection.
   ``It begins with a sketch,'' he said, showing how a worker uses
an electric needle to pierce tiny holes along the sketching lines.
   ``Colored powder is pumped through the holes onto the fabric in a
stencil process. Then the endless threads of beads are chosen and
dyed if necessary to get the right color nuances.''
   Embroidering is done by hand, painstakingly attaching the threads
of beads or sequins to the fabric with a hooked needle.
   Most of the highly skilled workers are women, although the head
designer is a man.
   ``He lives here in the frantic weeks before the couture
showings,'' said Lesage. ``We have a dormitory.''
   Wandering through the storerooms, Lesage pointed out his treasure
trove of beads, sequins, rhinestones, cabochon stones and gold
braid, carefully packed in boxes.
   ``I have 60 tons of goods,'' he said. ``Enough to last 200
years.''
   Twice a year the workshop makes up samples as suggestions to
present to top couturiers, although they often call on the telephone
or send sketches of their own ideas.
   He has to be tactful in dealing with designers in a trade known
for jealousy and petty spats; he tries to accommodate all their
wishes.
   ``Saint Laurent once rang up from Morocco and wanted mice.''
Rodents he got, and they looked like pets rather than pests on Saint
Laurent's satin evening coats and jackets.
   Lesage feels his business is enjoying a boom, largely because of
the money designers can spend on luxurious details like embroidery
in a couture collection.
   ``The houses earn a great deal of money through their licenses _
putting their name on accessories. And they can increase their fame
by publicity they get from fabulous couture clothes, thus selling
more of the licensed goods,'' he said.
   ``While just a few women buy these expensive embroidered clothes,
the designers will still make them, just as part of the show to
promote their vast ready-to-wear and licensing lines.''
   Those who can't afford a dazzling embroidered couture gown can
buy a fanciful pin, belt or bag by Lesage at his shop next to the
Ritz in Paris or in a few American outlets.
   But these aren't baubles for bargain-hunters, either. Earrings
start at around $100; the most expensive embroidered handbag with
beaded fruit motifs costs $4,000.

<HEAD>Ford's Aerostar Van Should Be A Standout</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Minivans are becoming so plentiful, it's difficult to keep track
of all of them.
   But Ford's Aerostar wagon, while not having stellar sales growth,
should stand out in the pack. The 1989 Aerostar test vehicle with
Eddie Bauer trim package was a fine example of a minivan done right.
   It was plush, but not overly so. It was comfortable, yet rugged.
It was pleasant to drive, both around town for errands and out in
the country for hauling.
   While Chrysler's minivans have grabbed the lion's share of
publicity and sales since their introduction in the 1984 model year,
the Aerostar _ introduced in 1985 _ has quietly chugged along with
steady sales increases.
   Last year's Aerostar wagon sales rose 15 percent to 139,328 from
1986's 121,365. That was up from 24,851 in the startup year of 1985.
And sales this year are up again, rising 18.1 percent in the fiine
mont months of 1988, to 128,992 from 108,748 in the first nine
months of 1987.
   Sales aren't the only difference between the Chrysler and Ford
small vans. Chrysler's small vans, sold under td Dodge and Plymouth
nameplates, are built on a car chassis and are front-drive, while
the Aerostar is rear-drive and has a greater towing capacity for
such things as campers and horse trailers, said a Ford spokesman.
   The basic buyers are young families who use it for everything,
said Ford analyst Ray Windecker, adding that 95 percent of the
buyers are married and their households have a median 4.5 members.
   Median income is $42,500 a year. He noted the median age of
buyers is 37, with 95 percent married. Thirty-two percent of the
buyers and-or primary drivers are female.
   That closely tracks the Chrysler data, which show average age of
39 and median income of $45,000 for Plymouth Voyager minivans.
Occupations of buyers also are similar.
   Aerostar purchasers include professional and technical people (27
percent), proprietors and managers of businesses (14 percent) and
sales people (9 percent). The most often mentioned use for the vans
is for shopping and running family errands (93 percent), Windecker
said.
   Eighty-six percent also said they use it for pleasure driving,
and 83 percent said they use it for vacation trips. The test vehicle
ably demonstrated how versatile the Aerostar could be, though it
didn't come cheaply.
   While it started with a base price of around $11,000, the vehicle
came loaded. Options included a trip computer that monitored the
amount of fuel used and tasteful beige upholstery with colorful
stitched inserts on the seat backs, and the final price topped out
at more than $18,000.
   Chrysler's small vans also begin around $11,000 and can range up
to more than $17,000.
   The Ford Aerostar, powered by a 3-liter V-6 mated with optional
four-speed, automatic overdrive transmission, performed well, with
just a few instances in demanding driving where the vehicle jerked
as it sought to find the right gear.
   Fuel economy was admirable _ an average 21.5 miles per gallon in
city-highway driving. The Aerostar handled like a car, and
suspension was somewhat mushy, with a bit of body sway. But overall,
the vehicle felt stable.
   The van also was roomy. Legroom appeared to be sufficient in
every seat. And there were unique touches. The lock button on the
rear, lifting door was visible through the window, so I could
visually tell if the door was unlocked.
   There was a handle on the inside bottom of the door that made it
easier to pull the door down and close. I also appreciated the nice
details, such as the matching beige vinyl flaps at the rear bottom
of the bench seat covered the black metal frame of the seat.
   The other seats, called captain's chairs, had beige paint on the
frame that was color coded to go perfectly with the beige cloth
seats.
   Fit and finish inside and out was flawless. Passengers in the
rear also had their own controls for air conditioning and heat, with
the blowers neatly tucked overhead in the ceiling.
   There were plenty of bins and spots for extra storage of small
items and magazines. Even though the Aerostar is rear-drive, and
therefore taller, at 72.8 inches, than the Chrysler minivans that
average 65 inches in height, there was no problem getting in and out.
   I just turned and slid down the driver seat, for example. The
Aerostar front doors seemed well-designed for such moves. But the
front floor also slanted a bit toward the doors, meaning anything on
the floor would slide over to the doorway and lodge there during
driving.
   The only other problem on the vehicle was the fact the keyholes
on the doors outside were painted black to match the outside body
color. While that made for a sleek exterior, it also made it
difficult to find the keyholes at night.
   One more note: The Aerostar and the entire compact van market
continues to evolve. Ford plans a longer version of the Aerostar
later this year that will be sold along with the current
174.9-incher.
   The new Aerostar will be 190.3 inches in length.
   Chrysler in 1987 stretched its 175.9-inch minivans to offer
additional, 190.5-inch models.
   Also, the Aerostar will not be Ford's last effort in the compact
van segment. Earlier this year, the automakehe measure just
before Congress adjourned this year.
   The legislation was offered as a potential building block for
conservation programs in the next farm bill but its provisions are
expected to be modified based upon comments received in the coming
months.
   One farm group official says Fowler's legislation reflects the
growing integration of farming and environmental problems.
   ``If there is an issue of the moment for the next Congress in
agricultural conservation, I think it is the concern over water
quality in general, but particularly groundwater quality,'' says Jim
Riggle, director of field operations for the American Farmland Trust.
   Fowler's legislation would:
   _Establish a program offering incentives such as low-interest
loans and a reduction in crop insurance premiums for producers who
use ``low-input'' farming methods, generally practices that minimize
the use of agricultural chemicals and often are based on crop
rotations. Legumes frequently are employed as the rotation crop.
   One important feature of the legislation would protect farmers'
crop bases, which are used in determining subsidies, if they plant
legumes or other ``resource-conserving crops.'' A producer, for
example, could plant legumes on a portion of his acres normally
devoted to wheat or corn and still qualify for full subsidy benefits
as if the land had been planted for the program crop.
   _Create a ``transition demonstration'' program for farmers who
develop five-year plans for shifting larger portions of their
operations into low-input agriculture. Loans would be offered to
cover capital costs for any special equipment and bonus subsidy
payments would be available.
   The incentives, Fowler says, ``will ease the transition to
practices that deter erosion and bar harmful chemicals from our
water supply.''
   _Establish a ``Farmers Conservation Service'' branch in the
Extension Service to be devoted to low-input farming and assisting
producers interested in converting to those practices.
   _Establish a program for restoration of wetlands that have been
converted to cropland. Landowners would receive per-acre payments
and the program would help pay for the costs of seeding new cover
and any structures for restoring the wetlands. In addition, the
legislation would deny any farm program benefits to producers who
drain any natural wetlands.
   _Expand the size of the long-term Conservation Reserve Program
and encourage the planting of more hardwood trees.
   _Create a ``tree-buster'' penalty that would deny all farm
program benefits for producers who clear trees from lands for crop
production. The penalties are patterned after so-called sodbuster
provisions in the 1985 farm law to discourage cultivation of highly
erodible rangelands.
   _Require testing of water wells as a condition for participation
in federal farm programs. To help safeguard water quality, a
producer would have to implement a government-approved plan for
pesticide use if it is determined water wells or surface waters on
the farm are contaminated with agricultural chemicals. Similar
restrictions could be required of farmers in areas that are likely
sources of off-farm pesticide contamination. Federal farm program
benefits would be denied to producers who refuse to implement the
pesticide use plans.
   _Establish a program for the certification and labeling of
``organically grown'' farm products that are free of pesticides and
agricultural chemicals.
   Fowler says his proposal is not aimed at ``closing down the
chemical industry'' but is to help redirect American agriculture
``to protect ourselves, to save our environment and to help our
farmers.''
   Riggle, of the American Farmland Trust, says a number of farmer
groups in Midwestern states, including Illinois, are already working
on programs to encourage demonstration projects with low-input or
``sustainable'' agriculture.
   ``Here is a case where the concerns of the rank and file farmer,
I think, are a step or two ahead of the federal government at this
point in time,'' says Riggle.
   In addition, he contends that a broader conservation initiative
like Fowler's will be aided by a changing attitude of farmers about
potential environmental problems.
   ``The information that's coming in on some of the nitrates and
some of the pesticides in the well water supplies is honestly
frightening rank and file farmers in the Midwest,'' says Riggle.

   Prices soared to a record high on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today for the fourth session in a row, while the U.S.
dollar held its ground against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the market's
main price index, rose 166.71 points, or 0.57 percent, to close at a
record 28,996.12. The average reached a new high on Friday, and has
climbed in every session since then.
   Foreign exchange traders said the currency market was in a
wait-and-see mood in advance of today's release of U.S. monthly
trade figures for September in Washington.
   ``The dollar will surely take a direction if the trade (deficit)
figures are not around the predicted $10 billion,'' said an exchange
dealer at a major commercial bank, who spoke anonymously.
   The United States posted a trade deficit of $12.2 billion in
August.
   The dollar opened at 123.58 yen and was traded in a narrow range
of 123.45-123.65 yen before closing at 123.54 yen, up 0.29 yen from
Tuesday's close of 123.25 yen.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar drifted lower in Europe today after
U.S. trade figures for September showed a drop in the merchandise
trade deficit that was not big enough to reverse the currency's
steady decline.
   ``These figures are a little bit better than was expected,'' said
Richard Jeffrey, a senior economist for brokers Hoare Govett.
   ``However, I think the longer-term picture is still the same:
that demand is still too strong in the U.S. and that that is sucking
in exports to too great an extent.''
   Jeffrey told British Broadcasting Corp., ``Temporarily I think
these figures will lift some of the downward pressure from the
dollar and might stop interest rates going up in the very short
term.''
   In the longer term, however, he said the U.S. administration
would ``have to sanction higher interest rates to constrain consumer
demand.''
   Volume was thin because West German markets were closed for a
national holiday, traders said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.29 yen to a closing 123.54. After the trade
report, the dollar was quoted in London at 122.90 yen.
   Other dollar in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's prices,
included: 1.7400 West German marks, down from 1.7465; 1.4595 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4630; 5.9465 French francs, down from 5.9660;
1.9580 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9685; 1,292.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,300.50; and 1.2298 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2344.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8115, compared with
$1.8060 late Tuesday.
   Gold fell in calm trading in Europe. Bullion dealers said selling
from Eastern Europe and some orders from the United States brought
prices down from their Tuesday levels.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $422.15 a troy ounce
compared with $423.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of

<HEAD>Forstmann Little Abandons Idea of Bidding for Food-Tobacco Giant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acquisition specialist Forstmann Little & Co.
said today it has scrapped a plan to enter the bidding for RJR
Nabisco Inc., the food-tobacco giant targeted in the largest-ever
corporate takeover attempt.
   Forstmann Little said in a brief statement that an investment
group headed by the firm had decided ``consistent with its
investment criteria, it will not submit a proposal.''
   Its withdrawal from possible involvement in the battle for
Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco leaves two enormous contenders, a group
consisting of RJR Nabisco management, backed by the Wall Street
firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc., vs. the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   Both have offered more than $20 billion for RJR Nabisco, a maker
of products ranging from Oreo cookies to Winston cigarettes. Most of
that money would be borrowed and repaid via RJR Nabisco's earnings
and the sale of some of its assets, an increasingly controversial
transaction known as a leveraged buyout.
   Forstmann Little's withdrawal came three weeks after it held
talks with the RJR Nabisco management group and considered joining
their bid for the company. It then assembled a rival group
consisting of Procter & Gamble Co., Ralston Purina Co., Castle &
Cooke Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co.
   The RJR Nabisco management group stunned the financial world late
last month by disclosing its intention to acquire the company in a
leveraged buyout. The size, complexity and enormous debt load of
such a transaction have raised concerns about the use of borrowed
money to finance corporate takeovers.

   The stock market headed lower today after
Tuesday's mild rally faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.85 to 2,074.32
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 312 up, 567 down and
529 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.31 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that
the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $10.46 billion in September from
$12.27 billion the month before.
   The latest figure, while it suggested improvement in a basic
problem on many investors' minds, came in very close to advance
estimates in the financial community. Thus, analysts said, it didn't
really serve as new information.
   At the same time, brokers noted, stocks were still confronted
with competition from high interest rates, especially in short-term
interest-bearing investments that carry virtually no risk.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone & Telegraph
dropped [ to 28[; Exxon ] to 42{; International Business Machines |
to 116~, and Eastman Kodak [ to 44].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.33 to 151.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .06 at 289.53.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.09 to
2,077.17, snapping a four-session losing streak.
   Advancing and declining issues were nearly even in nationwide
trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 715 up, 709 down and 534
unchanged.
   Volume on the NYSE floor totaled 115.17 million shares, down from
142.90 million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Deficit Falls Nearly $2 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's merchandise trade deficit shrank
nearly $2 billion to $10.5 billion in September as exports hit a
record high, the government said today.
   The 15 percent improvement came from an August deficit revised
upward from $12.18 billion to $12.3 billion. Imports declined
slightly in September from the record high $39.8 billion posted the
previous month, the Commerce Department said.
   Analysts had anticipated the narrowing of the U.S. trade gap in
September following a large widening in August in what has been a
month-to-month seesaw pattern most of this year.
   Many analysts, however, had hoped for a greater narrowing of the
gap to prevent a new raid on the dollar, which fell last week on
currency markets over concerns about President-elect George Bush's
ability to bring down the trade and budget deficits.
   The dollar drifted lower on European and Canadian foreign
exchange markets in response to the trade report but trading was
thin because West German markets were closed for a national holiday.
Stock and bond prices on New York markets also edged lower in early
trading.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the new numbers
show that the trade gap is continuing to narrow but added that the
deficit is still too high.
   ``Continued strong progress will not be easy, but it can be
accomplished if we keep on the right course ... following
non-protectionist, growth-oriented trade policies,'' Yeutter said.
``The alternative would cost American jobs without bringing a
permanent reduction.''
   Including the September figures, the trade deficit the first nine
months of this year is running at an annual rate of $137.2 billion,
compared with a record $170.3 billion last year and $155.1 billion
in 1986.
   The 2.2 percent, or $700 million, September export increase to a
record $28.2 billion was led almost entirely by higher sales of
American autos, data processing and office equipment and chemicals,
the Commerce Department said.
   Sales of U.S. airplanes, telephone equipment and electrical
machinery abroad declined from August.
   Americans, meanwhile, bought $600 million less in manufactured
goods _ including fewer apparel products and shoes plus less iron
and steel _ and $400 million less oil from foreign producers in
September.
   Altogether, U.S. imports dropped by $1.1 billion to $38.7 billion
in September, the government said. But imports of foreign made autos
and auto parts climbed by 8 percent to an $8 billion monthly high
for the year.
   Oil imports fell from an average 7.9 million barrels per day in
August to 7.5 million barrels a day in September. The price also
dropped an average 45 cents per barrel to $14.60. The combination
reduced the nation's oil bill to foreign producers from $3.7 billion
in August to $3.3 billion the following month.
   As usual, the United States suffered its biggest deficit with
Japan. At $4.1 billion, however, the gap was $700 million less than
it had been in August and was at its lowest since January.
   The trade gap with Western European countries also fell by more
than $500 million to $880 million in September. And with the newly
industrialized Asian countries _ Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
South Korea _ it narrowed by nearly $250 million to slightly less
than $3.1 billion.
   But the U.S. deficit position with Canada nearly tripled to $1.1
billion.
   Before today's report was issued, Larry Chimerine, chairman of
the WEFA Group, a forecasting firm based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said a
deficit above $11 billion could create a new ``pounding of the
dollar.'' The dollar already has dropped in value by about 8 percent
against the Japanese yen and 6 percent against the West German mark
since early October.
   The federal budget deficit for fiscal 1988, which ended Sept. 30,
was $155.1 billion, 3.6 percent larger than it was last year.
Concerns about the red ink, and about President-elect George Bush's
resolve to stem it given his no-tax-increase pledge, were widely
blamed for last week's stock market and dollar declines.
   Bush and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady have both tried this
week to calm fears that the incoming administration would scrap a
two-year effort by the United States and its major allies to keep
the value of the dollar stable.

<HEAD>Report: Grand Met Threatened to Lower Pillsbury Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC has threatened to lower
its $5.23 billion takeover bid if Pillsbury Co.'s planned spinoff of
its Burger King Corp. unit occurs, according to a published report
Wednesday.
   Attorneys for the British conglomerate told a Delaware court that
Grand Met would be ``required to make fundamental changes to its
($60-a-share) offer'' should the spinoff occur first, the Wall
Street Journal reported.
   Among the changes would be a lower price to reflect a potential
tax liability of several hundred million dollars, the Journal
reported.
   In addition, since Burger King would become a Florida
corporation, Grand Met would have to mount additional legal attacks
on Florida's anti-takeover laws should it still want to acquire the
fast-food chain, the Journal quoted Grand Met attorneys as saying.
   Pillsbury's stock closed at $58 Tuesday, down 62.5 cents, in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   ``The spinoff will make it substantially less likely that Grand
Met will ever successfully acquire the entire Pillsbury company,''
Grand Met's attorneys said in a letter to the Delaware Chancery
Court.
   The court is reconsidering the validity of Pillsbury's ``poison
pill'' defense, an attempt by the Minneapolis-based food and
restaurant company to thwart a takeover. The pill is designed to
discourage Grand Met from buying tendered shares, since to do so
would increase the price.
   Pillsbury spokesmen did not immediately return a phone call
Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, Grand Met extended to Nov. 18 its $60-per-share offer
for Pillsbury, saying that 79.1 percent of Pillsbury stock now has
been tendered to the British firm. It was the third extension of the
offer, which was launched Oct. 4.
   Grand Met said nearly 67.6 million shares of Pillsbury common
stock had been tendered and not withdrawn by the Monday night
deadline. When it extended its second deadline of Nov. 8, Grand Met
reported that about 74.3 percent of Pillsbury's outstanding shares
had been tendered.
   Pillsbury, which has rejected the bid as ``inadequate,'' had no
comment Tuesday on the extension of the offer.
   Pillsbury Chairman Philip Smith has told Pillsbury shareholders
they would be better off holding on to their stock because Pillsbury
has proposed spinning off Burger King into a separate public company
in a restructuring that would include a special dividend. Pillsbury
shareholders would receive the dividend and Burger King stock under
the plan. Additional moves also are being considered to enhance
shareholder value, Smith has said.
   Grand Met's attorneys, in the letter to the Delaware court,
characterized the Burger King spinoff proposal as a ``poison tax''
designed to kill any deal. While the spinoff, which is scheduled to
occur Dec. 2, is structured to be tax-free for current Pillsbury
holders, it would create a huge tax liability for any third party
who bought Pillsbury after Dec. 2.
   Attorneys for Pillsbury shareholders urged the court to set a
hearing on motions to extend that date, the Journal reported. The
holders say they needed more time, partly because they don't have
detailed information yet on the spinoff's tax consequences.
   Grand Met's letter describes the spinoff plan as ``another time
bomb, planted by Pillsbury's management, to deter the acquisition of
the company by Grand Met or any other party.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $10.5 billion in
September, the government said today in a report that led to
declines in the value of stocks, bonds and the dollar.
   The deficit figure, although smaller, was toward the high end of
market expectations and raised the possibility that the dollar would
need to fall further to make American goods cheaper in world markets.
   ``The numbers showed improvement; there's no question about it.
But the absolute number's still pretty high,'' said John McCarthy,
chief dealer of Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York.
   Exports set a record, while imports dropped slightly from their
record levels of August, the Commerce Department said.
   Currency traders said they believed the Federal Reserve had
bought dollars with Japanese yen to support the U.S. currency, but
it had little effect and the dollar soon resumed its decline.
   The dollar fell about half a percent against the Japanese yen and
1 percent against the West German mark by late morning in New York,
dipping to 122.6 Japanese yen and 1.728 West German marks from 123.2
yen and 1.743 marks late Tuesday. The dollar is now slightly above
its lowest point against the yen since modern exchange rates were
established in the late 1940s.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 19.03 points
to 2,058.14 as of 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Declining stocks
outnumbered advancing ones by a 7-to-2 margin on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   In the credit market, the price of the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction,
rose to 9.06 percent from 9.01 percent late Tuesday. As recently as
Nov. 1, the long bond yielded just 8.76 percent.
   The 2.2 percent, or $700 million, September export increase to a
record $28.2 billion was led almost entirely by higher sales of
American autos, data processing and office equipment and chemicals,
the department said.
   For the first nine months of the year, the trade deficit is
running at an annual rate of $137.2 billion, compared with a record
$170.3 billion last year and $155.1 billion in 1986.
   In another report today, the Commerce Department said business
inventories jumped 0.7 percent in September, the 21st consecutive
monthly increase, while sales remained virtually unchanged.
   The combination of rising inventories and flat sales is a sign of
economic weakness. However, business sales have been generally
strong this year and economists said the gain in inventories during
most months was in line with sales.
   On Wall Street Tuesday, stocks rose marginally in the lightest
trading in seven weeks. Investors had been reluctant to participate
ahead of the trade report.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.09 points to
2,077.17.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange fell to 115.17 million
shares, down from 142.90 million in the previous session and the
lowest since a 113.72 million-share day Sept. 28.
   Worries about accelerating inflation sparked by the retail sales
report released Tuesday initially drove bond prices sharply lower,
although they later recovered on the strength of falling prices for
crude oil and other key commodities.
   Anticipation of the September trade figures also kept foreign
exchange trading edgy. The dollar fell to 123.23 Japanese yen in
late New York trading from 123.75 yen Monday.
   In other economic developments Tuesday:
   _The Federal Reserve Board reported that U.S. industrial
production rose 0.4 percent in October, the biggest increase in
three months, despite a decline in activity in the nation's oil
fields.
   _U.S. automakers reported that their car and light truck sales
rose 14.9 percent in early November compared with results a year
earlier that were depressed by the absence of buyer incentives.
   _A majority of the nation's small-business owners believe the
federal budget deficit is the No. 1 issue facing President-elect
George Bush, and they favor spending cuts to reduce the shortfall,
according to a poll by the accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Co.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales rose to a seasonally
adjusted $135.6 billion in October, boosted by gains at department
stores and auto dealerships. It also revised its figures for the two
previous months, showing a brisker sales pace than previously
thought.
   ``These numbers give a much different picture than just a month
ago. Some people were betting the expansion would die of old age.
These numbers refute that strongly,'' said David Jones, an economist
with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government securities dealer in New
York.
   But, he said the unexpected strength has rekindled concern about
inflation, which had waned as growth cooled in August and September.
   In the latest report, the government said retail sales fell 0.3
percent in September, up from an earlier estimate of a 0.4 percent
decline, and rose 0.3 percent in August, rather than falling 0.1
percent as previously thought.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colby Chandler, chairman and chief
executive officer of Eastman Kodak Co., has spent 38 years learning
the lessons of business, the theories of economics and the
inside-out story of the world's largest photography company.
   Now, after five years at the helm of Kodak, Chandler is ready to
take his message on the future of manufacturing to the masses.
   So, move over Lee Iacocca because here comes Colby ``America
won't make it without manufacturing'' Chandler.
   At 63, the low-key engineer, who grew up and still lives on a
farm, is learning how to become a stand-up spokesman for corporate
America. If it sounds political, it is.
   ``Watching the swing toward a service-intensive society and
listening to some parties say that's good is scary,'' said Chandler
in an interview at Kodak's headquarters in Rochester.
   ``I have no intention of talking to the walls on this subject,''
Chandler said.
   Kodak's chief has been out preaching the manufacturing gospel to
business groups, college students, politicians and anybody else who
will listen. The company also commissioned a study by three leading
economists on the importance of manufacturing and started its
first-ever public affairs advertising campaign on the issue.
   Chandler also is using his last few weeks as chairman of
President Reagan's Export Council, the chief advisory group to the
Department of Commerce, to drum up support.
   ``The importance of manufacturing to the economy has been
something that's been so obvious to me, and I'm sure to others like
me, that it might not have ever occurred to us that it wasn't
obvious to everyone else,'' he said.
   Although leaders of service industries might disagree, Chandler
claims that one job making a car, or a copier, or a computer, is 10
times more valuable to the economy than a job selling insurance, or
waiting on customers in a bank, or making airline reservations.
   The percentage of workers employed in manufacturing in America _
20 percent of the work force _ is lower than at any time this
century, according to the Kodak-commissioned study ``The Case For
Manufacturing in America's Future.''
   What that means, Chandler said, is that the large ``multiplier
effect'' manufacturing has in stimulating the economy through higher
wages, buying supplies and raw materials, and creating new and
improved products is drying up.
   ``It's a very critical ... edge that we walk,'' Chandler said.
``We're not the country with leading productivity gains. That's a
sign. When we reach the real crisis, we will have gone so far that
bringing it back is going to take decades and decades.''
   The best way to help manufacturing in the immediate future would
be to eliminate the federal deficit, Chandler said. But for the
long-term, he suggested:
   _Urging the government to make education and other
people-oriented benefits a priority.
   _Using spending and tax policies to encourage investment in new
technology and research.
   _Implementing an incremental investment tax credit that would
provide incentives for companies to expand a plant or buy new
equipment.
   _Altering the nation's tax structure to put a higher emphasis on
taxing consumption rather than the current system of taxing
investment and saving.
   Chandler has always had a reputation on Wall Street as ``Mr. Long
Term,'' even before he took over as chairman of Kodak.
   He came to the company in 1950 after graduating from the
University of Maine with a physics degree. His worked as a quality
control engineer and then held various management positions.
   He received a master's degree in management from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in 1964 and directed the development of
Kodak's Ektaprint copiers and duplicators in 1973. He was named
president of the company in 1977 and chairman in 1983.
   As chairman, Chandler has sent the yellow Kodak banner charging
into Japan and given assembly-line workers almost complete control
over film and other products they make.
   And he's added aspirins, batteries and household cleaners to the
list of products Kodak sells through new ventures and the
acquisition of Sterling Drug Co.
   ``He never seemed as concerned with the nuts and bolts stuff of
today or tomorrow. What interested him was Kodak three, five, 10, 20
years from now,'' said Brian Fernandez, a stock analyst with Brean
Murray, Foster Securities.
   When Chandler started Kodak's restructuring effort several years
ago to cut out layers of management and give each employee more
responsibility, Chandler said he restructured his job to include a
more active role in outside affairs that affect the company.
   Unfortunately, it appears that no one seems to care about the
eroding manufacturing base of the country, especially the
politicians, Chandler said.
   He's learning how to handle himself in the political world where
``almost everything that is said has very little substance'' and in
the media, where words have to be carefully chosen.
   It's basic public relations, Chandler admits, but it's something
he's only starting to understand.
   If government officials were doing their jobs correctly, he said
he wouldn't have to worry about developing an expertise in
communications.
   ``They're patching up problems and they're responding to special
interests and there's very little sitting back in a statesmanlike
way saying where do we want to lead this country,'' Chandler said.
   ``You perhaps could make an observation that they can't. My
feeling is they must.''

   Elderly and disabled people who have been
denied Social Security benefits would face tougher requirements for
appealing the decisions under new rules proposed by the government.
   The Social Security Administration calls the proposal preliminary
and says final action is unlikely before next spring.
   Such a rule would meet strong opposition from Congress, said Rep.
Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the House Aging Committee.
The private National Committee to Preserve Social Security and
Medicare said the proposal would be ``stacking the deck'' against
recipients.
   The American Association of Retired Persons said the rule change,
if adopted, appears to violate the spirit of the Social Security
program.
   The proposal by the agency's Office of Hearings and Appeals has
not yet been reviewed by Social Security Commissioner Dorcas Hardy,
said agency spokesman Phil Gambino.
   Under the proposed rule change, people who are challenging the
denial of benefits would be required to submit all of their evidence
in advance of a hearing before an administrative law judge, he said
Tuesday.
   Currently, new evidence may be submitted during the hearing, but
Gambino said the proposal would allow that only if new information
had come to light too late to be produced ahead of time.
   Also, Gambino said a pre-hearing meeting would be required in an
effort to outline the areas of disagreement.
   Gambino said the proposal was ``just a brainstorming idea'' and
is expected to go through several governmental levels before a final
decision is made.
   The current appeals process can last four to six months, Gambino
said. About half of all cases are reversed on appeal.
   Ken Hoagland, spokesman for the National Committee to Preserve
Social Security and Medicare, said Social Security was ``trying to
stack the deck against disability appeal claimants.''
   ``They are tyring to change the rules. If you can't win under the
rules of evidence that exist now, change the rules. It's stacking
the deck, that's what it is.''
   Martin Corry, AARP's Social Security staff specialist, said he
had not yet seen the draft of the notice of proposed rule-making.
   But, he said, AARP hopes that such a change would get the close
attention of Secretary of Health and Human Services Otis Bowen
because ``as a physician he would bring to that consideration
perhaps a better understanding of the potential harm that could be
done to disabled persons.''
   ``Older and disabled persons have earned their Social Security
and Medicare benefits and once again the administration is trying to
deny vulnerable citizens what they are entitled to,'' said Royball.
He said he finds it interesting that the proposed change is becoming
known the week after the election.

<HEAD>Houston's Heritage Plaza Sold For $110 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heritage Plaza, the downtown area's newest and
emptiest skyscraper, was sold for $110 million to a Houston-based
partnership whose major investor is the Michigan Employees
Retirement System.
   The 53-story tower was sold Tuesday by 261 Associates Ltd. to the
Coventry Fund III. Coventry Investment Group, a Houston investment
adviser, will manage the building as general partner.
   The Michigan pension fund and Laudio III, a Spanish investment
company using pension money from a Spanish pipe and steel company,
are limited partners.
   Heritage Plaza was completed in 1986 but has yet to attract a
large tenant. Only 8 percent of the 1.2-million-square-foot plaza is
occupied, Coventry officials said.
   The 1 million square feet of space available to lease is the
largest contiguous block of new, high-quality office space downtown.
The new owners said a $5 million renovation is planned for the
property, along with an aggressive leasing program.
   Texaco Inc. and several other companies have been shopping for
large blocks of office space downtown, said R.F. Howard, president
of DMH Properties, a newly formed unit of Coventry.
   Coventry, however, had declined to enter into any lease
negotiations until the purchase was closed, Howard said.

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today that continuing high federal budget deficits represent a
``dangerous corrosion'' of the U.S. economy and must be reduced.
   Greenspan joined a number of other top economic experts
testifying as the National Economic Commission launched its
post-election effort to come up with solutions to the seven-year
budgetary deadlock.
   While the budget deficit was often ignored during the
presidential debates, Greenspan and many other witnesses told the
advisory panel that it was the major problem facing President-elect
George Bush and the new Congress.
   Bush has been forced in recent days to calm jittery financial
markets by stating that he plans to make deficit-reduction a top
priority and will meet with congressional leaders to come up with an
acceptable package.
   Many of the witnesses before the commission said this is exactly
what Bush needs to do, and several said that unless a credible
deficit agreement is reached quickly, the country faces continued
turmoil in financial markets.
   Greenspan, given his sensitive position as head of the U.S.
central bank, was not as ed $749.4 billion. Sales
fell a scant $35 million to $495.4 billion.
   The combination of rising inventories and flat sales is a sign of
economic weakness. If the trend continued, it could lead to fewer
orders from retailers, so they could sell off their backlog of
goods, and consequently to production cutbacks and layoffs at
manufacturing plants.

<BYLINE>Factory Use</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of capacity at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose
0.2 percentage points in October to 84.0 percent, the highest since
February 1980, the Federal Reserve Board said. The gain followed no
change in September, a 0.1 percentage point gain in August and a
sharp 0.7 percentage point rise in July.
   The overall rate is approaching the 85 percent threshold that
economists believe clearly signals a pickup in inflation.
   Capacity use has grown or held steady for eight consecutive
months, raising concern that factories will have trouble producing
enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price
increases.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a continuation of the price
slide that began late last week.
   Crop futures prices have closed lower in three of the last four
sessions and today's lower opening was ``just follow-through from
the liquidation taking place,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The Agriculture Department's announcement late Tuesday of the
sale of 1.2 million metric tons of corn to the Soviet Union had been
expected and had little effect on prices this morning, analysts said.
   And while the decline in U.S. grain prices appeared to be
generating some new buying interest in Europe, it will take a much
larger boost in demand to propel prices higher, Mao said.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 2\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.13{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to { cent lower with December at $2.65{ a bushel; oats
were { cent lower across the board with December at $2.09{ a bushel;
and soybeans were 1{ cents lower to { cent higher with November at
$7.42 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .23 cent lower with December at
73.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent lower
with November at 81.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .20
cent lower with December at 40.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .52 cent to .92 cent lower with February at 44.25 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled sharply higher on Tuesday. Pork futures
also advanced.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. on Wednesday said its profit nearly
tripled in the latest quarter as sales climbed 46.3 percent.
   The Japanese consumer electronics company said its results were
helped by cost-cutting and rises in domestic and overseas sales in
all product groups, including its record operations, which were
augmented by the acquisition of CBS Records Inc.
   In the second quarter of its fiscal year, Sony said net earnings
rose to 13.1 billion yen, or $97 million at current exchange rates,
from 4.762 billion yen a year earlier. Revenue rose to 529 billion
yen, or $4.39 billion, from a revised 361.358 billion yen a year
earlier.
   In the first half of its fiscal year, the company said it had net
earnings of 29.2 billion yen, or $216 million, more than triple the
profit of 8 billion yen a year earlier. Revenue rose 41.9 percent to
992 billion yen, or $7.35 billion, from 699 billion yen a year
earlier.
   By market, sales inside Japan rose 42.2 percent, sales to the
United States rose 39.4 percent, sales to Europe rose 54.1 percent
and sales to other regions rose 58.8 percent. Sony does about a
third of its business in Japan and just under a third in the United
States.
   Dollar equivalents are calculated on the basis of 135 yen to the
dollar, the rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period.

   A judge said neither a drug company nor
a grocery chain could be blamed for the death of a woman killed by
cyanide-tainted Tylenol capsules, and he dismissed a $93 million
suit filed by her estate.
   Diane Elsroth, 23, died in 1986 after taking Tylenol from a box
that had not been opened. The death was ruled a homicide but the
murder was never solved.
   U.S. District Judge Gerard L. Goettel on Tuesday said that
authorities had not determined exactly how the capsules had been
tampered with but that there was no dispute it occurred ``after the
product left the manufacturer's control.''
   ``An injustice has been done,'' Goettel said of Ms. Elsroth's
death. ``But we think a second would be perpetrated were we to
permit recovery against these defendants for a wrong they did not
truly commit.''
   Ms. Elsroth died two days after taking two Extra-Strength Tylenol
capsules in Yonkers.
   The lawsuit, alleging negligence and product liability, named as
defendants McNeil Consumer Products Co., which manufactures Tylenol;
its parent, McNeilab Inc., and the A&P supermarket chain, from which
the Tylenol was bought.
   Spokesmen for the two companies said they were pleased by the
decision.
   Russell Clune, an attorney for the Elsroth family, said he had no
comment.

   Look under Christmas trees across the country
this year, and you'll find packages with the name Nintendo waiting
for millions of children.
   The toy industry has its first mega-hit in two years in the
Japanese-made video game. But there are a lot of smaller, home-grown
hits as well, with familiar names like Barbie, G.I. Joe and Real
Ghostbusters leading the pack.
   Nintendo has surged to the forefront of the toy industry,
although it hasn't created the hysteria that Cabbage Patch Kids did
in the mid-1980s, when some stores had several near-riots as parents
fought over the dolls that were in short supply.
   But even without shoving matches among prospective buyers, the
video game is expected to rack up a phenomenal $1.7 billion in U.S.
sales for 1988, more than double the $800 million it had last year.
By comparison, Coleco Industries Inc.'s Cabbage Patch Kids did $600
million in 1985, their peak year.
   The toy industry as a whole is expecting sales to run about even
or slightly ahead of last year's $12.5 billion, according to the Toy
Manufacturers of America, a trade group. The lion's share of that
business is done at Christmas.
   This holiday season, several Nintendo games are among the
``must-have'' toys: Super Mario Brothers II, Zelda II and Double
Dragon.
   But industry watchers caution consumers to shop early, because
supplies of the chips needed to make the game cartridges have been
tight. Rick Anguilla, editor of the trade newspaper Toy & Hobby
World, predicted, ``You can count on plenty of shortages for
Nintendo softwear.''
   Nintendo represents the first major hit in the toy industry since
Worlds of Wonder Inc.'s Lazer Tag in 1986. The video game also was
the standout last year, when the rest of the industry was in a slump.
   Nintendo's success has given the Japanese company a massive 85
percent share of the video game market, up from 70 percent at end of
1987, Anguilla estimated.
   The company's sales have come at the expense of U.S.-marketed
video games, such as Mattel Inc.'s Sega and Atari Corp.'s video
system. As a result, Hasbro Inc. recently announced it was
discontinuing its Nemo video game.
   Other toy companies, such as LJN, decided against competing with
Nintendo, and instead are producing Nintendo softwear under
licensing agreements, said Anguilla, who commented, ``If you can't
beat 'em, join 'em.''
   The Japanese import was one of the few high-tech items to succeed
in 1987. Consumers spent millions of dollars on Nintendo, but they
shunned other high-priced electronic toys in favor of dolls, board
games and preschool items like play food.
   Seeing this trend, manufacturers put greater emphasis in 1988 on
these toys, which cost less to produce and are more profitable.
   The U.S. companies also gave up their dependence on action
figures _ superheroes, aliens and robots _ tied to television shows.
The toy makers helped produce the shows, but when the segment
declined, they got out of the entertainment business, which had been
another expensive proposition.
   ``A lot of manufacturers out there are getting back to what they
do best, making toys,'' Anguilla said.
   Among the casualties in the action figure segment was Hasbro's
Inhumanoids.
   While the strategy of marketing figures with a TV show is fading,
television tie-ins are not completely dead. Universal-Matchbox's
talking Pee-Wee Herman doll and Kenner-Parker Toys' Real
Ghostbusters are among the TV figures that remain big sellers,
according to Angela Bourdon, a spokeswoman for Toys R Us Inc., the
nation's largest toy store chain.
   Other action figures that are popular are Kenner-Parker's
Starting Lineup, which is based on real-life athletes, and
Playmate's Mutant Ninja Turtles.
   G.I. Joe, Hasbro's military action figure and a perennial
favorite, also continues to thrive.
   Other big sellers among boys' toys are radio-controlled cars; Hot
Wheels by Mattel; and Micro Machines, small cars and trucks produced
by Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.
   Micro Machines have helped Galoob recover from its 1987 slump,
when the company _ like many other toy manufacturers _ over-invested
in expensive high-tech failures.
   For girls, Mattel's Barbie is expected to have her best year ever
as she approaches the grand old age of 30.
   Some newer entries in the doll market are also expected to have a
good season. Those cited by Anguilla and Ms. Bourdon included Lewis
Galoob's Bouncin' Babies, 7-inch-tall, battery-operated dolls;
Hasbro's Dolly Surprise, which has hair that grows; and Mattel's
Little Miss Makeup.
   ``Dolls are going to be a monster category,'' Anguilla predicted.
   Play food _ those miniature cans of soup and vegetables _ was a
surprise hit last year and continues strong in 1988.
   Fisher-Price's Fun With Food, which led the preschool segment in
1987, is doing well again this year. The company has extended the
line to include its Magic Scan Checkout, a pretend supermarket
checkout counter that Ms. Bourdon labeled a big seller at Toys R Us.
   Among board games, Pictionary by Games Gang Ltd. and its
counterpart from Hasbro's Milton Bradley line, called Win, Lose or
Draw, are expected to remain big sellers.
   Securities analysts say the toy industry's strategy shift, plus
extensive cost-cutting among the big U.S. firms, is returning the
business to profitability. Last year, all the major companies except
Hasbro ended up in the red.
   ``In 1988 you've seen these companies stabilize and build a
foundation for future growth,'' said Paul Valentine, an analyst with
Standard & Poor's Corp. ``You're going to see a real resurgence by
the American companies.''

   It's a retailer's dream _ a store opened in
time for the Christmas season, that customers flock to and that is
more successful than anyone's wildest expectations.
   A Disney fantasy for storeowners? Better than that _ it's a
Disney reality.
   The Walt Disney Co., which last year debuted three stores to
market clothing, mugs and other merchandise bearing the likeness of
Mickey Mouse and his friends, opened 10 more this year, aiming for
the big Christmas season.
   If the early returns are any indication, they will be enormously
profitable.
   Donna Moore, a vice president at the Disney stores, said the
three stores that opened in 1987 have had double-digit percentage
gains in sales over last year's results. By comparison, many of the
nation's biggest retailers have been struggling to eke out increases
of 3 percent.
   Disney anticipated the stores would be successful, but not that
successful. ``It's almost like we're pinching ourselves,'' Ms. Moore
said.
   ``We have a couple of winners that are far exceeding our
expectations,'' she added, citing the recently opened outlets at
Paramus Park Mall here and at Tysons Corner, Va., outside of
Washington.
   The other Disney stores are clustere to be the top sellers
this Christmas. The list, compiled by the trade newspaper Toy &
Hobby World, is based on October toy sales.
   _Nintendo Entertainment System by Nintendo. The company is still
selling its console units to first-time buyers, but it will do big
business this season with Nintendo games, including Super Mario
Brothers II, Zelda II and Double Dragon.
   _Barbie, by Mattel Inc. The reigning queen of fashion dolls,
about to turn 30, is expected to have her biggest year ever. The
company is marketing a special holiday edition this year.
   _Micro Machines by Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. These tiny cars and
trucks are sold several to a package.
   _Pictionary by Games Gang Ltd. This board game is based on
charades, with players drawing their clues instead of acting them
out.
   _Real Ghostbusters by Kenner-Parker Toys, a division of Tonka
Corp. These action figures are based on the popular Saturday morning
cartoon show.
   _G.I. Joe by Hasbro Inc. Military action figures and vehicles
that have been best-sellers for years.
   _Win, Lose or Draw, by Hasbro's Milton Bradley line. Another
board game based on charades.
   _Hot Wheels by Mattel. Small cars and trucks sold individually.
   _Starting Lineup by Kenner-Parker. Baseball and football action
figures based on real-life sports stars.
   _Dolly Surprise by Hasbro. This doll features hair that grows
when its arm is raised.

<TEXT>
   Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services, an Australian
leasing group, has ordered 22 Boeing jetliners worth approximately
$1.12 billion, Boeing Commercial Airplanes confirmed Wednesday.
   So far this year, an industry-record 595 Boeing commercial jets
have been ordered, valued at $28 billion.
   The latest order is for six 767-300 extended range widebody jets
and 16 mid-sized 757s, plus options on an additional seven 767
aircraft, said Boeing spokesman Tom Cole.
   Cole said the airplane manufacturer was not releasing an exact
price for the order, at Ansett's request. However, a 757 is worth
approximately $44 million and a 767-300 sells for around $70 million.
   The 757s will be powered by Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines, in a
deal worth approximately $318 million to the British engine firm.
Engines for the 767-300s will be announced later, Boeing said.
   Ansett Worldwide is the leasing arm of TNT Ltd. and The News
Corp. Ltd., which also owns Ansett Airlines and East West Airlines
in Australia.
   Deliveries of the 767s will start in October 1990 and continue
through 1993. Ansett has reserved the right to substitute smaller
767-200 or shorter-range 767-300 aircraft if it choses.
   Ansett also will start receiving its new 757s in October 1990,
and will continue to do so through 1995. Some of the 757s may be
delivered in a freighter configuration, the carrier said.
   The twin-engined 757 holds about 186 passengers and can fly up to
about 4,000 miles. The 767-300ER, also a two-engine plane, can carry
261 people 6,200 miles.
   The order brings to 353 the number of 767s ordered to date and
the number of 757s ordered to 387.

   GTE Corp. said Wednesday it has selected
this suburb of Dallas for the consolidated general office
headquarters of its biggest division, telephone operations.
   Kent Foster, group vice president of GTE telephone operations,
said the communications company would transfer 3,000 employees from
all over the country to temporary office space here beginning in
January 1989. The move also was expected to create 1,000 new GTE
jobs here, company officials said.
   GTE will build a one million square-foot ``campus-like facility''
on a 112-acre site in the Las Colinas business development area. The
facility will house more than 4,000 employees and will be ready for
occupancy in mid-1991.
   Other sites under consideration were Tampa, Fla., Thousand Oaks,
Calif. and Westfield, Ind.
   The selection by the Stamford, Conn.-based communications giant
was the latest of several corporate moves to the Dallas-Fort Worth
area.
   AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, moved to nearby Fort
Worth about five years ago and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. is in the
process of moving its headquarters to the Dallas suburb of Plano.
Both formerly were based in New York City.
   Six days ago, the federal government picked a site just south of
Dallas to build the ``super collider'' project. The $4.4 billion
high-energy physics project also is expected to generate thousands
of jobs.
   GTE began restructuring its telephone operations in March.
Telephone operations account for $12 billion of GTE's $15 billion in
annual revenue.
   So far, the business has been restructured into three groups _
the mobile communications unit, which will be located in Houston
with 1,000 employees; the information services unit, which will be
moved to Tampa, Fla, with its more than 5,800 employees, and the
local telephone service unit.
   The telephone operating group, which is composed of the three
units, has a total of 91,600 domestic employees.
   The company has 1,100 employees at its corporate headquarters in
Stamford, 300 of whom are in the telephone operating group. The
company is keeping its corporate headquarters in Stamford.
   James L. Broadhead, who was president of GTE Telephone Operations
until recently, said in a recent interview that 3,000 to 4,000
people of an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 employed by the local
service unit around the country will work in the telephone
headquarters operation.

   Grain futures closed mostly lower while soybean
futures finished slightly higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Analysts said the quiet session appeared to mark the end of the
recent selling wave.
   ``It looks like a lot of the liquidation has run its course; it
looks like the market is finally finding some support at these lower
levels,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in New York.
   Grain and soybean prices had declined in three of the previous
four trading sessions as the market reflected dismay at the
relatively slow pace of grain sales for export.
   The Soviet Union's purchase this week of at least 1.5 million
metric tons of U.S. corn helped steady the corn market, analysts
said, and the general drop in prices appeared to be generating some
new buying interest in Europe.
   At the close, wheat was 3\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.10{ a bushel; corn was 2
cents lower to \ cent higher with December at $2.64} a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 4{ cents lower with December at $2.05{ a bushel;
and soybeans were \ cent to 2{ cents higher with November at $7.46 a

<TEXT>
   The dollar's rapid slide toward 40-year lows
illustrates the truth of a favorite maxim of traders: ``The trend is
your friend.''
   The sharp drop of the dollar on Wednesday was attributed to the
government's trade deficit report, but a bigger factor was probably
the general bearish mood in the markets.
   As long as the trend in the dollar appeared to be downward, few
traders were willing to buy dollars even if they happened to believe
the trade report was fundamentally good for the U.S. currency.
   If the market's mood had been more positive, it is possible the
dollar might have rallied in response to the same Commerce
Department report of a $10.5 billion merchandise trade deficit for
the month of September.
   ``Traders don't care what's going to happen next week. They care
about today or tomorrow,'' said Shafiqul Islam, a senior fellow for
finance at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.
   This is not to say that currency exchange rates have nothing to
do with fundamental factors, such as trade patterns, inflation and
economic growth. But since economists and government leaders cannot
agree on what the rates really should be, there is plenty of room
for speculation.
   The dollar on Wednesday neared its lowest point against the
Japanese yen since the establishment of modern exchange rates in the
late 1940s. It fell to 122.4 yen and 1.723 West German marks, a
decline of more than 8 percent against the yen and 7 percent against
the mark since early October.
   Ironically, in early October the dollar was rising so powerfully
that central banks were striving to slow its ascent by selling
dollars in the open market. In a complete reversal, the Federal
Reserve on Wednesday was buying dollars to support the currency.
   It doesn't matter to traders whether the dollar rises or falls,
as long as it does not move sideways. Often traders, sitting at
their computer screens, will sell dollars into a dull market just to
see if they can start a chain reaction.
   ``Exchange markets are horrified by the idea of the stability of
exchange rates,'' said Islam.
   Big banks in Japan, Europe and the United States dominate the
world foreign-exchange markets, trading currencies both for clients
and for their own accounts. When currency rates are stable, their
business dries up.
   Foreign-exchange trading is ``becoming an increasing line item in
banks' profits,'' said Brent Erensel, an analyst for Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. ``It's fairly profitable.''
   The steep decline of the U.S. currency has many traders
explaining why the dollar should be falling, focusing mainly on the
massive U.S. trade deficit.
   The explanations may well be correct. But only last month, when
the dollar was surging upward, some of these same traders were
offering explanations to justify the rise.
   The truth is that traders care more about buying low and selling
high than they care about debates among economists over whether the
dollar is fundamentally overvalued or undervalued.

<HEAD>Coca-Cola Applies to Set Up Production Unit in India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co. applied to the Indian
government Wednesday for permission to set up a production unit in a
free trade zone near the capital, the company announced.
   The unit would manufacture ingredients for Coca-Cola concentrate
to be sold in markets outside India, according to a company
statement. But the company planned limited domestic sales of the
products, in accordance with rules governing export production in
free trade zones, the statement said.
   ``The project, if approved, would make India an important new
supply base for the company's expanding international operations,''
the statement said.
   The unit would cost the company 33 million rupees, or about $2.2
million, the statement said.
   Free trade zones are government-designated areas where companies
can set up manufacturing units with substantial tax and excise
reductions if most of the produce is exported.
   Coca-Cola withdrew from India in 1977 rather than follow
government directives to dilute its ownership and reveal its secret
formula.
   At that time, it had been operating for 27 years and had licensed
at least 20 companies to bottle its soft drinks.
   The Coca-Cola bid comes almost two months after Pepsico Inc. was
allowed to sell its soft drinks in Indian markets. In September, the
government approved a venture between Pepsico and two Indian
companies to produce processed foods and soft-drink concentrate.
   The Pepsico soft drinks are not expected on the market for at
least two years. The company made its proposal to the government in
June 1986, but it was not approved until two years later.
   Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, and Pepsico, based in Purchase,
N.Y., are the bigest soft drink makers in the United States.

   Michigan's request for federal protection from
Canadian automotive trade practices was rejected Wednesday by the
U.S. trade representative, who said state officials had no right to
file such a petition.
   Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, in his decision, also said
the state's request had been superceded by a free-trade agreement
negotiated between the United States and Canada.
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard asked Yeutter last month to declare
that Canada's duty-remissions program constituted an unfair and
illegal trade practice that discriminates against U.S. automotive
manufacturers.
   Under the program, Canada gives duty rebates on autos to foreign
manufacturers in return for the use of Canadian parts in their cars.
   The free-trade agreement, which is awaiting Canadian
parliamentary approval, would allow the Canadian rebate programs to
remain in place through 1996, a time-span U.S. critics say would
enable Canadian parts suppliers to build long-term ties with
foreign-owned manufacturers.
   ``Both the Free Trade Agreement and the U.S. legislation to
implement the agreeement specifically address the issue complained
of in the petition,'' Yeutter said. ``So (an) investigation now is
simply not appropriate.''
   He also said the law gives government officials no right to file
petitions under the legal provision cited by Michigan.
   ``The law is designed instead for petitions by private parties
that have a direct economic stake in the issues,'' Yeutter said.
   The trade representative has never accepted a petition under that
seciton of the law ``filed solely by a government official,'' he
said.
   Blanchard said he rejected Yeutter's contention that Michigan had
no right to file a petition.
   ``Nothing in the law or in the trade representative's own
implementing regulations precludes a state from filing a complaint
against unfair and illegal trade practices,'' Blanchard said. ``They
speak only to parties with `significant economic interest',
something which the state of Michigan has in this matter.''
   The director of the American Automotive Parts Association, a
trade group representing U.S. parts manufacturers, said his
organization was considering filing a petition of its own on behalf
of its members.
   Michigan's petition argued that the program discriminated against
U.S. parts purchases and amounted to an illegal subsidy of exports
of Canadian parts to the United States and other nations through
their inclusion in third-country automobiles.
   Canada gave $2.2 million in automotive duty remissions in its
1986-1987 fiscal year, and the practice would cost U.S. parts
manufacturers an estimated $132 million in business in 1990, the
state said.
   Large Japanese automakers, such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota,
benefited from the program in 1986 and 1987, the state said.
   The agreement has been approved by the Congress but was under
heavy attack in Canada's Parliament by opposition parties that
feared economic and cultural absorption of their nation by its large
southern neighbor.
   The issue figures heavily in the campaign leading up to Canada's
national elections on Monday.

<HEAD>US Coal Exports Through Seaway To Hit Six-Year High</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. coal exports from Great Lakes ports
traveling though the St. Lawrence Seaway more than tripled from
April through October compared with a year ago, seaway officials
said Wednesday.
   They said U.S. coal exports reached 569,000 metric tons from
April through October, compared with 165,000 metric tons for the
same period a year ago.
   The officials expressed optimism that the increase in coal
exports though the inland waterway will continue, resulting in a
six-year high at the end of the 1988 shipping season.
   The announcement came about a week after the seaway reported a
record amount of U.S. export steel would move through the channel by
yearend.
   U.S. coal exports through the seaway for all of 1987 totaled
234,000 metric tons. In 1985 and 1986, the highest years for coal
shipments through the seaway since 1982, coal exports just exceeded
600,000 tons each year. The 1982 total was 1.1 million metric tons.
   Spurring the demand for American-mined coal were: the lower value
of the dollar; competitive worldwide ocean freight rates; a tight
supply due to a series of industrial disputes last summer in
Australia; sanctions against using South African coal; and
production problems and rising production costs in Poland, the
seaway said in a news release.
   James L. Emery, administrator of the Saint Lawrence Seaway
Development Corp., which operates the U.S. portion of the
American-Canadian channel, credited 1986 seaway trade mission stops
in Norway and Denmark. The majority of U.S. export coal through the
system so far this year has been transported to Denmark for power
production, he said.
   ``Our visits to those countries provided Great Lakes coal
representatives the chance to build relationships with those looking
to buy coal,'' Emery said in a statement. ``No sooner did we get
back to the U.S. when our people in coal went back over to close new
deals.''
   Canada Steamshp Lines Inc., which participated in the 1986 trade
mission, has transported the majority of the coal through the seaway
this season, according to the release. As of Oct 31, it had moved
nearly 500,000 metric tons of U.S. coal from Lake Erie ports.
   Nationally, 1988 U.S. coal exports as of Aug. 31 totaled 52.2
million metric tons, up 15 percent from the same period last year,
according to the National Coal Association.
   The seaway begins at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and runs
through the Great Lakes, ending 2,342 miles later at Duluth, Minn.

<HEAD>Suggestion That Boesky Deceived Drexel in London Raises New
Questions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British securities fraud probe that suggests
Ivan Boesky duped Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. could give the
troubled firm a potent new attack on the credibility of the
imprisoned insider trader, who has implicated Drexel in illegal acts
and is expected to be a star witness against the investment house.
   Legal experts said Wednesday that the British investigation also
may mean new trouble for Boesky if he had not disclosed the alleged
fraud against Drexel to U.S. prosecutors when he negotiated a
plea-bargain agreement two years ago.
   Under that pact, Boesky is required to divulge all wrongdoing
even though he won't be indicted for it. But if he fails to be fully
candid, prosecutors can scrap the plea agreement and charge him with
every crime he had admitted.
   ``Certainly, if anything material was omitted by somebody under a
normal cooperation agreement, it would permit the prosecutor to
reopen the charges and do what he pleases,'' said a lawyer familiar
with the case, who spoke on the condition he not be identified by
name.
   Officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission and
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office would not comment on preliminary
results of the British probe, first reported in Wednesday editions
of the New York Times.
   Charles Carberry, a private attorney in New York and former
federal prosecutor who helped draft the Boesky plea agreement, also
declined to comment, as did Charles Davidow, a Boesky attorney in
Washington.
   Formerly Wall Street's best-known speculator, Boesky shocked the
business world two years ago when he paid the SEC a record $100
million to settle previously undisclosed charges of insider trading,
the misuse of secret information to profit in the financial markets.
   In exchange for his cooperation in implicating other wrongdoers,
Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge of
conspiracy to lie to the SEC, for which he began serving a
three-year term in March.
   Partly as a result of Boesky's disclosures, the SEC accused
Drexel Sept. 7 of numerous frauds, many involving an alleged scheme
to use the speculator as a front to profit from insider trading,
manipulate stocks and hide them in his name to avoid reporting
requirements, an illegal practice called stock parking. The
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is expected to seek criminal
charges against Drexel as well. The firm has denied any wrongdoing
and has denounced Boesky as a scheming liar.
   While the thrust of the U.S. allegations suggests Drexel
exploited Boesky for its benefit, the British stock exchange
investigation indicates Boesky was victimizing Drexel. Lawyers said
the British probe could boost Drexel's legal defense by convincing a
jury that Boesky was deceptive and conniving.
   ``Anything a witness has done that casts discredit on his honesty
is obviously useful to someone against whom that witness is
testifying,'' said Gerard Lynch, a Columbia Law School professor.
``That's especially true if the witness has gotten some deal from
the government.''
   Another attorney familiar with the Drexel-defense strategy, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ``If Boesky takes the stand,
he's going to be hammered about this ... It clearly helps Drexel's
case.''
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder, asked for comment about the
British probe, said, ``It would appear to us that if these
allegations are proven to be true, it is yet another example that
Ivan Boesky is unreliable and not believable.''
   The British probe suggests a Drexel-backed Boesky partnership
called Seemala Corp. broke an agreement with the firm and violated
stock reporting requirements by parking securities in a secret
account, unknown to Drexel.
   The probe also suggests the London brokerage Seligmann Harris &
Co. participated in Boesky's alleged scheme to cheat Drexel. Robert
Harris, the brokerage's senior partner, may face disciplinary
sanctions by the exchange.
   Harris was quoted by the New York Times as saying he didn't
knowingly break any rules and feels deceived by Boesky as well.
   There was no answer at Seligmann Harris's London office late
Wednesday. But Stanley Arkin, a New York lawyer retained by Harris,
said, ``It would be characteristic of Boesky to play both ends
against the middle.''

   Steel imports rose 8.2 percent to 16.1 million
tons in the first three quarters of the year compared with the same
period of 1987, two steel industry trade groups reported Wednesday.
   The American Iron and Steel Institute of Washington, D.C., which
represents U.S. steelmakers, said the 1988 imports thus far
represented 20.6 percent of the U.S. market, down from 21.2 percent
in the first three quarters of 1987.
   The American Institute for Imported Steel Inc. of New York, which
represents 70 leading steel importers, said imports for the first
nine months included 2.3 million tons of semifinished steel bound
for U.S. mills. Excluding the semifinished steel, the AIIS
calculated raw steel imports at 17.7 percent of the U.S. market.
   Both groups reported September steel imports, including
semifinished steel, at 1.6 million tons, representing about 19.7
percent of the U.S. market. The September figure is down from 1.8
million tons in August but up from 1.56 million tons in September
1987.
   The Reagan administration's Voluntary Restraints Agreements
import program seeks imports no higher than about 20.2 percent of
the apparent U.S. market. President-elect George Bush has promised
to extend the program beyond its current expiration on Sept. 30,
1989.

consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 187.90 million shares.
   Before the market opened the Commerce Department reported that

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Surge On Rumors of Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices surged Wednesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar
& Cocoa Exchange on rumors that the Ivory Coast and France had
reached an agreement to withhold a large amount of new-crop Ivorian
cocoa beans from the world market.
   On other exchanges, silver futures sagged but gold was little
changed; copper futures retreated; stock-index futures plunged;
grains were lower; soybeans were higher; and livestock, meat and
energy futures were mixed.
   Rumors of an impending cocoa pact between France and the Ivory
Coast have kept the cocoa market on edge for weeks. But on
Wednesday, the agreement was said to have been finalized and an
announcement was expected at any time.
   Cocoa settled $35 to $59 higher with the contract for delivery in
December at $1,392 per metric ton. The rally erased all of the
previous day's sharp losses.
   The Ivory Coast's policy of withholding its prized cocoa from the
market in an attempt to force prices higher hit a snag this fall
when the West African nation ran short of storage space for its
newly harvested crop, analysts said.
   The former French colony appealed to the French government and
has reportedly been negotiating for France's cooperation on a new
withholding plan.
   ``I would say they are very close to an agreement and may indeed
have reached one today,'' said Sandra Kaul, cocoa market analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
   She said she did not know the details, but it was rumored that a
large Paris-based trading house would buy a large quantity of
Ivorian cocoa, which it would withhold from the world market by
government command.
   Analyst Kim Badenhop of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York said the amount to be withheld from the market was rumored to
be 400,000 metric tons _ slightly less than two-thirds of the Ivory
Coast's new crop.
   ``That's taking a lot of cocoa off the market and the market's
been responding to that,'' he said.
   The speculation went that the Ivorians would try to sell the
remainder of their cocoa at prices above the world market price.
   But analysts said few market players expected the scheme to work.
   ``They won't be able to withhold as much as they want off the
market or to maintain the high asking price,'' Ms. Kaul said. ``No
one will give them money unless they drop their prices.''
   Silver futures slumped on New York's Commodity Exchange after
independent professional traders tried and failed to rally the price
for March delivery up to $6.60 a troy ounce, said Bernard Savaiko,
an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Gold was little changed despite the weakening of the dollar, a
bullish cue for precious metals.
   Gold settled unchanged to 40 cents higher with December at
$425.60 a troy ounce; silver was 9.3 cents lower across the board
with December at $6.30 a troy ounce.
   Near-month copper futures finished lower for the fourth time in
the last five sessions, but Savaiko said the selling was technically
motivated and supply-demand factors remained bullish.
   Copper settled 1.9 cents lower to 1.5 cents higher with December
at $1.28 a pound and the spot November contract at $1.35 a pound.
   Stock-index futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on fears that the Federal Reserve Board would respond to
signs of rising inflation by raising interest rates, analysts said.
   The contract for December delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
settled 4.45 points lower at 265.05.
   Grain futures settled mostly lower while soybeans finished mostly
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade in a quiet session that
appeared to mark the end of the recent selling wave, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 3 cents lower to 2 cents higher with December at
$4.10} a bushel; corn was unchanged to 2 cents lower with December
at $2.64\ a bushel; oats were 3\ cents to 5 cents lower with
December at $2.05\ a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 4
cents higher with November at $7.44\ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .10 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with December at 73.25 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .23 cent lower to .02 cent higher with November
at 81.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with December at 41.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .42 cent to .70 cent lower with February at 44.45 cents a pound.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled unchanged to 32 cents lower with December at
$13.67 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent lower to .09 cent higher
with December at 44.47 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .46
cent lower to .30 cent higher with December at 46.50 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>GEC, Siemens Launch $3 Billion Takeover Bid for Plessey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG
of West Germany launched a $3 billion takeover bid Wednesday for
electronics rival Plessey Co. PLC. Plessey promptly rejected the
offer.
   The bidders said competition from America and Asia made the
merger vital for the European electronics industry.
   GEC, which is unrelated to the U.S.-based General Electric Co.,
and Siemens offered 225 pence, or $4.07, a share for all of
Plessey's stock.
   But Plessey said it ``emphatically'' rejected the offer and
strongly recommended that its shareholders take no action on the bid.
   Its shares jumped 54 pence, or 97 cents, a share to 230 pence, or
$4.16, on the London Stock Exchange soon after the announcement.
   The bidders said in a statement that they were forming a joint
company, GEC Siemens PLC, to make the offer to Plessey.
   In the statement, they cited the approach of the 1992 removal of
trade barriers within the 12-country European Economic Community.
   ``Unless EC companies work together to make the most of available
European resources, they increasingly risk dependence on U.S. and
Japanese technology to retain any real market presence, even in the
short term,'' the statement said.
   GEC made a hostile 1.2 billion-pound bid for Plessey in 1986, but
the British government blocked it, saying the combination would grab
too large a slice of the British defense electronics business. The
bid was worth about $2 billion at the time.
   Following the failure of that bid, GEC and Plessey agreed to a
friendly merger of their telecommunications businesses, setting up
GEC Plessey Telecommunications Holdings Ltd., also known as GPT.
   But Siemens and GEC said the escalating cost of research and
development, scarce technical and managerial resources and
``relentless competition'' from the Far East and North America
prompted them to make the new bid.
   They said that if the bid succeeded, Siemens would take a
40-percent stake in GPT, with GEC holding the balance, and would
work together on telecommunications research and development.
   GPT and Siemens will maintain their existing telecommunications
product lines, particularly GPT's System X telephone switching
system and Siemens' EWSD switching system. But GPT and Siemens hope
successor systems will be developed jointly.
   ``Collaboration will encompass new products for the EC market,
and in particular for the massive U.S. market, where both companies
(GPT and Siemens) have achieved only limited success to date,'' GEC
and Siemens said.
   GEC plans to take a 50-percent stake in Siemens' defense
electronics business and a 51-percent stake in Plessey's recently
acquired U.S. defense electronics interests. Plessey agreed in July
to buy the defense interests of Singer Co. for $310 million.
   To allay any government concerns about a monopoly, the statement
said, Plessey will continue to operate as a separate entity in
Europe but will be able to call on Siemens products and technology.

   The dollar plunged along with stocks and bonds
Wednesday as bearish sentiment overwhelmed the government's report
of a narrowing of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit.
   ``The trade numbers weren't really that bad, but the market
sentiment was to push the dollar down no matter what,'' said Bill
Hand, a currency trader at First Pennsylvania Bank in Philadelphia.
   The dollar registered its lowest close against the Japanese yen
in New York trading since modern exchange rates were established in
the late 1940s, falling nearly 1 percent to 122.24 yen. The dollar
closed lower once in Tokyo, on Jan. 4 of this year, when it finished
at 121.65.
   The dollar also fell 1.5 percent against the West German mark,
1.4 percent against the British pound, 1.3 percent against the
French franc and 1.4 percent against the Swiss franc. It reached
nearly six-month lows against some European currencies.
   The Commerce Department reported early Wednesday that the trade
deficit narrowed to $10.5 billion in September, which was roughly in
line with expectations of $9 billion to $11 billion.
   Traders' immediate reaction was to send the dollar and bonds
higher. But the underlying bearish sentiment soon took hold and the
dollar edged downward throughout the day.
   Traders selling dollars defied two reported attempts by the
Federal Reserve to stabilize the currency through dollar purchases.
   The dollar's decline hurt stocks and bonds, and in turn the
weakness in those markets helped send the dollar lower, said Phillip
Eriksen, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco.
   ``This is the first time we've seen the bond market, the stock
market and the foreign exchange market all going down at the same
time. They're all focusing on each other,'' Eriksen said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 38.59 to
2,038.58, its lowest close since it stood at 2,002.31 on Sept. 1.
   In the bond market, the yield of the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond jumped to 9.11 percent in late trading from 9.01 percent late
Tuesday. Bond yields rise when prices fall and are a good indicator
of overall interest rate trends. The trade report showed a record
level of U.S. exports and a 2.5 percent decline in imports from the
August record. But the deficit's decline was not enough to comfort
traders who have shown increasing concerns about the federal budget
deficit and the United States' dependence on inflows of foreign
capital.
   ``In many respects, this is one of the least important trade
numbers we've seen in a long time,'' said Stephen Leach, a currency
analyst at Chemical Bank.
   Remarks by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan were
also interpreted negatively for the dollar, dealers said.
   Answering questions before the U.S. National Economic Commission,
Greenspan said the United States cannot grow out of its budget
deficit. Greenspan said the financial markets appear to be waiting
for firm deficit reduction proposals from Congress.
   In Tokyo, where trading ended before the trade number was
released, the dollar rose 0.29 yen to a closing 123.54 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted at 123.40 yen. In New York, the dollar sank to
122.24 yen from 123.23 yen late Tuesday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which rose
to $1.8225 from $1.8060 late Tuesday. The dollar also fell in New
York against the pound, which rose to $1.8338 from $1.8083.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.7164 West German marks, down from 1.7433;
1.4422 Swiss francs, down from 1.4626; 1.2296 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2337; 5.8770 French francs, down from 5.9535; and 1,277.75
Italian lire, down from 1,297.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.7230 West German marks, down from 1.7465;
1.4465 Swiss francs, down from 1.4630; 5.8975 French francs, down
from 5.9660; 1.9575 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9685; 1,291.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,300.50; and 1.2305 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2344.
   Gold prices rose in most markets.
   At the start of the trading day in Hong Kong, gold fell 38 cents
a troy ounce to close at a bid of $423.69 a troy ounce.
   Later, gold rose in London to a late bid of $425.50 a troy ounce,
compared with $423.75 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to close at
a bid $425.40 an ounce compared with $423.00 late Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $424.50 a troy ounce from $424.40 an ounce late
Tuesday.
   Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was
bid at $423.60 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $423.00 late
Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid of $6.39 a troy ounce, compared with
Tuesday's $6.41. On New York's Comex, silver bullion fell to $6.277
a troy ounce from $6.368 an ounce Tuesday.

<HEAD>Raleses Say They're Close to Abandoning $2.7 Billion Hostile Bid
for Interco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group waging a $2.7 billion hostile
takeover bid for Interco Inc. said it was close to scrapping the bid
late Wednesday because of the furniture-apparel company's stiff
resistance.
   Cardinal Acquisition Corp., a group controlled by Mitchell and
Steven Rales of Washington, D.C., said it was preparing to abandon a
$74-a-share cash tender offer as of midnight EST and return all
tendered shares, which amounted to nearly 90 percent of the
company's 35.56 million shares outstanding.
   Interco's stock price fell $1.87{ a share to $63.37{ in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Cardinal's announcement came two days after Interco, a St.
Louis-based maker and seller of products including Florsheim shoes,
London Fog raincoats and Ethan Allen furniture, rejected another
request for negotiations.
   Interco also indicated at that time that it planned to undertake
a defensive restructuring, which includes payment of a special
dividend and the sale of some of its major businesses, even if
Cardinal dropped its offer.
   Abandoning the bid would end the Rales' four-month fight to
acquire Interco, which has rebuffed their maneuvers since an initial
$64-a-share offer they made in July.
   Interco responded with a defensive restructuring plan that would
cost $2.8 billion, pay shareholders a special dividend, plunge the
company into debt and require the sale of some businesses to help
pay it off.
   The battle also extended into the courts of Delaware, where
Interco is incorporated, when the Rales sought to invalidate a
so-called ``poison pill'' company bylaw that would make a hostile
purchase prohibitively expensive.
   Although the Delaware Chancery Court prohibited Interco from
using the poison pill defense in a ruling earlier this month, the
company appealed to the state supreme court, which agreed to hear
the matter Nov. 30.
   The Raleses have indicated previously they would not buy any
Interco shares until the issue was resolved.
   Interco employs about 54,000 people nationwide and had sales of
$3.34 billion last year.

   The chairman of the Polaroid Corp. ended
his testimony Wednesday as the trial in which the instant
camera-maker is hoping to fend off a hostile takeover drew closer to
an end.
   Under cross examination, Chairman I. MacAllister Booth defended
Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan that would all but block a
takeover because it puts 14 percent of Polaroid's stock in the hands
of employees.
   Booth reiterated earlier testimony that the plan was put in place
to give workers ``a piece of the rock'' and increase the company's
financial performance.
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court and
is asking Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger to overturn the
10-million-share, $300 million stock plan.
   Shamrock is controlled by the Disney family and is based in
Burbank, Calif. On July 19, Shamrock made a friendly $40-a-share bid
that was rejected. It later made a hostile bid at $42 per share.
   Polaroid, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., but incorporated in
Delaware, has urged its shareholders to reject the hostile bid. The
takeover hinges on the outcome of the trial.
   Ms. Berger is expected to rule soon on whether there will be
further testimony.

<TEXT>
   Morrison Knudsen Corp. has begun
``substantive negotiations'' with a management-led group of
employees interested in buying its National Steel and Shipbuilding
Co. subsidiary.
   The San Diego-based subsidiary accounted for $19.9 million of
Morrison Knudsen's $55 million loss in operating income during the
first nine months of this year, Morrison Knudsen spokesman Vern
Nelson said Wednesday.
   During the same period, National Steel and Shipbuilding's revenue
of $133 million represented less than 10 percent of Morrison
Knudsen's $1.5 billion in revenue.
   ``We believe the sale of NASSCO would be in the best interests of
the employees, as well as those of the community of San Diego and
(Morrison Knudsen),'' William Agee, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of Morrison Knudsen, said in a statement.
   He said the transaction is subject to working out terms of a
definitive sales agreement, as well as the resolution of contract
issues between Morrison Knudsen and the Department of the Navy.
   ``It would save jobs and benefit San Diego, important objectives
for us,'' Agee said. ``To that end, we're doing everything possible
to reach a timely and fair resolution in our discussions both with
the NASSCO executive team and the Navy.''
   No details were released, but Agee said Morrison Knudsen probably
would retain a minority ownership position in NASSCO. Any such
transaction would result in a one-time charge against Morrison
Knudsen's earnings, he said.
   NASSCO posted operating income of $900,000 during the first
quarter of 1988, but lost $19.9 million in the second quarter and
another $900,000 during the third quarter, which ended Oct. 30.
   The Navy recently exercised an option to have NASSCO build a
second fast combat support ship. When that work is fully underway,
the company expects to be employing about 2,500 people.
   Morrison Knudsen is a major construction, engineering and
shipbuilding corporation with headquarters in Boise, Idaho.

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials of Holly Farms Corp. and
rival poultry producer Tyson Foods Inc. have met to discuss Tyson's
proposed $941 million buyout offer but no decisions were reached, a
Tyson spokesman said Wednesday.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry producer, has been trying
since Oct. 18 to take over Holly Farms, but directors of the
Memphis-based company have spurned those advances.
   In its latest bid, Tyson offered $52 a share for Holly Farms'
18.1 million shares of common stock. Tyson has made the $941 million
offer directly to Holly Farms stockholders but still is seeking the
blessing of the company's board of directors.
   The rejections of Tyson's offers have been curt, and Holly Farms
president Lee Taylor reportedly has refused to return phone calls to
Tyson chairman Don Tyson of Springdale, Ark.
   But Bob Justice, a spokesman for Tyson, said the two executives
and their top assistants met Tuesday in Memphis.
   ``We're pleased with the meeting as far as Mr. Tyson is
concerned,'' Justice said.
   Ted Bailey, a spokesman for Holly Farms, confirmed that the
meeting took place but declined comment on what was discussed.
   ``The Tyson people were at our office yesterday,'' he said.
   Bailey also declined to say if other meetings are planned, but
Justice said Holly Farms' officers have agreed to present their
board of directors with Tyson's offer.
   ``We were assured that the information and the discussions
between the two companies would be provided to the board of
directors,'' Justice said.
   Bailey declined to say if a board meeting was scheduled.
   Tyson's offer expires Nov. 18.
   In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Holly Farms
fell 75 cents a share to $52.75.
   Justice said Tyson will continue its takeover efforts whether the
Holly Farms board approves the deal or not.
   Holly Farms is a diversified foods company with about half of its
sales in chicken. The company had total sales of $1.6 billion last
year.
   Tyson had gross sales last year of $1.8 billion.

   International Multifoods Corp. has paid $53.8
million to buy back the 12.1 percent of its stock held by a group
led by Bregman Partners of Toronto, Ontario, the food company
announced Wednesday.
   Multifoods has paid $30.75 a share for 1,751,000 shares of
Multifoods common stock previously owned by Bregman Partners and its
affiliates, which last year indicated it might acquire up to 24.9
percent of the company's stock.
   Multifoods stock closed Wednesday at $30.62{, down 37{ cents a
share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Multifoods could repurchase up to 500,000 additional shares of
its common stock under a plan approved by the board of directors,
the company said.
   Bregman Partners never made a tender offer to acquire Multifoods,
but it said more than a year ago in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it intended to buy more than 24.9 percent
of Multifoods' outstanding shares.
   According to its most recent SEC filing, Bregman had purchased
only 12.1 percent of the shares.
   ``To the best of our knowledge we have purchased all of their
holdings,'' said Linda Berg, a Multifoods spokeswoman. ``You never
knew what their motives were.''
   Bregman Partners, which includes the Belzberg banking family of
Vancouver, British Columbia, could not be reached for comment. The
investment group earlier had suggested that Multifoods restructure
its business but Multifoods Chairman Andre Gillette rejected the
idea as a ``misleading and thinly disguised self-serving effort.''
   In late July, the Canadian group proposed a restructuring in
which Multifoods would sell its U.S. grain merchandising, Mister
Donut chain and Canadian operations other than industrial and
consumer flour opeations to raise $120 million.
   The partnership also proposed that the company borrow $270
million and pay a special dividend of $28 in cash plus $6 in notes
to the holders of its 14.6 million shares.
   In rejecting the offer, Gillet proposed then to buy back the
stock held by the partnership for $32 a share, the closing price of
the stock on the previous day.
   Multifoods, which nearly doubled its earnings from continuing
operations in fiscal 1988, has divested itself of its regional
consumer food companies and flour mills in the United States in the
past three years. It also has acquired and consolidated companies
that have given it a prominent position in the production and
distribution of food for the hospitality industry and vending
machines.

<TEXT>
   Navistar International Corp. sold its failing
Wisconsin Steel subsidiary to avoid paying pensions and must give
millions of dollars to the federal agency that is providing those
benefits, a judge ruled Wednesday.
   The decision by U.S. District Court Judge James Moran favored the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which has been paying the pensions
of former Wisconsin Steel workers since the Chicago mill collapsed
in 1980.
   ``This ruling sends a warning, loud and clear, to any others who
may be tempted to try to unload their pension responsibilities, that
abusive tactics will not be tolerated,'' PBGC attorney Gary Ford
said.
   Navistar spokeswoman Roxanne Decyk said, ``We feel that the very
narrow finding of liability will be overturned on appeal.''
   Moran's ruling came four months after the close of a nine-week
trial on the case.
   Navistar _ the former International Harvester _ in 1977 sold
Wisconsin Steel to Envirodyne Inc., a Los Angeles engineering
company with no previous steel-making experience.
   The mill, which employed at least 3,500 workers, went bankrupt
three years later. The pension fund was lost, and PBGC had to pay
the workers' pension benefits.
   PBGC is a federal agency created to guarantee payment of pension
benefits to workers participating in private defined benefit pension
plans. The agency now pays $7.7 million per year to 2,000 former
Wisconsin Steel workers, said agency spokeswoman Jane Hoden in
Washington.
   In its lawsuit, the agency had asked for $146 million from
Navistar _ $63 million in Wisconsin Steel pensions plus interest _
but the exact amount of damages will be determined at a later date,
Ms. Hoden said.
   Navistar has denied that it duped Envirodyne into purchasing
Wisconsin Steel for $65 million, with a $50 million loan from
Navistar. The sale was part of Navistar's move out of the steel
business in order to concentrate on its core farm-equipment and
truck-manufacturing businesses, the company has said.
   The case is considered an important test of whether a company can
be forced to honor pension-plan obligations to workers.
   ``At present we are monitoring several transactions by
companies,'' Ford said. ``This ruling will strengthen our ability to
deal with what we view as abuses of the pension-insurance program.''
   During the trial, Navistar attorneys said Wisconsin Steel's
demise stemmed from many factors, including two harsh winters and a
six-month strike at Navistar, a Wisconsin Steel customer,
immediately before the mill collapsed.
   Last February, Navistar agreed to pay $14.8 million to 2,700
former Wisconsin Steel workers for benefits lost when the mill filed
for bankruptcy under Envirodyne's ownership.
   Wisconsin Steel creditors, led by an Envirodyne unit, the EDC
Holding Co., have filed a separate lawsuit seeking $475 million from
Navistar.
