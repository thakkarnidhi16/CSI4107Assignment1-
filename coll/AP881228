<HEAD>Angry Reaction To Mayor's Comment Holding Hirohito Responsible For
War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAGASAKI, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A comment by Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima that
Emperor Hirohito shared responsibility for World War II has sparked
angry rallies against the city leader and calls for his ouster.
   At a City Council meeting earlier this month, Motoshima was asked
what he thought about the 87-year-old emperor's role in the war.
   Judging from historical accounts and his own wartime experience,
Motoshima said, ``I believe the emperor shares responsibility for
the war, as well as all of us who lived in that period.''
   Coming on the 47th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor,
the comments were seen as especially inappropriate by Japanese, who
consider it despicable to criticize a suffering person. Hirohito has
been seriously ill with intestinal bleeding for three months.
   On Dec. 21 and 22, about 100 sound trucks surrounded City Hall
and about 260 radical rightists wearing military-style uniforms were
present.
   A delegation from the Liberal Democratic Party, which controls
the national government and had backed the indepependent Motoshima
since he took office in 1979, demanded the mayor retract the
comments. Motoshima has refused.
   ``How can I take it back when I said what I believe?'' he asked.
``I feel the withdrawal of my statement would endanger the hard-won
freedom of speech in this country.''
   His view of the emperor's partial responsibility for the war is
believed widely held among Japanese, especially intellectuals.
   Hirohito was a figurehead while real power was held by
militarists, but he was able to decide to end the war when the
government was evenly divided in August 1945, after the United
States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   In Nagasaki on that Aug. 9, more than 70,000 people died, about
35 percent of the city's population. In Hiroshima, which took the
first bomb Aug. 6, the death toll was about 140,000.

<HEAD>Millennium Year Gives Dublin Its Biggest Face Lift</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dublin's millennium celebration has been a
great success, city leaders say, putting the fair back into the
``fair city'' with its biggest face lift ever.
   The year-long birthday party, with more than 1,000 events ranging
from cultural extravaganzas to sporting matches, also boosted
tourism, business and jobs, organizers say.
   Critics complain the festival was badly organized and ignored
most of Dublin and the rest of Ireland. Some say Dublin actually is
much older than 1,000 years and that the date was blarney,
arbitrarily chosen to draw tourists.
   ``When we came into the Dublin event it was a time of national
pessimism here,'' said Matt McNulty, managing director of the
festival. ``People said, `What is there to celebrate? Dublin looks
terrible.'''
   The capital of 1 million people had become grimy and derelict.
Vandalism and littering was rampant. Unemployment near 20 percent
bred widespread poverty.
   Persistent rain and occasional smog from coal-burning fires
almost obscure the large squares, the grand Georgian buildings and
the brightly colored doors studded with brass knockers and topped
with fanlights.
   ``But better to light a candle than curse the dark,'' says
McNulty, so cityscape improvements became the focus of the
millennium.
   The site has been inhabited for 5,000 years, and the Danes built
a maritime settlement here in 841. The millennium celebrates the
capture of Dublin by Celtic monarch Mael Sechnaill from the Vikings
in 988.
   ``We tried to plan a number of things that were permanent. We
felt we would be judged more on the things that were left behind,''
McNulty said.
   The government's big projects were to repave the center aisle of
O'Connell Street, Dublin's once-graceful main boulevard that had
degenerated into a neon-and-plastic strip, and to turn Grafton
Street, a principal shopping street, into a pedestrian mall.
   O'Connell Street ``is no longer ticky tacky,'' said Lord Mayor
Ben Briscoe. ``It's a beautiful street once again.''
   About 70 shop fronts have been spruced up, 180 buildings floodlit
and countless others cleaned around the city during the year,
McNulty said.
   Dublin has been given 10,000 new trees and three new parks. One
of them commemorates Dublin's great writers, including James Joyce,
Oscar Wilde and W.B. Yeats. It was funded by Irish Distillers Group
PLC, because ``most of our writers were good customers of the
publicans,'' McNulty said.
   The mayor's Georgian Mansion House, built in 1705, was
refurbished and the 197-year-old Custom House is being restored.
   Twelve statues have been unveiled, funded by Irish companies in
the 19th century spirit of industrialists endowing the city with art.
   The centerpiece is a combination statue-fountain called Anna
Livia, the name the Joyce gave to Dublin's River Liffey. It's not to
everyone's taste, and Dublin wits were quick to nickname it ``the
Floozy in the Jacuzzi.''
   ``If you look at a photograph of the Taj Mahal, you know you are
looking at India. Dublin doesn't have a lot of things that are
widely, internationally known. She (Anna Livia) will certainly help
that,'' McNulty said.
   City Manager Frank Feely, who conceived the festival, said: ``To
me, the most important thing about the millennum was to put the city
on show for itself. That's all the good for the future because if
people are proud of their city they take better care of it. It will
inspire confidence.''
   Publican Shane Finnegan said, ``It's had a great impact.''
   But Partick Carroll, an engineering student, felt differently.
``All of the millennium has been concentrated on the central portion
(of Dublin). The rest of it is totally neglected,'' he said.
   Tourism rose more than 13 percent in 1988 from the previous
year's 2 million visitors, McNulty said. He had hoped for a 10
percent gain.
   Dublin tourism revenue was about $227 million in 1988, up from
$196 million last year, he said.
   Direct projects created 130 potentially permanent jobs, plus jobs
at many Irish businesses, McNulty said.
   Taxi driver Joe Higgins said the festival helped his business,
but complained about the planning. He said he hadn't been given
literature early on to help guide passengers to sites and events.
   Jimmy O'Neill, a bank employee, said: ``Country people are a bit
fed up with it, getting left out. Because Dublin was the capital,
they should have made it more relevant to the whole country.''
   The 26-year-old claims to have had the best idea of all, and
shared it over a pint of Guinness, the national drink, at one of
Dublin's many boisterous pubs.
   ``Free drink for a week, that's what they should have done,'' he
said.

   Four months after the Roxbury neighborhood was
galvanized by the killing of an 11-year-old girl caught in crossfire
from rival drug gangs, the area has been shaken by three fatal
shootings over Christmas.
   ``I'm so tired of going to funerals for my students,'' said
teacher Cynthia Swamigan. ``To see these kids in coffins is
devastating.''
   More than 400 people attended the funeral in August for Tiffany
Moore, who was shot twice in the head while sitting on a corner
mailbox talking to friends.
   The slaying sparked an outcry for more police protection in the
lower-income neighborhood where a large percentage of the city's
blacks live, but community leaders say drug-related violence in the
area is worsening anyway. Some say there are signs of growing gang
activity patterned after Los Angeles-style ``color'' gangs.
   On Christmas Eve, the body of 35-year-old Manuel D. Winslow was
discovered in an abandoned apartment. He had been shot twice in the
head. A man told police he saw two men park a BMW in front of the
building and take two rifles from the trunk.
   On Christmas night, high school basketball star Michael Bennett,
18, was fatally shot in the neck as drove in the neighboring
Mattapan section. A revolver was in his pocket and a handgun behind
the driver's seat. Police believe the shooting was gang-related.
   On the same night, Inacio Mendes, 43, was fatally shot as he
stood in front of a window in his kitchen, police said. His
apartment is a block from the street where Tiffany was killed and
where repairmen and taxi drivers sometimes refuse to go.
   A police spokesman, James Jordan, said he was certain the gunman
intended to hit someone else.
   ``We're in big trouble here,'' said community leader Ben Haith of
the Roxbury Multi-Service Center. ``We're becoming like L.A.''
   Boston police spokeswoman Jill Reilly said any comparison of
gangs in Boston and Los Angeles is inappropriate. Los Angeles had
300 gang-related homicides this year, compared with Boston's two or
three, she said.
   The 30 additional officers assigned to the bustling, inner-city
area since Tiffany's death are not enough to stop the escalating
drug trade and a citywide homicide total that has jumped 33 percent
over last year, neighborhood activists said.
   Haith complained that the city's response has been little more
than a token. While a police cruiser is now usually stationed in a
vacant lot across the street from where Tiffany was shot, it rarely
moves and the officers do not leave the car, he said, prompting
neighbors to joke that the cruiser was sent to guard the mailbox.
   ``It just sits there,'' he said. ``The criminals already know
their routines and they just avoid them.''
   According to the police report on the Mendes killing, a youth
wearing a red cap and red jacket with a yellow stripe across the
back was seen running near the house immediately after the shooting.
   Ed Brooks, who heads the Community Patrol, a group of about 30
residents who patrol hotspots and report tips to police, said the
clothing description fits that of a gang operating in the area.
   Brooks said there are signs that Los Angeles-style ``color''
gangs are appearing in Boston. There are more than a dozen violent
gangs that sell cocaine, crack and heroin, carry guns and wear
different colored hoods or jackets to identify themselves, he said.
   He warned that gang activity is increasing, and ``if somebody
don't do something, the murders we have now could triple.''
   ``We know we can only be nonviolent for so long,'' Brooks said.
``We don't want to be a vigilante group but I can see in not too
long, there are going to be some folks who want to go out there and
hurt someone to take our neighborhood back.''

<TEXT>
   The 74-year-old widow of Mao Tse-tung is
critically ill in prison, where she is serving a life term for her
role in the Cultural Revolution, an official newspaper reported
today.
   The China Daily quoted a Justice Ministry official as saying
Jiang Qing is receiving treatment in prison for unspecified diseases
relating to old age. It denied persistent reports she suffers from
throat cancer.
   Last week, China Youth, an official monthly, said Jiang had left
prison and was being treated in a hospital for throat cancer. The
ministry also denied that report.
   Jiang was arrested in October 1976, a month after Mao died, and
was branded the chief villainess of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution,
when millions of Chinese were persecuted or had their lives
disrupted by ultra-leftist factions.
   She was accused of being ringleader of the ``Gang of Four'' that
tried to seize power after Mao's death. In 1981, she was sentenced
to death but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1983.

<HEAD>Chances Diminish That Mubarak Will Visit Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURICE GUINDI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chances that President Hosni Mubarak would be
the first Arab leader to visit Israel since Anwar Sadat have
diminished over his government's insistence that Israel talk first
to the PLO.
   Israel refuses to engage in any dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which it views as a terrorist group.
   Butros Ghali, the top Cabinet minister and Egypt's second-ranking
diplomat, said Tuesday that Israel must talk to the PLO before
Mubarak will visit the Jewish state. But Israel repeated its demand
that a Mubarak visit be made without preconditions.
   ``Egypt always has emphasized the importance of dialogue and
contact between the PLO and Israel,'' Ghali, minister of state for
foreign affairs, told reporters in Cairo. ``In light of this
objective, President Hosni Mubarak is prepared to visit Israel if it
agrees to dialogue with the PLO.''
   Government sources supported Ghali's statement, saying a Mubarak
visit to Israel was ``almost unimaginable'' unless Jerusalem
reverses its opposition to an international peace conference and
accepts the PLO as a negotiating partner.
   In interviews with foreign newspapers last weekend, Mubarak made
a qualified offer to travel to Israel if it would help achieve peace.
   He was quoted as telling the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Anbaa, ``If
this visit would lead to solving the problem, and if it would lead
to establishing a just peace, then I am ready.''
   The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri quoted Mubarak as saying said he
would visit Israel if the peace prospects appeared good, but said he
would do so without ``preconditions.''
   Israel responded positively to the offer, but Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir emphasized the visit would have to be made without
preconditions from the Egyptian side as well. He repeated that
demand Tuesday.
   ``I will be happy to receive him (Mubarak),'' Shamir said on
Israel radio but added, ``These visits usually have to be prepared
with caution, not in the limelight, and without preconditions.''
   Other Israeli officials tried to play down the probability of a
Mubarak visit. One Israeli Foreign Ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Mubarak's statement ``was given much
more importance than Mubarak meant.''
   Ghali was among the architects of the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace
treaty, the only one between an Arab county and the Jewish state. He
has held his ministerial post since Sadat's daring 1977 visit to
Israel to launch the peace initiative that culminated in the Camp
David accords. Sadat was assassinated by Moslem extremists four
years later, in part because of his peace mission.
   In making his statement Tuesday, Ghali cited ``the initiative
taken by PLO leader Yasser Arafat'' in recognizing Israel's right to
exist.
   Arafat's explicit recognition of Israel's right to exist and
renunciation of terrorism earlier this month led the United States
to reverse a 13-year policy and agree to open a dialogue with the
PLO.
   In another development, Arafat scoffed at an Israeli plan to give
limited autonomy to the Palestinians in the occupied territories,
calling it ``an undesired commodity in a stagnated market.''
   Speaking in Iraq after a three-day session of the PLO Executive
Committee, Arafat said Shamir ``should understand that he cannot
sell us Camp David after everybody has rejected it.'' He was
referring to Shamir's proposal to grant the West Bank and Gaza Strip
autonomy as stipulated in the 1979 treaty.
   Shamir said Sunday that Israel would work toward an agreement
with Egypt and Jordan on self-rule for Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza, captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   If such an agreement were reached, he said, he would allow free
elections for an adminstrative council to run Palestinian affairs in
the territories.

   Country music star Johnny Cash was joking
with hospital staff and doing well despite suffering some pulmonary
problems after heart surgery, hospital officials said.
   Baptist Hospital spokeswoman Aileen Katcher said doctors would
not release more specific information about Cash's setback early in
the weekend.
   ``The only thing more I can say is that he had problems with his
lungs,'' she said Tuesday. ``The doctor says it doesn't happen to
all (bypass) patients, but it's not unusual.''
   Cash, 56, remained in intensive care following double-bypass
surgery Dec. 19.
   ``He is up and walking around. He's doing well,'' said another
hospital spokeswoman, Debbie Koch. ``He was joking with hospital
staff and seemed in good spirits.''
   Cash, known for such songs as ``A Boy Named Sue'' and ``I Walk
the Line,'' was expected to remain hospitalized through the week,
doctors said.

   Entertainer Engelbert Humperdinck has filed a
$50 million-plus libel suit against the National Enquirer, claiming
the tabloid held him up to hatred and ridicule when it falsely
reported he had AIDS.
   The Superior Court suit filed Tuesday by Humperdinck's lawyer,
Robert Rotstein, states the singer doesn't have acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. Furthermore, it said, he has never tested
positive for AIDS.
   The National Enquirer, a weekly supermarket tabloid that boasts
the largest circulation of any paper in America, said in the
headline over the Dec. 27, 1988, story ``Engelbert Has AIDS Virus.''
   ``In shocking court papers, the mother of Engelbert Humperdinck's
illegitimate daughter declares that the superstar singer is battling
the AIDS virus,'' the Lantana, Fla.-based National Enquirer said.
   Kathy Jetter filed papers in New York City's Family Court
demanding that Humperdinck, 52, provide for the financial future of
her 12-year-old daughter, already ruled by a court to be his
daughter.
   The woman's unsubstantiated and false claims about the
entertainer in a reply affidavit in the case were ultimately
dismissed by the New York court, which the tabloid failed to report,
Humperdinck's libel suit said.
   ``The article is libelous on its face, exposing the plaintiff to
hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy,'' the suit said, adding
there was malice because the tabloid ``made the statements with
knowledge that they were false or with reckless disregard for their
truth or falsity.''
   The National Enquirer headquarters were closed Tuesday evening
and a security guard said no one was available for comment.

   Comedian Richard Pryor is being sued by a
woman who says he fathered her baby out of wedlock and wants $10,745
monthly to support herself and the 20-month-old child.
   Geraldine Mason's paternity suit, filed Friday in Superior Court
by celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, said she was nearly
destitute and unable to live on the $1,000 a month Pryor has been
paying her.
   Miss Mason, an actress-model whose age wasn't disclosed in court
documents, met Pryor in 1985 while she was working as a show girl
extra on the movie ``Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling You,'' the
suit said.
   When told in 1986 that she was pregnant with his child, ``Richard
was livid and he told me that he did not want to see me anymore,
especially when I was pregnant,'' Miss Mason said.
   Several telephone calls to attorney Lance Spiegel, who represents
Pryor, were not returned Tuesday.
   Franklin Matthew Mason was born April 29, 1987, and soon
afterward Pryor renewed the couple's relationship, giving her in
excess of $65,000 during a six-month period ending in January 1988,
the lawsuit said.
   ``Franklin should be able to enjoy a life with me similar to the
lifestyle his father maintains,'' Miss Mason said, explaining her
$4,500-a-month rent request.
   Among other expenses totaling $10,745 monthly, the suit also
specifies clothing needs of $700 a month and beauty shop bills
totaling $250 monthly.

<HEAD>Reagan Checks Out New Office With Pacific View</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, who has worked nearly eight
years in an oval-shaped office near the Potomac River, is looking
forward to settling down in a rectangular one with a view of the
Pacific Ocean.
   Reagan, on the fifth day of a two-week California vacation, paid
his first visit Tuesday to the office he will use after his term
ends Jan. 20. The office, not yet fully furnished, is on the top
floor of a 34-story building about five minutes by car from where
the Reagans will live.
   Reporters were not allowed to accompany the president into the
building, but assistant White House press secretary Mark Weinberg
quoted him as saying, ``It's a beautiful office with a spectacular
view and it even has four corners. I'm looking forward to spending
time there.''
   The president's right hand was scratched while unpacking a box of
books in the office, Weinberg said after reporters noticed two small
bandages on his fingers as he waved to them while leaving.
   Reagan spent about 45 minutes in the office.
   Weinberg said the president made decisions about the office
several months ago and the purpose of Tuesday's visit was to see
that the arrangements were made as he wished.
   The office is down the hall from the office of the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Foundation, which is overseeing construction of the
Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley northwest of Los Angeles.
On the same floor are offices for first lady Nancy Reagan and for
the Secret Service.
   Expenses for former presidents are paid out of a budget provided
by Congress.
   The Reagans will fly to Palm Springs on Thursday and see the new
year in as usual at the home of publisher Walter Annenberg in nearby
Rancho Mirage. They will return to their future home in Los Angeles
on Jan. 1 and will fly back to Washington on Jan. 5.
   On Tuesday, Reagan issued a statement marking the ninth
anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He said he
expects the Soviets to live up to their target date of Feb. 15 for
withdrawal of all of their troops, but added, ``The introduction of
new weapons, and the escalation in the use of Soviet warplanes in
bombing raids against Afghanistan, call into question the Soviet
commitment to a peaceful solution.''
   One decision awaiting the president, possibly before his return
to Washington, is whether to approve or modify the recommendations
of the Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries,
which call for increases averaging 50 percent for the 2,500 top
officials of the government.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Leslye Arsht said ``I don't
know what the president's intentions are.'' She said she did not
expect a decision this week.

<TEXT>
   If you go on a job interview today and are
asked to take a lie detector test, the chances are you would be the
victim of an illegal act.
   The same situation applies if your boss has a polygraph examiner
come into the warehouse tomorrow to hook wires to randomly selected
employees and question them about merchandise missing from the
company's shelves.
   It is now illegal across America for most employers in interstate
commerce to use the controversial polygraph for pre-employment
screening purposes or to use them randomly against workers already
on their payroll.
   These restrictions on lie detectors, whose accuracy has long been
under attack, are enumerated in a federal law that took effect
Tuesday, six months after it was signed by President Reagan.
   ``This is a holiday gift for working people,'' said Judy
Goldberg, legislative representative for the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   ``We expect that the new law will ban 80 percent of the
approximately 2 million polygraph tests given annually,'' Goldberg
said in a prepared statement.
   The law's restrictions will be felt most heavily in 28 states
that lack their own statutes restricting the use of lie detectors,
Goldberg said.
   Not covered by the new rules, however, are federal, state and
local governments and firms doing sensitive work under contract to
the Defense Department, FBI and CIA.
   The only other private-sector exceptions to the general ban apply
to companies that manufacture, distribute or dispense controlled
substances and some types of firms in the security guard, armored
car or security alarm fields.
   The law prohibits an employee from being fired, disciplined or
discriminated against solely for refusing to submit to a polygraph
examination.
   An employer can request an employee to take a lie detector test
if the worker had access to missing or damaged material and if the
employer sets forth in a written statement a reasonable suspicion
that the worker was involved in the loss.
   Any such polygraph exam would have to be conducted under strict
conditions, with no questions about personal beliefs and sexual
behavior, and the exam results alone could not be used as a basis
for discipline or a refusal to hire.
   ``Complaints about polygraph abuse and firings based on polygraph
abuse have been one of the single largest sources of calls to ACLU
offices nationwide,'' Goldberg said.
   ``Now employees can complain to the Department of Labor or go
into court to protect themselves against these inaccurate gadgets,''
Goldberg said.
   She said the law would have the greatest impact in Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
Virginia and Wyoming.
   Goldberg said employers in the following states, which allow
businesses to request people to take lie detector tests, could be
affected by the new law: California, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland,
Montana, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
   The remaining 14 states and the District of Columbia have laws
banning polygraph examinations for employment purposes, and these
laws take precedence over the new federal statute if they are more
restrictive, according to Goldberg.

<HEAD>Cuba Calls Plebiscite Petition `Inconceivable & Absurd'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro's government has
rejected as ``absurd and inconceivable'' a petition by 100 writers,
actors and scientists that he hold a plebiscite to see if the Cuban
people want him to stay in power.
   The petition had asked Castro to hold an yes-or-no referendum as
Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet did earlier this year. After forces
opposed to Pinochet won the plebiscite, Pinochet said he would step
down in 1990.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Rolando Perez del Amo rejected the
petition in a statement quoted in a dispatch from Havana by the
official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina.
   ``It is absurd and inconceivable to establish a comparision
between Cuba and the fascist regime of Augusto Pinochet'' in Chile,
the news service quoted Perez del Amo as saying.
   Perez del Amo referred to the letter during a press conference
held in Havana dealing with the 30th anniversary of the triumph of
the Cuban revolution on Jan. 1.
   ``The Cuban people held a grand plebiscite concerning their
destiny 30 years ago and they repeat that action every day with
their decision to continue with socialism,'' Prensa Latina,
monitored in Mexico City, quoted Perez del Amo as saying.
   Perez del Amo's declaration was the first official reaction of
Cuba's communist leadership to the letter, which appeared in Mexico
City newspapers on Tuesday.
   According to the newspapers, the letter was sent from Paris to
Havana and addressed to Castro. It exhorted Castro to hold the
plebiscite ``to let the people of Cuba express their agreement or
rejection of his continued leadership.''
   Among those who signed were Nobel Prize winners Jean Dausset and
Andre L. Wolff, in medicine, and Saul Bellow, in literature. They
also included Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini, French actors Yves
Montand and Gerard Depardieu and writers Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru,
Octavio Paz of Mexico, Eugene Ionesco of France and Susan Sontag of
the United States.
   ``Whether you triumph or not, Mr. President (Castro), you should
make a step toward democracy and in the shortest time possible call
elections so that the Cuban people can freely elect their leaders,''
reads the letter.
   Paz told the official Mexican government news service Notimex on
Tuesday that he and the others who signed the letter did not intend
to compare the Cuban and Chilean governments.
   ``It is a bit silly that the Cuban government says that the
country's plebiscite was held 30 years ago,'' Notimex quoted Paz as
saying. ``The people don't marry leaders for their entire
rulerships.''

<HEAD>Gas Tax Boost: Rx for Budget Deficit or `Road of No Return?'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. motorist pulls into a service station
and plunks down $1.05 for a gallon of gasoline. In Britain the same
amount of gas would cost the equivalent of $2.77.
   Why the difference?
   British motorists, and drivers in many other European countries,
pay taxes accounting for approximately half of the price of gasoline
at the pump, making it a luxury item for many.
   Some now believe the modest U.S. federal gas tax of 9 cents a
gallon could be headed in the same direction.
   ``We are about to follow the Europeans down the road of no
return,'' says Bill Berman, director of energy and environment for
the American Automobile Association.
   He also heads a newly formed umbrella group called Fuel Users for
Equitable Levies (FUEL), which last week launched a grass-roots
campaign to offset mounting pressure for a gas tax increase as a way
of reducing the nation's $155 billion budget deficit. The anti-tax
lobby is supported by such groups as the American Farm Bureau
Federation and the American Petroleum Institute.
   No gas tax increase is imminent, but with policymakers desperate
for some solution to the deficit, the debate is in full swing.
   Critics say a tax increase would mean slower business, higher
inflation and fewer jobs.
   Supporters retort that a higher tax would calm international
deficit jitters and thus strengthen the economy in the long run. As
an added benefit, they claim, it would reduce America's growing
dependence on foreign oil by curbing demand for gasoline.
   ``The effort must now be made to get the deficit down,'' former
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said in calling for an
increase in the tax.
   President-elect Bush is opposed to a higher gas tax, but the idea
has drawn support from witnesses before the 14-member National
Economic Commission created by Congress to search for deficit
remedies.
   Each penny-per-gallon of additional tax would yield $1 billion in
revenue. That makes it seem an attractively quick way to sharply
reduce the budget deficit.
   Business is divided. Within the auto industry, Chrysler Corp.
Chairman Lee Iacocca supports a tax increase, but General Motors
Corp. is stoutly opposed to it on grounds that it would hammer the
economy. Ford Motor Co. is hesitant on the issue but has said it
could support a phased increase of 5 cents per gallon per year.
   The roadbuilding lobby, led by the Associated General
Contractors, opposes a tax increase on grounds that the additional
revenue would go to cutting the budget deficit instead of expanding
the $14 billion Federal Highway Trust Fund. There is no assurance
that the additional tax collections would be used for trimming the
deficit, however, if the money were channeled into general revenues.
   In Congress, Southwesterners are cool to anything that would
reduce demand for gasoline at a time when energy-producing economies
back home are feeling the pain of depressed oil prices.
   ``I hope they are able to avoid any new tax, including a gasoline
tax,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said in a statement.
   As chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, Bentsen
would have much to say about the matter.
   Across Capitol Hill, at the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee, the picture is different. Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., has been smiling on the idea of a gas tax increase, although
his last attempt to push one through failed on the House floor.
   ``It was good economic policy and good energy policy,''
Rostenkowski told a Wall Street group recently. ``It was not good
politics.''
   Rostenkowski now says it's up to Bush to take the initiative on
the gas tax issue, but he adds that a tax boost would be on the
agenda if he had his druthers.
   Some critics of the idea say a gas tax increase would fall
unfairly on Westerners and farmers, some of whom must drive longer
distances to take care of essential needs.
   ``The billions of dollars (in new revenue) would not come from
the population as a whole but only from those men and women who have
no choice but to drive their cars to get to jobs, to stores to
purchase food and other essentials, to take children to schools and
to otherwide conduct their daily routines,'' says former Federal
Highway Administrator Ray A. Barnhart.
   Capitol Hill tax watchers caution that if lawmakers turn to a gas
tax increase it is unlikely to come as an unadorned, stand-alone
issue. Instead, they say, it is more likely to be part of a complex
compromise package with incentives to serve as sales points and
offset any charge of regional bias.

<HEAD>New Drug Approved To Help Arthritis Suffers Avoid Ulcers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government approved a new prescription drug
intended to help arthritis sufferers avoid getting potentially
life-threatening ulcers from their arthritis medicine.
   ``We think it is a very important drug,'' Arthritis Foundation
spokesman Peter Mathon said Tuesday shortly after the Food and Drug
Administration announced its approval.
   To be sold under the trade name Cytotec by G.D. Searle of Skokie,
Ill., the drug _ misoprostol _ is for use by patients at high risk
for developing complications of stomach ulcers while on arthritis
drugs.
   The FDA said that includes the elderly and patients of any age
with other serious illness.
   In those patients, the FDA said, the ulcers may go undetected
until they have caused bleeding or other serious consequences.
   ``The foundation's position is that, when properly used, it can
reduce mortality among people with arthritis,'' Mathon, the
Atlanta-based Arthritis Foundation's vice president for public
affairs, said in a telephone interview.
   He noted that the drug has potential benefit for all 37 million
Americans with arthritis, even those not now on anti-inflammatory
drugs.
   The FDA said there are an estimated 200,000 cases of
gastrointestinal bleeding each year due to the 68 million
prescriptions of non-sterodial, anti-inflammatory drugs _ called
NSAIDs _ used for arthritis. It estimated there are 10,000 to 20,000
deaths a year associated with such bleeding.
   Among the most commonly used NSAIDs are high-dose aspirin,
ibuprofen, piroxicam and naproxen.
   ``Until now, we have had no drug that could prevent NSAID-induced
ulcers,'' said FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young. ``Since these ulcers
are sometimes life-threatening, this drug should save lives as well
as costly hospitalizations.
   ``The drug should also permit elderly, debilitated or ulcer-prone
patients to continue arthritis therapies they might otherwise have
to interrupt,'' Young added in a statement announcing the approval.
   Misoprostol is a copy of a natural substance found in the human
body that regulates acid secretions of the stomach. It suppresses
gastric acid secretion and replaces natural substances called tissue
prostaglandins that have been depleted by NSAIDs.
   Anti-abortion activists had urged that the FDA not approve the
drug because it can cause changes in muscle tone, including muscles
of the uterus that can cause miscarriages.
   The FDA is requiring labeling to prescribing physicians and their
patients to state the drug is not for use ``in women of childbearing
potential unless the patient must receive non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs and is at high risk of complications from
gastric ulcers associated with use of the NSAID.''
   For these young women, the labeling requires physicians to obtain
a negative pregnancy test before prescribing misoprostol and to
ensure that the patient has been informed of the need to avoid
getting pregnant while taking the drug.
   The FDA approval also stipulated that the drug will be
distributed only in a consumer package that contains the cautionary
language.
   However, once a drug is approved by the FDA, the agency loses
control over how doctors actually prescribe it. As a practical
matter, however, doctors generally are reluctant to knowingly
prescribe a drug _ especially a new drug _ outside FDA guidelines
because they fear it could be raised against them in the event of a
malpractice claim.
   Acknowledging some controversy surrounding the drug, the
Arthritis Foundation's Mathon said, ``Any drug has to be used
carefully and responsibly administered by physicians to be sure
people are using and benefiting from it properly.''

<HEAD>Over 100,000 Refugees Expected in US Next Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The number of refugees arriving in the United
States is likely to top 100,000 in 1989 for the first time since
1982, according to the U.S. Committee on Refugees.
   The peak year for refugees was 1980, when 207,116 arrived in this
country.
   Court Robinson, a policy analyst for the refugee committee, said
he expects the total to exceed 100,000 next year, although U.S. law
will allow no more than 94,000 to get formal refugee status, which
entitles them to a wide range of services, including English lessons.
   Such services cost taxpayers about $2,000 for each refugee in the
first year after arrival and often additional thousands in following
years. A precise figure cannot be calculated, Robinson said in an
interview Tuesday.
   In addition, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said on Dec. 8 that
as many as 2,000 immigrants a month will be admitted from the Soviet
Union with ``parole'' status. This status allows them to get jobs,
but they must pay their own fares and get legal documents from
sponsors in the United States who promise not to let them become a
charge on the public. They also find it harder to become citizens,
Robinson said.
   His committee is a private group, financed by foundations and
other contributors.
   The U.S. government grants refugee status only to those it
considers to be in danger of prosecution in their homelands,
although some arrive in this country without official approval.
   Many more than the usual number of refugees are expected in 1989
from Soviet Armenia, in addition to increased numbers of Soviet
Jews, because of the devastating earthquake in Armenia last month
and continued racial strife in the region.
   The National Conference on Soviet Jewry reports that 2,234 Jews
left the Soviet Union in November, the highest figure in nine years.
It put the total at 15,640 for the first 11 months of 1988.
   Larger numbers of refugees have been coming from Indochina,
according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Its figures
show that between October 1987 and August of this year, 19,962 were
approved from Vietnam, 15,062 from Laos, and 3,916 from Cambodia.
   Refugees who reach this country without official approval can ask
for asylum. In the year that ended last Sept. 30, asylum was granted
in 5,531 cases. About half of those granted asylum _ 2,786 _ were
from Nicaragua.

   Taxpayers who unknowingly contributed a
substantial chunk to President Reagan's last inauguration may be off
the hook this time, at least for the cost of exclusive events they
couldn't attend.
   Under new direction from Congress, the Pentagon intends to seek
reimbursement for its services and supplies for private events at
President-elect Bush's inauguration. The private Presidential
Inaugural Committee intends to pay that tab.
   In 1985, seven federal agencies spent nearly $16 million on the
Reagan festivities _ with the Defense Department accounting for $10
million.
   Three weeks before the inaugural period begins, the committee has
yet to tell the Pentagon how many military men and women it will
need for its galas, celebrations and other activities.
   But Capt. Gail Hayes of the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee said
her committee does not anticipate a decline in the number of people
it will be asked to detail to inaugural duties.
   ``Our best estimate is that DOD participation will be 8,500
people,'' she said _ the same as in 1985.
   While the participation level could be equally high, the bill to
taxpayers should not.
   Tucked deep in the defense authorization act for fiscal 1989 is a
paragraph saying the defense secretary should seek reimbursement for
troops used at private inaugural events, and only volunteers should
be used at such events. It was sought by outgoing Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis., well-known for his efforts to curb what he
considers wasteful spending.
   Proxmire was moved by a General Accounting Office report last
year that detailed federal spending on the 1985 inauguration and
noted that soldiers had been used _ sometimes unwillingly _ as
chauffeurs, photographers and escorts.
   Ron Tammen, Proxmire's administrative assistant, said the new
policy is meant to relieve military people of chores such as driving
VIP spouses to beauty parlors and to restrict federal subsidies of
balls and other events he described as ``virtual political payoffs.''
   ``We specifically meant to prevent the use of the military at
balls and galas, which are exclusively to entertain the VIPS _
(Bush) supporters and Republicans,'' Tammen said.
   Despite some confusion about the provision at the Pentagon and
the inaugural committee, both say they will heed the guidelines.
   ``The Department of Defense does intend to seek reimbursement
where appropriate for support rendered,'' said Hayes, defining
``where appropriate'' as meaning private events.
   ``We'll make sure that we comply,'' said Stephen Studdert,
executive director of the Presidential Inaugural Committee.
   Studdert said it had not been determined which inaugural events
would be considered private as opposed to public. But general
counsel Jan Baran said an event is considered public if 50 percent
of the tickets are available to the public, and by that standard,
about one-third of two dozen activities are public.
   Among the open events are a parade, a pageant, a children's
festival, an ``American Tribute to Democracy'' and a thanksgiving
service at Washington Cathedral. There are more than a dozen private
events including nine balls, a worship service, a dinner, a gala, a
vice presidential reception, a salute to the first lady and a
celebration for young Americans.
   PIC and Pentagon officials were unclear about how much the
Pentagon can expect to be repaid or what impact the new policy will
have on the inaugural committee's $20 to $25 million budget.
   ``It's hard to measure,'' said Studdert. ``It may not add on to
the overall cost. We may save on other categories by increasing
volunteer use. That's our hope.''

<HEAD>Government Seeks More Comment On Program To Eradicate Sheep Disease</HEAD>

   The Agriculture Department still wants to scrap
its 26-year-old scrapie eradication program, but it is giving
opponents another two months to scrape together arguments on why it
shouldn't.
   The department said in a Federal Register notice on Tuesday that
it was extending for another 60 days, or until March 6, the period
for public comment on its proposal last month to dismantle the
scrapie program.
   The cooperative federal-state program was begun in 1952 in an
effort to contain and eventually eradicate scrapie, which is a
degenerative and fatal disease that attacks the central nervous
systems of sheep and goats.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of USDA's Animal and Plant Health
and Inspection Service, said researchers have yet to produce a cure
or even a diagnostic test for the disease.
   Also, the eradication effort calling for infected or exposed
animals to be destroyed is not required by the law, making the
program dependent on accurate reporting by flock owners.
   ``The intent and goals are laudable,'' Glosser said, ``but it is
questionable whether we have the technology or regulatory framework
to administer an eradication program at this time.''
   Although there is no evidence that scrapie poses a human health
hazard, it is nearly always fatal to infected animals. The disease
has an incubation period of 18 months to 42 months and can be
transmitted before the appearance of symptoms such as debilitation,
unsteady gait and rubbing or scratching to relieve intense itching.
   Since there is no diagnostic test for confirming the presence of
scrapie in live animals, final confirmation of it in dead ones
requires an examination of their brain tissue.
   Under the current voluntary program, animals reported as infected
or exposed are supposed to be destroyed and remaining animals in the
flock are to be held under surveillance for 42 months.

   Implementation of the U.S.-Canada free trade
agreement on Jan. 1 will have a modest effect initially on American
poultry producers but a more significant one later on, an American
producers group says.
   The Canadian House of Commons approved the accord on Saturday,
and the Senate is expected follow suit by the end of this week,
allowing the agreement to go into effect on schedule. The U.S.
Congress gave its approval earlier this year.
   Canada will keep its basic poultry quotas in place, but they will
be enlarged slightly to permit the possibility of increased exports
from the United States, the National Broiler Council said Tuesday.
   Currently, Canada allows the poultry imports equal to 6.3 percent
of its previous year's domestic chicken production. Under the new
trade agreement, that figure rises to not less than 7.5 percent.
   The increase of 1.2 percentage points represents no change in
reality, since that is the amount of additional chicken Canada has
been importing in recent years under supplemental quota provisions.
   But all poultry product tariffs will be reduced in equal
increments over the next 10 years under the accord, with binding
arbitration panels to resolve any anti-dumping or countervailing
duty cases that may arise.
   The trade liberalization also removes quotas on poultry products
that are combined with other food ingredients, such as frozen
chicken dinners. However, they may still be subject to import duties.

   It was only natural that at age 39,
twins Yvonne and Yvette McCarther would leave their mother, who
lovingly taught them to think of themselves as individuals.
   So the women, Siamese twins joined at the head, wonder why
anybody else would find their decision unusual.
   ``I'm 39, and I always said I was going to move into my own place
by the time I was 40,'' said Yvette. ``I mean, when you get to be in
your late 30s, you just decide _ it's time to get your own place.''
   Yvonne agreed.
   ``I only wish I'd gotten around to it before _ I love it, being
on my own,'' she said.
   Medical science calls the women craniopagus twins, the rarest
kind of Siamese birth. They have separate brains and personalities,
but share a bloodstream.
   Their mother, Willie McCarther of Compton, taught her daughters
to think of themselves as separate beings, and they've learned the
lesson well.
   Last year, they took classes at Compton Community College,
creating a stir they greeted more with bemusement than anything else.
   Their new home is a tiny apartment in suburban North Long Beach
with one bedroom that rents for $510 a month, paid for with close
budgeting of government checks.
   One the top of their television set is an autographed photo of
Ronnie and Donnie Galyon, 37, the only other known pair of living
adult Siamese twins joined together.
   The Galyons tour with a circus, as the McArthurs did in early
years in order to pay hospital bills. Their mother ruled out surgery
to separate them, fearing one would die.
   Yvette said it took her weeks to find her new apartment.
   ``I saw one in Compton I liked, but it was so expensive, I told
the guy it would have to wait till I got married,'' she giggled.
   ``Better see if he's got a brother,'' deadpanned Yvonne.

<HEAD>Consultant, Contractors Accused Of Paying Off Pentagon Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Air Force official has been accused by
federal investigators of receiving ``payments and other gratuities''
in exchange for helping a defense consultant and contractors,
according to a report published today.
   Victor D. Cohen, deputy assistant Air Force secretary in charge
of buying tactical command, control, communications and computer
systems, ``used his official position'' to help consultant William
Galvin and his clients, including Unisys Corp., Loral Electronic
Systems Division and Cubic Corp., The Washington Post reported.
   ``Cohen's participation has ranged from providing Galvin's
clients with proprietary information to structuring procurements in
a manner that eliminates competition,'' said an affidavit unsealed
Tuesday. The document was filed in court last June and was released
by a federal magistrate in Hyattsville, Md., in response to a
lawsuit by the Post.
   ``Cohen's assistance to Galvin's clients can clearly be traced to
illegal payments and gratuities provided to him by Galvin or the
clients,'' said the affidavit, which was filed to support a search
of Cohen's house in Potomac, Md. The affidavit apparently gave no
total, but mentions that an earlier investigation of Cohen revealed
a $2,500 check from Galvin to Cohen in January 1982.
   Cohen's attorney, Seymour Glanzer, did not answer a telephone
call to his home late Tuesday night. The Post said Galvin's attorney
also was not available for comment.
   Prosecutors have said they have evidence that consultants _
including some former high-level Reagan administration officials and
former high-ranking military men who work for the nation's largest
defense contractors _ bribed Pentagon officials for information
vital to winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   There have been no indictments in the case, which was revealed in
June when FBI agents raided more than 40 locations. Those locations
included Cohen's home and office, as well as the offices of Galvin
and his stepson, Kenneth F. Brooke. Cohen, whose phone was tapped,
has been relieved of contracting responsibilities, as have four
other Pentagon employees who have been subjects of the more than
two-year investigation.
   The Cohen affidavit indicates that Cubic President Colvin
Wellborn had complained to Galvin that Cohen had ``stalled for six
months'' on providing an acquisition plan.
   ``Cohen's willingness to assist Cubic in obtaining government
contracts can be traced to what is believed to be the receipt of a
payment from Cubic,'' the affidavit said.
   Two other affidavits also were released Tuesday in Hyattsville.
   One alleged that ``investigation of Unisys activities
demonstrates that (former Unisys vice president and later company
consultant Charles) Gardner and others have sought to corruptly
influence congressional legislation on defense programs through
payment of monies and gratuities to selected congressmen.''
   That affidavit concerned the search of the home of Richard
Seelmeyer, a former aide to the late Rep. Joseph A. Addabbo, D-N.Y.
Seelmeyer, of Berwyn Heights, Md., operated an airplane Unisys used
to provide flights for members of Congress.
   Charles F.C. Ruff, a Unisys lawyer, told the Post he had
``absolutely no knowledge of or any comment about any attempt to
corruptly influence or the payment of gratuities to any
congressmen.''
   The affidavit refers to wire-tapped conversations in which
``Gardner has made references on several occasions that if Seelmeyer
was to talk, he could do a lot of damage, in particular in reference
to Congressman (Roy) Dyson's trip to New York in May 1988, in which
Seelmeyer apparently had a role in planning.''
   ``I didn't have any role in making that trip,'' Seelmeyer told
the Post. ``I knew they were going up there but that was it.''
   Dyson, D-Md., has denied that there was any impropriety in his
trip to New York, during which he visited a Unisys facility.
   Dyson and several other congressmen were mentioned early in the
case, prompting a visit to Capitol Hill by U.S. Attorney Henry E.
Hudson, who is running the investigation.
   Members of Congress who attended the closed meeting said later
that no congressman was a target of the investigation. But Hudson
said in October that he ``never made such a statement.'' He said he
only told them that ``no member of Congress had been the subject of
electronic surveillance, had received a subpoena to testify in front
of the grand jury at that time or had been the subject of a search
warrant.''
   The third affidavit unsealed Tuesday, the Post said, supported
the search of the Rockville, Md., home and office of consultant Bill
Sanda, who allegedly worked with consultant William Parkin to
provide inside information to Unisys and other defense contractors.
Parkin also has been the subject of searches.
   A source said in November that Parkin would be among the first
people charged in the Pentagon bribery case ``unless he comes in and
cuts a deal, which he is not going to do.''
   Parkin has told reporters that he believes he broke no laws in
running his Alexandria, Va., consulting business.

   In poignant letters from prison, one of China's
most famous dissidents sent his wife kisses and advised his sickly
daughter to get more sun and exercise.
   ``Did you have a happy birthday?'' Xu Wenli wrote his daughter in
one of five letters obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday.
   In another, he wrote gleefully: ``I had a great weekend because I
got six letters.''
   Xu's letters, dated since April and sent to his family in Beijing
from Beijing's No. 1 Prison, are his only contact with the outside
since he was barred from having visitors in 1985, four years into a
15-year sentence for counterrevolutionary activity.
   Xu, 43, has spent much of the time in solitary confinement.
   The former electrician was among the leaders of China's 1978-79
Democracy Wall Movement, during which Deng Xiaoping, newly in power,
tolerated unprecedented open calls for multiparty democracy and
other reforms.
   But in early 1979, his position in the ruling Communist Party
consolidated, Deng ordered a crackdown on the dozens of unofficial
journals that had sprung up, and he ended the Democracy Wall itself,
a brick wall in Beijing where outspoken posters went up daily.
   Xu mimeographed the underground magazine April Fifth Forum in his
home, in which he argued that a multiparty system was not
anti-Marxist and would help the socialist cause. He was arrested in
1981 and convicted the following year.
   His letters, addressed to his wife Qang Tong and 16-year-old
daughter, Xu Jingjing, said nothing about his own condition.
Instead, he sent a steady stream of questions and advice.
   To the daughter, who has been ill for several years with a bad
back, he wrote on Oct. 28: ``You should improve your daily
nutrition, exercise daily and make a study plan. After you make your
plans tell me or I will worry.
   ``Did you have a happy birthday? No matter how tired, how busy
you are, try to squeeze time to sing, listen to music, play
badminton, and then you will be happier and the back pain will be
less. ... When you're recovered you'll be jumping around like a
rabbit.''
   To his wife, a teacher, he wrote, ``Your school is too far away.
Try not to bicycle if possible. ... When you go home after school,
is there anyone to accompany you?''
   He closed, ``I'm kissing you, my dear.''
   In the most recent letter, dated Dec. 2, Xu wrote, ``Regarding
your letter of Nov. 12, never mind the contents. The mere fact that
it's already four pages causes tears of happiness to cover my face.''
   He also wrote of his pride in his wife and daughter, adding,
``Because of you, and for you, I can be at peace and accept what
fate sends.''
   Xu also expressed concern for his family in a ``self-defense''
smuggled from prison in 1985. Publication of the essay in Western
periodicals caused authorities to cancel his visitor privileges.
   Ren Wanding, a fellow participant in the Democracy Wall movement
who was jailed for four years, said Xu was allowed to send a
two-page letter about once every two months.
   Ren, who was released in 1983, remained silent until November,
when he gave foreign reporters a long essay on the Democracy Wall
Movement, also called the ``Beijing Spring.''
   In a new essay released Tuesday, Ren declared the 12 months
beginning in November ``Beijing Spring Memorial Year'' and said his
goal was to draw international attention to the plight of his jailed
friends.
   More than a dozen leaders of the movement remain jailed. The most
famous is Wei Jingsheng, who pleaded for democracy as a ``fifth
modernization'' to go along with the government's program of
improving agriculture, industry, science and the military.
   Although the Communist Party has encouraged greater openness on
selected topics, including disclosure of official corruption, calls
for any change in the party's ruling role remain forbidden.
   Sporadic calls by students for democracy have been suppressed,
including a series of massive nationwide demonstrations in the
winter of 1986-87.
   In his latest essay, Ren appealed to President-elect George Bush,
who served as U.S. liaison officer to China in 1974-75.
   ``If you are really concerned about Chinese affairs, then I ask
you to first of all be concerned about the Dzmoracy Wall personages
who benefited China's social development and opening up. They have
been discriminated against and watched by your friendly Chinese
government,'' Ren wrote.
   Aside from Ren, China's only dissident willing to be quoted as
demanding multiparty democracy is internationally known
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who believes his fame has shielded him.
   Ren, a little-known accountant, said he was not so confident but
that he hoped publicity would be a shield.
   ``I don't want China to copy Western systems or Western
democracy,'' he said in an interview. ``China can work out its own
democracy. China's economic liberalization inevitably must lead to
greater political freedom.''

<TEXT>
   Some restaurateurs have to struggle to stay
afloat. George ``Butch'' Corne would just like to refloat his
restaurant, which sank to the bottom of the Ohio River.
   Corne said his floating restaurant, Fischerman's Wharf, sank
during the weekend after it apparently was struck by a boat.
   ``There's nothing we can do until the water goes down and we can
check it for holes,'' said Vickie Jenkins, manager of Fischerman's
Wharf. ``This is under water, like as in all the things inside are
floating around.''
   The water was expected to crest today, Corne said. ``At this
point, we think we've been hit. It sank too fast.''
   He suspects a sizable hole in the 135-by-35 foot barge because
pumps on it would have been able to contain a small leak.
   Corne also will take a personal bath on the mess. He said he is
self-insured and estimated the damage at $300,000.
   Fischerman's Wharf sat on a wooden barge along the Ohio, about 10
miles east of Evansville. It took the unusual spelling of its name
from the barge's previous owner, Randall Fischer. An attached steel
barge contains Crawdaddy's bar and grill, designed for pleasure
boaters.
   ``It's sticking 6 inches out of the water,'' Corne said of
Crawdaddy's.
   The wooden barge sank once before. Then, it was turned into a
restaurant in the fall of 1987 and closed just one month later when
Corne discovered his insurance company was not covering the
restaurant. After Corne got liability insurance, the barge reopened
in May 1988 with the addition of the bar and grill.
   If the barge can be salvaged, Corne said he would reopen the
steak and seafood restaurant.
   Although he's disappointed, Corne said he's trying to keep his
head above water. ``It's just one of those things,'' he said. ``I'm
not going to let that get me down.''

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old who said he was sleepwalking
when he shot his mother to death was placed on probation for five
years and ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment.
   Gary Michael Willis of Winnsboro pleaded guilty in June to
manslaughter for killing his mother, Pamela Willis. During pretrial
hearings, a psychiatrist said Willis was sleepwalking when he killed
his mother and wounded his father in 1986.
   State District Judge Lewis O. Lauve on Tuesday told Willis there
was a reasonable doubt whether he was culpable for the crime. The
youth originally was charged with second-degree murder.
   Lauve placed Willis on supervised probation, but said if he
violated the probation, he could go to prison for 21 years.
   The judge said Willis must refrain from any criminal activity,
including drug use, undergo psychiatric therapy, perform 100 hours
of community service work annually for five years and be gainfully
employed or a full-time student.

   Federal regulators worked into the night Tuesday on
what is expected to be a $300 million bailout of five ailing savings
and loan associations.
   Dallas banker Gerald J. Ford and Revlon Corp. owner Ronald
Perelman were expected to buy the five thrifts, the Dallas Times
Herald on Wednesday quoted anonymous sources as saying.
   The New York Times also Wednesday reported federal regulators
were expected to contribute $5 billion to the transaction over a
10-year period.
   The savings and loans involved have combined assets of $12.2
billion.
   The transaction is one of several in a last-minute spree of deals
scheduled this week under the Southwest Plan, which was devised by
federal thrift regulators as a way to deal with the current Texas
savings-and-loan crisis.
   Seventy insolvent Texas thrifts have been merged into 12 packaged
under the Southwest Plan to date.
   Regulators and purchasers are racing to finish their business by
midnight Saturday, when tax benefits that lower the costs of the
purchases expire.
   Regulators told the Times Herald the thrifts would open
Wednesday, even if an agreement with purchasers was not reached
overnight.
   The five thrifts are First Texas Savings Association and Montfort
Savings Association, both in Dallas; Gibraltar Savings Association
and Home Savings Association, both in Houston; and Killeen Savings
and Loan Association, in Killeen.

   Alfred Melville Pride, a retired four-star
admiral and a former commander of the 7th Fleet in the Pacific, is
dead of a cardiac arrest.
   Pride, who was also a former chief of the Navy's Bureau of
Aeronautics and a former commander of naval air forces in the
Pacific, died at his sister's home on Saturday. He was 91.
   During World War II he was commanding officer of the light
aircraft carrier Belleau Wood, and in that capacity directed air
strikes against Japanese positions in the Gilbert, Marshall,
Caroline and Mariana islands in 1943 and 1944. He also participated
in planning the invasion of Okinawa.
   He was a member of the original crew of the Navy's first aircraft
carrier, the Langley, a converted collier, and in October 1922 was
one of a small group of test pilots who made experimental landings
and takeoffs on the ship's flight deck. While a junior officer
aboard the Langley, Price developed arresting gear to bring landing
aircraft to a halt once they had touched down on the deck.
   Later he served in the original crews of the Navy's next two
carriers, the Saratoga and the Lexington.
   A native of Somerville, Mass., Pride was named commander of naval
air forces for the Pacific Fleet in February 1956, and served there
until 1959, when he retired from active duty.
   Pride was a native of Somerville, Mass., and a resident of
Arlington, Va. He had lived in the Washington, D.C., area since his
retirement.

   World War I hero Alvin York has a statue on
the grounds of the Tennessee state Capitol. His life, like that of
World War II hero Audie Murphy, was made into a Hollywood movie.
   Joe Hooper has nothing.
   The most decorated U.S. soldier of the Vietnam War lies nearly
forgotten near the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National
Cemetery, another symbol of a war the nation would just as soon
forget.
   In Washington state, where Hooper grew up and lived much of his
life, there is no individual monument to his memory and the deeds
that won him 37 citations, including the Medal of Honor.
   Plans to rename various public buildings or parks after Hooper
have been in the works for years. It isn't that anyone is opposed to
them, but more often they seem to stall for lack of interest.
   That may soon change.
   Rep. Rod Chandler, R-Wash., plans to introduce a bill in January
to rename the substance-abuse wing of the Veterans Administration
hospital in Seattle after the man who won the nation's highest
military honor, plus two Silver Stars and 11 Purple Hearts.
   The office of Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., is leading a separate
drive to get the VA to do the same thing, without Congress having to
pass a bill.
   And some efforts have started in Moses Lake, where Hooper grew
up, to rename a city park or erect a memorial to him.
   Why has it taken so long?
   ``The unpopularity of the war has shifted over to a bias against
the individuals who served in the war,'' speculated Jim Gunsolus,
the Adams aide working on the Hooper effort.
   Part of the reason may have been Hooper himself, who drank his
way out of the military and a variety of jobs after the war, failed
to play the part of war hero for the government, and died from a
fall in a motel room in Kentucky in 1979 at age 40.
   Donald Ross, a Medal of Honor historian in Port Orchard who knew
Hooper well, said a small number of recipients are ``unable to live
and honor the Medal of Honor.''
   ``He was one of them,'' said Ross, who served at Pearl Harbor and
is a Medal of Honor winner himself. ``It was too much of a load for
him.''
   Another friend said Hooper couldn't bear what he witnessed as an
employee of the VA hospital in Seattle.
   ``It just got too much for him and he couldn't stand all the
misery around here,'' said Joe Feldman of the American Legion in
Seattle.
   Hooper's peacetime life was in sharp contrast to his 30 months in
Vietnam.
   The Medal of Honor citation, covering six hours of combat near
Hue on Feb. 21, 1968, relates astonishing exploits _ killing two
dozen enemy, rescuing six of his men and suffering seven wounds.
   Hooper, then a 29-year-old sergeant, crossed a river through
enemy fire and with his men overran several bunkers. He then ran
into heavy gunfire to help his wounded men, suffering serious wounds
but refusing medical treatment.
   Then, he singlehandedly stormed three enemy bunkers, destroying
them with hand grenades and rifle fire, and also killing two enemy
soldiers who had attacked his unit's chaplain.
   Leading his men forward, Hooper destroyed three buildings housing
enemy riflemen, and killed a North Vietnamese officer with his
bayonet.
   His initial wounds now compounded by grenade fragments, Hooper
raced down a small trench, hurling hand grenades to destroy four
enemy bunkers.
   He then ran across an open field, still under enemy fire, to
rescue a wounded man. Upon reaching that man, Hooper was attacked by
an enemy soldier and killed him with a pistol.
   He then killed three North Vietnamese officers with rifle fire,
reorganized his men, and did not consent to evacuation until the
following morning.
   What the citation doesn't say is that 189 U.S. soldiers began the
river crossing and Hooper was among just 14 who survived.
   Hospitalized for his wounds, he broke out of the hospital to
return to his unit. In the next two days, Hooper and 10 other
soldiers ambushed 600 enemy fighters, earning him a Silver Star and
another bullet wound.
   Hooper was discharged shortly after, but found civilian life
boring and re-enlisted a few months later.
   The Army, which had been unable to locate him after the
discharge, awarded Hooper the Medal of Honor and he became a
celebrity.
   He served in Los Angeles as a recruiter, and in the Panama Canal
Zone as a courier. But things went badly, and he opted to rejoin the
101st Airborne in Vietnam.
   He won a second Silver Star and more medals, received a
battlefield commission to lieutenant, and ultimately returned to the
United States to work at a basic training company.
   But he didn't like being an officer and eventually resigned,
ending 18 years of service that began in 1956 when he enlisted in
the Navy.
   He returned to the Yakima area, where friends said he was often
drinking and carrying a pistol. He also was arthritic and suffered
60 percent disability because of his wounds.
   Friends tried to help Hooper with jobs and support, but he often
failed to show up for work before his fatal fall in a Louisville
motel room on May 6, 1979, Ross said.
   ``I know it was alcohol-related,'' Ross said.
   Hooper, who left behind a wife and a daughter, was buried at
Arlington with full military honors. His name was put on a plaque
honoring all Washington Medal of Honor winners at the state capital
in Olympia.
   Other than that, he was mostly forgotten.
   Both York and Murphy, the most decorated U.S. serviceman of World
War II, have VA hospitals named after them.
   ``People look at Audie Murphy and people like that and these guys
are national heroes,'' said Steve Witter, a Chandler spokesman.
``It's appropriate that (Hooper) be recognized for what he did.''

   GM's now-dead X-body cars were trumpeted in the
1980 model year as the first of a new breed of fuel-efficient models
from Detroit, but a consumers' guide says the cars prompted owners
to complain like no other American car built in the 1980s.
   Jack Gillis, the principal author of the 1989 edition of ``The
Car Book,'' which was released Tuesday, said the X-cars were
``probably the worst cars ever produced in the United States.''
   Gillis' guide, first produced in 1981 for the government but now
being issued as a private venture, for the first time this year
classifies cars according to owners' complaints lodged with the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
   Those government figures show 15 cars with no complaints at all:
nine Japanese names, four U.S. models, a Swede and a German.
   The book classifies autos as simply ``good,'' ``average'' or
``poor,'' according to whether a car ranked in the top, middle or
bottom third of the list of complaints per million cars. Similar
classifications are made in a companion volume, the ``Used Car
Book.''
   In a news release accompanying ``The Car Book,'' Gillis listed
actual complaint rates for the 26 best and 26 worst models.
   The X-cars occupied four of the worst seven slots.
   Before production ended after the 1985 model year, the X-cars _
Chevrolet Citation, Pontiac Phoenix, Oldsmobile Omega and Buick
Skylark _ were the subject of a massive 1983 lawsuit by the
government seeking a $4 million fine from General Motors Corp. and a
recall of 1980 X-car models to modify rear brakes that federal
regulators said could lock and cause a spin.
   GM, which already had recalled the cars twice to fix the brakes,
won the lawsuit in 1987, with the judge ruling there was ``no
engineering evidence of any peculiar property of the X-car generally
that renders them in any way exceptional.''
   Asked whether publicity over the lawsuit might not have prompted
complaints about the X-cars that otherwise would not have been
lodged, Gillis said: ``I think it all washes out. Look at the Suzuki
Samurai.''
   Consumers Union has criticized the Samurai utility vehicle for
what the organization said was a tendency to roll over in hard
turns. The criticism attracted wide publicity earlier this year. Yet
the Samurai was third from the bottom in complaints, with a
complaint rate of only 8 per million.
   In Detroit, GM spokesman Chuck Licari said company officials in a
position to comment on the X-car complaint rate were not in their
offices because of the holidays.
   According to Gillis, here are the 26 worst cars, complaint rates
per million cars and the applicable model years: the Pontiac Phoenix
1980-1984, 4,267; Peugeot 505 1980-1988, 4,017; Oldsmobile Omega
1980-1984, 3,523; Buick Skylark 1979-1985, 3,305; AMC

Chevrolet Citation 2,246; Dodge 400 1982-1983, 2,183; Dodge Omni
1978-1988, 2,153; Ford EXP 1981-1985, 2,109; Chrysler E Class
1983-1984, 1,930; Chrysler Laser 1984-1986, 1,903; Chrysler Cordoba
1980-1983, 1,727; Buick Century 1982-1988, 1,700; and Audi 5000
1978-1988, 1,693.
   Also, Lincoln Mark series 1983-1988, 1,671; Pontiac 1000
1981-1987, 1,670; Cadillac Cimarron 1981-1988, 1,648; Dodge Aries
1981-1988, 1,623; Plymouth Reliant 1981-1988, 1,573; Mercury Marquis
1983-1986, 1,539; Buick Skyhawk 1982-1988, 1,534; Pontiac Fiero
1984-1988, 1,517; Ford Thunderbird 1980-1982, 1,469; Chrysler
LeBaron 1982-1988, 1,440; Pontiac 6000 1982-1988, 1,438.
   There were 15 cars and light trucks with no complaints against
them at all: Acura Integra 1986-1988, Buick Somerset Regal
1985-1987, Chevrolet S-10 Blazer 1986-1988, Chrysler LeBaron GTS
1985-1988, Dodge Shadow 1987-1988, Honda Civic CRX 1984-1987,
Hyundai Excel 1986-1988, Mazda B2000 1986-1988, Nissan Van
1987-1988, Saab 9000 1986-1988, Subaru Justy 1987-1988, Toyota
Starlet 1981-1984, Toyota Tercel 1987-1988, Toyota Van Wagon
1986-1988 and the Volkswagen Fox 1987-1988.
   The next best 11 models and complaints per million: Nissan Sentra
1987-1988, 4; Suzuki Samurai 1986-1988, 8; Nissan Stanza 1987-1988,
15; Mazda 323 1986-1988, 23; Acura Legend 1986-1988, 25; Toyota MR2
1985-1988, 26; Mazda RX7 1986-1988, 32; Toyota Celica 1986-1988, 32;
Nissan Pickup 1986-1988, 62; Volkswagen Vanagon 1981-1988, 93;
Mitsubishi Tredia 1983-1988, 98.
   Gillis used information from a variety of sources, including
NHTSA's results of crash testing, fuel economy data compiled by the
Environmental Protection Agency, manufacturers' warranty data and
maintenance requirements, resale values tracked by the National
Automobile Dealers Association and material from other sources.
   Using ratings in fuel economy, warranties, repair and insurance
costs, complaints and crash tests _ which were given the greatest
weight _ Gillis rated ``best'' and ``worst'' choices from each major
size category. This year, the differences among large cars did not
warrant choosing best and worst in that size class.
   His top three choices: Subcompact _ Ford Escort, Honda Civic,

   A gas leak in an apartment complex killed one
man and critically injured two others Tuesday night, and more than
20 other residents were evacuated, authorities said.
   Firefighters were called to the three-story Kingston Apartments
complex west of downtown at 8:50 p.m. and found the unidentified man
dead at the scene, said Fire Department spokesman Jim Williamson.
   Two other men were taken to Hospital of the Good Samaritan where
they were in critical condition with respiratory problems caused by
gas inhalation, said nursing supervisor Kathleen Mitchell.
   The type of gas and the source of the leak were not known, said
Williamson. The natural gas line to the complex was shut off as a
precaution, he said.
   The Red Cross was contacted to provide temporary shelter for the
residents who were evacuated, Williamson said.

   Oscar-winner Hal Ashby, who directed the
1970s classics ``Coming Home,'' ``Being There'' and ``Harold and
Maude,'' was remembered upon his death as ``a genius for finding the
humor and beauty in the most unlikely places.''
   Ashby died of liver cancer at age 59 at his home Tuesday as he
was preparing to direct a film of Truman Capote's ``Hand Carved
Coffins,'' said his business manager, Larry Reynolds.
   Colleagues praised Ashby as a director who created visually
striking images, gave his star actors and fanciful stories the
stage, while he graciously disappeared into the shadows.
   Along with ``Coming Home,'' the anti-war Vietnam story starring
Jane Fonda and Jon Voight, Ashby turned out a string of highly
individualistic and idiosyncratic hits during the 1970s. They
included ``Shampoo,'' ``The Last Detail,'' ``Harold and Maude,''
``Being There'' and ``Bound for Glory.''
   From Jack Nicholson's foul-mouthed sailor in ``The Last Detail''
to Warren Beatty's oversexed hair stylist in ``Shampoo,'' Ashby
encouraged critically acclaimed performances.
   At his best, he seemed to understand instinctively themes that
touched audiences.
   His 1972 ``Harold and Maude'' became a cult classic that captured
the anxiety of becoming an adult while ``Coming Home,'' a multiple
Academy Award-winner in 1978, gripped a nation ready to re-examine
Vietnam.
   ``Coming Home,'' a story of a paraplegic's return from Vietnam,
won Oscars for Fonda and Voight. Bruce Dern, playing a traumatized
Marine officer, was nominated for best supporting actor, as was
Ashby for best director.
   Even with serious issues, Ashby found laughter.
   ``Hal had a genius for finding the humor and beauty in the most
unlikely places,'' said Bud Cort, who starred in ``Harold and
Maude,'' the black satire about a suicidal young man who falls for a
geriatric swinger played by the late Ruth Gordon.
   ``He created an atmosphere of trust and affection that was
unparalleled for me,'' Cort said. ``I feel blessed to have known
Hal. He had a lot of love to give, and we're all the richer for it.''
   In the mid-1970s, Ashby was one of Hollywood's more consistent
artists, directing Peter Sellers as a slightly retarded gardener
elevated to the role of presidential adviser in ``Being There,'' and
David Carradine as folk singer Woody Guthrie in ``Bound for Glory.''
   Toward the end of his career, Ashby's fortunes waned as he turned
out such undistinguished features as ``The Slugger's Wife,''
``Lookin' to Get Out'' and ``Eight Million Ways to Die.'' Early in
the 1980s, he shrugged off rumors that he and his career were dying.
   ``I can't recall the last thing I heard about myself that was
true,'' he said in a 1982 interview.
   Ashby described himself as an optimist. ``I basically have a very
positive philosophy on life, because I don't feel I have anything to
lose. Most things are going to turn out OK.''
   ``He was a gentle human being and his genteel humor will be
missed,'' said actor Randy Quaid, who starred as a slow-witted Navy
prisoner on the way to the brig in ``The Last Detail.'' Quaid also
was featured in ``Bound for Glory.''
   ``He inspired me as a man and as a director.''
   Ashby was also a gifted editor, winning a 1967 Academy Award for
his work on the Southernracial drama ``In The Heat of the Night,''
directed by Norman Jewison and starring Sidney Poitier and Rod
Steiger.
   His editing collaboration with Jewison also was seen in ``The
Cincinnati Kid,'' and ``The Russians are Coming, the Russians are
Coming.''
   Ashby, who was born in 1929 in Ogden, Utah, hitchhiked to
Southern California in 1950. He soon became an apprentice editor at
the Republic and Disney studios. He later became an assistant to
editor Robert Swink, collaborating on the editing of ``The Big
Country,'' ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' and ``The Greatest Story Ever
Told.''
   He directed his first film, ``The Landlord,'' with Beau Bridges
and Pearl Bailey in 1970.
   Ashby is survived by a sister, Ardith Thompson, and a brother,
Jack. A memorial service by the Directors Guild of America was
planned for Friday.

<TEXT>
   ``Twins,'' the comedy starring Danny DeVito and
Arnold Schwarzenegger as brothers separated at birth, took first
place in national box office receipts for the third consecutive
weekend.
   ``Twins'' pulled in $9 million during the long Christmas weekend,
followed by ``Rain Man,'' a somber study of autism starring Dustin
Hoffman and Tom Cruise, which grossed $8.7 million.
   In third place was the comedy ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of
Police Squad!'' featuring Leslie Nielsen as a bumbling police
detective, which collected $5.8 million. Next was ``Working Girl,''
the corporate Cinderella comedy with Melanie Griffith and Harrison
Ford, with ticket sales of $4.7 million in a limited release.
   ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' the Steve Martin-Michael Caine
remake of 1964's con-man comedy ``Bedtime Story,'' finished fifth
with $4.5 million. ``Scrooged,'' comedian Bill Murray's
interpretation of Dickens' Christmas classic, finished in sixth with
$4.2 million. Next was ``Oliver and Co.,'' an animated update of the
Oliver Twist story, which drew $3.5 million.
   ``Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' a horror movie from writer Clive
Barker, netted $3.19 million for eighth place. ``Tequila Sunrise,''
a moody drug-dealing drama with Mel Gibson, Kurt Russell and
Michelle Pfeiffer, collected $3.16 million for ninth. And ``The Land
Before Time,'' an animated tale of a baby dinosaur's perilous
journey through a prehistoric world, grossed $2 million and finished
10th.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.

   Inventor Larry Johnston has found out
the hard way that breaking into the board game ``game'' is no snap.
But he hopes his latest effort, the Blue Light Special, will land
him on Boardwalk.
   Or thereabouts.
   By modeling his new game on K mart's famous shopping incentive,
Johnston got the chain of discount stores to distribute it
nationwide. Major toy manufacturers such as Parker Bros. and Milton
Bradley rarely accept unsolicited proposals.
   The Blue Light Special is a standard board game in which the
player tosses a die, selects a card and moves the blue light icon
around the board.
   ``Everybody knows what a K mart blue light is,'' Johnston said.
``You mention a blue light special and people will tell you stories
about getting run over by shopping carts.''
   K mart announces 15- and 20-minute specials over loudspeakers and
uses police-style lights mounted on carts to pinpoint sale
merchandise.
   K mart spokeswoman Teri Kula says the chain is selling the game
in 800 of its 2,200 stores. Although no sales figures were
available, she said response was ``pretty good.'' Johnston estimates
he's sold the chain 10,000 copies of the game.
   Johnston promoted his first game, The Big Chicken Game, by
wearing a chicken suit outside the landmark Big Chicken restaurant
in Marietta that inspired it.
   He and his wife, Evelyn, have borrowed from banks, friends and
relatives to cover the tens of thousands of dollars they have
invested in their games since moving to Georgia from California in
1983.
   ``I guess I'm still a kid at heart,'' he said.

   A fractured collarbone turned into a lucky
break for Tim Moore.
   His bicycle accident inspired an invention that could keep riders
on the seat when they pedal over ``bicycle-grabbing'' sewer grates.
   Moore learned the lesson in April 1987 when he took the new
bicycle he had purchased for his 15-year-old son and ``came
face-to-face with a bike-grabber.''
   ``I had my arm in a sling and my face was all chewed up,'' Moore
recalled recently.
   He immediately began devising a way to eliminate the danger and,
with the help of a tool-and-die maker, came up with a high-density
polyethylene grid that is bolted onto iron grates, making it
impossible for a bicycle wheel to lodge between the grates.
   ``I talked to several cities to see what the options were. I
found it was very expensive for cities to replace old cast-iron
grates. Some cities had tried welding strips of metal across but
there was nothing out there that was cost-effective and easy to
install,'' he said.
   The grid is resistant to road salts and chemicals, tough enough
to withstand high temperatures and won't chip when scraped with a
snow plow, Moore said.
   ``We've discovered there's a huge market for it,'' he said.
``Cast-ron grates cost about $85 each to replace and we sell our
grate covers for about $25. We're the only ones out there with an
economical way of fitting just about any size grate.''
   The city of Rock Island gave Moore a big boost when it agreed to
invest in the grate cover, which he has patented.
   ``We bought a couple thousand about 18 months ago and they work
fine,'' said Bob Hawes, director of public works. ``We have about
4,000 sewer grates in the city and every year we had several claims
and lawsuits from people who got hurt riding their bicycles across
them.''
   The only snag in development, Moore said, came when he needed to
test his invention. He just couldn't force himself to ride across a
sewer grate again, with the memory of his last trip still fresh in
mind.
   ``I had `post-grate syndrome' and just couldn't bring myself to
do it,'' he said, laughing. ``I had my son ride across it instead.''

<HEAD>Group Claims It Has Been Frozen Out Of Plans For Stalin Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A grass-roots group seeking to build a center
devoted to the memory of the millions of victims of Stalinist crimes
is angrily accusing Communist authorities of trying to co-opt their
movement and limit its scope.
   On Tuesday, leading cultural and academic figures working with
the group condemned the Culture Ministry for announcing a design
competition for a monument to victims of state repression under
Josef Stalin.
   They protested that the group, called Memorial, had not been
consulted and charged that authorities were trying to limit the
impact of efforts to raise consciousness about Stalinism by
restricting the competition to Moscow.
   ``I think this is an effort, after so many victims, to shake off
the historical memory with the help of one or another stone or
bronze monument,'' railed poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
   Writer Yuri Karyakin said he saw an ``extraordinarily dangerous
symptom'' of continued government monopoly over social activity
despite the reform movement of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Yevtushenko, Karyakin, historian Yuri Afanasyev, editor Vitaly
Korotich of Ogonyok magazine and other figures at the forefront of
Gorbachev's reform effort spoke at a news conference sponsored by
Memorial.
   Founders of the group, lesser-known activists, began collecting
signatures late last year demanding a memorial center to victims of
Stalin's repression. They were repeatedly arrested and fined until
they gained official support earlier this year. Now, Memorial claims
more than 100 chapters in other cities.
   In July, Gorbachev spoke out in favor of memorial center, which
is of vital interest in a society still coming to grips with the
millions of deaths during Stalin's 1924-1953 rule. Thousands of
Soviets have relatives who were killed or sent to labor camps during
the period.
   In late November, Memorial sponsored an unofficial ``Week of
Conscience'' in which proposals for a memorial complex were
displayed.
   But the Ministry of Culture, in an announcement published in
Tuesday's issue of the newspaper Soviet Culture, revealed plans for
a competition to design a monument that excluded Memorial.
   The list of sponsors included only officially recognized
organizations such as artistic unions, the Moscow city government
and the ministry. Memorial is an informal organization that has not
been able to hold a founding conference. That conference is
scheduled for late January.
   The competition's rules call for the construction of a single
monument in Moscow. But Memorial seeks a more comprehensive center
to educate people about Stalin's terror through the use of archives
and other historical materials, and local Memorial chapters are
pushing for similar projects in other cities.
   ``The monument will be built in Moscow. Nothing is said about any
other place,'' Yevtushenko said. ``What's actually happening? We
have to think about the whole country _ all the republics suffered.''
   The well-known poet said he had called Culture Minister Vasily
Zakharov to express Memorial's willingness to work with the ministry
despite their differences over the project, and that he was
surprised when the details of the project were published Tuesday.
   Soviet Culture said the official competition would be divided
into two parts, an initial contest to select the site and the
general concept and a second stage to select who will work out the
final details.
   On another front, Memorial has been trying in vain to put forward
its own candidates for the new Congress of People's Deputies, a
national parliamentary body of 2,250 people.
   Authorities have not permitted the group to directly nominate
candidates because it is not an officially recognized organization,
one of Memorial's organizers, Vyacheslav Igrunov, told reporters.
   The campaign for the March 26 elections formally began Monday.

<HEAD>Vietnam Drops Condemnation Of Foreign Countries From Constitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoping to repair its frayed
international relations, Vietnam has amended its constitution to
delete condemnation of France, Japan, the United States and China.
   The revised preamble was adopted by the country's National
Assembly last Thursday on the closing day of its winter session. An
English-language text carried by the official Vietnam News Agency
was monitored today in Bangkok.
   The constitution hails Vietnam's victories over the countries it
has fought since Ho Chi Minh founded the Communist Party in 1930,
and sets the building of socialism as the key goal. It retains the
frequent mention of the Soviet Union as the model for Vietnam's
revolution.
   Among the 13 sentences revised in the four-page preamble, the
names of all four countries cited for criticism have been deleted.
   In the third sentence of the preamble, for example, the phrase
``the Japanese, French and American imperialists'' has been changed
to ``the aggressors.'' The ``anti-French resistance'' has been
changed to ``the anti-colonial resistance,'' and the ``the war of
resistance to U.S. aggression'' to ``the war against aggression.''
   The most extensive deletion was of language condemning China, the
giant northern neighbor with whom Vietnam the past couple years has
made the most concerted efforts to reach rapprochement.
   The 1980 preamble said:
   ``No sooner had they emerged from 30 years of liberation war than
our people, who were longing for peace to build their homeland, were
confronted with the Chinese hegemonist aggressors and their henchmen
in Kampuchea (Cambodia).
   ``Promoting our glorious national traditions, our army and people
won resounding victories in both wars for national defense against
the aggression by Kampuchean reactionaries on the south-western
border and the Chinese hegemonists on the northern border,
safeguarding our independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial
integrity.''
   The new preamble says:
   ``After 30 years of liberation war, our people are longing for
peace to build their homeland, at the same time constantly promoting
the glorious traditions of the nation and continuing their staunch
struggle to firmly defend their independence, national sovereignty,
reunification and territorial integrity.''
   Vietnam's Communist Party has been in constant war, against the
French colonial rulers, the Japanese occupiers during World War II,
then the Americans who backed South Vietnam until its defeat in
April 1975.
   Once close ties with China ended with a bloody 1979 border war,
and Vietnam has become an international pariah state since its
forces invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day 1978.
   Since coming to power in December 1986, pragmatists led by
Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Van Linh have concentrated
on economic development, pursued negotiations on the Cambodian
issue, and declared Vietnam's desire to become an accepted member of
the international community.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Interior Department May Open Parks To Coal Mining</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department is moving to clear up
claims to development rights on federal parklands and insisting
there will no mining or other private development on protected lands.
   The department proposed rules, published in Tuesday's Federal
Register, that would allow the laws of individual states to
determine who has the right to mine coal from national parks,
wildlife refuges, wilderness areas and other protected federal
lands, The New York Times reported today.
   The Times said some 4 million acres of federal parkland would be
potentially open to coal mining.
   But the department also published a policy statement saying that
private work such as coal mining will not be allowed on the lands
despite the claims, according to Andre Bogolubov, director of public
relations for the Interior Department.
   ``There will be no timber harvesting, development or mining in
national parks, in statutorily protected areas,'' Bogolubov said in
a telephone interview early today with The Associated Press.
   Congress prohibited coal mining on parklands and other protected
federal holdings in 1977 but made an exception for holders of mining
claims that were valid at the time.
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel has repeatedly said he would
not allow mining in national parks.
   Bogolubov said the government would compensate those who have
valid rights, either with land elsewhere or by purchasing the rights.
   ``A lot of people claim to have such a right to develop
property,'' he said. ``But the definition of valid existing rights
is vague. What this (proposed rule) does is defines it by making it
clear who makes the decision and suggests criteria for making the
determination.''
   Environmentalists say buying back the mining claims could cost
millions of dollars and they criticized the proposals as a giveaway
to the coal industry, the Times reported.
   National Park Service spokesman George Berklacy told the AP late
Tuesday ``there is no reason to be concerned about'' mining in the
federal parks.
   ``The worst-case scenario would be that when an individual's
claim was authenticated as a valid existing right, the federal
government would move to compensate them,'' Berklacy said.
   Bogolubov said federal lands ``will not be mined. This will
determine if (claimants) have valid and existing rights. Then we
will move to make sure those rights will not be exercised.''
   National Park Service officials said only a few parks, including
the New River Gorge in West Virginia, were seriously threatened by
private mining claims.
   A statement by the Interior Department said the proposals were
intended to resolve conflicts involving mining claims on federal
lands and to ensure ``that private property rights are recognized,''
the newspaper said.
   How holders of private property rights are defined has been a
matter of dispute which the new rules attempt to resolve by giving
states the authority to decide whether the mining claims are valid,
according to the Times.
   Bogolubov said the rules have a 70-day comment period before
taking effect.

   The Census Bureau, in an experimental study,
says the nation's poverty rate in 1986 would have been significantly
lower than officially reported if the government had used a broader
definition of personal income.
   The study assessed poverty rates under a variety of hypothetical
definitions and found the reported 1986 poverty rate of 13.6 percent
would have been 2 percentage points lower using a definition that
excluded income taxes and payroll taxes but included non-cash
government benefits not factored into the current standard.
   The study also concluded that without Social Security, nearly
half of the elderly would fall below the poverty line. For 1986, the
poverty line was $5,701 for a single person, $5,255 for a single,
elderly person, and $11,203 for a family of four.
   The study was the first of a series of experimental reports
compiling benefit and tax data that previously had been handled in
separate reports.
   It also was the first time the Census Bureau had estimated
monetary values to recipients of non-cash benefits such as Medicare
and Medicaid.
   The government's current definition of income includes all cash
pre-tax income except capital gains, including government benefits
such as Social Security, veterans' benefits, unemployment and
workers' compensation insurance and public assistance.
   Some liberal groups have protested the use of pre-tax income for
determining the poverty level, saying it failed to take into account
what the individuals had left over after paying taxes.
   Conservatives, on the other hand, argued that non-cash benefits _
such as Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, school-lunch and rent
subsidies _ should be included as income when determining the
poverty level, because these programs enhance the quality of the
recipients' lives.
   Using the current definition, the overall national poverty rate
in 1986 was 13.6 percent. Among whites it was 11 percent, among
blacks 31.1 percent and among Hispanics 27.3 percent.
   If the definition were amended to include non-cash benefits and
capital gains, the overall poverty rate in 1986 would have been 11.6
percent, the Census Bureau reported. Among whites it would have been
9.4 percent, among blacks 25.8 percent and among Hispanics 23.5
percent.
   The new study listed hypothetical poverty rates under a variety
of possible income definitions, including one used in the private
sector: income excluding cash-paid government benefits such as
Social Security while adding employer-provided health benefits.
   Comparing the poverty rate among the elderly using the current
government standard and the private-sector formula shows the
striking effect of Social Security.
   Using the government formula, 12.4 percent of those over 65 years
old lived in poverty in 1986. Under the private-sector definition
that excludes Social Security, the poverty rate for that age group
was 48.5 percent.
   In addition to assessing the effect of various government
programs and definitions of income on poverty, the study listed an
index of income concentration under each experimental definition.
   Under the official definition of income, the Census Bureau
reported that aggregate household income in 1986 was $2.75 trillion,
with a median household income of $24,897. The index of income
concentration showed that the bottom 20 percent of households
received 3.8 percent of total income while the top 20 percent
received 46.1 percent.
   If all government benefits were subtracted from the income
definition and employer-paid health benefits were included, 52.4
percent of all income was received by the top 20 percent of
households and just 1 percent by the bottom 20 percent.
   The effect of taxes on poverty varied depending on the type of
household, the study said.
   Among married-couple families, for example, subtracting taxes
from the current income definition increased the poverty rate from
9.4 percent to 10.6 percent among whites, from 15.8 percent to 18.5
percent among blacks and from 23.8 percent to 26.6 percent among
Hispanics.
   In single-parent, female-headed households, subtracting taxes
increased the poverty rate among whites from 47.4 percent to 49.9
percent. For blacks, it increased from 64.7 percent to 67.9 percent
and for Hispanics, the rate increased from 65 percent to 68.5
percent.
   Income definitions that included all government benefits, on the
other hand, produced sizeable reductions in the poverty rates
although some groups still were characterized by high rates.
   For example, the poverty rate in single-parent, female-headed
households dropped from 49.9 percent to 34.2 percent among whites
when government benefits were counted in the income definition.
Among such households headed by blacks, the rate dropped from 67.9
percent to 49.7 percent; by Hispanics from 68.5 percent to 47.7
percent.

<HEAD>Government Orders Crackdown On Violent Radicals, Labor Protests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo ordered a
crackdown on political and labor unrest today and warned that
violent protests are threatening South Korea's political and
economic stability.
   In an unusually tough statement, Roh issued a ``special
directive'' to police and security forces to halt violent protests
and labor strikes, attacks on government buildings and other
political violence.
   ``Unlawful and disorderly developments and excessive demands
gushing forth in the course of liquidating authoritarianism ... are
threatening not only democracy but also the stability of the free
economy,'' he told a meeting of key government officials.
   Opposition and dissident groups immediately denounced Roh's
statement and accused the government of seeking excuses to oppress
opponents and avoid any loss of authority. The National Assembly is
controlled by the opposition.
   Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung called Roh's directive ``a
plot schemed by fascists not to lose their invested rights.''
   Government leaders are concerned protests could increase
opposition to Roh because of public anger over revelations of
corruption and human rights abuses under his predecessor, former
President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Roh is resisting widespread demands that Chun be punished.
   Radical students and dissidents have staged a series of violent
protests in recent months to demand the overthrow of the Roh
government. Radicals have also staged scattered attacks on
government and U.S. military facilities.
   The protests have been small compared to major anti-government
protests in 1987. But officials have expressed concern at the
increasing use of violence.
   Roh said today that radicals' use of firebombs and homemade
explosives in protests had ``reached a serious phase.'' No deaths
and just a few serious injuries have been reported in recent
protests.
   The president also expressed concern about frequent violent
strikes and warned that labor unrest threatens economic stability.
He said the government supports peaceful and legal trade union
activity, but warned that violence and excessive union demands would
not be tolerated.
   Roh said the transition to democracy has made great progress and
violent extremists would not be allowed to pose a threat to national
stability or the desire of the great majority of Koreans for orderly
change.
   ``Law and order will be thoroughly established,'' he said.
   Commenting on the speech, Kim accused government hardliners of
attempting to create a false sense of crisis to frighten people into
supporting Roh and justifying restraints on government opponents.
   Roh is under political pressure because he is a former ally of
Chun and some Koreans identified him with his predecessor.
   He has promised to hold a referendum on his rule sometime next
year and government leaders fear the controversy surrounding Chun
could damage Roh's chances of winning and threaten his hold on power.
   The president reportedly is also under pressure from government
hardliners unhappy about political protests and growth of opposition
and left-wing groups.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went into rural exile last month after apologizing for abuses
under his rule.
   Roh, also a former general, won presidential elections one year
ago and has dismantled most of the authoritarian controls enacted by
Chun.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks At Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen today,
while Tokyo's leading stock index closed the last trading day of the
year, a ``festival market,'' at a record high.
   The dollar opened at 125.17 yen and closed at 125.27 yen, up 0.47
yen from Tuesday's close of 124.80 yen.
   An exchange dealer at the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar's
strength here followed a dollar-buying drive in New York ``based on
actual demand.'' In New York, the dollar closed at 124.92 yen on
Tuesday.
   Another exchange dealer said trading was relatively slow because
many dealers are on year-end vacations.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which reached the 30,000-level Tuesday for the
second time ever, added another 108.07 points, or 0.36 percent,
closing at a record 30,159.00 points.
   Today's session was only a half day, ending with blue- and
gray-suited traders jamming the exchange floor to loudly applaud the
end of 1988 trading. The market will reopen on Jan. 4 with another
half-day session.
   Traders said it is the Japanese market's tradition to try to end
the year in a bullish mood.
   ``It makes us and investors feel like the market is going to open
strong after the New Year,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer at
Nikko Securities Co. ``Today's market is like a festival market.''
   Wantanabe also said major brokerages customarily push share
prices up at the year-end.
   The market's key indicator first broke the 30,000-level on Dec.
7, when it closed at 30,050.82, but it slipped back the following
day on profit-taking. It regained the 30,000-level Tuesday, when it
closed at 30,050.93 points.
   Analysts said the market outlook was favorable because Japan's
brisk economic growth is expected to continue through mid-1989.
   ``My estimate is the current economic growth will continue at
least until the middle of next year, and then it may show a little
slowdown,'' said Mike Morizumi at Merrill Lynch's Tokyo office.
``But unless some dramatic changes occur ... the market's
bullishness will probably continue.''

<HEAD>Woman Gives Birth Aboard Jumbo Jet Over Atlantic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman gave birth two months prematurely aboard a
jumbo jet flying at 39,000 feet from Barbados to Britain, her
husband too shocked to do anything but hold her hand, a newspaper
reported today.
   Catherine Faye Capaldi was born on Monday, the day after
Christmas, while the British Airways Boeing 747 was over the
Atlantic, the Times of London said.
   The aircraft was diverted to Shannon airport in Ireland after the
baby was born. An ambulance rushed the baby and her mother,
31-year-old Maureen Capaldi of London, to St. Munchin's maternity
hospital at Limerick, it said.
   The baby weighed 3 pounds, 11 ounces at birth and mother and
daughter were reported doing well, the paper said.
   Mrs. Capaldi, 31 weeks into her pregnancy, was within one week of
the recommended limit for pregnant air travelers and went into labor
three hours after the plane took off, it said.
   The paper quoted the plane's co-pilot, Nick Eades, as saying:
``It was getting a bit panicky and I went (to the passenger section)
to give reassurance, convinced that the birth was not going to take
place. But by the time I got there, it was all happening.
   ``The head was already out. When the contractions stopped, the
baby was there. It was really a do-it-yourself birth.''
   Eades was quoted as saying it was 30 minutes before the baby
breathed unaided. ``We thought the little mite wasn't going to
live,'' he told the paper.
   ``A stewardess got a suction line from the medical kit while I
tried artificial respiration. We decided to leave well alone and not
cut the umbilical cord.
   ``I then rushed back to the flight deck to (help to) land the
airplane. Mrs. Capaldi was very calm throughout. But her husband
(Franco Capaldi) was too shocked to do anything except hold his
wife's hand.''

<HEAD>Report On Deaths Among Aborigines In Police Custody Urges Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To stem a rash of aborigine deaths in
police custody, a government report today urged that drunkenness be
abolished as an offense and racist police officers be replaced by
aboriginal recruits.
   The preliminary report calls for widespread changes in
Australia's legal, police, prison and medical systems to tackle the
problem and warns that a failure to institute such changes would
damage Australia's reputation abroad.
   It was issued by James Muirhead, a lawyer who Prime Minister Bob
Hawke appointed last year as head of a royal commission formed to
investigate the deaths of 44 aborigines in police custody since 1980.
   The commission was to have concluded its probe this week, but the
number of aborigine deaths in police custody has more than doubled
to 100 since it began work. Most aborigines have died in police
cells by hanging after being picked up on charges of being drunk and
disorderly.
   Aboriginal activists charge police brutality.
   Muirhead said the increase in his workload means the final report
will be delayed by two years. In the meantime, he issued 56
recommendations to prevent more aborigines from dying in custody.
   In the report, Muirhead also criticizes attempts that have been
made to hamper his investigation.
   ``It will be unfortunate if the work of this commission is
impeded by narrow, selfish or political considerations,'' he says.
``Our performance is being assessed not only in this country but in
overseas forums and I fear that our country's reputation will suffer
if expediency rather than honesty prevails.
   ``Australia must know the truth behind the deaths or else we must
forever live with the knowledge that our fear of the truth or our
misguided sense of priorities caused us to abandon an essential and
momentous decision to examine a little of our national character and
the behavior of people in authority.'' In Western Australia, the
state where there the most deaths have occurred, police and prison
officers' unions, backed by the state government, have launched a
federal court challenge to some of the commission's powers.
   A royal commission has wider powers than any judicial body in the
country, but is not empowered to pass legal judgment. Its findings,
however, can result in legal action at the state and federal level.
   Aborigines, the country's original inhabitants, number about
160,000, or 1 percent of Australia's 16 million people.
   The inquiry comes at a particularly sensitive time with ongoing
bicentennial celebrations marking European settlement. Aboriginal
activitists have declared 1988 a year of mourning.
   Muirhead, says in his report that governments at the state and
federal level should legislate to ensure that jail is used only as a
last resort for drunkenness.
   Justice Minister Michael Tate said the federal government
generally agrees with the thrust of the report.
   Muirhead refused comment beyond his recommendations, which
included:
   _ That drunkenness be abolished as an offense, accompanied by
programs to treat alcohol abuse and changes to the law to force
police to consider alternatives to jail for drunk people; that a
national task force be set up to examine social and health problems
among aborigines caused by alcohol abuse;
   _ That people found unconscious by police should be taken to a
hospital or a qualified health worker and not to jail. He encouraged
the recruitment of aboriginal police and prison officers, and
screening to prevent racist police and prison officers from being
retained.
   Federal statistics show that aboriginal life expectancy is 20
years less than for other Australians, while infant mortality among
aborigines is almost three times higher than among non-aborigines.
   Aborigines, according to government figures, also have a far
higher rate of diseases like trachoma while imprisonment rates for
aborigines are 16 times higher than the national average.
   Aboriginal unemployment is some six times the national average.
There are virtually no aborigines in professions such as law,
education and medicine despite millions of dollars each year in
federal funds for aborigines.

<HEAD>Rightist Death Squad Vows Eye-For-Eye Retributions Against Leftists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new right-wing death squad is
promising bloody retribution for any killings, car bombings and
death threats by leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, according to a
communique.
   ``The only way to achieve the total extermination of this horde
of terrorist killers is by the same means and with the same force
they use,'' says the communique issued by a group calling itself the
Revolutionary Anti-Communist Exterminating Action, or ARDE.
   The group threatened to kill two leftist leaders for each person
the guerrillas kidnap or kill; to bomb the house of one leftist
leader for every car bomb; and to kill one leftist for each mayor
forced to resign under death threats from leftist guerrillas.
   The communique was delivered to media outlets last weekend, and
several radio stations began broadcasting it Tuesday.
   In the early 1980s, death squads regularly issued communiques
threatening individuals or leftist groups, and those threats were
frequently carried out. The last such communique was issued in June
1987.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a coalition of
five leftist guerrilla groups that have been fighting the government
since 1979, has set off several car bombs in San Salvador in recent
months.
   On Friday, guerrillas attacked the Defense Ministry headquarters
compound on the edge of the capital with four car bombs and
explosives, killing four people and wounding 35.
   The same day, unidentified terrorists attacked the National
University, which rightists have often accused of being a center of
leftist activity. A night watchman was killed and the biology lab
building was blown up.
   Death threats from guerrillas have forced 18 mayors from small
provincial towns to resign during the past three months.
   The ARDE communique, dated Dec. 21, was delivered by hand to five
newspapers, four television stations and six radio stations. It said
the media would ``be attacked drastically'' if they did not publish
the communique for three consecutive days.
   The communique contains a list of leftist leaders, headed by top
Liberation Front commanders Shafick Handal and Ferman Cienfuegos,
who it said would be killed in reprisals.
   It also listed among possible victims Guillermo Ungo, a leftist
candidate in presidential elections next March, and Ruben Zamora,
his campaign coordinator. Both belong to the Democratic
Revolutionary Front, a non-fighting coalition of leftist parties,
movements and student and labor unions closely allied with the
Liberation Front.
   Zamora, who returned to El Salvador in November 1987 after seven
years of exile, said in a telephone interview that the threats
``show that ultra-rightist sectors are desperate because we are on
the right electoral path, and we will not retreat in the face of
threats and blackmail.''
   An estimated 65,500 people have been killed since guerrillas
launched a civil war in 1979 against a succession of U.S.-supported
governments. Human rights groups say most of the victims have been
civilians, slain by left- or right-wing death squads.
   Right-wing death squads, organized or tolerated by the military,
were blamed for thousands of slayings from 1980 to early 1984.
   The slayings abated in July 1984, when President Jose Napoleon
Duarte's centrist Christian Democratic administration took office
after the first free elections in El Salvador and forced the
military to sever all ties with the rightist squads.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea sent a message to communist
North Korea today agreeing to high-level political and military
talks aimed at reducing tension on the divided peninsula.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon suggested in the letter to North
Korean counterpart Yon Hyung Muk that they head delegations to
alternating talks in Seoul and Pyongyang to discuss
non-interference, cooperation in select areas and building ``mutual
trust in military matters.
   ``To wipe out mutual distrust and restore trust between them the
two Koreas should recognize each others' ideologies and systems,
conduct dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference
and develop cooperative relations on the principle of mutuality
until unification is achieved,'' Kang wrote in the letter delivered
to the north at the border truce site of Panmunjom.
   But the south's response to a Nov. 16 North Korean proposal for
wide ranging talks on reduction of military forces did not appear to
go as far. The south did not refer to troop reduction and its
proposal was more vague.
   Kang made no reference to the north's proposal that talks also
negotiate withdrawal of the U.S. forces based in the south under a
mutual defense pact. The United States has 42,000 troops in the
south.
   South Korea's letter also proposed separate economic and Red
Cross talks to discuss cooperation in humanitarian and economic
areas. It proposed preliminary talks in early February to set the
terms for full negotiations.
   The south also called for prime ministers to head the
delegations, instead of deputy premiers as proposed by the north.
Procedural differences have been a major problem in arranging
north-south talks in the past.
   The rival Koreas have both been pressing major iniatives to end
the long, bitter confrontation dividing the peninsula.
   Although some progress has been made, both sides have tended to
stress their respective iniatives and play down the other's
proposals.
   Delegations of lawmakers are to resume talks Thursday at
Panmunjom on clearing the way for full-scale parliamentary talks on
a non-aggression pact and other measures. South Korean legislators
expect full talks to be held sometime next year.
   Today's letter was in response to a separate North Korean
proposal for inter-government talks. Past talks between the two
Koreas on reducing tension failed to make progress.
   South Korean officials have expressed some mistrust about the
north's intentions. They say the north's insistence on discussing
withdrawal of U.S. forces indicates Pyongyang may be using talks to
try and weaken the south.
   South Korean officials say American forces are needed for the
foreseeable future to prevent a North Korean attack. U.S. officials
have said their forces will remain in the south as long as they are
wanted by the Seoul government.
   The two Koreas have hundreds of thousands of troops facing each
other along the 150-mile border, which is sealed. There are no
communications except for a hot line.
   U.S. and Soviet forces divided the Korean peninsula when they
ended the Japanese occupation at the end of the Second World War in
1945. The north invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War.

<TEXT>
   Logan International Airport's operators haven't
ended their fight after grudgingly complying with a federal order to
halt hefty fees that were designed to dissuade small craft from
landing at the crowded airfield.
   The new landing fee system had been watched closely by the
aviation industry nationwide as a possible precedent for dealing
with congestion at major airports. Federal officials rank Logan
among the country's 10 most congested airports.
   Last week, the U.S. Department of Transportation ruled the fee
structure was unreasonable, discriminatory and in violation of
federal law.
   Deputy Transportation Secretary Mimi Weyforth Dawson signed an
order Thursday that gave the Massachusetts Port Authority seven days
to rescind its fee structure or lose eligibility for $10.2 million
in federal aviation improvement grants for this fiscal year.
   In response, Port Authority officials voted Tuesday to
temporarily suspend the increased landing fees beginning today, but
to file a request with the U.S. Court of Appeals here seeking a
review of the matter.
   ``We are simply recognizing that an aircraft carrying hundreds
and hundreds of people should not have to wait in line while a small
craft carrying maybe one or two people lands,'' said Theresa
McAlpine, a spokeswoman for the state agency.
   Bob Marx, a spokesman for the federal agency, said it would have
no comment on the Port Authority vote.
   Small aircraft lobbyists said they would continue their vigorous
opposition to the plan, which they said cost them an average of 500
percent more in fees.
   ``At this point the whole case has been ... groundbreaking. We
feel that the Department of Transportation's decision is final and
binding and certainly very clear,'' said Patricia Weil, a spokesman
for the national Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
   The Program for Airport Capacity Efficiency, which went into
effect July 1, was intended to reduce congestion and delays by
charging fees so high they would discourage users of small craft
from flying in and out of Logan.
   Under the new fee structure, all planes were assessed an $88 flat
fee and 47 cents per 1,000 pounds. The old system charged $1.31 per
1,000 pounds or $25, whichever was greater.
   The new fee for a Boeing 747, for example, dropped to $450 from
$680, while a Cessna 402 seating 10 passengers was charged $106
versus $25, McAlpine said.
   Organizations representing small aircraft pilots reacted by
filing complaints in court and with the federal Department of
Transportation.

   An agent who owns the rights to the story

bargaining power against studios.
   Although the original 1954 Alfred Hitchcock film was made with
the permission of the story's author, Cornell Woolrich, that
authority didn't extend to the new theater and cable release in the
early 1980s, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday.
   Woolrich had died by the time of the new release and his initial
copyright period had expired, the court noted.
   The 2-1 ruling allows Sheldon Abend, the New York agent who owns
the copyright to Woolrich's story, to pursue his damage suit against
Hitchcock's estate.
   The court, however, rejected Abend's attempt to halt further
distribution of ``Rear Window,'' saying the movie's success was
largely unrelated to the short story.
   Abend's lawyer, Peter J. Anderson, said the ruling means that
``the surviving spouses and estates of authors are going to get some
compensation for continued use of the authors' literary property.''
   Defense lawyer Louis Petrich said he planned to appeal. His
clients include actor James Stewart, who besides starring in the
film owns part of it.
   The ruling is ``not what you would call pro-author since it is
absolutely contrary to the interests of the authors of the movie ...
the owners, (and) Hitchcock and Stewart,'' Petrich said.
   Woolrich published the short story ``It Had To Be Murder'' in a
1942 issue of Dime Detective Magazine. The rights were later bought
by Paramount Pictures for ``Rear Window.''
   Anderson said the story contained most of the plot of the movie
about a wheelchair-bound man who gathers evidence of a murder while
viewing neighbors from his apartment window. Stewart's love
interest, played by Grace Kelly, was not a character in the story,
Anderson said.
   In selling the film rights for $9,250, Woolrich promised to renew
the rights for an additional 28 years, the period provided by law,
after his original 28-year copyright expired. But Woolrich died in
1968, before the first period expired. In 1972, Abend bought the
rights to the short story from Woolrich's estate for $650 plus 10
percent of the proceeds.
   Relying on a 1977 ruling by a New York-based federal appeals
court in another case, the owners of ``Rear Window'' released the
film again for theater and home viewing in the early 1980s,
producing more than $12 million in revenue, the court said.
   Abend then sued, claiming copyright violation.
   U.S. District Judge A. Andrew Hauk of Los Angeles dismissed the
suit, saying the makers of ``Rear Window'' had properly acquired a
continuing copyright in the film during Woolrich's lifetime.
   But the appeals court Tuesday disagreed with Hauk and with the
1977 ruling, saying Abend could be entitled to damages.

<HEAD>Poll Says 82 Percent Of Britons Support Monarchy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four out of five Britons remain firmly royalist but
nearly 60 percent think Queen Elizabeth II should step down to allow
her eldest son Prince Charles to become king, according to an
opinion poll published today.
   The Gallup poll, published in The Daily Telegraph newspaper,
reported 82 percent of those questioned said they were in favor of
the British monarchy, just 14 percent wanted it abolished and the
rest expressed no opinion.
   But 59 percent said they thought the 62-year-old queen should
``retire'' early, allowing 40-year-old Charles to become king.
   Because of the disgrace surrounding the abdication in 1936 of the
queen's uncle King Edward VIII, later the Duke of Windsor, in order
to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, the queen has said she
will never abdicate the throne.
   This could mean a long wait for Charles. His
great-great-grandfather, King Edward VII, had to wait until he was
59 years old before he succeeded to the thone in 1901 on the death
of his mother, Queen Victoria, at age 81.
   Charles, whose concern for the poor, homeless and what he regards
as the uglier aspects of modern architecture have won him widespread
public support, heads the list of most popular royals, according to
the poll. It said 21 percent of those questioned said Charles was
their favorite.
   A 75-minute television documentary made by the prince attacking
many modern buildings as ugly was screened by the British
Broadcasting Corp. on Oct. 28. A newspaper survey at the time said
75 percent of Britons agreed with him.
   In today's poll, 19 percent of respondents said Elizabeth the
Queen Mother, Charles' 88-year-old grandmother, was their favorite;
17 percent favored his 38-year-old sister Princess Anne; 12 percent
liked his 27-year-old wife Princess Diana best; and 11 percent liked
the queen most.
   Despite the overwhelming support for the monarchy, 40 percent of
presondents said they thought the $9.45 million in taxpayers' money
paid last year to support the royals was too much.
   The queen, one of the world's richest people, has a personal
fortune estimated earlier this year by the London business
publication Money Magazine at $6 billion. But she and some other
royals also receive an annual grant of taxpayers' money voted by
Parliament to help them with the cost of their official duties,
upkeep of palaces and other expenses.
   Asked whether they themselves would want to be members of the
royal family, 89 percent of those questioned in the poll said no.
   The poll was based on interviews with 918 people around Britain.
It stated no margin of error.

   A minor earthquake shook central Maine
early today, prompting scores of calls to police but causing no
serious damage or reports of injuries, authorities said.
   The tremor struck at 1:29 a.m. and registered about 2.5 to 3 on
the Richter scale, according to Marvin Carlson, a geophysicist at
the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   Carlson said the general area of the quake was east of
Waterville, a city about 30 miles inland.
   Police Sgt. Jeff Massey said the quake lasted about 15 seconds.
   ``Several people thought it was an explosion,'' Massey said.
``The switchboard just lit up. ... Most people called and said they
thought their furnace blew up. One lady said she thought her husband
fell out of bed.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan and other U.S. officials
marked the ninth anniversary of Soviet intervention in Afghanistan
stressing that they expect Moscow to honor its commitment to
complete military withdrawal by Feb. 15.
   Failure to meet the deadline would get Moscow ``off to a very bad
start'' with President-elect Bush's incoming administration, warned
Michael Armacost, the State Department's undersecretary for
political affairs.
   The State Department also predicted Tuesday that the Afghan
national army will collapse after the Soviet withdrawal is completed
and that some top leaders of the Kabul government regarded by the
populace as traitors might choose to flee the country.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan on Dec. 27, 1979.
Western analysts say their were 110,000 to 115,000 Soviet troops in
the country supporting the government against rebels armed by the
United States. About half have been withdrawn.
   ``I fully expect them to honor their obligation to withdraw
completely by Feb. 15,'' President Reagan said in a statement issued
by the White House during his California vacation.
   But the president and other officials also voiced concern that
the withdrawal has been halted and Soviet offensive military
operations have resumed.
   ``Even today, as Feb. 15 approaches, the Soviets continue
offensive military operations in Afghanistan,'' Reagan said. ``The
introduction of new weapons, and the escalation in the use of Soviet
warplanes in bombing raids against Afghanistan call into question
the Soviet commitment to a peaceful solution.''
   In a report released Tuesday on the military situation in
Afghanistan, the State Department said the rebels made sizable gains
this year despite the introduction of Backfire bombers and other new
weapons by the Soviets.
   The report called the Afghan army ``demoralized force'' suffering
shortages of qualified officers and manpower, despite forced
conscriptions and bribes of tribal militia.
   ``Most experts agree that it probably can survive no more than a
matter of months after a complete Soviet withdrawal,'' it said.
   The report also hailed talks earlier this year the Soviets had
with resistance leaders without representatives of the Kabul
government. ``Moscow now appears ready to explore all options that
could lead to a political settlement,'' the report said.

<BYLINE>Passenger Arrested After Jet Lands for Bomb Search

<TEXT>
   A literature professor aboard an
American Airlines jet was arrested on charges of issuing a bomb
threat that forced the Boeing 767 to make an emergency landing at
Albuquerque International Airport.
   Flight 240 bound for Dallas from San Francisco with 198 people
aboard was evacuated on a remote stretch of runway Tuesday, but
searchers using bomb-sniffing dogs found no bomb or weapon,
authorities said.
   ``The initial investigation revealed that a passenger was in
possession of a note indicating there were bombs planted on the
aircraft,'' FBI agent James W. Nelson said in a statement.
   ``The passenger gave the note to a flight attendant, who relayed
the information to the pilot. ... The FBI, after a lengthy interview
of the passenger, took him into custody.''
   The suspect was identified as Peter M. Canning, 40, a literature
professor at the University of California at Berkeley. A colleague,
Dr. Avital Ronell, said in a telephone interview from Berkeley that
Canning denied the charges over the phone Tuesday night.
   ``He didn't do it. He handed a note that dropped on his lap from
the stewardess' tray,'' Ms. Ronell said. ``The stewardess was
walking by, and it dropped on his lap.''
   Canning's girlfriend, Rhonda Lieberman, said from Berkeley that
he had been flying to New Orleans for a convention of the Modern
Language Association.
   ``This sounds like a major misunderstanding,'' said Ms.
Lieberman. ``It's an absolute disgrace. I can't believe they are
doing this to him.''
   Canning was taken to the Bernalillo County jail, where he was
held for investigation of charges pertaining to destruction of
aircraft and bomb threats made aboard aircraft, Nelson said.
   Canning was scheduled for an initial appearance before a U.S.
magistrate today, and bail was to be set then, Nelson said. If
convicted, he could face up to five years in jail, a $5,000 fine or
both, Nelson said.
   American spokesman Jim Brown said nobody was injured in the
incident, and the plane resumed its flight about 4{ hours after it
landed.
   Passenger Sandra Klein, 22, of Manchester, Calif., said the crew
didn't announce anything was wrong, and none of the passengers heard
about the incident until after the jet landed.
   ``Everyone was calm. I was amazed. Most of us thought there was a
lavatory fire or something like that,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Snow fell in the Midwest today, stranding hundreds of travelers
in St. Louis, after tornadoes and thunderstorms demolished trailers,
blew roofs off houses or uprooted utility poles in the South.
   Twisters or strong winds struck Tuesday in Arkansas, Mississippi,
Louisiana and Texas, and tornado watches remained in effect today in
Louisiana and Mississppi. Snowstorms that began Tuesday continued
today in Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri and Illinois
   In Mississippi, thunderstorm winds destroyed a mobile home in
Minter City, and demolished a trailer in Anguilla, the National
Weather Service said. A tornado reported in Belzoni damaged three
mobile homes, a car and a service station, and a twister touched
down near Lake Horn, Miss., just southwest of Memphis, Tenn.
   Tornadoes also touched down near West Memphis and Marion, Ark.
   Thunderstorm winds blew out windows in Natchez, Miss., and
uprooted seven utility poles and blew roofs off houses elsewhere in
the state, the weather service said. Winds gusting to 81 mph were
recorded in Rolling Fork.
   Strong winds overturned trailers and downed trees near Lake
Providence, La., and 66 mph gusts blew through Beaumont, Texas.
   In Indiana, a winter storm warning was posted and up to 8 inches
of snow were expected.
   In St. Louis, which had 5 inches of snow by late Tuesday, the
storm caused TWA to cancel 110 of 120 flights Tuesday night for
Lambert Airport, said TWA spokesman Bob Blattner. The airline
reserved 800 hotel rooms for passengers, he said.
   Meanwhile, things were returning to normal at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport, where a snowstorm stranded thousands of
travelers Tuesday.
   Sections of the northern California coast that hadn't gotten any
snow in 12 years got a dusting Tuesday, causing a pileup of more
than 30 cars and a liquid propane tanker spill, closing highways,
forcing the homeless into shelters and worrying citrus growers. No
serious injuries were reported.
   In Utah, fog and ice Tuesday triggered a 67-car pileup on
Interstate 215 south of Salt Lake City, leaving 15 people with minor
injuries.
   Elsewhere today, rain spread from Ohio to Pennsylvania and New
York state, and sleet fell on Lower Michigan. A mix of rain and snow
fell over California's Sacramento Valley late Tuesday, and falling
temperatures were expected to make area roads icy.
   The nation's high Tuesday was 88 degrees in McAllen and Beeville,
Texas, where President-elect Bush was hunting quail
   Today's forecast called for snow from northern New England to
northern New York state, northwest Ohio, northern Indiana and
Michigan and in the Arizona mountains; snow becoming rain from the
rest of New England to the Virginias and the rest of the Ohio
Valley; showers from the inland Carolinas to the Tennessee Valley
and the central Gulf Coast and in Southern California; rain along
the northern Pacific Coast, changing to snow in the Pacific
Northwest.
   High temperatures were forecast in the single digits from eastern
Montana to North Dakota and Minnesota; the teens and 20s from the
rest of the upper Great Lakes to the remaining upper two-thirds of
the Mississippi Valley, South Dakota and northern Nebraska, and from
Montana to northern New Mexico, northern Arizona and Nevada. The 30s
and 40s were expected in northern New England, the lower Great
Lakes, the lower Ohio Valley and Arkansas, and from southern
Nebraska to Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandel, and in the northern
two-thirds of the Pacific Coast; the 70s in South Carolina,
southeast Georgia and the Florida Panhandlel; the 80s in the Florida
Peninsula and the 50s and 60s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from minus 15
degrees at Havre, Mont., to 75 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>`King of the Wildcatters' Glenn McCarthy Dies at 81</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent oilman Glenn Herbert McCarthy, who
became known as ``King of the Wildcatters'' and whose life was the
subject of the movie ``Giant,'' died one day after his 81st birthday.
   McCarthy, one of the world's most successful independent oilmen,
died at a Houston nursing condominium Monday night. He had moved
into the nursing complex after a five-month stay at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital earlier this year for an undisclosed ailment.
   By his own estimate, McCarthy drilled more than 1,000 oil and gas
wells, most of them in Texas but others as far away as Egypt and
Bolivia. His wealth in 1949 was estimated at $200 million.
   During his heyday, McCarthy lived in a mansion and surrounded
himself with Hollywood celebrities and powerful politicians. His
6.75-carat diamond ring earned him the nickname of ``Diamond Glenn''
and he was featured on the cover of Time magazine in the 1950s.
   In one interview, McCarthy said he was dubbed ``The King of the
Wildcatters'' by famed World War II journalist Ernie Pyle. A
90-proof Kentucky bourbon bearing the label ``Glenn McCarthy's
Wildcatter'' went on the market in 1965.
   His reputation as a bad boy was enhanced by Edna Ferber's
best-selling book ``Giant,'' which was based on McCarthy. The movie
of the same title starred James Dean, Rock Hudson and Elizabeth
Taylor.
   McCarthy owned a 15,000-acre ranch in West Texas and through the
years bought cattle, a radio station, two banks, newspapers,
chemical companies, steel mills, a motion picture production
company, an export-import company, thousands of acres of valuable
real estate and the Shell building. He served as chairman of Eastern
Airlines and president of the U.S. Petroleum Association.
   McCarthy was born Christmas Day 1907 in Beaumont, the son of an
itinerant oil field worker. As a boy, he carried drinking water to
workers at the Spindletop oilfields.
   After dropping out of college, McCarthy bought and sold a
cleaning business and two filling stations before he struck out on
his own in the oil business.
   By age 26, he had founded two oil fields, extended a third and
become a millionaire. He had his first strike at Anahuac, an oil
field where the major oil companies had drilled only dry holes and
geologists said there was no oil. In the early 1950s, his luck began
running out. He began losing his fortune on West Texas oil wells
that didn't produce and because government oil price ceilings
reduced his earnings. Insurance companies that financed McCarthy's
oil-well risks took over most of his investments.
   In his later years, he settled into a low-profile lifestyle and
lived in a two-story house near La Porte.
   McCarthy is survived by his wife, Faustine Lee McCarthy, and four
children, Glenna Lee, Leah, Faustine and Glenn McCarthy Jr.

   Finnish police said today they closed
their investigation of telephone bomb threats to the U.S. Embassy in
Helsinki after finding no link between the calls and the Pan Am air
tragedy in Scotland.
   Security Police chief Seppo Tiitinen was quoted on national radio
as saying the outcome of a probe by Britain police of a possible
suitcase bomb would in ``no way change the results of our
investigations.''
   ``Although two cases of bomb threats had similar traits to what
happened in Scotland, we have found no connection between these
calls and (the Dec. 21) crash,'' Tiitinen said. The case was closed,
he added.
   British investigators were studying a torn suitcase and pieces of
wreckage to see whether they reveal traces of a bomb that may have
caused an explosion, killing all 259 people on board and 11 in the
village of Lockerbie.
   On Tuesday, FBI officials were reported as saying no link had
been found between the bomb threats to the Helsinki embassy and the
crash of Flight 103, a New York-bound Boeing 747.
   Tiitanen said the U.S. Embassy was warned on Dec. 5 that an Arab
residing in Finland would plant a bomb aboard an American airliner
originating from Frankfurt, West Germany, ``within a couple of
weeks.'' Flight 103, via London, had originated in Frankfurt with a
Boeing 727.
   The caller, also believed to be an Arab, had issued similar
warnings to the Israeli and U.S. embassies here earlier this year,
police said.
   Tiitinen said each call was taken seriously, but that the calls
apparently were prompted by a personal feud between the two Arabs.
   Police had questioned the man the caller accused of preparing the
bomb on several occasions, but refused to disclose his identity.
   ``He is a man who has been living in Finland for some time and is
married to a Finnish woman, and he has no record of trouble with the
police,'' Tiitinen said earlier.

   The dollar rose against all major foreign
currencies except the Canadian dollar in early European trading
today. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar surged in earlier
trading in the Far East on heavy buying by commercial customers. The
West German central bank reportedly intervened in the market when
the dollar reached the 1.7900 mark-level.
   ``It (the dollar) is still very well supported, but a bit more
cautious after the Bundesbank showed its face,'' said one dealer at
a U.S. bank in Frankfurt.
   Trading was thin, with many European dealers and customers on
holiday until the New Year. Today was the first post-Christmas
trading day in London, although markets on the Continent reopened
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.47 yen to a closing 125.27. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 125.73 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning in London, compared with late
Tuesday's rates in Europe:
   _1.7915 West German marks, up from 1.7760
   _1.5143 Swiss francs, up from 1.49875
   _6.1175 French francs, up from 6.0675
   _2.0170 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0050
   _1,315.50 Italian lire, upfrom 1,308.10
   _1.1955 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19575
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7890, compared with $1.8030
in Europe late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $415.75 a troy ounce,
down from $417.75 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.65.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $414.25, down from $418.50 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $417.45, down $1.45
from Saturday.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.11 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $6.12.

Tuesday they usually buy 20 Lotto tickets a week, but they formed a
partnership with their two daughters to buy about 70 for the
Illinois State Lottery's second-largest jackpot on Saturday night.
   ``When I found the winning ticket, I realized we had matched four
of the numbers and I thought we had won 80 bucks,'' said Evancho, a
trucking manager for a manufacturing company.
   ``But when I looked closely, I saw all six numbers and all I
could say was, `Oh, my God!' _ I must have said it about 12 times!
Now I know what it's like to go into shock.''
   Evancho, 60, said he won the drawing on numbers he always plays,
8, 9, 27, 33, 43 and 54. They were chosen for the birthdays of his
wife and daughters, his age when he learned he had throat cancer,
and other personally significant numbers.
   Doctors declared him cancer-free after a post-surgical exam two
years ago, Evancho said, and then he started using his cigar money
for the lottery.
   Maryanne Evancho, 62, a computer operator for a sand and gravel
company, said she quit her job Monday, after she and her husband
confirmed they won the drawing. Her husband said she suffers from
crippling arthritis, and a doctor had advised them to move to a
warmer climate.
   Evancho says he now plans to retire early and move to Arizona.
   ``Maybe this lottery will extend her life a few more years than
if she were living in cold Wisconsin,'' he said.
   The Evancho daughters, Darlene, 36, and Cynthia, 28, who are both
single, said they have not decided what to do with their shares.
   ``I'm an accountant. ... I'm not going to be foolish,'' said
Cynthia. ``We agreed that no one would tell the other how to spend
their money.''
   Darlene teaches mentally retarded high school students.
   The state's highest Lotto jackpot was $40 million, won on Sept.
1, 1984.

<HEAD>Police Find Charred Bodies Of 44 Anti-Government Militants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The charred bodies of 44 suspected
anti-government militants were found this week in southern Sri
Lanka, a senior police officer said today.
   The victims had been shot to death and then burned with tires in
southern Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese heartland, said the officer,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In a communique, the government blamed the murders on a new
extremist group that has been targeting Sinhalese militants,
claiming they are responsible for the escalating ethnic violence on
this tropical Indian Ocean island.
   At least 19 bodies were found Monday and Tuesday along roads
about 110 miles south of Colombo, the officer said.
   The People's Liberation Front, comprised of militant Sinhalese,
opposes the government's efforts to end the 5-year insurgency by
Tamil extremists who are demanding a separate homeland in the north
and east. More than 8,500 people have died in the fighting.
   The Tamils are mostly Hindu and make up 18 percent of the
island's population. They have long accused the majority Sinhalese
of denying them jobs and education. The Sinhalese, predominantly
Buddhists, comprise 75 percent of the population.
   The Sinhalese-dominanted government signed an accord in July 1987
offering limited autonomy to the Tamils.
   Militant Tamils say the accord does not meet enough demands for
self-rule.
   But Sinhalese extremists contend the accord grants too many
concessions and have vowed to kill anyone who supports the
agreement. They have been blamed for more than 900 murders since the
accord was signed 17 months ago.
   Most of the victims have been supporters of the governing United
National Party or security personnel.
   The group the government blamed for this week's murders of
suspected Sinhalese militants is the People's Revolutionary Red
Army, which surfaced about a month ago and began hunting front
members.
   Authorities say they believe the Red Army is comprised of members
of paramilitary units, a leftist political organization and a Tamil
rebel group.

<HEAD>With PM-Aging Jetliners, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airlines will soon be asked to replace rivets in
more than 800 Boeing 727s that were made with what is now considered
an outmoded bonding process, a Federal Aviation Administration
official said.
   Darrell Pederson, a local FAA assistant manager, said Tuesday the
agency was ``very close'' to issuing a notice of proposed
rule-making, which can be followed by an airworthiness directive
after some time for public comment.
   A similar directive was issued after a 20-foot section tore loose
from an Aloha Airlines 737 jet in midflight in April, sending a
flight attendant to her death, Pederson said.
   Under that directive, Airlines had to replace more than 7,000
rivets on at least 100 older Boeing 737s at a cost of about $8
million. In addition, altitude and other restrictions were imposed
pending inspection for cracks.
   Intense inspection also is part of the proposed 727 directives,
which had been under consideration for an unspecified time before a
22-year-old Eastern Airlines 727 made an emergency landing Monday in
Charleston, W.Va., after a sudden rupture caused a 14-inch hole in
the fuselage, Pederson said.
   Boeing is based in Seattle.
   ``We will take another look at what he had planned on doing in
view of this situation,'' he said. ``If the (proposed directive)
covers it adequately, then we will proceed with that one. If there's
something new here not covered, then we will have to take some other
action.''
   He said the directive would cover 831 of the trijets _ airplanes
having three jet engines _ that were assembled by cold-bonding,
making them more susceptible to cracks than the heated adhesives to
join pieces of the fuselage, a technique Boeing adopted in 1971.
   The jet involved Monday was the 242nd of 1,831 Boeing 727s that
were produced between 1964 and 1984, when te line was discontinued.
   Craig Martin of Boeing and Ted Lopatkiewicz of the National
Transportation Safety Board said the cause of the rupture remained
under investigation. It occurred in the outer skin of the plane on
top of the fuselage near the tail in a section Martin said was
replaced sometime after the plane was delivered to Eastern in 1966.
   ``We don't know if it was a fatigue problem or skin damage from
some other cause,'' Martin said.

   An elementary school teacher who twice
tied a first-grader to her desk with string has been disciplined and
the girl transferred to another school.
   Fairdale Elementary School Principal Larry Harrison declined to
provide details on the ``approriate action'' taken against the
teacher, Ophelia Watts, citing privacy restrictions on personnel
matters.
   Judith Offutt said her 6-year-old daughter, Shari, complained
last month that she didn't want to go to school. Ms. Offutt
discovered that the girl had been tied twice with kite string.
   Ms. Offutt had been receiving weekly reports from the teacher
that Shari was doing well academically but had trouble staying at
her desk.
   The teacher and the student acknowledged that the string was
loosely placed around Shari on one occasion to demonstrate the
limits of her personal space. How tightly the string was tied the
other time is in dispute.
   Ms. Watts, who wrote Ms. Offutt an apology, declined to comment
on the advice of her attorney.

<TEXT>
   A senior PLO official said Wednesday the
organization will announce within two months a provisional
government for the independent Palestinian state declared in
Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``Within two months there will be a provisional government for
the state of Palestine,'' said Yasser Abed-Rabboo, a member of the
Palestine Liberation Organization's governing executive committee.
   Abed-Rabboo, who is visiting Amman for talks with Jordanian
officials, told reporters that the ``when and how and who'' will be
discussed at the next session of the executive committee. The
committee is scheduled to meet with leaders of other Palestinian
organizations in the second week of January.
   Another executive committee member, Mohammed Milhem, also said
the details of a government were under discussion. But he said the
PLO has not set a date for establishing the government and the
two-month deadline was Abed-Rabboo's ``personal opinion.''
   ``It may be two months, it may be four months, it may be one
month,'' he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Kuwait's Al-Watan daily today quoted a senior Palestinian source
as saying the provisional government would be named by Feb. 13.
   He said the government would be comprised of technocrats,
academics, economists and legal experts, and at least three of its
ministers would be from s say they should be based on the Israeli-occupied
territories captured in 1967.
   The 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have
been waging a yearlong uprising against the Israeli occupation.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat told reporters in Baghdad on Tuesday that
the PLO will not decide on forming the provisional government before
the organization's central council, with roughly 100 members, meets
to endorse it.
   The executive committee met in Baghdad earlier this week and
named a legal committee to study the question of a provisional
government.
   The United States opened a dialogue with the PLO earlier this
month but has not recognized the Palestinian state, saying the
Middle East conflict must be resolved through negotiations and not
unilateral acts.
   Also today, Saudi Arabia announced that the PLO office in Riyadh
will be upgraded to an embassy. A Foreign Ministry statement said
the move followed the kingdom's recognition of the Palestinian state.
   Mostly Arab countries have recognized the state.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers killed three Palestinian
guerrillas early today in a gunfight in southern Lebanon near an
Israeli border community, a military spokesman said.
   No Israeli troops were hurt in the clash, the spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   The clash began at about 3 a.m. in the Israeli-controlled
``security zone'' near the village of Meiss el-Jabal. It was near
the site where paratroopers killed three other guerrillas this week.
   In Sidon, Lebanon, the Palestinian Liberation Front said three of
its guerrillas crossed the border into northern Israel today and
clashed with Israeli troops for six hours. It said the fate of the
attackers was unknown.
   The front, whose leader, Taalat Yacoub, died of a heart attack
last month, is a small radical faction of Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, head of Israel's northern command, said
the guerrillas were trying to cross the border to launch an attack
on Kibbutz Manara, a collective farm community 100 yards from the
site of the clash.
   ``When they get within meters of a settlement it is easy to
figure out what their goal was. Their goal was the settlement,''
Peled said on Israel radio.
   The front's statement said the attack was ``dedicated as a
memorial for Yacoub, a champion of armed struggle to liberate
Palestine.'' Yacoub had his political headquarters in Syria and a
military base at the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp near Sidon in
southern Lebanon.
   The statement did not specify what the guerrillas' target was,
only that they clashed with Israeli forces.
   It was the third infiltration attempt this week and the third
since the United States agreed to a dialogue with the PLO on Dec.
14, after Arafat announced he was renouncing terrorism.
   On Monday, Israeli paratroopers killed three guerrillas near
Meiss el Jabal. Three other guerrillas drowned in a rubber dinghy
off the coast of Lebanon the same day as they tried to make their
way to Israel, the army said.
   A paratrooper identified only as ``Capt. Yair,'' told Israel
radio the guerrillas killed today apparently were trying to use the
cover of stormy weather, rain and fog to infiltrate Israel.
   ``They come in any weather. This kind of weather makes it harder
for us, and they assume they can take advantage of it,'' he said.
``Now the problem is when the next attempt will come.''
   Troops found machine guns and ammunition with the guerrillas and
wire cutters they apparently planned to use to cut the border fence,
the army spokesman said.
   Israel carved out its security zone, a six-to-10-mile wide buffer
strip in southern Lebanon, in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its
troops from Lebaon. It is jointly patrolled by Israeli soldiers and
the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
last month endorsed a 1985 declaration by the PLO that it would
restrict its attacks to military targets inside Israel and the
occupied territories.
   The front, along with other factions in the PLO, approved that.
But it has made no comment on Arafat's later declaration renouncing
terrorism.
   The United States has said it will break off the talks with the
PLO if the movement is found to be implicated in terrorist attacks.
   Several dissident Syrian-backed Palestinian factions, who are not
members of the PLO, have denounced Arafat's declaration as a
betrayal of the Palestinian cause and vowed to continue the ``armed
struggle'' against Israel.

   Six people pleaded innocent to charges that
they made and distributed a powerful synthetic heroin that killed at
least 18 people, but a seventh has pleaded guilty, saying he wished
to ``make some atonement.''
   Donald P. Sunkin pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges of conspiracy
and drug trafficking before U.S. District Judge Donald E. Ziegler.
Sentencing was scheduled for March 1. He has agreed to cooperate
with prosecutors.
   The synthetic heroin, known as China White, has been blamed for
at least 18 overdose deaths in the Pittsburgh area, according to
Allegheny County Coroner Joshua Perper.
   Sunkin, 39, of Springdale said he asked a friend, Calgon Corp.
chemist Thomas L. Schaefers, to make the drug because he was having
difficulty financing his heroin habit. Schaefers was one of those
who pleaded innocent Tuesday.
   Sunkin said he had no idea the drug, whose chemical name is
3-methylfentanyl, would later gain wide distribution and cause the
deaths of some users.
   Sunkin agreed to help government prosecutors as part of an pact
that allows him to avoid prosecution on other charges. He still
faces a possible maximum sentence of 20 years on each of three
counts.
   Schaefers, 48, of Aspinwall; Brenda Ragland Smith, 40, of
Bellevue; Richard Williams, 32, and Mary K. McNally, 28, both
formerly of Harmar Township; and John Hricak, 42, of Bellevue
pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges they made and distributed the
drug.
   Co-defendant Donald J. Hurley, 31, of Bellevue pleaded innocent
last week.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian
teen-ager and four Arabs were reported wounded today in clashes in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip during a general strike that shut most
businesses and schools.
   Police used tear gas to disperse stone-throwers in Arab east
Jerusalem, and the police spokesman's office said three Palestinians
were detained.
   In Gaza, the army clamped a curfew on four refugee camps,
confining 150,000 Arabs to their homes.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, 18-year-old Samir Shehadah was
shot to death during a clash with troops, Arab reports said.
Military sources who declined to be further identified confirmed the
death and said it occurred during a ``violent clash'' in the city's
central market area.
   Three Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire in the nearby
town of Tulkarem, Arab hospital officials said. A 13-year-old boy
was shot and wounded in a stone-throwing clash in the Bureij refugee
camp near Gaza City, hospital officials and reporters said.
   The army said it was investigating the reports.
   Shehadah was the second Palestinian killed in as many days, and
his death raised to at least 338 the number of Palestinians killed
since the rebellion against Israeli rule began in the occupied
territories on Dec. 8, 1987. Fourteen Israelis also have died.
   High school girls took to the streets today in Nablus, marching
around the center of town chanting, ``With our blood and soul, we
will revenge our Palestinian martyrs,'' an Arab reporter said.
   At the entrance to the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Israeli
soldiers used computerized lists of tax evaders to stop local cars
and confiscate vehicles whose drivers owed back taxes, an Arab
reporter said. The soldiers told drivers the cars would be returned
on payment of back taxes.
   Palestinians have waged a tax boycott as part of their uprising
against Israeli's 21-year occupation.
   Officials at nearby Ramallah Hospital reported that 25-year-old
villager Mohammed Omar Ahmed Khalil died of gunshot wounds received
Tuesday.
   The army said it learned of the death through hospital reports
but was having trouble determining the circumstances because
relatives took Khalil's body from the hospital.
   The army customarily takes the bodies of Palestinians killed in
the uprising to perform an autopsy and usually orders the family to
conduct a quiet burial to avoid nationalist protests. Palestinians
oppose the practice and try to bring a ``shahid'' (martyr) to an
immediate burial.

   A crowd clashed with police in
a black township and seven men were found shot to death shortly
afterward, authorities said today.
   Police denied involvement in deaths. The shootings were part of
continuing violence between moderate and militant groups in the
black townships of Natal province.
   The latest bloodshed began Tuesday when a large group of blacks
attacked a black constable who was guarding a house in Mpumalanga
outside Hammarsdale. The home apparently belonged to a town
councilor or someone who had been attacked previously, said Col.
Steve van Rooyen, a police spokesman.
   Someone from the crowd fired a shotgun, wounding the constable in
the hand, police said. Other officers heard the shot and ran to his
aid, firing shotguns at the attacking crowd, van Rooyen said.
   He said the crowd scattered and shots were heard almost
immediately from 350 yards away. He said police found the bodies of
seven men in a street.
   ``The seven were shot by someone other than police,'' van Rooyen
said. the street. He said the seven men were unidentified.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed in the past year in Natal
townships, where black factions are fighting for control.
   One faction, Inkatha, is led by Zulu political leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, and others are supporters of the outlawed United
Democratic Front.
   The front opposes black participation in local government and
supports strikes and sanctions to oppose South Africa's system of
racial apartheid. Many Zulus reject those anti-apartheid measures.
   The United Democratic Front accuses police of siding with Inkatha.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   A judge ordered a 60-year-old Turkish
immigrant to be transferred to Georgia to face charges that he
helped a U.S. soldier sell intelligence secrets to East bloc
countries.
   Huseyin Yildirim of Belleair was ordered detained and sent to
Savannah, Ga., after a 90-minute hearing Tuesday. U.S. Magistrate
Paul Game Jr. set no date for his transfer by U.S. marshals.
   Yildirim, who is a U.S. citizen, is accused of plotting with
Warrant Officer James William Hall, a U.S. Army intelligence
analyst, to sell sensitive U.S. defense information to East Germany
and the Soviet Union.
   Defense attorney Arthur Addess denied the allegations, saying
Hall was lying about Yildirim to save himself.
   Hall had top-secret clearance at Fort Stewart, Ga., at the time
of his arrest last week. He appeared Tuesday at Fort Meade, Md.,
before an Army magistrate, Lt. Col. William Ramsey, who found the
Army had probable cause to detain Hall for a maximum of 30 days,
during which time charges may be filed.
   In Tampa, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Jackowski described
Yildirim as a ``courier and paymaster'' who copied and passed
classified defense documents to the East Germans, collected the
payments and returned the cash to Hall.
   A federal agent testified that Yildirim and Hall met at a U.S.
base in West Berlin, where Yildirim was an auto mechanic and Hall
was involved in electronic eavesdropping.
   The arrests followed a meeting at a Savannah hotel last week
between Hall and an FBI agent posing as a Soviet intelligence
officer, FBI agent Jeffrey Stachell testified Tuesday.
   Hall told the unidentified agent that he had been passing highly
sensitive signal intelligence documents to Soviet and East German
intelligence services since late 1982, according to an FBI arrest
affidavit.
   ``Hall boasted of the important signal intelligence information
he had passed, and admitted his motivation to be greed,'' the
affidavit said.
   Army officials began investigating last summer after being tipped
that Hall was living above his armed services salary of $20,200.

<TEXT>
   The presidency has granted amnesties
to 25 political prisoners in a move it says clears the jails of all
people charged with disseminating anti-government propaganda,
official media said today.
   The decree, announced late Tuesday on Belgrade television,
ordered the release of people jailed under Article 133 of the
Yugoslav penal code, which provides for sentences of up to five
years for anti-government propaganda.
   Communist Yugoslavia is ruled by a nine-member collective
presidency that represents its six republics, two autonomous
provinces and the army. The current president is Raif Dizdarevic.
   There have been repeated calls from lawyers, activists and the
press for Article 133 to be repealed.
   Under the decree issued by the presidency, 25 prisoners have been
released from jail, the official Tanjug news agency reported. It
also said the ``convictions'' of two others were commuted to
``bail,'' but did not say what sentences they received or whether
they had been jailed.
   Other legal measures to control anti-government activity remain
in force. They include sentences of up to 60 days for public
comments or songs deemed hostile to the communist leadership or to
Yugoslavia's official doctrine of equality among its different
ethnic groups.
   Also still in force are measures under which an estimated 500
ethnic Albanians are serving jail sentences on charges of fomenting
unrest while fighting for the rights of their minority group.
   The Albanians, who are a majority in the southern province of
Kosovo, claim they are being discriminated against by the Slavs who
control the government in Belgrade.
   On Tuesday, a military court in the central city of Sarajevo
convicted two ethnic Albanian soldiers on charges of being members
of a terrorist group that had planned to stage violent acts in army
barracks. The two were sentenced to prison terms of 5{ years and 2{
years in jail, respectively.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. District Court judge ordered eight federal
agencies to provide documents related to the 1981 murders of two
Filipino immigrants who were critics of then-Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   Judge Barbara Rothstein ordered the agencies to turn over, before
Jan. 12, all documents pertaining to Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes,
who were gunned down in the Seattle offices of the Alaska Cannery
Workers Union, where they were officials.
   The order comes in a civil suit filed by the families of Domingo
and Viernes. The suit alleges the murders were committed by agents
of Marcos in order to stop anti-Marcos activities by Viernes and
Domingo.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are among defendants named in the
suit. They were dismissed as defendants in the case in 1982, but
reinstated by Rothstein in 1987.
   The suit also alleges wrongful death, conspiracy, and assault and
battery in connection with the deaths.
   The federal agencies ordered to provide documents are the
Department of Justice, the State Department, the FBI, the National
Security Council, the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the
Naval Intelligence Service and the Naval Investigative Service-Naval
Security Command.
   The agencies had sought a protective order preventing disclosure
of the documents. But Rothstein, in a ruling late last week, ordered
the government to turn over all documents except those for which it
sought to assert a ``state secrets'' privilege.
   Other defendants in the suit include the three men convicted in
the shootings, former union leader Tony Baruso, the Philippine
government and Dr. Leonilo Malabed, a San Francisco-area doctor who
plaintiffs contend controlled a ``slush fund'' that paid for the
killings.
   The group that filed the lawsuit, the Committee for Justice for
Domingo and Viernes, claims an FBI informant was present at the
scene of the murders; that U.S. intelligence reports indicate
Viernes carried a large sum of money to aid anti-Marcos activities
in the Philippines; and that Baruso was in contact with the State
Department and other U.S. agencies within hours of the murders.
   Prosecutors contended during the murder trial of the three men
that the slayings were committed by a gang that had operated a
gambling ring in the union.
   Marcos and his wife have given depositions in the lawsuit from
their home in Hawaii. Marcos cited the Fifth Amendment protection
against self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions about the
alleged slush fund.

<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 Chinese youths, some
yelling ``blood for blood,'' gathered in central Nanking today in
the fourth straight day of anti-black demonstrations.
   Hundreds of helmeted riot police carrying truncheons hit
demonstrators and shoved others into police vans as the youths
surged onto the street of the circular intersection adjacent to the
Gulou (Drum Tower) monument.
   Meanwhile, the last American to remain with African students
forced into hiding by the angry mobs said the Africans are
determined not to return to their schools in the eastern China city.
   ``Absolutely no one wants to go back,'' Heather McMillen of
Portland, Ore., said of the 140 black African students who have been
held incommunicado in a suburban Nanking hotel since Monday.
   The Chinese youths, in a repeat of a Tuesday night rally, began
gathering about 6:30 p.m. They shouted slogans such as ``blood for
blood'' and ``support the law,'' but did not cast racial aspersions
on blacks as was done in demonstrations Sunday and Monday.
   In the earlier dermonstrations, the Chinese youths carried
banners and chanted such sayings as ``Kill the black devils'' and
``Black devils, go home.''
   ``We want our government to support the law. We want the black
students to face the law in China,'' one 18-year-old male student
from Nanking University told The Associated Press.
   A police loudspeaker at the intersection ordered the young people
to leave the area, saying their activities were ``destroying peace
and affecting the unity of the people.''
   The students have defied warnings from Nanking authorities that
all unauthorized demonstrations are illegal.
   Students said some of their companions were also taken away in
police vans Tuesday night, but most were released hours later.
   Gates at several of Nanking's main universities were locked and
guarded by police in an apparent attempt to keep students off the
street.
   Chinese officials say there have been no arrests of either
Africans or Chinese since the trouble began Saturday.
   China's worst outbreak of racial violence in years was triggered
by a Christmas Eve fight between Chinese guards at Hehai University
and African students who refused to register their Chinese
girlfriends they were taking to a party on the campus.
   Thousands of Chinese students, learning that 11 Chinese had been
injured in the brawl, smashed windows at the Africans' dormitory and
marched on other universities demanding that African students be
punished.
   Miss McMillen said she and one Japanese woman returned to Nanking
late today, a day after five other Americans who accompanied the
besieged Africans returned to their schools. About 20 non-Africans,
including students from Asia and Europe, remain with the group.
   The Africans, who fled to the railway station Sunday in an
attempt to board trains from Beijing, on Monday were forced by
police to board buses for the hotel about two hours outside the city.
   Miss McMillen, who was helping serve food and water to the
Africans at the railway station when she too was pulled onto a bus,
said the students were unable to contact their embassies or make
outside calls from the hotel.
   She said 10 African diplomats from Beijing met the students
Tuesday night. No decisions were made at the meeting, she said, but
the diplomats were sympathetic with the students' desire to leave
the city and said they would help them reach their embassies in
Beijing.
   Miss McMillen, citing incidents related to her by other foreign
students, said the anti-black demonstrations have also at times
taken on a more general anti-foreign tinge.
   Several European women students, she said, had rocks thrown at
them, and a white American at Nanjing University said Chinese youth
had shouted ``go home'' at him. ``I don't feel comfortable walking
outside,'' said Miss McMillen, a tourist who has been visiting
friends in Nanking.
   In the past 10 years the Chinese government has pushed an
open-door policy of encouraging the infusion of Western technology
and learning, but closer contacts with foreigners, whose living
conditions are usually far better than those of Chinese, has bred
resentment.

<HEAD>Homeless Evicted From One HUD House, Move Into Another</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Duwayne in 3rd graf is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hours after three homeless people were evicted
from one boarded-up house owned by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development, they moved into another unoccupied HUD house,
officials said.
   The three are members of the Union for the Homeless, and HUD
spokesman Ken Barnard accused them of seeking publicity.
   Police evicted Clotilde Lewis, 36, Duwayne Jackson, 39, and
Floretta Logan, 27, from the first house Tuesday afternoon. Homeless
Union members had helped them break into the home on Saturday. Lewis
was handcuffed and taken to a police station when she refused to
leave the first house but was released without being charged.
   Barnard said the three were trespassing in a house bought by a
family that planned to move in later in the week.
   Hours after their eviction, the three settled into a boarded-up
four-bedroom house with three kerosene heaters, clothes and
hamburgers from a fast-food restaurant.
   They remained there early today while officials considered
whether to arrest them and file trespassing charges, said William
Harris, deputy director of the Detroit HUD office.
   Wayne Pippin, president of the Union for the Homeless, said after
the eviction Tuesday that HUD owns many vacant homes and ``should be
ashamed to kick someone out of this home, which is needed so badly.''
   Jackson, unemployed after working at odd jobs, said housing is
difficult to find on $150 a month from public assistance.
   ``This is a major emergency situation,'' said Sally Pattee, a
group spokeswoman. ``The temporary shelters have been full since
July. When people need temporary shelter, they need it now.''
   Barnard said HUD makes its properties available to the homeless
through organizations such as the Detroit Non-profit Housing
Coalition. HUD obtains houses when buyers default on
government-backed mortgages.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people flooded the streets
today to protest government-ordered price increases, and Sudan's
largest trade union announced a nationwide strike.
   The strike by the 2 million-member Sudan Workers' Trade Union
Federation is to begin Thursday. Leaders vowed to keep workers off
their jobs until prices are rolled back.
   Similar labor activism in March 1985 so weakened the
authoritarian government of President Gaafar Nimeiri that a junta
led by his defense minister ousted him on April 5, 1985.
   Participants in the current demonstrations, mostly workers and
students, are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Sadek
Mahdi's elected civilian government.
   Witnesses said demonstrators chanting anti-government slogans
took to the streets this morning for a second straight day of
protests against price increases. Groups ranging from a few hundred
people to more than 1,000 rallied in several districts of Khartoum.
   Tuesday night, after an estimated 5,000 demonstrators held
protests, the leadership of Mahdi's Umma Party met and asked the
government to roll back the sharp price increases. The Umma leads a
multiparty coalition.
   On Monday, Mahdi's government increased the price of sugar by 600
percent and cigarettes by 50 percent. It also levied a 15 percent
sales tax on all locally manufactured commodities.
   The price increases came two days after the government increased
wages of public and private workers by 50 percent to 500 percent,
effective Dec. 1.
   Omar Nur Dayem, the finance minister, said Tuesday the price
increases were designed to raise more than $262 million to finance
employee salary raises and government subsidies.
   In calling for the general strike, the trade union federation's
general secretary, Mahjoub az-Zubair, charged that the government
had reneged on commitments it had made to Sudanese labor.
   He announced that the federation had sent a memorandum to Mahdi's
Cabinet demanding that it ``immediately cancel the new prices,
especially the inordinate rise in the sugar prices and other taxes.''
   The memorandum described the price raises as ``unprecedented in
the history of Sudan'' and said the salary increases were supposed
to have been effective last July 1 for both public and private
employees.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was no trace today of two French
girls reportedly freed after being held by a Palestinian terrorist
group for 13 months.
   Walid Khaled, spokesman for Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, said Monday that the girls, Marie-Laure Betille, 7, and her
sister Virginie, 6, were on their way to Paris by plane. But they
never arrived in the French capital.
   In west Beirut today an official of the organization said:
``Comrade Walid Khaled revealed the latest information on the two
French girls yesterday. There is nothing new on them.
   ``Comrade Walid Khaled is not in town and cannot be reached,''
said the official, who identified himself only as Izzat.
   Khaled said Dec. 24 that the girls would be released within 24
hours in response to a call by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi,
the group's main financial backer.
   On Sunday, Khaled said the girls were to be released ``outside
Lebanon,'' but refused to say where.
   On Tuesday, he announced that Abu Nidal had met the girls at one
of the faction's bases in Lebanon, said goodbye to them and approved
arrangements to send them home. He refused to say when the meeting
took place.
   The girls were seized by Abu Nidal's gunmen aboard a yacht off
the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip in November 1987. Also seized were
five Belgians and the girls' mother, Jacqueline Valente, who is
separated from their father, Pascal Betille.
   An informed Palestinian source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Khaled was ``intentionally making conflicting
statements about the girls to divert attention from the real
location where they will be set free.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if they surface in an Arab capital in
North Africa,'' the source said. He refused to elaborate.
   Algeria said in January it was prepared to host the release
operation.
   Khaled said when the Europeans were seized that they were spying
for Israel. But Israeli press reports said the yacht was hijacked
while sailing off the Libyan coast.
   Lebanese security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
believe that the captives have been held in Libya all the time.
   Ms. Valente, who was pregnant when the yacht was seized, gave
birth to a baby girl in captivity early this year. She has been
reported pregnant, apparently by one of the Belgian men held
captive, and to be expecting another baby early next year.
   Fifteen other foreigners are being held hostage in Lebanon,
including nine Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was abducted
March 16, 1985.

   Jazz great Cab Calloway, one of the
last of the great swing-band musicians, flew home after collapsing
during a show in Tokyo and underwent surgery here early today.
   Wendy Serkin, a spokeswoman at White Plains Hospital, would give
no details on the nature of the surgery. She said Calloway was in
``stable but critical'' condition in the recovery room and added
that the ``critical'' designation was routinely applied after such
an operation.
   The ``King of Hi-de-ho,'' who turned 81 on Christmas Day,
collapsed from exhaustion during intermission at a Dec. 21 show and
was taken to Tokyo Hospital, said his spokesman, Stan Scottland, who
was with him in Japan at the time.
   After being treated there for a week, Calloway flew to White
Plains on Tuesday ``to be near his home,'' Scottland said.
   He was admitted to White Plains Hospital around midnight, said
nursing supervisor Alice Williams.
   Calloway, who had been on a world tour, has canceled all
subsequent engagements.
   ``This is the first time ever that he has missed a performance
and the first time he has canceled a show,'' Scottland said.
``Obviously, I'm worried.''
   Calloway's famous ``Hi-de-ho'' refrains was from the 1931 hit
``Minnie the Moocher,'' which he wrote with Irving Mills. Calloway
sang it in the 1932 film ``The Big Broadcast,'' and thrilled a new
generation with his rendition of it in the 1980 film ``The Blues
Brothers,'' starring Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi.
   Calloway had his first shot at fame in the revue ``Hot
Chocolates'' in 1929, but didn't achieve it until he fronted a hot
band at Harlem's legendary Cotton Club in 1931.

<HEAD>Feds Investigate 1984 Theft of $100,000 for Link to DEA Drug
Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors investigating drug
corruption at a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office are
looking into the 1984 disappearance of nearly $100,000 from a safe
for a possible connection, according to a published report today.
   The cash disappeared from either a money vault or a cashier's
safe in July 1984, but the disappearance hasn't been linked to the
three former DEA agents who are the focus of the federal
investigation, the Los Angeles Times said today.
   The story, citing unidentified sources, said the theft of $99,950
came just three months before the suspected theft of 2{ pounds of
Asian heroin from the drug agency's evidence vault. Investigators
disclosed last week that more than 5 pounds of heroin worth an
estimated $7.5 million was missing from the agency's evidence vault.
   Three ex-DEA agents, John Jackson, Darnell Garcia and Wayne
Countryman, were indicted Dec. 7 on tax charges in connection with
an alleged conspiracy to launder $608,000 through Swiss banks.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joyce Karlin has said additional charges
of cocaine trafficking may be filed early next year.
   Federal prosecutors are considering filing charges against
Jackson and possibly Garcia in connection with the suspected heroin
thefts, the Times reported.
   ``The circumstances are being looked at now in connection with
the ongoing investigation of these agents,'' said John Zienter, head
of the Los Angeles office since 1987.
   Donald Hugh, a retired DEA agent and assistant evidence custodian
who first disclosed the money's disappearance, blamed lax procedures
in the handling of both drugs and money. The poor standards were in
place much of the decade, he said.
   ``The evidence vault was like a meeting place for agents,'' Hugh
said. ``There used to be three and four guys in there at a time,
milling around. It was hard to keep track of them. They didn't
change things until fairly recently.''
   Zienter said the evidence vault now is off-limits to agents.
   Jackson, 39, of Claremont is being held in federal custody
without bail. Countryman, 45, of Walnut is free on $120,000 bail and
Garcia, 42, is a fugitive.

   Under brilliant blue skies and cooler
temperatures President-elect Bush continued for the third day today
to hunt quail, according to a spokesman.
   Bush was out of the public's sight on the Lazy F Ranch, but the
White House released a picture of him Tuesday in his hunting garb.
   The photo showed Bush dressed in a teal shirt, red sweater, cap
and camouflage coveralls. He carried his shotgun.
   Bush's cap bore the insignia of B or M Kennels, which provided
the dogs to flush out the quail, aides said.
   Steve Hart, Bush's spokesman, said the vice president was
successful, but he did not know how many birds Bush had killed.
   ``He didn't strike out,'' Hart said.
   Conditions have been less than perfect for quail hunting this
year, local residents say, in part because of the drought, which
killed some birds. Tuesday's temperatures in the 70s were above the
ideal level for quail hunting, and gusty winds were an impediment.
   Bush is scheduled to remain on the Lazy F today with his friends,
Will Farish, the Houston millionaire who owns the ranch, and James
A. Baker III, the designated secretary of state.
   Bush is to leave Thursday morning, flying first to Alabama for a
few hours of fishing before he returns to the nation's capital.

   A 13-year-old boy who regularly drove a
car on what authorities believe were drug runs accidentally killed
himself while putting a sawed-off shotgun into a car, police say.
   Willie J. Sasnett of Jacksonville died Christmas Eve after he was
shot in the abdomen, Police Chief Frank Owens said Tuesday. About
$28 in cash and $50 worth of crack cocaine were found on the boy's
body, police said.
   Officers said information about the youth's frequent trips from
Jacksonville to Lake City came from a larger probe into juveniles,
weapons and drugs in this north-central Florida town.
   Owens said youths have been attracted to Lake City, about 80
miles west of Jacksonville, because ``a piece of crack that would
sell for $10 anyplace else would cost $20 to $25 here. ... They're
able to make more of a profit.''
   On Christmas Day, police arrested three 16-year-olds after an
incident in which one of the boys pulled a sawed-off shotgun on two
other teen-agers. Police did not say whether the incident was
drug-related.

<HEAD>Class Graduates From Police Academy Where Cadet Died After Rigorous
Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGAWAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cadets graduating from a state police
training academy were told today that they would be accepted among
their colleagues despite the controversy surrounding the troubled
facility.
   Last fall, the death of one recruit and the hospitilization of
more than a dozen others during strict training caused an uproar and
led to an overhaul of the agency that trains police.
   Peter W. Agnes Jr., interim director of that agency, the Criminal
Justice Training Council, assured the recruits that they had not
``somehow missed out on something that other police officers had in
their training.''
   The 45 cadets receiving diplomas at the graduation ceremony at
Agawam Junior High School were five fewer than the 50 municipal
rookies who entered the police academy in Agawam on Sept. 19.
   Within a week, 13 cadets had been hospitalized from dehydration
and exhaustion, and one cadet, Timothy Shepard of Pittsfield, had
fallen unconscious from heat stroke. Shepard, 25, eventually
regained consciousness and underwent a liver transplant, but
succumbed to infections and died Nov. 3.
   ``Your experience as members of the 12th recruit class has done
more to change the methods and approach to police training in this
state than any other event since the establishment of the municipal
training council in 1964,'' Agnes said in graduation remarks.
   ``You are special because of what you have endured, and you are
special because of what you and Tim Shepard have inspired us to do
for those who will come after you,'' he said.
   The cadets' hospitalization sparked investigations by two
legislative groups and a panel of police chiefs, doctors and
exercise experts assembled by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. The
governor's report is expected within a month.
   Shepard's death also prompted an inquest to determine whether
criminal negligence charges should be brought. The inquest is in
recess in Springfield District Court.
   Shepard's family has said they want charges filed against the
cadet's trainers, who led six other troopers in directing allegedly
grueling training on the first day of the 14-week session.
   Agnes replaced Executive Director Gary Egan as head of the
training council when Egan resigned hours before Shepard died.

<TEXT>
   The following is the text of the statement released
Wednesday by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the
Department of Transport on the Dec. 21 crash of Pan Am Flight 103.
   A number of items of wreckage, passenger baggage, and part of the
framework of a metal luggage pallet are being examined by Ministry
of Defense scientists. More items have been collected by Air
Accidents Investigation Branch investigators from the accident area;
each of these will be subjected to lengthy chemical and
metallurgical forensic examinations.
   However, it has been established that two parts of the metal
luggage pallet framework show conclusive evidence of a detonating
high explosive.
   The explosive's residues recovered from the debris have been
positively identified and are consistent with the use of a high
performance plastic explosive.
   Other evidence collected by the Air Accidents Investigation
Branch, in particular that from the flight data recorder and the
cockpit voice recorder and from the wreckage trail on the ground,
has led to the preliminary conclusion that the explosion took place
soon after the aircraft had crossed the Scottish border whilst it
was in the cruise at 31,000 feet and that this led directly to its
destruction.
   Much investigative work remains to be done to establish the
nature of the explosive device, what it was contained in, its
location in the aircraft, and the sequence of events immediately
following its detonation.

   A family of five, including a child, died
in a fiery crash after a motorist fleeing police at more than 80 mph
ran a red light and slammed into their car, authorities said today.
   Tuesday night's accident was the third this month in which a
police chase ended in death.
   ``It's unfortunate. It's just unfortunate. The officers out there
have a job to do and you just never know what's around the corner,''
Detective Glenn Taylor said.
   Police said they had tentatively identified the badly burned
victims, but were withholding the names until the Franklin County
coroner could verify them. A boy was among the three males and two
females killed, Taylor said.
   A police cruiser began following the car moments before it
collided with the family's auto, authorities said.
   ``It's wasn't really a chase. The cruiser attempted to pursue,
but never really got a chance,'' said Officer Edward Combs. The
driver, Emmett Gabriel, 30, of Columbus, was being sought for
speeding, Combs said.
   Gabriel was in poor condition this morning at Grant Medical
Center where he underwent surgery for facial injuries, a fractured
wrist andng contact with a suspect but at a lower speed _ and they
discuss the ethical issues involved in high-speed chases in their
police academy classes, Carruthers said.

charged Budget Rent-A-Car Corp. with failing to disclose to
prospective renters that it failed to inspect automobiles subject to
recall notices within a reasonable period of time and make the
necessary repairs.
   The agency at the same time said it had reached a consent
agreement with Budget, which agreed to make the inspections and
repairs on a timely basis.
   Jody Wilson, a spokeswoman at Budget's corporate headquarters in
Chicago, said the company had no immediate comment on the FTC
announcement.
   According to the government's complaint, Budget rented to the
general public automobiles that were subject to recall notices.
   The company allegedly did not inspect these vehicles within a
reasonable period of time after the recall notice to determine
whether they contained safety-related defects and, where
appropriate, repair the vehicles. Budget then failed to disclose
these facts to prospective renters or purchasers of the vehicles,
the FTC said.
   Under the consent agreement, Budget will inspect and repair the
vehicles within 120 days after receiving a recall notice.
   Alternatively, if Budget chooses not to inspect, the order would
require Budget to disclose to prospective renters that the vehicles
are subject to safety recall notices and may contain defects.
   The proposed consent agreement, scheduled to appear in the
Federal Register on Jan. 3, will be subject to public comment for 60
days, after which the FTC will decide whether to make it final.
   A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not
constitute admission of a law violation.
   When the FTC issues a consent order on a final basis, it carries
the force of law with respect to future actions. Each violation of
such an order may result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the nation.

   The Daily Times, Primos, Pa., on the Pan Am crash:
   There is sorrow, anger and shock across the United States this
holiday season.
   Sorrow because scores of American servicemen, government
officials, students and tourists were among the 258 people killed in
the crash of Pan Am flight 103 ... in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Anger because the U.S. embassy in Finland received an anonymous
tip earlier this month that the Abu Nidal terrorist group would
target a Pan Am flight to the U.S.
   And shock because the U.S. government warned the airline and some
of its own personnel without telling the public.
   That outrage should be channeled in the proper direction. If
flight 103 was blown out of the sky by terrorists, they, and they
alone, are the ones at whom we should direct our anger and our
outrage.

   West Bend (Wis.) Daily News, on the congressional pay raise:
   We agree with Sen.-elect Herbert Kohl that while members of
Congress may deserve a pay hike, the 50 percent raise recommended by
a presidential commission is out of line.
   And we urge other members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation
to follow Kohl's lead and reject the increase in annual pay from
$89,500 to $135,000 even if it is approved.
   There aren't many people working in the private sector here in
West Bend who will receive 50 percent pay increases in 1989. And if
they do, it's a safe bet their performance has been monitored by a
more scientific yardstick than the elections congressmen and
senators are subjected to each two and six years, respectively.
   It is true that in order to attract the qualified people we need
in Washington, D.C., the pay must be competitive with the private
sector and also must take into consideration the high cost of living
in the nation's capital. But it's hard for most Americans to feel
sorry for someone already earning $89,500 a year.
   This proposal concerns us here in West Bend, just as all other
local, state and federal government spending concerns us. The only
way to turn deficit spending around is to adopt a more judicious
approach to the way tax dollars are allocated.

   The Philadelphia Inquirer, on the earthquake in Armenia:
   One of the most haunting elements of the Armenian earthquake is
how it perpetuates a history of suffering that is centuries old.
   Once an empire, Armenia had undergone a centuries-long series of
conquerors when it reached its nadir in the years following 1915.
One and a half million Armenians were killed or forced to flee under
murderous conditions at the hands of the Ottoman Turks.
   It is the deep-rooted fears and insecurities provoked by those
memories that has made Armenian nationalism one of the most
explosive of the ethnic problems that plague Mr. Gorbachev.
   Having experienced a staggering new blow (the earthquake) that
has united the world's Armenians ..., Armenians of the Soviet Union
are unlikely to drop their territorial cause. Mr. Gorbachev will
have to sensitize himself to the depth of these emotions ... if he
wants to prevent a political earthquake from shaking Armenia.

   The News and Observer, Raleigh, N.C., on state lotteries:
   Virginia's new state lottery has put the little town of Bracey on
the map. There's a truck stop there, off Interstate 85, just over
the line from North Carolina, that led all Virginia lottery outlets
with $387,500 in tickets sold in one recent game. Sales in other
communities near the state line were equally impressive. Much of the
money, presumably, came from North Carolinians who crossed the
border in search of a windfall. But that's no reason to yield to the
temptation to start up a Tar Heel lottery.
   Any windfall for North Carolina would be illusory. States
typically find that lotteries, instead of providing extra revenues,
eventually shift a revenue burden onto people who can ill afford it.
That's because lotteries can become a substitute for more equitable
taxes, and because they tend to appeal to people who have the least
to start with. It's easy for those people to forget that most
lottery players are losers, not winners.
   As is usually true when a scheme promises something for nothing,
the reality is more like nothing for something. In the case of a
lottery, it's likely to be ``nothing'' in the way of dependable
revenue in exchange for the ``something'' of promoting
state-sanctioned gambling and extracting money from the poor.

   The Miami News, on the U.S. political asylum policy:
   The Asylum Policy and Review Unit (APRU) is a Justice Department
agency established to monitor decisions made by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, another Justice Department agency, but one
which behaves as if it were the only law west of the beltway. ...
   (INS Commissioner Alan) Nelson wants his word to be law and in
asking Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to expunge the APRU has
made the standard Reaganesque argument. Running the unit is too
expensive, Nelson says. He figures that in the year since APRU has
been in operation it has cost $750,000.
   That's a lot of money, but by government standards not enough to
hang an argument on. And Nelson's real objective, protecting his
authority, is transparent enough to wrap a sandwich. ...
   The APRU has been more lenient than the first-level INS examiners
in favoring asylum requests and supporting further reviews. Given
the arbitrary nature of asylum policy and its application, Attorney
General Thornburgh would be wise to treat Nelson's territorial
complaint as what it is and continue to encourage the asylum review
unit and the asylum review process.

   Seattle Post-Intelligencer, on Cabinet nominations:
   President-elect George Bush offered up a mixed bag in his
selections last week for Cabinet posts.
   Elizabeth Dole's appointment as labor secretary is an excellent
one. She was a strong transportation secretary in the Reagan
administration.
   Bush chose well in naming Dr. Louis W. Sullivan as secretary of
health and human services.
   Another outstanding appointment is that of William Kane Reilly,
president of the Conservation Foundation and the World Wildlife
Fund, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency, which is not a
Cabinet-level job.
   Former Congressman from Chicago Edward Joseph Derwinski, who
helped negotiate the Ross Dam Treaty when he served in the State
Department, is a good choice for the veterans post.
   Samuel Knox Skinner, the nominee for transportation secretary and
a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, received high marks as
chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeastern
Illinois.
   The most worrisome appointment is that of retiring Rep. Manuel
Lujan Jr. as secretary of interior. Lujan has been a supporter of
the infamous James Watt, who brough disgrace to the agency when he
headed it. Westerners striving for reasonable policies to conserve
precious resources can only hope Lujan is capable of growing wiser
in the job.

   The Daily Journal, Elizabeth, N.J., on a survey calling for
parents to supplement the teaching of their children:
   In a (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching)
survey, 90 percent of teachers said lack of parental support was a
problem in their schools.
   Realistically, little is likely to change unless teachers
themselves press for new and creative efforts on the part of the
schools to encourage _ or even require _ greater parent
participation in the education process.
   By law, parents must provide an approved education for their
children. For most parents, this means sending them to public
school. Busy trying to make tasks that have been loaded on the
schools, the parents end their involvement there.
   Simply increasing parental awareness of how teachers feel may
help. But we cannot realistically expect teaches to receive more
parental support until school programs include parents in practical
and meaningful ways that are related to the education of their own
children.

   Anderson (S.C.) Independent-Mail, on congressional pay raise:
   We wish that members of the Congress of the United States would
forego at least for this term a hefty raise for themselves.
   We have two reasons for suggesting that congressmen reject the
proposal of a presidential commission that they boost their salaries
by 50 percent from $89,500 to $135,000 annually. Both involve the
treacherous state of governmental economic affairs _ the horrible
national debt _ that hangs over every citizen of the United States.
   It would be at least a symbolic gesture of responsibility if the
Congress would say no to the increase, proclaiming by action rather
than words for once that it is seeking to save every dollar possible
in a quest to get the debt under control.
   Secondly, we don't think their performance deserves a merit
increase. They have had a lot of fun overspending other people's
money and getting re-elected as a result, but it's time the
merry-go-round stopped.
   We realize the raise must occur early in the upcoming session or
the electorate is going to have the increase on their minds when the
next election rolls around. That would be political folly.
   But rather than react in the traditional political manner, it
would be nice if our representatives and senators responded in a
responsible way.

   Austin (Texas) American-Statesman, on a Navy study's
recommendations for dealing with racial bias:
   An internal Navy report shows that minorities in that branch of
the service receive lower marks on evaluation reports and fitness
exams, fewer promotions, and are likely to hear racial slurs or
jokes. The approach taken by the chief of naval operations, to
address the problems aggressively and quickly, is the right approach
...
   The minority men and women who volunteer their service on behalf
of our government and for the cause of national security deserve to
be treated equal to their white counterparts. Knowing where the
shortcomings lie, the Navy now needs to correct them quickly.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on steroids and athletes:
   Anabolic steroids are most often associated with top-level
athletes driven to physical perfection. Sometimes, however, the
drugs entrap young boys seeking a quick way to improve athletic
prowess or to impress their friends with a muscular physique.
Schools and parents must begin to deal with this potentially abusive
behavior.
   Up to 500,000 high-school boys have taken anabolic steroids to
boost their athletic performance or improve their looks, according
to Pennslyvania State University, which conducted the first
nationwide study on the topic.
   Perhaps adolescent anabolic steroid use is a result of modern
American society's obsession with winning and looking good. If so,
the message is sobering: Teen-age boys are ingesting potentially
dangerous drugs to keep up with the impossible physical ideals
constantly thrown at them.
   One of the most disturbing aspects of this behavior is that so
little is known about how the drugs will affect adolescents'
developing bodies. This ``quick fix'' could well come back to haunt
adolescents' health later on.

   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal, on Wall Street misdeeds:
   After some two years of proclaiming its innocence, the Wall
Street brokerage house of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to
plead guilty to two felony counts and pay an extraordinary $650
million in fines and assessments. It was the second major guilty
plea in an insider trading investigation that has grown into the
biggest securities fraud scandal since the 1920s.
   Over time, strict criminal enforcement of securities laws and
regulations should build and maintain investor confidence in the
independence of the market. But for now, it is still in the
catharsis of disclosure.
   The resource allocation function of America's financial markets
is the great strength of our capitalistic system. Those caught
perverting it should not be allowed to get off lightly.

   Los Angeles Times, on Peru's President:
   ... When he was first elected in 1985, (Peru's President Alan)
Garcia was only 36. ... He seemed to represent a new generation of
leader in Peru _ eager, energetic and articulate. After winning in a
landslide, Garcia's approval rating surged as high as 96 percent in
some public-opinion polls _ largely due to his populist economic
policies and fiercely nationalistic political rhetoric.
   ... To overcome several years of economic stagnation, his
government overspent, running up a large deficit and stimulating
inflation that has run out of control _ up to an annual rate of
1,300 percent last year, the highest in South America. Garcia's
rhetoric, especially threats to stop repayment of Peru's $15 billion
foreign debt, frightened away the international bankers whom Peru
needs to keep capital flowing into the country. Today the nation ...
cannot afford to import basic foodstuffs like milk and wheat. Garcia
is widely blamed for the economic mess. One recent poll gave him an
approval rating of only 16 percent.
   ... He has also been unable to defeat a leftist insurgency
sponsored by a shadowy and violent organization known as Sendero
Luminoso (Shining Path), whose leaders claim to be the only true
heirs to the philosophy and tactics of China's Mao Tse-tung.
   ... Sendero Luminoso was spilling blood before Garcia came into
office. And Peru's economic troubles are similar to those faced by
other Latin American debtor nations. ... Peru's damaged economy and
dangerous political situation will remain as challenges to whoever
follows Garcia into Lima's presidential palace.

   Two rhinoceroses who had been

   The cow and the bull had been constant companions in recent weeks

   The rhinos' carcasses were found Sunday at the Krugersdorp Game
Reserve, northwest of Johannesburg, and were buried Monday, he told

   Richards said the Krugersdorp town council was seeking a permit
from the Department of Nature Conservation to sell the rhinos'
horns. The proceeds would be used to buy another breeding pair for
the reserve.
   Selling rhino horn is illegal because the animal is considered an
endangered species. One horn can fetch up to $40,000.

   Thousands of discarded Christmas trees this
year will be tossed into Lake Pontchartrain, gaining new life as a
brushy dike against erosion.
   ``It's a way one family can do something positive for coastal
restoration,'' said Robert Thomas, director of the Louisiana Nature
and Science Center.
   The push to recycle Christmas trees began Tuesday and will
continue through Jan. 7, the day after Epiphany, when some
Louisianians take down their Christmas trees.
   Area residents are expected to contribute as many as 7,000 trees
to build the barrier, Thomas said. Organizers also are encouraging
Christmas tree lot owners to give generously of their unsold
merchandise.
   ``So many years we had these Christmas trees left and we can't do
anything with them. So now we can do something with them,'' said lot
owner Danny Stogner, who said he is pitching in 900 trees.
   The trees will be collected at designated drop-off areas and at
the curb. Contractors hired by the state Department of Natural
Resources will dump the evergreens in the St. Charles Parish marshes
northwest of New Orleans.
   The trees will be submerged in a line to form a sill, which will
trap sediment as water washes over them. The sediment will build up
and allow plants to grow, Thomas said.
   Erosion claims as much as 60 square miles of Louisiana each year,
destroying some of the nation's most productive habitat for seafood,
waterfowl and animals with marketable pelts.
   In 1986 in St. Charles Parish, pieces of willow trees were woven
between stakes driven in the ground. In 1987, 1,500 Christmas trees
were called upon for double duty there.
   ``This year ... we're creating bigger and better fences. The ones
we have up now are working very well,'' said Gretchen Binet, parish
administrator of coastal zone management. ``We hope to do even
better this year and maybe make it an annual event.''

   As the days passed, and Gayaney's pleas for something to drink
become more pressing, her mother remembered something she had seen
on television.
   ``It was a program about an explorer in the Arctic who was dying
of thirst. His comrade slashed open his hand and gave his friend his
blood,'' she said.
   Losing track of time because of the unchanging darkness, Mrs.
Petrosyan doesn't know what day she cut open her fingers, or how
many times she used the method to feed her daughter.
   Her thoughts wandered. She saw scenes of her life pass before her
eyes, and she hallucinated.
   ``When I closed my eyes and opened them again, I could see boxes
full of apples and bottles of lemonade,'' Mrs. Petrosyan recalled.
``I told my daughter, `My child, there are so many things to eat and
drink.' But when I reached out to touch them, they were gone.''
   Gayaney cried that she wanted to go home. ``I want to be back in
my bed again, and see my daddy,'' she said.
   ``I lost all hope,'' the mother said. ``I was just waiting for
death.''
   On Dec. 14, the eighth day of their captivity, rescue workers
opened a small hole that let in a shaft of light. ``We're saved!''
Mrs. Petrosyan cried.
   ``There's a child in here, be careful not to hurt her!'' she
screamed as they got closer.
   Her husband, a shoemaker, was uninjured by the quake. He was with
the rescuers and the two tearfully embraced. Mrs. Petrosyan was
placed on a stretcher.
   Mother and daughter were flown to Yerevan, Armenia's capital, 60
miles away. Gayaney was taken to Children's Hospital No. 3, Mrs.
Petrosyan to the Armenian national hospital.
   Gayaney was in intensive care for four days, hooked up to
intravenous bottles that dripped liquids into her parched body.
   Her temperature was dangerously low, her blood alarmingly thick
and she was in shock, said Dr. Silva Nersesyan, her physician. The
girl also was in a deep state of depression, and wouldn't talk or
smile.
   Mrs. Petroysan, also dehydrated, was given intravenous fluids and
placed in a coffin-like box so that pressurized oxygen could be
pumped around her as a treatment against exposure.
   It was then that doctors discovered that the woman, who also has
a 7-year-old son who was not hurt in the earthquake, is two months'
pregnant.
   Doctors say both mother and daughter could be released from their
hospitals in as little as a week, but differ about whether Mrs.
Petrosyan's blood helped keep Gayaney alive.
   ``For a child, the concentration of liquids in the body is much
more important than for an adult,'' Nersesyan said. ``For Gayaney,
her mother's blood played an important, perhaps decisive role.''
   Dr. Ripsime Parsadanyan, who treated Mrs. Petrosyan, disagrees.
``Susanna lost a very little, even insignificant amount of blood.
What saved them was that they were together. The mother didn't have
time to panic. She had to think of her child.''
   Gayaney is still weak and has a light case of pneumonia. But the
girl with the big, dark eyes has started to talk again and to smile.
   In her hospital bed, she strings colored yarn through cardboard
dolls and plays with a teddy bear _ Christmas gifts that Jeb Bush,
the son of President-elect George Bush, gave her when he visited the
hospital Sunday.
   Gayaney is too young to understand what happened to her the day
she was buried alive.
   ``Bad people pulled down the house where we were, and we couldn't
get out,'' she said. ``I wanted my father to come and defend us from
those bad people. But he didn't come. Not for a long time.''

   Women wailed alongside Dhaleswari
River that swirled over a sunken ship Wednesday, and Afazuddin Ahmed
fell to his knees on the sandy bank, sharing his grief with
thousands.
   Ahmed had rushed to this little river town when he heard that a
ferry with an estimated 250 people aboard _ including his family _
had sunk just off shore Tuesday.
   Survivors and witnesses said no more than 100 passengers survived
the tragedy. Only five bodies have been found, but authorities
believe many more are inside the vessel's submerged hull.
   Ahmed found his 4-year-old daughter wandering among the
grief-stricken crowd of survivors and relatives, but his 22-year-old
wife and three other young daughters were missing.
   The family was headed to visit his father-in-law, and Ahmed, who
had stayed behind to farm, would have joined them Thursday.
   ``Oh, Allah, what have I done to you that I should be punished
this way?'' the 30-year-old farmer cried, joining a cacophony of
sorrow and confusion. ``I must die, why should I live? What should I
live for?''
   An estimated 5,000 people, most of them relatives, crowded this
little village on the western bank of the river Wednesday while
searchers looked for survivors from Tuesday's sinking.
   The ferry, a single-deck motor launch called the Shasayal, sank
after colliding with a cargo vessel.
   The 74-feet wooden ship was under 21 feet of water as rescuers
awaited the arrival of a salvage ship from the southern port town of
Mongla. The ship is not expected before Thursday.
   Witnesses and passengers said the ferry had a sanctioned capacity
of only 168 people.
   ``Only those traveling on the upper deck of the ferry could
survive,'' said Mohammad Ali, a Dhaka businessman who swam ashore.
   ``It is unlikely that there is anyone alive inside the hull. More
bodies are likely to be found inside the hull,'' said Chowdhury
Mohammad Azad, director of Bangladesh's shipping department.
   Police and other government officials would not comment on the
death toll or the number missing. A police officer speaking on
condition of anonymity would only say five bodies were found.
   Ferries are a popular form of transportation in Bangladesh and
accidents are relatively common, but death tolls are difficult to
estimate. Government officials often refuse to confirm witness
accounts of dead or missing.
   Some villagers hurled stones at police and rescue officials,
accusing them of slowing the rescue operation to cover up the number
of casualties. The police quieted the crowd with mild baton charges.
   Abul Kalam was traveling to Dhaka from the village of Hasail,
where the ferry's journey started. He said his four children were
lost in the sinking.
   The family was returning to their Dhaka home after a week-long
visit to Kalam's father-in-law's house at Hasail, only seven miles
south of Dhaka.
   ``I am afraid I shall never get my children back. What shall I
tell to their mother?'' he said, bursting into tears.

   A 64-year-old industrialist was kidnapped
outside his home in the southern Apulia region Wednesday,
authorities said.
   Marzio Perrini, head of a company that manufactures wood
products, was seized about 6 a.m. as he was getting into his car to
drive to work near this port city.
   Perrini's wife, who said she saw another car driving off at high
speed, rushed outside and found one of her husband's shoes and his
broken eyeglasses near his car. Police set up roadblocks in the area
but found no immediate traces of Perrini or the kidnappers.
   It was the 17th reported kidnapping in Italy this year, and five
of the victims are still missing.

   Dry weather continues to be a problem for the
1989 winter wheat crop in much of the southern Great Plains, a
government report said Wednesday.
   ``Winter wheat fields in Kansas continued to show signs of
moisture stress,'' the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said.
``Greenbug infestation was a continuing problem.''
   Texas farmers have been spraying to control the greenbugs, and
much of the winter wheat crop in the state also is hurting from lack
of moisture.
   In Colorado, the wheat crop was in ``mostly good'' condition
during the week of Dec. 19-25, but more snow cover was needed, the
report said. Montana's winter wheat was reported in ``mostly fair to
good'' shape, and the Oregon crop was said to be in ``mostly good''
condition, although Russian wheat aphids continued to be a problem
in the eastern part of the state.
   The farm weather facility is operated by the Agriculture and
Commerce departments.

   A man charged with stabbing to death his

   But black magic didn't spare him from being convicted and

   Ruben Andujar, 46, was convicted of murder Dec. 22 in the 1987
slaying of Angelina Colon, 29. The jury sentenced him on Tuesday.
   Andujar paid $200 each for the curses on Assistant District

investigated the stabbing, Cameron said.
   ``It was a cheap curse,'' Cameron said. ``I hear a good curse
goes in the neighborhood of $10,000.''
   Cameron said a member of the victim's family reported the curses
to authorities. Andujar allegedly had a relative take the money to
the spell-caster.

   A bomb blew up Pan Am Flight 103 with
259 people aboard as the jumbo jet flew over Scotland a week ago,
the Department of Transport announced today.
   Investigators found ``conclusive evidence of a detonating high
explosive'' in wreckage recovered from the Scottish countryside.
   It said the evidence was found on ``two parts of the metal
luggage pallet framework'' _ a metal luggage container.
   ``The explosive's residues recovered from the debris have been
positively identified and are consistent with the use of a
high-performance plastic explosive,'' the statement said.
   The statement gave no further information on the type of
explosive, nor did it say where it was hidden or how it got aboard
the aircraft. It also did not speculate on who was responsible for
the bombing or a possible motive.
   In Washington, the State Department pledged a ``vigorous
investigation'' would be carried out by the FBI and other U.S.
government offices.
   ``We are doing everything possible and using all available
resources and sources to find out who did it,'' spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said. ``We are determined to get to the bottom of this and
find out who did it.''
   ``This operation has developed into a criminal inquiry of
international dimensions,'' said John Boyd, chief constable of the
area in Scotland where the crash occurred.
   The Transport Ministry statement was distributed to news
organizations in London and read to reporters in Lockerbie by
Michael Charles, head of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of
the Transport Ministry. Charles declined to answer reporters'
questions after reading the statement.
   Lockerbie bore the brunt of the Boeing 747's flaming wreckage
when it fell out of the sky on Dec. 21.
   The statement said evidence collected by the branch, including
the cockpit voice and flight data recorders and the trail of
wreckage on the ground, ``has led to the preliminary conclusion that
the explosion took place soon after the aircraft had crossed the
Scottish border whilst it was in the cruise at 31,000 feet and that
this led directly to its destruction.''
   ``Much investigative work remains to be done to establish the
nature of the explosive device, what it was contained in, its
location in the aircraft, and the sequence of events immediately
following its detonation,'' the statement said.
   It said wreckage, baggage and part of the framework of a metal
luggage pallet were being examined by Ministry of Defense
scientists, while more items have been collected by Air Accidents
Investigation Branch investigators ``will be subjected to lengthy
chemical and metallurgical forensic examinations.''
   Earlier today, news reports in Britain said that heat damage to
the plastic lining of a cargo bay and metal slivers found embedded
in the bodies of passengers indicated that a bomb downed the jet.
   In London, meanwhile, pine coffins containing the first bodies of
Americans killed in the Dec. 21 crash arrived at Heathrow Airport
and were loaded onto two separate Pan Am flights bound for New York.
   In Scotland, authorities said they had formally identified two
more victims: Michael Joseph Doyle, 30, of Voorhees, N.J., and Sean
Concannon, 16, of Banbury, England.
   On Tuesday night, residents paid silent respects to the five
American victims of the jumbo jet disaster whose bodies were the
first to leave this Scottish town since the New York-bound Boeing
747 fell onto it in pieces.
   All 259 people aboard were killed, and 11 missing townspeople are
presumed dead. Police spokesman Angus Kennedy said one more body was
recovered Tuesday, bringing the total to 241.
   More than 600 rescuers, including 15 divers, 30 tracker dogs and
100 soldiers, today resumed their search of the woods and icy waters
in a 100-square-mile area of southwestern Scotland for the missing
victims and wreckage, which included one of the plane's wings.
   Also today, four men arrested for allegedly looting the wreckage
were scheduled to appear in a local court.
   The Times report today gave details of evidence pointing to a
bomb. It quoted unidentified investigators as saying they found heat
damage on parts of a cargo bay's plastic lining, caused most
probably by an explosion among luggage.
   ``One (investigator) indicated that the cargo bay lining was the
most significant find,'' the newspaper said. ``It is made of kevlar,
an extremely strong but lightweight polymer compound ideally suited
to aircraft construction.''
   Michael Yardley, a terrorism expert and author, told the domestic
news agency Press Association that the bomb likely was ``a large
device, probably 10 to 20 kilos (22 to 44 pounds) of a plastic
explosive like Semtex.'' Yardley is not involved in the
investigation.
   Semtex is a Czechoslovakian-made plastic explosive that is
lightweight, odorless and hard to detect. Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi is believed to have obtained large quantities of Semtex,
which is used for military and industrial purposes.
   The town's tribute on Tuesday to the dead appeared to be
spontaneous. Reporters, who are briefed two or three times daily in
Lockerbie, had only about a half-hour notice of the move.
   The convoy for the coffins began at a warehouse, now pressed into
use as a chapel of rest. An honor guard included police, mountain
rescue teams with their dogs, local officials, and Pan Am flight
attendants.
   As a police motorcycle led the big white refrigerator van past
the town hall, the crowd surged forward.
   Some women wept, and others bowed their heads as the van rolled
slowly by. One man saluted and another raised his hand in a gesture
of parting.
   The only sound on High Street, as the main street is known, was a
squeaky axle on the trailer.
   Residents stood silently for a couple minutes, then melted into
the night. A cold rain began to fall.
   Kennedy, the local police spokesman, said it was not known when
the next bodies would depart, but the pace is expected to accelerate
in coming days.
   He identified the five Americans as Kenneth Raymond Garczynski,
37, of North Brunswick, N.J.; Om Dixit, 55, of Fairborn, Ohio; his
wife, Shanti Dixit, 53; and their two grandchildren, Suruchi Rattan,
3, and her 2-year-old brother Anmol, of Warren, Mich. The children's
mother, Garima, 29, was also aboard the plane but her body
apparently has not been identified.

<HEAD>Vietnam Says Cambodia Peace Talks Should Go Ahead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam has urged Indonesia to hold a
second round of multilateral peace talks scheduled for February,
even if Cambodian guerrillas refuse to attend, official Radio Hanoi
said.
   Vice Foreign Minister Tran Quang Co made Vietnam's position known
to Indonesian Ambassador Aswis Marmo in a Hanoi meeting Tuesday, it
said. A text of Tuesday's broadcast was seen in Bangkok on Wednesday.
   ``They (guerrillas) can only contribute to solving the internal
aspect of the Cambodian issue. They cannot prevent the settlement of
the international aspect of the Cambodian issue and the question of
Southeast Asian peace and stability,'' the radio quoted Co as saying.
   The talks are designed to bring together Vietnam, its ally, Laos,
the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia, and Cambodia's
three guerrilla groups and their supporters in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations. The first round was held in Indonesia in
July.
   The guerrillas are fighting a largely stalemated war against
Vietnamese forces that invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day 1978.
   Guerrilla leaders Dec. 21 said the talks should be postponed
because the other side showed no flexibility.
   Rebel leader Son Sann of the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front on Wednesday said the guerrillas requested a postponement
because of the failure of working group discussions in Paris this
month.
   In an interview broadcast by rebel radio, Son Sann described as
``useless'' the meeting between the guerrillas' allies, including
Khieu Samphan of the communist Khmer Rouge and Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, and Cambodian President Hun Sen's representative, Hor Nam
Hong.
   ``Hor Nam Hong remained intransigent, refusing to be flexible or
to accept any point of the five-point final proposal,'' Son Sann
said.
   The proposal calls for Hun Sen to dismantle his government _ a
condition the Cambodian leader rejects.

   Inspections an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727s found a
fuselage crack in a jet in ``roughly the same area'' where a 14-inch
hole tore open in another plane, forcing an emergency landing, the
airline said today.
   Eastern officials in Boston said the Boeing 727 was grounded for
repairs at Logan International Airport after company inspectors
discovered the 3-inch crack in the fuselage Monday night.
   The airline ordered the inspections of its Boeing 727 fleet after
a 14-inch hole tore open in the fuselage of an Atlanta-bound 727 on
Monday, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Charleston,
W.Va., when its cabin depressurized.
   ``We're doing it on our own,'' spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said
from Eastern's headquarters in Miami. ``It's just as a precautionary
measure following yesterday's incident. ... We know that Eastern
Airlines is safe. We hope that professionalism will prevail.''
   No problems were found in the other planes that were inspected,
she said today.
   On Tuesday, federal officials investigating the forced landing of
Atlanta-bound Flight 251 said the plane had problems maintaining
cabin pressure shortly after takeoff from Rochester, N.Y., before
the roof ripped open.
   ``By the time they reached 31,000 feet, they were able to
stabilize the pressure,'' although the hole in the fuselage soon
developed, said National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz.
   There was no indication what caused the initial problem, he said.
   A 5-inch crack had been found on the fuselage in an inspection in
July 1986, although the plane had been cleared to fly in an
inspection as recently as September, Federal Aviation Administration
officials said.
   On orders from Eastern, mechanics spent Monday night and Tuesday
inspecting 17 of the airline's 100-series 727s and 28 of the
200-series model.
   ``During the inspection of the 727s up in Boston, we uncovered a
727 that had a 3-inch crack in the crown,'' said airline spokesman
Robin Matell, who added that the crack was in ``roughly the same
area'' as the hole in the plane in Charleston.
   Executives of the financially troubled airline insist their
safety record is one of the industry's best, and blame disgrunted
labor union officials for suggesting Eastern has a safety problem.
The airline's unions complained this year that Eastern employees
were being pressured to bypass safety procedures.
   However, an investigation by the FAA, which included inspection
of every Eastern plane, reported the airline was safe, but expressed
concern over labor-management strife that could have ``an adverse
impact on the public safety.''
   On Sunday, an Eastern A300 bound for Newark, N.J., had to return
to Miami International Airport because of an engine problem. On
Tuesday, a Fort Lauderdale-bound Eastern A300 turned back to New
York's LaGuardia airport after a problem with a door prevented the
plane from being properly pressurized.
   Two NTSB representatives from Washington were in Charleston today
to examine the plane used on Flight 251. It could be six months
before a final determination is made on what happened, said NTSB
investigator Pamela Kleckner.
   ``A few investigators are still working on the plane,'' she said
today. ``It may not move until Thursday morning.''
   Ceremsak said that the jet would be temporarily repaired and then
will be flown to Atlanta, its original destination, or Miami, the
airline's headquarters.
   As federal investigators began the investigation, they also said:
   _ Records for the past five years show the plane had made seven
unscheduled landings in the last five years before this week, but
none could be called an emergency landing.
   _ The section of the fuselage that developed the hole was a
replacement part, not the original skin of the plane.
   _ The piece that peeled away would be taken to a laboratory for
metallurgical tests.
   Fred Farrar, the FAA's spokesman, said seven unplanned landings
in five years is not unusual for a 22-year-old airplane, and Bobbie
Mardis of the FAA's safety data branch in Oklahoma City said it was
not unusual for a plane to develop cracks like those on the 727.
   ``Inspectors do periodic inspections, and cracks are one of the
items they look for,'' she said. ``It's part of normal wear and
tear.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of demonstrators, some demanding
the resignation of Sudanese leader Sadek Mahdi, protested
state-ordered price increases Wednesday, and the biggest trade union
called a nationwide strike.
   Leaders of the 2 million-member Sudan Workers' Trade Union
Federation vowed to keep workers out starting Thursday until huge
price increases are revoked.
   Airport workers anticipated the call and shut down Khartoum
International Airport Wednesday. The walkout was not announced, but
a security source confirmed it.
   Similar unrest so weakened the authoritarian government of
President Gaafar Nimeiri that a junta led by his defense minister
ousted him April 5, 1985.
   ``The head of the prime minister is a public demand!'' chanted
some protesters in front of the headquarters of the official Sudan
News Agency.
   Groups ranging from a few hundred people to more than 1,000
flooded the streets, even after nightfall Wednesday, for a second
straight day of demonstrations.
   ``Shame on you Abdulla!'' chanted some, referring to Information
Minister Abdulla Mohamed Ahmed.
   It was Abdulla who Monday announced the government was increasing
the price of sugar by 600 percent and cigarettes by 50 percent. He
also announced a new 15 percent sales tax on all locally
manufactured commodities.
   Protesters, mostly workers and students, took the streets Tuesday
to demand that Prime Minister Mahdi resign with his elected civilian
government.
   On Tuesday night, after 5,000 people demonstrated in downtown
Khartoum, the leadership of Mahdi's Umma Party met and asked the
government to revoke the increases.
   Earlier the government, a multiparty coalition led by the Umma,
announced it would not go back on its decision.
   The increases came two days after the government raised wages of
public and private workers by 50 percent to 500 percent, effective
Dec. 1.
   Finance Minister Omar Nur Dayem said Tuesday the price increases
were needed to raise more than $262 million to finance increased
salaries of public employees and food subsidies.
   In its call for the general strike, the trade union federation's
general secretary charged the government reneged on commitments it
made to Sudanese labor.
   Mahjoub az-Zubair said the federation sent a memorandum to
Mahdi's Cabinet demanding it ``immediately cancel the new prices,
especially the inordinate rise in the sugar prices and other taxes.''
   The memorandum said the increases were ``unprecedented in the
history of Sudan'' and that the salary raises were supposed to have
been effective July 1.

   President Reagan was informed at his Bel Air
home today of the British announcement that a bomb caused the
Pan-American jumbo jet crash in Scotland, and the White House
pledged ``all available resources'' to find out who was responsible.
   ``This morning the president was informed by National Security
Adviser Colin Powell that the British Department of Transport has
determined that the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 was caused by a high
explosive device,'' Deputy White House Press Secretary Leslye Arsht
said.
   The jetliner crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland a week ago, killing
the 259 people aboard, and 11 missing townspeople are presumed dead.
   ``We have closely cooperated with the British investigation,''
Ms. Arsht said. ``We agree with the results of their investigation.''
   ``The investigation will continue to determine how the explosives
were introduced into the plane,'' she said. ``The FBI and the FAA
are working closely with the British and Scottish authorities on the
investigation. We are determned to find out who did it, using all
available resources.''
   The president is staying during the holidays at the home in the
Bel Air district of Los Angeles in which he will live after he
leaves office Jan. 20.
   Ms. Arsht did not say at what time he was informed of the
announcement in London.

   A mother holding a child on her lap was
shot to death in her living room by a neighbor upset with her
husband for parking a truck in his driveway, police said.
   Tonya Stevens, who was in her mid-20s, was hit in the neck by a
bullet fired through the window shortly Tuesday night. Her husband,
Michael, was outside and saw the gunman shoot, said police Lt.
Thomas Jones.
   The gunman fled, and no arrest had been made by Wednesday
morning, police said.
   The child in Mrs. Stevens' lap was not harmed, police said. The
child's age was not given. Mrs. Stevens had two other children.
   Her husband had argued with a resident of a boarding house
earlier in the day because Stevens had parked in the neighbor's
driveway, police said.
   ``It doesn't look like she was the intended target,'' Jones said.
``Whoever he (her husband) was arguing with apparently retaliated
and fired into the house.''

   Rare twin hippopotamuses born on Christmas

said Wednesday.
   ``The mother is being extremely protective. She tries to place

   The twin hippos, which weigh about 40 pounds each, are believed
to be the first born in captivity in the United States in 25 years,
Winbigler said.
   ``This is an extremely rare occurrence,'' he said. ``We have
found that less than 1 percent of hippos born are twins.''
   The twins are the offspring of Julie and Uebi, the parents of 11.
   ``Both seem OK; there's been no trouble,'' Winbigler said.

<TEXT>
   A gasoline tanker exploded into a fireball
seen 20 miles away today in one of two spectacular pre-dawn
accidents that closed an icy stretch of Interstate 5 for hours. At
least nine people were injured, authorities said.
   The trucker and a Shasta County sheriff's deputy were slightly
injured in the tanker mishap, the Highway Patrol reported. At least
seven people were hurt in the second accident.
   The accidents, both blamed on bad weather, closed about 20 miles
of the major north-south artery for three hours. The northbound
lanes remained closed five hours after the wrecks.
   Seven inches of snow had fallen in the area, about 250 miles
north of San Francisco, on Tuesday.
   In the second accident, a tractor-trailer rig skidded on ice,
crossed the center divider and flipped on top of an oncoming
passenger van, the CHP said. Other details, including the extent of
injuries, were not immediately available.
   The first crash occurred about 5:50 a.m. as a tractor towing a
double-tanker loaded with 8,500 gallons of gasoline was northbound
on a bridge over the Sacramento River, said CHP spokeswoman Teri
Halsey.
   The truck it ran into a car that had skidded and was sideways in
the roadway, and then that car slammed into a second car on the side
of the road, she said. A third car then ran into the tanker.
   ``It was chaotic,'' she said. The drivers fled before the tanker
caught fire, but all four vehicles burned to the ground, she said.
   Halsey said the truck driver, Gerald Askey, 42, of Paradise,
suffered a laceration, while Shasta County deputy sheriff Paul
Tisserand injured his knee when his patrol car skidded into one of
the vehicles at site of the wreck.

<HEAD>USDA Proposes Reduced Restrictions on British Pork</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department proposed Wednesday
to reduce import restrictions on shipments of British swine, pork
and pork products.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the proposal is a result of
Great Britain's eradication of hog cholera, a contagious and
sometimes fatal disease of swine. He said no case of the disease has
been reported since August 1987.
   The restriction currently requires that pork and pork products be
cooked, heated or cured and dried before being shipped from Britain
to ensure that disease organisms were destroyed.
   Under the proposed rule change, small quantities of untreated
pork and pork products for personal consumption will be allowed to
enter the United States from Britain. However, commercial shipments
must orginate only from plants which meet U.S. requirements.
   Glosser said the proposal would affect some U.S. swine producers
who have expressed a desire to import swine breeding stock or semen
from Britain. However, he said, these expected shipments ``would not
have an impact on U.S. swine production.''
   The proposal will be open for public comments until Feb. 27.
Those should be sent to: Regulatory Analysis and Development, APHIS,
USDA, Room 866 Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,
Md. 20782. Refer to docket no. 88-149.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush today chose Robert Gates,
the controversial No. 2 official at the CIA, to be his deputy
assistant for national security.
   Gates was President Reagan's choice to head the intelligence
agency after the death of William Casey. But Reagan withdrew Gates'
nomination in March 1987 amid questions about his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Gates, 45, joined the CIA in 1966 and was a member of the
National Security Council staff from 1974 to 1979.
   ``He knows the system, the critical importance of the interagency
process for presidential decision-making and the details of the
management of that process,'' Bush said in a statement issued in
Washington.
   Gates will be deputy to Brent Scowcroft, Bush's designated
national security adviser, a Bush spokesman said. In the Reagan
White House, Lt. Col. Colin L. Powell serves as national security
adviser and John D. Negroponte is his deputy.
   Bush, who is vacationing in Texas, also announced the nomination
of Richard Kerr to replace Gates as deputy CIA director. Kerr is
currently deputy CIA director in charge of intelligence.
   Kerr's nomination is subject to Senate approval; Gates' position
is not.
   During the height of the Iran-Contra investigation, even some
Republican senators questioned whether Gates should remain at the
CIA after it was disclosed that he helped Casey prepare testimony to
Congress that some called misleading.
   Gates denied at the time that he or the agency tried to cover up
CIA participation in the Iran arms deal.

   Israeli soldiers fatally shot two Palestinian
teen-agers Wednesday during a clash with youths in the West Bank and
killed three suspected guerrillas trying to sneak into Israel from
Lebanon, the army said.
   The infiltration attempt was the second reported in the area this
week. Israel radio quoted an army captain as saying an Israeli
patrol at the border fence spotted the guerrillas.
   A general strike shut shops and offices in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, where Palestinian are protesting Israeli rule.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, troops opened fire to
disperse stone-throwing youths and one teen-ager was killed, an army
spokesman said. He said soldiers were forced to fire in a ``violent
clash'' in the city's central market area.
   The victim was identified by hospital officials as Samir
Shehadah, 18.
   In the West Bank village of Rihiya, troops fatally shot
19-year-old Jibril Jaber Hirsh, the army and Israel radio said. Arab
reports said troops opened fire on Arab youths who hurled rocks at
Israeli workers repairing an electrical line near the village.
   The two deaths raised to at least 339 the number of Palestinians
slain since the uprising began on Dec. 8, 1987. Fourteen Israelis
also have died.
   Also Wednesday, eight Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire
in West Bank and Gaza Strip clashes, Arab doctors said. The army
said it was checking the reports.
   Curfews were imposed on four refugee camps in the Gaza Strip,
confining 150,000 Palestinians to their homes, the army said. The
Deheisha refugee camp near Bethlehem in the West Bank also was put
under curfew, it said.
   Meanwhile, the Hebrew daily Davar reported Wednesday that Israeli
Attorney General Yosef Harish this week told the army he will
re-examine the use of plastic bullets because of rising deaths from
the ammunition.
   Davar said that 22 people were killed and 310 wounded in the
occupied territories with plastic bullets so far this month. The
bullets were introduced in the fall with the idea they would cause
fewer deaths than regular bullets.
   In southern Lebanon just above Israel's border, soldiers cornered
three would-be infiltrators about 3 a.m. in the Israeli-controlled
``security zone,'' an army spokesman said.
   They were about 100 yards north of the Israeli border community
of Kibbutz Manara, he said.
   It was the third infiltration attempt since the United States
agreed Dec. 14 to begin talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization after PLO chief Yasser Arafat announced he was
renouncing terrorism.
   In Lebanon on Wednesday, the Palestine Liberation Front said its
members had engaged in an unspecified shootout with Israeli troops.
The front is a small, radical splinter group of the PLO.
   But Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
the attempted infiltration showed that ``all the talk about the PLO
renouncing terrorism is nonsense.''
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, head of Israel's northern command, said
the guerrillas were trying to cross the border to attack Kibbutz
Manara.
   ``When they get within meters of a settlement, it's easy to guess
their goal. Their goal was the settlement,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Paratroopers killed three Palestinian guerrillas in the same area
Monday. The same day, three guerrillas drowned in a dinghy off the
coast of Lebanon as they reportedly were trying to make their way to
Israel.

   President Roh Tae-woo ordered a
crackdown Wednesday on all illegal demonstrations and said violent
protests are a major threat to the nation's democratic and economic
stability.
   The opposition said the government was afraid of lowing power.
Top opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said Roh's directive was ``a plot
schemed by fascists not to lose their invested rights.''
   He said government hardliners were attempting to create a false
sense of crisis to frighten people into supporting Roh and
justifying restraints on government opponents.
   Roh spoke in an unsually tough, nationally televised address. He
issued a ``special directive'' to security forces to take immediate
steps to end all violent and illegal protests by opposition and
labor groups, and he said officials who failed to enforce law and
order would be dismissed.
   ``Unlawful and disorderly developments and excessive demands
gushing forth in the course of liquidating authoritarianism ... are
threatening not only democracy but also the stability of the free
economy,'' Roh told a meeting of key government officials.
   Government leaders are concerned protests could increase
opposition to Roh because the public already is angry over
corruption and human rights abuses under former president Chun
Doo-hwan. Roh is trying to block widespread demands that Chun be
punished.
   Radical students and dissidents have staged a series of violent
protests in recent months to demand the overthrow of the Roh
government. Radicals also have staged scattered attacks on
government and U.S. military facilities.
   The protests have been small compared to major anti-government
protests in 1987. But officials have expressed concern at the
increasing use of violence by radicals.
   Roh said the radicals' use of firebombs and homemade explosives
in protests have ``reached a serious phase.'' No deaths and just a
few serious injuries have been reported in recent protests.
   The president also expressed concern about frequent violent
strikes and warned that labor unrest was a threat to economic
stability. He said the government will still support peaceful and
legal trade union activity, but he said violence and excessive union
demands will not be tolerated.
   Roh said South Korea was well on the way to democracy and that
violent extremists would not be allowed to pose a threat to national
stability or the desire of the great majority of Koreans for orderly
change.
   ``Law and order will be thoroughly established,'' he said.
   Roh has promised to hold a referendum on his rule next year, and
government leaders fear the controversy surrounding Chun could
damage his chances of winning. Roh, a former ally of Chun, is
identified with his predecessor in the eyes of some Koreans.
   The president reportedly also is under pressure from government
hardliners unhappy about political protests and growth of opposition
and leftist groups.
   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in
1980, went into rural exile last month after apologizing for abuses
under his rule.
   Roh, also a former general, won presidential elections in
December 1987. He has dismantled most of the authoritarian controls
imposed by Chun.

   American high school students have an alarming
deficit of economic knowledge, according to a survey in which
two-thirds didn't understand profits and more than half couldn't
supply a definition for demand.
   Economic education is ``not in the kind of shape wewant it to
be,'' former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul A. Volcker said
Wednesday at a news conference sponsored by Joint Council on
Economic Education, a non-profit coalition that underwrote the
survey.
   The survey, a 46-question multiple choice exam taken in May 1986
by 8,205 11th- and 12th-grade students in public and private high
schools in 42 states, found:
   _ Only 34 percent could correctly define profits as ``revenues
minus costs.''
   _ 39 percent selected the correct definition of Gross National
Product: ``the market value of the nation's output of final goods
and services.''
   _ Only 45 percent realized that government deficits result when
spending exceeds tax revenues.
   _ Less than half _ 47.7 percent _ knew that ``economic demand''
for a product refers to how much ``people are willing and able to
buy at each price.''
   The news is ``not good if you believe that a basic understanding
of our economic system is important if this country is indeed to be
effective in what everyone realizes is a period of global
competition,'' said Volcker, who confessed that he himself had never
taken economics in high school.
   The exam was the first to document a paucity of economic
knowledge among U.S. students.
   Economics thus joins a growing list of disciplines including
writing, geography, foreign language, science and math where recent
tests have shown U.S. students achieving at dismal levels.
   The ``Test of Economic Literacy'' was devised by William B.
Walstad, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln economics professor, and
John C. Soper, an economics professor at John Carroll University in
Cleveland.
   Walstad urged states and school districts to make economics a
part of the curriculum from elementary school on, to require it for
high school graduation and to provide teachers with the necessary
background to teach it.
   ``Teachers are the first to realize that they have inadequate
background in the subject,'' said Roxanne E. Bradshaw,
secretary-treasurer of the National Education Association, the 1.9
million-member teacher union.
   Japan requires all high school students to take at least a
semester of economics, Walstad said. But only 28 states require
economics in the curriculum in some form, and just 15 require a
specific course in economics for graduation.
   ``All too often economics is simply left out of the list of
required subjects in recent calls for educational reform,'' Walstad
said.
   On average, students correctly answered only about 40 percent of
the test questions. But they did even more poorly on questions
pertaining to inflation, the effects of tariffs on trade, and the
impact of investment on economic growth.
   Economic illiteracy is apparently even more pronounced among
minority students.
   Among students who had some high school economics, whites scored
an average of 53 percent, while blacks scored 42 percent and
Hispanics 46 percent.
   Among youngsters who had taken no economics courses, whites
answered 41 percent of the questions correctly, blacks 33 percent
and Hispanics 36 percent.
   Rudolph Oswald, director of research of the AFL-CIO, called the
results ``appalling.''
   ``They rationalize better than any series of speeches the reasons
why organized labor feels it can only gain from an economically
literate population,'' Oswald said.

   South Korea on Wednesday agreed to
North Korea's proposal for high-level political and military talks
to ease tension with the eventual goal of reuniting the rival
nations after more than 43 years.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon accepted North Korea's Nov. 16
proposal. He suggested in a letter to his North Korean counterpart,
Yon Hyung Muk, that they head seven-member delegations to
alternating talks in Seoul, capital of South Korea, and Pyongyang,
capital of North Korea.
   Kang offered to discuss ending mutual slandering, building
``mutual trust in military matters'' and promoting exchanges in
various areas.
   He also suggested discussing a meeting between South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo and North Korean President Kim Il Sung.
   ``To wipe out mutual distrust and restore trust between them, the
two Koreas should recognize each other's ideologies and systems,
conduct dialogue on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference
and develop cooperative relations on the principle of mutuality,''
Kang said in the letter, which was delivered to North Korea at the
Panmunjom truce site in the demilitarized zone.
   Kang also asked that preparatory contacts be made in Panmunjom in
February to discuss procedural matters for the proposed prime
ministers' talks, with vice minister-level officials as chief
delegates.
   North Korea had proposed wide-ranging talks on reducing military
strength, but South Korea did not refer to troop reduction, and its
proposal was more vague.
   Kang did not refer to Pyongyang's proposal that the talks discuss
withdrawing U.S. troops from South Korea. About 42,000 U.S. troops
are in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   He indirectly rejected North Korea's bid for three-way talks by
saying in his letter that Korean peace and unification are basically
``our national problems that should be resolved between the the two
parties concerned.''
   On Dec. 20, North Korea renewed its bid for tripartite talks
involving the two Koreas and the United States to discuss American
pullout and a mutual reduction of the two Koreas' armed forces.
North Korea says the American military presence hinders Korean
unification.
   South Korea said the prime ministers should head the delegations,
but North Korea had proposed deputy prime ministers. Procedural
matters have been a major problem in arranging inter-Korean talks in
the past.
   The Koreas each have been pressing major initiatives to end their
long, bitter confrontation. Each side has tended to stress its own
initiatives and play down the other's proposals.
   Delegations of lawmakers from both sides planned to resume
negotiations Thursday in Panmunjom to clear the way for full-scale
parliamentary talks on non-aggression and other matters. South Korea
expects the full talks to be held next spring.
   Talks held intermittently since 1972 on reducing tension failed
to make progress.
   Seoul officials have expressed mistrust about North Korea's
intentions. They say North Korea's insistence on discussing
withdrawal of U.S. troops indicated Pyongyang may be using the talks
to try to weaken South Korea.
   South Korean officials say American forces are needed for the
foreseeable future to prevent a North Korean attack. American
officials have said the forces will remain as long as South Korea
wants them.
   The two Koreas have hundreds of thousand of troops facing each
other along the 150-mile border. The border is sealed, and the only
communication link is a hot line.
   U.S. and Soviet forces divided the Korean peninsula when they
ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II in 1945.
North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, starting the three-year
Korean War.

   President Reagan on Wednesday extended the

the Libyan government continues to support international terrorism.
   Reagan issued a notice continuing the national emergency that he
declared on Jan. 7, 1986, ``to deal with the unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of
the United States'' that he said was posed by Libyan actions.
   The emergency must be extended every six months for the United
States to continue measures it took in 1986 to freeze Libyan assets
in this country.
   ``The government of Libya continues to use and support
international terrorism, in violation of international law and
minimum standards of human behavior,'' the president said.

   Authorities found the charred bodies of
44 suspected anti-government militants along roads in southern Sri
Lanka, a police official said Wednesday.
   The officer, who asked not to be identified, said the victims had
been shot to death and then burned earlier in the week.
   In a communique, the government blamed the slayings in the south
on the People's Revolutionary Red Army, which materialized slightly
more than a month ago to counter terrorism by Sinhalese radicals.
   The charred bodies were found along roads in southern Sri Lanka,
the Sinhalese heartland, the officer said.
   At least 19 bodies were found on Monday and Tuesday near
Tissamaharama, about 110 miles south of Colombo, the officer said.
Other bodies were discovered in nearby towns of Dickwella,
Middeniya, Tangalle, Weerakatiya and Lunagamvegara, he added.
   An extremist Sinhalese group, the People's Liberation Front,
oppose the government's efforts to end the 5-year-old insurgency by
militant Tamils demanding a separate homeland in the northern and
eastern provinces. More than 8,500 people have died in the fighting.
   In other violence, the officer said a Sri Lankan sailor was shot
and killed by Tamil guerrillas in in Jaffna, 196 miles north of
Colombo on Tuesday. An Indian soldier was killed when he was caught
in a sniper fire in Jaffna town on Tuesday, he said.
   The Tamils are mostly Hindu and make up 18 percent of the
island's population. They have long accused the majority Sinhalese
of denying they jobs and education. The Sinhalese, predominantly
Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the population.
   The Sinhalese-dominanted government signed an accord in July 1987
offering limited autonomy to the Tamils.
   While militant Tamils say the accord does not meet enough demands
for self-rule, Sinhalese extremists contend the accord grants too
many concessions and have vowed to kill anyone who supports the
agreement.
   India has an estimated 47,000 troops in Sri Lanka to enforce the
peace accord.
   Front members have been blamed for more than 900 murders since
the accord was signed 17 months ago. Most of the victims have been
supporters of the governing United National Party or security
personnel.
   The People's Revolutionary Red Army surfaced about a month before
the Dec. 19 presidential election and began hunting front members.
   Authorities have said they believe the red army is comprised of
members of paramilitary units, a leftist political organization and
a Tamil rebel group.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Wednesday extended the
territorial waters of the United States from three miles to 12 miles
to conform to the standard set down by a United Nations agreement in
1982.
   The presidential proclamation said the extension will give the
United States, for an additional nine miles offshore, ``a
sovereignty and jurisdiction that extend to the airspace over the
territorial sea, as well as to its bed and subsoil.''
   Assistant White House Press Secretary Bob Hall said the action
was taken because almost all other countries in the world use the
12-mile limit, and the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea had
called on all nations to conform.
   The president said the action ``will advance the national
security and other significant interests of the United States.''
   The proclamation said the new limit applies to the ``territorial
sea of the United States of America, the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other
territory or possession over which the United States exercises
sovereignty.''
   Reagan said ships of all countries would continue to have ``the
right of innocent passage'' through U.S. territorial waters and
ships and aircraft of all countries would have ``the right of
transit passage through international straits.''
   He said the proclamation does not extend or alter existing
federal or state law, or impair the determination of maritime
boundaries.

   Hungry bookworms of the non-human variety are
destroying thousands of priceless volumes in libraries in southern
China, a newspaper said Wednesday.
   An investigation team recently checked nearly 10,000 volumes of
ancient Chinese and foreign books in six libraries in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region and found 81 percent had been attacked by
worms, the official People's Daily said Wednesday. One-fifth were
seriously damaged.
   One volume contained 90 worms, it said.
   The report did not explain the reason for the infestation or say
if it was related to Guangxi Zhuang's near-tropical weather. But it
said most libraries lack preservation funds and expertise.
   Library administrators ``stand by helplessly while under their
eyes much of a priceless historical and cultural legacy is eaten,''
the paper said.
   ``Unless effective measures are not taken quickly ... then in a
few decades many rare books are in danger of being eaten entirely,''
it said.

   An arms control treaty which deeply reduces
U.S. nuclear arsenals could hurt American national security unless
new and better protected atomic weapons are built, a study said
Wednesday.
   One of the solutions to the problem is the building and
deployment of 300 to 500 of the so-called Midgetman single-warhead
atomic weapons, said the report by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
   The year-long study was the latest round in what is expected to
be a major national security battle within the administration of
President-elect Bush over the future of U.S. nuclear forces.
   The United States and the Soviets are negotiating at the
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) for a 50 percent cut in the
long-range atomic arsenals of each country.
   At the same time those talks are going ahead, the Pentagon faces
serious budget problems because defense spending is likely to be
frozen for the foreseeable future, despite plans by each of the
services to buy more weapons, the study said.
   The study was produced by a leading conservative think-tank.
Among participants in the report were Thomas Moorer, former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Joseph Nye and Walter Slocombe,
two senior State Department officials from the Carter administration.
   Any START treaty is likely to require the reduction of large
numbers of U.S. atomic weapons, the study noted.
   It warned that ``START, without a modernization program to
improve the survivability and effectiveness of remaining U.S.
forces, could be deleterious to U.S. deterrent policy.''
   The report suggested building a post-START arsenal which includes:
   _300 to 500 of the Midgetman weapons, each of which would be
deployed in a mobile mode in its own silo.
   _18 to 20 Trident missile-firing submarines, a Trident force
generally smaller than planned by the Navy.
   _Deployment of 100 stealth B-2 bombers by the end of the century.
The Air Force is now planning to buy 132 of the radar-evading planes
at an estimated cost of $68 billion. The plane, which was unveiled
to the public a month ago, would be in addition to the 100 B-1
bombers already built.
   The study proposed the three classes of weapons as the new
members of the U.S. nuclear triad, which includes land- and
sea-based missiles and manned bombers.
   The biggest fight is likely over the land-based missiles, which
are intended to replace the aging force of Minuteman weapons.
   Congress has already approved construction of 50 MX weapons, to
be placed in fixed silos, but the Reagan administration is pushing
for 50 more of the 10-warhead weapons for placement aboard trains.
Eventually, all 100 MX weapons would be moved to the trains,
according to administration officials.
   Congressional Democrats have backed the single-warhead Midgetman,
and the current Pentagon budget bill directs Bush to make a decision
by March 31 about whether to continue spending research money for
both the rail-based MX and the Midgetman.
   Building up to 500 Midgetman weapons would cost an estimated $30
billion, while the rail-based MX weapon would cost an estimated $13
billion, the study noted.

   The nation's love of a good laugh persisted
throughout 1988 as comedies dominated the year's 10 most popular
films and adult-oriented dramas were shut out of the top 10.
   Six of the top-grossing movies were comedies, led by ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit,'' ``Coming to America'' and ``Big.'' Bill Murray's hit
``Scrooged,'' released late in the year, was expected to just miss
making the top 10, with five days of box office receipts yet to be
counted.
   Action-adventure spectacles ``Die Hard'' and ``Rambo III'' also
attracted large audiences, as did the children's fantasy ``Willow''
and the youth melodrama ``Cocktail.''
   This list, compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co., includes films
released in the 1988 calendar year only. Box-office hits such as
``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and ``Moonstruck'' were released in late
1987 and are not included. The gross domestic earnings include the
long Christmas weekend ending Monday, and are not estimates of the
total for the year.
   1. ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' a Disney film directed by Robert
Zemeckis and starring Bob Hoskins and a host of animated characters
called ``toons.'' $149.8 million.
   2. ``Coming to America,'' a Paramount film directed by John
Landis and starring Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall. $128 million.
   3. ``Big,'' a 20th Century Fox film directed by Penny Marshall
and starring Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins. $111.7 million.
   4. ```Crocodile' Dundee II,'' a Paramount picture directed by
John Cornell and starring Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski. $109.2
million.
   5. ``Die Hard,'' a 20th Century Fox film directed by John
McTiernan and starring Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. $79.5 million.
   6. ``Cocktail,'' a Disney film directed by Roger Donaldson and
starring Tom Cruise and Bryan Brown. $76.5 million.
   7. ``Beetlejuice,'' a Warner Bros. release directed by Tim Burton
and starring Michael Keaton and Geena Davis. $73.2 million.
   8. ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' an MGM@UA film directed by Charles
Crichton and starring John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline.
$59.9 million.
   9. ``Willow,'' an MGM@UA film directed by Ron Howard and
starring Val Kilmer and Joanne Whalley. $55.7 million.
   10. ``Rambo III,'' a Tri-Star release directed by Peter MacDonald
and starring Sylvester Stallone and Richard Crenna. $53.7 million.

   President Reagan on Wednesday signed a
seven-page executive order implementing legislation passed in the
last Congress that overhauled U.S. trade laws.
   Leslye Arsht, deputy White House press secretary, said the order
``will enable the United States to continue effectively to work for
more open world markets and strengthened international
institutions.''
   The 1,100-page legislation assigns a number of authorities and
responsibilities to the president. Reagan said the objective of his
order was ``to ensure that the international trade policy of the
United States shall be conducted and administered in a way that
achieves the economic, foreign policy, and national security
objectives of the United States and in a coordinated manner under
the direction of the president.''
   Reagan was in California vacationing at his new home.

   A state appeals court has upheld Raquel
Welch's $10 million award in her lawsuit against Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
and others over her firing from the 1980 movie ``Cannery Row.''
   Justice Arleigh Woods, in an opinion Friday, upheld Miss Welch's
arguments that she was fired without reason except to make her a
scapegoat for cost overruns.
   Miss Welch was replaced by Debra Winger. ``Cannery Row,'' which
also starred Nick Nolte, was a box-office flop. Miss Welch has not
had a movie role since.
   Under Miss Welch's contract, she was entitled to full payment if
fired without cause. She was sacked after she put her makeup on at
home rather than at the studio. The actress said she had permission
to do that.
   A jury awarded Miss Welch $2 million in compensatory damages and
$8 million in punitive damages. The defendants included MGM, its
president, David Begelman, and the movie's producer, Michael
Phillips.

   The wife of Pat Paulsen has accused the
comedian of marrying her and filing for divorce two months later to
gain control of their company.
   Linda Chaney Paulsen, 35, who married Paulsen, 61, on July 20,
filed the counterclaim Friday in response to a suit Paulsen brought
against her in September.
   The counterclaim accuses Paulsen of racketeering, libel, slander
and conspiracy. It said Paulsen took control of property belonging
to his wife and the corporation, Pat Paulsen Enterprises Inc., and
then demanded $85,000 to get it back.
   ``We look forward to seeing how the defendants substantiate the
claim,'' said Pat Paulsen's attorney, Bradley Friedman.
   The couple met in 1985 and formed Pat Paulsen Enterprises in
1987. Linda Chaney was to run the company and do marketing and
bookings for the comedian.
   Paulsen's lawsuit claimed she defrauded him of $200,000 by
diverting the money from business accounts into her personal
accounts. Paulsen also alleged she secretly met with National
Enquirer reporters to set up a story harmful to him.
   Each party has also filed for divorce.

<HEAD>Administration Faults Allies For Not Pulling Defense Load</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allies in Europe and Asia should bear a larger
share of mutual defense costs, but that would not justify reductions
in U.S. military spending, the Reagan Administration said Wednesday.
   ``The European countries, Japan as well, can afford to invest
more in their defense programs than they are doing today. They
should do this, the requirement is there, the ability to pay is
there,'' said Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV.
   ``We have ... unmet security needs and we have allies who in
terms of their prosperity can afford do more to meet those and they
should do that,'' Taft told a news conference at which he presented
a report that was signed by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Although the United States is less able than some of its allies
to boost security spending, said Taft, the assumption of a greater
burden by other Western nations would not justify cuts in the
American defense budget.
   ``The way we have addressed this is not as an opportunity for the
United States to do less than it is doing,'' he said. ``Our view is,
and we have been emphatic about this throughout the discussion, is
that the United States needs to do at least as much as it is doing,
that it can afford to do what it is doing.''
   Likewise, said Taft, the announcement by Kremlin lof Mr. Gorbachev
are extremely welcome and are the
results of our having done more, and that if we really want to make
sure that they will be followed up on, we should keep on doing what
we have been doing.''
   Taft said that domestic political considerations kept a number of
U.S. allies from increasing their defense spending and he praised
the process of consultation and negotiation that he said had
bolstered the security budgets of several key nations.
   Japan and Korea have increased their defense spending, he said,
and ``we have also seen in Europe a halt to what had been a downward
trend in the (United Kingdom) and in West Germany ....''
   Among the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
the report identified five that were not meeting the goal of
spending 3 percent of gross national product per year on defense:
Canada, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain.
   It said that Canada and Luxembourg were not meeting the NATO norm
in terms of active-duty and reserve manpower, and that Belgium,
Denmark, Luxembourg and Norway were not meeting their NATO
commitments for deployments of both troops and equipment.
   The United States, Britain, Greece and Turkey ``are making
significant contributions relative to their ability,'' it said.
   ``Italy seems to qualify as a special case in that ... it is
making major efforts to substantially improve ...'' the report said.
   ``The Netherlands and Norway comprise a middle group of nations
with regard to resources allocated to defense'' because theyould be increased,
is being
increased, and we welcome that and we support it.''
   The report echoed the findings of a statement issued Dec. 1 by
NATO defense ministers, who found ``significant differences between
individual national contributions.''
   It said the United States devoted an average 5.98 percent of its
economic output to defense 1983-1987. Greece topped that, spending
6.52 percent during the same period.
   The United Kingdom earmarked 5.01 percent of its GDP to defense;
Turkey averaged 4 percent, and Germany 3.2 percent.
   Others were: Belgium, 3.26 percent; Canada, 2.17 percent;
Denmark, 2.2 percent; Italy, 2.16 percent; Luxembourg, 1.18 percent;
Netherlands, 3.32 percent; Norway, 2.93 percent; Portugal, 3.22
percent; and Spain, 2.37 percent. The figures were adjusted for
inflation.
   France and Spain are the only members of the 16-nation alliance
not party to its integrated military structure. Iceland was not
included in either the NATO or the Reagan administration list of
NATO contributors.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Calls for Better Attitude Toward Emigres</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze blasted
consular officials on Wednesday for not treating Soviets living
abroad humanely and called for lifting the stigma of ``class enemy''
from emigres.
   Also on Wednesday, a literary newspaper said a ``civil war'' with
emigres should be stopped.
   The developments may signal a new drive by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's administration to woo Soviet emigres to support his
reform drive from abroad or even to return. Gorbachev has said the
Soviet Union is suffering from a ``brain drain'' as scientists,
writers and other intellectuals emigrate by the thousands.
   Shevardnadze, in a speech to Soviet consular officials and
diplomats summarized by the official news agency Tass, said
``serious defects'' _ mainly a disregard for the ``human factor'' _
mar the handling of visas, passports and other consular documents.
   ``Humanization of the consular service, both in reinforcing it
with first-class personnel and from the viewpoint of attention to
the main object of its functions _ the person _ is one of the main
goals of its restructuring,'' the foreign minister said.
   The weak ``humanitarian aspect'' of the Soviet consular service
is partly to blame for problems in human rights, reunification of
families and mixed marriages, Shevardnadze said.
   He said, ``so far there have been no cardinal improvements.''
   Because of problems in the consular services, Soviet emigres, who
number 20 million, have suffered along with Soviet citizens living
abroad, Shevardnadze said.
   ``Quite a few of those have been classified as our `class
enemies' today are doing much good for our country. Consular offices
must expand the circle of countrymen discovering their homeland
anew,'' Shevardnadze said in remarks quoted at a news briefing by
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov.
   The foreign minister suggested an ``emigrant lobby'' be formed
abroad to promote contacts between the countries in which they live
and the Soviet Union.
   Many Soviet intellectuals decry the country's loss of great
artists writers, ballet dancer and filmmakers to the West, and say
their work would be enriched by renewed contact. The label
``traitor'' attached to many of the prominent emigres has been
disappearing in a Soviet press campaign. Works by Joseph Brodsky, a
Soviet-born writer living in the United States, and Soviet-born film
director Andrei Tarkovsky, who died in Paris two years ago, have
appeared in their native land.
   Other prominent emigre cultural figures, such as theater director
Yuri Lyubimov, have returned home to visit or work.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta, a weekly literary newspaper, said emigres
should be welcomed home and that the practice of stripping Soviets
of citizenship should be outlawed.
   ``It's time to end the long-time civil war, it's time to conduct
engage in open disputes _ with tolerance and without hostility,''
the newspaper said.
   Shevardnadze said a draft parliamentary decree simplifies
procedures for Soviets and foreigners to travel to and from the
Soviet Union. He did not give details, but indicated the
streamlining was aimed largely at making it easier for foreign
businessmen to travel to and from the Soviet Union.
   In May, Soviet consulates were obliged to issue visas within 48
hours to foreign business people, technicians and scientists who
have established contacts with the Soviet Union.
   The foreign minister called on the Soviet Union to join the 1963
Vienna convention on consular relations. In the past, the Kremlin
has said the agreement was flawed because it didn't provide for the
inviolability of consular buildings and allows local authorities to
interfere in meetings between jailed citizens and consular officials.
   Shevardnadze conceded Soviet officials have tended to be too
security-conscious, and this was hurting the drive to improve trade
with the foreign companies.
   ``Those who take care of the security of the state must realize
that a true threat to our country will arise when we find ourselves
economically insolvent and will not be able to get the feel of
worldwide economic progress and to join the mainstream of scientific
and technological progress,'' he said.

   A dozing subway rider who objected to another

   The melee broke out around 9 a.m. on a crowded train in Brooklyn
after Dennis Davis, 38, began singing ``God Bless the Child,'' said
Al O'Leary, Transit Authority police spokesman.
   J'min Porcha, 30, who had been sleeping, objected. A fight broke
out, spilling out onto the platform, O'Leary said.
   Davis pulled a knife and stabbed Porcha in the back of the head,
police said.
   A retired police officer aboard the train, Pasquale Rocco, 52,
drew his revolver in an attempt to break up the fight and the gun
went off, wounding an off-duty conductor, Martha McLaurin, 27, in
the shoulder, O'Leary said.
   Porcha was in critical condition at Kings County Hospital, where
surgeons removed a knife plunged 3 to 4 inches into his head,
authorities said.
   McLaurin was listed in stable condition at Coney Island Hospital.
   Davis was charged with attempted murder, assault and drug and
weapons charges.

   When lawyers displease him _ by
being late, stubborn or sloppy _ Judge J. Leonard Fleet sentences
them to the supermarket to buy food for the poor.
   ``It keeps them on their toes,'' the Broward County Circuit judge
said of his reprimand, which he calls Fleet's Food Brigade.
   ``When lawyers do what they're supposed to on time, it eases the
burden on the justice system and saves the taxpayers money. At the
same time, the program is helping people. It's had some beautiful
spinoffs,'' Fleet said.
   The judge orders the lawyers to deliver cans of food to him. Then
he gives the food to non-profit organizations around the county.
   ``Judge Fleet has found a very creative way to help us,'' said
Jeanne Miley, executive director of Kids in Distress, one of the
beneficiaries.
   Since he started the program five years ago, Fleet has collected
more than 15 tons of food from at least 300 lawyers, he said.
   Most lawyers laugh when he hits them with a food fine, and some
bring food whenever they appear before the judge.
   ``Every time I go over there for a trial I figure he's going to
do it to me at least once, no matter what I do,'' said James Dawson,
a Fort Lauderdale lawyer who had to buy 24 cans of sliced pineapple
last fall.
   ``Some guys might resent it, but the program is a lot of fun, and
it does a lot of good,'' said Dania City Attorney Frank Adler, who
was ordered to donate 24 cans of lentil soup after he got into an
argument with an opposing lawyer.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration on Wednesday urged China to
remove restrictions on the travel of U.S. diplomats, saying it was
considering whether to further limit the movement of Chinese envoys
in America.
   The dispute grew out of severe limitations placed by China on the
travel of American officials stationed at the U.S. consulate in the
northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang last year.
   In response, the United States banned officials at the Chinese
consulate in Chicago from driving beyond the city and its suburbs
without permission. The U.S. decision was mandated by the 1982
Foreign Missions Act which demands reciprocal action by the State
Department in response to limitations against U.S. diplomats abroad.
   State Department officials describe the sanctions controversy as
a minor irritant to their otherwise good relations, which have been
feted this month in celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of
diplomatic ties. ``We don't feel it's a major disruption,'' said one
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the United States
hopes ``that the Chinese side will join us in seeking to remove the
restrictions.''
   But The United States was ``disappointed'' by the inconclusive
result of talks on the subject held earlier this month in Beijing as
part of semi-annual discussions on reciprocity issues. Other such
issues include housing space for diplomats, permission for
diplomats' wives to work and customs clearance regulations.
   In response to the ruling against the Chicago consulate, China
imposed travel restrictions on the U.S. consulate in the southern
port city of Shanghai several weeks ago and further limited the
Shenyang consulate officials.
   Diplomats at these two missions are now required to obtain
permission for travel 48 hours in advance.
   Diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and at the Chinese
Embassy in Washington have always been required to notify
authorities of their intention to travel, but in the United States
this is only a formality. China restricts travel to certain cities
it has declared closed areas for military reasons.
   ``We consider the Chinese restrictions to be unreasonable since
they go well beyond restrictions on'' their diplomats here, Oakley
said.
   ``We have not made any decisions regarding future actions which
we might take in the wake of these latest Chinese restrictions
imposed on U.S. diplomats in Shenyang and Shanghai,'' she said.
   The Foreign Mission Act does not proscribe a strict tit-for-tat,
leaving it to the administration to decide whether to retaliate for
the Shanghai restrictions or to make do with the ban placed on the
Chicago consulate, said the official who asked not to be named.
   ``The situation does not necessarily have to escalate,'' the
official said.
   The United States has four consulates in China, in addition to
the embassy, and China has five here.
   Travel restrictions against diplomats worldwide are also designed
to prevent espionage activity. The United States requires Soviet and
East bloc diplomats to apply for permission to travel beyong a
25-mile radius from their posts.

   Europe vowed Wednesday to stand up to
Washington ``in John Wayne fashion'' after the Reagan administration
said it would slap extra duties on European imports in retaliation
for a ban on U.S. beef treated with hormones.
   European trade officials were almost unanimous in their
condemnation of the U.S. sanctions, which will add $100 million in
additional duties to European Economic Community exports to the
United States.
   The 12-nation EEC now is expected to counter with its own set of
retaliatory sanctions on U.S. food products.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said the
U.S. decision was ``an unacceptable interference with the right each
country has to decide what is good or not for the health of its
citizens.''
   The European Commission is the executive body of the European
Community, the umbrella group of the EEC trading partnership.
   The Reagan adminstration said Tuesday it would impose the
sanctions after the EEC said it would ban imports of beef treated
with growth-inducing hormones. The ban is to go into effect Jan. 1.
   The United States is a principal exporter of hormone-treated beef.
   European Commissioner Willy De Clercq called the sanctions
``totally unjustifiable and contrary to international standards.''
   De Clercq pointed out that the EEC ban on hormone-treated beef
applies to all nations that export to the European trading bloc.
   Several EEC states already have banned the use of all hormones
for cattle breeding. The EEC itself has banned seven specific
hormones.
   Consumer groups both in Europe and the United States say such
hormones, which make beef cattle grow larger, pose potential health
threats to humans. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says there
is no evidence such hormones can harm human health.
   Argentina, Australia, Brazil and New Zealand already have agreed
to export only hormone-free meat to the EEC, but the United States
and Canada refused to accept the ban.
   Nine days ago, EEC ministers agreed on a list of U.S. products on
which an equivalent amount of duties would be slapped if the U.S.
enforced its threat to retaliate against the hormones ban.
   U.S. officials, in turn, vow to would match any move by the
Common Market.
   Alfred Kingon, U.S. ambassador to the EEC, said Wednesday that if
the Common Market goes ahead with its countermeasures, ``I think
it's fair to say that you can anticipate further action on our
side.''
   But Kenneth Warren, chairman of Britain's House of Commons trade
and industry committee, said Europe must not back down.
   ``I really do not see why we have to buy what we don't want to
eat,'' he said.
   Warren, a member of the governing Conservative Party, said on
British Broadcasting Corporation radio that ``Americans are great at
brinkmanship. We have to face them down in typical John Wayne
fashion.''
   ``These trade wars are threatened every now and again,'' Warren
said. ``We have just got to look forward to a few nights of
negotiations to clear it away. It won't benefit the Americans and we
have got to talk sense into them.''
   But Simon Gourlay, president of Britain's National Farmers'
Union, said he was against the EEC ban, claiming that natural
hormones are beneficial for improved growth rate and improve the
quality of meat.
   ``There are no detrimental side effects at all,'' Gourlay told
the BBC. ``As farmers we have sympathy with the Americans.''
   West German Parliamentary Undersecretary for Agriculture Wolfgang
von Geldern said the U.S. trade sanctions were ``unnecessary and
economically unjustified.''
   Geldern said the United States was ``trying to set an example
apparently for political reasons,'' although the EEC had built
``golden bridges'' to the United States.
   He added that there already was an oversupply of beef in the EEC
and the United States and that there was no need to artificially
raise production.
   Undersecretary of Agriculture Dimitris Kefalidis of Greece gave
full support to any EEC counter-retaliation to the U.S. trade
sanctions. ``Greece will have to take a position in favor of the
meat ban,'' he said. ``We take the issue of hormones in meat very
seriously.''
   Richard Kaiser, head of Austria's Cattle and Meat Commission,
told the Austrian News Agency that under an agreement with
Washington, U.S. meat exported to Austria contained no hormones.

   The Soviet Union will allow foreign observers and
journalists to watch the withdrawal of troops from Eastern Europe
next year, an official said in an interview published Wednesday.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced at the United Nations
Dec. 7 that the Soviet Union will unilaterally reduce its troops by
500,000. Washington hailed the step.
   Vladimir Kuklev, a spokesman for the Armed Forces' General Staff,
made the disclosure that foreigners would be allowed to watch the
withdrawal in an interview with the army newspaper Red Star.
   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, the Soviets
have allowed foreigners, including journalists and diplomats, to
watch the withdrawal and destruction of medium- and shorter-range
missiles under an agreement signed by Gorbachev and President Reagan
a year ago. They also have allowed foreign observers and journalists
to witness the Red Army's pullout from Afghanistan that began May 15.
   Kuklev told the newspaper exact timetables are still being worked
out for withdrawal of troops from East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Mongolia, but that they would all be accomplished in
1989-90.

   It will be the Social Street event of the
season, a New Year's Eve gala complete with a glittering ball
dropped from the city's tallest building at the stroke of midnight.
   All right, so the Marquette Plaza building is only nine stories
high, the ball is a second-hand disco globe purchased for $250 and
there's no clock for the crowd to watch.
   But it's a lot closer than Times Square, say organizers who are
counting on Rhode Islanders' well-known distaste for travel to
ensure a good turnout.
   ``To some people around here, going 11 miles to Providence is a
major decision,'' said Tony Makalinaw, one of the businessmen who
concocted the event to cap the city's centennial celebration. ``We
figure they'll be more willing to leave their TV and go out if they
only have to go a mile or two to Social Street.''
   The city will rely on local ingenuity rather than help from the
veteran ball-droppers of New York, Makalinaw said.
   ``We'll start the ball down the cable at a signal from the
mayor,'' he said. ``We'll have these little two-way radios, and a
guy on top of the building will lower it by hand.''
   No clock will be displayed, and Makalinaw said that could lead to
confusion. ``We'll have to synchronize our watches somehow,'' he
said. ``I guess we'll go by New York time.''

   Nathan Detroit, Sky Masterson, Harry the
Horse and the other characters in Damon Runyon's stable of ``Guys
and Dolls'' would have loved a chance to enroll in ``U. Bet,'' a
course aimed at turning out better bettors.
   The three-hour class was the brainchild of racing interests that
are opening the state's first thoroughbred horse racing track in
March. Educated bettors, they say, wager more money.
   ``It's real hands-on experience,'' said Tom Filer, marketing
director of Prairie Meadows, the new track. ``We're going to teach
everything, from how to read a racing form to how to wager to
handicapping.''
   The class, which is being offered at 19 times by Des Moines Area
Community College, has been dubbed ``The University of Betting'' or
``U. Bet.''
   ``It's an education in the entire sport,'' said Joe Rhode Jr.,
publisher of Iowa Racing News. ``We're going to start with racing in
the early 1600s in England.''
   Track announcer Milo Perkins, former announcer for Hollywood Park
in Englewood, Calif., is the professor for the class, which costs $5.
   ``I'm not really much of a track person, but I'm going to go to a
class anyway so when I do I won't be coming home broke,'' said Chuck
Baugous, director of community service for the college.

   An 81-year-old woman collapsed and died
during the funeral of her son, who died rescuing his child from an
icy river.
   Lydia Kirschbaum apparently suffered a heart attack at Monday's
service for her son James, 53, family members said. Mrs. Kirschbaum,
sobbing heavily, had been standing next to her son's wife while a
choir sang ``You Light Up My Life.''
   ``That was an emotional song for us,'' said her youngest
daughter, Diann Graham. ``And then she sobbed real deep and Jim's
wife said, `Lydia, are you all right?' and the next thing we knew we
thought she fainted.''
   Mrs. Kirschbaum was pronounced dead at Newport Community Hospital.
   Kirschbaum's cremation was postponed until after his mother's
funeral Thursday.
   He died last week when his son, Rick, fell through the ice on the
Calispell River while the two ere bird hunting. Kirschbaum went onto
the frozen river after him, falling through himself. The son was
able to make it back to shore.

<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 Chinese youths, some
yelling ``Blood for blood!'' rallied in central Nanking on Wednesday
in the fourth day of anti-African demonstrations triggered by a
fight at a dance.
   Hundreds of helmeted riot police with truncheons hit
demonstrators and shoved others into police vans as the protesters
surged into a large intersection.
   It was not clear if there were injuries or if those pushed into
vans were arrested. After several hours, the crowd began to disperse
and streets of this eastern city were quiet by midnight.
   The Africans students have been forced into hiding by the mobs.
An American who was with the Africans said the 140 students have
been kept in a factory guesthouse in suburban Nanking since Monday.
   The American, 20-year-old Heather McMillen of Portland, Ore.,
said black students are determined to go to their embassies in
Beijing.
   One of the students, from Mali, already left late Wednesday.
   ``I would be with them but I have important examinations and I
must graduate,'' said the student at Nanking Polytechnlcal Institute
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Chinese youths, in a repeat of a Tuesday night rally, began
gathering about 6:30 p.m. They shouted slogans such as ``Blood for
blood!'' but unlike protesters Sunday and Monday they did not use
racial slurs.
   ``In the beginning it was `Beat the black devils,' but we don't
support that any more,'' said student Li Min, 23. ``Now we're
calling on the government to support law and order.''
   Police used a loudspeaker to order the protesters to leave,
saying their activities were ``destroying peace and affecting the
unity of the people.'' City authorities have warned that
unauthorized demonstrations are illegal.
   At 9 p.m., about 700 protesters marched to a hotel that
accommodates mainly foreigners and stood outside for about an hour
before dispersing.
   Chinese officials say there have been no arrests of either
Africans or Chinese since the trouble began Saturday. Protesters
said some of their companions were put in police vans Tuesday night
but most were released hours later.
   China's worst outbreak of racial violence in years began Saturday
night with a fight between Chinese guards at Hehai University and
African students who refused to register Chinese girlfriends they
were taking to a campus party.
   Thousand of Chinese students, learning that 11 Chinese were hurt
in the brawl, smashed windows at the Africans' dormitories,
overturned furniture in first-floor rooms and marched on other
universities demanding the Africans be punished.
   African students fled to the train station planning to go to
their embassies in Beijing. But police forced them onto buses that
took them to a guesthouse two hours' drive away.
   Miss McMillen, who was helping serve food and water to the
Africans at the station when she too was pulled onto a bus, said 10
African diplomats from Beijing met the students Tuesday night. She
said diplomats promised to help the students reach their embassies
in Beijing.
   Miss McMillen said she and one Japanese woman left the guesthouse
late Wednesday, a day after five other Americans who accompanied the
besieged Africans returned to their schools. About 20 non-Africans,
including students from Asia and Europe, remained with the group.
   Wednesday's protest included attacks on all foreigners, not just
Africans.
   Miss McMillen said other foreign students reported that rocks
were thrown at several European women.
   ``I don't feel comfortable walking outside,'' said Miss McMillen,
a tourist who was visiting friends in Nanking.
   In the past decade China has welcomed foreign technology and
learning. But closer contacts with foreigners, whose living
conditions are usually better than those of Chinese, has bred
resentment.
   Relations with African students have been especially tense
because of widespread dislike of blacks among Chinese.
   A Mali student in Beijing, Billy Sissoko, said, ``Not a day goes
by when I'm not insulted. Today someone looked at my skin and asked
me, `After six years in China, why haven't you become whiter?'''

   Premier Branko Mikulic, under
pressure to resign for mismanaging the economy, got a temporary
reprieve Wednesday when Parliament postponed debate on his disputed
budget, an official report said. The premier's 1989 economic plans
are seen as a possible threat to the survival of his government, if
the budget debate rescheduled for January turns into a vote of
confidence.
   Debate was postponed after the northern republics of Slovenia and
Croatia rejected a draft federal budget and demanded it be
streamlined, the official Tanjug news agency said.
   The Parliment's finance committee introduced ``emergency
financing'' of the budget until a final agreement is reached, Tanjug
said.
   In another apparent boost to the beleaguered premier, leaders of
the national trade union federation Wednesday refused to demand
Mikulic's resignation, Belgrade radio reported. It said union
leaders decided to withhold their judgement until they review the
premier's performance in January.
   In the past month, the government has come under increasing
attack from the press, which blames Mikulic's economic policies for
the 250 annual inflation rate, the 15 percent unemployment and a
sharp drop in living standards.
   The country this year registered more than 1,000 strikes by
workers protesting their plummeting buying power.
   On Tuesday, more than 1,200 railroad workers walked off their
jobs in Slovenia to demand pay increases and the resignation of the
premier. The strike caused major disruptions in rail traffic, and
railway officials brought in engineers from other parts of the
country to break the strike, according to media reports.
   The railroad workers returned to their jobs Wednesday after they
were promised that a government-appointed comission will look into
their grievances.
   The average salary of the striking engineers, who were demanding
a 100 percent wage increase, is about $300, Tanjug said.
   The average monthly salary in Yugoslavia has fallen from $110
dollars to $87 dollars this year, according to the state-run press.
   In 1988, wages have dropped 8.8 percent in real terms and
productivity by 2.1 percent, according to official statistics.
   Oscar Kovac, a government minister in charge of negotiating the
rescheduling of the country's $21 billion foreign debt, resigned
earlier this month in protest of what he termed ``pressures'' on the
government to abandon market-oriented policies.
   Mikulic's reputation has been further dented by a corruption
scandal involving hundreds of government officials in his native
republic of Bosnia. The officials have been accused of obtaining
illegal financing for building luxurious vacation homes. Mikulic has
denied any involvement.

   A bomb exploded in a residential section
of the Angolan capital of Luanda, killing at least one person and
wounded 13, Angola's official news agency said Wednesday.
   ANGOP, monitored in Lisbon, said the bomb went off Tuesday
evening in an apartment block. It said a woman was killed as she was
leaving the five-story building after visiting relatives.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted unidentified sources in
Luanda as saying at least two people died.
   Angolan state TV said most of the injured were women and
children. Some of the injured were reported to be in very serious
condition.
   Witnesses interviewed on Angolan TV Wednesday blamed rebels of
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, said a
source in Luanda, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The source said the explosion damaged the logistics center of the
Angolan armed forces, next to the apartment building, and some
military vehicles.
   He said no military personal were injured in the explosion, and
the Angolan capital was calm.
   It was the fourth bombing reported in the Angolan capital this
year.

   The Pentagon said Wednesday that Air Force
officials are reviewing court documents to decide whether to take
action against a top procurement official accused of helping
industry contacts in exchange for money.
   The documents, unsealed by a federal magistrate on Tuesday,
allege that Victor D. Cohen, a deputy to the assistant Air Force
secretary for acquisitions, has given illegal assistance to defense
consultant William Galvin and his clients, who have received
contracts worth millions of dollars.
   ``Cohen's participation has ranged from providing Galvin's
clients with proprietary information to structuring procurements in
a manner that eliminates competition,'' one of the affidavits said.
   The affidavit, filed by the FBI and based primarily on wiretaps,
called Cohen ``a constant source of information and assistance'' to
Galvin. It said also that Galvin and three of his clients _ Unisys
Corp., Loral Electronic Systems Division and Cubic Corp. _ appear to
have paid Cohen for his help.
   The document says: ``Cohen's assistance to Galvin's clients can
clearly be traced to illegal payments and gratuities provided to him
by Galvin or the clients.''
   The affidavit gives no figure for total payments to Cohen, but
alleges that ``Cohen has been involved with Galvin in illegal
activity since 1982.'' The only allegedly illegal payment specified
is a check for $2,500 from Galvin to Cohen dated January 1982, which
was recorded as a deposit to Cohen's account.
   Maj. Donna Pastor, an Air Force spokeswoman, said the Air Force
``has obtained copies of the affidavits and is reviewing them to
determine if any actions are appropriate.''
   A receptionist in Cohen's office said he was ``on leave'' and
could not be reached for comment. His home telephone number is
unpublished.
   Cohen was relieved of his contracting responsibilities last June
and has been given a special assignment ``that does not involve
ongoing contractual activities,'' Pastor said. Four other Pentagon
employees who were subjects of the investigation also were relieved
of their contracting duties.
   The affidavit was filed to justify a search of Cohen's Potomac,
Md., house. His home and office were among 40 locations raided by
FBI agents last June, when the case was first revealed. No
indictments have been handed down.
   Prosecutors have said they have evidence. A hearing is scheduled for
Friday to determine whether the
those portions should remain sealed.
   The two other affidavits supported searches of the Berwyn
Heights, Md., house of Richard Seelmeyer, a self-employed
consultant, and the Rockville, Md., home and office of consultant
Bill Sanda. Those searches were carried out with the others in June.
   Most of the allegations in the affidavit regarding Cohen were
based on information obtained from wiretaps on Galvin's office phone
and a bugging device in his office.
   The eavesdropping, the government alleges, show that ``Cohen's
assistance to Galvin's clients is so well known that Galvin is not
modest in describing his relationship to Cohen.''
   In one conversation in Galvin's office, ``Galvin jokingly
responded to a client that had suggested that Galvin have Cohen work
for him when Cohen leaves the Air Force that Cohen already worked
for him and that the client should know that.''
   The phone number for Galvin's office has been disconnected and
his home phone went unanswered Wednesday.
   The Seelmeyer affidavit said the former aide to Rep. Joseph A.
Addabbo, D-N.Y., operated a small airplane used by Unisys to provide
flights for members of Congress. Information in the document was
based on wiretaps on the home and office phones of Charlie Gardner,
a retired Unisys official and outside consultant for the company.
   The affidavit charges that ``Gardner and others have sought to
corruptly influence congressional legislation on defense programs
through payment of monies and gratuities to selected congressmen.''
   Charles F.C. Ruff, a Unisys lawyer, said Wednesday he had no
comment on the allegations.
   On several occasions, according to the affidavit, Gardner
mentioned Seelmeyer's role in planning a trip from Washington to New
York for Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md. last May. Gardner said several times
that ``if Seelmeyer were to talk he could do a lot of damage'' and
that payments to Seelmeyer ``are to keep him quiet as to some of his
prior activities,'' the document said.
   Dyson has denied any impropriety in the trip, during which he
visited a Unisys facility.
   Those who answered the phone at Seelmeyer's home hung up when
requests were made to speak with him. The Post quoted him as saying,
``I didn't have any role in making that trip ... I knew they were
going up there but that was it.''
   The Sanda affidavit refers to the relationship between Sanda and
consultant William Parkin, also a subject of the searches. The two
allegedly provided inside information to Unisys and other defense
contractors.
   Large portions of this affidavit were deleted.

   The Soviet Union has bought additional U.S.
corn and soybean meal for delivery under a long-term supply
agreement between the two countries, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   Officials said the sales included 600,000 metric tons of corn and
600,000 tons of soybean meal. Earlier in the month, the Soviets had
canceled purchases of more than 300,000 tons of meal.
   In a separate announcement, USDA said China has bought an
additional 200,000 tons of wheat at subsidized prices, part of 1
million tons authorized for China on Dec. 7. Only 10,000 tons remain
in that authorization.
   The latest sales of corn to the Kremlin brought the Soviet
Union's total to 9.63 million tons in the agreement's sixth year,
which began Oct. 1. Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union
totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 600,000 tons of
corn would be about 23.6 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.63 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $62 million.
   The soybean meal, based on recent Decatur, Ill., prices, could
have a processor value of around $144 million.
   Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under
the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and
1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.
   The United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 28 signed an
extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had
expired on Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run
through Dec. 31, 1990.
   Under terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union is committed to
buy at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain annually, including a
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn.
   The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as
two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   In the case of China's wheat purchases, the 200,000 tons will be
provided under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   The program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to
meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the bonuses will average $23.07
per ton of wheat, or about 63 cents per bushel.
   The the EEP sales were handled by Continental Grain Co., 40,000
tons; Garnac Grain Co., 40,000; Nissho Iwai American Corp., 30,000;
Ferruzzi U.S.A. Inc., 50,000; and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 40,000.

   The first five bodies of Americans killed in the
crash of Pan Am Flight 103 were returned home Wednesday, hours after
investigators confirmed that a bomb blew up the Boeing 747 with 259
people aboard.
   The remains of Kenneth Raymond Garczynski, 37, of North
Brunswick, N.J., arrived at Kennedy International Airport aboard a
Pan Am flight from London. The light brown, pine coffin topped with
a bouquet of pink, yellow and white flowers and a blue ribbon was
transferred to a hearse.
   A later Pan Am flight from London's Heathrow Airport carried the
remains of Om Dikshit, 55, of Fairborn, Ohio; his wife, Shanti, 53,
and their two grandchildren, Suruchi Rattan, 3, and Anmol, 2, of
Warren, Mich.
   The children's mother, Garima, 29, was aboard the plane that blew
up Dec. 21 on a flight from London to New York and Detroit. Her body
apparently has not been identified.
   Reporters Wednesday were restricted to the terminal gate at the
airport.
   In Lockerbie, the Scottish village that bore the brunt of the
jumbo jet's falling wreckage, investigators announced Wednesday that
they had found ``conclusive evidence of a detonating high
explosive'' aboard the plane.
   The statement contained no clue as to who might have planted the
bomb or how it was smuggled aboard.
   A police spokesman there said it was not known when the next
bodies would depart, but the pace was expected to accelerate in
coming days.
   On Tuesday night, residents of the Scottish town paid their
respects to the five victims in an apparently spontaneous tribute.
The convoy for the coffins began at a warehouse pressed into use as
a chapel. An honor guard included police, rescue teams with their
dogs, local officials and Pan Am flight attendants.
   As a police motorcycle led the white refrigerator van past the
town hall, some people in the crowd, others bowed their heads, one
man saluted and another raised his hand in a gesture of parting as
the van rolled slowly by.

   In good news for the economy, the government
reported Wednesday that American businesses are planning to spend a
record $451.64 billion on expansion and modernization plans in the
new year.
   The Commerce Department said a survey completed in November found
that U.S. businesses are projecting a 5.9 percent increase in
investment spending in 1989 over an expected total of $426.49
billion for 1988.
   If these spending plans are realized, it would mean that 1988 and
1989 would set back-to-back spending records, surpassing the old
one-year record of $395.58 billion set in 1985.
   The boom in investment spending this year has been credited with
providing much of the momentum for the overall economy. Analysts saw
it as a good sign that businesses are planning to further expand
investment next year, although at a slower pace.
   The 5.9 percent rise in business investment expected for 1989
contrasts with a 10.8 percent jump in spending in 1988, the biggest
percentage increase since a 16.6 percent rise in 1984.
   All of the figures have been adjusted to remove the effects of
inflation.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said he expected the government survey, taken in October and
November, was understating investment plans somewhat and that later
investment surveys will show even more optimism.
   In 1988, business investment and U.S. export sales have
contributed almost half of the growth in the overall economy, which
is expected to come in above 3.5 percent this year, as measured by
the gross national product.
   The record level of export sales have prompted much of the
business investment as U.S. manufacturers have rushed to meet the
higher overseas demand.
   For 1989, Wyss said he expected growth would slow to around 2.6
percent, reflecting a reduction of the improvement in the trade
deficit and slower business investment.
   ``We think exports and investment will continue to be the
strongest areas of the economy, but they won't be as strong as they
were in 1988,'' Wyss said. ``But a little slowdown is useful right
now because the economy has really been growing too rapidly and
needs to slow to a more sustainable pace.''
   In addition to powering growth in the new year, business
investment to replace aging plants and equipment helps to boost the
U.S. productivity rate, a factor of growing importance as the
country tries to meet rising international competition.
   The 5.9 percent investment increase for all industries includes a
3.5 percent planned boost for manufacturing companies and a 7.4
percent rise for companies engaged in mining, transportation and
other non-manufacturing areas.
   In manufacturing, the Commerce Department is projecting that
spending will rise to an inflation-adjusted $170.15 billion
following an even larger 12.7 percent increase in 1988.
   The manufacturing increase includes a 2.2 percent rise in
spending at plants making durable goods and a 4.7 percent increase
at factories producing non-durable goods, items not expected to last
three years.
   Before adjusting for inflation, the department projected that
spending for 1989 would rise by 6 percent to $455.96 billion after
an anticipated increase of 10.4 percent this year.

<HEAD>President Orders Probe of Officials Linked to Auto Sales Racket</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president on Wednesday ordered an
investigation into reports that high government and military
officials were involved in an automobile sales racket.
   President Robert Mugabe appointed a judge and two private
attorneys to investigate allegations the officials had profited from
black-market sales of vehicles assembled in Zimbabwe.
   Mugabe gave the investigators _ led by Judge President Wilson
Sandura, the chief judge of Zimbabwe's highest court _ until March
15 to complete the inquiry.
   The public inquiry will focus on Willowvale Motor Industries
Ltd., a private plant that assembles most of the country's motor
vehicles.
   News reports have alleged that Willowvale illegally sold
foreign-model cars and trucks to buyers not registered as dealers
who resold the vehicles at inflatd prices. Recent press reports have
implicated 20 Cabinet ministers, senior bureaucrats and security
officers in the illegal purchases.
   Private citizens normally have to wait years to buy a car in
Zimbabwe. The demand for vehicles is five times greater than the
locally assembled supply, and imports are limited by shortages of
foreign currency needed to pay for them.
   Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament are entitled to buy
one vehicle each from the Willowvale plant at controlled government
prices, but are not allowed to resell them.
   The Chronicle newspaper has named Vice President Simon Muzenda,
army Cmdr. Rex Nhongo and three senior members of Mugabe's Cabinet
as buyers of Willowvale vehicles.
   In letters to newspapers, some citizens questioned why
politicians with high salaries should have the privilege of owning
cars when few Zimbabweans can afford bicycles and most workers wait
hours for buses because of a shortage of spare parts needed to
repair them.
   One letter asked why officials should own cars made at Willowvale
when the state already provides them free use of Mercedes-Benz
vehicles.
   Defense Minister Enos Nkala, questioned by Chronicle editor
Davison Maruziva about a car he bought from Willowvale, threatened
the journalist, according to the newspaper.
   Nkala reportedly said he would send soldiers and police to detain
Maruziva and another editor unless they divulged the source of their
information about his car purchase.
   ``I am not the kind to play with,'' Nkala was quoted as saying.

   A class of police cadets whose first week in
a grueling training program left one man dead and 13 hospitalized
graduated Wednesday, its members commended as special because of
what they endured.
   ``Your experience ... has done more to change the methods and
approach to police training in this state than any other event since
the establishment of the municipal training council in 1964,'' said
Peter W. Agnes Jr., interim executive director of the Massachusetts
Criminal Justice Training Council.
   ``You are special because of what you have endured, and you are
special because of what you and Tim Shepard have inspired us to do
for those who will come after you.''
   Shepard, 25, was among the cadets who fell ill in the first week
of training that began Sept. 19. He died Nov. 3. At least 13 others
were hospitalized with kidney and other problems resulting from
exhaustion and dehydration.
   Shepard collapsed on the running track at the end of the first
day of training and fell into a coma from heat stroke. He later
underwent a liver transplant.
   The illnesses prompted investigations into the police-training
agency by the attorney general, two legislative groups and a panel
of police chiefs, doctors and exercise experts assembled by Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis.
   A report by Attorney General James Shannon called for an overhaul
of the agency set up 24 years ago to oversee the uniform training of
municipal police.
   The report and Shepard's death prompted several firings and an
inquest to determine whether criminal charges should be brought.
Further, the training program was revised to eliminate the so-called
``stress training.''
   The 45 graduates received their diplomas in an Agawam Junior High
School auditorium filled with more than 600 friends, relatives,
police chiefs and others.
   ``The 12th class will always be labeled as the class that changed
everything,'' said David L. Pelletier, president of the class.

Guns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prison security chief and six guards have
been arrested on suspicion of accepting bribes from inmates to
smuggle guns used in a prison uprising that left 25 people dead, a
state official said Wednesday.
   Hector Ramon Martinez Roman was arrested when officials went to
his home Saturday and found him packing, Nayarit state spokesman
Francisco Flores said in a telephone interview.
   Officials believe the security chief accepted $4,300 to smuggle
at least two .38-caliber pistols and cartridges into Venustiano
Carranza penitentiary in Tepic, capital of Nayarit state. When
arrested, he had ``more money than he normally would have with his
salary,'' Flores said.
   It was not clear whether he was accused of smuggling in the guns,
or of helping inmates or their visitors smuggle the arms in.
   Handling of the riot has caused a political flap, since at least
five inmates appear to have been killed after they surrendered to
police commandos.
   Flores said Martinez Roman had been a suspect since the riot
erupted Dec. 22. The security chief disappeared shortly before a
group of inmates, angry because they were denied Christmas pardons
for good behavior, stormed the warden's office and took 19 hostages.
   Martinez Roman appeared ``unusually nervous'' when he returned to
the penitentiary in the midst of the riot on Dec. 23, Flores said.
He did not appear at work the next day.
   Warden Samuel Alvarado was shot and killed when the riot began
and inmates used the smuggled guns to seize additional arms from
guards.
   Nayarit Gov. Celso Humberto Delgado Ramirez called in special
commando units from Mexico City.
   One of the unit commanders, Juan Armando Duarte Badillo, was shot
and killed when he tried to talk mutineers into surrendering.
   Then commandos stormed the prison administrative area.
   State officials first said the commando units stormed the
penitentiary twice the evening of Dec. 23 and that 19 prisoners died
in two gunfights.
   But after reports that a television videotape contradicted their
account, officials admitted there was only one assault.
   On the videotape, five prisoners are heard giving their names,
which appear on a list of dead released a few hours later. A witness
told The Associated Press that at least one other inmate listed as
dead had surrendered.
   On Tuesday, the federal Chamber of Deputies appointed a committee
to investigate handling of the uprising.
   Flores identified the arrested guards as Marcelo Lopez Estrada,
Juan Gonzalez Muro, Camilio Lozano Ruiz, Andres Castillo Mansina,
Agustin Ortiz Monroy and Juan Soria Sanchez.
   He said officials also have arrested inmates Miguel Mejia Mejia,
Emilio Barbosa Quintero, Manuel Lopez Gonzalez and Carlos Carrillo
Mercado for assaulting officials during the riot.

   The Federal Trade Commission and Budget
Rent-A-Car Corp. settled Wednesday a complaint that the firm had
failed to give timely service to rental cars for which recall
notices had been issued.
   Under a consent agreement with the FTC, Budget agreed to inspect
and repair affected vehicles within a reasonable time.
   A spokeswoman, Jody Wilson, at Budget's corporate headquarters in
Chicago said the company had no immediate comment on the FTC
announcement.
   According to the government's complaint, Budget rented to the
general public automobiles that were subject to recall notices, and
failed to so warn customers of the potential problems.
   Under the consent agreement, Budget will inspect and repair
vehicles within 120 days after receiving a recall notice.
   Alternatively, if Budget chooses not to inspect, the order would
require Budget to disclose to prospective renters that the vehicles
may be defective.
   A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only, and does not
constitute admission of unlawful activity. Violation of the
agreement may result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per
episode..

<HEAD>Summit Holds Hopes For Improved India-Pakistan Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Asian foreign ministers on
Wednesday completed an agenda for a seven-nation summit that is
imbued with hopes for friendlier relations between regional powers
India and Pakistan.
   Benazir Bhutto, who took office as Pakistan's prime minister only
four weeks ago, for the first time will meet her Indian counterpart,
Rajiv Gandhi, when the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation opens its fourth-annual summit Thursday.
   Predominantly Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan have fought three
wars since their independence in 1947, when British colonial India
was partitioned along religious lines.
   Ms. Bhutto's ascension to power ushered in a new era. It marks
the first time Pakistan and India have leaders from the
post-partition generation, with no personal memories or experiences
of the bloodshed and cross-migrations in which their nations were
born.
   Five other nations are attending the three-day summit:
Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
   The summit's agenda was not publicly announced, but sources from
participating nations said it could provide a format for lessening
fears of nuclear weapons in the subcontinent.
   India's Narasimha Rao told his fellow ministers on Tuesday: ``We
need to take bold intiatives not only to keep our countries and our
region free of the scourge of nuclear weapons but also to work
towards mutually agreed reductions in conventional arms.''
   India's known nuclear arms capacity and Pakistan's reported
nuclear arms intentions long have obstructed improved relations
between the two countries.
   Last week Ms. Bhutto said her country has no intention of making
a nuclear device, and she said India and Pakistan have been
discussing an agreement not to attack each other's nuclear
installations. Pakistan says its nuclear facilities produce energy.
   Conference sources speaking on condition of anonymity say such a
bilateral agreement has been drafted but still is subject to
approval by Ms. Bhutto and Gandhi after they meet.

   The number of sea birds affected by an
oil spill jumped from 1,200 to 1,500 Wednesday, and biologists
scrubbing them made temporary ponds from water tanks to see if the
waterfowl are regaining their buoyancy.
   The scientists used dishwashing liquid and toothbrushes to remove
the oil spilled Thursday when a 300-foot oil barge and its tug
collided, dumping about 70,000 gallons.
   An estimated 700 birds have died, and the 300 birds that have
been cleaned so far have only a 25 percent to 65 percent chance of
survival, experts said.
   Oil ruins the insulating effect of a bird's feathers, threatening
death from cold. Birds can also become poisoned from ingesting oil
while cleaning themselves.
   Cleaned birds were held at a makeshift clinic until they regain
the natural oils that give them buoyancy.
   The birds were force-fed smelt and placed in large tanks of
water, normally used to fight forest fires, to determine if they've
regained their buoyancy, said Jani Gilbert, a spokeswoman for the
Washington Department of Ecology.
   The birds are being found on 100 miles of beaches on the
Washington and Oregon coasts, said Gilbert, who estimated the number
of waterfowl affected at 1,500.
   The species affected by the spill, which continues to drift
toward shore, included common murres, grebes, scoters, a couple of
loons and one puffin.
   After about an hour of scrubbing, the birds are rinsed and then
put in cages to allow their natural oils, which are removed in the
cleaning, to return, Gilbert said.

was struck head-on Saturday by Dobek's car, which was on the wrong
side of the road, Smith said.
   Witnesses reported that after Dobek struck Davis, he turned off
his lights, accelerated and continued for about four miles with
Davis' body in the passenger seat, his legs hanging out the
windshield, police said.
   After Dobek arrived home, several witnesses tried to talk to him
but he was incoherent and tried to push Davis' body underneath the
car, Smith said.
   ``We are looking at possible manslaughter charges, but we have no
way of knowing that until the investigation is complete,'' police
spokesman Bill Hancsak said. ``The State Attorney's Office will make
the final decision.''

   Snow is such a rare commodity in the
Middle East that the rich Arabic language only has one word with it
_ thalj. On Wednesday, however, there was enough thalj to build a
thaljman or hurl a thaljball.
   A storm moving through the area over the past three days dropped
up to three feet of snow in some areas, and forecasters were
predicting more on the way. Usually, the Middle East gets at most a
light dusting of snow.
   No weather-related casualties were reported, but gusts of up to
100 mph downed trees and power lines.
   In Jordan, the narrow gorge leading into the ancient city of
Petra, the country's main tourist attraction, had to be closed.
Officials feared that melting snow would turn it into a raging flood
course.
   Tourists looking for sun were awed by the famous pink cliffs
dusted with white.
   ``No one expected such a thing. Snow was not what the tourists
came for,'' said visitor Jan Bovirhuis of Assen, Holland. ``We found
it extremely beautiful and nice to be in Petra in the snow.''
   About 110 miles to the north, children in the hilly capital of
Amman gleefully pelted pedestrians with snowballs in freezing
temperatures and overcast skies.
   People in the area treat any snowfall as a holiday decreed by
God, with families piling into cars to head into the hills for a
closer look. In Lebanon, many mountain roads were blocked, leaving
several villages isolated.
   The Lebanese, long used to lack of government services after 13
years of civil war, were not perturbed by the abundant snow. Most
houses in the mountains have a month's supply of food and fuel on
hand for the next time militia battles make the roads unpassable.
   In Israel, snow that fell Monday covered the picturesque artists'
colony of Safed in northern Israel. Mt. Hermon, a ski spot in the
annexed Golan Heights, received about three feet of snow, according
to weather reports.
   Major roads between Lebanon, Syria and Jordan were kept open with
bulldozers.
   In lower areas the violent winds were accompanied by driving
rain, forcing people to stay indoors.
   Not every place saw the snow, of course. The Saudi Arabian Red
Sea town of Jezan was a balmy 90 degrees on Wednesday.
   But with another cold front on the way, said Ali Abandah,
director of Jordan's national weather service, the northern parts of
the Middle East may get a new round of snow for the New Year.

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush's bass-fishing
trip to a private lake Thursday will take him to a small, historic
community that once played host to another vice president, Aaron
Burr.
   Bush's itinerary calls for four hours of fishing with Ray Scott,
whose 55-acre lake is near the historic Pintlala site in rolling
terrain 15 miles south of Montgomery.
   ``We just want to get in some fishing,'' said Scott, who became a
friend, political ally and infrequent fishing partner of Bush's in
1978. ``His fishing is so token, he doesn't have a chance to get at
it much.''
   Scott, who got a call from Bush to arrange the outing, has
brought attention to a crossroads community that is little more than
a small elementary school, a library, a fire station and Mosley's
store and service station.
   Reporters and photographers descended on Mosley's in anticipation
of the visit. ``It's been a three-ring circus around here,'' said
Mary Meadows as she prepared hot dogs for the throng Wednesday.
   Scott said Secret Service agents checked out ``every squirrel
nest and deer stand'' on his property.
   Scott, who built the lake a couple of years ago and now has a
whitetail deer research program on his land, said the old Federal
Road that crossed through Pintlala _ a paved portion of which now
runs in front of Scott's gate _ was the route taken by Gen. Andrew
Jackson, later the nation's seventh president, on his way to New
Orleans during the War of 1812.
   Scott and historians also say Burr, the vice president who killed
Alexander Hamilton in a duel, paid an unplanned visit to Pintlala.
Burr was captured in Alabama in 1807 after being accused of treason
and was brought up the Federal Road. According to Scott, he spent
one night at Manac's Tavern in the town.
   Burr was acquitted of treason but remained disgraced and retired
from politics.
   Scott, who founded the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society two decades
ago and sold the publishing enterprise for $15 million in 1986, is a
conservationist who predicted Bush will rival Teddy Roosevelt in
supporting America's outdoors.
   ``He feels we've spent enough money on research ... and it's time
for action,'' Scott said. ``He'll be reasonable but firm'' in
protecting the environment.

<HEAD>Study Finds 15 Percent of Vets Suffered Post-Traumatic Stress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration said Wednesday that
a four-year study ordered by Congress concluded more than 15 percent
of the men who served in the Vietnam war are suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder.
   The survey, based on face-to-face interviews conducted with more
than 3,000 veterans, projected that 479,000 of the 3.1 million
veterans who served rtial post-traumatic stress disorder at some point
in their lives
are added, the percentages jump dramatically.
   It found that 30.9 percent of the men had suffered the full
disorder at some point in their lives and an additional 22.5 percent
suffered partially. Among women, it found 26.9 per cent had suffered
the full disorder at some time and an additional 21.2 percent a
partial disorder.
   ``These findings mean that over the course of their lives, more
than half of male theater veterans and nearly half of female theater
veterans have experienced clinically significant stress reaction
symptoms,'' said the report. ``This represents about 1.7 million war
veterans.''
   Noting that about half the men and a third of the women who had
ever suffered from the full disorder still do, the report concluded:
``These findings are consistent with the conceptualization of PTSD
as a chronic, rather than acute, disorder.''
   Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a psychological
illness tied to veterans who were involved in battle or others who
have survived stressful episodes. It is marked by flashbacks,
feelings of isolation and depression, violent outbursts and low
self-esteem.
   Among the major findings of the report:
   _27.9 percent of Hispanic male Vietnam veterans, an estimated
47,000 out of 168,000, have PTSD.
   _13.7 percent of while males, an estimated 359,000 out of some
2.6 million, have PTSD.
   _20.6 percent of black male Vietnam veterans, or 72,000 out of
352,000, have the disorder.
   The study found that almost half of Vietnam veterans have had at
least one psychiatric disorder at some point, most typically alcohol
or drug abuse or dependency.
   Vietnam veterans exposed to high levels of war stress had higher
rates than other Vietnam veterans for divorce, martial problems and
problems dealing with their children, the report said.
   The study was done by Research Triangle Institute, a private
company in Research Triangle Park, N.C.

   The search for a light plane that
disappeared with two American relief workers aboard will be extended
to neighboring Uganda, the owners said Wednesday.
   The six-seat Cessna left Nairobi's Wilson Airport on Dec. 18 on a
flight to Lokichogio, about 390 miles northwest of the capital near
Uganda.
   The plane, piloted by two Americans identified as Mike Grenell
and Gary Taylor, was declared missing after it failed to return to
Nairobi on Dec. 19 as scheduled.
   Five other planes on Wednesday completed a search for the missing
Cessna in northwestern Kenya and are to launch a search in Uganda,
said John Chynoweth, an official of Life Ministry, the Christian
relief organization that owns the plane.
   The aircraft had been loaned to Relief Transport Services, a
Lokichogio-based relief organization, Chynoweth said. He said the
missing plane was carrying aircraft spare parts.
   Taylor, 42, of Seattle, Wash., is an employee of the Life
Ministry, Chynoweth said. The official did not know Grenell's age or
hometown but said he worked for Relief Transport Services.
   Grenell arrived in Kenya four months ago, and Taylor has lived in
Kenya nine years, Chynoweth said.
   Life Ministry, a missionary organization that operates in remote
parts of Kenya, uses the aircraft to transport supplies to its
workers, Chynoweth said.

<HEAD>Second Recall Issued for Wooden Enclosures After Child's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by the death of a 17-month-old boy in
Pennsylvania, the government on Wednesday issued a second recall for
wooden, accordion-style enclosures used as playpens for small
children.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Nu-Line Industries of
Suring, Wis., is offering a $10 cash refund or $15 coupon for anyone
who returns a wooden enclosure, whether it was manufactured by
Nu-Line or another company.
   The wooden ``corrals'' fold out into a round or oval-shaped
enclosure that can be used as a playpen.
   The agency said children between 10 months and 2 years of age are
at the greatest risk because their heads can become stuck in the
diamond-shaped openings in the middle of the enclosure or the
V-shaped openings at the top.
   The enclosures have not been manufactured or sold since May 1986,
when the federal agency issued the first recall for the product.
   The agency decided to issue a second recall following the July 19
death of a 17-month-old boy in Pennsylvania, said Ken Giles,
spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   ``People still have them in their homes and that became
tragically apparent with this death,'' Giles said. The wooden
enclosures have been involved in at least 17 incidents resulting in
four deaths, the agency said.
   The enclosures were manufactured by a number of companies, some
of which have either gone out of business or have been acquired by
other companies, Giles said.
   People may reach Nu-Line by calling a toll-free number,
1-800-558-7300.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb destroyed the main office
of the Lutheran Church in the Salvadoran capital Wednesday and
damaged nearby homes, but no one was injured, a clergyman said.
   The Rev. Medardo Gomez, bishop of the Lutheran congregation in El
Salvador and pastor of the targeted parish, said the bomb was placed
in the office at the rear of the church.
   Damage to the section for worship was mainly broken windows, and
homes across the street also had their windows blown out, Gomez
said. He estimated damage at $60,000.
   No group claimed responsibility for the predawn attack which
occurred a day after publication of a communique by a newly formed
death squad. The group threatened leftists and ``those well-known
useful fools who directly or indirectly support the guerrillas.''
   El Salvador is mired in a civil war pitting Marxist-led
guerrillas against the U.S.-backed government. The Lutheran Church
has provided significant aid to refugees, whom the armed forces
consider sympathetic to guerrillas.
   ``Because of the appearance of this new organization (the death
squad), we speculate that it could be responsible. But the church
does not want to formally accuse anyone,'' Gomez said.
   The pastor said members of the church, which has about 10,000
members, have received threats, including death threats, for six
years. He said he received an anonymous death threat Friday.
   The offices of the church were burglarized in October. A bomb
damaged a Lutheran-run orphanage in August 1987.
   ``Because we've received so many blows, we consider they are
politically motivated. Because they accuse us as if we were doing
political work, which is not the case. Our work is the defense of
life,'' said Gomez.
   ``These actions won't intimidate us, on the contrary they
reinforce our resolve,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A viral epidemic has wiped out up
to 80 percent of the seals in the North Sea, and it will be at least
a decade before the population is replenished, a medical expert said
Wednesday.
   About 7,500 to 8,000 seals have died in the epidemic, which has
been linked to the virus that causes distemper in dogs, according to
Lenie 't Hart of the Seal Clinic in this northern Dutch village.
   The clinic is Europe's biggest hospital for seals.
   Before the epidemic broke out in April off the Danish island of
Anholt, there were 10,000 seals in the North Sea, Ms. 't Hart told
The Associated Press.
   The epidemic gradually made its way south along the Danish and
West German North Sea coast and eventually ended up in the Wadden
Sea, the shallow waters off the northern Netherlands.
   Ms. 't Hart said seals still are dying of the viral infection,
which undermines the animals' immune system and exposes them to
pneumonia or liver infection.
   ``They're not going to disappear'' from the North Sea, Ms. 't
Hart said, but she added, ``It's just going to take 10 to 14 years
before the seal population is back where it was before. That also
means we can't afford another disaster.''
   Animal health officials have developed a vaccine against the
virus, but they said it's unfeasible to vaccinate all animals living
in the wild. Only those seals taken into the clinic for care are
being given the vaccine.

<HEAD>Soviet Commission Hits Food and Reconstruction Problems in Quake
Zone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food is not flowing smoothly to rural areas hit by
the Armenian earthquake, and an ``irresponsible attitude'' by the
Finance Ministry is slowing reconstruction, a Communist Party
commission said Wednesday.
   It presented one of the toughest reports on organizational and
other problems in northwestern Armenia, where officials say the Dec.
7 earthquake killed 55,000 people and destroyed hundreds of
buildings.
   ``The Central Council of Consumer Societies, which was obliged to
organize a precise and uninterrupted supply of food products to
villages, has not yet managed with the mission placed on it,'' the
Politburo commission said in a report carried by the Tass news
agency.
   ``And the irresponsible approach of the (Armenian) republic's
Finance Ministry to the evaluation of damage to buildings and
structures is holding up reconstruction,'' the commission said.
   At a meeting in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, chaired by Deputy
Premier Yuri Batalin, the commission said reconstruction also was
hampered by slow unloading of badly needed supplies that are piling
up at railroad stations.
   It ordered officials of responsible agencies to take corrective
action immediately and report results to the commission.
   In Moscow, the full 13-member ruling Politburo called for
international efforts to try to predict earthquakes and ``overcome
the consequences of huge natural disasters and catastrophes,'' Tass
reported.
   During a visit to the stricken area this month, President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev told an inquiring resident that science has not yet
found a way to forecast earthquakes.
   The Politburo also said the government should form a system for
coordinating special services ``for action in extreme conditions''
and that the Academy of Sciences and other organizations should
improve the Soviet Union's seismic monitoring services.
   About 24,390 corpses have been recovered from the quake site and
15,254 people have been pulled alive from the ruins, the party body
said.
   For heroes of the disaster _ rescuers and other disaster relief
workers _ the Soviet parliament announced Wednesday the creation of
an order ``For Personal Courage.'' It will be given to Soviets ``for
courage and bravery displayed during the saving of people, the
protection of public order and socialist property, the eradication
of crime and rescue operations during natural calamities and other
emergencies,'' Tass said.

   Television monitors will be placed in
neighborhoods with high homeless populations to provide information
on available housing, free hot meals and jobs, a shelter announced
Wednesday.
   Bob Willmott, director of the Strand Helpers shelter, unveiled
the first of four television screens while distributing meals at a
public park.
   ``Hungry and cold?'' the words on the screen ask, followed by a
list of shelter phone numbers. ``Sixteen to 24 years old? Earn money
now at temporary and permanent jobs,'' the video message asks before
flashing another list of phone numbers and tips for temporary work.
   Willmott said he is hopeful that all agencies that help Seattle's
homeless will call Strand Helpers each day to provide fresh
information on how many beds are empty, who's offering ``feeds'' and
who has temporary or permanent work.
   ``We'll have no problem getting information,'' Willmott said.
``We all work together when it comes to helping people.''
   Willmott said he got the idea when he saw a television screen at
a mall telling of sales.
   The monitors were donated, Willmott said. The estimated
$1,000-a-month cost will be supported by private donations, he added.
   People living at the Strand shelter will be taught how to enter
information into the computer system, Willmott said.
   ``If we get one person a job ... so they don't go hungry ... it's
having the impact it should,'' Willmott said.
   Those who checked out the monitor gave it good reviews.
   ``It'll help feed people and keep them alive until they can find
something better,'' said Mike Casavant, 27, who just arrived from
New Hampshire. `It's another source to look at, and the more sources
you've got, the better the chance of getting into places. It's a
pretty good idea.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Forest Service's latest 50-year
analysis of the future of America's woodlands ignores the problems
posed to forests by global warming, the Senate Agriculture Committee
chairman said Wednesday.
   ``This is an inexplicable omission,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said in a prepared statement accompanying release of his letter
asking Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to order a rewriting of
the analysis.
   Leahy said there is no mention of the so-called greenhouse effect
in the draft ``Analysis of the Timber Situation in the United
States: 1989-2040,'' the latest edition of a document updated every
10 years by the Forest Service.
   The analysis, required by a 1972 law, forms the basis for the
service's long-range planning and policies for the uses and
development of national forests, including estimates of future
timber production.
   Scientists have told Leahy's committee and other congressional
panels that forests, both in this country and around the world, are
a major part of the global warming equation.
   They have said that warming could occur at a pace so rapid that
particular species of trees would be unable migrate fast enough into
the cooler climate zones that they need for survival.
   On the other side of the greenhouse coin, trees are vital
consumers of carbon dioxide, which is a byproduct of fossil fuel use
and which scientists say is collecting in the atmosphere and
trapping increasing amounts of heat.
   Leahy said that in contrast to the Forest Service analysis, a
recent study by the Environmental Protection Agency ``warns that
climate change could profoundly affect American timber resources in
the years ahead.''
   He told Lyng that the EPA study said that ``even under the
mildest warming scenarios, much of the southern half of the
Southeast would support only about half its current forests.
   ``In contrast, the Forest Service ... assessment assumes that 80
percent of all economic opportunities for increasing financial
returns from timber management will occur in the South,'' Leahy
wrote to Lyng.
   ``There is a critical relationship between climate change and
forests, and it would be a serious mistake to release the 1989
timber assessment to Congress in its present form,'' the chairman
said.
   ``Merely revising the assessment, however, will not suffice,'' he
said. ``Climate change considerations must be integrated fully and
without delay into policy analysis throughout the department,''
Leahy said.
   The chairman said the department's ``head-in-the-sand attitude is
incredible'' in light of written testimony presented his committee
Dec. 1 by Orville Bentley, assistant agriculture secretary for
research, science and education.
   In that testimony, Bentley said increased carbon concentrations
in the atmosphere ``give USDA valid reasons to be concerned about
the potential effects of climate change in this nation as well as
the world.''
   There was no immediate reaction from the Forest Service to
Leahy's statements.
   ``We've just received the letter,'' said Bob Andrews of the
service's resources, program and assessment division, which prepared
the analysis. ``We will develop a response.''

<HEAD>`Upbeat' Bush Winds Up Quail-Hunting Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEEVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush, feeling ``very
relaxed, very upbeat'' wound up his quail hunting vacation with a
final excursion into the range, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``They have been successful on the hunt, but not as successful as
in past years,'' said Steve Hart, the spokesman.
   Bush had not provided a count on the number of birds he killed,
but the hunting was less fruitful this year because of dry
conditions, Hart said.
   After 2.5 days of hunting, Bush was ``very relaxed, very
upbeat,'' Hart said.
   While Bush was on the remote 10,000-acre ranch, his transition
office announced that he had selected Robert M. Gates, now No. 2 at
the CIA, to be the new deputy director of the National Security
Council.
   Bush, in a statement, called Gates, a long-time Soviet analyst,
``admirably suited for this key position.''
   Gates, a Kansas native and a career CIA employee, will report to
Brent Scowcroft, who Bush has designated as his national security
adviser.
   President Reagan had selected Gates in 1987 to head the CIA, but
Gates withdrew his name because of questions about his role in the
Iran-Contra affair. Gates then took the second job at CIA.
   To replace Gates, Bush chose Richard J. Kerr, the CIA's current
deputy director for intelligence whose background is in East Asian
affairs.
   Hart also said the vice president was notified in advance about
the British announcement that a bomb had caused the Pan American
Airways crash that killed 259 people over England last week.
   Bush's military attache, who accompanied the vice president to
the Lazy F Ranch, told Bush about the impending announcement, Hart
said.
   Bush had no comment on the announcement, Hart said.
   The president-elect will leave Texas on Thursday after taking a
few minutes of time for a nostaglic event at nearby Chase Naval Air
Station.
   There he will sign his wife's name, Barbara, across the fuselage
of a restored TBM Avenger, a torpedo bomber like the ones he flew in
the Pacific theater in World War II.
   Bush, a fighter pilot who escaped with his life when his plane
was shot down in the Pacific on Sept. 2, 1944, named his planes
after his wife _ then his fiancee Barbara Pierce _ during the war.
   Accompanying Bush at the signing ceremony will be Leo Nadeau of
San Diego, Calif., Bush's regular tail gunner on bombing missions.
   The plane, one of about 20 remaining of that type, was restored
by Bob Schneider of Hawkins, Texas, Hart said. After Bush signs it,
it will be transported to the naval air station at Corpus Christi,
about 70 miles away. It may then be shipped to Pensacola, Fla.
   Bush, who arrived at the Lazy F Ranch on Monday, flies to
Pintlala, Ala., outside Montgomery, Ala., on Thursday for several
hours of fishing with Ray Scott, the founder of Bass Masters.
   To squeeze in more time on Scott's private 55-acre lake, Bush
ordered his departure time moved up by about two hours Thursday.
   He has spent his vacation with Will and Sarah Farish, owners of
the Lazy F; James Baker III, the designated secretary of state, and
his wife, Susan, and his brother, Jonathan Bush of New York. Mrs.
Bush remained in Washington to pack for the move to the White House.

<TEXT>
   City officials have rejected a proposal to
name a street after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., triggering
complaints from a black alderman that the decision was a step
backward in race relations.
   The 4-2 vote Tuesday night came after about 10 people requested
that Pine Street, a residential and commercial street that runs
through the downtown area of this Mississippi River city, be named
after the slain civil rights leader.
   Mayor David Armstrong, who was among the supporters of the change
but does not vote on the board, said the city needed to show unity
between blacks and whites.
   Aldermen opposing the step said that tax rolls and property deeds
would have to be changed and businesses on the street would be
inconvenienced.
   Harden, the only black member of the six-member board, said prior
to the vote that other members were ``not interested in moving
Natchez forward. ... We're going to have problems in Natchez for the
next three or four years.''
   Alderman Freddie Biglane, who voted against the name change, said
he felt threatened that those seeking the name change were promoting
a boycott if they failed to get their way.
   At Tuesday's meeting, the citizens' group presented a report that
said the businessmen would not oppose the change.
   ``We went through something last year I hope never happens again
and I think we made a lot of strides forward in the town to do some
good things,'' Armstrong said.
   The mayor was referring to a boycott of white-owned businesses by
blacks over alleged inequities in the schools. The boycott wound
down early this year, and died out after the county superintendent
was replaced during the summer.

<TEXT>
   Top state officials Wednesday threatened to
withdraw support for the Seabrook nuclear plant if its lead owner
tries to sidestep state law and begin charging its 340,000
ratepayers for the stalled reactor.
   Public Service Company of New Hampshire filed a bankruptcy
reorganization plan Tuesday that would make it federally regulated
and no longer subject to a state law prohibiting utilities from
charging for plants before they operate commercially.
   The utility said it seeks rate increases of 30 percent to 40
percent during the next several years to cover its 36 percent stake
in Seabrook, which has been unable to obtain a license because of
emergency evacuation obstacles.
   Gov.-elect Judd Gregg said the reorganization plan amounts to
``savaging'' ratepayers ``to protect the speculators and creditors.''
   He and legislative leaders said they will try to establish a
public power authority that could take over the utility if it
pursues the plan.
   Gregg also said that if rate negotiations between the state, the
utility and its creditors are fruitless and Public Service tries to
evade state regulation, the state would reconsider its support for
Seabrook.
   ``In my opinion, everything is on the table,'' Gregg said.
   Even Gov. John Sununu, who has championed Seabrook in his six
years in office, raised that possibility.
   Sununu said the state ``ought not to exclude any alternative'' in
fighting the reorganization plan.
   Asked whether that means he may be willing to drop support for
Seabrook, Sununu said, ``I think it means having in place the
capacity to bring that particular tool to the table as one of the
bargaining chips.''
   Public Service spokesman Nicholas Ashooh replied, ``We just hope
the state would not hold New Hampshire electric consumers hostage
during these negotiations. We need that (Seabrook) power and the
state knows it.''
   ``The most productive thing is to put these threats aside and
reach an agreement,'' Ashooh said.
   Public Service sought protection from its creditors on Jan. 28
because of more than $2 billion in Seabrook debt.
   The reorganization proposal met with opposition not only from
state officials and consumers' groups, but from Public Service
creditors as well. The utilty's stock and bond prices took a beating
after the plan was disclosed.
   Public Services's plan is subject to approval by the various
parties involved and by the bankruptcy court.
   Public Service has two months before other parties in the
reorganization may offer competing plans. The utility described its
plan as an ``opening position'' for a new round of talks with its
creditors and the state.
   The state's lead negotiator, Larry Smukler, a senior assistant
attorney general, said Wednesday no talks are scheduled, but the
state is willing to negotiatate with Public Service ``when they're
willing to get serious.''

<TEXT>
   A senior aide to President Hosni Mubarak
charged on Wednesday that Israel is not serious in its efforts to
resolve the Palestinian issue and ruled out a visit by Mubarak to
Israel for the time being.
   Osama el-Baz, head of Mubarak's political office and an
undersecretary at the Foreign Ministry, dismissed Israel's latest
peace proposals as ``gimmicks'' and urged the new American
administration to pressure the Jewish state to take a more flexible
position toward peace talks.
   Speculation of a Mubarak visit boomed after he offered in two
interviews to go to Israel if that would lead to resolution of the
Palestinian issue.
   El-Baz said while Egypt had no ``objections ... inhibitions''
about holding contacts with Israel or any other party in the
interest of peace, the government did not believe in ``ceremonial
meetings.
   ``At this point, it is not in the interest of parties to have a
(summit) meeting just to argue a point here or there. This is being
done through regular channels,'' el-Baz told a news conference.
   ``For a meeting between the president and the Israeli prime
minister or any other high-ranking Israeli official to take place
and become fruitful, we must witness before holding the meeting the
realization of meaningful and tangible progress on the road to
peace.''
   In other Mideast developments Wednesday:
   _ Morris Abram, outgoing president of the prestigious Conference
of Presidents of Major American Jewish organizations, said in
Jerusalem that PLO leader Yasser Arafat should prove his interest in
peace by ordering a halt to the yearlong Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories.
   _ President Reagan sent a letter to Premier Yitzhak Shamir of
Israel, reiterating the ``unambiguous commitment of the United
States to Israel's security,'' a Shamir spokesman said. Israel radio
said the letter stressed that the U.S. decision this month to open a
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization did not mean
acceptance of the idea of an independent Palestinian state.
   _ The PLO is prepared to attend a conference in New York or
Washington on terrorism with Israel also taking part, according to
statements published in the newspaper Al-Yawm in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. Saeed Kamal, PLO representative in Egypt, was quoted as
saying such a conference would help clear the PLO's name. It was not
clear if his proposal had official PLO backing.
   Israel rejects holding talks with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist organization. It also opposes an international peace
conference on the Mideast.
   El-Baz said, ``(Israel is) presenting counterproposals that, in
our opinion, are not serious proposals for peace but rather gimmicks
that are intended to direct world attention from the real issues in
order to give the false impression that there is in effect a new
Israeli position.''
   He said reports from Israel spoke of a new peace initiative
proposed by Shamir which revolved around autonomy for Palestinians
instead of an independent state.
   El-Baz said ``the formula of autonomy ... has been superseded and
surpassed by events and by Israeli actions and policies.'' He also
said ``there is no point in holding elections (in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip) ... to set up a body to represent the Palestinians when
there is in fact a body which represents Palestinians ... It would
be a farce.''
   Shamir said Sunday that Israel would work toward an agreement
with Egypt and Jordan on self-rule for Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza, captured in the 1967 Middle East war. He said if agreement
were reached, he would allow free elections for an adminstrative
council to run Palestinian affairs in the territories.
   Egypt in 1979 became the only Arab state to sign a peace treaty
with Israel. Egypt played a major role in persuading the PLO to
adopt a more moderate stance to get the peace process moving.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's recognition of Israel's right to
exist and his renounciation of terrorism this month prompted
Washington to reverse a 13-year policy and hold official contacts
with the organization.
   El-Baz lauded the U.S. decision.
   He said Egypt expected the Bush administration to take a positive
role in preparations for an international peace conference to be
held under U.N. auspices.

   The Interior Department has pledged to keep
strip mining out of national parks and other protected federal areas
but proposed regulations aimed at ending a longstanding dispute
might allow some underground mining.
   Department officials, pointing to a policy statement released
Tuesday, said Wednesday that if anyone sought to conduct surface
coal mining in protected areas the Interior secretary would use
available authority to block the plans by obtaining the mining
rights, provided funds could be obtained from Congress.
   The policy statement, which appeared in the Federal Register with
draft regulations, was silent on underground mining.
   The draft regulations are an attempt by the department to end a
controversy over the definition of ``valid existing rights'' for
mining in areas now under federal protection.
   An undated environmental impact statement related to the issue
said that under the proposed regulations ``most owners of private
coal rights in (protected) areas would be able to establish (valid
existing rights) for underground mining, and the prohibitions (on
mining in protected areas) would not apply to them.''
   It was not immediately clear how much park and other protected
land might be subject to mining. Officials said the principal area
affected is the New River Gorge area of West Virginia, where
underground mines operated years ago and where private owners today
claim mining rights.
   The environmental statement said 315,545 acres of affected
federal land lies over coal, of which 87,383 acres is subject to
52,181 potential claims. Of that total, there were 4,033 potential
private mining claims to coal lying beneath 9,397 acres of national
park system properties and wildlife refuges.
   Congress in 1977 prohibited surface coal mining on lands, public
or private, within the boundaries of national parks and other lands
of the National Park Service, wildlife refuges, national trails,
wilderness areas, national recreation areas, wild and scenic rivers
and in certain cases, national forests.
   The prohibition did not apply to existing mines, or to holders of
``valid existing rights.'' The law did not define ``valid existing
rights,'' and the department has spent more than 11 years in and out
of court trying to do so.
   The latest attempt proposed two definitions, to be interpreted
according to state law. The department asked for comment on the
proposals during the next 70 days.
   One definition would require anyone wishing to exercise a ``valid
existing right'' to have applied for all necessary mining permits
from state authorities in 1977. That would effectively block
virtually all attempts to mine in protected areas, officials said.
   Such an interpretation is now followed in all states but West
Virginia and Illinois. In those states, current standards permit
mining if a prohibition in individual cases would amount to taking
property for which compensation would have to be paid.
   A similar definition was used nationwide before 1980. The
department required a claimant to have obtained all the necessary
permits, but federal courts said the standard was too strict and
that claimants should have to show only that they applied by the
Aug. 3, 1977, cutoff date.
   The alternative definition would require only that the miner own
the coal. This proposal leaves to state law the question of whether
the owner of the coal may disturb the surface to get at it if
somebody else owns the surface, an important question in Kentucky
where most coal has been owned in such ``split estates'' and the law
is currently unsettled.
   Under this option, most owners could mine by underground methods,
and some might be able to use surface methods, the environmental
statement said.

   Morris Abram, leader of a prestigious American
Jewish organization, demanded Wednesday that PLO leader Yasser
Arafat prove his interest in peace by ordering a halt to the
Palestinian uprising.
   ``One way or another, the violence must cease on the West Bank as
a prelude to any kind of peace process,'' Abram, outgoing president
of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
organizations, told a news conference.
   Palestinians launched their intefadeh, Arabic for uprising, in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Dec. 8, 1987, to protest 20
years of Israeli rule. Since the rebellion began, 337 Palestinians
and 14 Israelis have been killed.
   Abram said Arafat must ``prove by deeds his words'' in Geneva
this month renouncing terrorism and calling for a comprehensive
settlement among all parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict, including
in the occupied territories.
   ``Now he may do that ... by, of course, calling for a repeal of
the covenant,'' Morris said, in a reference to the charter of the
Palestine Liberation Organization which calls for elimination of
Israel.
   ``But he (Arafat) also should be expected as the representative
of his people to call off the violence, the intefadeh.''
   Abram referred to the PLO as ``a terrorist organization'' and
said he did not think it would change enough for Israel ever to open
peace talks with it.
   Seymour Reich, president of B'nai B'rith International who is to
replace Abram as conference president on Jan. 1, told reporters the
change in U.S. administrations will give Israel a needed breathing
spell to develop its own peace initiative.
   Both Abram and Reich said they were given no clues in their talks
with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other Israeli officials on
the content of a new initiative being formulated by Shamir.
   Reich, 55, has been international president of B'nai B'rith since
1986. A Harvard Law School graduate, he is a senior attorney at the
Dreyer and Traub law firm in New York. He lives with his family in
Great Neck, N.Y.

   Semtex, suspected as the material used to
destroy Pan Am Flight 103, is an odorless, orange-colored plastic
explosive and the least detectable known to terrorism experts.
   The substance is manufactured by the Eastern Bohemian Works, a
state-owned arms factory in Czechoslovakia. Terrorism experts, as
well as State Department officials, say Syria and Libya have
obtained Semtex from Czechoslovakia and passed it on to surrogate
terrorist groups.
   British authorities said Wednesday that the residue of explosives
recovered from the debris of the Boeing 747 jumbo jet in Scotland
was ``consistent with the use of a high performance plastic
explosive.'' Speculation focused on Semtex.
   The United States also manufactures plastic explosives, going
back to a substance known as C-3 at the end of World War II and a
more updated version called C-4. Other arms producing countries also
make plastic explosives.
   But Semtex is the only such substance to have defied all
detection attempts by bomb-sniffing dogs, x-ray machines and other
devices, terrorism experts say. It also has the advantage of being
stable, meaning it does not go off in uncontrolled circumstances.
   It can be placed in a suitcase and appear as a dense mass on an
x-ray operator's screen. It also can be shaped to resemble other,
innocent-looking objects. Electronic detonators can be cloaked in
calculators or other devices, experts say.

<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb made of plastic explosives blew
Pan Am Flight 103 out of the sky over Scotland, killing its 259
passengers and crew, investigators said Wednesday.
   With suspicions focusing on Middle East and Iranian terrorists,
Scotland Yard and the FBI joined forces in ``a criminal inquiry of
international dimensions,'' said John Boyd, the Lockerbie area's
chief constable.
   In a dramatic announcement in Lockerbie, the village that bore
the brunt of the jumbo jet's falling wreckage, investigators
reported ``conclusive evidence of a detonating high explosive''
aboard the jet.
   The announcement capped a week of painstaking investigation of
wreckage, baggage, bodies and cockpit recorders from the Dec. 21
crash of the Boeing 747.
   The U.S. government offered a reward of up to $500,000 for
information leading to the prosecution of anyone who caused the
crash.
   Britain's Department of Transport announced Wednesday night it
had ordered U.S. airlines using British airports to immediately
increase security, ``in particular in relation to hold baggage.''
   The department said it consulted with the Federal Aviation
Administration and that the FAA is ``also considering further
security requirements for U.S. airlines worldwide.'' A spokesman
refused to elaborate.
   The evidence was found in two parts of a ``luggage pallet'' _ the
metal rack where baggage is stored, said Michael Charles, head of
the government's Air Accidents Investigation Branch.
   ``The explosive's residues recovered from the debris have been
positively identified, and are consistent with the use of a high
performance plastic explosive,'' Charles said in a statement.
   Flight 103 left London's Heathrow Airport for New York, and a
``preliminary conclusion'' was the explosion occurred soon after the
jet crossed the Scottish border at 31,000 feet, the statement said.
   It contained no clue as to who planted the bomb, in which section
of the plane it went off, or how and where it was smuggled aboard.
   The plane's image on ground radar broke up at 7:19 p.m., 54
minutes after takeoff, and it plummeted earthward, spewing bodies
and hunks of flaming wreckage into Lockerbie and the countryside in
a 15-mile radius.
   The calamity struck so swiftly, the cockpit couldn't even
transmit a distress signal.
   Charles, who refused to answer questions, said items of wreckage
were to undergo ``lengthy chemical and metallurgical forensic
examinations.''
   ``Much investigative work remains to be done to establish the
nature of the explosive device, what it was contained in, its
location in the aircraft, and the sequence of events immediately
following its detonation,'' Charles said.
   Paul Wilkinson, a researcher on terrorism at Aberdeen University,
said in an interview the bomb was most likely planted in the forward
hold, blowing away the nose section.
   Michael Yardley, a British expert on terrorism, speculated the
bomb contained Semtex, a Czechoslovak-made high-performance
explosive British authorities say has come into Libyan hands.
   Capt. John Guntrip of Britain's Guild of Air Pilots said plastic
explosive is malleable and can be molded into innocent shapes to
beat security X-rays.
   ``You can make it as a model of an ivory head or almost anything
you can wish, so that if almost any trace was seen on a TV picture
examining the article, it would just look like an ordinary
souvenir,'' he told ITN.
   Still under investigation are three groups who callers said were
responsible. They were identified by L. Paul Bremer, who heads the
State Department's office of counter-terrorism, as the Guardians of
Islamic Revolution, the Islamic Jihad and a group of Protestant
extremists whose name he did not have.
   Ian Geldard, research director at the London-based Institute for
the Study of Terrorism, speculated the bomb was planted by
Palestinian extremists who oppose the Palestine Liberation
Organization's recent peace overtures, which include recognition of
Israel.
   Among the groups he mentioned were the Abu Nidal group; the May
15th Organization, whose bomb killed four people in a TWA jet in
1986; and Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, whose bombing of a Swissair flight in
1970 made it the first terrorist outfit to blow up an airliner in
flight.
   Geldard said a unit of the general command captured in West
Germany recently possessed bombs capable of being used on airliners.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt as a Boeing 727 and flew to
Heathrow, where it switched to a Boeing 747. West German police are
investigating whether the bomb was smuggled aboard in Frankfurt.
   Most of the passengers boarded in London, many laden with
Christmas gifts.
   At Heathrow Airport on Wednesday, the caskets of five American
victims were loaded without ceremony onto two Pan Am flights to New
York.
   They were the first bodies released for burial and were
identified as Kenneth Raymond Garczynski, 37; Om Dikshit, 55;
Dikshit's wife, Shanti Dikshit, 53; and their two grandchildren,
Suruchi Rattan, 3, and her 2-year-old brother, Anmol. Garczynski's
body arrived in New York on a separate flight.
   Authorities identified four more victims Wednesday: Michael
Joseph Doyle, 30, of Voorhees, N.J.; Robert Gerald Fortune, 40, of
New Milford, N.J.; Sean Concannon, 16, of Banbury, England; and
stewardess Noelle Lindie Berti, 41, of Paris.
   Still missing and presumed dead are 18 passengers or crew members
and 11 Lockerbie residents.
   More than 600 police and troops searched dense woods and icy,
rain-swollen waters in a 100-square-mile area Wednesday, hampered by
overnight rain and low clouds. One of the airplane's wings is
missing.
   Three men who appeared in court Wednesday on charges of stealing
parts of the airplane were released on bail for a later court
appearance. A fourth accused of theft from a house damaged in the
crash was held.

   The Reagan administration said Wednesday it was
adopting tougher airport security measures and had committed the FBI
to help British authorities find who placed a bomb aboard the Pan Am
jumbo jet that crashed last week in Scotland, killing about 270
people.
   At the same time, U.S. officials acknowledged that a week after
the disaster they had no hard leads to indicate who put the
explosive device aboard New York-bound Flight 103.
   ``We cannot at this stage put more suspicion on one group or
another,'' said L. Paul Bremer, the State Department's chief of
counter-terrorism. ``We've got to follow all the leads we've got.''
   A senior U.S. official said these covered a wide range of
potential suspects, including such radical Palestinians as the
pro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General
Command, and the pro-Libyan Abu Nidal group as well as the Guardians
of Islamic Revolution, an Iranian organization.
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S.
and British investigators had not determined what kind of bomb
caused the crash.
   That information is considered critical because terrorist groups
tend to use specific bombing methods. And yet, the official said,
``modus operandi are not conclusive because technology is
transferable.''
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General
Command is based in Syria and led by Ahmed Jibril, a former captain
of the Syrian army. It is opposed to Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The Abu Nidal group, known also as the Al Fatah Revolutionary
Council, was implicated in the 1985 airport bombings in Rome and
Vienna. Its ties to Libya contributed to the Reagan administration's
decision to bomb Tripoli, Libya, in 1986.
   The Guardians of Islamic Revolution is a pro-Khomeini group.
   ``There is no hard evidence,'' said a diplomatic source who
declined to be identified. ``But if you had to make a guess, the
Jibril group would be the logical one.''
   Bremer, meanwhile, told The Associated Press that ``what we know
is that there was a bomb on the plane. We don't know who put it
there or why. The suspicion is that it was a terrorist act. But it
also could be an act of criminal sabotage.''
   He said among the tasks confronting investigators was to find out
how the bomb got aboard Flight 103, where it was placed and what it
was made of. ``We ought to have a very open mind,'' he said. ``We
shouldn't narrow our field of inquiry until we get more evidence or
intelligence that leads us in a certain direction, so we have to
look at all groups.... There isn't any prime suspect.''
   Both President Reagan and President-elect Bush were advised of
the British government's conclusion that the Boeing 747 was bombed.
Reagan was spending the holidays in Los Angeles, and Bush was
hunting quail in Texas.
   The White House pledged ``all available resources.'' Deputy Press
Secretary Leslye Arsht said, ``We agree with the results of their
(the British) investigation.''
   The U.S. government offered a reward of up to $500,000 last week
for information leading to the prosecution of any terrorist or
saboteur who caused the crash, which killed all 259 passengers and
crew members and at least 11 residents of Lockerbie, Scotland, where
wreckage of the disintegrated jetliner fell.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, said it is
reviewing security measures taken by U.S. airlines abroad and is
``planning more stringent security requirements which will afford
additional protection to U.S. air carriers and the traveling
public.''
   The FAA in a statement did not cite specific changes that are
being planned. Agency spokesman Fred Farrar said FAA security
experts are still working out details of the new requirements, some
of which probably will not be made public.
   Much of the focus is expected to be on tightening passenger
screening and inspection of carry-on luggage and taking additional
precautions to match all baggage with boarding passengers.
   ``The incident points up the need for the international community
to adopt even more stringent air security measures,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley.
   FBI Director William B. Sessions said at a news conference that
his agency had no specific suspects and is investigating alternative
possibilities that the bomb was placed by terrorists or by criminals
targeting a specific passenger.
   ``We're looking at every single aspect,'' Sessions said. ``You
must presume it's either terrorist or criminal.''
   Mrs. Oakley said, ``We are doing everything possible and using
all available resources and sources to find out who did it. ... A
vigorous investigation is under way to determine how the explosives
were introduced into the airplane.''
   She said the United States had agreed with Finnish police in
ruling out any connection between the crash and a telephone call to
the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki earlier in the month.
   The caller said a Pan Am plane from Frankfurt, West Germany,
would be bombed by the Abu Nidal group of Palestinian extremists
implicated in airport bombings in 1985 in Rome and Vienna. Flight
103 originated in Frankfurt, with a change of planes in London.
   But George Carver, a terrorism expert with the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, said
it would be premature to rule out any terrorist group as a suspect.
He said the caller to the Helsinki may not be involved, but might
have heard reliable information since his tip preceded the bombing.
   Carver said he had no firsthand knowledge of the investigation
but that a powerful plastic bomb such as that the British government
said was used could be as small as one foot in length and one or two
inches wide and could easily be slipped inside a suitcase.
   Still under investigation are three groups who callers after the
crash said were responsible for the bombing. They were identified
last week by Bremer as the Guardians of Islamic Revolution, the
Islamic Jihad and an Ulster defense group.
   But Mrs. Oakley stressed there was no prime suspect, and in a
statement read to reporters after British authorities concluded an
explosive device caused the crash, she said the FBI was working
closely with the FAA in a search for ``further clues'' at the crash
site.
   While the British government has primary responsibility for the
investigation, Mrs. Oakley said, ``under U.S. law, the FBI also has
a responsibility to investigate the incident.''
   Sessions said the criminal end of the FBI investigation involves
talking to relatives, associates and employers of occupants of the
plane in an effort to find out whether anyone had any grudges
against passengers or crew members.
   Sessions said he had been told that the explosive used to bomb
the plane was ``like Semtex,'' described by another FBI official as
a military plastic explosive used by Soviet-bloc nations. But
Sessions stressed that the type of explosive has not been positively
identified.
   James Ronay, who heads the FBI's explosives unit, said Semtex
``is available to various criminal group and it has been used in
other incidents.'' He did not specify those incidents.

   A presidential commission put the final touches
Wednesday on a plan to close many of the nation's military bases _
perhaps two dozen or more _ and braced for local cries of anguish
over the jobs and federal dollars at stake.
   ``I expect we're going to be pretty unpopular in some areas after
this comes out,'' said Jack Edwards, the former Republican
congressman from Alabama who is co-chairman of the 12-member panel
with former Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, D-Conn.
   Edwards' panel will present its report Thursday morning to Deputy
Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV, and the closely guarded
document will then be made public.
   ``We've considered a lot of factors, but some people will be
unhappy,'' said Edwards in a recent interview.
   The panel and its 40-member staff has spent the past seven months
scrutinizing the nation's 3,800 military installations, but has
generally focused its attention on the 870 largest bases, according
to Jim Abbee, a spokesman for the commission.
   Shutting down unneeded bases is expected to save billions of
dollars a year. Pentagon estimates have ranged as high as $5 billion
annually, but Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said, ``I think $2 billion a year is a more
realistic figure.''
   Edwards said his panel had no specific targets, either in number
of bases to be closed or in dollars saved.
   ``We didn't start out with targets like that. We don't have a
goal in terms of numbers of bases closed or dollars,'' he said.
   Aspin has estimated that two dozen or more bases may be closed.
Edwards refused to confirm that figure.
   A Republican California congressman, Rep. Jerry Lewis, said he
had been told by sources that the commission will recommend the
closing of George Air Force Base, locted in the desert 70 miles
northeast of Los Angeles, and consolidation of air operations at the
state's March and Norton bases. Included in the plan, according to
Lewis, was a recommendation that the operations of the 63rd Military
Airlift Wing be shifted from Norton, in San Bernardino, to March,
which is near Riverside.
   No major installations have been closed since 1977, chiefly
because of the thicket of congressional rules and regulations
enacted to keep bases open.
   Release of the panel's report is the biggest step yet in the
complicated process set up by Congress to both close unneeded bases
and remove congressmen from the political heat that follows the lost
jobs.
   The Edwards panel was approved in the waning days of the 100th
Congress as a political compromise by legislators who wanted to
reduce the federal budget deficit and also avoid constituent
criticism.
   After receiving the report, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
will have until Jan. 15 _ five days before he leaves office _ to
accept or reject its findings. Carlucci must say yes or no to the
entire report and won't be allowed to pick or choose among bases.
   Carlucci is expected to approve the panel's recommendations,
which would send the issue back to Capitol Hill. Congress will have
until next spring to act, but it can only block the closings if both
the House and Senate pass disapproval resolutions.
   That resolution could be vetoed by George Bush, meaning that the
disapproval resolution would effectively have to pass each chamber
by a two-thirds vote, the margin required to overturn a presidential
veto.
   The panel has been lobbied heavily by worried legislators. For
example, earlier this month, Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., delivered
more than 13,000 letters from Enid, Okla., urging that Vance Air
Force Base be kept open.
   But a closed base doesn't have to mean economic disaster,
according to the Business Executives for National Security, a
private group which studies national security issues.
   ``The secret to recovering from a base closing is to start early,
start fast and keep at it,'' said Stanley A. Weiss, chairman of the
group. Weiss was the founder of American Minerals Inc.
   ``Although it's natural for a community to grieve when it loses a
major employer, it is critical to move quickly to develop a diverse
business base to replace the military presence,'' he said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ France has loaned $9 million to
Haiti, and West Germany has granted $3 million to the government to
encourage a return to democratic rule, diplomats said Wednesday.
   ``We have noticed a democratic trend in this government, and we
realize that we have to lend a helping hand if we want democracy to
come to Haiti,'' said French Embassy spokesman Jacques Fillion.
   Fillion said $7.7 million of the low-interest loan will be used
to provide a new power plant for the Haiti Cement Corp., and the
rest will be used for agricultural and hydroelectrical studies.
French aid in the past has been in the form of technical, health and
education programs.
   West Germany granted $3 million for the development of
hydroelectric energy in Haiti, said a West German diplomat, who
asked not to be identified.
   ``We are resuming this special program to encourage the current
dialogue between the Haitian government and private sectors,'' the
diplomat said. ``It is our belief that dialogue will contribute to
the transition to democracy in this country.''
   France, Haiti's former colonial ruler, has contributed $80
million in aid to Haiti since 1984. French aid was reduced after the
November 1987 election day massacre, in which thugs protected by
soldiers killed at least 36 voters.
   A soldiers' revolt on Sept. 17 ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who
came to power after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in
1986. The soldiers, demanding a return to democracy and respect for
human rights, appointed Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril as president.
   Since 1986, West Germany has granted about $25 million to Haiti,
the diplomat said.
   Haiti's largest donor, the United States, suspended $70 in direct
assistance after the 1987 election massacre. The Reagan

   Swing musician and bandleader Cab
Calloway, who collapsed during a show in Tokyo and underwent surgery
in New York, was listed in critical but stable condition Wednesday.
   Wendy Serkin, a White Plains Hospital spokeswoman, refused to
discuss the nature of the surgery but said Calloway's vital signs
were stable.
   Calloway, 81, the ``King of Hi-de-ho,'' collapsed from exhaustion
during intermission at a Dec. 21 show and was taken to Tokyo
Hospital, said his spokesman, Stan Scottland.
   He was transferred to New York on Tuesday, Scottland said.
   Calloway, who had been on a world tour, has canceled all
engagements.
   ``This is the first time ever that he has missed a performance
and the first time he has canceled a show,'' Scottland said.
``Obviously I'm worried.''
   Calloway's famous ``Hi-de-ho'' refrain was from the 1931 hit
``Minnie the Moocher,'' which he wrote with Irving Mills.
   Calloway sang it in the 1932 film ``The Big Broadcast,'' and
thrilled a new generation with it in the 1980 film ``The Blues
Brothers.''
   Calloway had his first shot at fame in the review ``Hot
Chocolates'' in 1929, but didn't achieve it until he fronted a hot
band at Harlem's legendary Cotton Club in 1931.

<HEAD>North Seeks Stay Of Order To Produce Possible Defense Testimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Oliver North on Wednesday sought
a stay of a court order requiring them to give prosecutors an
outline of possible defense testimony for North's trial in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on Friday had ruled that
independent prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh must be given a 162-page
outline of possible testimony in the trial of the former National
Security Council aide.
   Gesell had said the material must be turned over by Jan. 3.
   North's attorneys asked Gesell on Wednesday to stay the order
until an appeal or other court action can be filed.
   North's lawyers have argued that turning over the outline would
reveal their trial strategy and violate North's constitutional
rights.
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman in Walsh's office, said no court
hearing had yet been scheduled and her office had no immediate
response to the motion.
   Gesell last week set a Jan. 31 trial date for North, who is
charged with conspiring with former national security adviser John
Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard Secord to illegally divert more than $12 million in
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The four are to be tried separately, with North's trial scheduled
first.

   The government ordered all U.S. airlines using
British airports to tighten security immediately Wednesday night,
especially in handling baggage stored in the luggage compartments of
aircraft.
   The Department of Transport said the directive was made after
consultation with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which it
said was ``also considering further security requirements for U.S.
airlines worldwide.''
   Its decision came hours after investigators announced a bomb made
of powerful plastic explosives caused the Dec. 21 crash of Pan Am
Flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing all 259
people on board the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground.
   Officials said evidence of the explosion was found in wreckage
from the Boeing 747's cargo hold.
   A brief Department of Transport statement said: ``We have
reviewed the security arrangements for flights by U.S. carriers in
the light of this incident, in consultation with the FAA, and are
immediately directing U.S. airlines to take additional measures in
Britain, in particular in relation to hold baggage.
   A spokesman, who by custom was not identified, refused to
elaborate or give any details on the additional security measures it
wants taken.
   The announcement followed calls by British lawmakers and aviation
experts for increased security following the crash, the worst
aviation disaster in British history.
   ``The question that now has to be asked is how and where did a
bomb get on board?,'' said David Wilshire, an aviation expert and
lawmaker from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's governing
Conservative Party.
   Wilshire said there were three sources of passengers on the
flight: those who got on at Frankfurt where the flight originated;
those who joined at Heathrow Airport; and 12 in transit from other
flights.
   ``We are not therefore just talking about Heathrow or
Frankfurt,'' he said.
   The luggage of the 12 transit passengers went through the
Heathrow security system but luggage belonging to the Frankfurt
passengers did not, although it was transferred under supervision of
Pan Am guards, he said.
   Opposition lawmakers have protested angrily that the Department
of Transport never informed British airports or travelers about a
U.S. warning of a terrorist threat to bomb a Pan Am airliner on the
Frankfurt-New York route in December.
   The government said that after receiving the threat, it had
reviewed security for U.S. flights at British airports _ which
already is higher than for some other destinations _ and decided it
was adequate.
   John Prescott, the opposition Labor Party's transport spokesman,
said he had written to Mrs. Thatcher demanding an independent
investigation into the Department of Transport's handling of airport
security, which he called inadequate, and the U.S. government
warning, which he claimed the department had ``largely ignored.''

   A policy on police chases was under review
at the time of the city's third fatal hot-pursuit crash this month,
a fiery accident that killed five family members, the police chief
said Wednesday.
   The chase Tuesday night ended when a car fleeing from police at
80 mph ran a red light and crashed into another car.
   Police Chief Dwight Joseph said the review came at the request of
City Councilwoman Cynthia Cecil Lazarus and was prompted by the
deaths of two people in hot-pursuit crashes earlier in December.
   Mrs. Lazarus was reported to be out of town Wednesday and
unavailable for comment.
   In Tuesday's accident, police began chasing the car seconds
before the crash when officers spotted the vehicle speeding. The
second car was cut in two and exploded, and its five occupants
burned to death, police said.
   In the earlier accidents, a stolen car being chased by police ran
a red light and hit another car, killing one of its occupants, and a
car being chased for traffic violations hit two utilty poles,
killing a passenger.
   Joseph said the department's crash policy, redrafted two years
ago, was followed in all three chases this month.
   The new policy recommended limiting the number of police cars
involved in a chase to two, unless a supervisor orders more;
prohibiting officers from engaging in pursuits when a suspect or
civilian is in their car, and allowing only marked cars with lights
and sirens to participate in chases.
   The victims were tentatively identified Wednesday as Earl
Maynard, 39; his wife, Connie Maynard, 37; their son, Marty Maynard,
10; Connie's mother, Edna Cox, 64; and Ms. Cox's foster son, David
Morris, 26, said officer Paul Hillenbrand. The driver of the
speeding car, Emmett Gabriel, 30, was listed in poor condition
Wednesday at Grant Medical Center with head, arm and chest injuries.
   No charges were immediately filed.
   Each chase is different, and no policy can be written to cover
every possibility, said Lt. John Carruthers, who teaches a class on
hot pursuit and use of force.
   The decision of whether to conduct a high-speed chase often must
be made in a split second, and an officer must be both calm and
trained in weighing the value of an arrest against the danging, Carruthers
said.
   Officers are trained to use ``slow pursuit'' techniques that
allow them to capitalize on the suspect's driving mistakes, NAPD
director Rocky Coltellaro said in a telephone interview.
   Joseph said officers also are taught to use ``slack'' pursuit _
if police slow down, violators often do so as well.
   ``Pursuits have been an issue for some time,'' Carruthers said.
``They've been identified as a high-liability area for policing, and
any time you've had a series of incidents, it focuses that much more
attention.''

<HEAD>GAO Study Says Criteria For Veterans' Disability Benefits Are
Outdated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many disabled veterans may be over- or
under-compensated for their injuries because the Veterans
Administration is using outdated medical data, a congressional study
reported Wednesday.
   The use of outdated medical standards could mean the difference
of hundreds of dollars each month to some veterans, the General
Accounting Office said in recommending that the VA perform a
comprehensive review of its standards.
   The VA paid about $14.3 billion in disability benefits to about
3.8 million veterans and their survivors in 1987, said the GAO, the
investigative branch of Congress.
   The various parts of the disability rating schedule have been
updated individually, but there has been no comprehensive look at
the schedule since 1945.
   As a result, the report said, some medical conditions are not
listed in the schedule, which means a VA rating specialist must use
his or her own judgment to classify the disability.
   ``VA cannot ensure that veterans are given accurate and uniform
disability ratings because the rating schedule has not been adjusted
to incorporate the results of many recent medical advances,'' the
study said.
   ``It is inherently difficult to achieve uniform and accurate
administration of this type of program; out-of-date rating schedules
make it almost impossible,'' according to the rent to 56 of the 58 VA
regional offices to be classified.
   In one case, a veteran with hypertensive heart disease was
assigned five different ratings, ranging from 10 percent disability
to 100 percent. Twenty-five rating boards gave him a 30 percent
disability, or $202 per month in benefits, and 21 boards gave him 60
percent, or $516 in benefits.
   In another case, a veteran with post traumatic stress disorder
was rated from zero to 70 percent disabled by the various boards,
which would have meant anywhere from no benefits to $410 a month,
the report said.
   In a GAO survey of 383 VA rating specialists, 61 percent said it
was ``somewhat likely'' or ``very likely'' that in rating mental
disorders, they could reach two or more rating percentages with the
same medical evidence.
   Fifty-one percent said the same situation could occur in rating
neurological and convulsive disorders, and for all types of illness,
22 percent said it was likely to reach more than one conclusion with
the same medical evidence.

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita was jolted by a new
setback in Japan's stock-profiteering scandal hours after he
promised reform measures in a nationally televised news conference
Wednesday.
   Takeshita, under growing attack over the scandal, pledged to give
top priority to changes in fund-raising methods by politicians and
in the nation's election system.
   But early Thursday his newly appointed justice minister,
76-year-old Takashi Hasegawa, reversed a statement he made two days
earlier and admitted that his individual campaign organization
received funds from Recruit Co., the information-employment
conglomerate at the center of the storm.
   The development was expected to foil Takeshita's plans to revive
public support with his reshuffle on Tuesday of a Cabinet tainted by
the scandal.
   Takeshita told the news conference, ``Solving the Recruit
incident is a current problem, but I believe that prosecution
officials will take suitable action.''
   Despite a major drop in support indicated by public opinion
polls, he ruled out any plans to dissolve the Diet, Japan's
parliament, and call an election for both houses next summer, when
an upper house election is scheduled.
   Hasegawa, charged with overseeing the scandal investigation, told
reporters his political support organization received about $46,000
in donations over the past 12 years from Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and
former chairman of Recruit.
   Only Tuesday, Hasegawa said after his Cabinet appointment, ``I
have nothing to do (with Recruit) and that's why I can appear before
you.''
   Takeshita said Wednesday he chose Hasegawa because he headed a
parliamentary ethics committee and was the ``most trustworthy.''
   Both men belong to the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   In the scandal, influential politicians and businessmen were
offered bargain-priced unlisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos, a real
estate company and a Recruit subsidiary, and profited after the
shares were put up for public sale.
   After the scandal widened and Liberal Democrats pushed a
controversial tax reform package through Parliament, a poll this
month by the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun indicated the Takeshita
government's approval rating tumbling to 18 percent from 30 percent
when he took office in November 1987.
   Media commentaries said Takeshita failed to address the political
ethics issue.
   ``Basically, each politician, including myself, must always (take
into account) an ethical platform,'' Takeshita said. ``But it is
first necessary to create the environment to make this possible.''
   He said formation Tuesday of a new party committee on ethics was
one step toward creating that environment.
   The group, headed by former Cabinet Secretary Masaharu Gotoda,
will be asked to review the law allowing politicians to collect
tax-free political funds. It also will draw up short- and
medium-range goals for overhauling the election system, Takeshita
said.
   He called for a correction in the imbalance of electoral seats.
Since a 1950s population explosion in the cities, rural districts _
a stronghold of the governing party _ have had disproportionately
large representation in the Diet.
   A parliamentary political reform committee and another group
answering to the prime minister also will join in mapping goals to
mark the 100th anniversary of the election system in July 1990,
Takeshita said.
   He said the dormant Election System Council, consisting of
officials, academics and other experts, will be resurrected so ``the
government, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Diet can form one
body and begin laying the foundation (for political reform) as soon
as possible in the New Year.''
   Meanwhile, Hasegawa was to lead an investigation of corruption in
government, centered around the Recruit scandal.
   Takeshita himself had an aide who profited in the Recruit
transactions, but the prime minister has denied any personal
involvement.
   The transactions are not illegal, but they are regarded as
unethical. Opposition parties charge that political favors were
granted in exchange.

<TEXT>
   Anger, vengeance and a desire to prevent similar deaths in the
future were among feelings expressed Wednesday by some family
members of the 259 people killed when a bomb exploded on Pan Am
Flight 103.
   One man who lost his son wanted revenge against whoever is
responsible for the Dec. 21 crash of the Boeing 747 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, and others just wanted a way to rationalize what happened
to their loved ones.
   Authorities in Lockerbie, the village that bore the brunt of the
jumbo jet's falling wreckage, announced Wednesday ``conclusive
evidence of a detonating high explosive'' aboard the jetliner.
   After the crash it emerged that U.S. authorities had been warned
of a terrorist threat to bomb a Pan Am airliner on the Frankfurt-New
York route in December. Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, West
Germany.
   ``I feel that every passenger on that plane should have been
given the same warning as diplomats,'' said Susan Cohen, whose
daughter Theodora, 20, was among 35 Syracuse University students
killed. ``They know how to differentiate between safe and real
threats.
   ``In those cases where it's serious, security should be heavy,''
Mrs. Cohen said. ``Every piece of luggage should be inspected by
hand. Why didn't they? I'll tell you why. Money.
   ``We cannot allow greed to endanger the lives of American
citizens. My baby will never come back. I will fight with every
breath to see this never happens to another mother,'' she said.
   The father of Syracuse University student Karen Hunt, 20, also
called for stricter security measures.
   ``We just hope that somehow, someone _ whether it's our
government working with other governments _ something has to be done
to protect people,'' Hunt said. ``Innocent people should at least be
given the opportunity to avoid additional threats to their
security.''
   W.W. Coursey of Faulkville, Ga., whose son, U.S. Army Sgt. W.
Larry Coursey, was on the flight, said the news ``didn't surprise me
one bit. I had my feelings about it all the time.''
   Coursey said whatever country or party is determined to be
responsible for the bombing ``should be wiped out.''
   ``We should not be going over there and pat them on the back _
just put a stop to it,'' he said. ``It don't take but about once or
twice like that before you don't find this kind of mess happening. I
hate to be hard-nosed about it, but that's the way I feel.''
   In Melrose, Mass., Len Colasanti, father of 20-year-old Gary
Colasanti, another Syracuse University student, heard the news while
preparing for his son's funeral.
   ``If it were an act of God it would be easier for us to accept,''
Colasanti said. ``The fact that it was a terrorist act makes it much
more difficult to accept Gary's loss.''
   In St. Louis Park, Minn., Robert Rappaport, a cousin of victim
Judith Ellen Bernstein, said he was not surprised authorities had
determined a bomb was planted on the plane.
   ``Things that are going on in the world today are so complicated
that nothing makes sense to me anymore,'' he said.
   Rappaport said that when an Iranian jet was shot down last
summer, he thought ``how horrible. You never think that it could
touch you. And it did.''
   ``That sort of thing is more than we can deal with,'' added Sally
Pitt of South Hadley, Mass., mother of victim James Pitt, 24.

   Country music star Johnny Cash's
condition was upgraded Wednesday to satisfactory at the hospital
where he underwent double bypass surgery last week.
   Despite his continuing improvement, the 56-year-old ``man in
black'' will probably be hospitalized for another week or so, said
Baptist Hospital spokeswoman Aileen Katcher.
   ``He will remain in the intensive care unit until next week for
observation,'' she said, and probably be released sometime next week.
   Ms. Katcher said the precaution is not standard in such cases,
but is not unusual either.
   Generally speaking, Cash ``is doing a lot better,'' she said
Wednesday. ``He was up and walking around again today.''
   Before Wednesday, Cash's condition had been critical but stable.
   Cash began having lung problems over the weekend after the
surgery, but Ms. Katcher said they were under control.
   Cash is best known for his songs ``A Boy Named Sue,'' ``I Walk
the Line'' and ``Ring of Fire.''

<HEAD>National Enquirer Stands Behind Engelbert AIDS Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Enquirer, named in a $50
million-plus libel lawsuit filed by Engelbert Humperdinck, is
standing behind an article stating his daughter's mother fears the
entertainer ``is battling the AIDS virus.''
   ``The article, written and researched with extreme care, was
based on court papers filed in New York's family Court,'' the
tabloid said Wednesday in a statement from its Lantana, Fla.,
headquarters.
   ``The headline, `Mother of His Child Claims in Court ...
Engelbert Has AIDS Virus,' is totally accurate,'' the statement
said, adding, ``It was published only after being closely reviewed
by our legal counsel.''
   The weekly supermarket tabloid, which boasts the largest
circulation of any paper in America, published the story in its
issue dated Dec. 27.
   Humperdinck, a pop singer, sued Tuesday, contending the tabloid
report was false and malicious. The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court
by Humperdinck lawyer Robert Rotstein, states the entertainer
doesn't have acquired immune deficiency syndrome and has never
tested positive for AIDS.
   Federal health officials estimate that up to 1.5 million
Americans have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus,
and of that total, 20 to 30 percent will develop AIDS by the end of
1991.
   Kathy Jetter filed papers in New York City's Family Court
demanding that Humperdinck, 52, provide for the financial future of
her 12-year-old daughter, already ruled by a court to be his
daughter.
   Humperdinck's libel lawsuit said the woman's unsubstantiated and
false claims about the entertainer in a reply affidavit in the case
were ultimately dismissed by the New York court.

<HEAD>Activist Says Sakharov Mediator In Armenia-Azerbaijan Tensions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Armenian activist saying
Sakharov helped mediate Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict when he
traveled to the republics this month. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Armenian activist said Thursday that human
rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov tried to help resolve the dispute
between Armenia and Azerbaijan when he traveled to the two southern
republics earlier this month.
   Rafael Popoyan, a former political prisoner and literary critic,
said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may have asked Sakharov to go,
though he was ostensibly on a trip to inspect a controversial
nuclear power plant.
   ``They (Armenians) say Gorbachev sent him, but I can't say one
way or the other,'' the activist said, speaking by telephone from
the Armenian capital Yerevan.
   Sakharov's wife and fellow human rights activist, Yelena Bonner,
said Wednesday that she accompanied him on a trip to Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, the region at the heart of the
dispute. But she declined to confirm reports Sakharov was shuttling
between the two republics to calm ethnic tensions.
   Popoyan said the 67-year-old physicist and Nobel Peace Prize
winner held meetings at the republic's Academy of Sciences, at a
center for Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan and with Armenia's
Communist Party chief, Suren Arutunyan. Details of the meetings were
not known, he said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, asked about the
trip at a briefing, said, ``As far as I know he went there as a
member of a group of academics and scholars. That trip had nothing
to do with any authority whatsoever.''
   The official Soviet media carried no reports on Sakharov
traveling to the region.
   Armenians want to annex the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is
predominantly ethnic Armenian and Christian. Azerbaijan is
predominantly Moslem.
   Curfews are in effect in parts of Armenia and Azerbaijan but
tension is reported to be lower than it was a month ago when at
least 31 people died in ethnic violence.
   While in the United States last month, Sakharov spoke out in
defense of Armenians in the dispute and was criticized for his
statements in articles published in the official Azerbaijani press.
   During his U.S. visit, the New York-based International League
for Human Rights issued a statement from Sakharov endorsing its call
for United Nations observers to investigate the ethnic unrest.
   Popoyan said Sakharov, his wife and at least one other envoy
traveled to Yerevan, the Azerbaijani capital Baku and
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In Nagorno-Karabakh, the group met with the Soviet leadership's
point man in the ethnic dispute, Arkady Volsky, according to
Popoyan. It appeared the group's reason for visiting the region was
to review conditions at a controversial nuclear power plant near
Yerevan, Popoyan said. Sakharov is on the board of the prestigous
Soviet Academy of Sciences, which the leadership has asked to look
at the power plant.
   Many Armenians feared the plant was damaged in the Dec. 7
earthquake that devastated the northwestern part of their republic.
But Soviet officials have repeatedly said the plant, located on a
geological fault, was not damaged. Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov has
said the plant will be closed in two years because of the earthquake
danger.
   If it is confirmed Gorbachev backed the mission, it would be a
highly unusual step for the Kremlin to tap a longtime dissident to
try to help settle one of its most stubborn problems.
   Sakharov's official standing has improved dramatically since
Gorbachev took power. He was banished to the industrial city of
Gorky from 1980 to 1986 because of his outspoken opposition to
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. It was Gorbachev who allowed
Sakharov to return to Moscow, and whose government has given the
human rights activists space in the official press to express his
views.
   While the Kremlin sought new ways to quell the ethnic unrest, the
Soviet Supreme Court, in directives published Wednesday, set
guidelines for a possible crackdown on activists who stirred up
ethnic feelings.
   The news agency Tass said the court defined who may be tried
under a law against whipping up ethnic tensions. Conviction carries
a possible jail term of six months to three years.
   The court said firing or refusing to hire workers, violation of
voting rights or depriving people of housing for ethnic reasons also
should be punishable, Tass reported.

   A college teacher who says he was only
relaying a letter he found on the floor of an American Airlines jet
was charged Wednesday with making a bomb threat that forced the
plane to make an unscheduled landing.
   Peter M. Canning, 40, a lecturer at the University of California
at Berkeley, was charged with violating a federal law concerning
bomb threats made on board aircraft.
   The letter was handed to a flight attendant on Flight 240 from
San Francisco to Dallas on Tuesday night. The pilot diverted the
Boeing 767 to Albuquerque International Airport, where it was put on
a remote stretch of runway and the 198 passengers evacuated.
   No bomb was found.
   Canning appeared before U.S. Magistrate Sumner Buell, who
released him on his own recognizance.
   The FBI said Canning handed a flight attendant a note that said:
``Read this. There are guns pointed at you. If you want to live,
read the letter underneath and do what it says. This is a bomb
scare. Read this. PS If you do what the letter says, and have
everyone else do it, you will live. PS If you don't, you are
history!! There are bombs planted all over this airplane and there
is a gun pointed at your head. Take your wallet and throw it in the
aisle now.''
   The FBI asked Canning to provide them with a handwriting sample
so they could compare it to the note.
   ``A comparison of his (handwriting) and the note once again
resulted in similarities which seemed apparent to special agents
involved in this investigation,'' the complaint said.
   Canning's attorney, Ray Twohig, said the incident was a mistake.
   ``This man found a note and gave it to a flight attendant and,
because of some confusion on the part of the FBI, this charge was
filed,'' Twohig said. ``I expect the case to be dropped within a
week.''
   A friend of Canning's, Rhonda Lieberman, said Canning had been
flying to New Orleans for a convention of the Modern Language
Association.
   She said Canning is a native of Waterbury, Conn., who did his
undergraduate work at Northeastern University in Boston. He then
spent about five years at Harvard Universiry earning his doctorate
and a year studying at the University of Paris, two years at Yale,
and then two years at Berkeley.
   If convicted, Canning could face a maximum sentence of five years
in prison and $250,000 fine, Buell said.
   No trial date was set.

<TEXT>
   After 15 years of court-ordered busing that
triggered violent opposition and white flight, the city has approved
a school assignment plan of its own in hopes of salvaging the
troubled Boston public school system.
   The plan would allow parents to shop around for a school closer
to home, reducing the long bus rides many students now endure each
day.
   Devised by consultants to the city School Department, the plan
was endorsed in principle by the School Committee Wednesday night.
The board approved the plan as the general framework for a new
student assigment plan and directed the superintendent to develop
recommendations for implementing it.
   The panel voted that at least part of the new assignment plan be
in place by September 1989. But officials said they did not yet know
which part of the plan that would be.
   School Committee member Thomas O'Reilly hailed the plan as ``for
Bostonians, by Bostonians.''
   ``Essentially, what it leads to is the School Committee taking
responsibility after 14 years of not having that responsibilty in
the way we assign our children to schools,'' O'Reilly said.
   The vote was 10 to 1, with two members abstaining. Those not
voting in favor said the proposal leaves too many questions, such as
whether money will be allocated to upgrade unpopular schools. They
also said more review of the plan was necessary before taking a vote.
   Backers hope the resulting competition between schools will spur
improvements and perhaps lure back some of the white students who
fled to private schools or the suburbs when the desegregation order
was imposed in 1974 amid rock-throwing protests.
   ``We've put that kind of violence and racial strain behind us,''
said John P. Grady, a School Committee member from a working-class,
racially diverse neighborhood. ``We want all of our children to have
the best education we can give them. As a city, we've grown up.''
   The plan, devised by consultants hired by the city School
Department, was expected to win approval in some form at a School
Committee meeting Wednesday night.
   Court-ordered desegregation was spurred by a 1972 lawsuit filed
by black parents who claimed their children were receiving
lower-quality education than that at predominantly white schools.
   In 1975, U.S. District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. imposed a
busing plan after finding the city deliberately kept the schools
segregated. Since then, parents have had little choice in which
schools their children attend.
   At the time the lawsuit was filed, the public schools served
96,000 students, 60 percent of whom were white. Today, there are
59,000 students, and only 24 percent are white, though whites make
up 60 percent of the city's population. Forty-eight percent of the
students are black, 19 percent Hispanic and 8 percent Asian.
   As a result, some of Boston's schools have in effect been
resegregated, with nearly 90 percent of their pupils members of
minority groups, Grady said.
   Garrity returned some control over the system to the School
Committee in 1985. In 1987, a federal appeals court ruled that
Boston schools had integrated and that increased minority influence
would prevent a return to segregated classrooms.
   Garrity has since left the bench, but his orders in the case
require only that a racial balance be maintained, freeing the School
Committee to come up with a plan of its own.
   Any change in the student assignment plan would require approval
by the state Board of Education, which is expected.
   The new plan applies to kindergarten through eighth grade and
would take effect in the fall, said Ian Forman, a School Department
spokesman. A similar plan for high schools is expected to come
before the School Committee this spring.
   The plan would split the system into three zones of 14,000 pupils
each, with parents permitted to choose any school within their zone,
Forman said.
   Children would be sent to the school of their choice provided it
did not upset the school's racial balance. A lottery would be held
for schools that were oversubscribed.
   The plan is supported by Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, who once was a
fervent busing foe, and Superintendent Laval S. Wilson.
   But some are unconvinced that the plan will solve the school
system's woes, which include rundown buildings, a perennial budget
crunch and a 40 percent high school dropout rate.
   City Councilor James M. Kelly, who has opposed the desegregation
plan for 15 years, said the new plan still denies parents what they
have always wanted: clean neighborhood schools staffed with
dedicated teachers.
   ``It's a slight improvement over the original court orders,'' he
said, ``but anyone with enough money to provide alternative
education for their children will do so, just as they have for the
past 14 years.''
   Hattie KcKinnis, executive director of the Citywide Parents
Council, said it matters little where children attend school if they
do not learn there.
   Fifteen years after Garrity's desegregation order, she said,
``Parents are still looking for the light at the end of the tunnel
as far as the quality of education is concerned. That's what it was
supposed to have been about in the first place, and that has not
been achieved.
   ``Good schools require money, and parents wonder where it is
going to come from,'' she said.

   About 120 protesters were arrested
Wednesday when they blocked the entrances to an abortion clinic.
   The protesters were among 200 who gathered outside the Hartford
Gynecological Center.
   Police Chief Bernard Sullivan said those arrested were charged
with creating a public nuisance, a charge that requires a court
appearance and a potential fine but no jail time.
   Patients were sent to other clinics for a brief time, said Monica
Krikorian, the clinic's co-administrator.
   Protest organizers said they are loosely affiliated with
Operation Rescue, a Binghamton, N.Y.-based organization that has
staged demonstrations in dozens of U.S. cities since last summer,
resulting in more than 9,000 arrests.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir received a letter
from President Reagan Wednesday backing Israel and but also saying
U.S. talks with the PLO can encourage pragmatism among Palestinians,
a spokesman and Israel radio reported.
   Shamir praised the letter but said the U.S. decision this month
to open a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization was
``not a just step,'' Israel radio reported.
   Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, said Reagan's letter
reiterated the ``unambiguous commitment of the United States to
Israel's security.''
   The letter stressed that the U.S. decision to begin direct
contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization did not imply
acceptance of the concept of an independent Palestinian state,
Israel radio reported.
   ``The message of the president was excellent, but nevertheless I
think that the last step by the U.S. administration was not a just
step,'' Shamir said. ``It is known that we oppose this move and we
hope they end the contacts.''
   Reagan wrote that talks with the PLO could encourage realism
among the Palestinian leadership and contribute to a solution of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, Israel radio reported.
   A year-old uprising by Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip has left more than 330 Palestinians and 14 Israelis dead.
   Shamir says talking with the PLO will only encourage extremism.
   ``The last American decision to have talks with the PLO
encouraged the tendency of violent acts against Israel,'' Shamir
said.
   The U.S. last held talks with the PLO in 1975.
   ``We have no illusions about the PLO. We shall judge this group
according to its deeds and its renunciation of terrorism,'' Israel
radio quoted Reagan's letter as saying.
   The president said the United States remains committed to its
``war against terrorism in all its forms,'' the radio reported.
   Ahimeir said ``the president reiterated the unambiguous
commitment of the United States to Israel's security.'' He would not
elaborate, saying he did not have the text of the letter.
   William A. Brown, the new U.S. ambassador to Israel, flew into
Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv from Paris on
Wednesday to assume his post.
   Brown served in Israel from 1979-82 as deputy head of mission
under Ambassador Samuel Lewis and was ambassador to Thailand from
1985-88.
   Brown, accompanied by his wife Helen, declined to answer
reporters' questions. He said he will not formally present his
credentials to President Chaim Herzog until Thursday, when he was
also scheduled to meet Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   Brown, 58, of Hillsboro, N.H., succeeds Thomas Pickering, the new
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

<HEAD>Official Says Canada Will Need Adjustment Programs for Unemployed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior labor official told senators on Wednesday
that Canada will need huge adjustment programs to protect workers
whose jobs will disappear because of the Canada-U.S. free trade
accord.
   Dick Martin, executive vice president of the Canadian Labor
Congress, also said the government should have included a ``social
charter'' in the pact to protect Canadian working conditions in the
face of competition from lower-wage areas of the United States.
   Martin suggested in his remarks before the Senate foreign affairs
committee that Canadian companies would either have to cut workers'
benefits or face the loss of markets under the free trade agreement,
which will eliminate all tariff barriers between the two countries
over a 10-year period.
   Committee members are studying the free-trade legislation prior
to its expected passage this week.
   The Senate is expected to pass the free trade legislation before
the accord is to go into effect Jan. 1. Canada's House of Commons
approved it last weekend and the U.S. Congress ratified agreement
earlier this year.
   Another witness, Judith Maxwell, head of the Economic Council of
Canada, said the committee should not exaggerate the negative
aspects of the agreement.
   She said that the net impact will be positive in terms of jobs
and any adjustment programs should focus on workers, not companies.
   She said those programs should be broad, since there will be no
way of knowing when jobs are lost whether the loss had anything to
do with free trade.
   Programs should be aimed at disadvantaged workers, those who are
elderly, have limited education or skills or live in remote
communities, she added.
   In his testimony, Martin complained that his Canadian Labor
Congress was never invited to join a committee set up by Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney to look into what labor adjustment programs,
if any, would be needed to help workers hurt by the trade agreement.
   He said the Congress, the major umbrella labor organizaton in
Canada, still would participate under certain conditions.
   It must be assured that the free-trade labor adjustment group was
serious about putting in place programs to help workers hurt by the
trade deal and that the group would not be limited by concerns about
government deficit, he said.
   The labor adjustment committee has done little since it was
formed and is not expected to report until spring.
   Jean de Grandpre, the labor adjustment committee chairman, and
Trade Minister John Crosbie are to appear before the
Liberal-dominated Senate committee Thursday.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge signed an
order Wednesday formally selling the PTL ministry's assets to a
Toronto real estate investor for $65 million.
   Buyer Stephen Mernick has 11 days to come up with a $3.25 million
deposit. If all goes as planned, in 41 days, Mernick would assume
the administration and operation of PTL's headquarters, which
includes a Christian theme park and satellite television studios.
   Judge Rufus Reynolds, who signed the order in his Greensboro
office, approved the offer Dec. 13 in bankruptcy court in Columbia,
S.C.
   But the Rev. Sam Johnson, pastor of Heritage Village Church at
PTL and president of Heritage Ministries, told The Charlotte
Observer that he hasn't given up his hope to buy PTL's headquarters
in Fort Mill, S.C.
   Charlotte broadcasting executive Cy Bahakel also may contest the
sale. Bahakel claimed he wasn't given a fair chance to beat
Mernick's bid, and his lawyer, Faison Barnes, said two weeks ago
Bahakel would appeal the order.
   On Wednesday, Barnes declined to say whether Bahakel would follow
through with an appeal. ``We have to see the order itself to know
exactly what we plan to do,'' he said.
   The order is expected to be filed Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Columbia.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy court since June 1987, three months
after former leader Jim Bakker resigned in a sex and money scandal.
   Mernick, an Orthodox Jew, has said he is willing to deal with
Heritage Ministries about keeping alive Christian broadcasting on
the PTL satellite television network. He said in October that he was
interested in PTL as a real estate deal.
   The network, carried on more than 800 cable systems, is among
PTL's most valued assets. Other assets include 1,700 undeveloped
acres in South Carolina just south of Charlotte; two 500-room
hotels, one of them unfinished; and a water park.
   Once Mernick pays the balance of the $65 million, the money would
be distributed to PTL's creditors.

   A factory roof fell apart during a windy
rainstorm Wednesday, killing two people crushed by debris,
authorities said.
   Police said no other injuries were reported after the cornice and
parapet of the Baxter, Kelly and Frost Tool and Die Co. came apart
about 4:45 p.m. Police and rescue workers had searched through the
falled chunks of concrete Wednesday night looking for victims who
might have been trapped.
   A witness whose parked car was demolished, the Rev. Robert
Falkenstein, said the victims were a man and a woman in their cars,
apparently ready to leave the north Philadelphia area.
   ``They just got out of work,'' he said. ``Their cars were running
... another minute or two and they would have been gone.
   Falkenstein was standing across the street when the collapse
occurred.
   ``We looked up and saw the tons of bricks falling down,'' he said.
   Police at the scene said the collapse may have been caused by
wind, but no official determination was made by Wednesday night.
   A police photographer, who declined to give his name, said four
cars, including Falkenstein's, were damaged by the collapse.
   The photographer said the tool and die company was operating
Wednesday, but there was no word on whether people were inside at
the time of the collapse.
   The names of the dead were withheld pending notification of
family members, authorities said.

   The United States and the 12-nation European

the issue of whether American meat which contains growth hormones
constitutes a health threat.
   Both sides are locked in an acrimonious dispute which threatens
to spill over into other areas of trade between America and its
European allies. Two-way trade between the United States and the
European Community totals $150 billion annually.
   On Tuesday, the Reagan administration vowed to impose $100
million worth of trade sanctions against European food products,
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1.
   The 100 percent duties will effectively double the wholesale
price at the U.S. border for such popular products as hams, canned
Italian tomatoes and imported wine coolers.

   Economic illiteracy is rampant among America's
high school students, according to a first-of-its-kind survey that
found only a dismal one in three was able to define simple concepts
like inflation or profits.
   Results of the survey, involving 8,205 11th- and 12th-grade
students in public and private high schools in 33 states, were to be
released today at a news conference featuring Paul A. Volcker,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board from 1979 to 1987.
   It found only 34 percent taking a multiple-choice exam in
economics, popularly known as the ``dismal science,'' were able to
correctly define profits as ``revenues minus costs.''
   And just 39 percent selected the correct definition of Gross
National Product: ``the market value of the nation's output of final
goods and services.''

   If you go on a job interview today and are
asked to take a lie detector test, the chances are you would be the
victim of an illegal act.
   The same situation applies if your boss has a polygraph examiner
come into the warehouse tomorrow to hook wires to randomly selected
employees and question them about merchandise missing from the
company's shelves.
   It is now illegal across America for most employers in interstate
commerce to use the controversial polygraph for pre-employment
screening purposes or to use them randomly against workers already
on their payroll.
   These restrictions on lie detectors, whose accuracy has long been
under attack, are enumerated in a federal law that took effect
Tuesday, six months after it was signed by President Reagan.

   Oscar-winner Hal Ashby, who directed the
1970s classics ``Coming Home,'' ``Being There'' and ``Harold and
Maude,'' is dead at age 59.
   Ashby died of liver cancer at his home Tuesday as he was
preparing to direct a film of Truman Capote's ``Hand Carved
Coffins,'' said his business manager, Larry Reynolds.
   Colleagues praised Ashby as a director who created visually
striking images, gave his star actors and fanciful stories the
stage, while he graciously disappeared into the shadows.
   Along with ``Coming Home,'' the anti-war Vietnam story starring
Jane Fonda and Jon Voight, Ashby turned out a string of highly
individualistic and idiosyncratic hits during the 1970s. They
included ``Shampoo,'' ``The Last Detail,'' ``Harold and Maude,''
``Being There'' and ``Bound for Glory.''

   More than 20 years ago, in another time and distant place, U.S.
Marines trudged through the monsoons, mud and shellfire of the
killing fields of Vietnam.
   Many just out of high school, they fought from Khe Sanh, where
they withstood a bloody 77-day siege, to the streets of Hue, where
emperors once sat, and Dong Ha, a dingy frontier town shelled so
much the Marines called it ``Rocket City.''
   One battalion, the 11th Marines, 3rd Marine Division, helped
plant about 100,000 land mines to protect a string of U.S. outposts
along the 17th parallel that then divided Vietnam into North and
South.
   Now as the New Year begins, six former Marines are going on a
sentimental, bittersweet patrol into the past, to places halfway
around the world once known on war maps as Cam Lo, Con Thien and Gio
Linh, to walk again those battlefields of their youth and to look
into the eyes of the once faceless enemy.
   Concerned that many of the mines they buried in the ground are
still in place and still a threat, the ex-Marines are returning to
try to verify Vietnamese claims that the explosives have been
removed.
   Gene Spanos, 39, now a Rosemont, Ill., police lieutenant,
organized the mission.
   Other former members of the 11th Marines making the journey are
Frank Noe, 40, a Stoughton, Mass., fireman; Nate Genna, 41, of
Boston, who works in the operations and maintenance department of a
shopping mall; William Johnson, 41, of Manchester, Conn., an
electric-sign maker; and Mike Wallace, a 41-year-old farmer from
Langdon, Kan.
   Joining them is Robert Dalton, a 54-year-old free lance writer
from Davidsonville, Md., who served three tours of duty in Vietnam
and speaks fluent Vietnamese.
   They are scheduled to arrive in Hanoi Jan. 14 on a 10-day tour of
Vietnam, reunified by the Communist-led Hanoi government of the
North that toppled the U.S.-backed Saigon government of the South.
   From the country's seat of government in Hanoi, they travel
southward as friends instead of foes to familiar war zones like Dong
Ha, and Hue, capital of the Annam empire, established more than 200
years before Christ.
   Even though the Vietnamese insist that they have cleared the
mines and that the six Americans are visiting the country as
tourists, their return symbolizes the further healing of wounds from
America's longest and most divisive war.
   Vietnam has been opening its once closed doors wider and wider,
seeking to publicize its desire to establish diplomatic relations
with the United States in a bid for economic aid and medical and
technical assistance. Washington says that won't happen until
Vietnam removes all its troops from Cambodia, which Hanoi has
promised by 1990.
   The latest mission is a private one paid for by a benefactor whom
Spanos will identify only as a wealthy businessman. Spanos says his
group will submit its findings to both governments.
   ``They are welcome,'' says Ambassador Trinh Xuan Lang, head of
the Vietnamese mission to the United Nations. ``They return without
any animosity.''
   In the past year, more than 60 American delegations have visited
Vietnam, including veterans, congressmen, senators, scholars,
journalists and tourists, according to Lang. ``These visits will
contribute to better understanding,'' he says.
   The ex-Marines reconstructed mine field maps and gave them to the
Vietnamese government last June. While in Vietnam, they want to go
to the areas with their Vietnamese counterparts to take a firsthand
look not only for land mines but also any unexploded bombs and
shells dropped by U.S. forces.
   The once gung-ho Marines, mellowed by time, hope to visit a
Vietnamese veterans hospital filled with soldiers like themselves
and an orphanage crowded with malnourished children. They'll carry
medicine, badly needed by a medical system ravaged by five decades
of war.
   ``I was bitter at that time,'' Genna says of his combat days at
Dong Ha from January 1967 until January 1968. ``That whole war was
wrong. Americans got killed and plenty of Vietnamese got killed. I'm
not the 19-year-old kid I was then. This is a show of good will,
people to people. We're trying to establish one more step toward
normalizing relations and increasing understanding between the two
countries.''
   Noe, who served 18 months in Vietnam, says the trip will help
erase an already fading and unjustified image of Vietnam veterans as
brutal killers who often aimed their shots at women and children.
Many came home to rejection, spat upon and called ``baby killers.''
Some turned to drugs and alcohol.
   ``Men who once fought against each other can heal old wounds and
sit down and maybe even talk about those days,'' says Noe. ``I think
it will do us some good and them also. I think in this country it's
going to show Vietnam veterans aren't what they've been portrayed
over the years, that we're firemen, police, from every walk of life,
and do care about people.''
   Hundreds of people, some of them veterans, have telephoned and
written words of encouragement and praise.
   Jacob Bell, the 15-year-old son of another ex-Marine, wrote a
poem for those going back. It reads in part:
   ``So now a few, who represent us all,
   ``Have heard the victims innocent call,
   `` ... Go for us, reach out a hand,
   ``Let our country see how united we stand.''
   Wallace, who served as a medic with the 11th Marines, says:
``We're finding out it's a reconciliation, a healing process, not
only for veterans but for their families. If you can redo some
tragic part of life and replace it with good memories, it's got to
be therapeutic.''
   The former Marines say they never planted the mines with the
intention of hurting civilians but rather to protect American lives.
Barbed wire was placed around the mine fields with warning signs in
Vietnamese and English. But after the war's end in 1975, poor
Vietnamese farmers and scavengers apparently dismantled the valuable
barbed wire, exposing the mine fields.
   Ambassador Lang says all of the mines have been removed at the
cost of thousands of civilians killed, particularly during the three
years following the end of the war when land was being cleared for
farming and housing.
   Spanos says other veterans who visited Vietnam in recent years
reported seeing children in hospitals who had been wounded by mines
and unexploded shells.
   Spanos got the idea for the goodwill mission at the 11th Marines'
first reunion in Chicago in September 1987 after reading an article
in the Boston Globe. H.D.S. Greenway reported that he was told more
than 3,000 Vietnamese had died in one province alone from mines and
unexploded shells between 1975 and '85.
   Spanos' reaction was, ``God Almighty, if we're still killing
these innocent people, we've got to do something. Let's go back.''

   While the former engineers are not so sure, Dalton, who has made
three previous trips to Vietnam in the past two years, says he is
convinced the mines have been removed in the northern areas although
he cannot be as certain about other sections of the country.
   ``I think it will be a very good thing not only for the Marines
to go back to close the door on past operations in their mind but
also to allow the Vietnamese who suffered in clearing these mine
fields to see the Americans return fully prepared to help them,''
says Dalton.
   A 1987 report compiled by the U.S. State Department based on
estimates provided by Vietnamese government and other sources said
there were more than 300,000 people in the country who were disabled
from the war, including 15,000 amputees between 7 and 15 years old.
   Further illustrating the desperate plight of the Vietnamese,
officials estimate that half of the country's children are
malnourished.
   The U.S. government is forbidden by law to provide assistance to
Vietnam but has tried to make it easier for individuals and
organizations to send humanitarian aid.
   More former Vietnam veterans are planning to return this year if
they can raise the funds, including a group from the Veterans Viet
Nam Restoration Project in Garberville, Calif., whose goal is to
build and equip medical clinics across the country.
   A one-man operation, Bill Fero, a 38-year-old autoworker and
farmer from Whitewater, Wis., is scheduled to make his fourth trip
back in two years, carrying medical supplies.
   Fero had been filled with hate for the Vietnamese after a booby
trap blew off both of his legs. He suffered through 11 operations
and twice tried suicide.
   His return to Vietnam, he says, changed his life. ``The soldiers
in Vietnam are the same as soldiers in America. They had no choice.
I was met by 200 disabled Communist soldiers like me at a home in
Hanoi, most of them paralyzed. They treated me with so much love, I
couldn't hate them.''

   Japan's economy roared ahead in 1988 with few signs
of a slowdown, but economists say regulations stifling domestic
growth must be slashed to maintain momentum for further expansion.
   Strong consumer and corporate spending, low inflation and
unemployment and double-digit increases in productivity have kept
the pace of economic growth at an estimated 4.5 percent this year _
well ahead of the rest of the industrialized world.
   In fiscal 1987, a 4.9 percent growth rate pulled the economy out
of a slump that had raised Japan's jobless rate to a postwar high of
3.2 percent early in the year. Unemployment now hovers at about 2.6
percent.
   Since 1986, when the powerful yen battered Japanese exports,
corporate streamlining, cheaper import prices and lower lending
rates have enabled Japan to boost domestic demand, shifting its
engine of growth away from exports.
   The yen has nearly doubled in value against the dollar since late
1985, when monetary authorities allowed the dollar's value to fall
to improve the competitiveness of American exports and trim
Washington's massive trade deficit.
   Japan's stock markets also are booming, despite the crash of
October 1987. The Tokyo market's key indicator, the Nikkei Stock
Average of 225 issues, ended the year at a record 30,159.00.
   This year an inflow of funds from overseas and from the
abolishment of tax-free savings accounts gradually is making
available 430 trillion yen, or about $3.55 trillion, of extra cash,
boosting investment and consumer spending.
   The ballooning value of assets, including land and stocks, and
lower prices have made the once-frugal Japanese more aggressive
spenders.
   Personal spending, up an estimated 4.5 percent this year,
accounts for more than half of Japan's gross national product, or
the total output of its goods and services.
   Exports also continue to feed the economy. After falling for 15
months from year-earlier levels, Japan's trade surplus reversed
direction in July and began to rise.
   The latest GNP figures show the economy grew at a 9.3 percent
annual rate from July to September, following a 3.9 percent
contraction in the previous quarter.
   The expansion stemmed mainly from strong domestic demand and from
exports, which are growing 20 percent a year, outpacing imports,
which grew at a 13 percent annual rate. Finance Ministry officials
predict the trend will continue.
   Reports by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry show
that Japan will not meet its target this year for cutting its trade
surplus by $11 billion from $79.83 billion in 1987, despite
projections that imports from the United States will grow 90.7
percent and those from Europe 107.4 percent.
   There is little danger of the economy overheating, however,
because Japan is almost inflation-proof, says Richard C. Koo, senior
economist at Nomura Research Institute. Prices rose a scant 0.1
percent in 1987 and have stayed almost flat this year.
   The yen's strength and lower oil prices should help keep prices
relatively stable into the forseeable future, Bank of Japan Governor
Satoshi Sumita says. But he has expressed concern a labor shortage
could cause problems later.
   The ratio of job offers to applicants hit 1.05 in June,
reflecting intensifying employer competition for a shrinking pool of
skilled workers, labor economist Eiko Shinotsuka says.
   ``The low jobless rate is frustrating expansion-minded
executives,'' Ms. Shinotsuka wrote in a recent article. ``Many
manufacturing companies would like to augment output to meet surplus
demand but cannot recruit enough skilled workers.''
   Labor shortages are pinching construction and service companies,
but overtime and high productivity _ rising about 10 percent per
year _ are helping to insulate manufacturers from wage-related
inflation, says Susumu Kato, chief economist at the Tokyo offices of
the British banking concern County NatWest.
   There is also the rest of the world to cause potential problems.
   Global economic integration has made Japan more vulnerable to
shocks from overseas, says Johsen Takahashi, director of Mitsubishi
Research Institute.
   Japan accounted for 39 percent, or $9.5 trillion, of the combined
capital of the London, New York, Tokyo and Frankfurt financial
markets in 1987.
   That figure is likely to have grown in 1988 as funds flowed into
Tokyo's stock exchange, attracted by its phenomenal post-crash
performance.
   While economic fundamentals point to a continuation of Tokyo's
bull market, another shock like Black Monday in New York would pull
Tokyo's market down, Takahashi says.
   ``One lesson of last year is that all markets move together,''
says Koo.
   Some economists warn that Japan needs a new source of economic
energy.
   Housing starts, which led the economic recovery in 1987, have
declined since their peak in July, and increased reliance on export
growth would worsen trade friction.
   Kato predicts higher wages will fuel a 6.5 percent increase in
consumer spending next year, but says the economy needs a further
boost from deregulation to achieve continued 5 percent growth.
   A government advisory council said in a recent report that
overregulation has stifled Japan's retail sector, agriculture,
transportation, telecommunications, finance and energy.
   ``Government regulations should be limited to regulations needed
to deal with emergencies or other abnormal situations,'' the report
said.
   At question is whether the political will exists to enact changes
that have been resisted for decades by the special interests
protected by those regulations.
   On Dec. 13, the government approved a program aimed at easing a
wide range of controls to help vitalize the private sector and open
Japan's markets to imports.
   The program would promote rationalization of Japan's convoluted
distribution system and free competition throughout the economy.
   ``If the government meets its challenge by deregulating the
economy further there will be plenty of demand to keep the economy
growing,'' says Koo.

<HEAD>Japanese Firms Working To Improve Minority Hiring In U.S.</HEAD>

   Japanese firms are waking up to the need to recruit
minority employees in the United States, but only after prodding by
U.S. officials and civil rights groups.
   Japanese companies came under fire for not hiring enough
minorities, particularly blacks, in the United States following a
string of remarks by politicians and sales campaigns in Japan that
smacked of racism.
   Racial awareness in Japan takes on added significance as growing
Japanese investment in America _ $14.7 billion in fiscal 1987
according to Japanese statistics _ puts more American workers in
Japanese-owned businesses.
   ``They don't realize they are obliged, under the Federal Contract
Compliance Program, to achieve certain goals and quotas if they do
business with the U.S. government,'' says Colleen O'Connor of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   The hiring regulations apply to Japanese firms ``whether they
sell engines to the Pentagon or cameras to the Forest Service,'' Ms.
O'Connor says.
   Remarks by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and ex-Finance
Minister Michio Watanabe in the past two years suggested that blacks
were intellectually inferior and defaulted on their debts.
   Japanese toys resembling black Sambo figures, with huge eyes and
distorted red lips, and advertising campaigns using similarly
exaggerated mannequins last summer further angered American blacks.
   Sanrio, creator of the Sambo-like figures, recalled the products
at a loss of $11.5 million and also apologized, announcing it would
donate $257,000 in toys to poor children in San Francisco.
   But black dolls continue to sell in Japan, including a black
Sambo Santa Claus this past Christmas season, and are used in
numerous advertisments.
   Mervyn Dymally, a black U.S. congressman from California, has
complained that Japan was not making progress on racial awareness.
``In typical Asian fashion, they have been very polite, but nothing
has happened,'' he said.
   More than two dozen black organizations called for a buy-American
campaign during Christmas to impress upon Japan the power of
American blacks' $300 billion in annual consumer spending.
   Japanese companies argue that they are complying with U.S.
regulations. But like some U.S. firms, it may take legal action to
force them into action.
   In March the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission ordered
Honda of America Manufacturing to pay $6 million to 377 blacks and
women for not hiring them sooner.
   ``It's primarily a cultural difference,'' said John Eastman of
the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in a telephone interview. ``In
Honda's case, once they realized the law, they established positive
recruitment. They were willing to sit down and negotiate, and put in
place an equal opportunity program.''
   But Robert Cole of the University of Michigan's business school
and visiting professor at Tokyo's Keio University says Japanese
firms tend to locate in areas away from high minority concentration.
   Cole studied 100 sites of auto manufacturers and suppliers in the
United States. ``What I found was that Japanese auto-related firms
located in areas with relatively few blacks,'' he said in an
interview in Tokyo.
   Honda is in a region with a black labor pool of 10.5 percent, but
is only 2.8 percent black at its facilities in Marysville, Ohio,
according to Cole's study. Nissan, in Smyrna, Tenn., would be
expected to have 19.3 percent minorities but has 14 percent, and
Mazda in Flat Rock, Mich., has 14.1 percent black employment vs. 29
percent available.
   The minority employment ratio at the three major U.S. automakers
is much higher than the 11 percent that blacks represent in the U.S.
labor force, Cole says.
   Japanese manufacturers ``have located in rural areas which are
not heavily populated by minorities,'' agrees the Civil Rights
Commission's Eastman. ``They're not locating in suburban Chicago,
Detroit or Cleveland.''
   Honda spokesman Roger Lambert disagrees with Cole's calculations,
claiming the black labor pool within reasonable commuting distance
of Honda is only 3.5 percent. Honda also recruits blacks from Ohio
high schools, Lambert says.
   Like Toyota and electronics giant Sony, Honda contributes to the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, United
Negro College Fund and Urban League. These companies also have
increased advertising in minority publications like Ebony and Black
Enterprise magazines and in other black community media.
   Sony and Toyota retain agencies specializing in marketing to
minority consumers.
   Yet Cole says interviews with auto and investment consultants
found that Japanese companies systematically sought areas with low
concentrations of blacks and other minorities.
   Japanese firms do this for ``risk minimization,'' Cole says.
``Blacks are an unknown quantity.''
   Japanese manufacturers, particularly automakers with large
production facilities, bristle at suggestions of racism.
   ``We have an absolute policy of equal opportunity for minorities
and women,'' said a Toyota spokesman in Tokyo, noting that Toyota's
minority employment in Kentucky, where the automaker operates a
plant in Georgetown, is 13 percent, the highest in the state. It
also began its TEAM (Toyota Equal Access for Minorities) program in
March to expand minority hiring.
   Nissan harbors ``no discrimination based on race, sex or
ideology,'' says a company spokesman. ``The states set a minimum for
minority hiring, and we've cleared them for certain.''
   He acknowledged, however, that Tennessee, where Nissan has its
factory, has no such regulations. Nissan does not release statistics
on its minority hiring.
   Sony, which employs 7,000 people in the United States, also
contributes to minority programs at New York colleges, says Sony
spokesman Tom Sugiyama.
   ``We offer trainee positions to minorities, and if they qualify
will be permanently hired,'' Sugiyama says. ``We are obliged to meet
affirmative action plans. We are above the average.''
   Sony also assists young black artists in film, television and
music.
   Toshiba's policy on racial hiring is to ``leave it to our people
there,'' a spokesman said. ``We basically support equal opportunity
based on local laws and regulations concerning sex, age or color.
It's all within the law.'' The spokesman, who would not be named,
declined to provide further information.
   Minority groups are also pressing for increased management roles,
including auto dealerships, from the Japanese.
   According to the National Association of Minority Automobile
Dealers, Nissan has only one minority dealership (0.1 percent of its
total), and Toyota has three (0.3 percent), while blacks own just
eight of nearly 5,000 Japanese car dealerships in America.
   Ford has 170 minority dealerships (3.4 percent) and GM 204 (2
percent), the association says.
   Improvements come slowly. ``There's a learning curve, and the
Japanese are quick students,'' says Cole. ``But it doesn't seem to
me that they're taking any leadership role, and I find that
disturbing.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years ago the cash income of American
farmers was improving from the Depression low marks and the outlook
for 1939 appeared reasonably bright to Agriculture Department
experts.
   The world would change forever before 1939 ended, as Germany's
invasion of Poland spread into World War II. At the moment, however,
farmers had more money to spend, and USDA economists were watching
where it went.
   Higher cash income from farm marketings in 1939 was anticipated
by the USDA experts, who also noted that ``government payments
probably will exceed 1938 payments'' and that income from non-farm
sources could a rise a bit, too.
   ``As incomes rise, farm families tend to spend part of the
increase for living, but they apply a larger share than do city
families toward getting ahead financially _ paying off debts and
making improvements on the farm,'' said a USDA outlook report of
December 1938.
   The report added: ``Dollar for dollar, the farm family's money
income is expected to stretch about as far next year as this, since
the general level of prices of commodities bought for living is
expected to change little in 1939 from late 1938.''
   Some of the 50-year-old USDA analysis appears familiar.
Economists are saying much the same today about the role of federal
payments, inflation and debts.
   But the old report mentions something else: the change by 1939 in
the lifestyle and expectations of American farm families.
   ``During the 1930s there has been a trend toward broadened social
contacts for farm families through improved transportation and
communication,'' the report said. ``Better roads, more widespread
ownership and greater use of automobilies, and an increased number
of radios have contributed to this development.''
   Television was still a science fiction dream for most Americans
in 1939, and it was radio that brought news and entertainment to
remote areas of the country, with battery sets and the gradual
spread of electric power lines.
   ``About three-fifths of all farm families now have radios, and
there is likelihood of a further increase in 1939,'' the report said.
   Further, there was evidence that a larger proportion of farm
families owned automobiles than their city cousins. One study in
1935-36 found that up to 85 percent of the ``native-white,
non-relief families'' of farm operators owned automobiles, the
report said, obviously excluding millions of black and white
families in the mid-1930s who were too poor to own automobiles.
   ``Trends toward more comfortable living are evidenced by
electrification and other improvements of farm homes and by
purchases of household equipment that lightens labor,'' the report
said. ``Electricity now is used on 18 percent of all farms as
compared with 13 percent in 1930.''
   It added: ``These trends bid fair to continue in 1939, in part
because of the government program of encouraging rural
electrification, and in part because of anticipated income
increases.''
   Already the improved farm economy _ cash income was estimated at
$7.63 billion in 1938, compared with $4.33 billion in 1932 _ had
brought fundamental and everlasting changes in how money was spent.
   ``In two-thirds of the farm areas included in a 1935-36 study of
family living, expenditures for the purchase and operation of the
family car took about one-sixth of the aggregate expenditures for
all living of non-relief, native-born, white families of farm
operators,'' the report said.
   ``A 1922-24 study showed less than one-tenth of expenditures
allocated to the family's use of the automobile,'' it added.
   Five months later, in May 1939, the USDA's monthly outlook report
was uncertain about the way things were going. Wheat prices were
still depressed but edged to an average of 57.8 cents per bushel,
the highest in a year. Hogs, at $6.57 per 100 pounds, were down more
than a dollar.
   ``Unfavorable European political developments and the
accompanying sharp declines in security prices during March and
early April were followed by an extensive coal strike,'' the May
1939 report said.
   ``Recent developments have helped to postpone and might even
prevent altogether, the moderate improvement in business and demand
conditions which has been anticipated,'' it added. ``But with
building construction continuing very active, government spending at
a high level and most lines of industry doing about as well as could
be expected, there is no reason to expect any serious recession even
if some of the present uncertainties continue for a time.''

<HEAD>BMW 535i a Costly Dream</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It's smooth. It's quiet. The 1989 BMW 535i seems to glide across
the road.
   It's hard not to daydream when driving becomes as effortless and
comfortable as it is in this new model from BMW. But the 535i's
price tag _ a hefty $43,600 base price _ may jolt you out of the
reverie.
   Newly designed for the 1989 model year, the 535i borrows many
fine traits from its bigger kin, the 7-series that was introduced in
1987. There is a distinctive BMW outward appearance, an inner
luxuriousness and quiet ride.
   The 535i goes further, however, in its sporty appeal. Suspension
is superb, taut. This car holds the road in all kinds of maneuvers,
at all speeds. Antilock brakes are exceptional, especially at high
speeds. The engine, an improved version of BMW's 3.5 liter, is
impressive.
   The test car was a five-speed manual, and shifting was smooth and
flawless. Response from the in-line, six-cylinder engine was
immediate. At each standing start, there was a strong push from the
rear wheels (the car is rear-drive).
   The powerplant is capable of developing 208 horsepower, up from
182 in the old engine. Yet even with the boost in power, the BMW is
oh-so-quiet, thanks to improved sound-deadening materials and a
sleek line along the compact, aerodynamic, outer body that reduces
wind noise.
   The interior of the test version was easily one of the most
comfortable of any car, with leather seats that were electrically
adjustable and dashboard instruments that were well-organized and
well-placed.
   The steering wheel, however, was not adjustable because of the
airbag stowed in it. The fuel tank had room for 21 gallons, a
convenience on long trips. With so much fuel, it took a while for
the fuel gauge needle to budge from the full mark.
   There were unique touches. For example, the windshield wipers
adjusted their speed to the speed of the car, and the wipers
automatically pressed harder against the windshield on the driver's
side as speed increased. And the driver's door lock was heated just
by lifting the door handle for a moment.
   There also was an on-board computer that chimed and lighted up
below the speedometer to warn the driver when the car exceeded the
speed limit programmed in by the driver.
   I had a dickens of a time getting used to that, perhaps because
in a car this quiet, this smooth, it was so easy to speed.
   For 1989, BMW also added 5.4 inches to the 535i's wheelbase and
made the car 1 inch wider. It trimmed the length by 3.2 inches but
added 260 pounds to the car. Height is about the same.
   Competitors include the Mercedes 300E and Jaguar XJ6, BMW
spokesman Rob Mitchell said.
   ``We're all in the same price category and all are fairly
luxurious cars,'' he said. ``But in ours we are more
driver-oriented, more sporting. We put more emphasis on the driver.''
   Sales _ and rave reviews from the auto press _ have been
encouraging. The 535i and its lower-priced ($37,000 base) sister,
the 525i, started to trickle in last October. Sales through November
totaled 2,529 for the two models combined, Mitchell said.
   That accounts for about 23 percent of total BMW sales, which is
the percentage share that BMW planned for the 5-series, he said. For
calendar 1989, the automaker looks for 21,000 sales of 5-series
cars, up from 14,000 in 1988 when the old 5-series cars were being
phased out of production. But, as the price indicates, not everyone
can afford one.
   Mitchell said previous 535i owners (when the base price was
around $37,000) have been predominantly male (81 percent) with
average household income of $130,000 a year. The average age is 41,
and 35 percent are business executives, 20 percent professionals, 10
percent middle management and 10 percent self-employed.
   Because the 535i is newly designed for 1989, Consumer Reports
does not list owner trouble reports for this model. In the past,
however, costs for repairs have been much higher than those for
average cars.

   In two of the largest savings and loan bailouts
yet, federal regulators announced agreements to provide $6.8 billion
in government aid to rescue the nation's largest insolvent S&L and
to assist in the takeover of five problem thrift institutions in
Texas.
   The rescue packages, detailed Wednesday, involved American
Savings and Loan Association of Stockton, Calif., the nation's
second-largest S&L and the biggest one that is classified as
insolvent, and a group of five of the most troubled S&Ls in Texas.
   The Texas thrifts will be bought by a group led by Ronald O.
Perelman, the takeover specialist who heads the Revlon cosmetics
firm. American Savings is being sold to a group headed by Texas

   Energy futures prices were generally lower in
light trading with little news to direct the market.
   However, after the close of trading Wednesday, the American
Petroleum Institute reported that stocks of U.S. crude and heating
oil and gasoline declined in the week ended Dec. 23, news that
generally boosts the market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose
2 cents to settle at $16.97 a barrel. All subsequent contract months
declined.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
January contract for wholesale home heating oil slipped 0.28 cent to
53.49 cents a gallon.
   January wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 0.43 cent lower to
close at 47.04 cents a gallon.
   Richard Redoglia, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
said there was little news to influence trading, and that prices
were brought down by profit-taking.
   ``The market is in yearend liquidation,'' he said.
   No trend could be established from Wednesday's session, he said.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior energy analyst with E.D.&F. Man
International Futures Inc., said the February WTI contract rose
because of the closure of three oil fields in the British section of
the North Sea. The shutdown raised supply concerns, he said.
   The fields produce about 210,000 barrels a day, or about 10
percent of Britain's total production.

   A massive stock-profiteering scandal, Emperor
Hirohito's illness and other obstacles failed to slow the world's
richest stock market as it ended 1988 at a record high, up 42
percent for the year.
   Analysts looked for gains to continue into next year on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, where the start of the six-day New Year holidays
began with a ritual hand-clapping by 2,000 traders.
   In what one dealer described as a ``festival market'' Wednesday,
the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average climbed 108.07 points, or 0.36
percent, and ended the year at a record 30,159.00.
   The Nikkei had opened 1988 at 21,217.04. By April, it was at the
27,000-point level, above its highs before the October 1987 crash.
The foundering New York and London markets have yet to regain
pre-crash levels.
   Analysts said the market climbed despite a number of obstacles,
including a massive stock-profiteering scandal, Emperor Hirohito's
illness, currency fluctuations and unstable oil prices.
   ``There were some negative factors from time to time, but the
overall market situation was healthy and bullish throughout the
year,'' said Mike Morizumi at Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Tokyo office.
   ``All bad news has been discounted already and the market is as
strong as it looks,'' he said. ``It turned out to be much better
than most of us expected at the beginning of the year.''
   Josen Takahashi, a chief economist at Mitsubishi Research
Institute, a major think-tank, said Tokyo was able to recover faster
than other markets from the 1987 crash because of Japan's brisk
economic growth and a calm business environment.
   ``Japan was in the middle of a historical domestic demand
expansion in the fourth quarter of 1987 and the first quarter of
1988,'' Takahashi said. ``The market crash luckily coincided with
that period.''
   Analysts said, however, that the rise of Tokyo stock prices was
hindered by a major scandal in which dozens of prominent politicians
and business leaders were offered unlisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos,
a real estate company, at bargain rates. They profited after the
stock was publicly offered and rose in price.
   The transactions were legal, but opposition parties and the
general public questioned the ethics of influential figures taking
advantage of privileged access to unlisted shares.
   ``The scandal knocked a lot of confidence from the market and it
prevented the Nikkei from moving high,'' said Morizumi. ``And there
are still some after-effects.''
   Starting in April, investors' gains from stock transactions won't
be as big. A tax reform package enacted this week imposes a 20
percent capital gains tax. But the tax is not expected to adversely
affect the market.
   The illness of the 87-year-old emperor has been seen as a damper
on active investing. Hirohito fell seriously ill on Sept. 19 and has
been bedridden.
   Many investors do not want to be sitting with large stock
holdings when the emperor dies, analysts said.
   ``The market will go down a little bit when he does die,'' said
Morizumi. ``But that's just a sympathetic gesture and it will
recover thereafter.''
   Thomas Zengage of International Business Information, a
consulting firm based in Tokyo, said most major problems in the
market already have been reflected in current share prices and
bullishness likely will carry into the first half of 1989.
   ``Unless there is a dramatic change in the market environment
such as the sudden crash of land prices or a drastic fluctuation of
exchange rates, the Tokyo stock market will continue to be strong
for a while,'' he said.
   With total value of shares exceeding 400 trillion yen, or aout
$3.23 trillion, the Tokyo Stock Exchange is the world's richest. The
Japanese market accounts for about 45 percent of the total value of
the world's stock markets, compared with about 30 percent for the
United States.

   U.S. manufacturers of small business telephone
equipment will continue to suffer financially with their very
survival in jeopardy if Japan, Korea and Taiwan are allowed to
continue selling their products at unfairly low prices, American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. charges.
   AT&T on Wednesday filed a petition asking the Commerce Department
to investigate charges that more than a dozen foreign manufacturers
are setting cut-rate prices for their equipment marketed in the
United States, while charging more for the same equipment in their
home markets.
   If this pricing practice continues, ``the future survival of the
domestic industry is truly in doubt,'' AT&T said in its petition.
   ``Domestic producers have already been substantially weakened
financially, and their ability to continue to make the capital and
research investments necessary to remain competitive in this market
has been severely compromised,'' AT&T said.
   AT&T said its Government Business Systems, the largest U.S.
manufacturer of these products, has already been forced to make
unspecified cuts and further reductions in the future may be
necessary.
   ``Ultimately, the domestic small-business telephone systems
industry, and the technological base it embodies, may disappear
altogether,'' AT&T said.
   In its petition, AT&T detailed the extent of the damage the
foreign manufacturers' alleged underselling has caused to its own
operations, but many of those details were deleted from copies of
the complaint made public.
   Under U.S. law, it is illegal for foreign companies to sell
products in the U.S. market for less than they sell them at home.
When AT&T announced last week that it would file the petition, it
said the foreign companies' prices in their home markets were an
average 75 percent higher than their prices in the U.S. market, and
in one case 170 percent higher.
   The petition involves equipment for small businesses with two to
80 phone lines. The two major types are known as key systems and
private branch exchanges, or PBXs.
   The Commerce Department has 20 days in which to decide whether to
investigate AT&T's charges. If it initiates an investigation, the
International Trade Commission will begin a separate probe to
determine whether the alleged ``dumping'' has harmed the U.S.
industry and will make a preliminary finding within 45 days.
   Final determinations by both the department and the commission
and possible imposition of anti-dumping duties would occur in about
a year.
   The Japanese companies named in the petition are: Hasegawa,
Iwatsu, Matsushita, Maisei, Nakayo, Nitsuko, Tamura and Toshiba.
   Also named were South Korea's Goldstar, OPC and Samsung and
Taiwan's Sun Moon Star.

   A swap of a three-year wage freeze for a $90
million plant modernization program will help secure jobs at H.J.
Heinz Co.'s Pittsburgh plant, union leaders say.
   ``The single most important gain we achieved in this contract is
a new factory,'' said Michael Kedzuf, president of United Food and
Commercial Workers Local 325.
   Without such a program, workers could have expected an ``extreme
and rapid reduction in the work force'' as Heinz shifted products to
factories with lower production costs, Kedzuf said Wednesday.
   The 1,000 members are to vote on the five-year contract by mail.
Ballots will be counted Jan. 6.
   Once the plant is modernized, blue-collar employment is expected
to drop from the current 1,000 to about 750 through normal attrition
and a sweetened early retirement package but not through layoffs,
Kedzuf said.
   For the first three years, workers would not receive a raise. In
the last two years, workers would get a 35-cent-per-hour raise and
cost-of-living increases.
   The average union salary is $10.97 per hour. Over five years, the
contract should increase average hourly pay by about $1.47, the
union said.

USX said Wednesday.
   Chemical Bank led a consortium that financed the deal.
   Transtar assumed existing labor contracts, recognized employee
representatives and will provide comparable benefits. No changes are

   The deal covers the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Co.;
Birmingham Southern Railroad Co.; Duluty, Missabe and Iron Range
Railway Co.; Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway Co.; The Lake
Terminal Railroad Co.; Union Railroad Co.; McKeesport Connecting
Railroad; Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co.; Pittsburgh & Conneaut Dock

   The companies employ about 4,000 workers operating about 300
locomotives and 2,000 rail cars over more than 2,000 miles of track.
They also operate 12 lake vessels, 305 barges and 27 tugboats.
   Donald H. Hoffman, formerly president of the USX railroads, is
president and chief executive of Transtar.
   Leading figures in the Blackstone group include former U.S.
Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson, former Treasury Secretary
Roger C. Altman and former director of the Office of Management and

<HEAD>No Deal, Cox Says of New Proposal on Sale Of The Miami News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cox Newspapers has rejected a new offer from a group
of investors who want to buy the city's oldest daily, The Miami
News, which is scheduled to shut down Saturday.
   David Easterly, president of the Atlanta-based Cox Newspapers
division, said Wednesday the offer called for Cox to fund the
paper's losses for six weeks while the buyers secured a loan.
   ``We absolutely rejected that concept,'' Easterly said.
   John R. Malone, a Chicago newspaper consultant, represents the
group of investors that wants to buy the 92-year-old newspaper.
   Cox previously said it would keep The News open through early
February, provided Malone came up with certain escrow deposits.
   ``Since Dec. 23, we've been waiting to hear from him and have him
put in escrow enough money to support the losses of the News through
the period he asked us to continue publication,'' Easterly said.
   ``If Mr. Malone is prepared to honor the Dec. 23 proposal, he can
buy the Miami News,'' Easterly said. ``Otherwise we will close the
paper after Saturday's edition.''
   Cox officials estimate The News' operating costs during 1988 at
about $9 million, or $750,000 a month.
   The News is still making contingency plans in case the paper
continues publishing after Saturday, said Publisher David Kraslow.
   ``We're going ahead with the way we were,'' Kraslow said. But he
added, ``My expecation is that the paper will close.''

   Orthopedic surgeons, a burly sort among physicians,
face occupational hazards ranging from misplaced pins and falling
traction weights to accidental scalpel stabbings, according to a
survey.
   Writing in this week's British Medical Journal, three doctors
report that ``orthopedic surgery can be extremely hazardous and
nobody in the (operating) theater is safe.''
   The Christmas issue of the prestigious journal is filled with
oddities such as the effect of haggis, the Scottish national dish,
on cholesterol levels, a woman whose vast intake of tomato soup
discolored her skin, disorders caused by eating mangoes, and the
connection between opium-smoking and cauliflower ear among elderly
Chinese patients.
   There's no telling whether the orthopedic researchers see a real
crisis, or are just saying, tongue-in-cheek, that, `Hey,
bone-doctors have feelings too.' The research method does, however,
appear rigorous enough to cause some consternation in orthopedic
circles.
   Drs. Ivan Brenkel of the Leeds Hospital orthopedic department,
Joseph Dias of Glenfield Hospital, Leicester and S.G. Tordoff of
Poole General Hospital said they mailed questionnaires to some 1,000
British orthopedic surgeons, including retired consultants, and
received 355 replies.
   Their conclusion: ``The combination of brute force and sharp
instruments needed lays the orthopedic surgeon open to painful and
occasionally serious injury.''
   Among the ``remarkable'' number of mishaps reported, the most
bizarre involves a mouse:
   ``A certain surgeon was about to operate on a patient under a
spinal anesthetic when suddenly a mouse ran across the floor of the
theater, causing consternation and terror among the nursing staff.
Its whereabouts were unknown until suddenly the patient sat up and,
pointing at the mouse, shouted triumphantly: `There it is!'
   ``Order having been restored by catching the mouse, the surgeon
advanced once more toward the operating table. In doing so he struck
his head violently against the rim of the operating lamp, not
noticing that it had been placed somewhat lower than usual. He
collapsed on to the floor, briefly concussed...''
   While that sort of mishap could befall any surgeon, others
reported in the article were strictly orthopedic.
   ``Surgeons frequently skewer themselves or their assistants with
Denham pins,'' the doctors wrote. ``The most extreme example was
given by one consultant who, during the insertion of a Denham pin
into a patient's leg, managed to transfix his assistant's hand and
impale the patient's other leg... The unfortunate assistant had to
wait to be cut free.''
   Denham pins are inserted into bones to hold traction weights.
   One surgeon mentioned in the report handed a scalpel to a nurse
and accidentally stabbed a colleague in the midriff.
   ``There are numerous reports of buckets of plaster and traction
weights crushing a surgeon's foot,'' the doctors wrote. One slipped
on discarded surgical towels and ruptured his Achilles tendon, while
another slipped on stairs and sustained a fracture.
   Orthopedic surgeons are no safer at home, the doctors wrote,
citing one who injured a finger rescuing his dog from a fight, while
another who, vacationing in the Caribbean, had a finger tendon
severed by a bite from the barracuda he had just landed.
   To avoid injury, surgeons are advised to change their spectacles,
get their assistants to do the dangerous work, or ``become
anesthetists: there are no reports of injuries to doctors while
doing the Times crossword puzzle.''
   A separate article in the Journal, by Dr. David Barrett of the
Royal Berkshire Hospital, surveyed surgical glove sizes at 30
British hospitals and found that orthopedic surgeons take a size
7.6, against 7.4 for ordinary surgeons.
   From this he concluded that like their forerunners, who had to be
big and strong to overcome muscle spasm and hold broken bones
together, today's ``bone-setters'' tend to be just under an inch
taller than other surgeons.
   One explanation, he wrote, could be that ``orthopedics is still
perceived as a macho specialty... so that only the largest trainees
are encouraged to apply.''
   He added: ``This image is of course hurtful to orthopedic
surgeons, who under their larger exterior are deeply sensitive
people who are kind to animals and help old ladies to cross the
street.''

   Hordes of after-Christmas shoppers in
pursuit of bargains or returning gifts found themselves going down
an overcrowded up escalator.
   ``So many people rushed onto the escalator it stopped, and the
sheer weight made it reverse,'' Lazarus store manager Lance Lambert
said Monday.
   ``For a brief moment, people thought they were going nowhere
fast.''
   Shoppers headed for the store's second floor were cleared from
the escalator and a more orderly procession allowed the escalator's
gears to do their job.
   Lambert estimated the store would receive about 5,000 gift
returns.

   The 12-nation European Commission today
condemned the U.S. decision to impose sanctions on European food
exports in response to a ban on U.S. hormone-treated meat.
   ``The U.S. decisions are totally unjustifiable and contrary to
international standards,'' European Commissioner Willy De Clercq
said in a statement.
   The U.S. government announced Tuesday that beginning Jan. 1 it
will impose $100 million worth of trade sanctions against European
food products in retaliation for a scheduled Common Market ban on
imports of U.S. meat that contains growth hormones.
   The U.S. action in effect doubles the wholesale price for U.S.
consumers for such products as imported hams and canned Italian
tomatoes.
   European consumer groups have argued that using growth hormones,
fed to cattle to increase their bulk, poses a potential human health
threat.
   ``Any country and thus the community has the right to take
measures it judges necessary to protect the health of its
consumers,'' De Clercq said, ``as long as they are not
discriminatory.''
   The United States contends that the presence of the hormones in
meat is too small to be hazardous and that scientific evidence of
their threat to health is inconclusive.
   Four EEC countries _ West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and
Belgium _ have banned all hormones in cattle breeding for years. The
EEC has banned seven hormones.
   Trade between the United States and the European Community totals
$150 billion annually. But the sides have been locked in an
increasingly bitter trade dispute.
   Faced with the possibility of U.S. sanctions over its hormone
ban, the EEC tentatively agreed on Dec. 19 on a list of U.S.
products on which it would impose a 100 percent duty if Washington
goes ahead with its trade sanctions.
   This would include U.S. exports of honey, unshelled nuts, dried
fruit and canned corn.
   ``The European Commission is ready,'' De Clercq told the Belgian
radio. ``It has already proposed a list of measures which will have
to be adapted to the announced U.S. measures that are weaker than
previously announced. We have to take into account the attenuated
character of these measures.''
   EEC officials have lately added another reason for banning
hormones. They claim there is already too much meat on the EEC and
world markets, therefore they see no need for boosting production
with hormones.
   Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Argentina have agreed to
export hormone-free beef to Europe.

<HEAD>AT&T Acquiring Communication Equipment Maker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Communications giant American Telephone and Telegraph Co., broken
up by the government five years ago in a landmark antitrust case,
has started to expand aggressively by acquiring other companies.
   AT&T announced Tuesday that it would purchase Paradyne Corp., a
Largo, Fla., maker and repairer of data transmission devices, for
$250 million. The acquisition would give New York-based AT&T a
stronger position in the world market for data-communications
equipment.
   It is the largest acquisition by AT&T since its 1983 divestiture,
which revolutionized the telephone industry in the United States by
creating competing companies and spawning a $185 billion a year
business.
   The Paradyne announcement appeared to reflect AT&T's willingness
to grow by taking over other companies rather than internal
expansion. It came one week after AT&T agreed to acquire Eaton
Financial Services, an office equipment leasing concern based in
Framingham, Mass.
   Under the latest deal, AT&T will pay $10.25 in cash for all of
Paradyne's outstanding shares. The announcement almost doubled the
price of the target company's stock, which rose $4.75 a share to $10
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange and was the most heavily
traded issue of the day.
   Paradyne, which develops and manufactures data communications
equipment, ran into legal troubles a year ago in connection with its
attempt to land a big government computer contract.
   The company was fined $1.2 million in March 1987 after pleading
guilty to scheming to defraud the Social Security Administration to
obtain a $115 million computer contract in 1981, the largest ever
awarded by that agency.
   As part of a federal plea agreement, the government dropped six
other counts of bribery and making false statements, and Robert S.
Wiggins agreed to resigned as chairman, president and chief
executive officer.
   Paradyne hasn't had a profitable year since 1984. It lost $2.6
million last year; $38.5 million in 1986 and $31.2 million a year
earlier. In October, the company said it wrote off about $26 million
in losses for the third quarter.
   But AT&T spokesman Dick Gray said, ``Paradyne's new management
team has been turning things around. They've taken steps to improve
their operations and improve their chances of profitability.''
   ``Our folks have examined the company's operation and are
satisfied,'' he said. ``The problems they faced in the past are just
that _ in the past.''
   Since last year's settlement, Paradyne has withdrawn old and
unprofitable product lines from the market and said it would focus
on other goods that it could market effectively. In August, about
300 employees were laid off in a cost-saving measure.
   The companies plan to merge the existing data communications
equipment operations of Paradyne and AT&T, with the resulting
business entity becoming a subsidiary of AT&T. John Mitcham,
president and chief executive officer of Paradyne, will head that
unit.
   ``Merging these lines will enable this new AT&T subsidiary to
offer an even more comprehensive line of products and services to
meet our customers' global data networking needs,'' said Jack
Bucter, AT&T vice president for product management and marketing.
   Paradyne had 1987 worldwide sales of $233 million, with assets
totaling $263 million. The company distributes products in 47
countries and employs 2,600 people worldwide.
   AT&T had 1987 revenue of $33.6 billion.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunshine Mining Co. says it will pay $865.2 million
for plastics and petrochemical maker Rexene Corp., reflecting a
strategy to buy only businesses that do not depend on natural gas or
precious metal prices.
   ``We decided about nine months ago that, strategically, we needed
to put a third leg on the stool _ needed to get into a third line of
business,'' said G. Michael Boswell, Sunshine's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Sunshine officials said Tuesday that the company known primarily
for silver mining and natural gas production would pay $28 for each
of Rexene's 30.9 million shares of common stock in cash and
securities.
   Officials with the two Dallas-based firms said the deal is
subject to shareholder approval.
   Rexene, through its subsidiary Rexene Products Co., makes
thermoplastic resins and petrochemical products. Its products are
used in many household goods, including food packaging, toys,
plastic linings for disposable diapers, and styrene for production
of disposable cups and other containers.
   Sunshine lost more than $11 million during the quarter ending
Sept. 30, while Rexene made more than $35 million.
   Sunshine officials said the match is a natural for both
companies. Joe Denahan, executive vice president and chief financial
officer for Sunshine, said that when oil and gas prices are low, so
are the prices for the raw materials used by Rexene.
   Last week, Rexene announced that an unidentified public company
was interested in buying all outstanding shares. The company, which
went public in July, was among the biggest gainers on the New York
Stock Exchange last week, rising 50 percent.
   Trading in Rexene's stock was halted early Tuesday pending the
announcement and resumed later in the morning. It closed down $2.50,
at $22 a share on the NYSE, evidently reflecting investor
disappointment with the announcement.
   ``Part of Sunshine's strategy has been to acquire a third line of
business related to natural resources but (not) to oil and gas and
precious metals,'' Boswell said.
   ``Sunshine's acquisition of Rexene fits this criteria, as the
bulk of Rexene's raw materials are derivatives of natural gas
liquids,'' he said.
   Boswell said Sunshine plans no layoffs and will run the new
business using the current management.
   Rexene's primary production plants are both in Texas, in Odessa
and near Houston.
   ``We hope to reach a definitive agreement quickly and look
forward to working with Sunshine,'' said Rexene's chairman and chief
executive officer, Andrew J. Smith.
   ``One thing that made Rexene so attractive to us was that they
had a strong management team already in place that is willing to
stay,'' said Boswell. ``They have expressed no interest in leaving.''

<HEAD>Creditors Split into Two Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of LTV Corp. say disagreements among
members of the largest creditor group in a 2{-year-old bankruptcy
reorganization has led to a formal split into two new unsecured
creditors' committees.
   Dallas-based LTV said Tuesday that it supported the decision to
separate the committee of unsecured creditors into two groups. One
committee now represents LTV's Steel Co. creditors and the other
represents parent company creditors.
   The action follows ``frustration on all sides as to how to best
get this reorganization going and to stop the bickering between
creditors,'' said one major creditor of LTV Steel who asked not to
be identified.
   One fundamental difference between the creditors has been the
resolution of a longstanding conflict between LTV and the
government-run Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. over three underfunded
LTV Steel pension plans.
   A single committee has been an effective way to minimize the
financial and administrative burdens of the proceeding since the
Chapter 11 filing in July 1986 through its current stage, said James
F. Powers, LTV chief financial officer.
   ``However, the creditors believe the final stages leading to the
company's emergence from Chapter 11 can be most effectively
addressed with the new structure,'' said Powers. ``The company
agrees with this decision and will work with the two committees to
complete the plan of reorganization negotiation process as
expeditiously as possible.''
   The formal split into two committees was ``a positive
development'' in the reorganization, said Robin E. Phelan, an
attorney representing BancTexas Dallas, a trustee for some LTV
creditors.
   ``It will further enhance prospects for a successful
reorganization for the LTV Corp. and LTV Steel, because it will help
further the negotiating process and delineate issues between
creditors of LTV Steel and LTV Corp,'' said Phelan.

   Kellogg Co. said today it is recalling
the ``cool flute'' and binoculars toys packaged in some products
because small children could choke on them.
   Tests showed the plastic toys could break into small parts and
pose a hazard to children under 3 years old, Kellogg said.
   The company said about 30 million of the promotional toys have
been distributed since early 1988.
   The recall includes the ``cool flute'' _ a musical toy with two
tubes connected to a mouthpiece _ found in Corn POPS cereal, but not
``cool flute'' toys found in other products, the company said.
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission received a report of
a choking incident involving a ``cool flute'' which did not result
in serious injury, Kellogg said. The company said it has received no
complaints of injuries related to the toy.
   The binoculars _ two plastic lenses in a cardboard holder, were
distributed in marked boxes of Fruity Marshmallow Krispies, Cocoa
Krispies, Rice Krispies and 12-count Pop-Tarts toaster pastries. No
complaints of injuries involving the binoculars have been received,
Kellogg said.
   Customers were urged to take the toys away from children under 3
years old and either discard them or contact Kellogg's consumer
affairs department for reimbursement.

   Furniture-and-apparel maker Interco Inc. said
Wednesday that its board of directors has rejected a $190 million
cash offer for its Londontown Corp. subsidiary from Burlington Coat
Factory Warehouse Inc.
   Interco said in a statement that the proposal for the maker of
London Fog rainwear ``does not meet the board's requirements of an
assured, timely closing, and that uncertainties surrounding the
Burlington proposal and the risks of any delay could harm the
business of Londontown.''
   The St. Louis-based company recently announced plans to sell some
divisions as part of a restructuring plan that thwarted an
unsolicited takeover by the Rales Brothers, a pair of Washington
investors.
   The company has said it intends to retain its Converse Inc. and
Florsheim Shoe Co. subsidiaries, Broyhill Furniture Industries Inc.
and Lane Co. furniture companies.
   The sale of Londontown would leave Interco with 10 apparel
companies, five retail stores, four footwear companies and four
furniture companies.

   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee said today that despite a European ban on U.S. meat from
hormone-fed cattle some European farmers still use growth hormones
like those at the center of a dispute threatening a full-blown
U.S.-European trade war.
   The EC has said the meat constitutes a health threat to consumers.
   ``The fact is however that their own own farmers, not
withstanding their objections to growth hormones, grow their meat
with growth hormones,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   ``They realize as we do that those hormones are out of the meat
before they're slaughtered. So that's really not the issue,'' said
Leahy, D-Vt.
   Both sides are locked in an acrimonious dispute which threatens
to spill over into other areas of trade between America and its
European allies. Two-way trade between the United States and the
European Community totals $150 billion annually.
   On Tuesday, the Reagan administration vowed to impose $100
million worth of trade sanctions against European food products,
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1.
   The 100 percent duties will effectively double the wholesale
price at the U.S. border for such popular products as hams, canned
Italian tomatoes and imported wine coolers.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the stiff duties
will go into effect unless the Europeans back down on their ban on
imported meat products which contain growth hormones.
   The meat ban _ which is to be applied to all European suppliers,
not just the United States _ is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1.
Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Argentina already have agreed to
ship only hormone-free beef to Europe.
   Yeutter, who is President-elect Bush's choice for agriculture
secretary, said the European ban constituted an unfair trade
practice because there was no scientific evidence that the hormones,
which are used to increase bulk, cause any health effects in humans.
   The Common Market countries contend that while the scientific
evidence on meat hormones is not conclusive, they have the right to
take precautionary action to protect health.
   In a statement, the Reagan administration said the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration had determined that the daily production of
hormones in humans, even in children, is far higher than the
minuscule levels left in meat from treated animals.
   ``We have tried repeatedly to bring this issue to a scientific
dispute settlement panel under the (General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade) in order to have it resolved,'' Yeutter said in a statement.
``However, our European counterparts have blocked our efforts.''
   Yeutter said the $100 million in duties roughly equals the
estimated lost sales of American meat products in Europe.
   But Nico Wegter, the agriculture affairs spokesman for the EC
today disputed Yeutter's contention, saying the Europeans want the
GATT dialogue to include more than a discussion of scientific
arguments.
   ``We would have a discussion take into account all arguments
concerned, including the economic one, including the consumer
argument and that is what the Americans don't want to have,'' said
Wegter on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``We have gone now to GATT because we do not accept the
retaliation measures which have now been announced by the American
administration. We don't think that those measures are compatible
with the GATT rules,'' Wegter added.
   Also the European Commission, the executive committee of the EC,
today condemned the U.S. decision to impose sanctions as ``totally
unjustifiable and contrary to international standards.''
   ``Any country and thus the community has the right to take
measures it judges necessary to protect the health of its
consumers,'' European Commissioner Willy De Clercq said in a
statement from Brussels.
   The Europeans have vowed to hike duties on other U.S. products if
America makes good on its threat to retaliate. U.S. officials pledge
they will counter the counter-retaliation. One proposal being
considered by the U.S. side is a ban on all European meat imports,
worth $450 million a year.
   Officials are predicting that at least the initial ban on meat
containing growth hormones and the 100 percent duties announced by
Yeutter on Tuesday will take effect on Jan. 1 since there are no
talks scheduled before that time.
   However, officials held out hope that the dispute could still be
settled early in 1989.
   In Los Angeles, where President Reagan is vacationing, Deputy
White House Press Secretary Lesley Arsht said the administration had
not lost sight of the fact that the European Community and the
United States are major trading partners and allies.
   ``We have our differences over trade, but there is a mechanism
for resolving them and we have no reason to believe this one won't
be resolved also,'' he said.
   However, the new dispute comes at a time of simmering unhappiness
between America and its European allies.
   The Europeans are upset over continued insistence by both Reagan
and Bush that all countries should scrap trade-distorting farm
subsidies over the next several years. And Americans are worried
that despite denials to the contrary, the European Community will
erect new protectionist barriers blocking American goods as part of
their effort to create a single market for much of Europe by 1992.
   The list of European products upon which the higher 100 percent
duties will be imposed include beef; pork hams and shoulders,
excluding those that have been boned, cooked and packed in airtight
containers; canned tomatoes; instant coffee extracts and wine
coolers containing less than 7 percent alcohol.
   Also subject to the duties will be both fresh and concentrated
fruit juices and pet food packaged for retail sale.
   The United States had originally considered imposing $120 million
in duties, but it lowered the total after the Europeans agreed not
to ban hormone-treated meat that was intended for use as pet food.
   The ban on hormone-treated meat _ which also applies to European
meat producers _ was to have taken effect last Jan. 1, but it was
delayed to allow time for negotiations with Washington and to give
European producers more time to adjust to the ban.
   U.S. officials complain that the Common Market ban would require
a costly new government inspection system to make sure that the
shipments to Europe come from the half of American cattle that are
not treated with growth hormones.
   The Common Market countries are France, Britain, Ireland,
Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, West Germany, Italy,
Greece, Spain and Portugal.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade with soybeans leading the way in
a selloff prompted by badly needed rain overnight in a key Brazilian
soybean state.
   The widespread showers in Parana, which accounts for about 25
percent of Brazil's soybean production, brought ``the best rain to
Brazil in a long time in the state they needed it most,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   He said more rain was forecast for later this week in Brazil and
Argentina, the world's second- and fourth-largest soybean producers,
easing fears about drought damage to the newly planted crop.
   Some new grain sales to China and the Soviet Union provided light
support to the corn and wheat markets, but the soybean losses
dominated the early trading.
   After about a half-hour of trading, wheat was { cent to 1{ cents
lower with the contract for delivery in March at $4.36 a bushel;
corn was \ cent to } cent lower with March at $2.84} a bushel; oats
were \ cent to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.42\ a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents to 6} cents lower with January at $7.92 a

   Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .35 cent lower with February at
74.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .45 cent lower
with January at 84.10 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .20

<HEAD>Announces 1,200 Layoffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. today announced a second round
of layoffs involving 1,200 employees over the next six months, part
of its realignment following the acquisition last year of
Computervision Corp.
   The layoffs, about half involving Massachusetts employees, add to
the reduction of 700 employees announced two months after
Natick-based Prime completed its $435 million takeover of
Computervision in February.
   The latest layoffs combined with a restructuring of its
operations ``are expected to result in savings of approximately $50
million in 1989,'' Anthony L. Craig, Prime president and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
   ``These savings will be in addition to the approximately $50
million in annual operating cost reductions from our continuing
integration of Computervision, and should measurably increase
Prime's operating income in 1989 and beyond,'' he said.
   Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan said the 1,200 layoffs will begin
Jan. 3 and continue over the first two quarters of 1989.
``Generally, they are going to be across all organizations,'' he
said, with the largest impact on home office marketing and support
and the fewest reductions in Prime's direct sales force.
   ``We are talking worldwide,'' Gavaghan said of the layoffs,
``although we expect that more than 50 percent of the reductions
will occur in Massachusetts.''
   About 5,000 of Prime's current workforce of about 12,400 are
employed in Massachusetts at Prime operations in Natick, Bedford and
Framingham. Prime also has oversees operations in the United
Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Italy.
   Gavaghan called the layoffs part of a ``continuation of the
consolidation process resulting from our merger last year with
Computervision. Obviously, you don't take two companies of our
respective sizes and do that overnight.''
   He said the layoffs would effect both former Computervision
employees and pre-takeover Prime employees, as did the previously
announced reduction of 700 workers. ``We are really not using those
designations (anymore),'' he said. ``Our view right now is they are
all Prime employees.''
   Prime will also continue its attrition program, he said. ``But we
don't want to create the inference that the layoffs may be less
because of attrition,'' Cavaghan said. ``That would probably be a
false expectation.''
   The layoffs were announced today as part of a realignment plan
that will place Prime's field sales and service operations into
three geographic business units with separate profit-and-loss
responsibility and further consolidate its marketing, engineering,
manufacturing and adminstration operations.
   A statement from the company said that the reorganization plan
together with other expenses associated with fighting the Tustin,
Calif.-based MAI Basic Four Inc.'s hostile takeover attempt will
result in a non-recurring charge to Prime's operating earnings for
its fourth quarter and fiscal year ending Dec. 31.
   The charge is expected to range from $40 million to $45 million
on a pretax basis, Prime said.

   When one-third of the roof peeled off an Aloha
Airlines jet flying at 24,000 feet eight months ago, it stunned the
aviation community. It could not happen, aircraft engineers and
safety investigators said.
   But it did _ and the Aloha incident and others like it are
changing long-held views on how well jetliners age.
   In October, a large crack was found on a Continental Airlines
jet. And on Monday a 14-inch hole opened up at 31,000 feet on an
aging Eastern Airlines Boeing 727.
   A flight attendant was swept to her death in the Aloha incident,
but everyone else survived as the pilots of the stricken Boeing 737
were able to land it safely. The crack on the Continental jet was
found before it posed any danger, and the Eastern jet landed safely
after an emergency descent and landing at Charleston, W.Va., without
any significant injuries.
   Eastern Airlines said today that a crack was found in the
fuselage of another one of its 727s in ``roughly the same area''
where the hole tore open in the first plane Monday. Eastern
officials in Boston said the Boeing 727 was grounded for repairs at
Logan International Airport after company inspectors discovered the
3-inch crack in the fuselage Monday night.
   But in Scotland, British investigators said today that a bomb
caused the breakup of an 18-year-old Pan American World Airways
jumbo jet last week.
   It is an axiom in the aviation industry that an old jetliner is
not necessarily an unsafe jetliner. But the Eastern incident,
perhaps the Pan Am tragedy and the Aloha and Continental incidents
earlier have prompted federal regulators and the industry _ not to
mention the flying public _ to ponder the question: When is an
airplane too old to fly safely?
   Since l979, the average age of the aircraft fleet belonging to
the major airlines has increased from 10.28 years to 12.53 years,
according to Avmark Inc., an aircraft consulting and appraisal firm.
It is estimated that there are about 2,300 jetliners in service that
were built before l968.
   The commercial jetliner fleet has grown older as airline
executives _ seeing fuel prices drop _ have chosen to keep their
fuel guzzling geriatric jets a little longer, willing to accept the
need for added maintenance costs.
   A new jet can cost from $30 million to $100 million or more,
depending on the model.
   While an aircraft might be old, some have undergone extensive
overhauls.
   Pan Am spokesman Jeffrey Kriendler said the Boeing 747 that
crashed last Wednesday, although 18 years old and the 15th off the
Boeing assembly line, had undergone extensive modifications and
strengthening as recently as mid-l987. As a result, he said ``the
airplane comes out almost brand new.''
   Likewise, Eastern not long ago decided to overhaul its older
Boeing 727s, instead of replacing them. There were indications, in
fact, that the crack that became a hole Monday on Eastern Flight 257
may have occurred at a location where there had been repairs.
   Concern about aging aircraft is not new. In l983 the government
began to require that older aircraft be subject to special
inspections and increased maintenance. The program covers more than
1,000 jetliners, including Boeing 727s, 737s and 747s, as well as
McDonnell Douglas DC-9s and DC-8s.
   As a plane ages ``you should start to expect to see some more
damage occur ... through fatigue and corrosion,'' says Ben Cosgrove,
a vice president for engineering at Boeing. Boeing is about to
conclude an extensive examination of 69 older jets belonging to 43
airlines in 24 countries.
   Preliminary results show that most of the 69 aircraft are ``in
excellent condition,'' although in some cases they are ``below
expectation,'' the aircraft manufacturer observed recently.
   The aircraft industry and the Federal Aviation Administration
believe that as long as old aircraft are closely monitored and
subject to increased maintenance, they will perform safely.
   But critics have suggested more is needed. And since the Aloha
incident last April, many industry experts have begun to agree.
   ``In some cases modification (of the aircraft) is needed, not
just (added) inspection,'' said Cosgrove, acknowledging that this
view represents a change in industry thinking.
   ``Nobody wants anymore Alohas,'' Cosgrove said. As a result of
its recent survey of older aircraft, Boeing has suggested that a
modification or replacement of parts be made part of the routine
maintenance program after an aircraft has reached a certain age even
if there is no specific problem noticeable.
   In perhaps the first official reflection of this new attitude,
the FAA in October directed the replacement of 7,200 rivets on every
older Boeing 737 jetliner to guard against a possible repeat of the
Aloha accident.
   The directive came three weeks after workers at Continental
Airlines discovered a foot-long crack on an aging Continental Boeing
737 during a routine repainting job. The crack apparently had not
been noticed before, even though that aircraft had been among those
subject to special scrutiny because of its age.

   The stock market eked out a small gain today in
quiet yearend trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.21 points to
2,165.89 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 616 up, 570 down and 627
unchanged.
   Analysts said some buying was encouraged by the market's
relatively steady showing lately in the face of continued increases
in interest rates.
   Also, the dollar gained ground against leading foreign currencies
today.
   But market-watchers also observed that it was hard to get a
significant rally going with so many investors having closed down
their activities for the year.
   Tuesday's and last Friday's sessions were the third- and
second-slowest of 1988, and brokers said they didn't look for much
pickup in business until at least next week.
   Quantum Chemical jumped 17 to 105{. The company's directors
approved a recapitalization plan that calls for a $50-a-share
special dividend.
   American Brands fell 2| to 66~. The stock climbed 11~ points
Monday and Tuesday on takeover rumors and speculation.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.17 to 155.75. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .22 at 301.22.

   Federal regulators today announced plans to
rescue the country's largest insolvent savings and loan institution
in a bailout that could cost the government $1.7 billion and a
separate, $5.1 billion aid package to help save five troubled Texas
institutions.
   In the first case, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it had
completed an agreement for the sale of American Savings and Loan
Association of Stockton, Calif., to an investment group headed by
Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass.
   According to the details of the sale, the bank board, which
regulates the country's 3,100 savings and loans, will inject as much
as $1.7 billion in federal aid.
   As costly as the American Savings bailout will turn out to be, it
was dwarfed by the announcement concerning the Texas institutions.
   The bank board said it will provide $5.1 billion in government
assistance over the next 10 years to assist in the takeover of five
of the most financially troubled Texas institutions.
   The Texas S&LS are being taken over by the investment group of
MacAndrews & Forbes Holding Inc., which is headed by Ronald O.
Perelman, the takeover specialist who is the head of Revlon Inc.,
the cosmetics company.
   As costly as the rescue packages will be, bank board chairman M.
Danny Wall said that the cost to the government of simply closing
the insolvent institutions and paying off depositors would have been
far higher.
   In the case of the California institution, Wall estimated the
cost of closing the institution and paying off depositors would have
cost the insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp., $3.3 billion, compared to a cost of $1.7 billion for the sale
to the Bass group.
   With today's actions, the government has resolved the case of 181
failed S&Ls this year, up from 48 last year.
   Wall said today that he still expects to meet his estimate of
settling 200 cases before the end of the year.
   The board is rushing to complete transactions because tax breaks
for institutions getting government assistance will be reduced after
Jan. 1.
   The purchase agreement for American Savings, the country's second
largest S&L and the biggest one that was classified insolvent, will
require the Bass Group to invest $350 million in cash and add
another $150 million over the next three years.
   In return, the government will provide an estimated $1.7 billion
in financial aid.
   Today's announcement culminates months of negotiations between
the bank board and the Bass Group.
   In a statement, Bass said, ``I am delighted that our months of
hard work with the bank board and its staff have resulted in a new
start for American Savings. The employees and customers of American
Savings can start the new year knowing that they are now associated
with one of the healthiest institutions in the country.''
   More than 400 insolvent thrifts remain open and hundreds more are
close to insolvency.
   Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the industry range from $50
billion, made by the bank board, to $112 billion, the recent
estimate by the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of
Congress.
   Even with the rapid pace of rescues in recent week, analysts say
the problem is getting worse by more than $1 billion a month.
   Congress is planning to begin considering a taxpayer bailout of
FSLIC when it convenes in January.

   The dollar advanced sharply Wednesday, partly
reflecting yearend demand for the currency.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was moving up because of
corporate orders for the currency and speculative buying in Tokyo.
Dealers said firmer interest rates in the U.S. credit markets also
helped.
   They discounted a report that U.S. capital spending will increase
by 5.9 percent in 1989 from 1988, another indication that the
economy will continue expanding in the coming year.
   ``The dollar's gains didn't have much to do with the (capital
spending) report,'' said a dealer. ``The dollar's strong anyway.''
   But dealers noted that trading was thin, with many European
dealers and customers on holiday until the New Year. Wednesday was
the first post-Christmas trading day in London, although markets on
the European continent reopened Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.47 yen to a closing 125.27. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 125.80 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in London, compared with late Tuesday's
rates in Europe: 1.7960 West German marks, up from 1.7760; 1.5177
Swiss francs, up from 1.49875; 6.1225 French francs, up from 6.0675;
2.0255 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0050; 1,320.90 Italian lire, up
from 1,308.10; 1.1963 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19575.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7900, compared with $1.8030
in Europe late Tuesday.
   Gold was trading in London at a late bid price of $413.95 a troy
ounce, down from its opening bid of $415.75 and from its closing bid
price last Friday of $417.75.
   In Zurich, the late bid price was $412.25, down from $418.50 bid
late Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid price of $417.45, down
$1.45 from Saturday.
   Silver was quoted in London late Wednesday at a bid price of
$6.07 dollars a troy ounce, down from $6.12 Friday.

<TEXT>
   A private group has committed $315 million to
acquire five insolvent Texas thrifts as part of a $5.1 billion
package, the largest U.S. savings and loan bailout ever, federal
regulators said today.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, prior to the acquisition,
placed all five institutions into receivership. The consolidation
forms the state's largest savings and loan institution and its
fourth largest financial firm, said the board.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will provide a
package worth $5.1 billion to assist the consolidation, said David
Colgren, a board spokesman. He said no taxpayer funds are involved.
The money comes from the FSLIC insurance fund, created from
assessments on savings and loans.
   George Barclay, president and principal supervising agent Federal
Home Loan Bank of Dallas, described the deal as the largest such
bailout in the nation. Barclay said taxpayers won't directly be
affected by FSLIC's action.
   The previous single largest transaction under the so-called
Southwest Plan was the August consolidation of eight insolvent
thrifts, including Sunbelt Savings, into a new Sunbelt Savings. That
deal included a $2.5 billion cash infusion by FSLIC.
   The 2-year-old Southwest Plan was devised by federal thrift
regulators as a way to deal with the savings-and-loan crisis,
centered in Texas with its energy and real estate slump.
   Also today, the bank board said it had completed an agreement for
another takeover _ the sale of American Savings and Loan Association
of Stockton, Calif., to an investment group headed by Texas
billionaire Robert M. Bass. That deal totals as much as $1.7 billion
in FSLIC funds.
   Investors in the $5.1 billion takeover are banker Gerald J. Ford,
chairman of Ford Bank Group in Dallas, along with MacAndrews and
Forbes Holdings Inc. of New York, a private investment group whose
chairman is Ronald O. Perelman, according to a board statement.
   The savings and loans being acquired are First Texas Savings
Association and Montfort Federal Savings and Loan Association, both
in Dallas; Gibraltar Savings Association and Home Savings and Loan
Association, both in Houston; and Killeen Savings and Loan
Association, in Killeen.
   The former offices of the five thrifts opened today as branches
of First Texas Bank F.S.B., and the consolidation should cause no
interruption to depositors, the agency said.
   Bank board officials said Gibraltar, with assets of $6.1 billion,
and First Texas, with $3.5 billion in assets, are among the state's
largest S&Ls. The five thrifts have combined assets of $12.2 billion.
   ``As far as the day-to-day operations, I want to assure you no
changes will take place except for the name on the door,'' Ford said
at a news conference. ``Overnight, we (First Texas) are healthy and
strong and everyone will benefit from this fresh start,'' he said.
   M. Danny Wall, bank board chairman, said the $315 million in the
deal announced today is the largest capital infusion by any
purchaser under the Southwest Plan.
   ``The plan has attracted more than $800 million in new capital to
Texas thrifts this year and that level is quickly approaching the
billion-dollar mark,'' Wall said.
   ``This demonstrates that there is a viable interest in Texas
thrifts, and investors are confident enough in the future of the
thrift industry that they are willing to invest hundreds of millions
of dollars in Texas thrifts.''
   Seventy insolvent Texas thrifts have been merged into 12 under
the Southwest Plan to date.
   The transaction was one of several in a last-minute spree of
Southwest Plan deals expected for this week. Regulators and
purchasers are racing to finish by midnight Saturday, when tax
benefits that lower the costs of the purchases expire.
   ``Federal regulators are continuing to meet with potential
acquirers,'' said Colgren. ``The chairman had said he hoped that we
could resolve somewhere between 15 and 35 thrifts (in Texas) by
yearend, and we are at 20.
   ``Clearly, we continue to meet with acquirers in constructing the
best transactions that balance the needs of the FSLIC and private
industry.''

<HEAD>U.S. Agency Proposes Increased Imports Of British Hog Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department proposed on
Wednesday to reduce import restrictions on shipments of British
swine, pork and pork products to the United States.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the proposal is a result of
Britain's eradication of hog cholera, a contagious and sometimes
fatal disease of swine. He said no case of the disease has been
reported since August 1987.
   The restriction currently require that pork and pork products be
cooked, heated or cured and dried before being shipped from Britain
to ensure that disease organisms were destroyed.
   Under the proposed rule change, small quantities of untreated
pork and pork products for personal consumption will be allowed to
enter the United States from Britain. However, commercial shipments
must orginate only from plants which meet U.S. requirements.
   Glosser said the proposal would affect some U.S. swine producers
who have expressed a desire to import swine breeding stock or semen
from Britain. However, he said, these expected shipments ``would not
have an impact on U.S. swine production.''
   The proposal will be open for public comments until Feb. 27,
after which the department will make a final decision.

<HEAD>Rudolph Giuliani: Prosecutor Who Extracted $650 Million Deal From
Drexel</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY300 of Dec. 28</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   Rudolph Giuliani once said he understood how a
police officer could take a $1,000 bribe to supplement his salary.
   ``What I do not understand is how a guy who's already got a
million dollars defrauds for another hundred thousand or trades
information so his firm can make another $3 million instead of $2
million,'' said Manhattan's U.S. attorney. ``That I do not
understand at all.''
   Don't get him wrong. Giuliani is equally willing _ some would say
eager _ to prosecute cops and CEOs, mafioso bosses and Miss Americas.
   But as he winds up 5{ years as prosecutor in the nation's busiest
courthouse, Giuliani has perhaps become best known as the Eliot Ness
of the financial markets, the humorless lawman who put inside trader
Ivan Boesky out of business and frightened junk-bond financier
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. into a record $650 million plea bargain
for securities fraud.
   ``I'm sure that there are those who think that I'm a zealot who
doesn't have a real appreciation of the way the marketplace
operates,'' Giuliani said. ``And there are those who think I'm doing
a good job, that I'm straightening out a systemic problem that
others haven't confronted ...''
   There are many who think that a barrage of high-profile cases
have put the 44-year-old Brooklyn native in a perfect position to
run for office.
   Giuliani won't discuss the matter, though he says he will leave
his job shortly. In the aftermath of the Bess Myerson divorce-fixing
trial _ a rare defeat _ he was asked whether the acquittal of the
former Miss America beauty queen would hurt him politically. He
dismissed the question as ``irrelevant.''
   Giuliani was an assistant U.S. attorney in the Manhattan office
in the 1970s; it was he who convinced New York City Detective Robert
Leuci to admit to crimes committed with his partners, thus opening
up the city police scandal that was dramatized in the film ``Prince
of the City.''
   Two tours at the Justice Department in Washington followed,
separated by four years in private practice. In 1983, he was
associate attorney general for criminal prosecutions _ the
third-ranking position in the department.
   Then, though it appeared to be a demotion, he took the New York
job. ``This is a job I always wanted to do,'' he said.
   In short order, Giuliani became the town's most talked about
federal prosecutor since Thomas Dewey made a name for himself
busting racketeers in the 1930s.
   He personally prosecuted the first case to come out of the city's
corruption scandals _ the trial that resulted in the convictions of
Bronx Democratic boss Stanley Friedman and others.
   He went after organized crime, artfully using racketeering
statutes to convict the heads of all five of New York's crime
families. In the ``Pizza Connection'' case, his office broke open a
huge ring that distributed heroin.
   In fact, when Giuliani turned his attention to the financial
world, the Wall Street Journal offered ``every encouragement for him
to make his name pursuing the Mafia rather than trying to expand the
law of insider trading.''
   Giuliani defends the insider trading cases. At the margins, he
says, the law may be nebulous, but the cases his office brought ``we
believe constitute the most egregious core of insider trading.''
   Dennis Levine was the first major target. The former managing
director of Drexel Burnham Lambert pleaded guilty to charges of
securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury and was sentenced to two
years in prison after admitting he made millions by trading on
secret information about corporate takeovers.
   Levine fingered Boesky; the speculator pleaded guilty to
conspiring to make false statements to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, received a three-year sentence and agreed to cooperate
with prosecutors.
   There were other indictments, pleas and deal-cutting, leading to
Drexel Burnham's historic plea bargain on Dec. 21 after an intensive
two-year investigation of the nation's fifth-largest securities
firm. It agreed to pay $650 million in fines and restitution and
plead guilty to six felony counts.
   Giuliani's success was such that he once was offered the top post
at the SEC; he turned it down.
   But there have been missteps, as well. In February 1987, federal
agents swooped into the offices of two major Wall Street firms and
seized three executives, charging them with insider trading. The
charges were later dropped, and though Giuliani said they would be
reinstituted, they never were.
   That incident, according to Giuliani's critics, is typical of the
prosecutor's craving for publicity. They say he cares more about
media attention than about justice; they point to the the occasion
when Giuliani and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato disguised themselves as
lowlifes, bought drugs in upper Manhattan and then held a news
conference.
   Lawyers in the Myerson case _ in which she and boyfriend Carl
Capasso were acquitted of conspiring with a judge to have Capasso's
alimony reduced _ say Miss Myerson's fame inspired the case.
   ``Had it not been Bess Myerson, Giuliani would have never brought
this case,'' said Capasso lawyer Jay Goldberg. ``It was no good from
the start.''
   Giuliani denies that prosecution takes a back seat to publicity
in his office. He points to the bottom line: prosecutors in the
Southern District of New York have won 90 percent of their cases
during his watch.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower in light volume Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade,
pulled down by late weakness in the soybean oil market.
   Traders said heavy buying of soybeans and soybean meal by Cargill
Inc. helped keep those markets from falling even further in sympathy
with soybean oil.
   After opening lower in reaction to badly needed rainfall in the
Brazilian soybean country, the grain and soybean markets steadied
and turned mixed on technical factors.
   Soybeans for delivery in January traded as high as $7.99 a bushel
but buying enthusiasm faded when traders failed to push the price
through resistance at $8.
   ``I think that's the fifth time we've tried to get through and
couldn't,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The oil sold off sharply late and the weakness in the oil just
pulled the whole thing down,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 3 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.35{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
lower to 2\ cents higher with March at $2.83} a bushel; oats were 2
cents to 4\ cents lower with March $2.38{ a bushel; soybeans were 2
cents to 6} cents lower with January at $7.90 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Ale and Carol Janssen have a home where
the buffalo roam.
   A pen behind their house in Pinckney is home to 11 of the shaggy
critters who once thundered across the American plains. Another 11
graze at their 200-acre farm in Kalkaska, further north.
   These reminders of the Old West are not for show. They're for
supper, said Janssen, who now eats buffalo instead of beef and
markets what he doesn't eat.
   ``The supply (is low) and demand is great. There's not enough in
existence,'' Janssen said.
   The public is acquiring a taste for buffalo, the Janssens say.
   ``It tastes like a good grade of beef,'' Mrs. Janssen said,
noting buffalo meat is lower in fat and higher in protein than beef.
``If somebody would give it to you and didn't tell you, you'd say,
`this is delicious.'''
   Janssen said he got into the buffalo business in 1976 with three
animals he ordered after seeing a herd near Sterling, Colo. By 1991,
he plans to have a herd of 60.
   The grass-grazing animals need less care than cattle, but require
more caution because of their size, he said. The bull in his herd is
six feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 2,600 pounds.
   ``They do dominate their aens raise the buffalo for slaughter, a
6-month-old calf has become Mrs. Janssen's friend.
   The 200-pound calf, called Charlie, was born with a fractured hip
and was cared for by Michigan State University veterinary students
for a month. When he was returned to his mother, the cow rejected
him so Mrs. Janssen feeds him goat's milk from a bottle.
   Although young Charlie someday will tip the scales at 1,600
pounds or more, for now he nuzzles Mrs. Janssen and tries to lick
her face.
   The Janssens are among 45 Michigan farmers who are members of the
National Buffalo Association, according to Kim Dowling, editor of
the group's ``Buffalo!'' magazine.
   Michigan is home to more than 1,000 privately owned buffalo, she
said.
   Huge herds once crisscrossed the plains, but the numbers of the
beasts had shrunk to 540 in the late 1800s, Dowling said. Public
concern over the future of the creatures prompted state and federal
parks to begin building herds in the 1920s and 1930s, she said.
   Americans began raising buffalo for slaughter in the 1950s and
now 60,000 are held in private herds nationwide, Dowling said.
Another 20,000 belong to public herds at state and federal public
parks.
   The National Buffalo Association claims about 1,000 members
nationwide, Dowling said, including 37 restaurants that feature
buffalo on their menus.
   One of those is Dominique's in Washington, which offers buffalo
sausage with fresh mushrooms and bordelaise sauce as an appetizer
for $7.95.
   ``People aren't afraid of it, ns, she said.
   Janssen's buffalo end up in the meat case at Janssen's party
store in Owendale, Mich., run by his brother, George.
   One buffalo yields at least 800 pounds of burgers, steaks and
roasts, said Audene Janssen, George's wife. Ground buffalo sells for
$3.39 a pound, she said.
   The association's magazine reports sale prices of buffalo, which
Carol Janssen said the family uses as a guide in setting the price
for the meat they sell.
   Janssen said he's yet to turn a profit on his herd and won't be
able to make a living from buffalo until his herd grows.
   In the meantime, Janssen said the animals are a mini-tourist
attraction, with passersby stopping to photograph them.
   ``When they get to running and jumping and the children start to
laugh, that makes it all worthwhile,'' he said.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Quick Fed Action Softened 1987 Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
said Wednesday that last year's historic stock market crash ``was an
accident waiting to happen,'' but quick central-bank action softened
its impact.
   ``History teaches us that central banks have a crucial role to
play in responding to such episodes of acute financial distress,''
he said in prepared remarks to the American Economic Association.
   Greenspan said that before the Federal Reserve System was founded
75 years ago interest rates rose sharply and credit availability was
greatly curtailed during ``stock market crashes or their
equivalent.''
   ``These (high) rates were a product of natural market reactions
to the dramatic increases in uncertainty that accompanied such
episodes,'' he said.
   But Greenspan said after the Oct. 19, 1987 stock market crash,
the Fed clearly managed to shrink ``irrational reactions in the
financial system to an irreducible minimum'' by adding liquidity to
the financial system for the next two weeks.
   ``Rather than the spikes in rates observed in panics earlier in
our history, short-term rates actually declined after October 19,
even on private instruments,'' Greenspan said.
   Greenspan said the Fed still kept a watchful eye on inflation,
being ``cautious to attack the problem that existed, and not cause
one that didn't.''
   ``A central issue through all the turmoil of 14 months ago and
since has been the cause of the market collapse and especially the
reasons for its suddeness,'' he said.
   Undoubtedly, he said, the crash will ``provide raw material for a
steady flow of doctoral dissertations for years to come.''
   Greenspan said the crash was brought about by overbought market
conditions and computerized program trading, a strategy enabling
institutional investors to make lightning-quick trades of huge
amounts of stocks and index futures to profit from price disparities.
   ``Something had to snap,'' Greenspan said. ``If it didn't happen
in October, it would have happened soon thereafter. The market
plunge was an accident waiting to happen.''

   The dollar rose sharply against most key foreign
currencies in thin worldwide trading Wednesday, partly due to
yearend demand and speculation of higher U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices retreated. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold bullion was bid at $413.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down
$4 from late Tuesday.
   Foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar's advance came largely
from corporate orders for the currency and speculative buying in
Tokyo. The prospects for higher interest rates in the United States
also helped, they said.
   But since trading remained extremely quiet, with many dealers on
holiday until after New Year's Day, any movement might have been
exaggerated, dealers said.
   ``I call this a technical rally in a very thin market,'' said
Earl I. Johnson, a dealer with Harris Trust & Co. in Chicago.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.47 yen to 125.27 yen. The dollar was quoted at
125.80 yen in London. Later in New York it stood at 125.68 yen, up
from 124.935 late Tuesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7900, compared with $1.8030
in Europe late Tuesday. Wednesday was the first post-Christmas
trading day in London, although markets on the European continent
reopened Tuesday.
   Sterling fetched $1.7885 in New York, down from $1.8023.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.7905 West German marks, up from 1.7775; 1.5135
Swiss francs, up from 1.4990; 1.19285 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19725; 6.1115 French francs, up from 6.07125; and 1,317.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,309.25.
   Late dollar rates in London, compared with Tuesday: 1.7960 West
German marks, up from 1.7760; 1.5177 Swiss francs, up from 1.49875;
6.1225 French francs, up from 6.0675; 2.0255 Dutch guilders, up from

Dividend</HEAD>

   Quantum Chemical Corp., which has undertaken a
series of steps to increase the value of its stock over the past
year, on Wednesday announced the latest move, a $1.1 billion
recapitalization plan that includes a one-time, $50-per-share
dividend.
   The news sent Quantum's shares soaring on Wall Street as
investors rushed to take advantage of the dividend to be paid Jan.
10. Quantum stock rose $18.62{ a share to $107.12{ in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Quantum said its board of directors approved the recapitalization
and dividend, as well as plans to sell the company's oleochemicals
business. Proceeds of the sale were to go toward the cost of the
recapitalization, the company said in a statement.
   Quantum Chairman John Hoyt Stookey said the recapitalization was
``designed to unlock value for our shareholders'' while allowing
Quantum to continue a $1.3 billion capital expenditure plan.
   A source close to the company said the recapitalization was not
being undertaken as a defensive move.
   Fred Siemer, a chemical industry analyst with Chemical Research,
said, ``the company has had a policy of trying to maximize
shareholder value ever since Stookey took over,'' and that the
announcement was consistent with that policy.
   Siemer said he was unaware of any possible bids for the company,
but said in today's takoever climate, ``That's always possible.''
   The company, which changed its name to Quantum Chemical a year
ago from National Distillers and Chemical Corp., sold off its wine
and spirits business _ including brands such as Gilbey's gin and
Almaden wines _ to focus on its chemical and energy segments.
   The asset sales were part of the company's plans to increase the
value of its stock, Siemer said.
   The company also increased the value of its shares following the
October 1987 Wall Street crash by buying back approximately
one-third of its outstanding stock.
   The company now has 22.8 million outstanding shares.
   Quantum said it would finance the recapitalization through $1.15
billion in bridge loans that would be repaid partly through
publicly-offered debt securities and bank loans totaling nearly $900
million.
   Additionally, the company said its employee stock ownership plan
would borrow $100 million to purchase Quantum shares.
   Quantum's main businesses include petrochemicals and propane
marketing.

   Stock prices crept ahead Wednesday in a quiet
yearend session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 3.75 to 2,166.43.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
790 up, 607 down and 571 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 110.63 million
shares, against 87.49 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 136.28 million shares.
   Analysts said some buying was encouraged by the market's
relatively steady showing lately in the face of continued increases
in interest rates. Also, the dollar gained ground against leading
foreign currencies.
   But market-watchers also observed that it was hard to get a
significant rally going with so many investors having closed down
their activities for the year.
   Tuesday's and last Friday's sessions were the third- and
second-slowest of 1988, and brokers said they didn't look for much
pickup in business until at least next week.
   With two sessions left before New Year's, the Dow Jones
industrials sports a gain of 227.60 points, or 11.74 percent, since
last Jan. 1.
   That ranks as a slightly above-average showing, by the historical
standard of 9 percent to 10 percent annual gains for stocks.
   Quantum Chemical jumped 18| to 107[. The company's directors
approved a recapitalization plan that calls for a $50-a-share
special dividend.
   Dallas Corp. posted the day's biggest percentage advance among
NYSE stocks, up 3] at 16{. The company declined to comment on the
activity.
   Athlone Industries climbed 3\ to 33. The company reported plans
to transfer the assets of its Jessop Steel subsidiary to a new
limited partnership.
   American Brands fell 2} to 66}. The stock climbed 12 points
Monday and Tuesday on takeover rumors and speculation.
   There were signs of buying by traders hoping for a bounce in
depressed lower-priced issues once the pressure of yearend tax
selling is lifted off the market at the end of this week.
   For example, Reebok International gained { to 11[; Cooper Cos. ]
to 5{, and Floating Point Systems \ to 2}.
   In the blue-chip sector, McDonald's rose \ to 47]; International
Paper \ to 45[; American Express [ to 26~, and Exxon [ to 45[.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.98 billion, or 0.15
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.23 to 155.81.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .31 to 320.49, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .25 at 277.08.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.12 to 376.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 302.14, up .70.

   Centaur Partners said Wednesday it would press
ahead with its spurned $765 million takeover bid for Pennwalt Corp.,
while the chemical maker's management denounced the pursuers and
their investment banker as greedy Wall Street raiders.
   In a statement, the partnership said it still sought a meeting
with Pennwalt executives to discuss a friendly merger.
   On Tuesday, the Philadelphia-based company's board called
Centaur's $100-a-share offer ``completely unacceptable.''
   Pennwalt listed several reasons for the rejection, including the
success of the firm's restructuring program and its future
prospects. The board also considered the ``large number of
significant uncertainties'' in the Centaur offer, the statement said.
   In a letter to Pennwalt shareholders, Chairman Edwin E. Tuttle
called Centaur's offer ``illusory'' and said it was ``not intended
to succeed.'' He said Centaur only wanted to realize a short-term
profit.
   Tuttle issued a further statement late Wednesday reiterating the
company's determination not to negotiate with Centaur, and he
rebuked PaineWebber Inc. for providing financing for the
partnership's bid.
   ``It is unfortunate that the greed on Wall Street has led a
once-prominent investment banking firm like PaineWebber to join in
partnership with the likes of these people,'' Tuttle said.
   Earlier Wednesday, Centaur accused Tuttle of ``resorting to
name-calling.''
   ``Despite Mr. Tuttle's assertions, our offer is intended to
succeed,'' Centaur said.
   Centaur, whose principals are New York financiers Abbey J. Butler
and Melvyn J. Estrin, owns 12.7 percent of Pennwalt's outstanding
shares.
   The partners said they wanted to meet with Tuttle and other
Pennwalt officers `to consummate a merger that is beneficial to
Pennwalt and its shareholders, to avoid costly and protracted
litigation and to demonstrate our comitment to acquriing Pennwalt.''
   Centaur was referring to litigation brought by Pennwalt to block
the bid.

   A Texas banker in the investment group that
acquired five insolvent Texas savings and loans Wednesday said he
sees a trend toward all-purpose banks, combining commercial and
residential lending.
   ``I think that's the direction you see most financial
institutions taking now,'' said Gerald J. Ford, chairman and chief
executive officer of the Ford Bank Group in Dallas. ``We will still
work in the traditional sense of the savings and loan.''
   The acquisition of the five savings and loans is the bank group's
first venture with thrifts. The private group committed $315 million
to acquire the thrifts as part of a $5.1 billion package, the
largest bailout ever in the nation's depressed savings and loan
industry, federal regulators said.
   Ford will act as chairman of the board and chief executive
officer of the new 127-branch First Texas Bank, F.S.B., overseeing
operations of the largest savings institution in Texas and
fourth-largest financial entity in the state.
   The five thrifts involved are First Texas Savings Association and
Montfort Federal Savings and Loan Association, both in Dallas;
Gibraltar Savings Association and Home Savings and Loan Association,
both in Houston; and Killeen Savings and Loan Association, in
Killeen.
   Ford also is president and chief executive of United New Mexico
Financial Corp.
   Since 1975, Ford has acquired several troubled financial
institutions, instituting stronger management controls. One of
Ford's acquisitions is United National Bank of Dallas where he is
chairman of the board.
   MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings Inc. of New York, a private
investment group chaired by takeover strategist Ronald O. Perelman,
is the majority holder in the deal worked out with Federal Home Loan
Bank of Dallas.
   ``We have the people and the program in place to build the
pre-eminent financial institution in the state of Texas,'' said
Ford. ``As the regional economy recovers, as we expect it will,
First Texas will play a major role in assisting in the
revitalization of the communities in which we do business.
   ``Our management team has extensive experience in Texas,
including a history of successfully managing troubled financial
institutions,'' said Ford. ``First Texas Bank will be guided by
prudent, conservative management principles and strict financial
controls.''

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Plunge; Thin Market Blamed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices fell more than $20 an ounce Wednesday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange but analysts said the plunge was
due more to thin trading conditions than to bearish
supply-and-demand developments.
   Futures prices of other precious metals also declined.
   On other markets, coffee futures rebounded from Tuesday's steep
losses; grains, soybeans and energy futures were mostly lower;
livestock and meat futures were mixed; and stock-index futures
advanced.
   Platinum settled $19.90 to $22.40 lower with the contract for
delivery in January at $510.50 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures had been mostly on the rise since Dec. 19, the
last day of a 3-day collapse sparked by Ford Motor Co.'s
announcement of a platinum-free catalytic converter. The use of
platinum in the automobile pollution-control devices accounts for
about a third of world platinum consumption.
   The Ford announcement continues to overhang the market and
Wednesday's strength in the dollar was a bearish signal for all the
precious metals, some analysts said.
   But they agreed that platinum's losses Wednesday were exaggerated
by thin, holiday market conditions _ a simple lack of enough traders
to provide much resistance to sharp price swings.
   ``Trading was very light across the board and it was particularly
light in platinum, as is usually the case,'' said Bette Raptopoulos,
an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Confidence appeared to have been building in the platinum market
following assurances from platinum producers that Ford's new
converter would not significantly reduce demand for the metal for
several years.
   But the recent rally, totaling about $15 an ounce, ``was a rather
fragile recovery,'' said Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Josephthal
& Co. in New York.
   Cardillo said Wednesday's plunge left the platinum market
technically vulnerable to further losses, with no strong resistance
likely above $503 an ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $4.10 to $4.80
lower with February at $416.60 a troy ounce; silver was 6.1 cents to
6.8 cents lower with March at $6.188 a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange on rumors that a financially troubled Brazilian exporter
would fail to meet shipping commitments, said Kim Badenhop, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   Coffee futures hit a 2-year high of $1.59 a pound last week but
prices fell sharply on Tuesday following reports of drenching rain
in the drought-stricken Brazilian coffee country.
   Badenhop the coffee price outlook remained bullish despite the
rain.
   ``The rain will not increase prospects for the crop,'' he said.
``If anything, it will just stabilize the losses.
   Coffee settled 3.75 cents to 5.77 cents higher with March at
$1.5204 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices ended mostly lower in light
volume on the Chicago Board of Trade, pulled down by late weakness
in the soybean oil market.
   But sales, announced after the close, of 600,000 metric tons of
both soybean meal and corn to the Soviet Union should ensure a
higher opening on Thursday, traders said.
   Besides those sales, the Agriculture Department announced sales
of 100,000 metric tons of meal and 200,000 metric tons of corn to
unknown destinations, which probably meant the Soviets, observers
said.
   ``The corn is no big deal but that's a lot of meal,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``I
think this is going to pop us up pretty good.''
   Wheat settled { cent to 3{ cents lower with March at $4.35} a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with March at
$2.84 a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 4\ cents lower with March
$2.38{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents lower with January
at $7.89{ a bushel.
   Energy futures finished mostly lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents lower to 2
cents higher with February at $16.97 a barrel; heating oil was .15
cent to .28 cent lower with January at 53.49 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .43 cent to .53 cent higher with January at
47.04 cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .25 cent
to .50 cent lower with February at 73.97 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with January at 84.30
cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent lower to .22 cent higher with
February at 47.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .27 cent
to 1 cent lower with February at 43.10 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures posted slight gains on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .35 point higher at 280.35. Each point is
worth $500.

<TEXT>
   Ownership of a north-central Washington lumber
and plywood mill was turned over to its 635 workers Wednesday after
union representatives, corporate officials and financiers meeting in
New York closed a $50 million employee buyout deal.
   ``Oh, man! Just like a dream came true, an impossible dream came
true,'' said Lloyd Groomes, business manager for Local 3023 of the
Lumber, Plywood and Industrial Workers Union, which initiated the
buyout effort last summer.
   ``We've been given a great gift this Christmas _ the gift of
opportunity _ the chance to control our economic destiny,'' Groomes
said.
   The employees beat out several Fortune 500 companies in
purchasing Omak Wood Products from international financier Sir James
Goldsmith, who had acquired the mill in 1985 as part of his purchase
of Crown Zellerbach Co.
   ``This proves that employees can obtain the financing necessary
to acquire profitable companies,'' said Fred McCarthy, a managing
director for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment firm that
represented the union in negotiations with Goldsmith.
   McCarthy said the Omak buyout is the first in which workers buy a
healthy company, maintain a majority ownership and use a significant
amount of high-yield, high-risk ``junk bonds'' for financing.
   ``We've had employee buyouts of sick companies, and of healthy
companies with financing from banks, but none I can think of (in
which) those three elements of majority ownership, a healthy company
and more financing than banks could provide, are combined,'' he said.
   The employees will own almost 60 percent of the new company
through an employee stock ownership plan. Goldsmith retained a 10
percent share ``to make the purchase price easier and as a show of
faith'' in the employee plan, said Al Dunlap, president and chief
executive officer of Goldsmith's operations.
   The rest of the stock will be owned by investors.
   Drexel will act as private placement agent for about $50 million
required to buy the company and to provide working capital.
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, in a statement from his Olympia
office, congratulated the workers and pledged continued state
support to help the venture succeed.

<HEAD>AT&T Files Dumping Petition Against Foreign Phone Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. on Wednesday
formally asked the Commerce Department to investigate charges that
manufacturers in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are setting unfairly
low prices on their small-business phone equipment marketed in the
United States.
   AT&T, which said earlier this month that it would seek an
investigation, set out its accusations of unfair competition in a
petition, accusing more than a dozen manufacturers that sell
products under more than 17 brand names.
   Under U.S. law, it is illegal for foreign companies to sell
products in the U.S. market for less than they sell them at home.
AT&T said the foreign companies' prices in their home markets were
an average 75 percent higher than their prices in the U.S. market,
and in one case 170 percent higher.
   The petition involves equipment for small businesses with two to
80 phone lines. The two major types are known as key systems and
private branch exchanges, or PBXs. AT&T's General Business Systems
is the largest U.S. manufacturer of these products.
   The Commerce Department has 20 days in which to decide whether to
investigate AT&T's charges. If it initiates an investigation, the
International Trade Commission will begin a separate probe to
determine whether the alleged ``dumping'' has harmed the U.S.
industry and will make a preliminary finding within 45 days.
   Final determinations by both the department and the commission
and possible imposition of anti-dumping duties would occur in about
a year.
   The Japanese companies named in the petition are: Hasegawa,
Iwatsu, Matsushita, Maisei, Nakayo, Nitsuko, Tamura and Toshiba.
   Also named were South Korea's Goldstar, OPC and Samsung and
Taiwan's Sun Moon Star.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Savings emerged from a federal
bailout Wednesday propped up by $1.7 billion in government
insurance, forbidden to put much of its wealth into aggressive
investments and run by a conservative thrift industry veteran.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board sold American, the nation's
second-biggest thrift, to the Robert M. Bass group of Fort Worth,
Texas, for $350 million cash.
   The investment group promised to inject at least $150 million
more into the insolvent thrift over the next three years. And the
bank board agreed to supply up to $1.7 billion in federal aid from
the industry-financed insurance fund, the Federal Savings & Loan
Insurance Corp.
   The new institution, with a federal charter, is called American
Savings Bank.
   American, insolvent and burdened with debt blamed on overly
aggressive expansion and risky real-estate loans and direct
investments, was seized by the bank board in September from its old
owner, Financial Corp. of America.
   The board kept the bank open through tortuous negotiations with
Bass, running 186 branches in California, and has tried to retain
customers by guaranteeing deposits even beyond the normal $100,000
FSLIC insurance limit.
   One facet of the agreement represents a setback of sorts for the
Bass group, which had sought permission to put up to 10 percent of
American's assets into a so-called merchant bank which could fund
corporate takeovers.
   That plan drew fire from state regulators, elected officials and
thrift executives who maintained that it was American's aggressive
management that got the company into trouble in the first place.
   The merchant bank idea has been replaced, the bank board said,
with permission to put up to 3 percent of the company's assets in a
subsidiary called Stockton Capital Corp. that will be allowed to buy
or invest in profitable companies.
   Apparently in return for concessions from Bass on the merchant
bank, the bank board reduced the amount of cash the investor group
must initially pump into American to $350 million from $550 million.
   The new institution is run by Mario Antoci, formerly
second-in-command at H.F. Ahmanson, the nation's biggest thrift
holding company and one generally described by analysts as
conservative and well-run.
   Antoci, 54, was named chairman and chief executive officer of New
American Holdings Inc., the new, Bass-controlled holding company for
the thrift.
   His appointment was greeted in the industry as a signal Bass
intends to run American along traditional thrift lines, focusing on
home mortgages.
   ``He's a good, conservative banker,'' said an approving William
Callender, president and chief executive officer of California
Federal Savings & Loan Association.
   ``It appears to send a signal to the market that the institution
is going to be run in a conservative and traditional fashion,''
added Bob Adelizzi, president of San Diego-based Home Federal
Savings & Loan. ``I think that bodes well for (American's) future
health.''
   The rescue plan outlined Wednesday by the government and the Bass
group splits American into two institutions:
   A so-called ``good bank,'' called American Savings Bank, will run
the branches and oversee the loans and investments that continue to
make money. A ``bad bank,'' called New West Federal Savings & Loan
Association, was formed specifically to sell off foreclosed loans,
unprofitable real estate investments and other bad assets.
   The ``good bank'' will have assets of $15.7 billion, making it
the sixth-largest S&L in the country. With $30.1 billion in assets,
the old American was the nation's second-biggest thrift., behind
Ahmanson's Home Savings of America.
   The old holding company, Financial Corp. of America, is being
liquidated in bankruptcy court, and trustee David Gill has said it
is likely stockholders in FCA will lose their entire investments.
   Headquarters for the new holding company remain in Irvine and the
savings and loan will continue to be run out of Stockton.

   Eastern Airlines on Wednesday said an inspection of
46 older Boeing 727s found one with a 3-inch fuselage crack in
roughly the same spot as a tear that forced a jet to make an
emergency landing in Charleston, W.Va.
   The plane was grounded at Boston's Logan International Airport,
and later Wednesday, Eastern maintenance workers in Miami found
apparent corrosion near rivets on another 727, company spokeswoman
Karen Ceremsak said. She said paint was being removed from the area
late Wednesday and no other details were available.
   Apparent cracks were found in an out-of-service Eastern DC-9 in
Atlanta, Ms. Ceremsak said. That discovery was not related to the
Boeing 727 inspection, but resulted from an earlier industrywide
directive from the Federal Aviation Administration and
McDonnell-Douglas, the manufacturers, to check all DC-9 aircraft
with 55,000 flights, she said.
   An FAA official said airlines soon will be asked to replace
rivets in more than 800 727s that were made with what is now
considered an outmoded bonding process.
   Darrell Pederson, an FAA assistant manager in Seattle, where
Boeing is based, said the agency was ``very close'' to issuing a
notice of proposed rule-making, which can be followed by an
airworthiness directive after some time for public comment.
   A similar directive was issued after a 20-foot section tore loose
from an Aloha Airlines 737 jet in midflight in April, sending a
flight attendant to her death, Pederson said.
   Under that directive, airlines had to replace more than 7,000
rivets on at least 100 older Boeing 737s at a cost of about $8
million. In addition, altitude and other restrictions were imposed
pending inspection for cracks.
   Eastern ordered its 727s to be checked visually as a precaution
after the emergency landing Monday morning. A 14-inch hole opened at
the rear of the cabin roof at 31,000 feet, causing the 22-year-old
Boeing 727 to lose pressure.
   The airline also plans a more sophisticated, electrical-current
inspection of its Boeing fleet. ``We'll use electrical current
seeking out any imperfections, beginning tonight,'' Ms. Ceremsak
said. ``This is on our own initiative.''
   The checks can be carried out during normal maintenance and will
be completed in about a month, without disrupting service, she said.
   A crack in a 24-year-old Eastern jet was discovered Monday,
Eastern said in announcing the visual inspections were completed.
The plane was one of the first 727s made.
   ``That plane was taken out of service for repairs,'' said carrier
spokesman Robin Matell. ``All the rest are flying normally.''
   National Transportation Safety Board inspectors arrived in Boston
on Wednesday to examine the plane.
   Ms. Ceremsak said the airline anticipates changes in its
procedures when the NTSB issues its findings on the emergency
landing of Monday's Rochester-to-Atlanta flight. Two people among
the 110 aboard suffered minor injuries.
   ``I'm sure we will be revising our maintenance program in keeping
with the findings, but it would be premature to say what changes we
will make,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.
   In Atlanta, Delta Air Lines said it plans to inspect the fuselage
of each of its Boeing 727 jets.
   Delta spokesman Jim Lundy said the ``assurance-type inspections''
are being conducted in consultation with Boeing and Eastern and are
strictly a precaution. Delta has experienced no similar problems,
and the airline's 130 Boeing 727 jets are all from the newer 727-200
series, with an average age of 11.76 years, he said.
   In Charleston, Eastern mechanics on Wednesday were set to repair
the 14-by-10-inch hole in the fuselage. Some material was to be
taken to NTSB headquarters in Washington for analysis.
   Some experts have speculated the tear was caused by metal
fatigue, but Ms. Ceremsak said Eastern would await the NTSB report.
She said the repaired plane was expected to be flown back to Atlanta
or Miami on Thursday.
   Some of the 104 passengers complained that their oxygen masks
failed to work when the cabin lost pressure, but Ms. Ceremsak said
many of those aboard had failed to pull down on the masks hard
enough to trigger the oxygen flow.
   ``We went back and tested the masks, and they all deployed,'' she
said.
   The emergency landing and grounded plane were just two incidents
in a string of Eastern problems this week.
   On Sunday, an Eastern A300 bound for Newark, N.J., had to return
to Miami International Airport because of an engine problem. On
Tuesday, a Fort Lauderdale-bound A300 turned back to New York's
LaGuardia Airport after a problem with a door prevented the plane
from being properly pressurized.
   Also Tuesday, an Eastern plane clipped a parked private plane at
the Key West airport while taxiing and passengers were put on
another flight.

   Nissan Motor Corp. USA announced Wednesday
that it will raise prices on its 1989 cars and trucks because of the
increasing strength of the Japanese yen against the dollar.
   Car and truck prices will go up an average of 3 percent, or $388,
on Jan. 4, said Robert J. Thomas, vice president and general manager
of Nissan USA.
   The automaker had taken several steps to offset the impact of the
changing exchange rate, Thomas said.
   ``However, the continued weakening of the dollar has forced us to
raise our prices,'' he said in a news release.
   A higher yen makes Japanese products more expensive in relation
to U.S. products and discourages consumers from buying them. The
higher prices help the automaker compensate for slower sales.

^Regulators OK $6.8 Billion Bailout of S&Ls</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In two of the largest savings and loan bailouts
yet, federal regulators announced agreements Wednesday to provide
$6.8 billion in government aid to rescue the nation's largest
insolvent S&L and to assist in the takeover of five problem thrift
institutions in Texas.
   The rescue packages involved American Savings and Loan
Association of Stockton, Calif., the nation's second-largest S&L and
the biggest one that is classified as insolvent, and a group of five
of the most troubled S&Ls in Texas.
   The Texas S&Ls were being taken over by the investment group of
MacAndrews & Forbes Holding Inc., which is led by Ronald O.
Perelman, the takeover specialist who is head of the Revlon
cosmetics firm.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's
3,000 S&Ls, agreed to provide $5.1 billion in government assistance
over the next 10 years. In return, the Perelman group agreed to
contribute $315 million of its own funds to buy the five Texas S&Ls.
   The latest Texas package represented the second largest amount of
government aid ever extended. It was exceeded only by $5.5 billion
in assistance provided in the merger of Sunbelt Savings Association
and seven other Texas institutions last August.
   In the other billion-dollar-plus transaction announced Wednesday,
the bank board pledged to provide an estimated $1.7 billion in
government assistance over the next three years in the sale of
American Savings to a group headed by Texas billionaire Robert M.
Bass.
   The Bass group will put up $350 million in cash and add $150
million over the next three years.
   The three-member bank board met late into the night Wednesday as
the agency raced the clock to finish as many deals as possible
before Jan. 1 when the tax breaks to the purchasers of insolvent
S&Ls are reduced.
   In other actions Wednesday the bank board said it was providing:
   _ $4.9 million in government assistance in the the takeover of
the insolvent First Federal Savings and Loan Association of
Columbus, Ga., by Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla. The bank
will invest $31.5 million and operate the S&L as Barnett Federal
Savings Bank.
   _ $66.4 million in government assistance in the takeover of the
insolvent McLean Federal Savings and Loan of Virginia by NVRyan
L.P., a home construction company, which will invest $16 million to
acquire the S&L. The new institution will operate as NVR Federal
Savings Bank.
   _ $59.6 million in government assistance in the takeover of the
insolvent First Financial Savings Bank of Des Moines, Iowa, by
Metropolitan Federal Bank of Iowa, which will operate First
Financial's 10 offices as branches of Metropolitan Federal.
   The latest transactions Wednesday brought to 184 the number of
failed S&Ls with which the bank board has dealt this year, up from
48 last year. Seventy of the institutions have been in Texas, where
financial institutions have suffered because of hard times in the
oil and real estate industries.
   So far this year, the bank board has pledged in excess of $30
billion in government assistance, with an expectation of several
more bailout packages before Sunday when the new year begins.
   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said regulators were working to
complete other deals and it was likely the final total for the year
could reach 200.
   The board is rushing to complete transactions because tax breaks
for the investors getting government assistance will be cut in half
after Jan. 1.
   Private analysts said the size of the latest rescue packages
served to highlight just how serious a problem is facing the new
Bush administration.
   ``The S&L situation is a disaster and it is not going to get
better in a hurry,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist for
Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass. consulting firm. ``This is a
problem that President Bush would be well advised to address fairly
early.''
   Even with the post-Depression record number of cases being
handled this year, more than 400 insolvent S&Ls remain open and
hundreds of others are close to insolvency.
   Estimates of cleaning up the industry range from a low of $50
billion, the current bank board projection, to a high of $112
billion included in the latest report from the General Accounting
Office, the auditing arm of Congress.
   Analysts said the problem is getting worse by $1 billion a month,
putting even more pressure on the new administration to come up with
more government aid so that the sick S&Ls can be dealt with more
quickly, thus easing the final taxpayer tab.
   So far the government assistance has come primarily from special
assessments healthy S&Ls are required to pay to the federal agency
that insures individual deposits up to $100,000.
   However, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which is
an arm of the bank board, is itself technically insolvent, with its
obligations to close or merge sick S&Ls far outweighing the revenue
stream expected from industry fees.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who will be staying on in the
Bush administration, has ordered a study of ways to replenish the
FSLIC fund. He reportedly is searching for a plan that will minize
the impact on the federal budget deficit. FSLIC expenditures count
as federal spending.
   Thus the growing S&L problem is making Bush's campaign pledge to
trim the budget deficit without resorting to new taxes more
difficult to meet.
   Some in Congress have been critical of the bank board rescue
packages, charging that the deals fail to attract enough money from
the investors taking over the failed S&Ls.
   But Wall said Wednesday that the cost to the government of simply
closing the insolvent institutions and paying off depositors up to
the $100,000 maximum provided by law would be far more costly.
   In the case of the latest Texas rescue package, Wall put the cost
of closing the institutions and paying off depositors at $6.8
billion, compared with the $5.1 billion projected government cost of
the merger.
   In the case of American Savings, Wall said the shut-down cost
would have been $3.3 billion, almost double the $1.7 billion the
government expects to pay out in the sale to the Bass group.
   The Texas institutions involved are First Texas Savings
Association and Montfort Federal Savings and Loan Association, both
in Dallas; Gibraltar Savings Association and Home Savings and Loan
Association, both in Houston; and Killeen Savings and Loan
Association, in Killeen.
   Montfort is the former Vernon Savings and Loan Association of
Dallas, which got into trouble for risky lending practices. When the
bank board took over the institution earlier this year, officials
found that 96 percent of its loans were deliquent or non-performing.
   The former offices of the five S&Ls opened Wednesday as branches
of First Texas Bank FSB with no interruption in service to
depositors.

   A stock-profiteering scandal has boosted political
reform to the top of the national agenda, but the jury probably will
be out for months on whether Japan's ``money politics'' will change
significantly.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, vowing to tighten political
discipline, formed a new Cabinet on Tuesday with 15 new members out
of 20. But the balance of political factions was unchanged, and the
leadership of his Liberal Democratic Party stayed the same even
though two of the top three party positions are held by men tainted
by scandal.
   Media commentators were virtually unanimous in saying the Cabinet
reshuffle did not cure the ``Recruit Scandal.''
   ``It is regrettable that we cannot feel any hope for a change,''
the Asahi Shimbun editorial said Wednesday. The newspaper, which
took a leading role in uncovering the scandal, noted that many
prominent politicians who profited by receiving shares in a Recruit
Co. subsidiary stayed in power.
   ``We are concerned that they will cover for each other in any
probe of the scandal,'' the paper said.
   The affair has tarnished Japan's international image, and the new
justice minister, Takashi Hasegawa, 76, told a news conference
Tuesday that the public was losing confidence in politics, business
and public officials.
   ``For Japan to be trusted in the international arena, we have to
start with establishing a trustworthy political system,'' Hasegawa
said.
   But within 24 hours Hasegawa was revealed to have received
regular donations from Recruit Co., including a donation in October
when the scandal was front-page news every day. Over 12 years his
political organization got $46,000 from Recruit, Hasegawa confirmed
in a post-midnight news conference.
   The donations to Hasegawa were legal and quite different from the
stock transactions in a Recruit subsidiary that put many politicians
in hot water, but the belated revelation showed how wide the Recruit
scandal goes.
   The scandal began unfolding last summer with disclosures that the
founder of the Recruit conglomerate, Hiromasa Ezoe, sold
bargain-priced shares in a real-estate subsidiary called
Recruit-Cosmos to politicians or their aides, business leaders and
media figures before the shares were listed.
   The purchases often were financed by loans from another Recruit
subsidiary. When the shares were listed in October 1986 and the
price doubled, shareholders made tax-free profits of up to $150,000.
   The transactions were not illegal, but it is widely assumed that
Ezoe was seeking business advantage and prestige. The astounding
scope of the scandal brought suspicion of something approaching
widespread bribery.
   Former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa heads the roster of 17
politicians and business leaders who resigned in the scandal. A
former Recruit official pleaded guilty to trying to bribe an
opposition parliament member to tone down his investigation.
   Takeshita's poll ratings are sharply down, but his conservative
party is the most firmly entrenched governing party among the
capitalist democracies. It has been in power since World War II with
the exception of 10 months of a socialist Cabinet in 1947-48.
   Japan has become an economic superpower under the Liberal
Democrats, who fostered growth, helped troubled industries modernize
and promoted exports. The business world has demonstrated its
gratitude with generous donations.
   The resulting ``money politics'' caused a huge scandal in the
1970s in the time of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who was convicted
of taking a $1.7 million bribe from the U.S. aircraft maker Lockheed.
   The Liberal Democrats won 304 of 524 seats in the powerful lower
house in the 1986 election, but they still run scared at election
time, and the political appetite for money keeps growing.
   Because the electoral system has multiple-seat constituencies,
several Liberal Democrats may run for the same seat and each
candidate needs lots of money.
   Politicians also say they are victimized by the Japanese custom
of generous gift-giving. They say they need money far beyond their
salary and expense allowance to give lavishly at constituents'
weddings and funerals.
   Takeshita, who was touched by the scandal when an aide profited
from Recruit-Cosmos shares, told a news conference Wednesday he is
setting goals on improving political ethics.
   He said that before next summer's election of half of the upper
house of the Diet, Japan's parliament, some progress will be made,
and he hoped for more progress in 1990.
   The prime minister said reform committees will deal with
political donations and fund-raising parties, and they also will
take a long-term look at the election system.
   ``I support the idea that political reform is at the base of all
problems,'' he said. ``Each politician including myself must always
take into account an ethical platform. If each one takes
precautions, I believe this will be reflected in daily government
affairs. But it is first necessary to create the environment to make
this possible.''
   Analyst Garrett N. Scalera, president of the Tokyo Institute of
Policy Studies, said the Diet probably will outlaw dubious donations
like Recruit-style sales of prelisted shares, but he thought reform
would end there.
   ``If you're talking about political reform in the sense of Diet
members not taking money from business or farming organizations,
it's really impossible, it's too radical a reform,'' Scalera said in
an interview.
   After the chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co., Japan's
huge telephone utility, resigned on Dec. 14 because of links to the
scandal, the country's four biggest business organizations said the
Recruit affair was causing ``distrust of the corporate world'' and
could ``damage the free enterprise system.''
   The business organizations urged their members to ``take this
problem seriously as a matter of corporate morality.''
   But on the political level, the Liberal Democrats control all the
levers of change. The opposition parties are doubly hobbled because
they lack power in the Diet and have figures who profited from
Recruit-Cosmos shares.

   Airlines would be required to replace rivets on
hundreds of older Boeing 727s built with an outmoded adhesive under
rules expected to be proposed next month by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   Dave Duff, spokesman for the FAA's Northwest regional office,
said Wednesday that the proposal had been in the works long before
Monday's emergency landing of an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 that
suffered a 14-inch tear in its upper rear fuselage.
   The rule could affect 813 of the tri-engine jets, including about
620 flown by U.S. carriers. Those planes were built using an
adhesive that bonded at room temperature to join fuselage panels
where the panels were riveted together. After 1971, Boeing began
using adhesives that cured under heat, which produced a better bond.
   Airline industry officials said that while they wanted to see the
proposal before commenting in detail, it would be expensive to
modify the older planes. Duff said it had not yet been determined
how many of the older 727s would be covered by the proposal, the
extent of work each would need, or how much the work would cost.
   Stephen Hayes, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, a
commercial aviation trade organization, also said he had no idea of
the possible cost.
   ``It would be a substantial expense, both in terms of doing the
work and the indirect cost of taking the aircraft out of service,''
he said.
   ``Obviously, we'll work closely with the FAA and do what we have
to do to keep all of the fleet in extremely safe condition,'' Hayes
said.
   Duff said the proposal is similar to a proposed rule issued in
October to require operators of older Boeing 737s also made with the
cold-bonding process to replace more than 7,000 rivets in each of
those jets.
   That measure has not yet been made final, although a public
comment period ended Dec. 12. It was drawn up after a 20-foot roof
section blew out of a heavily used Aloha Airlines 737 flying above
Hawaii last April, killing a flight attendant and injuring 61 other
people.
   As with the earlier proposal, extensive inspection of the 727s
would be required. Duff said details were still being worked out,
including the length of the public comment period before the rule
would become final.
   The October proposal marked a turning point in FAA policy, since
it required carriers to correct potential problems in aircraft,
rather than simply inspecting for problems and fixing any trouble
found.
   At the time of the October notice, the FAA said it was studying
whether to extend the rule to 727s and to Boeing 747 jumbo jets.
Duff said Wednesday that no decision had been made on whether to
include 747s.
   On Monday, a 22-year-old Eastern Airlines 727 made an unscheduled
landing in Charleston, W.Va., after a rupture depressurized the
cabin. The cause of the blowout is under investigation.
   Darrell Pederson, assistant manager for the Seattle FAA office,
which is in charge of commercial aircraft certification, said the
agency would take another look at the proposed 727 rule in light of
that incident.
   ``If there's something new here not covered, then we will have to
take some other action,'' he said.
   At a National Transportation Safety Board inquiry into the Aloha
accident, experts said cold-bonded panels were more liable to
delamination. That placed more stress on the rivets, which had flat
heads and were countersunk into the aluminum skin and tended to
cause tiny cracks where the angle of the rivet changed.
   The new FAA proposal would replace those rivets with
``buttonhead'' types, which don't have sharp angles.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman David Jimenez said
Wednesday that the company would wait to see the new proposal before
commenting in detail. But he added: ``Whatever they decide has to be
done, we will do. Very simple.''
   Jimenez said the individual operators of the planes are
responsible for their maintenance, but that Boeing would offer
technical support for any modifications.

   Three men were arrested in Boston and Rome in an
alleged scheme to smuggle $1.4 million worth of high-tech equipment
to an Eastern bloc country, authorities said Wednesday.
   The men allegedly tried to export equipment used to test and
repair electronic chips to Bulgaria. The equipment has military and
civilian applications and export to Eastern bloc nations is
restricted.
   Franciscus B. Govaerts, 47, of Mierlo, Netherlands, and Marcel
Jules Sylvia Sanders, 33, of Belgium, who were arrested in Boston,
were charged with violating the Export Administration Act and with
money laundering, said Leonard S. Walton, a U.S. Customs Service
agent-in-charge.
   Goris Christiaan Grandia of Amsterdam was arrested by Italian
police in Rome on Dec. 23, and U.S. officials are seeking to
extradite him, U.S. Attorney Frank McNamara said.
   Authorities said Govaerts' company contacted Teradyne Inc. to buy
the equipment and was told that the United States likely would deny
export permission. A Teradyne employee informed customs and the
company allowed agents to monitor negotiations to buy the equipment.
   An undercover customs agent was introduced to Govaerts as a
Teradyne employee, and in recorded conversations Govaerts stated
that his partner, Grandia, had made contacts for the equipment in
Bulgaria, authorities said.
   It was unknown if the case is related to an arrest in Miami last
week of a man who authorities said was part of a high-tech smuggling
ring that was trying to sneak a $1.1 million VAX computer into
Bulgaria.
