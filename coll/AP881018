<HEAD>Queen in Spain On First Visit Ever By British Monarch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth paid homage to Spanish war
dead, addressed parliament and accepted the keys to the capital
Tuesday during a busy second day of her visit to Spain, the first
ever by a reigning British monarch.
   The queen, in Spain on a five-day visit, told a joint session of
parliament that Britain and Spain would play important roles in the
future development of Europe. She praised Spain for 10 years of
democracy following nearly four decades under the authoritarian
regime of Gen. Francisco Franco.
   In her speech, which received a standing ovation, Elizabeth did
not mention the British colony of Gibraltar, the only major
political dispute between the two countries.
   On Monday night, both the British monarch and her third cousin
and Spanish host, King Juan Carlos, said they believed the two
countries would eventually resolve their differences over the
colony that guards the Atlantic entrance to the Mediterranean Sea.
   Spain seeks sovereignty over Gibraltar, which it ceded to
Britain by treaty in 1713 after losing the War of Spanish
Succession. Britain has said Gibraltar will remain British unless
its 30,000 inhabitants decide otherwise.
   Earlier Tuesday a small but enthusiastic crowd waving British
and Spanish flags applauded as the queen and her husband, the Duke
of Edinburgh, placed a laurel wreath at a memorial to ``those who
gave their lives for Spain.''
   Elizabeth then went to City Hall to accept the keys to Madrid
from Mayor Juan Barranco.
   The visit brought normally heavy traffic in Madrid to a
standstill as police blocked off streets along the motorcade's
route.
   The queen's visit is to include trips to Barcelona, Seville and
El Escorial, a palace built in the foothills of the Guadarrama
Mountains north of Madrid by King Phillip II.
   The royal couple were also to spend two days on a private visit
with Juan Carlos and Sofia on the Mediterranean island of Majorca.

   An undercover policeman was shot and killed
during a drug buy and a patrolman was slain while responding to a
medical emergency in separate incidents Tuesday night, police said.
   The undercover officer was shot in the head and chest at 7:11
p.m. as he and another undercover officer tried to buy a gram of
cocaine at an apartment just west of Central Park in Manhattan,
police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said.
   In a gunfight that followed, a drug suspect was killed, Ward
told a news conference. A second suspect was arrested as he fled
the building and a third eluded police.
   The second officer was shot in the chest and stomach at 9:45
p.m. as he and his partner were getting out of their patrol car in
Harlem while responding to a medical emergency, said Officer
Virginia Conde, a police spokeswoman.
   Both of the officers died at hospitals, said Sgt. Raymond
O'Donnell, a police spokesman. The dead policemen's identities were
not released.
   In the first shooting, two men escorted the officers to the
apartment to buy drugs from a third man, and one of the three
accused the officers of being undercover police, Ward said.
   One of the three pulled out a .357-caliber handgun and shot the
officer. After the gunfight that ensued, the other officer ran into
the street and alerted backup police.
   The officer slain in the drug case was 26 years old and had been
a member of the force since 1984, Ward said.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who accompanied Ward at the news
conference, called the shooting ``an enormous tragedy. The partner
(is) terribly shaken. It's really overwhelming.''
   The officers had been attempting to carry out a buy-and-bust
raid, in which police purchase drugs from suspects, then arrest
them.

<HEAD>APME President Urges Editors: Fight Campaign Attempts To Manage
News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers must fight attempts by presidential
campaigns to orchestrate the news in hopes of getting good
television coverage, says the president of the Associated Press
Managing Editors association.
   ``The most important journalism in this campaign is being
delivered by the reporters who are going in after the candidates
have been there and are talking to voters about impressions of the
candidates and about the real problems of their regions,'' Robert
H. Giles, vice president and executive editor of The Detroit News,
told the APME on Tuesday, the first day of its annual convention.
   He told the newspaper editors: `My premise is that newspaper
editors are allowing television news directors and the campaign
strategists for George Bush and Michael Dukakis to influence their
Page 1 agendas.''
   ``As a result,'' he added, ``we are the targets of criticism
about biased or frivolous coverage that is more appropriately the
fault of television.''
   Giles suggested newspapers rely on wire services for much of the
day-to-day campaign coverage, and concentrate on providing readers
with ``issues stories.''
   On the wide perception that the current campaign has been
especially negative, Walter R. Mears, AP vice president and
executive editor, said contests in the 1960s, such as the
Goldwater-Johnson race in 1964, were no less strident or less
shaped by image-makers.
   ``We, meaning the people who report the campaign, have been
telling the voters this is a campaign of sound bites, crafted by
handlers and interpreted by spin-control specialists,'' he said.
``Those buzzwords make it sound as though these were all 1988
creations. I don't think there's anything unique about it.''
   More than 600 editors from around the country are attending the
week-long annual convention. The AP, the largest newsgathering
organization in the world, serves 1,467 daily newspapers.
   In his address to the editors, AP President and General Manager
Louis D. Boccardi said the wire service is in the midst of its most
extensive modernization in its photography, financial and technical
delivery services.
   ``As our periodic announcements may have suggested to you, we
are in the midst of the most thorough and concentrated rebuilding
and modernizing of AP services that has been attempted in modern
times,'' Boccardi said.
   Editors also heard presentations from AP editors on developments
in news and photography distribution, and discussions of changes in
the Soviet Union and its press.
   Stanislav Menshikov, a Soviet economist who collaborated with
Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith on a book about the United
States and the Soviet Union, told the editors that economic change
is meeting some resistance from the Soviet bureaucracy.
   ``They still control most of the economy and make economic
change a fiction and not a fact,'' Menshikov said.
   Galbraith said U.S. fears of communism and Soviet fears of
capitalism have abated in recent years. ``We live in a time when
both of those fears have evaporated, except on the paranoiac
right,'' he said.
   At a session on the Soviet press, Alexander Shalnev, New York
correspondent for Izvestia, said Soviet newspapers reacted to
greater press freedom with more negative stories about their
country and more positive ones on America.
   He cited an ``upsurge in the inclination to write as many
negative things as we could find out'' and said the boundaries on
what is acceptable still are being defined.
   At a panel discussion on New England, David Nyhan, political
columnist for The Boston Globe, advised the visiting editors to
``watch where you walk and how you drive.''
   ``Driving is the most dangerous thing you can do in
Massachusetts, even more than taking advice from Harvard,'' he said.
   Judson Hale, editor of Yankee magazine, said New England's
greatest export is its conscience. ``The New England conscience
never kept anyone from doing anything, but it does keep you from
enjoying it,'' he said.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis lashed at front-running George Bush as
a man with ``no convictions, no ideas and no plans'' Tuesday and
blamed Republican policies for last year's stock market plunge.
Bush tried to contain supporters' enthusiasm over polls showing him
building a large lead.
   ``We're not going to lighten up,'' the Republican presidential
nominee said while campaigning in Missouri. ``No votes can be taken
for granted and I'm not taking any votes for granted. I will
continue to campaign as an underdog.''
   There was no question who was the real underdog _ Dukakis. But
he drew enthusiastic crowds as he campaigned through Michigan with
aides battling the growing perception that Bush had taken an
insurmountable lead with just three weeks until the election.
   Dukakis' running mate Lloyd Bentsen delivered a strongly worded
response to the Republicans, accusing Bush of running ``one of the
most outrageous displays of negative campaigning ever seen in the
history of national politics.''
   The Massachusetts governor sharpened his language as he focused
on economic issues and portrayed Bush as the candidate of the
wealthy.
   ``George Bush cares about he people on Easy Street,'' Dukakis
said. ``I care about the people on Main Street. He's on their side.
I'm on your side.''
   ``Duke, Duke, Duke,'' chanted the crowds.
   Dukakis also brought up the huge stock-market drop that occurred
one year ago Wednesday.
   ``The trade deficit had soared,'' he said. ``Republican policies
of borrow and spend and borrow and spend had done the damage.''
   He pledged to eliminate the $150 billion trade deficit in four
years by reducing the budget deficit, increasing foreign trade,
investing in education and putting more emphasis on research. He
said Bush wouldn't talk about his plans.
   ``He's got the flags and balloons, but no convictions, no ideas
and no plans,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democrat's aides disputed an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll
showing Bush with a 17-point lead, his largest of the campaign.
They pointed instead to other polls indicating about half that
margin.
   Bush, trying to avoid overconfidence, campaigned in Fulton, Mo.,
and invoked the memory of Winston Churchill at the Westminster
College where Churchill delivered his 1946 ``iron curtain'' speech
warning of Soviet expansionism in Eastern Europe.
   Bush said the demarcation between East and West is now ``a
rusting curtain.'' He said that if elected he would be wary of
Soviet intentions, despite what he called more enlightened
leadership under Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``Now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the
Soviet Union.'' Bush said.
   The Bush campaign began airing tough new television commercials
that ridicule Dukakis and say he has ``opposed virtually every
defense system we developed.''
   The ad uses videotape of the helmeted Dukakis in the turret of
an M-1 tank, a ride the Democrat took in September in an attempt to
show toughness on defense issues _ but which critics said made him
look silly.
   Dukakis spokeswoman Lorraine Voles called the ad ``more
distortions from the Bush campaign.''
   The Dukakis campaign dispatched dozens of workers from his
national headquarters in Boston into the field, along with more
than 1,300 new volunteers from Washington. The campaign said 60
percent of the headquarters staff was being assigned to campaign
duties in target states.
   Among the other volunteers are students, congressional aides and
Washington attorneys taking leaves for the final three weeks of the
campaign.
   The Washington Post reported Wednesday without attribution that
in addition the Dukakis campaign has requested time from ABC, CBS
and NBC for five 30-minute programs and hopes to air the shows at
the same time on each network. The newspaper said the plan would
cost about $5 million.
   Public polls ranged from bad to worse for Dukakis, though his
aides pointed to what they said was a new Harris poll putting the
gap at 9 points. Barbara Winokur, a spokeswoman for Louis Harris &
Associates, said Harris would release a poll Wednesday but declined
to comment on its results in advance.
   Two other surveys found Bush leads of about that size. One, of
1,002 registered voters polled Saturday through Monday, put the
race at 49-39; another, of 1,201 likely voters Friday through
Monday, put it at 49-40.
   Both were ongoing tracking polls _ in which the newest day's
result is added to several days being covered and the oldest day's
is dropped _ done by KRC@Communications Research in Cambridge,
Mass. They had three-point error margins.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle traveled by
bus caravan through small Illinois towns, accompanied by Gov. James
Thompson. Quayle said he felt ``a special obligation ... to help
George Bush define the needs of a new generation of Americans,
their challenges, their responses.''
   ``With George Bush you get experience,'' the 41-year-old Quayle
said. ``With me you get the future, the future of America.''
   Bentsen, in Los Angeles, denounced Bush's campaign attacks on
Dukakis as ``an utterly vicious onslaught of distortion and
character assassination.'' He said the Democrats have ``been a
little too flabbergasted sometimes to make a proper response.''
   ``They don't seem to mind if what they say is untrue,'' he said.
``They don't seem to worry if it's misleading. They don't seem to
care that what they do is downright mean. If it sounds good, say
it. If it sells, package it. If it looks good, nominate it.''
   Democrat Jesse Jackson discounted suggestions he has not worked
hard enough for Dukakis, his former rival for the Democratic
nominamtion.
   ``No Democrat since Atlanta has traveled more miles, spoken to
more people and registered more Democrats for the ticket than I
have,'' the Democratic runnerup said in a telephone interview from
his Chicago home.

   Insects believed to be African
locusts have been discovered in Grenada and are a threat to the
island's agriculture, an agricultural official says.
   ``We are now making an intensive investigation as to the extent
of the infestation,'' said a spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry
on Tuesday. ``We cannot say anymore now but, if what we fear is
true, there is a serious threat to the agricultural industry.''
   The first sighting was made on Thursday. Since then there have
been several reports of sightings of the insects on the island's
east coast, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A specimen of the insect at the Pest Control office of the
Department of Agriculture is about three inches long.
   The spokesman said it is not known how the insects came to
Grenada, though he said they are believed to have been ``blown
across from Africa.''
   They have also been sighted on the neighboring island of
Carriacou.
   Agricultural officials in Dominica are studying the insects to
determine their origin. The locusts appeared in large numbers on
the island following heavy rains last week.
   The locusts have been seen flying around Dominica but so far no
swarm has been seen.
   There are unconfirmed reports of sightings also in St. Vincent,
Trinidad, Barbados, St. Lucia and Antigua.

   A gunman robbed a bank Tuesday, kidnapped
the bank manager and drove off in the manager's car, only to be
cornered by a police roadblock on an interstate, authorities said.
   The manager, Al Jacobson, 61, was freed about seven hours after
police closed Interstate 176, a spur from Interstate 76 leading to
Reading, said Terrell Weaver, a police communications operator.
   Negotiations with the gunmman continued late Tuesday, Mrs.
Weaver said.
   A state police SWAT team and an FBI tactical team arrived at the
scene six hours after the standoff began about 10 miles south of
this southeast Pennsylvania city, said a Berks County dispatch
supervisor who declined to give her name.
   A nearby access road was closed because traffic seemed to
startle the gunman, the supervisor said.
   The suspect's brother was brought to the scene in an effort to
persuade him to surrender, but the robber asked his brother to
leave, said the supervisor.
   Police asked the suspect to exchange the bank manager for an
officer, but he turned the offer down, authorities said.
   The man was armed with a 9mm pistol, said Amity Township Police
Chief Maurice Eschbach, who questioned several witnesses to the
robbery.
   The robber, identified by police only as a 29-year-old from the
Pottstown area, took the manager hostage at 4 p.m. at the Meridian
Bank in Amity Township, according to an FBI agent who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Police believe less than $5,000 was taken, said the Berks County
supervisor.

   Steven Levy's book is about a hippie-like New
Age guru who allegedly killed his girlfriend and stuffed her in a
trunk. Teresa Carpenter's book is about a professor who battered
his prostitute-mistress.
   When this husband and wife dine at night, does mayhem mingle
with the meatloaf? Not necessarily, they say.
   ``It would be wrong to suggest (our conversations) were
excessively morbid. They don't tend to be morose,'' says Levy.
   But Carpenter quickly adds, ``We could swap forensic stories and
I could tell him who he should talk to in the FBI.''
   For three years, Levy, 37, and Carpenter, 40, worked separately
but simultaneously on these two accounts of similarly repulsive
crimes.
   The experience of both writing at the same time turned out quite
well, Carpenter said during a recent interview at the couple's
Fifth Avenue apartment, a well-lighted, book-filled home.
   In his book _ ``The Unicorn's Secret: Murder in the Age of
Aquarius,'' to be published this month by Prentice Hall Press _
Levy examined the bizarre case of Ira Einhorn, Philadelphia's
enigmatic peace-and-love freak and parapsychology crusader who was
charged in 1979 with killing his girlfriend, Holly Maddux. Eighteen
months after Maddux was last seen alive, her decomposed, mummified
body was found in a locked trunk in their apartment.
   Einhorn, known about town as ``The Unicorn,'' shrugged off the
allegations and accused the CIA and others of planting evidence in
his home, but he skipped bail before trial. He remains a fugitive,
likely living in Europe.
   Carpenter's book, ``Missing Beauty,'' published in June by W.W.
Norton, is the story of what led Tufts University medical
researcher William Douglas in 1983 to smash the skull of Robin
Benedict, the high-priced Boston prostitute with whom he'd fallen
insanely in love.
   Even though the essentials of the stories are similar _ both
victims were women trying to extract themselves from relationships
with obsessively possessive men _ the two men could not be more
unalike.
   The Unicorn was a brilliant and charismatic bear of a figure, a
ladies' man extraordinaire and counterculture oddball given to such
benign weirdness as answering his door stark naked. Though he
dressed in a dashiki and dirty jeans, sported a full beard and
shoulder-length hair and frequently smelled bad, Einhorn
established an incredible global network of scientists, corporate
sponsors and wealthy benefactors.
   ``Ira was the epitome of the guy who worked in fringe circles,
was antiestablishment and still looked like a hippie when he was
almost 40,'' says Levy. ``Douglas was this traditional, respected
man.''
   Superficially, Douglas did appear to lead a normal life: He was
a solidly middle-class family man with three children, an eminent
medical school professor and acknowledged expert in cell culture.
   ``Everything about him was so normal, so stultifyingly normal.
... He was a man who one would never imagine could have gotten
himself into a situation like this,'' Carpenter said.
   But then there was that other side, sufficiently dark, private
and perverse to fascinate the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for
four years. Carpenter received the award in 1981 for her crime
coverage for The Village Voice.
   Here was ``a scientist who had been embezzling research funds to
support a mistress _ who happened to be a hooker. He was living a
double life ... That's what hooked me,'' she said.
   Researching her book, Carpenter spent weeks walking the streets
and hanging out in the bars and strip joints of the Combat Zone,
the netherworld that is Boston's red-light district, talking to
bartenders, pimps, whores and strippers who knew Douglas' young
victim.
   ``That was very difficult for me. I'm not a street person and
never dared pose as one,'' she said.
   While Carpenter was exploring the gamy depths, Levy was having
anxieties of his own as he waited for her nightly call from Boston,
assuring him that she was safe.
   ``I wasn't happy about it, but this is what Teresa does. It's
important for her to do the story right,'' Levy said.
   ``Missing Beauty'' is Carpenter's first book, but she was
already a respected master of crime stories: She had reported on
the killings of Playmate Dorothy Stratton and politician Allard
Lowenstein.
   ``The Unicorn's Secret'' is Levy's first major excursion into
the genre; his other book, ``Hackers,'' is about the personal
computer revolution. Levy is a free-lance writer and contributing
editor for Rolling Stone.
   So, what is the allure of the macabre?
   Says Levy: ``When something happens it gives you a window into
the way people live, the way people are. ... It's like an
archaeological dig. Like if someone unearths a civilization frozen
by a volcano or something. That's what a murder does _ it freezes
details of our lives.''

<HEAD>Portugal To Sink Grounded Ship and 5,400 Cars in Atlantic</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Portugal will send a new but wrecked
ship and its cargo of 5,400 Japanese cars to the bottom of the
Atlantic, whatever the outrage of ecologists, because ``no
practical alternative is available.''
   That was the comment of Adm. Silva Horta, chairman of the
Portuguese National Council against Marine Pollution, after
returning last week from London, where he reported on the case to
the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping.
   The 58,000-ton Reijin ran aground April 27 in shallow water off
the northern city of Oporto, the first stop on its maiden voyage
from Japan to Ireland. One sailor was killed.
   Emerald Shipholding SA, a Japanese-owned Panamanian company to
which the ship belongs, said July 13 the Reijin was not recoverable
and assumed responsibility for the wreck's removal. The new cars
must be scuttled because they could be unsafe to drive.
   Horta said the company insisted on sinking the ship and its
$100-million cargo at sea and threatened to abandon the wreck if
Portugal refused to cooperate. That would leave the Portuguese with
disposal project costing millions of dollars.
   Environmentalists in Portugal and elsewhere say the 173 tons of
copper and lead, 115 tons of paint, 28 tons of oil and more than
1,000 tons of rubber, plastic and textiles could seriously damage
marine life.
   Salvage workers are dismantling the Reijin's top decks and
ferrying the scrap metal and some cars ashore. The rest of the ship
will be refloated, towed out and sunk in at least 6,000 feet of
water, Horta said in an interview.
   Cars now being unloaded will be dumped 40 miles off the coast,
and the wreck, with the remaining cargo, will be scuttled 150 miles
out by mid-November, the admiral said.
   The Robin Wood Association, an ecology group based in Paris, has
called the decision ``an ecological crime'' and further criticism
has come from the Oslo Convention, which monitors sea pollution.
   Portuguese environmentalists want action from the European
Economic Community, of which Portugal has been a member since Jan.
1, 1986.
   ``It is indeed a crime, dangerous to the whole world, not just
to Portugal,'' Mike Weber, a German lecturer at Oporto's Institute
for Biomedical Science, said in a telephone interview. ``Any
ecology schoolbook will tell you that one liter of oil pollutes one
million liters of water.''
   Marine authorities feel they have no choice.
   If the government tried to salvage the wreck, it not only would
have to pay the estimated cost of $15 million but might also face
claims from Japanese automakers contending that their images were
tarnished by the sale of potentially unsafe cars to bargain-hunters.
   ``We could not take over the task of removing the ship ourselves
because we did not have the technical, financial or even legal
means to do so before the autumn bad weather,'' Horta said.
   Coast guard officials say the first storm of the winter season
probably would destroy the grounded vessel and spread the wreckage
in Portuguese coastal waters. So, the admiral said, ``we consider
the plan to dump at sea the lesser evil.''
   Removal of another ship _ the Tollan, grounded in the Tagus
estuary off Lisbon in 1980 _ cost the government more than $1.4
million and officials want to avoid a far larger bill for the
Reijin.
   Owners are required by Portuguese law to remove wrecks declared
to be dangerous, but Horta said: ``It is, unfortunately, well-known
that this obligation very often cannot be enforced.''
   Shipping companies that operate under the Panamanian flag of
convenience often have little capital other than their vessels.
Horta said the Reijin apparently was the only valuable asset of
Emerald Shipholding.
   Insurers are reluctant to talk about the case, but one based in
Lisbon, speaking privately, said he was ``mystified that such a
modern, well-equipped ship could sink in shallow waters after
making a long, tough voyage from Japan.''
   One theory is that the computerized self-leveling system
overreacted when about 200 cars were unloaded in Oporto and the
crew was unable to adjust it.

   New outbreaks of racial insults were
reported at Smith College and the University of Massachusetts as
the second anniversary neared of a post-World Series brawl at the
state school that injured 10 people.
   At Smith College in nearby Northampton, President Mary Maples
Dunn sent a memo to the school's 2,722 undergraduates last week
saying that notes with racial slurs had been slipped under a
student's door and tacked onto a bulletin board.
   A separate memo from the Office of Student Affairs said other
students had received four similar notes since mid-September. The
school said an investigation was under way.
   A University of Massachusetts administrator said he was looking
into reports of racial slurs made over walkie-talkies two weeks
ago, on a frequency reserved for foremen and supervisors of the
Physical Plant Department on the Amherst campus of 26,650 students.
   ``I've been working as dispatcher here 13 years and I've never
heard anything like that,'' said Dennis Hmieleski, the radio
dispatcher on duty at the time. ``You hear people joking around
sometimes and you take it for that, but it was the tone of the
voice. You could tell it was no joke.''
   Hmieleski said he wasn't certain who made the remarks. He said
he and other workers reported them to their department's director,
who said he expects to make his findings public later this week.
   There have been recent racial incidents at other schools in the
nation.
   Six DePauw University fraternities and sororities apologized for
a ``ghetto party'' with decorations that included graffiti slurs
against black and other minorities.
   Members of the six organizations at the Greencastle, Ind.,
campus staged a candlelight vigil Monday night and marched from the
Alpha Tau Omega house, where the party was held Friday night, to
the Association for Afro-American Students office. Members of the
two groups conferred, shook hands and embraced.
   At Stanford University, officials promised to look into two
racist incidents in recent weeks. Last Friday, a poster at the
predominantly black fraternity house Ujamaa was discovered
emblazoned with the word ``niggers.''
   Two weeks earlier a flier depicting Beethoven as brown-skinned,
with wild, curly hair, big lips and red eyes was left outside the
room of a black freshman from Chicago.
   The reports of incidents at the western Massachusetts schools
came as the University of Massachusetts prepared for a weeklong
commemoration of a fight between white Boston Red Sox fans and
black New York Mets fans after the Mets won the final game of the
World Series on Oct. 27, 1986.
   Soon after the fight, racial epithets were found spray-painted
on steps at Smith. A year later, two black administrators and the
first black woman to earn tenure at Smith resigned from their
posts, saying the school had shut minorities out of decision making.
   Another fight between blacks and whites at the University of
Massachusetts last February sparked a six-day building takeover by
more than 100 minority students protesting racial violence and what
they said was a low minority enrollment. At least 8 percent of
undergraduates at the school last year were minorities.
   The six students accused of fighting last winter are scheduled
to appear in Hampshire District Court in Northampton for a hearing
Oct. 27.
   To mark the anniversary, the university plans a week of
racism-awareness events beginning Friday. They include ``Hands
Across UMass,'' a chain of students linking hands around the
campus, and a lecture by civil rights activist and Atlanta Mayor
Andrew Young.
   Smith unveiled its plan to combat racism in a report released
last week that, among other things, calls for a 20 percent minority
faculty by mid-1999 and gives the college until 1995 to admit a
first-year class with the same percentage of minority students as
the population of high school graduates.
   Smith spokeswoman Debra Bradley said 19 percent of this year's
freshman class and 13.5 percent of the total student population are
minorities.
   A committee of Smith faculty, trustees, administrators and
students came up with the plan after 200 students marched on the
president's house in April with a list of grievances, including
demands to be included in the hiring of an affirmative action
officer.
   ``It's a good plan, especially when one considers it's coming in
to fill a complete vacuum,'' said Wambui Mwangi, president of the
Smith African Student Association.

<BYLINE>WASHINGTON TODAY: ``Sorry, Senator. Your Amendment Was Sent to
Purgatory.''
^By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Is the amendment in purgatory? Only the
category will tell.
   The Senate, struggling to deal with hundreds of amendments to a
bill providing new ammunition for the war on drugs, hammered
together a system designed to speed its work and permit Congress to
adjourn for the year.
   At times it appeared that the labor-and-time-saving device might
prove a tottering house of cards that would bring all progress to a
halt.
   It worked this way:
   The amendments were assigned to categories.
   With some, the skids were greased.
   With others, the road ahead was rocky indeed.
   Still others faced a fate uncertain.
   Category 1 amendments were offered as a package containing
scores of legislative initiatives and eventually all were approved
on a single bloc vote.
   Category 2 amendments might stand a chance, but only if they
were approved by a panel of senators from both parties. Decisions
could be appealed to the Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders.
   ``Those are the purgatory amendments,'' said Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``They do not know where they are going.
And they may not be going anywhere.''
   Category 3 amendments could be offered individually and face
their chances.
   Category 4 amendments did not make the cut and had no chance at
all.
   It took unanimous consent of all 100 senators for the gears to
mesh and the system to move forward.
   The spur to getting that consent was the desire of many senators
facing re-election contests to leave the capital and get on with
campaigning.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, had a complaint.
   ``I had an amendment and I find it is not even on the purgatory
list,'' he said.
   ``That raises the question to me whether my amendment went to
heaven or hell,'' he said.
   ``How do I find that out?''
   ``It went to hell,'' replied Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Stevens: ``I know the senator from Texas might want me to go
there, but where did my amendment go?
   Dole: ``It is on list No. 4.
   ``What happens to list No. 4? Stevens asked.
   ``Nothing,'' Dole replied.

   Bean soup, that enduring congressional culinary tradition, has
been on the menu of the United States Senate Restaurant for most of
the days of this century, every day for the last 85 years at least.
   But being on the menu does not necessarily mean being on the
stove or on the table.
   And one day 45 years ago, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
recalled, the bean soup pots stopped bubbling for the first time
ever.
   ``Even though bean soup was on the menu that day at 10 cents a
cup, 15 cents a bowl, it wasn't cooking on the stove,'' Dole said.
   The day was Sept. 14, 1943, and the Senate was beanless and
therefore soupless.
   ``This was because war-time rationing had slashed the Senate's
supply of white Michigan beans,'' Dole explained.
   ``Somehow, by the next day, more beans were found and bowls of
bean soup have been ladled up without any interruption ever
since,'' he said.
   Bean soup is on the menu in the Senate because it was ordered to
be there.
   There is some question as to who gave the orders.
   Some attribute the decree to Sen. Fred Thomas DuBois of Idaho.
Bean soup was his favorite and he presided over the Senate Rules
Committee which in turn presided over the Senate restaurant.
Therefore, bean soup went on the menu.
   Others say the demand was made in 1903 by Sen. Knute Nelson of
Minnesota.
   The rage for bean soup soon spread to the House and in 1904
Speaker Joe Cannon, an Illinois Republican, was outraged that the
menu of the House restaurant did not list it.
   For years Cannon's words on the subject were also printed on the
House menu, along with a recipe for the now famous soup:
``Thunderation, I had my mouth set for bean soup. From now on, hot
or cold, rain, snow or shine, I want it on the menu every day.''
   There are many differences in the operating styles of the House
and Senate and Dole said that the preparation of bean soup is one
of them.
   The Senate recipe calls for adding onions braised in butter.
   The House recipe calls for beans, beans, beans _ nothing but
beans.

   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and King Juan
Carlos of Spain toasted a new era of good relations, saying they
looked forward to bridging their countries' major point of
contention _ the Rock of Gibraltar.
   The Queen, on the first-ever visit of a reigning British monarch
to Spain, only alluded to the British colony at the southern tip of
the Iberian Peninsula.
   ``We are confident that our growing mutual understanding will
enable us to deal with the one remaining problem which exists
between us,'' she told the Spanish king Monday at a state dinner.
   Gibraltar was ceded to Britain in 1713 when Spain lost the War
of Spanish Succession.
   In November 1984 both governments agreed to discuss the future
of the fortress, including sovereignty, at ministerial-level
meetings.
   Juan Carlos, who is Elizabeth's third cousin, said, ``This route
of dialogue and cooperaton between both our countries will
eventually lead to a concrete end.''

   President Reagan's son Ron says he hopes his
parents will lie around a pool and relax once the new man takes
over the White House.
   The younger Reagan, 30, said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
television interview broadcast Monday that he expects his parents
will write their memoirs.
   Ron Reagan, who works for ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,''
taped his BBC interview in the United States.
   Reagan said he expects ``things will be a little more relaxed''
for him when his parents return to private life and that he expects
his parents will follow their eight years in Washington ``with a
lot of laying around the pool, getting a tan.''

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor has
re-entered St. John's Hospital for X-rays to determine the progress
of therapy on her back, her spokeswoman said.
   ``The X-rays are to see what improvement there has been with her
physical therapy,'' spokeswoman Chen Sam said by telephone Monday
from New York.
   In July, Miss Taylor, 56, was admitted to St. John's for a
compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra that produced
lower back muscle spasms. She hurt herself in June when she fell on
the set of the film ``Young Toscannini'' in Rome, said Ms. Sam.
   During that stay, she underwent physical therapy and had X-rays
taken. She went back to the hospital in late September for more
X-rays, she said.
   Miss Taylor has suffered back problems since she fell of a horse
and fractured her spine 30 years ago, Ms. Sam said.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo's son, Andrew, says
he believes in his ``heart and soul'' that he made the right choice
by leaving his partnership in a law firm to work full time on
creating housing for the homeless.
   Cuomo, 30, announced his decision Monday. He reportedly earned
more than $225,000 annually at the firm of Blutrich, Falcone and
Miller, which he joined three years ago as a partner.
   His salary as head of HELP, a not-for-profit organization, will
be between $50,000 and $60,000 annually, said Jeffrey Sachs,
director of operations for the group.
   Cuomo founded HELP three years ago to provide transitional
housing for women with children as an alternative to welfare hotels.
   He said his resignation was effective immediately.
   ``I believe in my heart and soul this is the right thing to
do,'' Cuomo said. ``I don't want to do this forever, but for now,
there's nothing I'd rather do.''

   Comedian Jerry Lewis plans to play a haberdasher
caught in a crime scandal in CBS-TV's ``Wiseguy'' this season, an
executive producer said.
   Producer Stephen J. Cannell also said Monday that the first
villain of the season, a charismatic leader of a white supremacist
sect, will be played by Tennessee attorney Fred Dalton Thompson,
best known for his 1970s television appearances as real-life
minority counsel on the Watergate Committee.
   Thompson made his film debut in the 1985 movie ``Marie,''
starring Sissy Spacek. He played himself, the attorney for Marie
Ragghianti, the parole board chairwoman who blew the whistle on a
pardons-for-money scheme. Dalton was later cast as the head of the
CIA in the movie ``No Way Out.''
   Cannell said he decided to offer Lewis the guest shot after he
saw ``The King of Comedy'' again recently. In that film, Lewis had
a rare dramatic role as a famous talk-show host held hostage by an
aspiring comedian played by Robert De Niro.

   Michelle Triola Marvin, who made headlines
when she won a landmark ``palimony'' suit against former live-in
boyfriend Lee Marvin, was recuperating at her Malibu home after
suffering a heart attack.
   Ms. Marvin was released Saturday in good condition from
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was taken Oct. 7 after
suffering a heart attack, hospital spokesman Ron Wise said Monday.
   Doctors performed an angioplasty, in which a balloon is inserted
into a clogged blood vessel and inflated, widening the vessel and
restoring the blood flow, Wise said.
   ``She came through it real well,'' Wise said.
   In 1979, Ms. Marvin sued for half of the actor's fortune in a
celebrated palimony case handled by divorce attorney Marvin
Mitchelson. Her right to sue was upheld, but her claim was
ultimately rejected, though the actor was ordered to pay her a
nominal sum for rehabilitation.
   Marvin, the Oscar-winning actor of ``Cat Ballou'' died in August
1987 at age 63.

<HEAD>IRS Failing To Collect Billions In Business Taxes, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service could collect
billions of dollars more a year by using the same aggressive
enforcement tactics against businesses that it uses against
individual taxpayers, a congressional report says.
   The report by the Government Operations subcommittee on
commerce, consumer and monetary affairs comes amid a presidential
campaign in which Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis has made
more aggressive collection of unpaid taxes a cornerstone of his
economic proposals.
   The subcommittee report, released Monday, says the IRS should
develop a program to match ``information returns'' showing interest
and dividend income paid to businesses with the actual tax returns
filed by each company.
   The report estimated that between $3.2 billion and $8 billion a
year in taxes on interest and dividends earned by businesses is
never collected because the income is not reported to the IRS.
   The IRS for years has been using its computers to compare
information returns listing interest and dividend payments to
individuals with the income tax returns filed by the individuals.
The program produced $2.35 billion in additional tax revenue from
individuals in fiscal 1985.
   Banks and corporations are not required to file such information
returns, but the House report said the IRS still received 26
million such returns in 1985, showing income payments to 5 million
businesses totaling $987 billion.
   Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee, has
introduced legislation to mandate the filing of information returns
by businesses. He said the IRS hasn't even been using the corporate
returns it has been receiving without such a requirement.
   ``By casting these information returns aside, IRS is not only
missing the chance to assess many billions of dollars of unreported
business tax liabilities but has created a double standard of
enforcement that is more lenient by far toward businesses than
individuals,'' Barnard said.
   IRS spokesman Frank Keith said Monday the agency has not seen
the House report and will not comment until agency officials review
it.
   But at a hearing before Barnard's subcommittee last year, IRS
Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs said the additional tax revenue that
would be generated by a document matching program for corporations
would not justify the administrative costs.
   Gibbs said those costs would be much higher than for the
document matching program for individuals because corporations use
different fiscal years, varying accounting methods and different
names.
   The House report said the problems cited by Gibbs all ``pertain
to the way income is reported'' to the IRS.
   ``The IRS never considered the desirability of modifying the
reporting requirements, nor assessed the feasibility of a partial
document matching program encompassing those corporations to which
the difficulties do not pertain,'' the report said.
   Gibbs promised the subcommittee last year that the IRS would
begin using document matching to verify income reported on tax
returns from single-owner businesses and would start a multiyear
study to determine the extent of business under-reporting of
interest and dividend income.
   He also said the agency would begin a test program using
information returns to detect corporations and partnerships that do
not file any income tax returns.
   That test program in one district office was so successful, the
House report said, that the IRS now has expanded it to nine more
districts and could have a document matching program ready by next
spring to identify nonfilers among corporations and partnerships
nationwide.
   Despite such efforts, Barnard said the IRS still ``has not been
sufficiently diligent in attempting to extend its sophisticated
computer matching capabilities to businesses.''
   ``Individuals, and now sole proprietors, who know that each and
every one of their returns will be scrutinized by IRS computers for
unreported income deserve to know why corporate and partnership
returns are being excused from this automatic examination
process,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The government is investigating complaints
that about 100,000 pickup trucks made by General Motors Corp. may
have a tendency to go out of control because of a defective bolt
that harms the vehicles' braking system.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Monday
it had opened an investigation into unconfirmed reports of brake
problems involving 1988 Chevrolet and GMC half-ton pickup trucks.
It also undertook six other probes involving major automakers.
   One person reportedly died when a GM pickup truck's rear-brake
backing bolt broke off and fell into the brake assembly, the agency
said.
   The agency said it had received two other unconfirmed reports of
the brake problem.
   David Hudgens, a spokesman at GM's Detroit headquarters, said
the company would cooperate fully with the investigation.
   ``Just because there is an inquiry doesn't mean there is a
defect,'' he said. ``That would remain to be seen.''
   The six other investigations started by the agency in September
were in response to complaints of:
   _Anti-lock braking failure in 43,000 1985-1987 Lincoln
Continentals. The agency said it had received nine unconfirmed
complaints, including one that involved an accident.
   _Compartment fires in 1980-1988 Ford Crown Victorias equipped
with the 5.8-liter V-8 engine. The vehicles are used mainly by
police departments. The agency reported eight complaints.
   _Fires and loss of power steering caused by a power-steering
hose in 90,000 1986-model Buick LeSabres. The agency received two
complaints, one of which involved a fire.
   _Burned carpeting from overheated exhaust systems in 64,000
1987-1988 Chrysler Dodge Daytonas. The agency received four
complaints.
   _Sudden separation of the steering wheel in 40,000 1987
Volkswagen Fox vehicles. The agency received two complaints.
   _Fuel expulsion in the GM's P-30 chassis, used by other
manufacturers as a base for motor homes.
   Engineers at the traffic safety agency found no defect trend in
preliminary evaluations of four defect complaints involving major
manufacturers and closed the investigations. The complaints
involved:
   _Throttle control problems in the 1987-1988 Chrysler Jeep.
   _Halfshaft failure in the 1984-1986 Ford Tempo and Topaz.
   _Defogger fires in the 1987 Toyota Corolla.
   _Frame cracking in the 1982-1985 GM Camaro and Firebird.
   No defect trends were found in two engineering analyses, the
next highest level of investigation, involving major manufacturers.
The investigations were into complaints of rear-brake lockup on the
1981-1982 Chevette diesel car and the 1986 Ford Aerostar.
   The agency closed an engineering analysis into allegations of
defective power steering in GM's 1980-1986 A-body, J-body and
X-body cars, concluding that any defect posed no unreasonable risk
to motorists.

<HEAD>Routine Painting Leads to Discovery of Airline Cracks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A routine repainting job led to the discovery
of a foot-long crack in an aging Continental Airlines Boeing 737,
five months after the government had ordered special inspections to
look for such flaws.
   A spokesman for Continental confirmed that the large crack as
well as 29 smaller ones were discovered near a window of the
first-class section after paint was stripped from the plane in
preparation for repainting Oct. 5.
   The cracks stretched about 30 inches along a joint where
sections of metal skin overlap, according to investigators of the
National Transportation Safety Board, whose metallurgists are
examining the section.
   NTSB chairman James Kolstad called it a ``chilling discovery''
in a speech Monday to an aviation group in Montreal and said it was
``frightening'' because the cracking was found ``in the same
general area'' where an Aloha Airlines plane broke apart last April
while in flight.
   The NTSB has yet to issue a finding of the reason for the Aloha
breakup, although it has been widely speculated that corrosion and
a type of ``cold bonding'' used in older Boeing 737s played a part.
A 20-foot section of the Aloha jet tore away during flight,
sweeping a flight attendant to her death. The plane miraculously
landed safely despite the gaping hole.
   The Aloha and Continental planes both were built in 1969 using
the cold bonding method. While the Aloha plane had 89,000 takeoffs
and landings at the time of the incident, the Continental aircraft
had only 55,446 such cycles, officials said.
   The Aloha plane was No. 152 off the Boeing assembly line, while
the Continental jet was No. 17O.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials cautioned against
drawing too close a parallel between the Aloha incident and the
cracks found on the Continental jet.
   One FAA official, speaking on condition he not be further
identified, said the cracks on the Continental jet were located
lower on the aircraft, near a window, where repair work apparently
had been performed by a previous owner of the plane.
   The FAA last May issued an order that all older Boeing 737s _
those with at least 30,000 cycles _ undergo a special visual
inspection for cracking. Planes with at least 55,000 cycles had to
undergo ``eddy current'' tests using high-frequency electronic
equipment along the top of the aircraft.
   Ned Walker, a spokesman for Continental, said the aircraft in
question had been visually inspected, as required by the FAA, last
May and no cracks were found. He said the section where the
foot-long crack was discovered Oct. 5 was not subject to the more
sophisticated electronic ``eddy current'' test under the FAA
directive.
   An FAA spokesman, Bob Buckhorn, said the agency expects to issue
a new directive soon to airlines broadening the inspection
requirements, including increased use of eddy current testing. The
new rule also will require that the planes be stripped of paint
when inspected, he said.
   Walker said after the cracking was discovered Oct. 5,
Continental inspected all 42 of its older Boeing 737s within 72
hours and found no cracking problems with any of the planes.
   ``This appears to be an isolated incident,'' he said from
Continental's headquarters in Houston.
   The Boeing 737 is widely used for short-haul flights. According
to the Boeing Co., 212 older Boeing 737s operated by 19 U.S.
airlines in domestic service were subject to the special FAA
inspection requirements last May.
   A Boeing spokesman said the manufacturer was aware of the cracks
discovered by Continental, but referred all questions to the
airline.

<HEAD>Dairy Farmers To Benefit From New Government Computer System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers soon will be getting information from
a new computer system devised by the Agriculture Department to help
them select only the best cows for their milking herds _ the cream
of the crop, so to speak.
   The genetic evaluation system, called the Animal Model, takes
into account more of a cow's relatives than does the older system,
the Modified Contemporary Comparison, which has been used since
1974, the department's Agricultural Research Service said Monday.
   Under the new system, milk production of a cow's daughters will
be considered when the mother is being evaluated. And the
evaluation of bulls, based in part on the records of the male's
offspring, also take into account the impact of the bull's mate on
those offspring.
   The new system will be used for the first time in dairy genetic
evaluations to be prepared in July 1989, the report said. The
information then will be reported to dairy farmers who can use it
to decide which cows and their calves to keep in the herd.
   ``With this information in hand, the farmer can select with more
accuracy the calves likely to be the most efficient milk
producers,'' the report said.
   The new system, a revision of the older method, was developed by
George R. Wiggans, a research geneticist at the agency's facility
in Beltsville, Md. The older method was developed by Duane Norman,
also of Beltsville.
   Agency work in genetic evaluation for many years has been an
important part of a nationwide effort to improve the U.S. dairy
herd. Milk output rose from 7,029 pounds per cow in 1960 to 13,293
pounds in 1986, the report said.
   The trend has continued, with USDA figures showing the average
milk production last year rose further to an average of 13,932
pounds.
   ``Approximately 60,000 farmers participate in the improvement
program, which involves recording milk production of each cow for
one day every month,'' the report said. ``Information on each
animal is compiled and sent to the Animal Improvement Programs
Laboratory at Beltsville, home to approximately 39 million milk
production records on 15 million cows.''
   The participating dairy farmers then receive reports on each of
their animals, the report said.
   Wiggans began working on the new system two years ago and in May
1987 transferred the programs to computers at the Cornell National
Supercomputer Facility, Ithaca, N.Y.
   The Cornell supercomputer has a very large memory, which was
necessary to handle all the additional details of the evaluations,
including all the relatives of milk cows, he said.

   The financial worth of burley tobacco
producers is far below the national average for other farmers, but
they also have fewer debts, an Agriculture Department study says.
   The study by the department's Economic Research Service involved
273 burley tobacco farms surveyed by questionnaire in Kentucky and
Tennessee for the 1984 crop, the most recent information available.
   It said the net worth of burley tobacco producers averaged
$130,715, substantially below the $322,732 average for all U.S.
farm producers. The average farm debt for burley farms was about a
third less than the average for all U.S. farm producers.
   According to the report, which was distributed here on Monday,
the farms produced an average of 2.3 acres of burley, a cigarette
tobacco. The crop is labor intensive and required an average of 240
hours of family and hired labor per acre, or 13 hours per 100
pounds of leaf produced in 1984. An additional 11 hours of custom
labor was used on each acre.
   The 2.3 acres of burley tobacco was grown on farms averaging a
total of 122 acres of farmland.
   ``Most farms relied on non-farm sources to supplement their
income,'' the report said. ``Small tobacco farms with less than 2.1
acres of burley generally averaged equal sales from crops and
livestock. Large tobacco farms with 6 or more acres of burley
tobacco depended less on livestock sales, receiving more than 70
percent of their gross cash farm income from crop sales.''

   A new labeling law in Portugal may restrict
that country's imports of soybean oil in favor of other kinds of
vegetable oil, according to an Agriculture Department trade report.
   The law requires that some labels for edible vegetable oil
containers indicated ``oil for dressing and frying,'' while other
labels indicate ``oil for dressing'' only, says the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service.
   Basis for the labeling is whether the vegetable oil contains 2
percent or less of linolenic acid, which would qualify as ``oil for
dressing and frying.'' If the acid content is more than that, it
would be restricted to dressings.
   Sunflowerseed oil, which is produced widely in the European
Economic Community, has the lower acid content and would qualify as
a dual-purpose oil. Portugal is a member of the EEC. However,
soybean oil, mostly from outside the EEC _ including the United
States _ has 7 percent linolenic acid and would be restricted to
dressings, the report said.

   ``The Accused,'' an emotionally shattering tale
starring Jodie Foster as a gang rape victim, earned $4.3 million
last weekend to take the No. 1 spot in the weekly box office
listings.
   The film, which co-stars Kelly McGillis as a reluctant
prosecutor and is loosely based on a 1983 mass assault on a woman
at a bar in New Bedford, Mass., averaged $5,442 per screen in its
limited release to 796 theaters.
   ``Alien Nation,'' a police thriller that pairs cop James Caanaan
with a crime-fighting extraterrestrial, dropped to second place
with $4.25 million, followed by the Tom Hanks-Sally Field film
about standup comics, ``Punchline,'' which garnered $3.54 million.
   The fourth spot at $2.6 million went to ``Gorillas in the
Mist,'' starring Sigourney Weaver as zoologist Dian Fossey trying
to save the endangered primates.
   Director Joan Micklin Silver's ``Crossing Delancey,'' about
up-scale New Yorker Amy Irving's matchmaker-arranged romance with a
pickle merchant, placed fifth with nearly $1.2 million, followed by
the offbeat John Cleese-Kevin Kline-Jamie Lee Curtis comedy ``A
Fish Called Wanda,'' with $1.16 million.
   Bruce Willis' action bloodbath ``Die Hard'' was in seventh place
with $1.06 million, followed by Disney's ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit'' with $1.04 million in eighth, and actor Tom Cruise's

<HEAD>US Aid to Egypt, Pakistan Criticized as Hurting Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some U.S. aid to Egyptian and Pakistani
government agencies undercuts the Reagan administration policy of
helping private business and discouraging government-owned
enterprise, congressional investigators have concluded.
   A report by the General Accounting Office, which monitors
government spending for Congress, cited as an example the fact that
the Agency for International Development had encouraged Pakistan to
end agricultural subsidies but also had financed $142 million in
fertilizer and $123 million in wheat and cotton imports that the
Pakistani government sells to farmers and consumers at subsidized
prices.
   The largest of these ``commodity import programs'' benefit Egypt
and Pakistan. Egypt has had $3 billion worth of this kind of aid
since 1975, the report said.
   Official AID policy holds that goods received by
government-owned enterprises at subsidized prices hurt a country's
development because they discourage sales at market prices.
   The GAO also reported that the Egyptian government had piled up
$325 million worth of Egyptian pounds _ representing more than half
the proceeds from sales of U.S. aid goods _ instead of using the
money for development projects.
   ``... The cost of this large accumulation of local currencies
remaining idle is high in terms of missed opportunities to support
development,'' the report said.
   The report included a memo from Richard E. Bissell, the
assistant AID administrator, saying that the Egyptian government
has tentatively promised to release about $165 million worth of the
local currency for development efforts this year and next.
   The congressional investigators said that when asked about the
situation, AID officials in Pakistan and Egypt ``acknowledged the
detrimental effects of subsidies, but said the political dimension
of these programs limited their leverage in moving these programs
to achieve greater impact.''

   Police arrested 214 of about 1,000
demonstrators who tried unsuccessfully to blockade the Pentagon
during a protest of U.S. policy on El Salvador.
   Authorities said most of the arrests Monday were on charges of
obstructing passage.
   There were scattered episodes of fisticuffs between police and
demonstrators, and three people were charged with assault, but the
protesters failed to achieve their goal of stopping Pentagon
workers from entering the building.
   The demonstration was sponsored by a coalition of a half-dozen
peace groups.
   The protesters succeeded in forcing Defense Department workers
to abandon the huge parking lot south of the Pentagon _ which
normally accommodates 3,700 cars _ and to run a human gauntlet
through selected entrances to get to their offices.
   ``But they didn't shut down the building; they just created a
lot of inconvenience and long walks,'' said Glenn Flood, a Pentagon
spokesman.
   Police, including one officer who was attacked by protesters,
arrested several people when they sat in a road to block a military
bus from entering the parking lot.
   One demonstrator sprayed red paint across the front of a bus.
Protesters then pushed one Defense Protective Service officer to
the ground when he tried to arrest the demonstrator and beat the
officer before other officers rescued him.
   The demonstrators oppose U.S. aid to the Salvadoran government,
which has been engaged in a war against leftist guerrillas since
1980. An estimated 60,000 people have died in that conflict, which
has produced continuing allegations of ``death squad'' killings by
policemen and soldiers.
   The United States considers El Salvador one of its closest
allies in Central America.
   The protesters maintain the leftist guerrillas are willing to
negotiate an end to the fighting but that the Salvadoran government
_ backed by the United States _ refuses to compromise in any way.
   On Monday, they offered loud chants of opposition to U.S.
policies, yelling: ``No violence, no war, U.S. out of El
Salvador,'' and ``Hey hey, ho ho, the Pentagon has got to go.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the latest auction to the highest level in more
than three years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.1 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 7.36 percent, up from 7.32
percent last week. Another $7.0 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.55 percent, up from 7.46 percent
last week.
   The rates were the highest since May 13, 1985, when three-month
bills sold for 7.69 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.90
percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.60 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,814.00 and and 7.96 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,618.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 8.07 percent
last week after averaging 8.13 percent the week before.

more lucrative outlets for white operators.
   The discrimination and anti-trust lawsuit, filed in U.S.
District Court in Washington on Monday, charged that Burger King
also gave white operators more favorable financing terms.
   Blacks were charged as much as twice what white operators paid
to purchase or lease stores and equipment, the lawsuit said.
   Joyce Myers, a Burger King spokeswoman, said Monday, ``We can't
really respond until we have had an opportunity to see the suit and
evaluate what the allegations are.''
   The Miami-based company also was accused of discouraging black
franchise holders from expanding to other locations by thwarting
their attempts to obtain loans.
   The black operators also charged that the company did not give
them the opportunity to obtain franchises for lucrative downtown
locations, which subsequently were awarded to whites.
   Blacks who were awarded franchises in middle- and upper-income
neighborhoods were leased stores that had ``deficient equipment,
poor dining facilities, poor parking and drive-thru locations and
inferior sales potential,'' the suit said.
   The lawsuit, which seeks $500 million in punitive and
compensatory damages, also accused company officials of trying to
``harass, threaten, coerce, intimidate and otherwise malign''
franchise holders after learning of their plans to file the suit.
   The lawsuit also charged that Burger King intentionally
misrepresented the sales potential of locations sold to black
operators.
   In addition to the 12 named plaintiffs, the lawsuit was brought
on behalf of some 100 current and former black franchise holders by
the Minority Business Enterprise Legal Defense & Education Fund, a
non-profit, public-interest law firm.

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush may be the
attention-getters but they certainly won't be the only presidential
candidates on the ballot on Election Day.
   Democrat Dukakis and Republican Bush will appear in some states
with a host of lesser-knowns, each of whom wants that coveted job
as leader of the free world.
   From New York psychologist Lenora B. Fulani of the New Alliance
party to Libertarian Ron Paul of Texas, the handful of long shot
presidential hopefuls runs the spectrum of political leanings.
   There are 17 other-party candidates in all, according to the
Federal Election Commission.
   Some are not new to the process. Former Minnesota Sen. Eugene J.
McCarthy, an unsuccessful candidate in 1968 for the Democratic
presidential nomination who also ran in 1972 and 1976, materializes
again this year on four state ballots.
   The 72-year-old is cast as a Progressive in Minnesota, an
independent in Michigan and a consumer candidate in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. He entered the 1988 race, he says, because ``there is
no real choice between Democrats and Republicans.''
   This time around, McCarthy proclaims, ``I don't expect to lose.''
   Fulani, the first black female presidential candidate to win a
ballot slot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, has a
more modest goal in mind _ to see that Dukakis gets buried on Nov.
8.
   The standard-bearer of the New Alliance party, which originally
supported the candidacy of Democrat Jesse Jackson, Fulani says she
hopes to draw enough votes away from Dukakis to make the Democratic
Party take notice.
   Asked which candidate she prefers, Fulani says, ``That's like
asking black people in slavery if they'd rather have a good master
or a bad one. ... I don't like their parties. They're plastic
people.''
   Another long shot presidential hopeful is Ron Paul, appearing on
most ballots as a Libertarian. A former Republican congressman from
Texas, he quit the GOP in 1987 saying President Reagan had presided
over a government of massive budget deficits and too many
bureaucrats.
   Given a choice, Paul says, he would ``deregulate everything and
you get rid of all the bums, all the bureaucrats who are running
the bureaus.''
   And there are lesser-known candidates as well, including
Socialist Willa Kenoyer, who will appear on seven state ballots.
   ``I learned my socialism on my daddy's knee back in the
mid-1930s,'' said Kenoyer, a free-lance writer from Shelby, Mich.
   While she says her party is more interested in spreading its
ideas than trying to put a socialist in the White House, she still
has plans should she happen to make it that far.
   The first hour, Kenoyer says, would be spent dismantling the
CIA. ``The second hour, the FBI goes.''
   Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, under indictment for fraud
and conspiracy, is also listed in several states, often under the
banner of National Economic Recovery Party or Democrats for
Economic Recovery Party.
   Historically, third-party candidates have a difficult time. In
1968, then-segregationist George Wallace of Alabama mounted the
biggest vote-getting campaign for a third-party candidate in the
nation's history _ and he attracted just 10 million votes.
   In 1984, Libertarian David Bergland finished in third place
behind Reagan and Walter F. Mondale, drawing only 227,204 votes.

   The presidential campaign motorcade
speeds down a Texas freeway at about 75 mph but without Secret
Service agents, a police escort and highway roadblocks.
   The motorcade consists of three cars _ the candidate in the
front seat of a four-door Ford that has a radar detector perched on
the dashboard and two reporters weaving their vehicles in and out
of traffic, desperately trying to keep pace.
   This is no ordinary national political campaign.
   If a dark suit, light blue shirt and red striped tie make for
the classic uniform of a presidential hopeful, then Ron Paul is
playing the part correctly. But that's where the similarity to
Republican nominee George Bush and Democratic contender Michael
Dukakis ends.
   The 53-year-old Paul, a former four-term GOP congressman from
Texas, is the Libertarian Party nominee for president. His campaign
is low-key and its operating budget miniscule compared to Bush and
Dukakis, but he will share a ballot spot next month with his
better-known rivals in 47 states and the District of Columbia.
   ``The odds aren't very good,'' Paul said of his presidential
chances during a recent campaign stop in Jersey Village, northwest
of Houston. ``But the odds are very good that we are going to take
hold in this country. We're realistic in knowing we're not going to
be elected this year, but we're not a fly-by-night operation.''
   Paul's campaign is not so much aimed at electing him but about
promoting the philosophy of the Libertarians, who claim a
membership of more than 200,000 nationwide. The party has fielded a
presidential candidate in every election since 1972 and garnered
about 250,000 votes in the 1984 contest.
   Paul, by profession an obstetrician and gynecologist, rarely
refers to himself during campaign appearances, preferring instead
to tout his party's goals of a completely free marketplace,
unbridled civil liberties and a non-interventionist foreign policy.
   ``We're spoiling the comfort of the politicians who won't deal
with the problems and are bankrupting the country,'' he said.
``That's a great role.''
   Paul, a true opponent of government interference and
bureaucracy, favors abolishing the personal income tax and the
Internal Revenue Service, disbanding the FBI, pulling U.S. troops
out of Europe and the Far East and eliminating all drug laws, thus
making illegal drugs legal.
   He would also let private firms handle Social Security, return
the country to the gold standard and get the government out of
public education.
   Paul, who served in Congress from 1976 to 1984, says he quit the
Republicans after becoming disenchanted with Ronald Reagan.
   ``He told me he would get the government off my back,'' he said.
``But look what's happening. If you look at the IRS or DEA or INS
or whoever, they're not off our backs. They're into our wallets and
into our bedrooms and into our private lives more so than ever
before.''
   His rather populist message draws a smattering of enthusiastic
applause during campaign appearances. On the drug issue, however,
some of the opposition can get hostile, especially when Paul
suggests it should be left up to the individual whether to use
narcotics.
   ``I was in favor of everything he says until he got to the drug
issue,'' Joseph Azmeh, 19, a University of Houston student, said
after a recent Paul campaign appearance. ``I have a small brother
and he watches TV and I know how advertising affects him.''
   Paul believes making drugs legal would reduce crime by 50
percent and eliminate the profit motive for drug dealers since the
substances would be readily available.
   ``It's pretty hard to get a young person to work for $4 an hour
when they can make $400 a day pushing drugs,'' he said. ``Those
profits and high salaries would be gone if drugs weren't so
artificially pumped up in price.''
   He also draws disapproving murmurs when he suggests that the
nation's space program should be left to private companies.
   ``Whether or not I ever run for another office again is
irrelevant,'' Paul said. ``I'm dealing in ideas that are important
to me and my family. I know I will work for those ideas because
they are so important and so valuable.''
   After nearly 10 months full-time on the campaign trail, after
appearances in nearly all of the states, Paul says he has a feeling
of ``tiredness but not futility.''
   ``I see in the 1990s we could very well be a major party,'' he
says.

<HEAD>Black Vote Less Critical In Senate Races</HEAD>

   Black voters will be having less of a decisive
impact in this year's Senate races than two years ago, even though
two candidates are black, because few of the contests are being
held in the South.
   ``There aren't as many races in which the black vote is a
powerful bloc this time,'' said Tom Mason, a spokesman for the
National Republican Senatorial Committee.
   Two years ago, Senate elections were held in seven Southern
states, four of which have blacks comprising more than 20 percent
of their voting age population. In all seven states Democrats were
elected or re-elected to the Senate.
   That arithmetic was not lost on Jesse Jackson, who tried to
wring endorsements for his presidential campaign out of Southern
senators, saying they owed their jobs to black voters.
   This year, however, there are but three Southern races for the
Senate, Florida, Mississippi and Virginia, and in just one,
Mississippi, is there a high concentration of black voters. More
than 30 percent of Mississippi's voting age population is black.
   However, in that state neither Republican Trent Lott nor
Democrat Wayne Dowdy, both of whom are congressmen running to
succeed retiring Sen. John Stennis, has tailored his campaign
messages to make a special appeal to blacks, although both
acknowledge the importance of such a large bloc of voters, their
campaign spokesmen said.
   ``Our message is very simple: We are offering opportunity,'' Tim
Carpenter, campaign manager for Lott, said in a telephone
interview. ``We want to bring more and better jobs to Mississippi.''
   ``If you look all over our advertising, it's pretty monotone,''
he said.
   Lott's strategy to win black support is direct: ``We're
asking,'' said Carpenter. ``That sounds pretty simple, but we are.''
   ``We're not giving up any vote to Wayne Dowdy,'' he said.
   ``He's spending a lot of money,'' said Dowdy campaign spokesman
Dean Pittman. ``But basically what he's spending money on is
disguising his abysmal record on civil rights.''
   While polls show Lott leading overall in the Senate race, they
also indicate he has barely dented black support for Dowdy.
   An independent poll conducted in late September and early
October by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research showed Lott leading Dowdy
49 percent to 41 percent with 10 percent undecided. Among black
voters, though, the poll shows Dowdy with a 10-to-1 lead over Lott.
   The poll, which surveyed 812 likely voters, has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
   Although there are two major-party black candidates running for
the Senate this year, Maurice Dawkins in Virginia and Alan L. Keyes
in Maryland, both are Republicans and are considered long shots in
races against popular Democrats, former Gov. Charles Robb in
Virginia and Sen. Paul Sarbanes in Maryland.
   Both Republicans and Democrats say the two black Senate
candidates are not tokens nominated to water down traditional
support for the Democrats.
   ``Dawkins ... was in no sense hand-picked,'' said Anita Dunn,
spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ``In
Keyes' case, he has fought any attempt to make it look like he is a
token black running.''

<HEAD>With PM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential nominee George Bush held
a 17-point lead in a new national poll, and nearly three quarters
of the respondents said they expected him to win next month's
election.
   The NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll Monday put the race at
55-38 percent, Bush's biggest lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis
since the campaign began. The margin was considerably greater than
in surveys earlier this month.
   Told of the result, Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas
said: ``I don't believe it.'' He said the campaign's own polls
indicated a smaller, unspecified deficit, with more undecided
voters.
   It was the first full-sized poll after Thursday's debate, in
which smaller overnight polls found Bush the winner. Bush led
Dukakis by 10 points in those polls, but they were conducted only
among debate viewers, a more Republican group. Bush led by five or
six points in most pre-debate polls.
   Said Brountas: ``If there has been an increase in the gap it may
be attributable to some of the stories about the debate.''
   The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Friday through Sunday among
1,378 likely voters and had a three-point margin of error. Almost
three-quarters of the respondents said they expected Bush to win
the election, including half of Dukakis' own supporters.
   Dukakis was rated favorably by 36 percent, down from 50 percent
a month ago. Bush was favorably rated by 55 percent, up from 50
percent. Bush led chiefly among men: They backed him by 64-30
percent, while the race among women was a nearly even, with Bush
ahead 48-44.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alderman Edward Burke, a feisty onetime policeman
known as a political opponent of the late Mayor Harold Washington,
said Monday he would run for mayor and try to unite the city.
   Burke's entry is another in a crowded field of Democratic
candidates seeking to win a special mayoral election and serve the
final two years of Washington's four-year term.
   The city's first black mayor, who died suddenly last November,
considered Burke, who is white, one of his chief opponents in the
City Council.
   Burke, acknowledging his reputation might be tarnished among
blacks and some liberals by council battles against Washington
allies, said he should have acted differently.
   ``It takes humility to admit publicly that I have made mistakes,
and there are many things I would change,'' he said. ``But I would
be unfit for future government service if I did not have the
strength to admit my errors.''
   Burke, 45, said he would stay in the race ``if the money is
there, if I have support.''
   Burke has served in the City Council since 1969 when, at age 24,
he succeeded his late father, Alderman Joseph Burke.
   A week after Washington's death, aldermen installed Eugene
Sawyer as acting mayor. He is expected to run next year but has not
made an official announcement.
   Alderman Tim Evans also is expected to be a candidate, although
he has not made an official declaration. Rounding out the
Democratic field, Aldermen Danny Davis and Lawrence Bloom, former
parks boss Edmund Kelly and former Alderman Aloysius Majerczyk say
they will be in the February primary.

   A 76-year-old woman who had been in a coma
since surgeons placed her in ``suspended animation'' six week ago
to remove an egg-sized aneurysm near her brain has died.
   Cecilia Duffy of Pittsburgh died Monday, hours after she was
transferred to D.T. Watson Rehabilitation Hospital for therapy.
   She suffered cardio-pulmonary arrest, said John Righetti
spokesman at the suburban hospital.
   Duffy had been listed in fair condition before being transferred
from Allegheny General Hospital, said Allegheny General spokeswoman
Karen Long.
   Surgeons at Allegheny General put Duffy in a coma Aug. 31 and
stopped her heart 51 minutes so they could remove the aneurysm.
   During the operation, doctors reduced her body temperature by 40
degrees, drained her blood and placed her in ``suspended
animation,'' which lets surgeons cure high-risk aneurysms once
considered inoperable.
   Doctors said Duffy opened her eyes in late September for the
first time after the operation. She was transferred to D.T. Watson
so she could begin undergoing rehabilitative therapy designed to
help the injured brain heal.

   Lions stopped roaring Monday as flames
threatened a shelter for abandoned exotic animals, as well as a
home for disturbed children, and a second blaze headed toward
ancient trees in Sequoia National Park as fires burned more than
5,900 acres in California.
   ``If the wind picks up it could flare up into a 40-foot sheet of
fire and a fireball could roll over us without batting an eyelid,''
said Martine Colette, spokeswoman for Wildlife Waystation, the
animal shelter in Angeles National Forest's Little Tujunga Canyon
area 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   Several blazes, including a 1,500-acre fire burning near trees
up to 2,700 years old in Sequoia, erupted during the weekend when
California was blasted with temperatures near 100 degrees in some
areas and dry desert wind gusting to 30 mph.
   National Weather Service meteorologist Mark McKinley said
southern California will experience a cooling trend in the next
couple of days but, with 25 mph mountain wind, conditions wouldn't
change much for firefighters until Tuesday night or Wednesday
morning.
   U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Marilyn Hartley said the
3,100-acre Divide brush fire was 1{ miles from Wildlife Waystation,
but Colette insisted flames pushed to within three-quarters of a
mile. The shelter is home to more than 1,000 creatures, including
tigers, giraffes and a wide variety of other abandoned exotic pets,
plus wild animals that wandered into residential neighborhoods.
   ``We will have to make our stand here,'' Colette said. ``It
would not be feasible to evacuate the animals. ... The animals are
extremely quiet. The lions stopped roaring and the coyotes stopped
howling. They can smell the fire.''
   The refuge was expected to remain safe as long as winds didn't
whip up during the night, Waystation vice president Jan Brown said
late Monday.
   The fire, which was 20 percent contained, moved toward and then
past about seven homes in the Little Tujunga Canyon area north of
Sylmar and northeast of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. There was
no damage but most of the families evacuated, said Los Angeles
County sheriff's Sgt. Guy Gutierrez.
   Officials at the Waystation and at Hathaway Childrens Services,
a home for 125 emotionally disturbed children in Little Tujunga
Canyon, also were told they might need to evacuate if the fire got
closer, the sergeant said.
   Officials estimated that blaze will be surrounded by fire lines
by Wednesday evening and extinguished two days later, Forest
Service spokeswoman Kim Vanderhaar said. Two firefighters suffered
minor injuries.
   More than 600 firefighters were aided by nine air tankers and
three helicopters that began dropping water and fire-retardant
chemicals at dawn Monday as the blaze burned dry brush in
inaccessible mountainous terrain, said Los Angeles County
firefighter Stan Pearson.
   Three men were initially suspected of starting the fire with an
illegal campfire, a felony punishable by up to six years in prison.
But the men were released Monday, said Deputy Hal Grant, because,
``It appears a 10-year-old boy has admitted to it.''
   In Sequoia National Park, 600 firefighters battled to protect
the 3-square-mile Giant Forest, a grove of trees considered the
largest living things on Earth, said Forest Service spokeswoman
Michele Case.
   Flames ``are right now at the edge of the forest,'' but a
successful backfire broadened a buffer zone around the grove, she
said.
   The majestic trees can survive fires because their thick bark
can withstand considerable heat and flame, but ``a sequoia tree is
fire-resistant, not fireproof,'' Case said.
   Authorities also were concerned about a restaurant, hotel,
cabins and gas station about three miles from the flames, she added.
   Case said the fire broke out Sunday morning at a camping area on
the middle fork of the Kaweah River, about 30 miles northeast of
Visalia and 175 miles north of Los Angeles. One hundred campers
left so a fire camp could be established, she added.
   The fire was blamed on a careless camper or fisherman because
there was no lightning in the area at the time, Case said.
   Firefighters contained a brush fire Monday that burned more than
800 acres in Riverside County near Hemet, said Cheri Hill, a
spokeswoman for the California Division of Forestry.
   A 300-acre brush fire burned out of control near U.S. 95 about
20 miles north of Blythe near the Arizona border, Hill said. It
threatened some homes Sunday but posed no danger to dwellings
Monday, she added.
   Hill said 15 small brush fires that started Sunday throughout
Riverside County were extinguished. Some were arson, others were
caused by campfires and one was ignited by a motorcycle's hot
exhaust pipe, she said.
   Two more weekend fires erupted in the mountainous eastern
section of the Angeles National Forest. One destroyed a house near
the Mount Baldy ski resort.

   In 1987, the market was one of 10 Jewish businesses and three

night of attacks against Jewish businesses in Nazi Germany.
   Kosher Zion's windows were smashed last year, Plotsky said.
   The 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, which means ``the night

   State officials Monday were granted
custody of 55 hungry children taken from a farmhouse where an
8-year-old girl allegedly was beaten to death by staff members of a
California religious center.
   The girl, the daughter of Ecclesia Athletic Association founder
Eldridge Broussard Jr., was taken to a fire station Friday by four
adults connected with Broussard's group. She was already dead.
   Dayna Lorea Broussard had been beaten and whipped severely,
state Medical Examiner Dr. Larry Lewman said.
   Some of the other children bore marks and scars, said Bart
Wilson, Clackamas County branch manager of the state Children's
Service Division.
   ``We're led to believe that abuse had occurred,'' Wilson said.
``It's our recommendation that these children remain in protective
custody, at least for a period of time.''
   Clackamas County Circuit Judge Patrick Gilroy agreed, granting
custody of the youngsters to the state Children's Services Division
on grounds of neglect and improper care.
   In Los Angeles, meanwhile, Broussard's 25-year-old brother,
Alvin, posted $3,000 bail after he was booked Sunday for
investigation of child endangerment, said Los Angeles Police Cmdr.
William Booth. An arraignment was scheduled Nov. 10, Booth said
Monday.
   In Oregon, the children, ranging in age from 1{ months to 16
years, were sleeping on pillows on the floor of the sparsely
furnished four-bedroom house, Wilson said. They were placed in
state juvenile centers and foster homes over the weekend.
   ``They were quite hungry when they arrived. It seems that they
only had a tomato apiece on Friday,'' said Bill Carey, acting
director of client services for the state Children's Services
Division.
   According to authorities, the children were subjected to
systematic beatings with a paddle or electrical cord used to apply
up to 800 strokes in front of other children, who were required to
keep count. The trauma of receiving and witnessing such punishments
has caused psychological damage to the youngsters, the Clackamas
County Juvenile Department told the court.
   The department's director, Donald Welch, said the children ``had
been unfed for an extended period of time and were in need of
immediate nutrition. .. They ate voluminously when afforded the
opportunity.''
   Representatives of 15 of the 18 families involved, from
California, met with officials later in the day, and indicated they
knew their children were in Oregon, Wilson said. He said no visits
would be allowed immediately.
   Another, unrelated religious boarding home, the Bethel Home for
Children outside Lucedale, Miss., fell afoul of Mississippi
authorities in June because of alleged abuse of troubled or
neglected youths.
   Law enforcement officials clashed with the school's founder, the
Rev. Herman Fountain, a former heroin addict turned independent
Baptist minister. A grand jury next week will consider felony
assault charges against Fountain, but no abuse or neglect charges
were filed and the school is back in business.
   In another court hearing Monday, an attorney for Willie K.
Chambers, one of the four people charged in the death, asked that
the Broussard girl's body not be released pending an independent
autopsy.
   A murder charge against Chambers, 35, of San Diego, was reduced
to first-degree manslaughter, and the other defendants, who had
been held on murder charges, were charged with manslaughter.
   Bail was set at $250,000 apiece for Chambers, Brian James
Brinson, 30; Constance Zipporah Jackson, 37; and Frederick Paul
Doolittle, 28, all of Los Angeles.
   Clackamas County District Judge Steven L. Maurer set preliminary
hearings for Oct. 21 for Chambers and Oct. 24 for the other three.
   Alfred J. French III, a deputy Clackamas County district
attorney, said the charges were reduced because of difficulty in
proving intent. A grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the
case this week.
   Broussard attended the hearing, but declined to speak to
reporters.
   The onetime college athlete, also leader of the Watts Christian
Center in Los Angeles, was interviewed by Clackamas County
sheriff's detectives Sunday, but declined to address a news
conference. In a statement to a Portland television reporter, he
said the media had slanted stories about Ecclesia and portrayed him
as a ``crackpot.''
   ``Our whole group has been pressured into all manner of
activities we would not have had to do had we been understood a
little better,'' he told KATU-TV. He did not elaborate.
   Broussard, 35, was a star basketball player at Pacific
University in Forest Grove, Ore., in the 1970s. He founded the
Ecclesia Athletic Association in 1975.
   Last year, Ecclesia officials claimed to have established a camp
at the farm near Sandy to train children for the Olympics. But it
was unclear whether the children found Friday were in a similar
training program.
   The organization brought an estimated 70 to 100 men, women and
children from Los Angeles to the Sandy area in April 1987. They
returned to Los Angeles in June 1987 after neighbors opposed
Ecclesia's applications for zoning permits to allow 55 children and
45 adults to live in tents and use portable toilets and showers.
   Carolyn Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for Broussard, said Ecclesia no
longer exists in name but continues in spirit and concept.
   She said the group sometimes uses ``physical correction'' as a
form of discipline, but denied the punishment was cruel.
   Two other members of Broussard's group were held pending
$100,000 bail each on charges of hindering prosecution. They were
identified as Sherion Melinda Johnson, 32, and Josie Ruth Faust,
50, both of Los Angeles.
   In Los Angeles, Alvin Broussard was taken into custody at the
Watts Christian Center after five children, believed to have been
transported from Ecclesia, were found at the south-central Los
Angeles center Sunday afternoon.
   ``One of the boys had evidence that he was physically assaulted
while in Oregon,'' Booth said in Los Angeles. ``One of the boys
probably was physically abused here.'' The spokesman could not
release the names of the minors, only saying that the boys were 10
and 15 and three girls ranged in age from 10 to 17.
   The children were placed with the Los Angeles County Departent
of Children's Services. It was not immediately determined whether
the girls had been abused.
   The younger Broussard and the children were the only ones at the
Watts center at the time of the arrest, Booth said.

<HEAD>Ex President Galtieri Defends 1982 Decision To Invade Falklands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Gen. Leopoldo
Galtieri, on trial for mismanaging the 1982 war with Britain over
the Falkland Islands, says he would invade the territory again and
does not regret starting a war.
   ```Would I do it again? Given the same circumstances and
conditions, would I proceed in the same manner? The answer is yes.
I, Lt. Gen. Galtieri, would proceed the same way as I did,''
Galtieri said in Federal Appeals Court on Monday. ``What was done,
was done well.''
   Galtieri and two other members of the former ruling junta _ Adm.
Jorge Anaya and Brig. Gen. Basilio Lami Dozo _ were convicted in
May 1986 by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces of military
mismanagement. All were sentenced to prison.
   On July 26, their appeal began in civilian court, along with
three officers who had been acquitted by the military's highest
tribunal: Vice Adm. Juan Jose Lombardo, Gen. Mario Menendez, and
Gen. Omar Parada.
   The issue is how the war was handled, including Galtieri's
decision to send about 12,000 troops to the islands, located 250
miles northeast of Tierra del Fuego off the southernmost tip of
South America.
   Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo questioned the military's tactics
and strategy, including Anaya's decision, as head of the navy, to
virtually withdraw the fleet from combat after the cruiser General
Belgrano was sunk in early May by a British nuclear submarine.
   Argentine conscripts were ill-trained, inadequately supplied and
poorly led, witnesses said.
   The conflict began on April 2, 1982, and lasted 74 days. About
700 Argentines were killed along with 255 British troops.
   In his defense, Galtieri said the war for the islands that
Argentina calls the Malvinas was narrowly lost, so charges of
mismanagement are ill-founded.
   ``The battle for the South Atlantic, militarily, was lost by a
narrow margin,'' he said.
   Britain claimed the islands in 1833. Argentina claims it
inherited the islands from Spain upon achieving independence in
1810.
   The underpopulated, windswept islands are home to about 1,900
people, mostly sheep ranchers and fishermen. Also at stake are the
rights to potentially large deposits of oil and other natural
resources.
   For Argentina, nationalism is a factor. Every map calls the
islands the Malvinas. Every school child learns they were seized
from Argentina and should be returned.
   Galtieri, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the
military tribunal and who faces a stiffer, 20-year sentence if he
loses his appeal, was not repentant when he addressed the civilian
court.
   ``In 1982, destiny knocked at the doors of the nation,'' he
said. ``And the people, with dignity, decided to fulfill a
historical obligation'' and reclaim the islands.
   The court's decision was expected by early next week.

<HEAD>New AIDS TV Spots Avoid The `C' Word</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top federal official says Americans should
look to television networks and other news outlets if they think
the government should be more forthright in calling for use of
condoms to combat the spread of AIDS.
   A new wave of television spots unveiled Monday does not mention
what one reporter called ``the C word'' but leaves little to the
imagination of any viewer who has heard that condoms can help
prevent spread of the deadly disease.
   The 1987 series of television ads distributed to national
networks and thousands of individual stations contained direct
references to condoms in some spots that got little airplay despite
$18 million worth of free airtime devoted to less controversial
messages.
   Nonetheless, one of the 1988 ads features a tantalizing episode
in which a young man talks to the camera as he puts a sock on his
foot.
   ``If I told you I could save my life just by putting on my
socks, you wouldn't take me seriously,'' says the man, sitting in a
chair.
   ``Because life is never that simple,'' he adds.
   ``But watch ...''
   There are a few seconds of silence as he slips a sock onto his
foot.
   ``Okay, you're right,'' the man says. ``That wouldn't really
save my life. But there's something just as simple that could.''
   Questioned at a news conference, Dr. James Mason, director of
the Centers for Disease Control, said there was a simple answer to
why the government avoided specifically mentioning condoms in the
new round of television spots.
   ``We had a great deal of difficulty getting the television
stations to use that,'' he said, referring to 1987 spots that
specifically mentioned condoms. ``That one was selectively avoided
by the television stations.''
   Mason said designers of the 1987 ad campaign tried to be careful
to produce spots that would not be offensive to audiences even
though some of them did discuss condoms.
   But he said experience showed ``there was another level of
screening'' at networks and local TV stations that resulted in the
condom spots rarely being seen by a general audience.
   With more than a dozen cameras rolling, Mason was among several
officials who declined to answer directly when asked whether
television executives were engaging in irresponsible behavior in
public health by declining to run condom spots.
   Eventually, Stephanie Lee-Miller, the administration's top
public relations official in the Health and Human Services
Department who had been moderating the news conference, stepped
forward.
   ``I'll answer it,'' she said. ``No, they're not engaging in
responsible behavior.''
   She asked reporters to ``challenge the networks'' rather than
the health department.
   Indeed, the print ads and posters prepared for the new campaign
deals with condom use in a direct way likely to draw criticism from
conservatives.
   ``If He Won't Wear A Condom, Call For Help,'' says one suggested
newspaper ad.
   One of numerous posters features a still photo from the TV spot
where the man is putting a sock on his foot. ``Putting On A Condom
Is Just As Simple,'' says the headline.
   Another series of six posters feature photos of three different
men and three different women with the same headline on each: `What
Have You Got Against A Condom?'' The smaller print says, ``The
simple act of putting on a condom can save your life, if they're
used properly and every time you have sex. For more information
about AIDS and condoms, call 1-800-342-AIDS.''
   Another series features three different women all saying, ``If
he doesn't have a condom, you just have to take a deep breath and
tell him to go get one.''
   Many critics have said federal officials and Ogilvy & Mather,
the private advertising company hired to produce the campaign, went
too far last year in trying to get sexually active Americans to use
condoms. Others said the ads were not explicit enough.
   Mason said federal health officials have always said that
abstinence or a monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner
are the only two absolute ways to prevent sexual spread of AIDS.
   ``Condoms are third best,'' he said, adding it is nonetheless
important for health officials to recommend their use for those who
are not abstinent or in monogamous relationships with partners they
are certain are uninfected.

<HEAD>Award Winning Author of `In The Heat Of The Night' Dead at 77</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Ball, who won the coveted Edgar Award
for mystery writers for ``In The Heat Of The Night,'' a
groundbreaking novel about a black detective, has died. He was 77.
   The Los Angeles resident whose approximately 30 books have bene
translated into 17 languages, died Saturday after a two-year battle
with cancer, said his wife, Patricia.
   A new murder mystery, titled ``The Van,'' will be published this
spring, she said Monday.
   Ball worked as a music critic for the Brooklyn Eagle, music
columnist for the New York World Telegram and assistant curator for
the Hayden Planetarium in New York.
   Most of his books were mysteries, but he also wrote in the
juvenile, aviation and military fields.
   It was as a mystery writer in California, following in the steps
of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, that Ball gained renown.
   Instead of hard-boiled world weary gumshoes like Sam Spade and
Philip Marlowe, Ball created a soft-spoken policeman, who happened
to be black.
   It was a bold move that anticipated principal roles for black
characters in popular fiction and film.
   ``They told him `No, don't make him black. Why not make him
Chinese or something,''' said his wife. ``But John insisted. Virgil
Tibbs must be black.''
   Thus was born the character played by Sidney Poitier in the
movie ``In The Heat Of The Night,'' which won four Oscars in 1967
for picture, actor (Rod Steiger), director (Norman Jewison) and
screenplay (Stirling Silliphant).
   ``Believe it or not, it took a long time to get it published,''
Mrs. Ball said. ``He was going to let it go for almost nothing.''
   The book was in the hands of a small publisher that went out of
business, so it was picked up by another publisher, his wife said.
   For his own part, Ball received the Edgar Award conferred by the
Mystery Writers of America and the Golden Dagger by the British
Crime Writers, his wife said.
   The Tibbs character usually faced prejudice in addition to
problems of detection, but maintained his cool and went on to crack
the case in Mississippi while on a visit, using his intellect and
forensic expertise.
   Another Ball book, ``The First Team'' about a war with the
Soviet Union was published in 1971, more than a decade ahead of
such currently popular works as ``The Hunt for Red October'' by Tom
Clancy and ``Team Yankee'' by Harold Coyle.
   ``The First Team'' sold to a movie studio, but got shelved in
the early days of detente with the Soviet Union in the 1970s.
   ``It was long before `Red Dawn,''' she said of the recent movie
about a Soviet invasion of the United States.
   Services were set for Wednesday at Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn.
   In addition to his wife, he was survived by his son, John David
Ball, and his granddaughter, Nicole.

<HEAD>Four States Decide Whether To Gamble On Lotteries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBBIE NEWBY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in four states will decide
whether to take a chance on a lottery in ballot measures opposed by
religious leaders and others who say state-sanctioned gambling
exploits the poor.
   Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky and Minnesota have lottery questions on
Nov. 8's ballot. The Indiana proposition also would clear the way
for parimutuel and casino gambling, if the Legislature approves.
   Polls in the states indicate support for the issues.
   Proponents, who include Gov. Wallace Wilkinson in Kentucky and
state Sen. Larry Borst in Indiana, say voting ``yes'' would bring
millions of dollars into state coffers, including much-needed money
for education and rural economic development.
   Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia operate
lotteries, which have grossed $14.8 billion in fiscal 1988, up 19.2
percent from 1987, according to Gambling and Wagering Business
Magazine based in New York. Of that sum, $5.6 billion went to state
governments and the balance to cover prizes and the cost of
administration, according to lottery officials.
   Opponents argue lotteries encourage betting by the people who
can least afford it.
   ``There are only 3.5 million people in Kentucky,'' said Jim
Fugitte of Elizabethtown, Ky., chairman of Citizens Against State
Lottery. ``A million of them are under 18 and 1 million are under
the poverty level. ... We can't be for something where the more the
citizens of Kentucky bet and lose, the better off the state is.''
   Indiana Citizens Against Legalized Gambling hopes to spend
$350,000 on advertisements and pamphlets arguing that gambling
would attract organized crime to the state. United Methodist
Churches held a ``Get Out the Vote Sunday'' to encourage
congregations to vote no.
   Supporters such as Borst counter that such opponents ``are our
best salesmen so far as making people aware of it.''
   Church leaders in Minnesota including all Lutheran and Roman
Catholic bishops said they will spend the next few weeks urging
congregations to vote no.
   Opposition in Idaho gained impetus when Morman leaders, usually
apolitical in state affairs, began organizing against the lottery.
   A recent report by the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute predicts
a lottery would produce about $134 million in annual net revenues
for Indiana, which has 5.5 million people.
   Proponents in Kentucky estimate the lottery could mean $70
million a year for the state, while supporters in Minnesota say
ticket sales would gross $40 million to $100 million.
   In Idaho, with just 1 million residents, pressure for the
lottery has come from the western and northern parts of the state,
where promoters say the state is losing millions of dollars to
lotteries in Oregon and Washington. They project the state could
reap at least $2 million annually.
   But the Indiana institute's president, Earl M. Ryan, warns that
forecasting lottery revenues is about as chancy as winning one,
adding that it would be risky for any state to count on specific
dollar amounts.
   ``From a fiscal standpoint, the biggest problem with lottery
revenues is their unpredictability,'' Ryan said. ``This means that
it would be unwise to dedicate those revenues to functions that
require a stable resource of funding in order to operate.''
   The four states stand to lose little if they opt for the game,
said John L. Mikesell, an Indiana University School of Public and
Environmental Affairs professor who has studied lotteries.
   ``They're basically guaranteed against losing money because we
know enough about structuring prizes and operations of lottery,''
he said, adding that none should expect lotteries to be a ``booming
success'' like those in more populous, urban states such as
Massachusetts or Maryland.
   The four states voting ``either have substantially rural
populations or small populations. Some are smack-dab in between
existing lottery states that are doing pretty well or they don't
have a good tradition of gambling history,'' Mikesell said.
   That argument isn't likely to hold water in Kentucky, said
Fugitte: ``Most of the community either is neutral on the issue of
gambling or they think it's all right. You've got to remember this
is a horseracing state.''

   Flaky pastry puffs filled with
chocolate mousse float on a tray near the swirl of whipped cream
crowning a glazed bed of strawberries and a soft jelly roll oozing
with a tart burst of red.
   For most people, this is sweet torture. To those attending the
Atlantic Bakery Expo this week, this is sweetly lucrative.
   Bakers wandered through the expo at Convention Center on Monday,
admiring stainless steel mixing bowls as big as Jacuzzis, ovens as
big as dining rooms and a $14,000 machine that pops out 175 dozen
bagels an hour.
   More than 10,000 buyers were expected to attend the three-day
expo, which ends today.
   The retail baking industry generates about $6 billion nationwide
each year, with 20,000 independent retail bakers and another 20,000
in-store bakeries across the United States, according to statistics
compiled by the Retail Bakers of America Association.
   ``We could say this show smells of opportunity and tastes of
success,'' said John Charles, executive secretary of the New Jersey
Bakers Board of Trade.
   The average sweet tooth might be surprised at the innovations
for modern bakers displayed at the annual show. There are still
frosting bags and traditional wedding cake toppers decorated with
lace, but there are also gadgets such as high-tech spray guns that
use food coloring to create detailed cake-top scenes.
   ``Business has been so good that we sold our bakery two years
ago and now we sell our Stencil Aire products around the country,''
said Belinda Franklin, a co-partner in the young cake stenciling
firm based in Ripon, Wis.
   At the expo, Chris Moore, of the Hazelwood (Mo.) Farms Bakeries,
promoted a line of predecorated frozen cakes and cupcakes that
stores can thaw and sell.
   ``It's hard to find skilled labor to decorate cakes nowadays,''
he said. ``You don't find that many people want to be bakers
anymore because of the crazy hours.'' Bakers traditionally get a
predawn start on their day behind the stove.
   But bakers who still make their own cakes are turning to
products that save time. Richard D'Alco, a spokesman for
Instantwhip Food Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, pointed to a giant
strawberry shortcake frosted with Instantwhip whipped cream that
comes from a carton and doesn't use heavy cream.
   ``Real heavy cream is primarily used in gourmet operations as
long as people are willing to pay the high price,'' he said.
   But D'Alco didn't have to continue touting his product. A
husband-wife baking team stopped at his booth to rave.
   ``Real whipped cream turns into water if you beat it too much,''
said Rose Hamilton, co-owner of the Bel Air (Md.) Bakery.
   ``Fresh whipped cream is the worst thing you could use,'' said
her husband, James.
   Even the decorations on cakes can be premade. Sam Guttman,
president of Bakery Crafts of Cincinnati, pointed to his variety of
colorful plastic and hard sugar cake decorations.
   ``A lot of these decorations are labor-savers,'' he said.
``Someone who is a home cake decorator or hobbyist might be willing
to spend two to three hours to decorate a cake, but a baker can't
afford that time, unless it's a wedding cake that can cost up to
$1,000.''
   Of course, some people displaying their wares still practiced
the old art of turning frosting into fantasy. August Riesterer,
owner of the Riesterer Bakery in West Hempstead, N.Y., is a German
native who said he has been baking for 57 years.
   Riesterer sat proudly behind a display of mind-boggling cakes _
including some wedding cakes that seemed to defy gravity. One
featured three tiers atop pedestals, with bridges connecting six
smaller layers on either side. The bride and groom stood on top,
while nine bridesmaids and nine ushers climbed the tiny stairs.
   The cakes cost about $500 each, he said.

   Labor and business leaders hailed
President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari's extension of an
inflation-fighting program for one month after he takes office.
   Citing progress under the 10-month-old plan and other economic
reforms, the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Federal Reserve announced
in Washington on Monday they were preparing as much as $3.5 billion
in short-term ``bridge'' loans for Mexico.
   Under the Economic Solidarity Pact, Mexico's business, farm and
labor sectors and the government pledged last December to cooperate
in holding down wages and prices.
   The latest extension to Dec. 31, published in newspapers on
Monday, said recent measures taken by the government were helping
hold down inflation. It mentioned a new cut in government spending,
continued efforts to close or sell unprofitable and non-strategic
state companies, and maintenance of monetary and credit policies
that support price stability.
   ``We will not continue from crisis to crisis, but are going to
achieve growth without inflation,'' said Claudio X. Gonzalez,
former president of the Business Coordinating Council, in remarks
quoted by the Excelsior news service.
   Hector Hugo Olivares Ventura, leader of the National
Confederation of Campesinos, said the pact was not ``a
straitjacket'' on workers' salaries but rather ensured that wages
could be upwardly adjusted under the plan's freeze on official
prices.
   Under the reform pact, labor has foregone wage increases since
March, arguing that a small rise would give business a pretext for
price hikes _ thus causing workers to lose ground.
   Prices of basic goods are controlled, but subsidies on many
products have been gradually lifted to reduce the budget deficit.
   The monthly increase in consumer prices has been slashed from
15.5 percent in January to 0.6 percent in September under the plan.
The rate for the first nine months of the year was 45.5 percent.
When the accord was signed last December, inflation was rising to a
rate of 159.2 percent for the year.
   ``The recent trend in prices has been satisfactory since it
allowed the monthly rate of increase in September to reach the
lowest level in 12 years,'' the statement said.

   The dollar edged up agaisnt the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 127.70 yen, up 0.50 yen from Monday's close
of 127.20 yen. Opening at 127.55 yen, the currency moved in a range
of 127.20-128.00 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 37.83-point
loser the previous day, lost 126.76 points Tuesday, or 0.46
percent, to finish trading at 27,141.98. The index lost 28.41
points shortly after the market opened, then fell at a slower pace.
   ``Participants were less motivated in investing, which resulted
in thin trading,'' said an analyst who noted that news about
Emperor Hirohito's health has affected the Tokyo market more than a
economic factors.
   Japan's 87-year-old emperor has been bedridden since Sept. 19
and recently underwent a blood transfusion.
   In foreign exchange, news reports said Bank of Japan Governor
Satoshi Sumita indicated the major central banks may intervene to
support the dollar if the U.S. currency continues to decline
sharply against the yen.

<HEAD>Survey Suggests Millions of U.S. Children May Suffer Hunger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private study indicates as many as 5 million
children are going to bed hungry in the United States.
   The Food Research and Action Center made what it called the
conservative estimate after a house-to-house survey of nearly 800
low-income families in Washington state and said it would extend
the study to seven other states over the next 15 months.
   But on the basis of the early data from Washington state ``...
we estimate conservatively that 2 million to 5 million children in
this country could now have a serious hunger problem,'' Robert J.
Fersh, executive director of the center, said Monday.
   Similar studies are now under way in Minnesota, Florida,
Connecticut, California, Michigan, Alabama and New York.

<HEAD>Economic Gaps Widens Between Black And White Families</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private group says the gap between the
earnings of black and white families has widened in the 1980s.
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says increasing
poverty and economic stagnation among blacks has helped widen the
gap for both married and single-parent black families.
   ``In 1987, the income of the typical black family _ at $18,098 _
equaled just 56.1 percent of the typical white family's income
($32,274), a lower percentage than any year in the late 1970s or
late 1960s (59.2 percent),'' center Director Robert Greenstein said
Monday in a statement.
   Median family income for black families decreased by $854
between 1978 and 1987, while the median income for white families
increased $276, the study said.

   An education group says only one of six

degrees to study a foreign language.
   The study by the American Council on Education found even less
interest in languages among two-year community colleges, with only
1 percent requiring foreign language study to enter school and
about 13 percent requiring further language study for an associate
degree.
   The survey released Monday was based on replies from nearly 400

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill Regulating Indian Gambling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed legislation
setting up a commission to regulate and monitor high-stakes
gambling on Indian reservations.
   The legislation signed Monday provides for joint regulation by
the tribes and the federal government of bingo, lotto, and certain
card games. It would permit casinos, and horse and dog racing on
reservations only if the tribes enter into specific contracts with
state governments.
   Indian tribes, faced with cutbacks in federal money and a
limited tax base, have instituted gambling operations to raise
needed revenues. Bingo is the predominant form of gambling.
   Bingo, lotto, and card games will be monitored by the National
Indian Gaming Commission to be established.

Recruitment</HEAD>

   Former ``Moonies'' can sue the Unification
Church for alleged deception and brainwashing because freedom of
religion does not protect fraudulent recruiting, the state Supreme
Court said in reinstating two suits.
   A lawyer for the National Council of Churches called Monday's
6-1 ruling ``a real blow'' to freedom of religion.
   ``The challenge here ... is not to the church's teachings or to
the validity of a religious conversion,'' said Justice Stanley Mosk
in the decision.
   ``The challenge is to the church's practice of misrepresenting
or concealing its identity in order to bring unsuspecting outsiders
into its highly structured environment. That practice is not itself
belief _ it is conduct subject to regulation for the protection of
society.''
   Reversing two lower court rulings, the high court decided that
two former church members who brought their cases could seek to
convince a jury that they had been brainwashed and were unable to
exercise independent judgment when they joined the Rev. Sun Myung
Moon's church after being told of its identity.
   In dissent, Appeals Court Presiding Justice Carl Anderson,
assigned to the Supreme Court for the case, said religious
conversion _ whether or not it involves ``brainwashing'' _ is
constitutionally protected from court scrutiny.
   ```Brainwashing' and religious conversion are not really
distinguishable,'' Anderson said, noting there were no claims of
force or threatened violence in the case.
   Kenneth Ross, a lawyer for the church, said he would recommend
an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs, whose lawsuits had been rejected in
San Francisco Superior Court and a state appellate court, hailed
the ruling.
   The court recognized ``the rights of people who have been
exploited by the dishonest and unethical practice of religion,''
said Ford Greene, lawyer for David Molko.
   ``Until this case was decided, cults had taken the position that
they could do whatever they chose to do with respect to deception
and fraud in their recruitment activities and claim that they were
immune from responsibility by virtue of the First Amendment,'' said
Stanley Leal, attorney for his daughter, Tracy.
   But Kathleen Purcell, a lawyer for the American Baptist Churches
in the U.S.A. and the National Council of Churches who filed
written arguments supporting the Unification Church, called the
ruling ``a real blow to both free exercise of religion and the
separation of church and state.''
   She said it was the first ruling of its kind by any state's high
court.
   Ms. Leal, now 28 and studying for a teaching credential at San
Jose State University, was a 19-year-old college student when a
recruiter approached her at a San Francisco bus station in 1979. A
few months earlier, Molko, a 27-year-old Pennsylvania lawyer newly
arrived in San Francisco, also was recruited at a bus stop.
   Both said the recruiters denied any church affiliation, instead
claimed membership in the Creative Community Project, and invited
them to dinner. Soon afterward, they said, they were taken to a
retreat and subjected to intensive lectures, discussions and
exercise. Molko said he was not told of the Moon affiliation for 12
days, and Ms. Leal for 22 days.
   Both remained church members for several months before they were
abducted by ``deprogrammers'' hired by their parents, the court
said.
   Their lawsuits sought damages from the church for emotional
distress and punitive damages. Molko also sought return of his
$6,000 he donated to the church.

   President Corazon Aquino faces a hard
road in selling the newly concluded U.S. bases agreement to the
public and may be forced to harden her position on the thornier
issue of the installations' status after 1991.
   First reaction to the agreement, signed Monday in Washington,
was at best mixed. Major newspapers accused the government of
selling out by agreeing to allow the six bases to remain through
1991 in return for ``only'' $962 million in American aid.
   That was more than 2{ times the $180 million a year which
President Reagan pledged in 1983 over a five-year period to
now-ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.
   But the fact that the Philippines won far more U.S. assistance
was all but lost on the public and press due to the government's
having raised expectations which U.S. diplomats all along said were
unrealistic.
   Even before the talks began April 5, Manila newspapers quoted
unidentified government sources as saying the Aquino administration
would insist on $1.2 billion a year.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus never explicitly confirmed the
$1.2 billion demand but termed it ``reasonable.'' Manglapus aides
privately told Filipino reporters that the government would hold
fast to its demands.
   Manglapus himself said repeatedly that compensation was not the
only issue. But other issues he cited, such as confirmation of
nuclear weapons at the bases and expanded criminal jurisdiction
over U.S. troops, were not addressed in the new agreement.
   In Washington, Manglapus told reporters he was optimistic that
once the Filipino public understood the agreement, ``they will
accept it.''
   Indeed, one longtime bases opponent, Sen. Aquilino Pimentel,
said the results of the negotiations ``are certainly much better
than before.''
   But the absence of a detailed explanation by the government of
the benefits of the agreement opened the door to criticism from the
press and some lawmakers, who hope to make the bases an issue in
the runup to the 1992 national elections.
   Under the new Constitution, any extension after 1991 must be
approved by two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to
the bases is strong.
   Several senators are widely assumed to harbor presidential
ambitions and are casting for an issue in the 1992 election, in
which Mrs. Aquino says she will not be a candidate.
   The fact that the latest agreement was hammered out in
Washington, and not Manila, raised charges that the government had
indulged in the same kind of secret diplomacy for which the Marcos
administration had been roundly criticized.
   Manglapus has been in the United States for nearly a month. When
asked whether Mrs. Aquino herself was fully aware of all aspects of
the final negotiations, her spokesman Teodoro Benigno replied ``I
don't think so.''
   Instead, Mrs. Aquino left details of the negotiations to
Manglapus, who has not entirely shaken off his longtime image as an
``Am-Boy,'' or ``American Boy,'' a derogatory term for Filipinos
who support U.S. interests.
   That strategy appeared designed in part to allow Mrs. Aquino to
escape personal political damage if the public found the agreement
unsatisfactory.
   The results of the just concluded talks were expected to
influence the government's decision on whether to negotiate a new
pact extending the bases beyond 1991.
   Such negotiations _ assuming they are held _ will be difficult.
   Recent surveys show a majority of Filipinos favor retention of
the bases but under favorable terms, including fixed rent. But
Communist rebels and a significant portion of the urban middle
class, including journalists and intellectuals, are strongly
opposed to the bases, regardless of the financial impact if they
were closed.
   ``We seem to have hung out a price tag on our sovereignty and
national dignity,'' wrote columnist Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc in the
Philippine Daily Inquirer. ``We are now selling out even when the
price isn't right.''
   In such a climate, issues which are viewed here as basic to
national sovereignty are likely to be raised. These include formal
notification of the presence of nuclear weapons as well as military
operations launched from Philippine soil.
   Filipino military officers are routinely barred from some
sensitive areas such as code rooms, even though the six bases are
nominally under Philippine command.

   Heroin smuggling charges have been dismissed
against a key Mafia informant who testified against his associates
at the ``maxi-trial'' in Sicily and the ``pizza connection'' drug
case here.
   The U.S. government officially dropped the six-count indictment
Monday, saying Tommaso Buscetta had ``fulfilled the terms'' of his
cooperation agreement with the U.S. and Italian governments.
   ``Buscetta has provided, and continues to provide, exhaustive
information concerning the activities of the Mafia here and in
Italy,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Rose in court papers.
   ``Moreover, largely as a result of Buscetta's testimony at
trials in the United States and Italy, hundreds of defendants have
been convicted of heroin trafficking and associated organized crime
activity.''
   The drug indictment against Buscetta was filed in 1973 in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn. The order to dismiss the indictment,
which contained the only outstanding charges against Buscetta, was
signed by Judge Joseph McLaughlin.
   Its dismissal was included in a cooperation agreement Buscetta
entered with the U.S. and Italian governments in 1985.
   Rose said Buscetta had been a soldier ``of great respect'' in
the Sicilian Mafia, where his duties included settling disputes and
acting as an emissary between families.
   His testimony at the ``pizza connection'' trial helped convict
18 defendants of participating in a Mafia-backed drug racket,
operated in part through pizza parlors, that imported an estimated
$1.6 billion worth of heroin into the United States.
   He was the prosecution's first witness at the 17-month trial
that ended in March 1986, and he identified certain defendants as
members of the Sicilian Mafia.
   Buscetta also was among a dozen admitted Mafia members who
testified at the Italian trial, described as the largest Mafia
trial ever conducted. More than 300 defendants were convicted in
that case last year.
   Rose said Buscetta would remain in a witness protection program
administered by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. He has
been given a new identity and is living in this country.

   Scotland has suffered another blow to
its sense of separate identity: The English have overrun its
cultural establishment.
   Ever since 1707, when Scotland and England were united under one
crown and parliament, Scots have worried about being swamped by
their English neighbors, who outnumber them 11-1.
   Comes now ``The Englishing of Scotland,'' broadcast Aug. 29 on
the independent Scottish television channel, which shows the
command posts of Scottish culture firmly in the hands of Sassenachs
from south of the border.
   Not the artists, mind. Native Scottish creativity has never
looked healthier. What worries guardians of Scottish identity is
the preponderance of Englishmen in a cultural bureaucracy supposed
to be separate.
   ``The Englishing of Scottish life is a process that has gone on
for many years, but many Scots ... feel it is beginning to
undermine the very notion of Scotland,'' George Rosie, the writer
and host, said in introducing the program.
   Rosie presented impressive of evidence of ``non-Scot''
infiltration, the non-Scots being almost invariably from England.
   Non-Scots run most of Scotland's major state-subsidized arts
institutions: the National Museums, National Galleries, National
Library, Arts Council, Scottish Opera, Scottish Ballet, its three
major international arts festivals and the Scottish National Trust
for heritage parks and buildings.
   They run five of the eight universities, 10 of the 15
government-funded colleges and three of the six leading theaters.
   ``We are assimilating ourselves toward an English ideal and
gradually I think we will assimilate ourselves out of existence,''
Billy Kay, a playwright, historian and Scottish nationalist, said
on the program.
   Paul Scott, a retired diplomat, said: ``I think we're at very
grave risk of ceasing to exist as a recognizable nation, as a
recognizable culture and identity. The species is under threat.''
   While everyone saw a problem, there was little agreement on the
cause.
   Newspaper columnist Neal Ascherson said most of the institutions
mentioned were recent creations copied from England.
   ``The idea of cultural bureaucracies is entirely alien to
Scotland,'' he said. ``This is not a country which has
traditionally been kind to the arts.''
   Some said Scots were reluctant to protest ``Englishing'' for
fear of sounding racist. Alan Lawson, editor of the left-wing
journal ``Radical Scotland,'' said this fear had deprived Scots of
``the confidence to stand up and argue that there is a problem.''
   Allan Massie, a conservative writer, offered simple arithmetic:
``Because of the population ratio, if you have a job that is
publicly advertised and you have 10 applicants, you're quite likely
to find that seven of them come from outside Scotland.''
   Timothy Clifford, an Englishman who heads the National Gallery
of Scotland, called the program ``absolute arrant nonsense.''
   He said just as many Scots run English institutions, but Rosie
reported no Scots among 34 university heads in England and Wales,
and said only two of the 21 state-funded museums, art galleries and
libraries south of the border were run by Scots.
   Clifford argued that ``An Englishman sometimes understands more
and can better identify the Scottishness of something than a Scot
can.'' The program, too, paid tribute to the many non-Scots who
have fostered Scottish art forms the Scots themselves had neglected.
   Overall, however, Rosie's presentation painted a gloomy portrait
of a culture hijacked by outsiders. It inspired a deluge of
commentary and letters that complained of ``Englishing'' in
everything from soccer through architecture to the Englishisms
creeping into everyday speech in Scotland.
   The Advisory Council for the Arts in Scotland weighed in with
worry about ``the survival of Scotland as anything more than a
geographical expression.''
   Rosie said the letters ran 8-2 in support of his conclusions,
which are that ``certain jobs should be reserved for people who are
educated and brought up in Scotland and understand the nuances of
Scottish culture.''
   He acknowledges the impossibility of barring Englishmen from
jobs in Scotland since both are part of Britain, but added in an
interview: ``It's similarly daft that so many such jobs are being
taken by non-Scots. That's the ambivalence of our whole
constitutional situation.''
   The broadcast coincides with a broadly based campaign for
limited independence that is gathering support in Scotland.
   ``There does seem to be a fairly stronger feeling of nationalism
again,'' Rosie said. ``I think Scots have a pendulum consciousness
that swings from feeling British to feeling Scottish, and in my
opinion it's swinging toward Scottishness now.''

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito lost a large amount of blood early
today but was in stable condition after being given emergency blood
transfusions, palace officials said.
   Doctors gave the frail 87-year-old monarch a total of 1.3 pints
of blood overnight to compensate for the bleeding, the officials
said. It was the largest amount of blood the emperor has lost since
he discharged close to 2.1 pints from his bowels on Oct. 1, news
reports said.
   Iwao Miyao, vice grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency,
said there had been no new discharge as of this afternoon, but
doctors were ready to administer more blood at any time.
   Hirohito has been in serious condition since Sept. 19 when his
internal bleeding, thought to be coming from his upper intestine,
caused him to vomit a large amount of blood.
   Doctors believe the discharge this morning came from blood that
had accumulated over time from his internal hemorrhaging, palace
officials said.
   Palace spokesman Kenji Maeda told reporters the world's oldest
living monarch was ``in stable condition and fully conscious.''
   He said Hirohito had eaten small amounts of porridge during the
past four days, the first food he has had since Oct. 1. Doctors
have been concerned about the emperor's declining nutritional
status caused by his intraveneous feeding, which is unable to
provide enough nutrients.
   Today's transfusions brought the total amount of blood Hirohito
has received since his condition worsened to 19.8 pints, reportedly
about twice the total amount of blood in his body.
   The emperor underwent an intestinal bypass operation a year ago
after an enlarged pancreas put pressure on his intestine, blocking
the passage of food. Imperial Household officials said then he was
suffering from chronic pancreatitis and no signs of pancreatic
cancer were found.

   Gunmen wearing military-style uniforms
shot and stabbed six people to death in eastern Sri Lanka, an army
spokesman said today.
   The official, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said four Tamil and two Sinhalese men were shot and stabbed late
Monday in the village of Seyiliyamadu, about 175 miles east of
Colombo, the island's capital.
   The official said the slayings could have been done by either
militant Tamils fighting for a separate nation in the northeastern
province or extremist Sinhalese opposed to the government's peace
overtures to the Tamil rebels.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of the
island's 16 million people. Militant Tamils have been fighting
since 1983 for an independent homeland in the northeast.
   A peace accord aimed at ending the 5-year-old insurgency offered
Tamils limited automony in the region, and election of a provincial
council is scheduled for Nov. 19. In exchange, Tamil rebels must
surrender their weapons and end the fighting that has claimed at
least 8,500 lives.
   The most militant group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam,
accepted the agreement after it was signed by India and Sri Lanka
in July 1987. They reneged three months later, saying it did not
meet enough demands, and India sent an estimated 47,000 troops to
the island to put down the rebellion.
   Radicals in the Sinhalese community, which makes up 75 percent
of the island's population and controls the government, also oppose
the peace accord. They claim it grants too many concessions to the
Tamils.
   They have vowed to kill anyone who supports the agreement and
have been blamed for more than 500 deaths in the past year,
including members of the governing United National Party.

   The Soviet Union set off a nuclear bomb at an
underground test site to research the physics involved in a nuclear
explosion, the official Tass news agency said today.
   ``The radiation situation inside and outside the test area is
normal,'' Tass said.
   The test using a 20-kiloton bomb was a small one by current
standards that limit tests to 150 kilotons. It occurred this
morning at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazazkstan in Soviet
Central Asia.
   Just five weeks ago, the Soviets conducted a test at that site
of more than 100 kilotons. That explosion was monitored by American
experts as part of an experiment to calibrate remote sensors for
verification of compliance with treaties.

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen today
while share prices, affected by reports of Emperor Hirohito's
worsened condition, fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 27.83 points
Monday, shed 126.76 points today, or 0.46 percent, to close at
27,141.98. The index lost 28.41 points in its early trading and
continued falling at a slower pace. Monday's closing Nikkei was

   News that the emperor received an emergency blood transfusion
today caused many buyers to wait on the sidelines, traders said.
   ``Obviously, it's because of the emperor's ... blood
transfusion,'' said an analyst with Nomura Securities, Japan's
largest brokerage, speaking anonymously.
   ``Participants were less motivated in investing, which resulted
in thin trading,'' he said, adding the news affected the Tokyo
market more than any economic factor. Volume traded on the first

   Emperor Hirohito, 87, received the transfusion after he passed a
large amount of blood overnight and Monday morning. The world's
longest-reigning living monarch has been bedridden since Sept. 19
when he vomited blood from internal hemorrhaging.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 127.70 yen,
up 0.50 yen from Monday's close of 127.20 yen. Opening at 127.55
yen, the currency moved slightly higher and ranged between 127.20
and 128.00 yen.
   The dollar recovered slightly when some investors bought the
currency ``in fear of the cental bank's intervention near the
126-yen level,'' said a dealer with Mitsubishi Bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Most of the market players believed the Bank of Japan would
buy dollars if the rate kept falling,'' he said, adding
participants became more certain after the Bank of Japan inquired
about the dollar-yen rate Monday, which they took to mean the bank
was considering intervening.
   ``Some speculative investors also bought the dollar, and the
dollar-selling trend on the whole was still strong,'' the dealer
said.
   News reports said Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita
indicated this morning the central banks of major industrial
countires may carrry out concerted intervention to support the
dollar if it continues to decline sharply against the yen.

<HEAD>Indicted Congressman Likely To Go On Trial For Perjury Monday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall, likely heading to trial
next week on federal perjury charges, said he will resign from
office if he is convicted but expressed confidence he would be
exonerated.
   A federal grand jury on Monday indicted the two-term Republican
on 10 counts of perjury, saying he lied during a money laundering
investigation. He pleaded innocent and was freed on his
recognizance.
   Swindall, who will represent himself, moved quickly to schedule
his trial next week so the case could be resolved before the Nov. 8
election.
   U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining said he would reschedule
another trial to hear the Swindall case Monday if the congressman
filed the appropriate motion.
   Swindall is seeking his third term representing a suburban
Atlanta district, and he vowed to clear himself before the election.
   But he said he would resign if convicted ``because under the
circumstances, I don't think it would be fair to the voters of the
4th District'' to remain in office.
   His Democratic opponent, former ``Dukes of Hazzard'' television
actor Ben Jones, said, ``I feel concern for the congressman and for
his family at this point. ... It is a matter for the courts to
decide.''
   The indictment accused Swindall of lying to the grand jury Feb.
2 during its investigation of a proposed $850,000 home mortgage
loan the congressman had discussed with businessman Charles
LeChasney and an undercover agent posing as a financier.
   LeChasney and four others have been charged with money
laundering.
   The indictment charged that Swindall lied when he told the panel
he did not go to authorities to report the loan negotiations
because, ``I never satisfied myself of anything with respect to
criminality.''
   It also said he lied when he said there had never been
discussions about trying to conceal the trail of the money, and
when he denied having been specifically informed by the undercover
agent that the source of the loan could be illicit drug money.
   If convicted, Swindall could be sentenced to five years in
prison and fined $10,000 on each count, U.S. Attorney Robert Barr
said.
   Swindall has acknowledged an error in judgment in dealing with
LeChasney, but denied criminal wrongdoing and characterized any
questionable statements to the jury as a memory lapse.
   The congressman, who is an attorney, decried what he claimed
were political overtones to the case.
   ``This is a political lunch, this is a political case, it will
be a political trial, it'll be a political exoneration,'' he said.
   Barr, also a Republican, said the case wasn't politically
motivated.
   Vining had been scheduled to hear the trial of LeChasney and
another defendant Monday, and his willingness to delay that case to
speed up Swindall's trial was criticized by LeChasney's attorney,
Paul Kish.
   Kish said he may consider ending negotiations on a plea
agreement under which LeChasney would cooperate with prosecutors.
   ``There was no hurry in this case when my client sat in the
Douglas County Jail for three weeks,'' the lawyer said. ``All of a
sudden, everyone's falling all over themselves to get a defendant
to trial, as long as it's a congressman of the same political party
as the U.S. attorney, especially right before an election.''
   Swindall, who defeated Jones in 1986, this year has made an
issue of Jones' arrest record, including a conviction for
assaulting his wife. Jones has said the incidents occurred during a
bout with alcoholism that ended in 1977.
   Jones, who starred as ``Cooter'' in the long-running series,
``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' once suggested that Swindall submit to
drug tests, insinuating the congressman's behavior was unstable.

   A tractor-trailer carrying 200 beehives ran
off a busy highway and flipped over, releasing up to 250,000
honeybees into rush-hour traffic, authorities said.
   The spill snarled traffic Monday afternoon as drivers nearing
the intersection of Interstates 75 and 285 northwest of Atlanta
were warned in radio newscasts to roll up windows to avoid being
stung.
   A thick cloud of bees swarmed over the highways as they were
unable to return to their demolished hives. Wooden cartons
containing the hives were strewn over a 250-yard stretch near the
accident on I-75.
   Private beekeepers were called in to coax the bees back into
what few intact hives remained.
   ``I was on my way home and heard this on the radio and went home
to suit up,'' Cherokee County beekeeper Mace McGill said as bees
crawled over his netted helmet.
   Most of the swarm had dissipated by late Monday and there were
no reports of serious sting injuries.
   The driver of the truck, Luke Pugh, was listed in stable
condition in a hospital for accident injuries and a passenger,
Crystal Bosley, was treated and released, officials said.
   ``We were on the ground and we started to run and we got the
bees in our hair but they didn't sting us,'' Ms. Bosley said.
   The bees were being shipped by West Virginia-based JimCo from
Dodgeville, Wis., to De Land, Fla., said JimCo dispatcher John
Holbrook in De Land. He said the truck contained about 250,000 bees
and 200 hives, and that JimCo trucks from Kentucky and Florida were
driving to the scene Monday night to retrieve what they could.
   State Agriculture Department spokesman Carlton Moore said the
owner of the bees, Horace Bell of De Land, also was headed to the
scene. Any bees not rounded up would be destroyed, Moore said.

<HEAD>Government Denies Dissident Permission To Visit United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has withdrawn permission for outspoken
dissident Fang Lizhi to visit the United States and accused him of
spreading falsehoods about Chinese leaders, Fang said today.
   Fang, an astrophysicist at the Beijing Observatory, denied the
accusations and said he was reapplying for permission.
   The Chinese Academy of Sciences gave Fang permission in May to
attend a symposium in Texas starting Dec. 12 and spend six months
at the Colorado Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics.
   But he told The Associated Press today that the academy had sent
him a letter reversing its decision.
   The letter said ``relevant leaders were dissatisfied'' with
comments Fang made during a recent trip to Australia and Hong Kong,
he said. He spent three weeks in Australia in August and September
on an academic visit and spent a week in Hong Kong on his way back.
   Fang's wife, Li Shuxian, said the letter also accused Fang of
spreading rumors and said he should have gotten academy approval
for the stop in Hong Kong.
   Fang said he wrote to the academy denying its accusations and
reapplying to go.
   ``Whether leaders are happy or not should not affect normal
scientific exchanges,'' Li quoted him as saying in the letter.
   Fang confirmed that in an informal meeting with Chinese students
in Australia he mentioned rumors that many Chinese leaders and
their children maintain foreign bank accounts.
   The official Chinese news agency Xinhua challenged Fang to
defend his comments when he arrived in Hong Kong.
   But Fang said the rumors are ``very common, even among the
students I talked to in Australia,'' and that he made no public
accusations against officials.
   He said all his comments abroad were permitted under the Chinese
constitution, and denied Hong Kong press reports that he derided
the Chinese government's four basic principles: socialism,
leadership by the Communist Party, the dictatorship of the
proletariat and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse-tung thought.
   However, Fang said he stands by his comments both in China and
abroad criticizing Marxism and one-party rule.
   ``Everything has a beginning and an end. Even the ideology of
the Communist Party says that it (the party) will come to an end,''
Fang said.
   Fang became famous in China in 1986 after supporting democracy
in speeches to students at the University of Science and Technology
in Hefei in central China. Authorities said his speeches helped
incite students in Hefei and at major cities nationwide to join
pro-democracy demonstrations that were suppressed in early 1987.
   Fang was expelled from the Communist Party shortly later and
forced to resign as vice president of the University of Science and
Technology.

<TEXT>
   A woman has been jailed for refusing
to testify against her husband in a family molestation
investigation a week after one of their daughters was ordered
jailed for not testifying.
   The 39-year-old woman was called to testify at a hearing Monday
against her husband, who is accused of molesting his two eldest
daughters, ages 16 and 18.
   ``No, I will not, your honor,'' she replied when asked by
Gwinnett County Superior Court Judge Bryant Huff if she planned to
answer his questions.
   Huff told her she could not invoke marital privilege, which
normally allows one spouse from testifying against the other. A
1987 amendment to the law prohibits couples from invoking the
privilege when a child is the victim of a crime and a parent is
accused, said prosecutor Donald Johstono.
   When the judge asked the woman if she understood the
consequences of not cooperating, she replied, ``I understand that
there is an abuse of power going on here.''
   Huff ordered the woman jailed on $100,000 bond.
   Last week, Huff ordered the couple's 18-year-old daughter to
jail for refusing to testify. She remained jailed Monday. The
16-year-old daughter has been allowed not testify because she is
emotionally unable to, authorities said.
   The couple, who has two other daughters and two sons, has
criticized authorities for prosecuting the case, saying officials
are trying to tear their family apart. The woman said her Mormon
faith, which is committed to maintaining the family unit, prevents
her from testifying.
   Her husband is charged with multiple counts of child
molestation, aggravated child molestation and sodomy, and one count
of aggravated sodomy. He is free on $25,000 bond.
   Defense attorney Cal Leipold has repeatedly objected to Huff's
attempts to compel testimony in the case.
   Huff has been attempting to take testimony to determine if
allegations made four years ago by the two daughters are admissible.

<HEAD>Leaders of Three Jewish Groups Disagree With Pro-Israel Lobby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of three mainstream Jewish groups have
charged Israel's chief lobbying organization in Washington is out
of step with ``the consensus of the organized Jewish community,'' a
newspaper reported today.
   The leaders of the three organizations made the charge in a
letter addressed to Edward C. Levy Jr., president of the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee, The New York Times said.
   The six signers of the letter, which was obtained by the
newspaper, are top officials of the American Jewish Committee, the
American Jewish Congress and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith.
   The letter, according to the Times, said Aipac did not represent
``the consensus of the organized Jewish community'' on important
Middle East issues.
   The six said they disagreed with Aipac's opposition to arms
sales to Kuwait; its efforts to shut down the Palestine Liberation
Organization's United Nations mission; and its effort to deny PLO
leader Yasser Arafat a visa to address the United Nations, the
newspaper reported.
   The letter says that the three organizations have established,
``a joint political committee for Israel in Washington'' to arrange
for the presentation of their testimony before congressional
committees and government agencies, the Times said.
   Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the ADL, said late
Monday, ``I think the letter is a desire on our part to better the
relationship between Aipac and the three agencies. The working
relationship with Aipac is good but we want it to be somewhat
better.''
   He noted that the three organizations, which have headquarters
in New York, already maintain offices in Washington so it was not
as if they were ``setting up anything new.'' It is not their
intention, he added, ``to set up as a competing group or to
duplicate what'' Aipac does.
   The three groups already are represented on Aipac's executive
committee, a policy-making body of about 150 people that meets four
times a year.
   A senior Aipac officer quoted anonymously told the Times: ``More
consultation is always desirable, but the establishment of a second
lobbying entity would undermine the effectiveness of the pro-Israel
community in presenting its case to public officials in Washington
and elsewhere.''

   This community was in shock over
the suicides of two 15-year-old boys who police said shared a
hunting rifle to kill themselves out of despondency at being
separated when one of their families moved away.
   South Milwaukee High School Principal Norman S. Klein tried to
prepare teachers and staff members to deal with student suicide
threats and attempts, staging a ``simulation suicide exercise'' two
weeks ago to rehearse a proper response.
   ``Even though we were prepared, it was a shock,'' said Klein,
53, a principal 12 years.
   The bodies of Michael J. Kruczkowski of South Milwaukee and
William A. Bollis, who recently moved with his family 70 miles
north to Malone, were found by Kruczkowski's mother in the attic of
their home Sunday evening.
   ``They were best of friends and they had been separated,''
Police Chief Erick A. Slamka said. ``The kid from up north had come
down to visit for the weekend, and it was when the father came to
pick him up that the bodies were discovered.''
   Evidence showed both boys died from a single shot to the head,
and the wounds appeared to be self-inflicted, Slamka said.
Kruczkowski shot himself first, police said.
   According to the medical examiner's report, the boys left two
printed notes addressed to their parents.
   One note said they decided to end their lives because they could
no longer be separated from their friends and each other, the
report said. The second note instructed the parents to listen to a
tape recording that explained the decision, it said.
   Police declined to release the words of the notes or tape, which
Slamka said ran no more than a minute.
   ``This wasn't spontaneous,'' Slamka said. ``It was planned,
though I'm not sure how long it was pre-planned.''
   The bodies were discovered after Bollis' father came to the home
and met Kruczkowski's mother. She went to the attic of the
wood-frame house, where her son lived with his father, and found
the bodies, Slamka said. Kruczkowski's parents are divorced.
   The .30-06-caliber rifle was owned by the Kruczkowski's father,
who also had other rifles in the home.
   There was no evidence that the boys had used drugs or alcohol,
the chief said. ``In fact, I'm not aware of any problems with the
two of them.''
   Slamka said he could not recall another case of a multiple
suicide in his 25 years on the force.
   ``From time to time we have gunshot suicides and young people
are involved,'' he said. ``Each time it's especially tragic, and in
the event of a double suicide, it multiplies the loss and the
concern you have for these people.''
   Early Monday, Slamka sent his school liaison officer to the high
school to meet with the principal. The deaths were announced over
the public address system and students were told counselors were
available to help them.
   Similar steps were taken at New Holstein High School in Calumet
County, about 70 miles north of Milwaukee, where Bollis was a
student, officials said.
   Tim Schwaller, a social worker for the South Milwaukee School
District, said the guidance counselor office was ``hopping all
morning'' with students wishing to talk about the deaths. Teachers
were told about the shootings and were urged to be open with
students should they ask what happened, he said.
   Klein also had to inform students Monday of the death of a math
teacher, Dale Parkinson, 44, from a heart attack Saturday.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Kruczkowski on Wednesday
evening and for Bollis on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Three escaped detainees
encamped in the U.S. Consulate for more than a month plan to leave
their sanctuary Wednesday, an anti-apartheid labor federation said
today.
   The three prominent activists, who escaped detention Sept. 13,
have been living in the consulate on the 11th floor of a downtown
Johannesburg office building.
   The South African government has said the trio is free to leave
and it will not redetain or restrict the men in any way.
   The decision for the men to leave ``is a major test of the
government's undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on
the detention and persecution of anti-apartheid activists,'' the
Congress of South African Trade Unions said in a staement.
   The congress is the country's largest black labor organization
and is a militant opponent of apartheid.
   The anti-apartheid leaders are Murphy Morobe and Mohanned Valli
Moosa, leaders of the banned United Democratic Front coalition, and
Vusi Khanyile, chairman of the banned National Education Crisis
Committee.
   Morobe and Khanyile are black, Valli Moosa is of Indian descent.
   All had been held more than a year without charge when they
slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a
Johannesburg hospital.
   ``The three have called the state's bluff and intend to leave,''
the congress statement said.
   ``We do not for a moment believe that the government intended
releasing them and that they somehow pre-empted this by their
escape,'' it added. ``This government line was meant to appease the
U.S. administration and dilute public and international concern
over detentions.''
   U.S. officials have said they would not force the three to leave
despite a worldwide U.S. policy of not allowing diplomatic offices
to be used by those seeking asylum.
   U.S. officials have maintained a low profile during the episode
and U.S. Embassy spokesman William Zavis said he had no immediate
comment on the matter.
   Earlier the activists had said they do not trust the government
and repeated their call for the release of other political
detainees.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without trial for
varying lengths of time under the 28-month-old state of emergency.
About 1,000 people currently are believed to be in detention. Most
are being held for political activism.
   An activist who escaped Sept. 21 to the U.S. Consulate, Clifford
Ngcobo, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment, his
law firm said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vana LaCost says her customers can get
the great pumpkin _ but they'll have to shop early. Drought has
reduced the number of jumbo jack-o'lanterns in her eight-acre patch
as in other areas of the Midwest.
   ``The decorative pumpkin crop is short and people (in the
Midwest) will be paying more than usual for large pumpkins,'' said
J. M. Gerber, a pumpkin specialist at the University of Illinois.
``The problem area is as wide as the drought.''
   Pumpkin growers in the East have a good crop, but shipping them
to the Midwest is expensive and adds to the price, Gerber said.
   Decorative pumpkins are grown on smaller plots, usually near
urban areas. And because farmers often cannot afford to irrigate,
the drought can cause significant damage.
   This year, seed failed to germinate in the sun-baked Midwestern
soil, and vines that did grow either failed to produce as many
pumpkins, or produced smaller fruit than in previous years.
   Gerber said many growers in the Midwest realized their crop
would be smaller when the vines started dying and uncovering the
fruit.
   ``It will be the late shopper who has problems. The last week
before Halloween could be tight,'' Mrs. LaCost, whose farm is near
Kankakee, predicted Monday.
   She said she has kept pace with demand so far and the quality of
her pumpkins is good, but the drought cut her volume in half. She
would not specify her prices, but said they are a little higher
than last year.
   Consumers won't have to worry about a shortage of canned
pumpkins for holiday pies, say officials in Illinois, which leads
the country with about 5,000 acres of the commercially canned
product.
   ``We had a super year,'' said Jack Rohrs, plant manager for the
Libby division of Carnation Co.
   Libby processes about 100,000 tons of pumpkins a year at its
Morton plant. Rohrs said the size of the pumpkins was smaller than
usual, but the amount of fruit available was excellent.
   He said Libby's variety was deep-rooted and survived the summer
drought well. However, about 40 percent of Libby's growers use
irrigation.
   ``Our pumpkins were the best they ever were,'' said Lewis
Friedrich, a Tazewell County farmer who raises 180 acres of
pumpkins for Libby on irrigated land. He said his yields ranged
from 33 tons per acre to nearly 41 tons per acre, and Libby paid
$17 a ton for the crop.

   The chairman of a group that wants English to be
the nation's official language says he resigned to let voters focus
on the issue instead of on allegations about his ties to advocates
of forced sterilization.
   The controversy has ``come to center more around me in the last
week or 10 days,'' John Tanton said Monday. He said his resignation
from U.S. English, which he co-founded, would give him time to
fight accusations.
   His decision followed announcements by former White House aide
Linda Chavez and retired CBS newsman Walter Cronkite that they were
severing their ties with the organization.
   Ms. Chavez said Monday she was quitting because she had been
told that some major contributors to Tanton's other interests
advocated unusual views on population and immigration control,
including advocacy of forced sterilization.
   ``To me it is just not consistent with the views I hold,'' she
said.
   Cronkite resigned from the advisory board to U.S. English on
Oct. 6 after learning of a 2-year-old Tanton memo.
   That memo, distributed at a 1986 immigration conference, posed a
series of questions and depicted an America possibly doomed to
conflict between a minority of educated well-off English speakers
and a majority of uneducated poor people of other ethnic and racial
groups with faster population growth.
   Tanton on Monday described the memo as ``a compilation of
questions and views of many observers on complex and controversial
issues.''
   ``Our opponents have falsely charged that it reflects the views
of myself or U.S. English and its positions on these initiatives,''
he added. ``There is no connection between a memo I wrote in 1986
and the initiatives for the ballot in November 1988.''
   U.S. English backs measures in Arizona, Colorado and Florida
next month.
   Arizona's Proposition 106, if approved, would change the state
constitution to designate English as the state's official language
and limit government use of foreign languages in courts, meetings
and schools.
   Ms. Chavez said at least one major contributor to U.S. English
helped reprint ``an awful, awful book'' called ``Camp of the
Saints,'' which she described as ``a paranoid fantasy'' about
``undesirables of the Third World'' taking over developed nations.
   She said she had been told that Tanton's activities with
immigration and population-control groups involved some who may
have given money to ``groups that may be involved in eugenics
research.''
   She said one person favored forced sterilization but she did not
elaborate.
   Tanton said he did not know who the people Chavez was talking
about.
   U.S. English gets most of its funds from U.S. Inc., a Michigan
corporation run by Tanton, Tanton's wife and two Michigan men.
Records show U.S. Inc. gets most of its funds from direct-mail
solicitation but do not identify the contributors.
   ``We have never had any sort of a litmus test when somebody has
wanted to contribute,'' Tanton said in an interview, adding that
U.S. Inc. had 168,000 donors this year and 379,000 since it was
founded.
   He said he would continue to head U.S. Inc. as an ``incubator
for new ideas,'' and that U.S. English had been given mailing lists
and would be able to operate independently.
   Supporters of Proposition 106 say it would unify the state and
help minorities join the mainstream more quickly. Critics say it
would disrupt the operation of civil courts, English-proficiency
classes, and tourism and commerce with other countries.
   U.S. English, through its campaign-finance arm, has contributed
$160,603, or about 97 percent of total contributions in support of
Prop 106, according to the latest available records.
   Bill Meek, a spokesman for the Arizona opponents of Prop 106,
said he viewed the Tanton resignation as ``largely cosmetic''
because Tanton retained control of U.S. Inc. and because he was
being replaced as chairman of U.S. English by board member Stanley
Diamond of San Francisco, ``one of his strongest supporters.''
   U.S. English was founded in 1983 by Tanton and former Sen. S.I.
Hayakawa, R-Calif.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Race Through Ohio Valley and Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Storms swept into the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes today after
spawning a tornado that overturned a trailer in Indiana and
lightning that struck five people in Chicago and delayed hundreds
of flights at O'Hare International Airport.
   Thunderstorms developing ahead of a cold front produced severe
weather in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky on Monday evening.
   In Indiana, a tornado touched down in Vermillion County,
overturning a trailer and injuring a husband and wife inside. The
tornado also blew down a barn.
   Thunderstorms on Monday produced golf-ball-sized hail at Colfax
and Le Roy, Ill. Elsewhere in Illinois, five people were struck by
lightning during a storm that delayed more than 200 flights at
Chicago's O'Hare and dumped more than 3 inches of rain. There were
no reports of serious injuries.
   But in San Francisco, beaches were crowded Monday during a
heatwave that pushed the mercury to 92 degrees for a second
record-breaking day.
   Early today, showers and thunderstorms extended from southern
Illinois and western Kentucky through the upper Ohio Valley and the
lower Great Lakes region into Ontario.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms moving
from eastern portions of the upper Great Lakes and lower Ohio
Valley across the northern and and central Appalachians to New
England; cloudy with rainshowers scattered over parts of the
Northwest; and cloudy to partly cloudy over the northern Plains and
upper Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 40s for the upper
Mississippi Valley and northern parts of the upper Great Lakes; the
50s for Maine and Washington state, from the northern Plains and
Nebraska across Iowa and northern Illinois to the Ohio Valley and
southern parts of the upper Great Lakes; the 80s from the southern
two-thirds of Texas across the Gulf Coast to Florida, southern
Georgia and the eastern Carolinas. Temperatures in the 80s were
also expected for the southern half of the southern Rockies and
much of Arizona and California; in the 90s over the desert
Southwest and California's inland valleys; in the 60s and 70s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 26
degrees at Hibbing, Minn., to 79 at Phoenix.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 60 fair; Boston 55 drizzle; Buffalo 61 rain;

   The dollar rose in calm European trading today.
Gold prices also firmed.
   Foreign currency dealers predicted the dollar would trade within
a tight range for the next several days.
   They said the market was unlikely to test the currency's lower
limits following reported remarks by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi
Sumita. He was quoted in Tokyo as indicating central banks of major
industrial countries may carrry out concerted intervention to
support the dollar if it continued to decline sharply against the
yen.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.50 yen to close at 127.70 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 127.25 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.8138 West German marks, up from 1.8120
   _ 1.5335 Swiss francs, up from 1.5295
   _ 6.1890 French francs, up from 6.1790
   _ 2.0485 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0390
   _ 1,351.50 Italian lire, up from 1,348.50
   _ 1.2030 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2047
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7450, down from late
Monday's $1.7530.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $412.60 a troy ounce, up
from $412.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.05.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $412.50, up from $412.30 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.99 to close at a bid $416.05.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.44 a troy
ounce, little changed from Monday's $6.43.

<HEAD>Investigators Expect More Money Laundering Indictments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are looking into the
affairs of 40 banks across the country and expect to turn up ``a
couple'' more that have engaged in money laundering for drug
dealers, Customs Commissioner William Von Raab said today.
   ``It's just amazing what happens when you turn over a rock as
big as this,'' Von Raab said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   ``We've got our agents in 40 banks around the country, as well
as this bank in Miami. There are British agents in London, French
agents in Paris, and there's just voluminous material, all of which
is more or less bearing out what we expected to find,'' he said.
   ``We expect to see a lot of indictments coming out of this,'' he
said.
   The indictment last week of a bank holding company has not
halted such money handling, Von Raab said. ``We're looking at as
much as $50 billion a year that is laundered overseas. So this
bank, at best, could have laundered only a hundredth of that.''
   ``We haven't put a stop to it yet,'' he said. But the indictment
of the Florida-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International is
``a very important part of a cure.''
   ``No doubt there are other banks like this,'' Von Raab went on.
``There is $50 billion that someone has to launder, one bank can't
do the job. As to whether there are other banks that know they're
doing this and are doing it intentionally, I really can't give you
that answer.
   ``We've got a lot of investigations; we'll probably turn up a
couple.''
   The charge in this case is that the bank knew what it was doing,
that it knew it was dealing with drug money and that it was
intentionally laundering the proceeds, he explained.
   Why would a bank do that, he was asked.
   ``Banks want the money,'' he observed.
   Altogether, 85 defendants have been indicted in the
investigation. Indictments were returned in Tampa, Fla.; New York;
Chicago; Detroit; Philadelphia, and Houston. In addition, arrest
warrants were issued in Miami, Los Angeles, London and Paris in the
case involving the laundering of money for the powerful Colombian
drug cartel.
   Money laundering is the process of transferring money obtained
illegally between businesses or banks in order to obscure its
origin and to make it appear to have been earned in a legal manner.

   When the gray-haired, aristocratic Texan stood
before the black political activists in the California state
capitol, they could not have been prepared for what followed.
   Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, was
funny.
   ``I'm one of only two folks in this crowd who knows where
Mineola, Texas is,'' he said, referring to the native town of
California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who had given him a warm
introduction at the session last week. ``Willie is one of my few
friends who has an office larger than his home town.''
   He joked about the flashy Brown's penchant for Ferraris and fast
driving. Then, in another joke, he neatly summed up his predicament.
   ``Willie Brown think's I'm a little ... (pause) ... dull,'' he
said. ``The problem I've got with Mike Dukakis _ he thinks I'm too
flamboyant.''
   ``That's the way it is when you're running for vice president,''
he said.
   The Texas Democrat, at age 67, seems to have found stride. Even
as the Democratic campaign appears to sink, he campaigns with
increasing confidence and humor.
   In the nearly two weeks since he bested Republican Dan Quayle in
their debate, Bentsen has acquired a smoother delivery and, it
seems, new respect from the electorate. Everywhere he goes, people
ask him: How would he like to be the head of the ticket.
   Bentsen, who once failed miserably in seeking the presidency
himself 12 years ago, now just chuckles.
   ``We've got a very able man at the head of that ticket and I'm
delighted to be on it with him,'' he said in an interview Monday.
``He's tough, he's intelligent, he has complete integrity and he's
a proven product with the fine job he's done in the state of
Massachusetts.''
   If Bentsen has any doubts about Dukakis, he keeps them under
wraps. But he has learned the frustration of being the second half
of a presidential ticket. He sees it every day in the polls _ polls
that show his own popularity superb but the Democrats losing his
native Texas by a double-digit margin.
   Bentsen stubbornly insists he and Dukakis will manage to carry
the Lone Star state.
   ``Texas is still a major priority, I'm going to spend a great
deal of time down there. Michael Dukakis is scheduled back into
Texas. It stays a high priority,'' he said.
   But in Texas and elsewhere, Bentsen is like a .300 hitter on a
team with a pitcher who can't throw strikes. As his career winds
down, political fans speak well of his candidacy, but he can't
bring home the pennant.
   Dukakis often points to Bentsen as an example of his leadership,
comparing his choice to Bush's selection of Dan Quayle. But
Bentsen's campaign schedule, concocted by the governor's aides in
Massachusetts, seems like an afterthought, with many
hastily-thrown-together and poorly executed events.
   Last Friday, he spent nine hours in the air so he could
introduce Dukakis at a rally in Sacramento.
   He saw the biggest crowds of the campaign when he rode in a
parade at a Navajo reservation in northwest New Mexico. Tens of
thousands of people lined the route near Shiprock, but reporters
walking alongside him heard the same question all along the route
``Who is he?'' The campaign had neglected to hand out leaflets to
the crowd before he came.
   Last Saturday night, Bentsen visited an ethnic area of Brooklyn
and spoke to supporters, mostly Greek fans of Dukakis, in a church
hall. Even his own staff was puzzled by the stop.
   ``Out of those 600 people, there were probably two undecideds,''
quipped one top aide.
   Bentsen himself refrains from criticizing Dukakis directly. He
has grumbled about the governor being too slow to respond to the
attacks from the Bush campaign, and hints he would have answered
key questions in the last Dukakis-Bush debate differently.
   ``I'm not going to try to second guess him,'' he said,
emphasizing that the campaign had to focus on the three weeks ahead.
   He won't say what advice he's given Dukakis, only that some has
been taken and some has been rejected. Clearly, his stance is an
aggressive one.
   ``Down in my country, politics is a contact sport,'' he's fond
of saying.
   But as Bentsen was leaving that black political meeting in the
statehouse in Sacramento, he was almost wistful as he wished them
well and bid them adieu.
   ``I'm going back on the road,'' he told Willie Brown. ``And I'll
write if I find work.''

<TEXT>
   Laborers working round-the-clock today
finished piecing together a statue of Gen. Douglas MacArthur four
days after vandals blasted it with dynamite.
   World War II veterans have arrived in this coastal village on
Leyte island for a ceremony Thursday marking the day when the
American general led U.S. troops in liberating the Philippines from
Japan on Oct. 20, 1944.
   The Americans landed on Leyte, about 300 miles southeast of
Manila. The island is among the poorest in the Philippines, and
communist guerrillas have been active in the region for years.
   Police said today they believe the blast may have been the work
of vandals under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. But they
added that they were not ruling out communist rebels as suspects.
   Damage was so extensive that the reconstructed concrete figure
of the general has an disproportionately large left shoulder,
giving it the appearance of tipping over. The quick repair job also
eliminated the imperial air of the late American four-star general
depicted by the original sculpture.
   Workers reinforced the steel frame of the 10-foot statue to
minimize damage in case of a second attack.
   The statue shows MacArthur, flanked by Filipinos and American
soldiers, wading ashore on Leyte.
   ``I think (the vandalism was) immoral,'' said Alfredo
Mescallado, 75, a naturalized American of Filipino descent. ``Maybe
(the vandals) didn't know that MacArthur liberated the Philippines
... They don't know their history.''
   Mescallado, a doctor from New York City, served under MacArthur
during World War II.
   Sandy Valerio, 64, an Italian-born American from New York, said
communist New People's Army guerrillas may have attacked the statue
to protest the American military presence in the Philippines.
   ``I don't feel anything bad about (the blasting),'' Valerio
added. ``Everybody has his own ideology.''
   Dozens of former Japanese soldiers visited the site today, most
of them posing for photographs in front of MacArthur's statue.

   Firefighters battling blazes that charred
nearly 6,000 acres of brush said they were confident the flames
would not burn a shelter for exotic animals or burn the area around
giant trees in Sequoia National Park.
   Barring sudden gusts, the 3,300-acre fire northwest of Los
Angeles did not present a threat to the Wildlife Way Station or a
home for 125 emotionally disturbed children, said U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman Kim Vanderhaar.
   The flames were 1{ miles away from the animal shelter and about
3 miles beyond the home for children in Little Tujunga Canyon, she
said.
   Officials at the wild animal shelter were cautious but confident.
   ``All the animals are confined, because we can't guard a
free-roaming animal very well,'' said Martine Colette, spokeswoman
for the animal shelter about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles.
   The shelter houses alligators, tigers, bears, horses, giraffes
and a variety of other abandoned exotic pets and wild animals that
wandered into neighborhoods.
   The fire in the Angeles National Forest, which was 30 percent
contained as of early today, forced evacuations of seven homes.
   Two firefighters suffered minor injuries while battling the
blaze, which officials estimated will be surrounded at 6 p.m.
Wednesday and extinguished 24 hours later.
   More than 800 firefighters were aided by nine air tankers and
three helicopters that began dropping water and fire-retardant
chemicals at dawn Monday as the blaze burned dry brush in
inaccessible mountainous terrain.
   Three Los Angeles men were booked on $2,500 bail for
investigation of starting a forest fire with an illegal campfire,
but they were released Monday and no charges were to be filed, said
Deputy Hal Grant of the Sheriff's Information Bureau.
   ``It appears a 10-year-old boy has admitted to it,'' Grant said.
``He told arson investigators he started a campfire that got out of
control.''
   The fire was one of several _ including a 1,500-acre fire near
trees up to 2,700 years old in Sequoia National Park _ that erupted
during the weekend as an autumn heat wave blasted California with
temperatures near 100 degrees in some areas and sent dry desert
winds gusting to 30 mph.
   In Sequoia, 600 firefighters worked to make sure the fires kept
away from the 3-square-mile Giant Forest, a grove of trees
considered the largest living things on Earth, said Forest Service
spokeswoman Michele Case. The fire was burning away from the trees
as of today, she said.
   The trees can generally survive forest fires because their soft
bark can withstand considerable heat and flame, although ``a
sequoia tree is fire-resistant, not fireproof,'' Case said.
   Elsewhere in California, other blazes consumed about 1,300 acres
of brush.

   World Jewish Congress President Edgar M. Bronfman
today indicated Communist East Germany will pay reparations to
Holocaust victims and their families.
   He also said he hoped for improved contacts between East Germany
and Israel. The two countries never have had diplomatic relations.
   ``I have been given the understanding that serious consideration
is being given to some renewal of relationship between the two
countries and I hope that will happen in the not-too-distant
future,'' Bronfman said.
   Before his meeting Tuesday with East German leader Erich
Honecker, Bronfman said he expected his three-day visit to East
Berlin would lead to a reparations agreement for Jewish victims.
East Germany had said it would provide unspecified humanitarian aid
to Holocaust victims.
   At a news conference in East Berlin at the end of his trip,
Bronfman declined to be specific on exactly what compensation he
expects.
   ``I have had very good, clear meetings here,'' Bronfman said.
   ``I am totally satisfied on two counts. The first is the one
that concerns me the most. That is the moral position that East
Germany is taking on its responsibilities on the Holocaust. The
second point is payment to the sufferers and survivors.''
   Bronfman also referred to an international claims conference
backed by the World Jewish Congress that has handled reparations
issues for Holocaust victims.
   ``I understand that the negotiations that took place between the
government and claims conference have been completed,'' he said.
``They will be lived up to and the details and communications will
be worked out and reported.''
   ``I am completely satisifed with the results,'' Bronfman added.
``I have nothing further to say on the payments question. It is not
my responsibility to discuss the details.''
   Toward the end of the news conference, a reporter called out a
question about West German Jewish leaders' statements that East
Germany would pay up to $100 million to Holocaust victims.
   ``The 100 million was not part of my mission,'' Bronfman
responded.
   There was no immediate statement on the reparations issue from
the official East German news agency ADN. The news agency has been
providing extensive coverage of Bronfman's visit.
   ADN said Monday the talks were ``open and constructive'' and
added that Honecker told Bronfman of East Germany's efforts to
educate its young people about the Holocaust.
   ``The struggle against racism and anti-Semitism belongs to the
anti-fascist tradition of East Germany,'' Honecker said Monday.
   ``We will never forget that many Jews, together with communists
and Social Democrats ... were active in the struggle against the
Nazi dictatorship,'' Honecker said, according to ADN.
   Bronfman has said that an admission of shared responsibility for
the Holocaust was as important as financial contributions to
victims, and that the money was a ``token thing.''
   ``What is at stake here is moral culpability,'' he said.
   More than 6 million Jews were killed during Adolf Hitler's Third
Reich. However, East Germany has argued that it bears no
reponsibility for Nazi atrocities because the nation was created
after World War II ended.
   In 1952, West Germany signed an agreement with the World Jewish
Congress to compensate Holocaust victims and families. Since then,
West Germany has paid more than $48 billion to Holocaust survivors.

<HEAD>Ford Estate Settlement Falls Through; Heirs May Fight It Out At
Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last-minute objections scuttled a
proposed settlement on how to distribute Henry Ford II's $350
million estate, meaning heirs may have to go to trial.
   The settlement had appeared a certainty when opposing parties
arrived at Palm Beach County Circuit Court on Monday.
   But attorneys for Ford's grandchildren, who won't benefit from
the trust until after the death of Ford's 48-year-old widow, raised
objections.
   ``I've heard enough,'' Judge Vaughn Rudnick said after listening
to several of the more than a dozen attorneys unravel the deal. ``I
cannot approve an agreement at this date.''
   Unless a new agreement is reached, there will have to be more
hearings and possibly a trial that the privacy-conscious family has
been trying to avoid.
   ``We're back to square A,'' said Robert Montgomery, one of four
attorneys representing the widow, Kathleen DuRoss Ford. She is to
receive at least $1.5 million a year under the terms of her
husband's vast trust, which is at the center of the squabbling.
   Only minutes before the settlement breakdown, Montgomery had
been holding an impromptu news conference in which he said the
bitter disagreements aired in the court file and at a hearing in
August had been resolved.
   Everyone is happy now, everyone has signed the settlement
agreement, attirbetls said. By settling, the workings of the trust
could once again become a private matter, as Henry Ford II had
wished it would be.
   Ford died at age 70 on Sept. 29, 1987, in Detroit. He filed his
will, which contained little information, in Palm Beach County,
which was his legal residence.
   The attorneys would reveal little of the settlement agreement
beyond saying that Mrs. Ford, Ford's third wife, would withdraw her
objections to investor William Donaldson's becoming a trustee.
   The dispute erupted when Mrs. Ford objected to the selection of
Donaldson, a former undersecretary of state, as a trustee to help
manage the vast estate. She had argued that his proposed $1 million
a year fee for management expertise was excessive. Attorneys would
not say how much he would be paid if the settlement is approved.

   The president today warned of
``great danger'' for the country if Communist Party leaders do not
stop arguing over ethnic and social unrest that have stirred up
Yugoslavia's worst postwar crisis.
   Leaders from the country's two largest republics, Serbia and
Croatia, clashed openly as the party's 162-member Central Committee
met today for a second day to discuss personnel and policy changes.
   ``The way out of the crisis is not in extraordinary measures but
in a change of behavior,'' President Raif Dizdarevic told the
session, referring to unspecified actions he threatened to take
last week if workers continued to stage mass rallies fueled by
economic and ethnic problems.
   ``The lack of unity in the leadership, multiplying of late, is a
great danger for the country,'' he added. ``Yugoslavia is
front-page news all around the world, unfortunately in a negative
way.''
   Dizdarevic spoke to the country's top leaders, including
Communist Party chief Stipe Suvar, who planned to end the Central
Committee session today with a vote of confidence in 10 members of
the 23-member ruling Politburo.
   Josip Vrhovec, one of nine members of Yugoslavia's federal
presidency, attacked Serbian party chief Slobodan Milosevic, whose
supporters have dominated the rallies.
   Using a statement Milosevic allegedly made to an Austrian
weekly, Vrhovec _ who is from the republic of Croatia _ demanded
that Milosevic use his influence to stop the denunciations of
Communist Party leaders in the media and at the protests.
   Milosevic countered that he had never made the statement or
given any interview to foreign media. Vrhovec apologized.
   Kosovo's Communist Party leader, Katjusa Jasari, told the
meeting the only way to solve the problems of her backward southern
province was for the ethnic Albanian majority to unite with the
Slav minority in confronting economic problems. The Slavs claim
they are harassed by the ethnic Albanians.
   During Monday's session, Suvar backed a market-oriented economic
reform program being considered by Parliament to fight the 217
percent annual inflation rate and $21 billion foreign debt.
   Milosevic on Monday launched an impassioned defense of the mass
rallies that have fanned ethnic unrest and party disunity.
   Marko Orlandic, the party chief of the southern republic of
Montenegro, said 10 members of the Politburo are expected to face
today's vote of confidence, including party chief Suvar. Orlandic
said the 10 will need at least two-thirds of the Central Committee
votes to retain their seats on the ruling body.
   The confidence vote will be conducted by secret ballot, he said.
   It will not apply to the four Presidium members who announced
prior to the current Central Committee that they would resign, he
said.
   It also does not apply to nine members of the 23-man ruling body
who hold their seats as party leaders of Yugoslavia'a six republics
and two provinces, and the armed forces.
   Milosevic, who has antagonized non-Serbs, is among those exempt
from the vote of confidence.
   Milosevic is trying to extend Serbian control over his
republic's two autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo.
   But Milosevic insisted Monday that ``Serbia has no claims to the
territory of other republics. It does have claim to territory in
its own republic.''
   Milosevic's drive has brought him into unprecedented open
conflict with Suvar and the Communist Party chief of the northern
republic of Slovenia, Milan Kucan. The three men are Yugoslavia's
most important communist leaders.
   On Monday, Kucan lent unreserved support to Suvar's appeal for
unity and economic reform to ease social tensions.
   The economic reform program has been worked out by the
government under Premier Branko Mikulic, who survived a vote of
confidence in May but came under severe criticism Monday for
failing to control the economic crisis.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses $1 Billion Lawsuit In 1984 Bhopal Accident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state judge dismissed a lawsuit against
Union Carbide that sought $1 billion in damages for victims of the
1984 toxic gas leak in Bhopal, India, that killed more than 2,000
people.
   State District Judge Gary Sanderson's one-page ruling Monday
said only that it was his opinion that a motion to dismiss the
lawsuit should be granted. Sanderson had heard arguments to dismiss
the lawsuit from Union Carbide on Sept. 28.
   Houston attorney Benton Musslewhite, who filed the lawsuit in
1985 and later amended it to include almost 2,000 plaintiffs, said
he plans to appeal and he also will ask Sanderson for more detail
on his reasoning for rejecting the suit.
   ``The only place these poor people can get justice is in
Beaumont, Texas,'' Musslewhite said.
   The lawsuit claimed that a Texas statute allows lawsuits over
incidents that happened in foreign countries to be filed in state
district courts.
   Attorney John Bissell, who represented Union Carbide in the
case, had argued that the case clearly should be tried in India.
   ``The accident happened in India; it was an Indian subsidiary of
Union Carbide; all of the evidence is in India,'' he said.
   Several federal lawsuits involving the accident, which occurred
when a cloud of toxic gas escaped from the Union Carbide chemical
plant in Bhopal, have been consolidated and sent to an Indian
court. Others are pending in Connecticut, Union Carbide's home
state, Musslewhite said.
   Musslewhite said he filed the lawsuit in Beaumont because Texas
has statutes allowing for punitive damages in such cases and has
many potential jurors acquainted with the hazards of living near
chemical plants.

<HEAD>Du Pont Admits Underreporting Waste Amount</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Clif is cq in 6th graf</NOTE>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at the Savannah River plutonium
plant said an ``oversight'' was responsible for underreporting of
the amount of radioactive contaminant released into a creek,
according to reports published today.
   According to a Sept. 21 report by Du Pont, which operates the
plant, a 375,000-gallon release on July 8 was contaminated by 17
millicuries of Cesium-137, a waste byproduct known to cause cancer.
   However, officials continued to collect data through
mid-September, and those updated numbers weren't in the report, The
Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle and The Augusta Herald reported in today's
editions.
   The Sept. 21 report, obtained by the newspapers last week, said
the 17-millicuries figure was based on data collected only through
July 22. On Monday, Du Pont officials increased the figure to 26
millicuries of Cesium-137.
   A millicurie is one-thousandth of a curie, the unit used to
measure radioactivity.
   The report of an unusual occurrence at the plant was prepared
July 25 and revised Sept. 16. ``The revisions should, or could,
have included the change,'' said plant spokesman Clif Webb. ``It
was an oversight. The data was available but it was not used.''
   The change, Webb said, did not make any difference in terms of
public safety or health. The report had to be completed within
three weeks of the accident, Webb said, adding it was later revised
as additional information became available.
   Poorly trained personnel and inadequate procedures were blamed
for the water being released into Four Mile Creek, which flows into
the Savannah River. No abnormal levels of the waste byproduct were
detected in the river, according to Du Pont and South Carolina
environmental officials.
   The shutdown since April of all three reactors at the plant for
maintenance and testing has raised safety questions about the
plant, which Du Pont operates for the Department of Energy.
   In another incident, about 100 plant employees were evacuated
Monday afternoon when a fan malfunctioned in the
plutonium-processing area, but officials said the workers were not
endangered.
   The fan was restarted about 30 minutes later, said Webb. The
cause of the equipment failure was under investigation. A backup
fan normally would have been activated, but the second unit was out
of service for routine maintenance, he said.
   The exhaust fan is used to circulate fresh air through the
building and to remove any releases of contamination from the
building.
   The amount of contamination would depend on how much plutonium
was being processed when such an accident occurred. Officials will
not discuss specifics on plutonium production.

<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Court of Appeals today
ordered a youth to be tried as an adult on charges that he murdered
four members of his family with an ax last February when he was 16.
   The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel reverses the
decision last spring of District Court Judge Gerard Ring, who said
David Brom should be tried as a juvenile.
   Brom, who turned 17 on Oct. 3, faces four counts of first-degree
murder for the slayings of his parents, Bernard and Paulette Brom,
both 41; sister Diane, 13; and brother Ricky, 11. The family
members were found slain in their home north of Rochester on Feb.
18. An older son who had moved out of the home earlier was not
there when the slayings occurred.
   Brom, a high school sophomore at the time of the slayings, has
been undergoing treatment at the Oaks Treatment Center in Austin,
Texas, a facility for severely disturbed children and adolescents.
Psychiatrists at hearings earlier this year described him as
severely depresssed.
   If he had been tried as a juvenile and convicted, he would be
released on his 19th birthday. If convicted in adult court, he
faces an automatic life sentence, with eligibility for parole after
17{ years.
   ``The brutal murders of these four family members has had a
major impact on society,'' the Appeals Court wrote. ``Retention of
the alleged murderer within the criminal justice system for less
than three years would constitute an excessively minimal response.''
   The Appeals Court disagreed with the trial court's contention
that the state had failed to show that Brom was not amenable to
treatment or that the public safety was not served by retaining him
in the juvenile court system.

<HEAD>Jackson Defends His Campaign Efforts for Dukakis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said today that Michael Dukakis has
the support of black voters and can beat Republican George Bush in
the Nov. 8 election if other Democrats work as hard for the ticket
as Jackson has.
   In an interview on ``CBS This Morning,'' Jackson disputed any
suggestion that he has not worked hard enough for Dukakis, the man
who beat him for the Democratic nomination at the party's Atlanta
convention in July.
   ``The fact is, since Atlanta I've traveled more miles, spoken to
more people and registered more voters for this ticket than any
Democrat has,'' Jackson said.
   ``What ought to happen now is that the other Democratic team
that made commitments in Atlanta ought to pull their weight and
together we can win,'' he said.
   Jackson said he has campaigned more widely for the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket than any governor or member of Congress. ``I
now appeal to other Democratic leaders in their congressional
sphere, in their state sphere, to match that record,'' he said.
``We can win this campaign.''
   In the campaign in general, he said, ``my concern is that we're
missing issues of substance.''
   When Dukakis proposed a national health care plan for the 37
million Americans who do not have medical insurance, ``that needs
more projecting,'' he said.
   When Bush attacks Dukakis over his membership in the American
Civil Liberties Union and on health insurance and civil rights
issues, Jackson said, ``we have both a challenge in Mr. Bush and an
opportunity in Mr. Dukakis.''
   As for black support, Jackson said Dukakis ``should be able to
count on blacks because our civil rights are threatened. ... He
should be able to count on a broad cross-section of American
people. In my judgment, he has earned it.''

   Maurice Allais, described as the man who shaped
thinking about economics and the state in postwar France, said
today he had given up hoping he would win the Nobel Memorial Prize
for Economic Science.
   ``I've been mentioned so many times before I just didn't think I
would get it,'' Allais, 77, said at his apartment in the suburb of
St. Cloud.
   Colleagues said Allais, trained as an engineer, changed fields
to economics after a visit to the United States during the
Depression, when he saw factories idled and men out of work.
   ``My motivation when I was young was an idea of being able to
improve the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many of
the problems facing the world,'' Allais told a group of reporters.
``That's what led me into economics. I saw it as a way of helping
people.''
   Allais was working at his home when he received the news he had
won.
   ``It was completely unexpected. It was just mindboggling,'' he
said.
   The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize,
said Allais was chosen ``for his pioneering contributions to the
theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources.''
   Although little-known outside France, Allais was extremely
influential at home, where senior officials in key government
ministries and state-owned industries have enormous economic power.
   Jacques Levy, director of the Ecole Nationale des Mines _ from
which Allais officially retired nine years ago, while continuing
his research and writing _ said the new laureate had a decisive
effect on economic thinking for more than two decades.
   ``He was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in
postwar France between 1945 and 1968, all the people who were in
charge of the biggest enterprises and of the state planning
apparatus,'' Levy said.
   Within the world of French economic thought after World War II _
in which leftists and rightists agreed the state should play a
major role in the economy _ Allais established a place for reliance
on market forces.
   He worked on ``a system of definition of prices which would
permit the economy to function at its best,'' Levy said.
   Allais's work provided ``a very strong base for those opposed to
government direction of the economy,'' said Jacques Lautman,
scientific director for human sciences at France's National Center
for Scientific Research.
   Allais said he hoped the Nobel Prize would allow him to continue
his work, even though he is past the official retirement age.
   ``I'm happy to have the Nobel Prize to show how absurd this
situation is,'' he said. ``It's amazing that politicians think it's
normal that they should not retire, while they think it's normal to
push scholars into retirement.''

<HEAD>Court to Consider If Flag-Burning a Crime</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts graf 7, The Supreme Court agreed.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court will determine whether
states may make it a crime to burn the American flag as a symbolic
protest, with a potentially far-reaching ruling on freedom of
expression expected in 1989.
   The justices announced Monday that they will review a Texas
statute that bans desecration of the flag. The case involves a
demonstrator who was sentenced to prison for burning a flag in a
protest during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas.
   The Texas branch of the American Civil Liberties Union urged the
justices not to review a ruling that permitted the flag burning.
The ACLU said state officials were trying to ``create a sense of
legal uncertainty'' where none exists.
   While flag-burning generally has not been a hot issue since the
days of Vietnam War protests, the case may attract considerable
attention because of the emphasis on patriotic values during the
current presidential campaign.
   Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee, has attacked
his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, for
vetoing a law requiring teachers to lead the Pledge of Allegiance
in that state's public schools. Dukakis vetoed the bill after
receiving an advisory opinion from the Massachusetts Supreme Court
saying the measure was unconstitutional.
   In the Texas case, a state appeals court last April threw out
the flag-burning conviction of Gregory Lee Johnson, who had been
sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,000.
   The Supreme Court agreed to consider reinstating Johnson's
conviction.
   Johnson was arrested on Aug. 22, 1984, while participating in a
demonstration against the Reagan administration and the Republicans.
   The protest culminated with a rally in front of Dallas City Hall
that included political chants and the flag burning.
   Johnson was convicted by a jury of violating a state law banning
the desecration of a veneraed object.
   The state appeals court said, ``The act for which (Johnson) was
convicted was clearly `speech' contemplated by the First
Amendment.''
   The state court said the Texas law against flag desecration is
too broad because it seeks to curb expression likely to cause
``serious offense.''
   Seriously offending someone is not the same as inciting to riot
_ an activity that permits restraints on free speech, the state
court said.
   It also rejected arguments by law enforcement officials that the
anti-desecration statute legitimately preserves the flag ``as a
symbol of unity.''
   ``Recognizing that the right to differ is the centerpiece of our
First Amendment freedoms, a government cannot mandate by fiat a
feeling of unity in its citizens,'' the state court said.
   In other action, the Supreme Court:
   _Agreed in a potentially important libel case to review a
$200,000 award won against an Ohio newspaper. The justices will
examine how closely appeals courts must scrutinize jury findings of
``actual malice'' when a public figure sues for libel.
   _Said it will hear a Reagan administration appeal aimed at
making it easier for the government to conduct tax-fraud
investigations. The court will use a California case involving the
Church of Scientology to settle a dispute over Internal Revenue
Service powers.
   _Let stand the espionage and theft convictions of former U.S.
intelligence analyst Samuel Loring Morison for giving secret
satellite photographs to a British magzine.
   _Agreed in a case from Ohio to decide whether states may give
larger retirement benefits to public employees based on the age
when they are forced to quit work.

   More than 500 French passengers stranded
after fire disabled their Soviet liner have resumed their
Mediterranean cruise on another Soviet ship, the shipping agents
said today.
   The passengers boarded the Leonid Brezhnev, which set out for
the Greek island of Rhodes on Monday night, said a spokesman for
the agents, S. Mifsud and Sons Limited.
   The cruise ship Shota Rustaveli was about 50 miles off Malta
when a fire started in the auxiliary engine room Friday, the Soviet
news agency Tass said in a dispatch from Moscow. It said the blaze
was put out by the crew and there were no injuries.
   Representatives of the tour operating company, Trans Tours of
Paris, said in Valletta that passengers aboard the Shota Rustaveli
were roused at 5 a.m. and spent several hours on deck wearing life
jackets. The ship arrived in Malta Saturday, pulled by tugboats.
   Tass said the tourists were offered sightseeing trips around the
Mediterranean island while awaiting the arrival of the second
passenger liner.
   Tass said the crew of the Shota Rustaveli would repair the fire
damage and the ship would return to the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   A priest who tried to negotiate an
end to the two-week standoff between five conservative nuns and
their reform-minded diocese has returned home with his mission
unfulfilled.
   One of the nuns, Sister John of the Cross, who has acted as a
spokeswoman for the group, said the nuns would not budge from their
Roman Catholic monastery, where they have locked themselves in the
infirmary, until they hear directly from the Vatican.
   ``We are all united here. There's no division among the five,''
she said in a telephone interview Monday from the Monastery of the
Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, located about 30 miles
west of New York City.
   The Rev. Kevin Culligan, dispatched by the Vatican to try to
persuade the nuns and the Diocese of Paterson to resolve their
differences, returned home to Wisconsin on Monday night.
   The Carmelite friar said he will submit a report to Cardinal
Jerome Hamer, an official of the Congregation for Religious and
Secular Institutes, an arm of the Vatican.
   ``After receiving my report within the next several days, the
congregation in Rome will make whatever decisions it judges
appropriate,'' Culligan said in a statement.
   The nuns, members of the Order of Discalced Carmelites, oppose
what they say are efforts by the monastery's new prioress, Mother
Teresa Hewitt, to modernize the order with the introduction of
television, candy and newspapers. The order traditionally has
stressed prayer and seclusion.
   The prioress spoke briefly Monday evening to reporters, saying
the protesting nuns would not cooperate with Culligan's efforts
even though ``we are all very impressed at (his) fairness and
sensitivity in handling the situation.''
   The sisters, who received official dismissal warnings in June,
say they retreated to the infirmary fearing they would be evicted
for their dissident views. Four locked themselves in the infirmary
Oct. 4 and a fifth joined them a day later. Eight other nuns live
at the monastery.
   Paterson Diocese officials say the nuns had earlier agreed to
leave. They also say the dispute amounts to a lack of obedience by
the nuns and that they could be relieved of their vows.
   The group broke off talks with Culligan on Saturday when
Culligan refused to discuss whether Paterson Diocese officials were
working to oust the nuns, Sister John said. But two of the nuns met
with him again on Monday, she said.

   Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s $11 billion bid for
Kraft Inc. would make it the world's largest maker of consumer
goods while decreasing its heavy dependence on profitable but
stagnating cigarette sales.
   Philip Morris, the 12th biggest industrial company in the
Fortune 500, launched a surprise tender offer late Monday that
would pay $90 a share to shareholders of 31st-ranked Kraft.
   If successful, the deal would be the largest non-oil takeover
ever, trailing only Standard Oil Co.'s $13.4 billion purchase of
Gulf Corp. in 1984. That company later changed its name to Chevron
Corp.
   In early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, Kraft
shot up $27 a share to $87.37{, just below the offer price, while
Philip Morris fell $5.12{ to $94.87{ because of investors' fears
that the acquisition of Kraft would dilute Philip Morris's
earnings. Trading was heavy.
   Glenview, Ill.-based Kraft indicated it might fight the
takeover, even though the offer was about 50 percent above its
closing stock price on Monday. New York-based Philip Morris, best
known for Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Benson & Hedges and Merit
cigarettes, took over General Foods Corp., the maker of Jell-O,
Maxwell House, Kool-Aid, Shake 'N Bake and Oscar Meyer, in 1985 for
$5.7 billion.
   The addition of Kraft would bring such names as Velveeta,
Thousand Island dressings, Cheez Whiz, Breyer's, Light 'n' Lively,
Sealtest and Frusen Gladje.
   ``Philip Morris is aiming for preeminence among consumer goods
marketers, and this will take them there,'' said analyst John C.
Bierbusse of A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
   With Kraft, it would displace Unilever, the British-Dutch
company, as the world's largest maker of consumer goods.
   Philip Morris revenues for the year that ended June 30 were $29
billion, and when added to Kraft's $10.5 billion for the period,
the revenues would far outstrip Unilever's $30 billion, according
to Jay H. Freedman, an analyst who follows consumer producers for
Kidder, Peabody & Co.
   In an interview late Monday, Hamish Maxwell, Philip Morris's
chairman and chief executive, said, ``Being in the food business,
we feel that we understand it.''
   Kraft and Philip Morris's General Foods are roughly the same
size and together would have roughly $20 billion in annual revenue.
That would make Philip Morris the biggest food company after Nestle
SA of Switzerland, which had revenue last year of $28 billion.
   The cigarette business generates enormous amounts of cash for
Philip Morris, but its growth is slowing even though the company
has been successful in increasing sales abroad, particularly in
developing countries.
   Tobacco will account for about 78 percent of its earnings this
year, compared with 16 percent for General Foods and smaller
amounts for Miller Brewing Co. and other units, said Bierbusse.
   The dependence on cigarettes has frightened some investors from
the stock, analysts said.
   Maxwell said the cigarette business continues to grow in profit,
revenue, physical volume and market share and has Philip Morris's
strong support. But, he conceded, ``I don't think most people would
pick it as a big growth industry for the future. ...
   ``We're trying to build our business, and we're also trying to
position it for the future and not just for the present or the
past.''
   Despite the $11 billion price, the cigarette and food giant
``can well afford it,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. in San Francisco. ``Their cash flow is $1.3
billion (a year). That's $150,000 an hour, 24 hours a day, 366 days
a year.''
   John M. Richman, Kraft chairman and chief executive, said its
board will meet in ``due course'' to consider the offer.
   He said the board ``previously concluded that the best long-term
interest of our shareholders is that Kraft continue to operate as
an independent company.''
   Kraft's directors will make a recommendation on the tender offer
by Oct. 31, Richman said, urging shareholders to hold onto their
stock until then.
   The offer took the stock market by surprise.
   In consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Kraft
stock rose 62{ cents a share to $60.12{. Philip Morris stock rose
$1.37{ a share to $100. Trading volume in both stocks was roughly
average.
   Complicating the takeover bid is a ``poison pill'' defense that
Kraft has erected to make unwanted takeovers difficult. Philip
Morris asked Kraft to dismantle the shareholder rights plan and, to
back its request, filed suit in federal district court in Chicago
seeking to force Kraft to drop the defense.
   Last year Philip Morris had $3.74 billion in operating profit on
$25.41 billion in operating revenue. Kraft had a profit of $489
million on revenue of $9.88 billion.
   Maxwell said the companies would fit well together and would not
face antitrust problems because they operate in different segments
of the food industry.
   In a letter to Richman, Maxwell wrote: ``We respect and admire
your organization, product line and commitment to quality.''

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, striving to
regain the initiative in the closing weeks of the presidential
campaign, pledged today that during his first four years as
president ``we'll turn that trade deficit back into a trade
surplus.''
   Dukakis reminded his audience at Western Michigan University
that Wednesday is the first anniversary of Oct. 19, 1987, stock
market crash.
   ``And remember why it happened?'' he asked. ``The trade deficit
had soared. Republican policies of borrow and spend and borrow and
spend had done the damage.
   ``Interest rates were going up to attract the foreign bankers we
needed to buy our massive federal debt and the speculative bubble
burst _ as it always does.''
   Campaigning in the industrial Midwest, Dukakis was fighting to
overcome the impression that Republican rival George Bush was
surging to an insurmountable lead and that their race was virtually
over.
   Dukakis and his top aides disputed a new national poll which
said Bush has a 17-point lead over the Massachusetts governor.
   Campaign chairman Paul Brountas called reporters' attention to
another poll published in the Boston Herald which showed Dukakis
trailing Bush by seven points.
   In his Kalamazoo speech, Dukakis stressed the differences he
perceived between the vice president and himself.
   ``George Bush wants to help the people who already have it
made,'' he said. ``I want to make every American a full shareholder
in the American dream....
   ``George Bush cares about the people on Easy Street. I care
about the people on Main Street. He's on their side. I'm on your
side.''
   The Democratic nominee said that in the year since the stock
market fell by 500 points, neither Bush nor the Reagan
administration had done anything to correct the underlying causes.
   ``We've got to end the Republican rainbow coalition of red ink
for our children, pink slips for our workers, greenmail for sharp
operators on Wall Street and golden parachutes for top corporate
executives,'' he said.
   Dukakis said that in its first four years, the Reagan
administration ``turned two generations of trade surpluses into the
world's largest trade deficit _ and cost our workers 5 million jobs.
   ``In the first four years of the Dukakis-Bentsen administration
we'll turn that trade deficit back into a trade surplus and reclaim
those jobs for American workers,'' he said.
   ``That's our goal _ to eliminate the trade deficit in four
years. It'll take hard work. We have to reduce the budget deficit.
We'll do it.''
   Monday night in Columbus, Ohio, Dukakis told a predominantly
black audience that the Democrats have just three weeks to 21 days
to ``mobilize our forces ... to reach out to our neighborhoods''
before the Nov. 8 election showdown.
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis learned of the new NBC News-Wall
Street Journal survey giving Bush a 17-point lead, and said ``this
business of polls is really having a terrible effect'' on the
campaign.
   ``I can only tell you that there are other polls that say very
different things about where we are and where the race is,'' the
Democratic nominee said.
   Conceding that he is the underdog, Dukakis was campaigning in
the industrial Midwest, telling voters that he would fight to
create new jobs and describing Bush as indifferent to the region's
problems.
   Dukakis said Bush ``sat on his hands while America's industrial
heartland has been fighting for its life.''
   With only 21 days left in the long presidential campaign,
Dukakis picked up the pace of his activity.
   He was in Ohio all day Monday, touring a plant on the edge of
Cleveland and then addressing workers; visiting a bowling alley in
Dayton and meeting with local residents to discuss their problems
with housing, education and drugs; then flying to Columbus for
another community meeting and then a speech at a rally.
   At rallies, he implored supporters to get out and do the
precinct work he hopes will result in an upset on Nov. 8.
   ``Those phone calls you make, the doors you knock on'' can make
the difference he told them.
   There was obvious concern among Dukakis and his aides that his
precinct workers will become discouraged by polls and by reports
that he is trimming his efforts to the bare minimum of states that
would provide the 270 electoral votes needed for election.
   Aides vehemently denied a report on Sunday that he was
concentrating on 18 states with 272 electoral votes.
   But long gone was the memory of those days when national polls
said Dukakis was 17 points ahead of Bush.
   The new NBC-Journal poll said 55 percent of the 1,378 likely
voters surveyed favored the Republican vice president and 38
percent backed Dukakis.
   The survey also said that 36 percent had a favorable opinion of
Dukakis, down from 50 percent a month ago, while 55 percent had a
favorable opinion of Bush, up from 50 percent.
   Bush's held a commanding lead among men, 64-30 percent, and a
slight edge among women, 48-44 percent.
   Dukakis said the poll numbers had ``absolutely no relationship
to anything that we have or other people have.''
   He said polling ``really drives the process to a degree ... and
everybody is doing them.''

   The Pentagon notified Congress today it had
approved the sale of three UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters to Colombia
for use by that South American nation in fighting drug trafficking.
   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Defense
Department said it would sell the three copters along with support
equipment, spare parts and pilot training services for $26 million.
   ``The sale will enhance the ability of the government of
Colombia to interdict the flow of narcotics which make their way to
the United States,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``The primary use of these helicopters will be to transport
Colombian soldiers or police in air mobile operations against
narcotics traffickers and insurgent forces. These three Blackhawks,
in addition to five already in Colombia, will provide Colombia
security forces with a significant tactical capability.''
   The Pentagon said that the U.S. Army would be responsible for
overseeing the transaction and that the prime contractor would be
Sikorsky Aircraft of Stratford, Conn.

   Gov. Richard Celeste said today he is asking
President Reagan to shut down a federally owned uranium porcessing
plant until the government takes steps to ensure it no longer
threatens the environment with radioactive pollution.
   He said he is sending Reagan a letter today demanding that the
U.S. Department of Energy, which owns the plant, provide for an
independent evaluation of plant employees and area residents to
assess the impact of its operation on their health.
   Referring to testimony last week about problems at the plant,
Celeste said in the letter to Reagan that ``This admission of
deceit and mismanagement confirms and emphasizes what we have known
in Ohio for a long time: This facility is an environmental disaster
threatening the health and safety of thousands of Ohioans.''
   Appearing at an airport news conference, Celeste also demanded
that the Energy Department treat and stabilize radioactive thorium
to reduce the threat of fire that could spew the material into the
atmosphere, and begin a final cleanup of radioactive waste stored
in two deteroirating concrete silos.
   He also wants the department to start identifying the contents
of 200,000 containers of waste that has accumulated as a result of
what the governor said is the department's negligent management of
the 1,050-acre site about 18 miles northwest of here in Fernald.
   Celeste noted testimony Friday at a congressional committee
hearing in Washington, which he said made it clear that the Energy
Department has known of dangerous environmental problems at the
Feed Materials Production Center since the plant opened  they said
they are concerned about more than three decades of radioactive
emissions into the atmosphere around the plant, and into thade progress
at the plant
with a decade-long cleanup costing more than $500 million.
   The plant processes uranium for the nation's production of
nuclear weapons.
   Neighbors of the area around the plant fear that the plant
already has polluted their land, water and air.
   In Columbus, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
today met with two families who live near the plant and heard their
concerns about the plant's safety.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Authorities foiled a military coup
attempt, but several soldiers were wounded, officials said.
   The government said Monday it averted the planned coup Sunday by
a group of army officers against Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who came
to power in a military takeover a month ago.
   Government spokesman Frantz Lubin said the plot against Avril
was led by Sgt. Patrick Frantz Bochard, who headed a government
lottery, and former Col. Samuel Jeremie, a convicted murderer who
had escaped from prison.
   Radio Soliel said ``several soldiers were wounded'' and 30 were
arrested in the attempted takeover.
   Lubin said some soldiers were arrested, but he gave no figure
and said he could not confirm the radio report indicating there
might have been shooting.
   ``Certain other officers have been discharged,'' Lubin said.
``They had maneuvered to stage a coup'' against Avril.
   He said he had no further information.
   Hubert de Roncery, a conservative politician, called Jeremie ``a
pillar'' of the Duvalier dictatorship and said there could be ``an
alliance in the works between the soldiers and the Tonton
Macoutes.''
   The Tonton Macoutes were tcceeded his father. The dictatorship
ended when the younger Duvalier fled to France in 1986 during
anti-government violence.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy headed a three-man junta until general
elections in January. Namphy staged a coup in June, ousted
President Leslie Manigat and took power. A month ago, the
50-year-old Avril deposed Namphy and declared himself president.
   About 6,000 people demonstrated Monday near the National Palace
to protest a directive by the Roman Catholic Church that would
transfer the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide out of Haiti.
   Among the causes of last month's coup was an attack on
Aristide's church in the capital. Men armed with guns, machetes and
clubs burst into the church during Mass, killing 12 people,
wounding 70 and setting the building on fire. Aristide was not
injured.
   The Haitian priest said Oct. 10 that he was told by his
superiors in Rome to leave Haiti and that they set Monday as the
deadline for his departure. He did not elaborate, but a friend said
Aristide had been told to report to a parish in Montreal.
   Another friend said Aristide was still in Haiti on Monday.
   Aristide is an advocate of liberation theology and has said the
church must take an active role against social justices. Some
church leaders have criticized Aristide for his stand.
   Catholic-run Radio Soleil said the situation was too
``explosive'' for Aristide to leave now and his transfer could
create more unrest.

   Republican vice presidential candidate
Dan Quayle said today that the Nov. 8 election will mark ``an
American turning point'' that only a George Bush administration can
navigate.
   ``Every one of these changes I have projected is going to
happen,'' said the Indiana senator. ``The question is not whether
they happen, but whether we will shape the world through them.''
   Quayle spoke at Eastern Illinois University as he embarked on a
day-long bus tour of downstate Illinois. He also crossed paths and
spoke briefly with GOP nominee Bush, who was headed for campaign
appearances in Missouri.
   Quayle aides said the two discussed foreign policy and
scheduling for a few months, and that Quayle expressed the hope
they could campaign together sometime.
   Demonstrators favoring and opposing Bush's youthful running mate
paraded noisily around the floor of the gymnasium where Quayle
spoke. The GOP forces cheered lustily when police officers formed a
line in front of anti-Quayle protesters.
   The day was described by campaign aides as full of ``controlled
spontaneity,'' with plans for folksy, colorful stops at farms and
schools as the bus caravan, nicknamed ``the Illini Express,'' made
its way toward Chicago on a cool and blustery fall day.
   Quayle was joined by Illinois Gov. James Thompson, who himself
was mentioned as a potential vice presidential running mate before
the GOP convention in New Orleans last August.
   Quayle toured Michigan all day Monday, telling audiences that
``us Midwesterners have to stick together'' against ``that man from
Massachusetts.''
   While lambasting Democrat Michael Dukakis, Quayle painted the
GOP ticket as a perfectly balanced one.
   ``With George Bush, you get experience,'' Quayle said. ``With me
you get the future, the future of America.''
   That was a theme he returned to throughout a day of campaigning
in increasingly soggy weather, and he expanded on it speaking with
reporters on his campaign plane.
   ``Hopefully, I have a few years left, I'm only 41,'' Quayle
said. ``That's something they (voters) will think about, but I
don't believe it will be a decisive factor. They vote for the top
of the ticket.''
   Most polls have shown the GOP ticket with a small but persistent
lead in the polls, and Quayle said Republicans need to guard
against overconfidence.
   ``We're not the least bit overconfident because there are still
three weeks left in this campaign,'' he said.
   Quayle wrapped up his campaign day Monday with outdoor events in
a steady and cold drizzle, and tried to turn that to his advantage.
   ``Dukakis, his favorite colors are gray and dark gray,'' Quayle
said. ``What we're having today is Dukakis weather.''
   Along the way, Quayle shrugged off a decision by the Teamsters
union to endorse Bush while at the same time pointedly declining to
back the Indiana senator.
   Quayle insisted the endorsement is ``good news for me'' because
the union is again backing a Republican.
   ``I hope that all the Teamsters, people who follow their
endorsement, rush out and vote,'' Quayle said. ``It's going to be
important to have their votes. The fact is, I'm delighted they
endorsed George Bush.''
   Other than hitting Dukakis, Quayle's focus of the day was
economics. He said Republicans have solved a series of pressing
economic woes, falling short only on budget deficits.
   ``We have, on every one of those issues, except for the budget
deficit, solved them in a very positive manner,'' Quayle said. ``We
will also meet the challenges of the budget deficit in the next
administration.''

   A federal panel recommended today that America
get serious about ensuring the health of its newborn citizens _ if
for no better reason than to save money.
   Noting that more than $3 is saved for every dollar spent on
prenatal care, the Institute of Medicine said government health
officials _ federal and local _ should seek out pregnant women to
make sure they get care they and their babies need early on rather
than wait for frail and diseased infants to be born.
   The committee to study outreach for prenatal care referred to a
1985 institute study that calculated ``that each dollar spent on
providing more adequate prenatal care to low-income, poorly
educated women could reduce total expenditures for direct medical
care of their low birthweight infants by $3.38 during the first
year of life.''
   Joyce C. Lashof, chairman of the committee, said at a news
conference today that expanding Medicaid to cover all poor,
pregnant women would cost an additional $875 million by 1993.
   ``But the most important fact is we would be saving $3 for every
dollar spent, so what we really need to be doing is calculating the
net savings,'' she said.
   Using that formula, the Medicaid expansion ``should result in
net savings of $2.5 billion,'' she said.
   George M. Ryan, a committee member, said he is very optimistic
that improvements will be made in prenatal care programs because
``if anything gets attention, it's dollars and cents.''
   ``I just don't think this nation is going to go on taking care
of handicapped infants when we can prevent the handicaps with
proper prenatal care,'' said Ryan.
   Lashof is on the faculty of the school of public health at the
University of California in Berkeley and Ryan is an obstetrics and
gynecology professor at the University of Tennessee medical school
in Memphis.
   The survey said the health problems encountered by a significant
portion of newborns includes ``a set of financial barriers ranging
from problems in private insurance and Medicaid to the complete
absence of health insurance.''
   Among its recommendations, the committee called for the nation
to ``adopt as a new social norm the principle that all pregnant
women _ not only the affluent _ should be provided access to
prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum services appropriate
to their need.''
   Recent federal legislation authorizes states to provide prenatal
care under Medicaid for families whose income is up to 185 percent
of the federal poverty line _ or more than $15,000 a year for a
family of four. However, it is left to the states to decide whether
to implement the option, which would result in a one-for-one match
in federal dollars.
   Without referring to that new state option directly, the IOM
survey said, ``Too often, communities organize outreach to help
women over and around major obstacles to care rather than removing
the obstacles themselves. To fund outreach in isolation and hope
that it alone will accomplish major improvements in the use or
prenatal services is naive and wasteful.''
   The panel concluded that the solution is action rather than more
study.
   ``The committee specifically urges that no more research be
conducted to demonstrate the importance of financial and other
institutional barriers to care,'' the report said.
   ``The committee ... recommends that the current practice of
securing funds for services under the guise of research cease.''
   It said the president, Congress and other national leaders must
``commit themselves openly and unequivocally to designing a new
maternity care system _ or systems _ dedicated to drawing all women
into prenatal care and providing them with an appropriate array of
health and social services throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and
the postpartum period.''

<TEXT>
   Bess Myerson's lawyer hammered at the star
witness against the former Miss America, pointing out
inconsistencies in her testimony and getting her to admit that she
had received electroshock treatments that may have affected her
memory.
   The cross-examination of Sukhreet Gabel, the daughter of the
judge Miss Myerson is charged with trying to bribe, began gently
Monday with the defense lawyer drawing a picture of Ms. Gabel as a
brilliant college student.
   But the lawyer, Frederick Hafetz, soon had the witness visibly
shaken, and she did not disagree when he told her that electroshock
treatments ``made your memory selective, like a Swiss cheese with
holes in it.''
   Repeatedly, Hafetz gave the jury examples of discrepancies that
have appeared during the numerous times Ms. Gabel has given
testimony _ during an appearance before a grand jury, during
depositions to the prosecution and during the trial.
   Miss Myerson, 64, her boyfriend Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43, and
former state judge Hortense Gabel are charged with a bribery
conspiracy in which the younger Ms. Gabel was given a city job in
return for her mother's decision to slash Capasso's alimony and
child-support payments in a divorce case before her.
   Miss Myerson was the commissioner of the city's Department of
Cultural Affairs. Ms. Gabel was hired in 1983 as her $19,000-a-year
special assistant.
   At one point during Monday's cross-examination in Manhattan
federal court, Ms. Gabel said she could not remember what she had
told a reporter on Sunday or what she had testified during the
previous week.
   ``My memory for events that took place in 1983 is better than
for some events that took place yesterday,'' Ms. Gabel said,
looking around the courtroom nervously. Ms. Gabel said she always
testified to the ``best of my recollection.''
   Earlier Monday, under questioning by one of the prosecutors,
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Lawrence, Ms. Gabel testified that
during the time a grand jury was investigating the alleged dealings
in 1986, Miss Myerson ordered her to keep quiet.
   ``What Bess said to me was, `Listen, I'm worried. You know
Andy's been before a grand jury,''' she said.
   ``She said, `We've got to get our stories straight. The trouble
with you is you remember too much. You've got to learn to forget
more. I've forgotten more than you'll ever know,''' Ms. Gabel
testified.
   However, under cross-examination, Ms. Gabel admitted she was
uncertain of the year she had had that alleged conversation with
Miss Myerson and also said that she had a series of 15 electroshock
treatments, quite likely during one month in the spring of 1986.
   Ms. Gabel, who now takes antidepressant drugs, agreed with
Hafetz when he told the jury she had earlier testified that the
shock treatments adversely affected her memory.

<BYLINE>Former Board Member Says Bakker Deserved Money</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A former member of PTL's board of
directors said today that Jim Bakker deserved every bonus he
received while at the helm of the television ministry and religious
theme park.
   Evelyn Spencer, testifying in PTL's $52 million lawsuit against
Bakker, his wife, Tammy, and former top aide David Taggart, said
she and other board members consistently voted unanimously in favor
of bonuses for Bakker.
   ``If a bonus came up, I voted for it,'' said Ms. Spencer, pastor
of The House of Truth Church in Oakland, Calif.
   According to IRS figures presented in court today, Bakker
received $278,000 in salary in the fiscal year ending in May 1987,
plus $1,167,000 in bonuses.
   Under cross-examination, Ms. Spencer could not recall the
precise salary of Bakker while she was on the board from November
1985 to March 1987.
   Bakker was expected to testify later today. The trial began in
bankruptcy court in September and was adjourned for about a month
before resuming Monday before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds.
   In his opening statement Monday, Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis told
the court the case against the Bakkers boiled down to allegations
they mismanaged the PTL television ministry, which went into
bankruptcy three months after Bakker resigned in March 1987 amid a
sex-and-money scandal.
   But Hovis said he would show that the Bakkers' salaries were
authorized by the ministry's board, the benefits they enjoyed
properly donated by the ministry, and the cash advances they were
given reimbursed.
   Salaries and benefits received by the PTL founders, he said,
were not only legal and properly approved but also earned.
   But because the ministry's records are now dispersed among other
legal actions, including bankruptcy court, Hovis said he may be
unable to provide precise documentation.
   ``A lot of the records are simply not available,'' he said.
   In a separate hearing Monday morning on PTL's bankruptcy case,
Reynolds said he wants to see how the proposed sale of the PTL
ministry shapes up before considering whether to liquidate the
troubled television ministry and its Heritage USA theme park near
Fort Mill.
   Reynolds postponed until Nov. 16 consideration of several
motions by creditors to move the ministry from Chapter 11
bankruptcy to Chapter 7. If those motions are granted, it would
mean Heritage USA and other ministry assets would be sold by an
immediate auction rather than by an arranged sale.
   The judge said at a hearing last month he would hear the motions
to convert to Chapter 7 if no buyer were found for Heritage USA.
Canadian businessman Stephen Mernick has since signed a contract
with PTL Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to buy Heritage USA for $115
million.

   A 40-year-old man and his five sons were rescued
after drifting helplessly in the Pacific for more than a month, and
he says he'd like to go back and retrieve their 33-foot sailboat.
   ``We put everything we had into that boat, sold everything, even
our furniture, to buy it,'' said Clint Fleishour of San Diego, who
along with his sons was rescued late Thursday by a Navy tugboat.
   ``We've been on the water a lot. My older boys have experience
sailing,'' Fleishour said. ``I'd like to go back and get it.''
   But Fleishour said he knew the family's safety was more
important than their boat. He said he had feared he would see his
five sons die of starvation before they were rescued.
   Fleishour said he and his sons _ Ignacio, 17; Martin, 15; Kazan,
13; Clint Jr., 11; and Rocky, 8 _ spent 33 days adrift in their
sailboat Paloma before being rescued by the Narragansett, a Navy
tugboat operated by civilians, 550 miles northeast of Honolulu on
Thursday night.
   They survived eight days without food and five without water, he
said.
   ``My estimation is the kids would have lasted _ with no water,
no food _ approximately 10 days,'' said David George, second
officer aboard the tugboat. ``In my opinion, the 8-year-old should
have passed away.''
   ``The youngest boy was not very responsive,'' said George, who
doubles as a medical officer. ``Two of the five kids were spitting
up blood and had some form of a perforated ulcer.''
   But none of the boys was hospitalized Sunday after they reached
Honolulu, where they stayed at a shelter, Fleishour said.
   ``The rescue was beautiful, like a dream,'' the father said.
``But the worst, the worst, was watching my kids starve to death
right before my eyes, watching my little baby wander around that
boat looking for something _ anything _ to eat.''
   Fleishour said he and his family left San Diego on Sept. 12 for
what should have been about a two-week sail to Hawaii, bringing
enough food and water _ 40 gallons _ to last 16 days.
   But the boat hit a squall and drifted for about 700 miles. They
got the boat back on course, but its sails broke and rations ran
low, he said.
   ``It got rough. A lot of times we lost hope, but I tried to be
tough for the kids,'' Fleishour said. ``We caught five fish in 17
days and caught rainwater and licked the dew off in the morning.''
   ``The Navy spotted us Thursday night, but it was Friday before
we were all on board,'' he said. ``They gave us soup and ham
sandwiches. I don't know how much longer we could have lasted.''
   A construction worker who was born in Hawaii but lived in
California for 31 years, Fleishour said he would stay in Hawaii and
look for a job.

   Chinese forces killed eight Vietnamese
while continuing their heavy shelling of Vietnamese territory in
recent weeks, the official Vietnam News Agency said.
   Chinese troops armed with machine guns and rifles fired on a
group of border guards who were making bricks in Vietnam's Lai Chau
province bordering China, it said. Four guards were killed and two
wounded in the Oct. 10 attack, said the dispatch dated Monday and
seen in Bangkok on Tuesday.
   It said one border guard and three local militiamen were killed
Sept. 15, when Chinese forces fired 300 mortar rounds into another
border province, Ha Tuyen. Eleven others including six civilians
were injured.
   The Chinese made 13 intrusions into Vietnamese territory from
Sept. 15 to Oct. 16, and rained more than 4,000 artillery and
mortar rounds on Vi Xuyen district of Ha Tuyen, the agency claimed.
   The communist adversaries have traded such accusations since
they split after the Vietnam War and fought a frontier war in 1979.
It is not possible to confirm the fighting, and Western diplomats
say accounts usually are exaggerated.

   A weapons manufacturer Tuesday
unveiled the first South African-made pistol, a result of the
government's campaign to negate the effects of an international
arms boycott.
   The 9mm pistol, called the Z88, was developed for the South
African police by a subsidiary of the state arms corporation.
   South Africa had been able to import pistols despite the arms
embargo implemented by the United Nations in 1977, but officials
said prices were excessive and delivery times often slow.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said the new pistol ``stood
head and shoulders above'' foreign-made models.
   Since the embargo was imposed, the weapons industry has
developed into South Africa's most lucrative manufacturing sector,
despite attempts by the United Nations to discourage members from
buying South African arms.
   Jane's Defense Weekly, the respected British military
publication, estimated that South Africa earned $900 million last
year exporting arms to 23 countries.

   The catering staff of Britain's House of Commons
should be sent to the French National Assembly and other European
capitals to become ``civilized'' about cooking, a lawmaker said
Tuesday.
   Teresa Gorman, a Conservative member of Parliament, said that
European parliamentary chefs should also be sent to London to
transform the ``grizzly'' cuisine in Parliament.
   ``They (English chefs) are serving up all this sausage and beans
and plum duff (a rich dessert) which is supposedly what we like,''
Mrs. Gorman said.
   ``But we get no option. There is a monopoly in the catering
service in the Commons and we should break it.''
   ``The only way to do that is to arrange an exchange scheme
whereby our entire catering staff go to Paris, Rome and then Bonn
with their catering teams coming to Westminster in rotation,'' she
said.
   ``The food we get at Westminster is pretty grizzly ... all these
steaming pots of horrible lumps of meat that have been in the
steamer for about 10 hours.''
   Mrs. Gorman said she believes French chefs ``would civilize''
the English chefs ``in the art of cooking.''
   ``Our catering staff should be shifted around Europe, preferably
not coming back,'' she said.
   ``They will start putting arsenic in my soup if I go on like
this,'' she added.

<HEAD>Top U.S. Commander Says U.S. Gained Credibility in Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has gained
unprecedented credibility with Arab leaders as a result of its
large-scale naval commitment in the Persian Gulf, according to the
general who runs U.S. military operations in the strategic waterway.
   ``This may be the first successful military application of a
political objective that we've pulled off, perhaps, since Korea,''
said Gen. George B. Crist.
   The four-star Marine Corps officer, who retires next month as
commander of U.S. Central Command, said in an interview aboard the
U.S. Navy's gulf flagship USS La Salle:
   _ The United States has its strongest-ever relations with Arab
states, who originally expected Washington to ``cut and run''
rather than become deeply involved in trying to stop Iranian
military moves in the gulf.
   _ The Soviet Union, whose effort to establish a presence in the
gulf helped spur the U.S. decision, recently has bolstered its
fleet and is ``not showing any signs of withdrawal.''
   _ The United States will continue to reduce its naval force if
the Aug. 20 Iraq-Iran cease-fire holds, but Kuwait will decide when
to remove the Stars and Stripes from 11 oil tankers reflagged by
the Reagan administration 17 months ago as protection from Iranian
attack.
   _ A major mine threat still exists and as allied navies pull
out, ``the big question'' is who will wind up with the task of
clearing them.
   Crist, 57, has been both diplomat and military officer during
his three-year tenure at the Tampa, Fla.-based Central Command,
which began as a one-time ``ready reaction force'' and now
administers U.S. military affairs in 19 countries.
   This encompasses the gulf, where danger to shipping from the
eight-year Iraq-Iran war prompted last year's massive naval buildup
by the United States and five European governments.
   Crist said that commitment has enabled Washington to establish
better diplomatic ties and ``closer cooperation and coordination''
militarily with gulf Arab governments than ever before.
   ``We've moved mountains,'' he said. ``They were absolutely
convinced we were going to cut and run. We didn't.'' He added, in a
parting comment without elaboration: ``It was a near thing,
though.''
   Most Arab states are cool toward the United States because of
its pro-Israel stance, and rarely praise U.S. policy. But Crist
said Washington has managed to win new friends in the gulf.
   ``They don't want the Russians in. They like the Americans.
We're not colonial, we're not overbearing,'' he said. In working
with Americans, he added, ``they've gained a lot more confidence in
their own capabilities that they didn't have before.''
   Although refusing to allow U.S. bases on their territory,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman quietly have provided
limited support facilities for the Navy, which Crist said he could
not have done without.
   Crist said the mine threat is serious in the northern gulf,
where both belligerents sowed mines. Other U.S. officers have said
there may be as many as 200 left.
   Six U.S. mine sweepers were ``probably the last capability'' he
would remove, Crist said. Some European navies already are
withdrawing theirs, and it's unclear whether the United States will
wind up with the mine-clearing task, he said.
   That decision may fall to Army Lt. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf,
scheduled to succeed Crist at Central Command on Nov. 23.
   When the reflagged convoys began, the Navy's gulf-based Middle
East Force included only the La Salle and four combatants. As the
``tanker war'' escalated, the U.S. regional fleet grew to as many
as 40 ships. There currently are 26, including 10 in the gulf.
   Crist said the United States would ``ratchet this thing down''
to around the original level as circumstances permit, but will
never leave the gulf entirely.
   ``We've been here since 1949, and as long as the Russians stay
around, I don't think we're going to turn the keys to the storeroom
over,'' he said.
   He said the Soviets keep seven to nine ships in the area and
``are not showing any signs of withdrawal.''
   Moscow recently deployed the 11,000-ton hospital ship Ob, fitted
as a floating rest center for Soviet sailors, he said.
   Although the Navy recently ended close escort of the Kuwaiti
tankers, Crist said the ships will have ``traditional protection''
as long as Kuwait complies with U.S. maritime and tax laws.

<HEAD>Excerpts From Nobel Citation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the citation by
the Royal Swedish Academy of Science awarding the Nobel Memorial
Prize in Economic Science to Maurice Allais of France:
   One of the principal tasks of basic research in economics is to
formulate a rigorous model of equilibrium in markets and examine
the efficiency of this equilibrium. The problem dates back to Adam
Smith and his theory of the ``invisible hand'' which coordinates a
_ to all appearances _ chaotic structure comprised of a multitude
of independent and individual decisions based on self-interest.
Paradoxically, this chaos gives rise to coordinated equilibria
based on market prices. Firms' production decisions will correspond
to consumers' planned consumption....
   The foremost contribution of Maurice Allais was made in the
1940s when he continued to develop Walras' and Pareto's work by
providing increasingly rigorous mathematical formulations of market
equilibrium and the efficiency properties of markets. On the basis
of mathematical models of households' and firms' planning and
choice, he introduced a very general formulation of the conditions
for market equilibrium....
   Allais' outstanding achievements may be characterized as basic
research in economics. By his links to an older French tradition in
economic research, Maurice Allais is the most prominent figure in
modern economic research in France as regards basic theory and
applications to public-sector planning. Even though his fundamental
research has been relatively little known beyond the
French-speaking sphere, Allais has had a far-reaching indirect
impact through younger French economists who have been strongly
influenced by his work....
   The sum of Allais' productive achievements in economic theory is
considerable. Moreover, he has carried out various applied studies
in e.g. operations research and has participated extensively in
debates in the French press. Alongside his accomplishments as an
economist, Allais has published studies in history and physics,
particularly geophysics.

   The disappearances and mutilations of up to
30 cats have distressed residents in a city neighborhood, but
police suspect that ``crazy kids'' rather than a cult are
responsible.
   ``It really has bothered us,'' said Vicky Lusk. ``We don't want
children finding mutilated animals.''
   Twenty-five to 30 cats have disappeared since late spring, said
Mrs. Lusk, one of about 300 residents of the Surrey Hills
neighborhood who attended a special town meeting Monday night. ``My
cat has been missing since July and my sister has one missing.''
   Police department Capt. Bob Jones said 12 cat carcasses have
been found.
   Parts of dismembered cats appear to have been left in places
where they will be spotted easily, Mrs. Lusk said.
   Residents are ``finding parts of them on open land, in the park,
on the golf course,'' she said.
   ``It definitely is not a coyote or other animal ... the heads
have been cut off or they have been cut in half,'' she said.
``Somebody has been doing this.''
   Lynda Powell, director of Volunteers For Animal Welfare, said
she has received several calls from pet owners in Surrey Hills who
reported their cats missing. Her organization has posted a $500
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
those responsible, she said.
   Oklahoma City Police Det. Bob Smart told the residents at the
meeting there was no evidence to link the disappearances and
dismemberings to any cult or to suggest that the culprits could
attack people.
   ``We haven't seen ... (or) heard of children being approached,''
Smart said.
   But Mrs. Lusk remained unconvinced.
   ``We can't prove any rituals are involved,'' she said.
``Everybody knows there are cults that do use cats. The parts of
the bodies have been placed in different ways. They weren't just
thrown out of a car.''
   Police spokesman Lt. Charles Owen said authorities ``didn't know
about it until about three this afternoon.''
   ``It happening in the warm months makes me think it's a bunch of
crazy kids going around doing some weird stuff,'' he said.

<HEAD>West German Pilot Wants to Come Back to Moscow For a Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mathias Rust, who landed his small plane on Red
Square last year, wants to return to Moscow, ``but this time with a
ticket,'' a Soviet official said Tuesday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov made it clear,
however, that the West German will find the welcome in Moscow no
warmer than it was the first time around, when he was sentenced to
four years in prison for malicious hooliganism, violating
international flight rules and illegally entering the Soviet Union.
   Rust was freed in August by a special act of the Supreme Soviet,
the national legislature, and expelled to West Germany after more
than a year in prison. But Gerasimov noted the criminal case
remains, ``and he can expect some difficulties if he wants to come
back.''
   Rust was arrested on landing in Red Square and spent the next 14
months in Moscow's Lefortovo Prison. He was driven directly from
the prison to Sheremetyevo Airport when he was expelled.
   The young pilot evaded Soviet air defenses before buzzing the
Kremlin and landing on before a startled crowd on Red Square on May
28, 1987.
   The flight also prompted the Soviet Union to fire its defense
minister and the air defense chief, and to treat Rust as a criminal
rather than the peace advocate he claimed to be at his trial.

<HEAD>Iraq Agrees To Prisoner Exchange If Iran Accepts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has agreed to the exchange of
prisoners of war taken in the Persian Gulf war, but maintains the
move is not related to its peace talks with Iran, according to a
document released today.
   Ismat Kittani, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said in
a letter to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that Iraq
will begin the POW exchange if Iran reciprocates.
   In the Iraqi letter to Perez de Cuellar, dated Monday, Kittani
separated the move to release prisoners from the talks over
Security Council Resolution 598, the U.N. peace plan to end the
8-year war.
   ``Since the exchange of prisoners is a humanitarian matter'' in
response to a Red Cross request, ``our agreement on this step is
unrelated to the other issues referred to in'' the U.N. plan.
   Security Council Resolution 598 called for an immediate
cease-fire, withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized
boundries and the exchange of prisoners.
   The two nations accepted a U.N.-mediated cease-fire that began
Aug. 20, but peace talks have been deadlocked since just after they
began Aug. 25.
   Kittani's letter said Iraq has asked the International Committee
of the Red Cross to begin registering all prisoners of war who are
not yet on official POW lists, and asked for detailed medical
examinations of all POWs in Iran and Iraq.
   Each nation is to receive a copy of each POW's medical report
before their exchange, Kittani said.
   According to the Red Cross, Iran has 50,182 prisoners and Iraq
19,284 prisoners. But U.N. officials and diplomats in Iran and Iraq
believe Iran has 60,000-70,000 prisoners and Iraq 30,000-50,000
prisoners.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, a senior Iraqi official today rejected a
condition offered by Iran for a permanent settlement of the war.
   Foreign Undersecretary Nizzar Hamdoun said Iran was setting
unacceptable conditions by insisting that both countries maintain a
1975 treaty setting the border in the middle of the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway.
   Iraq said the treaty, which draws the border in the middle of
the waterway instead of along the Iranian shoreline, is no longer
valid.
   ``The Iranian position... is an attempt to pressurize Iraq to
relinquish its political and legal rights while the two sides are
discussing purely technical issues,'' Hamdoun said.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali-Akbar Velayati, said Monday that
Iran agreed to the U.N. peace plan but only on condition that the
1975 treaty is upheld.
   Peace talks stalled over Iraq's insistance the waterway be
cleared of silt and ships that were sunk early in the war. Iran had
rejected the demand saying it was a secondary issue that could be
settled later.
   Both sides have blamed each other for the stalemate in
negotiations, which resume next week in Geneva.

<HEAD>Ten Convicted of Treason in Liberia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten people, including a former
presidential candidate and a judge, have been sentenced to 10-year
prison terms after being convicted of plotting to overthrow and
kill President Samuel K. Doe.
   Judge George Tulay sentenced the defendants Monday after
rejecting their request for a retrial filed last week on the
grounds of jury tampering by government officials.
   The convicted included Gabriel Kpolleh, Liberia Unity Party's
presidential candidate in 1985, and Cpehas Mbandi, a former
associate judge.
   All the defendants said they would appeal against the sentences.
   A jury unanimously returned a verdict of guilty Oct. 7 after an
eight-week trial that featured 21 prosecution witnesses and 10
defense witnesses.
   The defendants were among 14 indicted by a grand jury in March
on charges of plotting to assassinate Doe and replace his
government with a People's Reorganization Council.
   The prosecution said four of the 14 could not be found. During
the trial, witnesses said one of them, Joseph Robert Kaipaye,
committed suicide by jumping out a window at the Executive Mansion,
Doe's official residence.
   Prosecution witnesses said the defendants met several times
since 1986 to discuss their plans and had a cache of arms,
including grenades, rifles and ammunitions to use in the takeover.
   Doe has been the target of several assassination plots and coup
attempts. An abortive Nov. 12, 1985 coup attempt, after elections
oppositions leaders said were rigged, resulted in more than 600
deaths.
   In July, Doe said a 12-man invading force led by his former
second in command, Maj.-Gen. Nicholas Podier Jr., was intercepted
at the border with Ivory Coast, Liberia's eastern neighbor.
   Podier and four companions died in a gunbattle with Liberian
security men. Two Americans have been charged with treason in the
Podier plot.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today Republican policies caused
last year's stock market plunge, and he promised big economic
changes to avoid another. Rival George Bush declared the Iron
Curtain ``a rusting curtain'' but said U.S. vigilence is still
necessary.
   Both men said the presidential race is not over, despite a new
poll showing a big Bush lead with just three weeks till Election
Day.
   Bush, in remarks prepared for delivery in Fulton, Mo., where
Winston Churchill 46 years ago used the term ``Iron Curtain'' in a
speech, said:
   ``The iron curtain still stretches from Stettin to Trieste. But
it's a rusting curtain.''
   ``The Soviets are restrained by their own troubles, But they are
also restrained by our strength, our ability to deter aggression,
the unity of the democracies,'' he said.
   Bush declined to celebrate his lead in public opinion surveys,
saying, ``There are undecided voters out there. The race is close
in many states. No votes can be taken for granted and I'm not
taking any votes for granted. I will continue to campaign as an
underdog.''
   Dukakis, speaking in Kalamazoo, Mich., to a Western Michigan
University audience, said, ``We've got to end the Republican
rainbow coalition of red ink for our children, pink slips for our
workers, greenmail for sharp operators on Wall Street and golden
parachutes for top corporate executives.''
   Turning to the stock market drop, which occurred one year ago
Wednesday, Dukakis said, ``And remember why it happened? The trade
deficit had soared; Republican policies of borrow and spend and
borrow and spend had done the damage.
   ``Interest rates were going up to attract the foreign bankers we
needed to buy our massive federal debt and the speculative bubble
burst _ as it always does.''
   He pledged that during the first four years of a Dukakis
administration, ``we'll turn that trade deficit back into a trade
surplus.''
   Dukakis spent much of Monday trying to reinvigorate his
campaign, even as a new poll showed him falling farther behind
Bush. The Democrat also took a swipe at Bush during a rally with
black voters in Columbus, Ohio, saying, ``Something is very wrong
when a presidential candidate calls Jesse Helms a hero and Jesse
Jackson a hustler.''
   Jackson himself, in an interview today on ``CBS This Morning,''
disputed any suggestion that he has not worked hard enough for
Dukakis, the man who beat him for the Democratic nomination at the
party's Atlanta convention in July.
   ``The fact is, since Atlanta I've traveled more miles, spoken to
more people and registered more voters for this ticket than any
Democrat has,'' Jackson said.
   He said Dukakis has the support of black voters and can beat
Bush if other Democrats work as hard for the ticket as Jackson has.
   Bush used a tour of a Martin Marietta defense plant in
Littleton, Colo., on Monday to talk of a military role in securing
world peace and to ridicule Dukakis' defense stand.
   The vice president is not letting up on his attacks on Dukakis
despite a 17-point lead in the latest nationwide poll. The Bush
campaign is releasing three new television ads today, including one
incorporating news footage of Dukakis driving a tank, said
spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   The Washington Post reported today that the Bush campaign has
saved more than half of its $30 million advertising budget and will
target the airwaves in California, New Jersey and Ohio.
   The newspaper said the information was based on an internal
campaign document obtained by the Post. The Bush campaign had no
comment on the report, said Ms. Tate.
   Another Bush ad, which aired this past weekend, suggests that
only the vice president is experienced enough to negotiate with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``This is no time to train somebody in how to meet with the
Russians,'' the commercial says. ``This is the time for strength
and experience. This is the time for somebody who's ready on Day
One to be president.''
   Bush's running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle said today at
Eastern Illinois University, at the beginning of a bus tour of
small and medium-size Illinois towns, that this year's election
marks ``an American turning point'' that only the GOP can properly
handle.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen was
campaigning in California, the biggest Electoral College prize with
47 votes.
   Bentsen, campaigning in California Monday, invoked the image of
Harry Truman's come-from-behind victory in decrying GOP distortions
of Dukakis' record.
   ``It was Harry Truman who said that you have to appeal to the
best instincts of people, not to their worst,'' Bentsen said.
``Sometimes you can win a few elections that way, but you really
hurt your country.''
   Meanwhile, an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll showed Bush leading
Dukakis, 55-38 percent, among 1,378 likely voters surveyed Friday
through Sunday. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus
three percentage points.
   Almost three-quarters of those polled said they expected Bush to
win the election, including half of Dukakis' own supporters.
   But the Democratic nominee and his running mate disputed the
survey's results.
   ``This business of polls is really having a terrible effect,''
on the process, Dukakis said. ``I can only tell you that there are
other polls that say very different things about where we are and
where the race is.''
   Bentsen said he didn't believe the poll was accurate, and said,
``You see wide fluctuations among those polls. That's what's
happening.''
   For his part, Bush said only, ``Run like you're 17 points
behind.''

   Americans are increasingly reluctant to
tolerate landfills near their homes but haven't really faced the
problem of what to do about all that garbage, according to a poll
commissioned by waste-handling companies.
   The poll results, released Tuesday by the National Solid Waste
Management Association, were taken from telephone interviews with
1,500 randomly selected adults in February, telephone interviews
with 500 ``opinion leaders'' in March and face-to-face interviews
with another 1,500 people in July and August.
   The February survey found that 30 percent of respondents would
favor building new landfills in their communities to handle garbage
and trash, while 62 percent were opposed. The remainder were
undecided.
   Opposition was about the same _ 65 percent, in the summer poll,
but those in favor had dropped to 20 percent.
   Rob Wasserstrom, public affairs director of the association,
said that even if half the nation's garbage were recycled in five
years, ``the remaining garbage would exceed our landfill capacity''
without new landfills or incincerators.
   The July-August survey found that 33 percent favored state or
federal boards that could override local opposition to new
facilities, and 46 percent opposed. ``I was surprised'' that
support was as high as a third, Wasserstrom said.
   Among opinion leaders, 57 percent favored such boards and 40
percent opposed.
   When incinerators that can sell energy to hold down costs are
matched against landfills, incinerators win _ but people still
don't want incinerators, according to the poll. Forty-seven percent
of the sample opposed such ``waste-to-energy'' plants in the
community, and 36 percent were in favor.
   ``People's attitudes about garbage disposal are highly
contradictory,'' Wasserstrom said. ``A large majority of the
population would like to believe recycling is the answer.'' Yet
many respondents ``correctly indentified 25 to 50 percent as a
realistic range'' that could be recycled.
   Jack Lyman, director of resource recovery programs for the
association, said he had discovered a ``NIMEY'' _ ``Not in my
election year'' _ to go along with the well-known ``NIMBY''
response _ ``Not in my back yard.''
   ``What we need in this country is the political will to deal
with these problems,'' Lyman said.
   Seventy percent of the February sample and 84 percent of the
summer group said recycling could ``solve much of the solid waste
disposal problem.'' When those polled were asked how much could be
recycled, the median answer was 44 percent _ half named a
percentage above 44 percent and half named one below.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that 10
percent of the annual stream of 230 million tons of garbage and
trash is recycled currently, with another 5 percent incinerated.
The agency hopes to cajole and persuade state and local governments
into making that 25 percent in 1992.
   The waste association represents 2,500 companies that handle
half the nation's household waste and 95 percent of its industrial
waste. It has conducted polls on garbage questions for several
years.
   For a poll of 1,500 people, the margin of error is about 3
percentage points either way; for a poll of 500, the margin is a
little less than 4.5 points.

<HEAD>No Fifth Superpower Summit, Fitzwater Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's spokesman on Tuesday
dismissed speculation of a fifth superpower summit in the waning
days of the administration, saying the idea is ``completely ruled
out.''
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the White House generally
hesitates to make flat statements about future plans, but in the
case of another summit, ``We have to say no possiblity.''
   No plans are under way for Reagan to meet with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev before the president quits office in mid-January,
Fitzwater said. ``Yes, I think it is completely ruled out,'' he
said in response to a reporter's question.
   The superpower leaders have held four summit since they first
met in Geneva, Switzerland, in November 1985. Other summits were
conducted in Iceland in October 1986, in Washington in December
1987 and in Moscow last May.
   In Washington, the two men signed a treaty eliminating their
countries' intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   Fitzwater also said that comments made over the weekend by
Deputy CIA Director Robert M. Gates were ``totally consistent''
with the administration's views on what is happening inside the
Soviet Union.
   Gates, in speeches Friday and Saturday, gave a gloomy assessment
of current events in the Soviet Union, and said Moscow has stepped
up its spying activities against Americans since Gorbachev came to
power.
   He said Gorbachev's reforms have not brought about economic
improvements and, ``I would even say it is doubtful that Gorbachev
can rejuvenate the Soviet system.'' Moreover, the Soviet system is
threatened by ethnic disturbances, he said.
   While the administration might not agree with the CIA on every
point, Fitzwater said, Gates' comments ``quite correctly point out
the things that we need to be very concerned about in dealing with
the Soviet Union.''
   He said Reagan and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci have pointed
out that the United States wants to see the Soviet Union reduce its
defense budget to underscore a commitment to world peace.
   ``We feel we do have better relations with the Soviet Union and
the president has good relations with Secretary General
Gorbachev,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``But the system is the same, the country is the same and the
threat is the same and we need to be quite aware of that,'' he said.

   Two construction workers, left dangling 140 feet
above a Manhattan street when their scaffolding collapsed, were
rescued unharmed Tuesday after 45 minutes in midair, the Fire
Department said.
   The men were working on a building at the Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center when a motor on the scaffold gave out, dumping both
men from the platform on the 15th floor, said Fire Chief Michael
Loghran.
   ``When we arrived, the scaffold was hanging straight down and
the workers were about 140 feet above the ground,'' said Loghran.
The men were both suspended from safety ropes attached to the top
of the building, he said.
   Firefighters moved a construction shed to allow a 100-foot
rescue ladder in at the workers, Loghran said. Because the building
is on a slope, the 100-foot ladder was able to reach the men,
Loghran said.
   Firefighters loaded the men into the ladder bucket and brought
them down uninjured, said Loghran.

   Plagued by high winds in the
Shinnecock Inlet, officials on Tuesday postponed plans to tow a
stranded whale from Peconic Bay to the open ocean. They said they
may try Thursday.
   The adolescent minke whale wandered into Peconic Bay last week,
according to Sam Sadove, the director of the Okeanos research
foundation. He said the whale is emaciated from lack of food and
disoriented, but is behaving normally.
   Pat Logan, an administrative assistant at the foundation, said
winds in the inlet forced researchers to cancel the towing attempt
and will likely force a postponement until Thursday.
   When conditions improve, divers from the foundation will attach
a rope to the whale's tail and then put the animal in a harness and
remove the tail rope, according to Sadove.
   The whale will then be attached to two Coast Guard boats and
towed into the Atlantic.
   The whale was first discovered by boaters in Sag Harbor two
weeks ago, and then moved into shallow waters of peconic bay.
Sadove says the whale is 17 feet long and weighs five tons. This is
the first whale sighted in Peconic Bay, according to Okeanos's
records, which go back to 1880.

<HEAD>Report: City Economy Survived Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The city's economy fared much better than
expected in the year after last October's stock market crash,
according to a report released Tuesday by state Comptroller Edward
V. Regan.
   ``While the securities industry clearly was hurt by the crash,
the impact has been far less severe than originally forecast,''
Regan said. ``Furthermore, the rest of the city's economy has been
little affected.''
   The report predicted that the city will gain 35,000 jobs this
year, despite post-crash predictions of job losses ranging from
10,000 to 47,000.
   The projected 1988 loss of 7,000 security industry jobs will be
more than offset by an increase of 30,000 service jobs, according
to the report. Even businesses closely tied to finance, such as law
and printing, have shrugged off the impact of the crash.
   The report listed these signs of economic vitality:
   _The city unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in the second
quarter of the year, the lowest since 1970.
   _The ``gross city product,'' a measure of economic output,
posted its strongest annual growth in 20 years: 3.4 percent for the
12 months ending with June.
   _Retail sales and tourism are up, and the welfare caseload is
down.
   But the report warns that the city faces problems. The
securities industry could lose an another 7,000 jobs next year, and
there also may be a slowdown in employment in the real estate and
banking industries.
   The report also noted that the 35,000-job increase for 1988 is
smaller than the figure for each of the four previous years, and
that many of those still employed in the security industry have
taken pay cuts.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, speaking where
Winston Churchill gave his famed ``iron curtain'' speech 42 years
ago, declared today the barriers surrounding the Soviet bloc are
rusting but that America must still stand tough against the Soviet
Union.
   Bush invoked the British statesman's memory in remarks prepared
for delivery at Westminster College, where Churchill popularized
the phrase ``iron curtain'' in 1946 to describe the barrier of
self-imposed isolation and secrecy that enclosed the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe after World War II.
   Noting his widening lead over Democratic rival Michael Dukakis
in pre-election polls, the Republican nominee said both Churchill
and former President Truman knew that ``no election was over until
it was really over.`
   ``There are undecided voters out there,'' Bush said. ``The race
is close in many states. No votes can be taken for granted, and I'm
not taking any votes for granted. I will continue to campaign as an
underdog.''
   Bush did not include any attack or mention of Dukakis in his
speech today, which quoted at length from Churchill's speech at
Fulton.
   ``The iron curtain still stretches from Stettin to Trieste. But
it's a rusting curtain,'' Bush said.
   The vice president said ``there is a new hope of change'' in
Eastern bloc countries, but it would be wrong to conclude that the
Soviets were deterred from aggression by their preoccupation with
economic troubles.
   ``The Soviets are restrained by their own troubles, But they are
also restrained by our strength, our ability to deter aggression,
the unity of the democracies,'' Bush said.
   He said U.S. military strength made possible the signing last
year of the treaty calling for destruction of all U.S. and Soviet
medium-range nuclear missiles.
   Bush said similar reductions aimed at balancing U.S. and Soviet
convention arms in Europe ``will be a high priority for me.''
   On Monday in Skokie, Ill., the vice president stumped for Jewish
votes in the heavily Jewish suburb of Chicago that was wrenched a
decade ago by a battle over a neo-Nazi march.
   Speaking in a driving rain at an outdoor memorial to Holocaust
victims, Bush said the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews in world
War II was ``an evil far more vast than any in human history.''
   But he said the memorial offers ``hope for the persistence of
Jewish dreams and for the promise of Jewish lives yet unlived.''
   Bush later had time to comment on his surge in the polls,
including a new NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll showing him ahead
of his Democratic opponent by 55 percent to 38 percent.
   ``We have three weeks to go from this very minute,'' he told a
rally at the College of Du Page in Glen Ellyn, Ill. ``And I am
running as if I were 10 points behind. I'm not going to let up.''
In Columbia, Mo., where he spent the night, Bush said: ``Run like
you're 17 points behind.''
   Today Bush was traveling to Westminster College in Fulton, Mo.,
for a foreign policy speech. Westminster College is where the late
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill introduced the phrase
``iron curtain'' to refer to the Soviet bloc countries in 1946.
   Continuing attacks on Dukakis as weak on foreign affairs and
defense, the Bush campaign was planning to air a new ad using
footage from a Dukakis campaign appearance that backfired on the
Democrat: his test ride in a tank.
   An ad that was released over the weekend suggested Bush would be
best able to deal with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``This
is no time to train somebody in how to meet with the Russians,''
the ad says.
   Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate had no information on a Washington
Post report today that the campaign was tentatively planning to
spend more than $15 million of its $30 million-plus advertising
budget in three states. The three states are California, New Jersey
and Ohio, the Post said.
   While in Skokie, Bush did not mention the turmoil that occurred
10 years ago when a neo-Nazi group planned a march in the
community. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully fought
efforts by the community to block the march, but the white
supremacists decided to hold it in a Chicago park instead.
   The Bush campaign gave reporters no chance to get close enough
to Bush to ask him his views on that case or the ACLU involvement.
   Bush has been relentless in attacking Dukakis as a member of the
ACLU, a group Bush faults for far-left positions.
   Ms. Tate said that in a longer speech that was cut short because
of the rain, Bush had intended to mention the controversy, in which
he agreed with the Skokie government. But she said he had not
intended to mention the ACLU.
   In remarks pared down to just a few minutes, Bush said he was
``committed to the survival of Israel.''
   ``We must keep that strategic partnership, and then we must
maintain that deterrent that comes of military and diplomatic
resolve,'' he said.
   In his earlier defense speech, Bush pledged to reform the
Pentagon procurement system to cut waste.

<HEAD>Three Escaped Activists Plan To Emerge From U.S. Consulate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three escaped anti-apartheid
activists holed up in the U.S. Consulate for five weeks plan to
``call the state's bluff'' and emerge from their refuge Wednesday.
   The activists disclosed their decision Tuesday after advice was
relayed to them from jailed black leader Nelson Mandela. The three
previously had said they mistrusted the government's pledge to let
them leave the consulate without being redetained.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, said Monday she discussed the activists
when she met Saturday with her husband, who is recovering from
tuberculosis at a hospital in Cape Town. Mrs. Mandela said she
passed on unspecified suggestions from her husband to the escapees'
lawyers.
   The three activists _ prominent leaders of banned opposition
groups _ have been living in a meeting room at the consulate on the
11th floor of a Johannesburg office building since their escape
Sept. 13.
   The government has said the men are free to leave and will not
be detained again or restricted.
   ``The three have called the state's bluff and intend to leave
... to claim their freedom,'' said a statement issued on their
behalf by the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest
anti-apartheid group not banned from functioning.
   The activists' decision ``is a major test of the government's
undertaking and will once again bring the spotlight on the
detention and persecution of anti-apartheid activists,'' said the
congress, the main black labor federation.
   The three activists are Murphy Morobe and Mohammed Valli Moosa,
senior leaders of the United Democratic Front, and Vusi Khanyile,
chairman of the National Education Crisis Committee.
   All had been held more than a year without charge when they
slipped away from guards while undergoing physiotherapy at a
Johannesburg hospital. Morobe and Khanyile are black, Valli Moosa
is Indian.
   ``If the state detains or restricts them, it will deepen the
credibility problems of the apartheid regime,'' the congress'
statement said. ``Government repression has not, and will not,
succeed in destroying the strength and mass support of the
democratic movement.''
   U.S. officials have said they would not force the three to leave
despite a policy of not allowing diplomatic premises to be used by
asylum seekers.
   U.S. officials have maintained a low profile during the episode
and the embassy issued no statement Tuesday. The South African
government also had no immediate comment.
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the 28-month-old state of emergency. About
1,000 people are in detention, according to anti-apartheid groups.
   The three escapees have demanded the release of all detainees
and protesting the policy of indefinite detention without trial,
which they described as a form of torture.
   Colleagues of the three criticized U.S. officials for barring
the men from direct contact with the news media.
   An activist who escaped to the consulate Sept. 21, Clifford
Ngcobo, left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment. His
lawyers had allege he was tortured while in custody.

<HEAD>Israeli-American Lobbying Group's Hard Line Comes Under Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three prominent American Jewish groups are
charging that hard-line lobbying for Israel is out of step with
``the consensus of the organized Jewish community.''
   The attack on the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an
influential Washington lobbying group, surfaced in a letter
published Tuesday by The New York Times and verified as accurate.
   A senior official of the committee told The Associated Press
``this whole episode is bound to confuse members of Congress.''
   The committee is the principal pro-Israel lobbying group in
Washington and concentrates its efforts on Congress.
   The attack came from leaders of the American Jewish Committee,
the American Jewish Congress and the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith.
   They disagreed in the letter with AIPAC's opposition to a U.S.
missile sale to Kuwait, an oil-rich Arab country; the lobbying
group's attempt to force the closing of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's mission to the United Nations; and the committee's
campaign to deny a visa to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in the event
he tried to appear before the U.N. General Assembly.
   An AIPAC official who spoke on condition of anonymity from Los
Angeles, where the group was holding a board meeting Tuesday, said
``more consultation is always desirable'' among Jewish groups.
   He said leaders of the committee would meet in Washington with
the critics on Nov. 3.
   The Kuwaiti arms sale was modified but was not blocked by
Congress. A court in New York, agreeing with the State Department,
ruled the PLO office should stay open despite a congressional vote
to close it. So far, Arafat has not indicated he wanted to address
the United Nations.
   AIPAC is one of the most effective lobbying groups in Washington
and organizes support for House and Senate members it finds
friendly to Israel. The committee has nurtured U.S. arms sales to
Israel and the strategic cooperation agreement with the Jewish
state. At the same time, the committee has played a leading role in
persuading Congress to block or trim a number of arms sales to Arab
countries not at peace with Israel.
   The letter called for closer consultation with the American
Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress and the
Anti-Defamation League, which already are represented on AIPAC's
executive committee.
   The letter said in part: ``We believe such consultation and
coordination will help avoid situations in which AIPAC pursues
policies that are at variance with the consensus of the organized
Jewish community, as occurred most recently with respect to the
Kuwaiti arms deal and the PLO mission to the United Nations, and
threatens to occur again with respect to Arafat's possible
forthcoming visit to the United Nations.''

   Former Gov. Jerry Brown has rented an
apartment in the city's Pacific Heights neighborhood so he could be
eligible if he decides to run for chairman of California's
Democratic Party.
   ``I've been in touch with a number of people throught the state
who are encouraging me and who support my candidacy,'' Brown said
earlier this week. But the former governor said he thought it was
premature to formally announce his candidacy now.
   Under the rules of the state's Democratic Party, the
chairmanship switches from Southern California and Northern
California every four years. The current party chairman, Paul
Kelly, is a lawyer in Southern California. His two-year term
expires early in 1989.
   To be eligible to succeed Kelly, Brown had to change his voter's
registration from Southern California to Northern California. He
did that on Oct. 11, the last day to register before the Nov. 8
election.
   Brown was elected governor twice, in 1974 and 1978. In 1982, he
lost a Senate race to Republican Pete Wilson.

<HEAD>Peyote Use OK in Indian Ceremonies, Oregon High Court Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of the hallucinogenic drug peyote in
Indian religious ceremonies is protected by the federal
constitution's guarantee of religious freedom, the state Supreme
Court ruled today.
   The decision involves two former Douglas County drug counselors
who were fired and denied jobless benefits for using peyote during
Native American Church religious ceremonies.
   In today's ruling, the high court expanded its 1986 decision in
which it said denying jobless benefits to the two men violated
their constitutional rights to freely practice their religion.
   The state had appealed the earlier ruling to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which sent it back to the state court for a definitive
ruling on whether peyote could be legally used in religious
ceremonies in Oregon under state criminal law.
   Peyote is a cactus that contains mescaline, a hallucinogenic
drug that's illegal in Oregon. Possession of the drug is a felony.
   Deputy Attorney General Bill Gary, in oral arguments before the
state Supreme Court earlier this year, said the state has
constitutional authority to impose a ban on all uses of peyote.
   Gary also argued that to permit religious use of that drug would
open the door to all kinds of religious drug exemptions to be
claimed in criminal trials.
   The Supreme Court, in today's decision, noted that Oregon laws
against the possession of controlled substances, including peyote,
``make no exception for the sacramental use of peyote.''
   At the same time, the court said that the ``outright prohibition
of good faith religious use of peyote by adult members of the
Native American Church would violate the First Amendment directly
and as interpreted by Congress.''
   The ruling involved Alfred Smith and Galen Black, who were fired
from their jobs with the Roseburg-based Douglas County Council on
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment for using peyote at
religious ceremonies.
   Smith and Black were denied unemployment benefits on grounds
that they lost their jobs because of misconduct. The council's
rules forbid the use of alcohol or illegal drugs.
   Sueanne Lovendahl, a Roseburg lawyer representing the two men,
argued that the use of peyote in the Indian church is tightly
controlled and that its use outside the church is a sacrilege.

<HEAD>Giant Shrimp Found In Waters From S.C. To Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists and shrimpers are closely
watching to see how some giant shrimp that escaped from a South
Carolina research facility will affect the native crop.
   The shrimp, scientifically called the Penaeus monodon but
carrying nicknames such as the giant tiger, have been found in
commercial nets from Georgetown, S.C., to St. Augustine, Fla.
   ``This will be very interesting to watch,'' said Dr. Sheldon
Dobkin, a professor of biological sciences at Florida Atlantic
University. ``But certainly it is not desirable for exotics to be
loosed on nature, even though this is a nice shrimp.''
   The exotic shrimp, native to the waters of Australia, India and
southeast Asia, weigh up to one-quarter pound each and reportedly
taste good. But some shrimpers are concerned that they might eat
native shrimp and carry contagious diseses.
   Leonard Crosby, a commercial shrimper who manages the Bryan
County Fisherman's Coop on the Georgia coast, said boats docking at
his facility have landed about 15 of the giant tigers since August.
   Crosby said he notified researchers with the University of
Georgia's Marine Extension Center in Brunswick because he wanted
more information about the alien shrimp.
   Officials of the Waddell Mariculture Center in Bluffton, S.C.,
from which the shrimp escaped, said the giant tigers were certified
disease-free by the Hawaiian hatchery that supplied them.
   Paul Christian, a biologist with the Marine Extension Center who
began documenting catches and doing research on the giant tigers in
August, said the imported shrimp are not as inclined to eat their
own kind as native white shrimp.
   Manager Steve Hopkins said the Waddell center imported more than
700,000 quarter-inch tiger shrimp this spring and used them to
stock three artificial ponds on the South Carolina coast, including
a pond at the Bluffton facility, where researchers conduct
mariculture experiments.
   Although the center and private mariculture operations have
successfully raised imported Pacific ocean shrimp in their ponds in
past years, this was the first year any of the giant tiger shrimp
were brought to the Atlantic coast, he said.
   At the Bluffton center, fine-mesh screens were installed in the
floodgates of dikes surrounding the pond to prevent the shrimp from
migrating to tidal waters, Hopkins said.
   ``But the shrimp apparently went around the screens,'' he said.
Hopkins said he has no idea how many of the 100,000 shrimp
initially stocked in the center's pond found their way to open
waters.
   Hopkins first realized that some of the giant shrimp had escaped
when a few showed up in a drainage canal leading from the pond to a
tidal waterway, he said.
   ``Then we got a call in late July from a shrimp boat captain who
said he had an odd-looking shrimp,'' Hopkins said.

<HEAD>Voters in Washington State To Decide Rival Toxic Waste Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are dueling with
business and the Legislature in Washington state over rival ballot
measures that each side claims is the best way to clean up toxic
waste sites.
   Environmental groups back Initiative 97 which would give the
state Department of Ecology unilateral authority to order a site
cleaned up, impose stiff fines and pursue criminal sanctions
against polluters who balked.
   But rival ballot measure 97B, backed by the business community
and most state legislators, would allow polluters time to negotiate
a clean-up plan.
   Supporters say 97B's strength is it permits the state and
industry to clean up sites together, with industry bearing most of
the expense. If 97B passes, it will affirm a toxic waste cleanup
statute enacted a year ago.
   Initiative 97 would raise an estimated $63.4 million to $68
million through a seven-tenths of 1 percent tax on toxic
substances, including gasoline and other refined oil products.
   Measure 97B would raise an estimated $51 million to $56 million
by means of a eight-tenths of 1 percent tax on hazardous
substances. This tax also would apply to refined oil products, but
unlike Initiative 97, would exempt refined products exported to
other states.
   The bulk of revenues generated by either measure would go
towards pay overhead, administration and enforcement of the law,
state officials said.
   Backers of each measure, which will be on Nov. 8 ballots, claim
that theirs is tougher on polluters.
   ``The 97B proposal creates a set of bureaucratic hoops through
which liable persons can make DOE jump before it can get a site
cleaned up,'' said William Ryan, a Boston-based specialist on toxic
waste clean-up laws. ``No other state (with toxic waste clean-up
laws) has such a convoluted response as that of the 97B proposal.''
   But supporters of 97B argue that the law's cooperative approach
is its strength and the reason that, ultimately, it is tougher than
97.
   Sen. Mike Kreidler, D-Olympia, who helped draft the measure
before it became law at a special legislative session a year ago,
said 97B envisions that polluters themselves will pay more than 70
percent of negotiated clean-up costs, while only a small part of
the cost will come from the law's special tax on possessors of
hazardous substances.
   Initiative 97, meanwhile, would rely on a similar tax as its
primary source of clean-up funding, Kreidler contended, even though
expected revenues would not begin to cover the estimated $1 billion
to $2 billion needed to cleanse as many as 400 waste sites in the
state.
   Initiative 97, Kreidler said, assumes that the Department of
Ecology will ``use the (tax) fund for clean up, and then litigate
to recover the costs.'' He said litigation to recover the balance
would mean costly delays at best and possibly no money at the end.
   David Bricklin, a main spokesman for the Initiative 97 campaign
and president of the Washington Environmental Council, countered
that Initiative 97 ``also relies heavily on voluntary clean-ups. It
is just that ours has a significant stick attached to it to ensure
that responsible parties step forward to clean up the sites without
forcing the state to go to court.''
   Supporters of 97B, led by aerospace, oil and timber interests,
have raised $800,000 for their highly visible campaign featuring
billboards, mass mailings and TV advertising.
   Initiative 97 backers, meanwhile, have raised only $196,000, and
campaigners acknowledge that 97B's greater financial resources put
their initiative at a disadvantage.
   Despite the heated debate, some here believe that either measure
would leave the state with a sound toxic waste policy.
   ``We are not at a crossroads in state environmental policy,''
said Jeffrey Goltz, a Seattle lawyer and former head of the state
Ecology Division of the attorney general's office.
   ``What is left for voters to decide this November are relatively
minimal modifications of the approach the legislature already
adopted,'' he said. ``Either the initiative or the alternative
would establish a sound, pro-environment toxic waste policy for the
state, without undue burden on industry.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis' lead in West
Virginia has vanished as Vice President George Bush gains support
among young voters and Democrats, according to a poll released
Tuesday.
   Bush, the Republican nominee, had trailed Dukakis in the state
by 13 percentage points in a poll released the week of Labor Day.
   But the latest poll shows Bush with a 44 percent to 40 percent
lead over his Democratic rival, with 16 percent undecided. Bush's
lead falls within the 4 percent margin of error, meaning the race
could be even.
   Bush's lead is biggest _ 57 percent to 29 percent _ among voters
18 to 24 years old. Dukakis fares best among voters 45 to 54, where
he leads the Republican nominee 46 percent to 35 percent.
   Bush was supported by 27 percent of the self-identified
Democrats polled, up from 19 percent in the Labor Day poll.
   The West Virginia Poll was conducted for The Associated Press,
Charleston Daily Mail and WSAZ-TV by Ryan-Samples Research Inc.
Results are based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 11-13 with
485 likely voters selected at random.

   Michael Jackson fans can get something to remember
the rock superstar by when he comes here in December, a jewelry
firm said Tuesday.
   Ginza Yamazaki will put 54,000 platinum, gold and silver
commemorative medallions on sale Oct. 31, a company spokesman said.
They cost $37 to $1,958.
   ``This is said to be Michael's last concert tour, so we wanted
to give fans who can't go to the concerts a chance to have a memory
of the tour,'' said Yoshio Yamamoto.
   Jackson's manager, Frank Dileo, said in Tokyo last month the
singer might retire from the concert circuit after his nine Tokyo
performances Dec. 9-26.
   Ginza Yamazaki, Japan's largest maker of gold jewelry, produced
500 one-ounce and 3,000 five-gram platinum medals, 500 one-ounce
gold medals, and 50,000 15-gram silver medals, Yamamoto said.
   They contain a profile of Jackson, his signature and the words
``Let's be friends.'' Yamamoto said the design was personally
approved by Jackson.

   The Amazing Kreskin, a nightclub performer
and mentalist, is promising to re-create the fictional War of the
Worlds during the 50th anniversary celebration in the location
named in Orson Welles' broadcast.
   Kreskin said Monday he is working out the details, but he
promised the re-creation will not stir up the kind of panic that
followed the original 1938 Mercury Theatre broadcast.
   ``I'm going to recreate the War of the Worlds and make it really
happen,'' Kreskin said. ``People will experience the War of the
Worlds as it was experienced years ago.''
   Kreskin said his performance would be Oct. 29 during a four-day
celebration of the broadcast's anniversary. A bronze relief will be
dedicated at Grover's Mill, the hamlet where Orson Welles' invading
Martians supposedly landed.
   Planned events for the weekend include panel discussions on such
subjects as Earthlings and travel to Mars, planetarium and laser
shows, and fireworks.

Tuesday during a busy second day of her five-day visit to Spain,
the first ever by a reigning British monarch.
   The Queen told a joint session of parliament the two countries

   Developer Donald J. Trump is selling the St.
Moritz Hotel in Manhattan to Australian billionaire entrepreneur
Alan Bond, winner of the 1983 America's Cup sailing race and owner
of the world's fourth-largest brewery.
   Trump and a Bond representative said Monday the selling price
was $180 million. Trump said he bought the hotel on the south end
of Central Park for $31 million in 1985.
   Trump, whose net worth was estimated last week by Forbes
magazine at $1 billion, said the St. Moritz made him an average
yearly profit of $12.5 million.
   Sale of the 775-room elegant hotel comes on the heels of Trump's
agreement last week to buy the Eastern Air Shuttle for $365 million.
   But the developer said he was not selling property to raise cash.
   ``I don't want to have two hotels on the same block,'' he
explained. He bought the Plaza Hotel down the street from the St.
Moritz earlier this year.

   American actor-director Charlton Heston,
playwright Herman Wouk and an all-Chinese cast got a standing
ovation Tuesday night at the Chinese debut of Wouk's play ``The
Caine Mutiny Court Martial.''
   ``I am very, very happy tonight and very grateful,'' said a
beaming Heston, who used a translator and sign language to direct
the Chinese cast at the People's Art Theater of Beijing.
   Wouk added his thanks to ``the Chinese people who have taken my
work to their hearts.'' His Pulitzer-winning novel on which the
play was based recently was translated into Chinese.
   The play depticts the World War II court martial and acquittal
of a U.S. Navy officer, Stephen Maryk, who mutinied against his
tyrannical and mentally unstable commander, Captain Queeg. The
audience of more than 1,000 Chinese and foreigners frequently
interrupted with applause.
   The role of Queeg was played by one of China's leading actors,
Zhu Xu, who last played China's last emperor, Pu Yi, in a 28-year
television series. Heston played Queeg in more than 250
performances of the ``Caine Mutiny'' in the United States.
   Heston said the play will run in Beijing ``as long as people
will come to see it.''

   An emaciated five-ton whale was stuck
in a shallow bay off Long Island today, and adverse weather forced
conservationists to postpone plans to pull the 17-foot mammal into
the Atlantic Ocean.
   The adolescent Minke whale wandered into Peconic Bay last week,
said Sam Sadove of the Okeanos Research Foundation in Hampton Bays.
   The Coast Guard and foundation researchers had hoped to harness
the whale to two boats today and tow it through Shinnecock Canal
and Shinnecock Bay into the Atlantic, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Steve Dowd.
   But Pat Logan, an administrative assistant at the foundation,
said winds in the inlet forced researchers to cancel the towing
attempt for today and will likely force a postponement until
Thursday.
   Earlier plans to rescue the animal were suspended Monday when
whale-watchers said they hadn't seen the mammal since dusk Sunday
night and there was no signal from a radio transmitter that was
placed on it Saturday, Sadove said.
   But a plane sent up by the foundation sighted the whale around
3:30 p.m. Monday, he said.
   The whale was discovered by boaters in Sag Harbor two weeks ago
and moved into the shallow waters of Peconic last week. This is the
first whale sighted in the bay, according to Okeanos' records,
which go back to 1880.
   About the time the whale was spotted in Sag Harbor, three
California gray whales became trapped near Barrow, Alaska. A rescue
operation for those whales was in progress today.

<HEAD>West Germany Hopes to Increase Trading Role With Soviet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany hopes to launch major new
economic initiatives in the Soviet Union to cash in on ambitious
plans to overhaul its economy, officials said Tuesday.
   A $1.6 billion West German credit to the Kremlin signed this
week has buoyed optimism among businesses in this staunch NATO ally.
   ``We believe that West Germany can play a leading role in making
modernization possible in the Soviet Union,'' said Reinhard Krause,
an Economics Ministry spokesman.
   West Germany has long enjoyed good economic relations with
Moscow, and remains its biggest Western trading partner despite
declines in recent years.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms have
fueled interest in establishing closer economic and political ties,
Krause told The Associated Press.
   Officials in Bonn see broadening opportunities for more joint
ventures and for increased West German participation in the
consumer and supply sectors.
   West German firms are involved in 13 joint ventures in the
Soviet Union, and 35 more are under negotiation.
   ``The Soviet Union is clearly interested in quickly improving
the quality of consumer services to its citizens,'' Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said.
   ``This is a political opportunity that could lead to many new
contracts with West German firms,'' Stoltenberg said after meeting
with industrialists in Berlin.
   The West German enthusiasm in the economic sphere is matched by
a growing positive public perception of Gorbachev and his reforms.
   According to a poll released by the Munich-based Sinus Institute
on Tuesday, 84 percent of West Germans think positively about
Gorbachev, 41 percent said they like the Soviets, and 51 percent
judged his reforms positively.
   Important groundwork for expanding West German trade with the
Soviet Union was laid Monday with the signing of the $1.6 billion
credit agreement, the biggest foreign credit ever extended by West
German banks.
   Deutsche Bank AG, which heads the consortium of banks, signed
the agreement with Moscow's Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs. The
credit line was set up to finance West German exports primarily in
the food, leather, textile and clothing sectors.
   West German economic officials hope to expand well beyond those
areas.
   An Economics Ministry report said that the Soviet Union holds
the potential for a ``wide field of economic cooperation and export
opportunities'' in the areas of agriculture, energy, environmental
techonology, medical equipment and light and heavy machinery.
   The report said the Soviets have drawn up a list of German firms
they are interested in dealing with.
   ``There is enormous potential here,'' said Peter Pietsch, a
finance and trade expert at Frankfurt's Commerzbank.
   ``The Soviet Union has tremendous market potential for West
Germany and other Western nations,'' Pietsch said. ``By helping the
Soviet Union modernize now, we can create the climate and
conditions for an even larger trade market in future.''
   Economic ties will top the agenda in talks in Moscow next week
between Gorbachev and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   In addition to negotiations for more joint ventures, West
Germany hopes to reach agreements in projects ranging from
developing the mineral-rich Kola peninsula in the northwestern
Soviet Union to the construction of factories.
   Economics Ministry officials also say 12 West German companies
will sign agreements with the Soviet Union. The companies
specialize in producing packaging machines, furniture processing
equipment and truck products.
   The news weekly Der Spiegel said an agreement would be signed
for West German companies to set up a trade center in Moscow.
   Trade between West Germany and the Soviet Union dropped from
$10.30 billion in 1986 to $8.30 billion in 1987, but the Economics
Ministry said total trade volume is expected to stabilize at that
level this year.

   Israeli troops today shot and killed two
Palestinians _ a teen-ager and a 5-year-old boy _ and wounded an
American photographer during clashes with Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank city of Nablus.
   The wounded American was identified by doctors at Nablus' Al
Ittihad Hospital as Neal Cassidy, a 37-year-old free-lance
photographer from Oakland, Calif. Doctors said he was hit in the
right knee by a plastic bullet.
   Cassidy was the first foreign journalist to be wounded in the
10-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and occupied
Gaza Strip.
   Hospital officials identified the dead teen-ager as Khaled
Tbaileh, 14, of Nablus. Officials at St. John Hospital in Nablus
said he was shot in the chest.
   The 5-year-old boy died at Al Ittihad Hospital after being shot
in the chest, stomach and left arm as he played in a schoolyard,
hospital officials said.
   The boy, identified as Deyaa Fayez, was shot when Israeli
soldiers opened fire on youths who threw stones at their patrol car
from the schoolyard, Arab reporters said.
   Doctors said both Palestinians were killed by plastic bullets.
   The deaths brought to 301 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 10-month-old uprising in the territories seized by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East war. Six Israelis also have died.
   An army spokesman confirmed the two deaths. The army also
confirmed that Cassidy was wounded.
   Nablus' central market area has been the site of repeated
clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops. An Arab journalist
said the troops opened fire today after Palestinians threw stones.
   Cassidy was on assignment in Israel for the biweekly
Oakland-based newspaper Frontline, said Phyllis Bennis, a writer
for the publication. He also works for Impact Visuals, a photo
agency in New York, she said.
   Ms. Bennis, 37, of New York City, said Cassidy was standing near
the entrance to the central market ``near a group of young men
chanting and banging on doors.'' She said a group of Israeli
soldiers was about 150 yards away.
   Ms. Bennis said Cassidy told her: ``Suddenly, without warning,
the soldiers began firing.''
   She said she did not see the shooting.
   Ms. Bennis said doctors told Cassidy that because the bullet was
imbedded in soft tissue above the knee, removing it would cause
more damage. ``So they will clean the entrance wound and keep him
on antibiotics in the hospital for three days to prevent
infection,'' she said.
   A spokesman for the U.S. consul said, ``The consulate will seek
to contact Mr. Cassidy as promptly as possible. We are concerned
about the safety and welfare of Americans.''
   The Israeli army introduced plastic bullets last August to
supplement rubber bullets, tear gas and lead bullets in quelling
riots. Injuries have soared, and the use of the new ammunition has
drawn criticism from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency as well as
the United States, Britain and Egypt.
   Plastic bullets are not usually lethal if fired from a distance
of more than 70 yards. The government says they were issued to give
soldiers an alternative to firing lead bullets.
   Ms. Bennis said she and Cassidy have been in Israel for three
weeks working on a story about Palestinian life. Officials at the
Government Press Office in Jerusalem said they had no record of
Cassidy being accredited to work in Israel.

   Stella Goldberg also named the convicted killer, Darrell Van
Mastright, in her lawsuit, filed Monday in Allegheny County court.
   Mrs. Goldberg claimed that both the university and the
fraternity failed to curb the consumption of alcohol and the
smoking of marijuana by students at the party that preceded her
daughter's death.
   After a non-jury trial before Common Pleas Court Judge Robert E.
Dauer, Van Mastright, 19, was found guilty of first-degree murder
in the Feb. 8, 1987, killing of Jeanne Goldberg, 20, a student at
Robert Morris College.
   Van Mastright is serving a life sentence at the State
Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh.
   Testimony during Van Mastright's trial showed that he was
introduced to Goldberg on the Carnegie Mellon campus. They attended
an off-campus party at Delta Tau Delta, where they drank liquor and
smoked marijuana, according to testimony.
   In her suit, Mrs. Goldberg claimed the university and the
fraternity abdicated their ``parental responsibilities'' by failing
to restrict the consumption of alcohol and drugs by students,
particularly those under 21.
   The stabbing would not have occurred, the suit contended, if Van
Mastright ``had not been crazed by the large amount of alcohol,
combined with the quantity of marijuana.''
   Among the damages Mrs. Goldberg is seeking is what her daughter
might have earned had she fulfilled her ambition of becoming an FBI
agent.

   Israel's Supreme Court today barred the
anti-Arab Kach movement of American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane from
running in the Nov. 1 election, saying it was racist and
undemocratic.
   But the high court permitted an Arab-Jewish party that calls for
an independent Palestinian state to remain in the race.
   Police ordered silence among 50 singing supporters of the Kach
Party. Judge Menachem Eilon then read out the terse decision,
saying ``the appeal is rejected.''
   The panel of five judges later released a 27-page judgment on
the appeal in which they wrote that ``the aims of Kach and its
actions are racist and that it seeks to violently deny the rights
... of segments of the population.''
   The high court ruled 3-2 that the Progressive List for Peace
could remain in the race. The Arab-Jewish party calls for direct
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization and an independent
Palestinian alongside Israel.
   The appeal to the court from the right-wing Likud bloc and the
Tehiya party came after it had been rejected by the Elections
Committee. The rightist parties argued the Progressive List for
Peace should be ousted on grounds that it sought the destruction of
Israel as a Jewish state.
   Polls say Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud and the
left-leaning Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres are in a
close race in the Nov. 1 election.
   The Brooklyn-born Kahane, 56, told a news conference that the
unanimous court decision to bar his party was undemocratic.
   ``In Judaism, there is no democracy,'' said Kahane, who was
thronged by dozens of supporters, some wearing yellow T-shirts with
the party emblem, a clenched fist inside a Star of David.
   Kahane urged his supporters to boycott the elections.
   His ouster was expected to strengthen right-wing parties and
might give Likud the election advantage. Likud had said it would
not form a coalition with Kahane because of its racist policies.
   Kahane has called for the expulsion of the 1.5 million Arabs
living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as the
700,000 Arabs residing within Israel's borders.
   The Central Elections Committee said the demand was racist, and
banned the party Oct. 5 under a new law barring racist parties from
running for office.
   Kahane appealed that ruling.
   Kahane immigrated to Israel in 1971 after founding the Jewish
Defense League, a militant organization blamed for attacks on Arabs
and other opponents of Israel in the United States.
   Also today, Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian
teen-ager and a 5-year-old boy and wounded an American photographer
in clashes in the West Bank city of Nablus.
   The army confirmed the deaths and the wounding of American Neal
Cassidy, 37, of Oakland, Calif.
   Doctors at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital said Cassidy was hit in
the right knee by a plastic bullet.
   The deaths brings to 301 the number of Arabs killed since the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied lands
began Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died.

   Coverage of the presidential election by sound
bite isn't serving the public, but what the news media is dishing
out appears to be what the public wants, new CBS News President
David Burke said Tuesday.
   Burke, appearing before television critics for the first time
since he moved over from ABC News in July, said he did not know how
to steer the public's attention, and thus the news media's, away
from glib quotes and flashy images and onto important issues.
   ``I sort of sense an unwanting to know among the public. I mean,
the public is buying the flag factories and Pledge of Allegiance
and card-carrying this and card-carrying that,'' said Burke.
   ``I suppose we haven't done our job well if we don't keep
beating on them that they shouldn't be paying attention to that,
they should be paying attention to other things.
   ``I fault us, I expect, for being members of this same public
and not being willing to put on the hair shirt and say, `Sit down,
we're going to talk to you about the federal deficit.'''
   Burke, 52, is the first outsider to head CBS News. He had been
at ABC News for 11 years and had served as executive vice president
since 1986. Before entering the news business, Burke worked in
Democratic politics, as secretary to former New York Gov. Hugh
Carey in the 1970s, and in the 1960s as administrative assistant to
U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Burke said he supported ``CBS Evening News'' anchor Dan Rather's
decision not to serve as a panelist on the second presidential
debate, calling the forum ``contrived.''
   ABC's Peter Jennings was a panelist on the first presidential
debate in September and NBC's Tom Brokaw was one of the questioners
for the vice presidential debate earlier this month.
   Burke said the League of Women Voters was right to withdraw its
sponsorship of the second presidential debate because of the
numerous restrictions insisted upon by each candidate.
   ``Those debates were a contrivance,'' Burke said. ``... He
(Rather) was uncomfortable with it, I was terribly uncomfortable
with it. ... I think it was the right decision, absolutely the
right decision.''
   As far as CBS News' regular programming, Burke indicated strong
devotion to ``CBS This Morning,'' the 11-month-old morning talk
show, and to ``48 Hours,'' a prime-time documentary series that
premiered last season.
   He hedged on the future of ``West 57th,'' the on-again,
off-again newsmagazine that has languished in a Saturday night time
period since last season. But the news division has no alternative
time period to suggest, and the network is not anxious to replace
it with more expensive entertainment programming, Burke said.
   ``It's not in stone,'' he said. ```48 Hours' is in stone. The
morning is in stone.''

   The State Department said Tuesday it would be
``extremely concerned'' if the Sudan accepted flood relief
assistance from a Palestinian group in return for the release of
suspected Palestinian terrorists in Sudanese custody.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman said he could not confirm
reports that Abu Nidal, whose group is held responsible for scores
of terrorist attacks, has sent $4 million in flood relief to the
Sudan.
   But Redman said the United States ``would be extremely concerned
if any donation were accepted in return for the release or lenient
sentencing of suspected terrorists.
   ``Such arrangements would be likely to encourage further
terrorist attacks,'' he said.
   According to a published report, five Palestinians said to have
worked for Abu Nidal are scheduled to be sentenced in Khartoum for
attacks in that city.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater today
said ``there is no legal problem'' with Nancy Reagan's practice of
borrowing expensive gowns and jewels over the last five years.
   At the same time, the No. 2 man at the Office of Government
Ethics said his agency sees no need at this time to reassess its
1982 opinion concluding that such reporting was not required under
the Ethics in Government Act.
   At his daily White House news briefing, Fitzwater said, ``There
are a lot of questions and we believe all the questions have been
answered satisfactorily.''
   ``As far as we're concerned, there is no consequence'' for
President Reagan's financial disclosure forms and tax forms, the
spokesman said.
   ``There is no legal problem. There is no ethical problem,'' he
added.
   On Monday, Donald Campbell, deputy director of the Office of
Government Ethics, said that office in 1982 had concurred with an
opinion by White House legal counsel Fred Fielding that Mrs. Reagan
was not technically required to list the gowns as loans on her
husband's financial disclosure form.
   Campbell said today that ``at this time, there is no belief here
in the office that the decision was not the correct one.''
   Campbell also said, however, that ``if there's any indication of
any error that we made in the past, we clearly would take another
look at it.''
   Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, denied that
Mrs. Reagan has kept any of the expensive items she obtained from
designers and jewelers. She said in a statement late Monday that
``Mrs. Reagan regrets that she failed to heed'' the advice of White
House counsel in 1982 to report such transactions, but that this
was not technically required under the Ethics in Government Act.
   Today Mrs. Crispen said of the first lady:
   ``Basically, she set her own little rule. She made a promise not
to do this again and she broke her little promise because she just
didn't feel she had to do it (disclose the transactions).''
   The spokeswoman noted Monday that the Office of Government
Ethics had ruled in 1982 that ``loans of apparel to Mrs. Reagan
need not be reported on the president's financial disclosure forms.
No paid-for apparel need be reported on any forms,'' the
spokeswoman's statement said.
   Campbell said the issue was first raised in 1982, when
then-White House counsel Fred Fielding sent a letter to the ethics
office detailing the situation at the time.
   Campbell said Fielding concluded that this ``was not something
that needed to be reported'' on Reagan's financial disclosure form.
The forms are required under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.
   J. Jackson Walter, then-director of the ethics office, agreed
with Fielding's conclusion at the time, Campbell said, adding that
Mrs. Reagan has been operating under that guidance since then.
   Mrs. Crispen said Mrs. Reagan did report such transactions
anyway on her husband's form in 1982, about six months after the
question arose. She said the first lady decided at the time ``to
err on the side'' of compliance but acknowledged that Mrs. Reagan
stopped reporting the loans thereafter.
   Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman said the first lady has not kept any
of the numerous dresses and outfits loaned to her by designers.
   ``To a typical woman, there are some gowns that are so
spectacular that you would only wear it once,'' she said.
   ``The apparel Mrs. Reagan received was either paid for, given to
her personally as gifts by old friends, and not subject to
reporting, or loaned to her and returned,'' she said.
   Campbell said, however, that any time a question is raised about
a decision by the ethics office, a review process is triggered, and
that such a reassessment will take place in this instance.
   The matter of Mrs. Reagan's use of expensive, borrowed clothes
was raised in the current edition of Time magazine. It said she
continued to accept and wear expensive evening gowns and other
outfits furnished by leading couturiers such as James Galanos and
David Hayes after saying she would discontinue the practice.
   Chris Blazakis, a former business associate of Galanos, said he
has identified more than 300 photographs of Mrs. Reagan since 1982
in which she is wearing outfits worth more than $1 million total.
   Los Angeles designer Hayes told Time that Mrs. Reagan has kept
some of the 60 to 80 made-to-order outfits she borrowed during the
past eight years.
   ``We think of it as loans. It's wonderful,'' Hayes said. ``She
has been a sensation for my business.''
   The Time article included pictures of Mrs. Reagan wearing
expensive gowns while posing with, among others, French President
Francois Mitterrand and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The
article said she borrowed gowns ranging in value to as high as
$22,000 for one such outfit.
   Mrs. Crispen said that ``for any first lady, there have been
mounds of things that you have to go to, and you have to borrow,
and it's not illegal.''
   ``I think she has made Americans so proud'' of the way she has
represented them at official events, the press secretary said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described Reagan as
``upset over these attacks'' on the first lady. He said that no
internal review had been commenced in the wake of the Time report,
saying ``I don't know that there needs to be one.''
   Reagan's presidential salary is $200,000 a year, and his 1987
tax form disclosed modest income that Mrs. Reagan had received in
talent fees and residuals from appearances on network television
shows, but no information about her clothing.

<HEAD>Police Employee Suspended After Tow Truck Hits 17 Cars</HEAD>

   A police department driver was jailed
awaiting arraignment Tuesday on charges he went on a 60 mph rampage
with his tow truck, ramming 17 cars, pushing them into rowhouses
and injuring at least five people. Elbert Hatten, 36, a six-year
civilian employee, was suspended from the department with intent to
dismiss after the Monday night incident, said police spokeswoman
Cpl. Theresa Young.
   Hatten was charged with being an intoxicated chauffeur, four
counts of reckless endangerment and three counts of simple assault,
Ms. Young said. Hatten was on duty but had no assignments in the
area, and police had no motive, she said.
   ``I'm not giving out any information,'' a woman who answered the
phone at Hatten's house said Tuesday before hanging up.
   A number of residents tried to stop the truck before a man
turned off the ignition, police and witnesses said.
   The truck was moving about 60 mph when it started hitting
vehicles and pushing them into the front porches of two-story
rowhouses in north Philadelphia, said Angel Echevarria, 17.
   ``It was ridiculous,'' said witness Carmen Rivera. ``He was a
humongous man and he kept trying to drive away. And when he
couldn't drive anymore, he tried to fight his way out. He was
hitting all these people _ it was not even funny.''
   Ms. Rivera said the driver sideswiped two cars by a tire shop,
backed up, then drove hard up the street, hitting a van and pushing
it into a porch.
   As neighbors began to crowd around, the driver again backed up
and gunned the engine, scraped more cars, backed up again and
finally stopped when it hit another car.
   ``He had no bumper and the motor went out, so then he wanted to
get out of the truck and leave,'' Ms. Rivera said. ``He kept
punching people. He broke a guy's lip. So then the people started
getting mad and hitting him.''
   It was the second time in five weeks that a driver crashed into
multiple vehicles on Philadelphia streets.
   On Sept. 13, a mystery driver hit more than 30 cars on seven
blocks in the city's Holmesburg section and escaped on foot.
   No arrests have been made in that case, which is still under
investigation, Cpl. Glenn Carp said Tuesday.
   Ms. Young said the two cases are not believed to be related.

   Flooding caused by Hurricane Joan left
about 50 people dead or missing in a northern town in Colombia, an
official with the state of Bolivar said Tuesday.
   Water roared down three gullies in the town of Carmen de Bolivar
on Monday as the hurricane passed over northern Colombia, the
administrative assistant for the state government, Victor Leon
Mendoza, said in a broadcast interview.
   Carmen de Bolivar is 360 miles north of the capital of Bogota.
   ``Preliminary reports from the mayor's office indicate that
about 50 persons are dead or missing'' in the town, Leon Mendoza
told the Colombian radio chain RCN.
   The weather service said the storm buffeted northern Colombia
with heavy rain and winds of about 65 mph on Monday before heading
northwest into the Caribbean toward the island of San Andres and
the coast of Nicaragua and Honduras.

   Eight snakes snatched from their zoo cages were
returned unharmed in cloth sacks, but the reptile rustlers who kept
them over the weekend slid into hiding, police said.
   Juveniles were apparently keeping the two boa constrictors and
six pythons from the Dallas Zoo at a house in a Dallas suburb,
authorities said. But before police could follow up on a tip, the
snakenappers left the dwelling.
   Jim Murphy, a curator, said he was at the zoo Monday evening
when a father and son came into the office and said the boy had
something he wanted to return. The snakes, worth an estimated
$8,000, were in cloth sacks, he said.
   No arrests have been made in the case.
   ``We're just relieved they're back,'' said Murphy, referring to
the six pythons and two boas.
   Zoo director Warren Iliff said the snakes were taken from their
cages in a work area at the zoo between 5 p.m. Friday and 11 a.m.
Saturday. Workers found no signs of forced entry, and lids still
covered the snakes' cages, some of which were found latched.
   ``I don't know how they could have gotten them,'' Iliff said.
``We have to make sure it doesn't happen again.''
   Iliff said none of the snakes is poisonous, but whoever took
them would have needed some knowledge of reptiles to pull off the
heist.
   The snakes did not appear to have been abused or neglected,
Iliff and Murphy said.
   The theft of the boas especially worried zoo officials, said
spokeswoman Victoria Furber. The two snakes came from Madagascar
and are listed as an endangered species because their forest
habitat is being destroyed.

   They cast 231 ballots trying to elect a
mayor, but the acting mayor and City Council finally gave up early
Tuesday and went home to bed.
   ``I think the people of Westover deserve better than what we're
providing,'' said Councilman Thomas Talerico before the five-member
City Council and Acting Mayor Mary C. Koon gave up trying to elect
a replacement for former Mayor Francis Teter Sr., who resigned last
month.
   The council and Koon adjourned their meeting early Tuesday after
failing to break a 3-3 deadlock between Koon and Donald Roderick, a
town Sewer Board member.
   Koon, 53, and Roderick, 57, were among eight applicants for the
job.
   During the nearly six-hour meeting, Koon and Talerico had a
showdown over Koon's right to vote for herself.
   State law says that ``no member of the governing body of any
municipality shall vote upon any ordinance, order, measure,
resolution or proposition, in which he may be interested other than
as a citizen of such municipality.''
   Citing the statute, Talerico said Koon should not be able to
vote because she would receive a hefty pay increase if elected
mayor. Koon is paid $1,500 annually as the town's recorder. The
town's mayor receives $10,000 annually.
   ``I contend that you, Lottie Koon, have an $8,500 interest in
who becomes mayor of Westover,'' said Talerico, who drew a chorus
of groans, hoots and catcalls with the statement.
   Koon said the Secretary of State ruled she had a right to vote.
Talerico argued that only the state attorney general could make
such a ruling. Koon countered that she had consulted with that
office, too.
   The council and Koon will try to break the deadlock next Monday
night.

<TEXT>
   Iraq's effective use of chemical weapons against
Iran is likely to encourage other countries to acquire them, and
Libya and Syria probably have already done so, according to a
report released Tuesday.
   The International Institute for Strategic Studies said Israel
and Egypt may also have secret arsenals of nerve agents and other
chemical weapons.
   In its annual survey, the London-based institute also said
Soviet conventional forces remain poised for swift attack, with no
sign of a winding down or switching to defensive positions despite
talk of change since Mikhail S. Gorbachev took office.
   In the past year, the numerical superiority of the Warsaw Pact's
conventional forces over those of the NATO alliance has, if
anything, increased, the survey said.
   But the institute said a raw count of weapons and manpower _
including a 2-1 Warsaw Pact advantage in main battle tanks _ was
too simplistic to judge which side really has the edge.
   The report refused to offer any overall judgment of the state of
the NATO-Warsaw Pact conventional balance.
   In long-range nuclear weapons, a six-percent increase by both
superpowers to some 14,600 American and 11,700 Soviet warheads left
them equally matched. ``Despite this numerical disparity, we judge
that equivalent strategic parity remains,'' said institute deputy
director Col. John Cross.
   The survey was gloomiest about chemical weapons.
   It said the Soviet Union could attack the entire NATO area with
chemical and biological weapons sprayed from aircraft or delivered
by missiles, free-fall bombs or artillery shells.
   It also indicated that Iraq's use of mustard gas and other nerve
agents likely served as an advertisement, particularly in Third
World countries, for the weapons, which have been condemned
internationally as inhuman.
   ``The role of chemical warfare in the Iran-Iraq war ... is more
likely to be seen as an encouragement to the future use of chemical
weapons in other regional conflicts, than as a discouragement,''
the survey said.
   Institute director Francois Heisbourg said unless an
international conference in Paris next year bolsters a 1925
protocol banning chemical weapons in any war, more countries will
acquire them.
   The protocol has been undermined by use of chemical weapons in
the Persian Gulf war and by Iraq using them against Kurdish rebels
this year.
   Attempts to get a global ban on such weapons are stalled.
   ``Unless the authority of the protocol is internationally
reaffirmed ... I suspect that other countries which theoretically
could produce chemical weapons will be tempted to do so,'' said
Heisbourg.
   ``Syria and Libya are strongly suspected,'' he added. ``Egypt
has used chemical weapons against North Yemen in 1966 so there is a
presumption there, while Israel is closing no options ... with the
perceived Syrian threat.''
   Only the United States and the Soviet Union acknowledge having
chemical weapons.
   But the institute said up to 20 more countries, including
France, were suspected of stockpiling or preparing to produce the
weapons.
   The Soviet Union says it has a 50,000-ton chemical weapon
stockpile _ one-sixth of the total estimated by Western analysts.
   The institute supported the United States' resumption last year
of production of binary weapons _ separate agents that are lethal
only when combined, saying that without a global ban ``deterrence
is the only policy for NATO to follow.''
   On Warsaw Pact-NATO conventional forces, the survey showed the
main disparity in battle tanks: 22,200 NATO tanks deployed from the
Atlantic to the Urals, facing 53,000 of the Warsaw Pact. Globally
NATO had 33,600 tanks and the Warsaw Pact 68,900, compared with
30,500 and 68,300 the previous year.
   Soviet conventional forces exceeded defense needs and were
``configured and deployed in a fashion which favors high-speed,
short-warning, offensive (or counteroffensive) operations.''
   Meanwhile, with only France, West Germany and Italy increasing
defense spending in Western Europe, NATO may be hard-pressed to
maintain its present forces, the survey said. ``Any significant
response to U.S. calls for increased European burden-sharing seems
unlikely,''
   The institute also said Argentina and Brazil may now be able to
make nuclear weapons. Four other officially non-nuclear powers _
India, Pakistan, South Africa and Israel _ have long been suspected
of having atomic weapons or being able to produce them.

   A blind, 75-year-old man says a
teen-ager saved his life by rushing into his burning mobile home
and pulling him to safety.
   ``I couldn't get out on my own,'' said Manuel Dennis. ``For one
thing, I'm blind and for another, there was too much heat.''
   Witnesses called the boy a hero, saying that only moments after
the pair escaped, the mobile home burst into flames and blew out
the windows.
   Gary Roy Lawrence, 15, said he doesn't understand all the fuss.
   ``I saw the smoke. I knew he was in there so I got him out. He
was yelling for help,'' said the youth.
   The high school junior, barefoot and shirtless, heard the man's
cries Saturday afternoon while he was walking through 41 Pines
Trailer Park. He saw smoke coming from the trailer where Dennis
lived alone.
   Lawrence said he went to the front door, found a fire
extinguisher and doused the flames in the living room. The
teen-ager could hear the man yelling, but couldn't see him because
of the thick smoke.
   He called for Dennis to come to him, but there was no response.
   Lawrence went to a rear door. It was locked. He punched out a
window, unlocked the door and went back into the trailer.
   ``I grabbed him by the arm and pulled him out,'' Lawrence said.
``He kept saying he wanted to get his shoes, but it was too far
gone to let him back in there.''
   The only injury reported was a minor cut to Lawrence's foot.
   Land O' Lakes Fire Chief Ross Wright said fire trucks arrived
just as the teen-ager came out of the trailer with Dennis. The
blaze was started by careless smoking, Wright said.
   The youth said he learned a little about firefighting from his
father and two of his uncles, all of whom have been volunteer
firefighters.
   ``He did what anybody with common sense would do. He went in
there and got the old boy out,'' said the teen-ager's proud uncle,
Ernest Pearl, a volunteer firefighter at Land O' Lakes.
   Dennis, resettled in another trailer, has another pair of shoes
the teen-ager gave him to replace those he lost in the fire.
   The elderly man is grateful to the youth. ``I knew him when he
was just a little kid; he's always around there somewhere. That
kid's OK.''

<HEAD>Ethics Charges Make R.I. Governor's Race Close</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun was reluctant
to take on Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete again after losing to
him in a landslide two years ago. But now a costly battle over
ethics has turned the race for governor in the nation's tiniest
state into a surprising cliffhanger.
   Sundlun, a multimillionaire communications executive who lost by
a 2-to-1 margin in 1986, has capitalized on news stories about
DiPrete family land deals, about DiPrete administration handling of
a major unfinished bridge project, and about state contracts for
trash hauling and engineering services awarded to DiPrete campaign
contributors.
   Sundlun, who said early private polls showed him as much as 50
points behind, has drawn even and surged ahead in some recent
surveys.
   A telephone survey of 400 likely voters conducted for local
radio and television stations after an Oct. 10 debate between
DiPrete and Sundlun showed the race too close to call, with Sundlun
receiving 40 percent support and DiPrete 38 percent, well within
the poll's 5 percent margin of error. A week earlier, Sundlun had
an 11 percentage point lead.
   ``What I've noticed is that neither candidate has made much of
an inroad into the 15 percent undecided,'' said Sundlun's campaign
manager, Kenneth Haupt. ``From what I've seen, the undecideds break
fairly heavily for the challenger. They want a change. ...
   ``I expect finally, the last week, people will start choosing
sides.''
   Sundlun's support, moreover, remains soft. One poll showed that
about two-thirds of those surveyed said they were voting more
against DiPrete than for Sundlun.
   DiPrete is striking back at Sundlun while trying to steer the
campaign focus to jobs, the economy and education, all areas where
he claims to have brought progress to Rhode Island.
   Sundlun said the state has prospered because of New England's
general economic boom. DiPrete responded that his administration
positioned the state to take advantage of that boom.
   The Nov. 8 election will be ``a referendum on the job I have
done during the past four years,'' DiPrete, who seeks his third
two-year term, said in closing Monday night's second debate between
the pair.
   DiPrete still is considering an offer of a third televised
debate. On Tuesday, he received the endorsement of American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which
represents about 9,000 state workers. The union cited his fairness
and accessibility.
   Sundlun's campaign has hammered at ``the $2 million Cranston
land deal.'' DiPrete, former mayor of Cranston, denied any
wrongdoing after Cranston officials rezoned a piece of property for
apartments and DiPrete's family firm then bought it and sold it the
same day for a $2 million profit.
   But DiPrete launched a television ad in late September, telling
viewers: ``I sense that some of you may believe that I've let you
down. If this is true, then I'm sorry.''
   DiPrete ads charge that Sundlun, chairman of Outlet
Communications Inc., mismanaged that company to a loss; ``ran
(Outlet Stores) into the ground'' before selling it to a company
that later closed the chain; and was involved in the Executive Jet
Aviation scandal of the 1970s that led to the downfall of the Penn
Central Railroad.
   Sundlun denies those charges. ``I have seen my reputation sought
to be destroyed in 30 seconds _ 30-second spots,'' he said.
   The barrage of ads and counter ads is costly. Recent campaign
finance reports show that in September, Sundlun spent $577,000,
incuding about $90,000 per week for televison and radio.
   Sundlun lent his campaign $495,000 during that period and has
provided most of the $1.4 million in loans outstanding, Haupt said.
The campaign had about $10,000 left, but Sundlun was prepared to
loan more, Haupt said.
   From July through mid-October, DiPrete's campaign reported
spending more than $1 million, including more than $100,000 per
week in television and radio ads beginning in September. Most of
his money came from individual and corporate contributions, along
with a $200,000 bank loan.
   Observers agree the race is one of the most expensive in memory
in this state, which has a population of just under 1 million and
is geographically the nation's smallest.

<HEAD>AT&T Plans to Cut Long-Distance Rates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts graf 3, AT&T estimates, with average figure.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. wants to
cut its basic interstate long-distance rates by an average of 3.8
percent and its business service prices by up to 6.2 percent to
reflect savings in local network costs.
   The cuts, totaling $697 million annually, would take effect Dec.
1, the day that residential and small business customers begin
paying an additional 60 cents per month to pay the costs of
maintaining the local phone network.
   AT&T estimates that subscribers who make at least $16 a month in
interstate, long-distance calls would offset the addition of the
subscriber line charge. The average residential customer spends
$8.66 per month on interstate, long-distance calls, the company
said. Those totals do not include intrastate long-distance calls.
   As subscribers pay more of the costs to maintain the local
network, long-distance companies pay less. The Federal
Communications Commission requires AT&T, the nation's largest
long-distance company, to send these savings back to consumers by
lowering rates.
   AT&T's competitors are not required to return these savings to
customers, but the companies have tended to lower their rates in
response to AT&T price cuts.
   The two largest competitors, MCI Communications Corp. and US
Sprint Communications Co., said Monday they would review AT&T's
plans.
   MCI spokesman John Houser said the company ``will maintain a
competitive rate structure'' and ``will be passing the access line
savings along to our customers.'' But he said MCI could not be
specific until it has fully reviewed AT&T's proposal.
   Sprint spokesman Syd Courson said the company wanted to review
AT&T's proposed cuts before commenting on its own plans. ``We don't
know what we will do right now,'' he said.
   The price cut, if approved by the FCC, would be AT&T's seventh
since 1984, when the company was stripped of its local operating
companies by an antitrust decree. Since then, AT&T's rates have
fallen 38 percent.
   Subscribers, however, pay $2.60 per month for local network
costs in a fee called the subscriber line charge, which was first
imposed in 1985 as a way to shift the costs of the local network to
local customers. That charge is scheduled to rise to $3.20 per
month on Dec. 1.
   A consumer advocate, Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation
of America, said he was concerned that AT&T has structured its rate
cut to benefit the company's special discount services designed for
large users.
   As an example, he pointed to AT&T's proposal to cut rates for
its volume discount plan called Reach Out America by 4.9 percent,
but drop basic long-distance rates by only 3.8 percent.
   The 3.8 percent decrease would apply to basic long-distance
rates for calls traveling more than 124 miles. The decrease would
be about the same for daytime, evening and weekend calling periods,
AT&T said.
   Rates for calls of shorter distances, which account for about
one-quarter of AT&T's interstate calls, would be lowered by 1.1
percent. The company cited the need ``to maintain acceptable profit
levels'' on those shorter-distance calls.
   The highest cut would come in rates for AT&T's Software Defined
Network Service, which would drop 6.2 percent.
   WATS rates would be cut by 4 percent, and AT&T would restructure
the service to bill calls individually based on time and distance,
rather than by the current hourly pricing method. This price
reduction would take effect Jan. 1, a month later than the others.
   Rates for AT&T's three PRO WATS calling plans for business
customers would be cut 3.8 percent overall. MEGACOM WATS rates
would drop 4.7 percent and MEGACOM 800 rates would decrease 4.8
percent, while basic AT&T 800 service prices would go down 4
percent.

   Dan Quayle said Tuesday he feels ``a
special obligation'' to help George Bush deal with a new generation
of younger Americans and manage inevitable changes in the nation's
economy.
   Speaking to college students and touring farms in rural
downstate Illinois, the Republican vice presidential candidate
spoke of a ``powerful renewal of change'' Republicans have created
during the Reagan administration.
   ``What is on the new page is dramatic, exciting, a little scary,
a world of incredible change, a world of incredible opportunity,''
he said.
   Quayle spent the day in his brightly festooned bus, occasionally
blaring music from loudspeakers, cruising through what he called
``the heartbeat of this country'' against a backdrop of fall colors
on a gloomy and chilly day.
   At several stops, Quayle was greeted by knots of protesters
chanting ``Quayle go home'' and waving signs, but he was cheered by
crowds at the events.
   ``It is a special obligation for me _ one which I feel more
deeply every day _ to help George Bush define the needs of a new
generation of Americans, their challenges, their responses,''
Quayle said.
   Quayle said changes are inevitable in the workplace and the
economy, adding, ``The question is not whether they happen but
whether we will shape the world through them or they will shape
us.''
   He started his campaign day speaking by telephone with Bush, who
was in Missouri. ``Quayle said he hoped at some point that they
could get together,'' said spokesman David Prosperi.
   On Monday, Quayle told reporters a joint appearance by the two
would be ``a little bit counterproductive.''
   He stopped Tuesday in a half-dozen tiny towns in a comfortably
outfitted bus, stopping occasionally to speak to students dismissed
briefly from classes.
   ``This campaign is full of controlled spontaneity,'' Prosperi
said.
   On his bus, Quayle relaxed in shirtsleeves giving interviews
with reporters and waving to spectators while a crew from ABC's
``Nightline'' filmed a program about the daily grind of the
campaign trail.
   Prosperi said they switched to a bus caravan because the towns
on Tuesday's itinerary were far too small for the campaign
airplane. He added that a suporting role in small-town America is
only natural for the No. 2 man on the ticket.
   With some polls showing Quayle a detriment to the GOP ticket,
there have been suggestions that campaign strategists are trying to
keep him out of the limelight. Prosperi said that wasn't the case.
   At one point Quayle spoke to hundreds of denim-clad youngsters
on a farm near Chrisman, sporting a blue Future Farmers of America
jacket with his name sewn on the lapel, posing before hay bales and
a giant American flag.
   Illinois Gov. James Thompson, once mentioned as a potential
running mate for Bush before the GOP convention last summer, came
along for the day.
   ``This trip today sends a message,'' Thompson said. ``George
Bush and Dan Quayle care about the people who live in and work in
small-town America.''

   Nobel Prize-winning scientist Linus Pauling
traces his scholarly triumphs to his childhood years in Condon, a
small north-central Oregon community where his father ran a drug
store.
   ``I may very well owe a lot of my understanding of the nature of
the world to the introduction I received in Condon,'' Pauling, 87,
said at the dedication of an airport that bears his name.
   About 200 people huddled out of the wind in a hangar at newly
named Condon State Airport-Pauling Field on Saturday to hear
Pauling speak.
   The Gilliam County Historical Society presented Pauling with a
brick from the walkway in front of Herman Pauling's Red Cross Drug
Store. A red cross and nickel are imbedded in the brick.
   Pauling, who was 5 when his family moved to Condon from Portland
in 1906, said he remembered the brick, especially the nickel,
because, ``I could never get it out.''
   He reciprocated with a cut glass bowl saved from the drug store
by his sister in a 1908 fire. Historical society president June
Kamerrer said the bowl would be displayed in the society's museum.
   Pauling's father was a manufacturing pharmacist who prescribed
and mixed medicines and salves on a marble slab in his store.
   Fifty-six years ago, Pauling published ``The Nature of the
Chemical Bond,'' a book regarded today as a science classic.
   He won his first Nobel Prize in 1954 for chemistry, and won the
1962 Nobel Prize for peace for efforts to ban nuclear testing. His
nuclear test ban petition was signed by more than 9,000 scientists
in 44 countries.
   Condon's airport, originally built in the mid-1940s by local
businessmen, underwent a $1 million renovation, including a new
3,500-foot lighted runway.

<TEXT>
   One of three gray whales trapped nearly
two weeks by Arctic Sea ice has pneumonia, but biologists say the
bleeding and battered behemoths should survive at least until a
risky, long-shot attempt at freeing them.
   An Alaska Army National Guard Skycrane helicopter was readied to
lift off early today from Prudhoe Bay to tow a 185-ton
Hovercraft-type ice-breaking barge 200 miles northwest to the
whales. The trip was expected to take from 25 to 40 hours.
   Mike Haller, a National Guard spokesman, said the lift was
delayed Monday while VECO Inc., the oil field service company that
owns the barge, repaired some of the air skirts on the underside of
the vehicle.
   It had been anticipated the operation would get under way about
11 a.m. EDT today, but it was delayed by a few hours. By midmorning
Alaska time (midafternoon EDT), fueling of the barge and the
process of rigging the helicopter to the barge were almost
completed but the barge was still at Prudhoe Bay.
   ``It took longer to get the barge ready than anticipated,''
Haller said earlier today. ``The crews worked all night, and the
pilots want to make sure there's as much daylight as possible.''
   The endangered California gray whales became trapped while
migrating south to warmer waters. The 24-30-foot-long mammals were
bleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jagged ice
and were exhausted from swimming against the ocean current to
remain in place.
   The whales were trapped 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat
Eskimo village. They were only a few hundred feet offshore in 45
feet of water, with their largest ice hole about 10-by-20 feet.
   Villagers and biologists used ice picks Monday to keep the
breathing holes open in the 6-inch thick ice, but sub-zero
temperatures threatened to seal them.
   Ron Morris, with the National Marine Fisheries Service, said he
and several veterinarians went onto the ice Monday to study the
whales, and noticed that one had symptoms of pneumonia.
   ``Their condition has worsened since they were first spotted,''
Morris said. ``One has a little pneumonia but the others are all
right. We're being cautiously optimistic.
   ``We've got only one way to go, and that's up. But there's no
question in my mind that they'll be here when the vehicle arrives.''
   The whales ordinarily can stay underwater nearly four minutes
without air, said Geoff Carroll, a North Slope Borough biologist.
Carroll said they have been surfacing about every two minutes,
indicating they were becoming tired and under stress.
   Biologists said they are surprised the trapped whales have not
drawn the attention of polar bears, and they carried shotguns
Monday night in case the large predators showed up.
   They said they were overwhelmed by the interest in the trapped
whales. ``Every year, probably dozens of grays drown or are crushed
by the ice, but nobody ever knows about it,'' said biologist Craig
George.
   The interest even extended to Washington, where White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that President Reagan may
call the people in charge of the whale rescue this afternoon to
offer moral support.
   Rescuers raced against onshore winds that threatened to close
breaks in the ice that would serve as an escape route if the
ice-breaking barge is able to free them.
   ``It was 17 below last night,'' Carroll said. ``The thickness of
the ice is increasing rapidly. It's growing a matter of inches
every day.''
   Environmentalists, federal authorities and the oil industry have
joined in the unusual alliance to rush the icebreaking barge to the
whales so it can crush a narrow path to open water a half-dozen
miles away.
   Crews labored around the clock during the weekend and into the
Arctic darkness Monday to get the barge and the Skycrane ready.
   ``We're not going to move that thing until we can make sure
we'll have a clean run to Barrow,'' said Pete Leathard, a spokesman
for Veco Inc., an oil field servicing company that owns the barge.
``The Arctic is not a good place to break down in winter.''
   Plans called for the helicopter to pull the 85-by-60-foot barge
with an 800-foot cable, Haller said.
   ``The plan has great potential for danger because of the
altitude of the helicopter in the towing position. The nose is
down,'' he said. ``The danger is that if a line snaps and comes
back up and gets in the rotors, we've got real trouble.''
   The helicopter, which costs $1,500 to $3,000 an hour to operate,
will trade off with a second Skycrane, which has been flown to
Prudhoe Bay. The barge is to carry 20,000 gallons of fuel for the
helicopters and the barge, Haller said. The fuel was provided by
Arco Alaska Inc.
   Oil company officials have estimated that that portion of the
rescue effort could cost as much as $500,000.
   Greenpeace representative Cindy Lowry arrived here Sunday with
recordings of migrating whales that she wants to play along the ice
floe to lure the whales to safety.
   California grays number about 20,000 and have been growing an
average 2.5 percent a year for the past decade.
   The whales spend their winters in the warm waters off Mexico and
Southern California.

   Michael Dukakis is trying to bolster his
organization in vital states by sending dozens of aides from his
national headquarters into the field and backing them up with more
than 1,300 new volunteers from Washington, aides said Tuesday.
   Jack Corrigan, director of operations for the Democratic
campaign, said about 60 percent of the workers at the Boston
headquarters are being assigned to target states for the final
three weeks of the campaign. He could not provide a specific number.
   Among the senior Dukakis aides assisting with the drive is
Marcia Hale, who since the Democratic National Convention in July
has been working on plans for a transition to a Dukakis presidency.
   Hale, a South Carolina native, has temporarily delegated her
transition duties to a deputy and now is focusing, from Boston, on
Southern states in which the Democrats believe they are still
competitive, principally Georgia and Louisiana.
   Joining the Boston operatives being assigned to field operations
will be more than 1,300 new volunteers from Washington, said Wendy
Sherman, who runs Dukakis' headquarters there. That group consists
of congressional aides who have taken leaves, numerous attorneys
with ties to Democratic politics and college students from area
campuses, Ms. Sherman said.
   ``It's a pretty encouraging sign, I think, about how strong we
are going to be in the field on Election Day,'' Corrigan said. ``We
have a very strong grass-roots organization. It got us through the
primaries and it is one of the things that is going to pull us
through on Election Day.''
   Volunteers, depending on their prior election experience, will
be assigned tasks ranging from political work in target precincts
to helping with phone banks and distributing leaflets, Ms. Sherman
said.
   Some of the congressional aides, most of whom have worked on
prior campaigns, are being sent back to their home states but many
also are being assigned to key states, she said.
   ``Our state party offices are quite capable of running a very
effective get-out-the-vote effort but you need bodies to do that,''
she said Tuesday in a telephone interview. ``This will give us the
influx of people we need to win on election night.''
   The congressional recess also will allow the Dukakis campaign to
schedule more appearances by members of Congress who have
volunteered to serve as surrogates for the Democratic ticket,
Corrigan said.
   Recent polls have shown Dukakis well behind Bush, but Ms.
Sherman said party officials calling her office to request more
volunteers have been relaying a far more optimistic picture.
   ``State party chairs will call and say, `I know I can win my
state but I'm worried about this state or another state,''' she
said. ``We're very encouraged by what we're seeing in the states.''

   A grand jury will be asked to review
the scalding death of a deaf 9-year-old girl at a state-run school
because a prosecutor said he's not convinced her death was
accidental.
   Jennifer Driggers died last Thursday from first- and
second-degree burns she suffered in a hot shower, according to a
preliminary report issued by Medical Examiner Robert McConnell. He
ruled the death an accident.
   However, Assistant State Attorney Steve Alexander has taken
testimony from three paramedics and subpoenaed medical records from
Flagler Hospital and the doctor who treated the girl.
   ``You can say accidental, accidental, accidental, but I've not
been convinced,'' Alexander said Monday.
   Officials of the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind said new
statements from witnesses show the girl slipped in the shower and
hit her head before being scalded to death.
   Jeanette Gadson, 29, the staff member supervising Jennifer, was
placed on leave with pay, school officials announced Monday.
   The girl's mother, Robin Driggers, said she doesn't believe her
daughter entered the shower on her own because she was terrified of
hot water and questioned why she didn't get out of the way of the
hot water.
   McConnell said there was no evidence that anyone else was
involved in the death, although Mrs. Driggers said she thinks her
daughter may have been held under the water.
   Earlier, school officials reported that the girl ran into the
shower after becoming ill in the bathroom. But on Monday Assistant
Principal Danny Hutto said it appeared the girl slipped and banged
her head when she was hit by the scalding water.
   McConnell said he found a bump on the back of the girl's head
while conducting the autopsy.
   ``The question still remains, why did she go into the shower,
and when the water hit her, why did she fall back rather than get
out of the water?'' Hutto said.
   Mrs. Driggers said the child had twice been previously injured
at the school. The girl was assaulted by a roommate last year and
fell in the shower at the school in November 1986.

   Israeli troops firing plastic bullets killed
two Palestinians _ a teen-ager and a 5-year-old boy _ and wounded a
U.S. journalist during clashes Tuesday in the occupied West Bank,
Arab hospital officials said.
   An army spokesman confirmed the deaths and said five people had
plastic bullet wounds, including American photographer Neal Cassidy
_ the first foreign journalist shot in the 10-month Palestinian
uprising over Israeli rule in the occupied lands.
   Hospital officials said six people were wounded.
   The 5-year-old boy died after he was hit with plastic bullets in
the chest, stomach and left hand as he played in a schoolyard near
his home, according to officials at Al Ittihad Hospital.
   The child, identified as Deyaa Fayez, was shot when Israeli
soldiers opened fire on a nearby group of stone-throwing
Palestinians, Arab reporters said. The reporters and hospital
officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hospital officials identified the second victim as Khaled
Tbaileh, 14, of Nablus. Officials at St. John Hospital said he was
shot in the chest with a plastic bullet in a second clash in
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city.
   The deaths raised to 301 the number of Palestinians killed since
Arabs launched the uprising Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died.
   Israel has occupied the territories since the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Cassidy, 37, of Oakland, Calif., was hit in the right leg while
photographing a demonstration in the Nablus market area.
   The army spokesman had no details on the child's death but said
soldiers opened fire in the market after demonstrators threw stones
and bottles.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under military
regulations, said Cassidy was close to the rioters and ``endangered
himself'' by being in the area, which was closed to outsiders under
military orders.
   Cassidy and five Palestinians ranging in age from 16 to 23 were
wounded, hospital officials said. All suffered plastic bullet
wounds, they said.
   Hospital officials have reported six deaths by plastic bullets
since the army introduced their use in August.
   Plastic bullets are intended to supplement rubber bullets, tear
gas and lead bullets in quelling anti-Israeli riots. They are not
usually lethal if fired from a distance of more than 200 feet.
   But doctors have said the plastic ammunition can kill if it
penetrates the neck, chest or abdomen, and Palestinian deaths and
injuries from the bullets have drawn U.N., U.S., British and
Egyptian protests.
   Cassidy was covering the Nablus protest for Frontline, a
biweekly newspaper published in Oakland. He also works for Impact
Visuals, a photo agency in New York.
   Frontline writer Phyllis Bennis said Cassidy was standing in the
Nablus market ``near a group of young men chanting and banging on
doors.'' She said a group of Israeli soldiers was nearby.
   ``Suddenly, without warning, the soldiers began firing,'' Ms.
Bennis quoted Cassidy as telling her. She said she did not see the
shooting.
   Ms. Bennis said she and Cassidy have been in the country for
three weeks reporting on Palestinian life under the occupation.
   Officials at the Government Press Office in Jerusalem said they
had no record of Cassidy being accredited to work in Israel.
   Cassidy plans to file a formal complaint with the U.S. Consulate
after his return to Jerusalem, Ms. Bennis said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
the U.S. consulate general in Jerusalem is investigating the
circumstances of the shooting.
   Also Tuesday, the Supreme Court barred U.S.-born Rabbi Meir
Kahane from running in the Nov. 1 election, saying his anti-Arab
Kach movement is racist. Kahane told reporters that he was urging
backers to boycott the vote.
   The court also ruled the Progressive List for Peace, which calls
for a Palestinian state alongside Israel, could compete in the
elections. The right-wing Likud bloc had demanded the party's
ouster for allegedly seeking to destroy Israel's Jewish character.

   Actress Kim Bassinger, the sassy ex-model who

Athens, Ga.
   ``I had a strange prettiness that was not accepted,'' she said

myself into my own little cult.''
   In 1974, she became Breck Girl and later a Ford model at the

<HEAD>Hurricane Joan Continues Unusual Path Through Caribbean</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with report of dead, missing in
Colombia. Picks up 3rd graf pvs, `At noon...'.</NOTE>

   Hurricane Joan's 80 mph winds churned across the
open Caribbean today on an unusual southern path that has
forecasters puzzling over its potential strength and possible
landfall. There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead or
missing in a town in Colombia the day before.
   ``Joan is one of a kind,'' said Jim Gross, a meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center. ``You just don't see many hurricanes
that take this course and hug the coast.''
   In Colombia, an official of the state of Bolivar in the northern
part of the country said the storm triggered flooding in the town
of Carmen de Bolivar, about 360 miles north of the capital of
Bogota.
   Water roared down three gullies in the town as the storm passed
Monday, Victor Leon Mendoza, a state government administrator, told
the Colombian radio chain RCN.
   ``Preliminary reports from the mayor's office indicate that
about 50 persons are dead or missing'' in the town, he said.
   At noon EDT today, Joan's center was near latitude 11.1 north
and longitude 76.3 west, about 70 miles west of the Colombian coast
and about 380 miles east of the island of San Andres off the coast
of Nicaragua. The hurricane was moving west at 10 mph and was
expected to continue that motion through today.
   Panama issued a hurricane watch for its north coast, and
Colombia issued a hurricane watch for San Andres, which is part of
Colombia even though it is located close to Nicaragua.
   Joan, the Atlantic season's fifth hurricane, is expected to
bring 4 to 8 inches of rain along its path.
   As a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, Joan slowly built its
strength as it skimmed Colombia's coast, baffling forecasters who
had predicted it to weaken.
   It reached hurricane force Monday night and its center began to
become better defined, a sign the system could intensify over open
water into the western Caribbean, forecasters said.
   On its present path, it would be at least 48 hours before the
main part of the hurricane reached Central America, Gross said late
Monday.
   Gross said a strong high-pressure system over the northern
Caribbean is keeping Joan on its course. Normally, prevailing winds
and upper-level atmospheric conditions push tropical storms
northward as they move from the Atlantic, said Gross.
   Also, he said hurricanes are often sapped of strength in the far
southern Caribbean due to trade winds that push colder deep-ocean
water to the surface, said Gross.
   Joan became the 10th named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season when top winds passed 39 mph on Oct. 11. Hurricane strength
is 74 mph.
   Gilbert, the most devastating hurricane in recent years, left
more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage as
it tore through Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico's Yucatan
peninsula last month.
   The six-month hurricane season ends Nov. 30.

<HEAD>`Rust Belt' Making Income Gains, But Coasts Still Prevail</HEAD>

   Income growth in the ``Rust Belt''
manufacturing states is staging a comeback after lagging behind the
national average for most of the 1980s, the government said Tuesday.
   The trend represents an easing in, but not an end to, a
phenomenon Reagan administration critics have labeled the
``bicoastal economy.''
   The administration has pointed with pride to the six-year
economic recovery, the longest during peacetime since the Civil
War. However, critics say the nation's heartland has not shared in
the expansion.
   In a report on non-farm personal income, the Commerce Department
said, in general, states bordering the Pacific and Atlantic coasts
continue to have better income growth than the states in between,
but the gap in the growth rates is narrowing.
   New England, a center of the boom in computer and other
high-technology industries, still leads the nation in income
growth. From the second quarter (April-June) of 1987 to second
quarter of this year, income grew 9.5 percent, compared with 8.7
percent average annual growth since the end of the last recession
in the third quarter of 1982.
   New England's growth for both periods was well above the
national average of 7.7 percent in the 12 months ending in June _
the latest period for which figures are available _ and the 7.1
percent annual average for 1982-87. The growth rates are not
adjusted to remove the effects of consumer price inflation, which
was 4 percent in the 12 months ending in June.
   New Hampshire and Massachussets posted particularly strong
income gains of 10.7 percent and 9.9 percent, respectively, in the
latest year available.
   But gains in manufacturing have pushed income growth in the
Great Lakes states up to average, and growth in Mid-Atlantic states
has climbed from the middle ranks to above average.
   In the 12 months ending in June, growth in the Mid-Atlantic
region, led by Delaware and New Jersey, was 8.7 percent, compared
with 7.4 percent annual growth in the 1982-87 period.
   Growth in the Great Lakes region, which lagged behind during the
years of the overvalued dollar and exploding trade deficit, was 7.7
percent in the 12 months ending in June, compared with 6.2 percent
earlier in the decade.
   Meanwhile, income growth in the Far West and the Southeast has
cooled a bit from above-average rates.
   The Southeast, part of the ``Sun Belt'' boom of the early 1980s,
inched down to a 7.5 percent growth rate from 7.9 percent in
1982-87. The Far West cooled to 7.8 percent in the latest 12
months, down from 8.2 percent.
   The Plains states, Southwest and Rocky Mountain area, all
dependent on either agriculture, mining, oil drilling or a
combination, all showed improvement, but remain at the bottom of
the list.
   Income growth in the Plains was 6.2 percent in the 12 months
ending in June, up from 5.9 percent earlier; in the Southwest, 5.8
percent, up from 5.5 percent; and in the Rocky Mountain area, 5.2
percent, up from 5.1 percent.
   The Commerce Department attributed gains in the Great Lakes
states to strength in the manufacturing of durable goods, ``big
ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, and in
construction. It said the Mid-Atlantic region also benefited from a
pickup in manufacturing.
   Economists had been anticipating income gains in the
manufacturing ``Rust Belt'' of the nation. The drop in the value of
the dollar over the last three years has made U.S. goods less
expensive on overseas markets and has fueled a boom in export sales
this year.
   In a separate report Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board said
virtually every one of its 12 regional banks were reporting
``continued strength or expansion ... across a wide range of
(manufacturing) industries.''
   However, the report prepared for a Nov. 1 meeting of Fed policy
makers, said ``manufacturers are becoming less optimistic about
coming months.'' They've become more cautious about the first half
of 1989 following a slight slowdown late this summer, the report
said.
   Although income growth in the Southeast as a whole was down,
according to the Commerce Department, by state it was mixed. Weak
growth in incomes from service jobs in Georgia and interior states
more than offset strong growth in the Atlantic coast states of
Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and South Carolina.

<HEAD>Trial in Ethnic Rioting Begins in Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Azerbaijanis went on trial Tuesday on murder
and arson charges in riots that killed 32 people and highlighted
ethnic tensions.
   The defendants were flown in from the Azerbaijani capital of
Baku and taken to the Soviet Supreme Court building in Moscow in
three unmarked gray trucks. About two dozen Armenians stood
silently outside the building holding copies of death certificates
for the victims, many of whom were their relatives.
   The group later was allowed into the courtroom.
   Azerbaijanis went on a rampage Feb. 28 in Sumgait, an industrial
city on the Caspian Sea about 20 miles north of Baku. They burned
and looted buildings, hunted down Armenians and killed them,
official and unofficial reports have said. Of the 32 victims, 26
were Armenians and six were Azerbaijanis, officials said. Official
reports had said more than 200 people were injured, but a Tass news
agency dispatch Tuesday gave a figure twice as high.
   Some Armenians say the death toll was much higher and have cited
Sumgait as a national tragedy they will never forget.
   Armenia's Communist Party chief, Suren Arutyunyan, said Oct. 8
that Sumgait was ``an unhealed wound in people's souls.''
   The rioting was sparked by a massive Armenian campaign for
control of the Nagorno-Karabakh district of Azerbaijan. In addition
to violence, the dispute over the mostly Armenian district has
triggered strikes in the southern republics of Azerbaijan and
neighboring Armenia.
   The two ethnic groups, of the Soviet Union's more than 100
nationalities, differ in culture and religion.
   Foreign reporters who waited outside the Supreme Court building
were not allowed to attend the trial. Court officials told the
reporters they need the permission of the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
but the spokesman for that agency, Gennady I. Gerasimov, said the
trial was not open to correspondents. Gerasimov did not say why
reporters were barred.
   A court official, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified
the defendants as ethnic Azerbaijanis and gave their names as Ahmed
I. Akhmedov, Ilgam A. Ismailov and Yavar G. Dzhafarov. The official
said each was accused of participating in the murder of one person.
   Tass said they were charged with ``organizing and and taking a
direct part in mass disorders accompanied by pogroms, acts of arson
and murders.''
   Tass quoted a court official as saying dozens of witnesses would
testify and that the indictment was more than 100 pages long.
   The death certificates held by Armenians bore pictures of the
victims and descriptions of how they were murdered. Many in the
group wore black and displayed buttons of Armenia's national flag.
   Moving the trial to Moscow represented a victory for Armenian
activists who had complained that previous legal cases stemming
from the rioting were biased because they were conducted by
Azerbaijanis on their territory.
   On July 8, the Soviet Supreme Court and prosecutor's office
shifted the cases to the Russian federation, an Armenian demand.
Tuesday's trial in Moscow, the capital of the federation, was the
first in an unknown number of cases the Supreme Court will hear in
the rioting.
   Before the change of venue, Azerbaijan's Supreme Court on May 15
convicted an Azerbaijani metalworker of pre-meditated murder in the
rioting and gave him the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.
Officials have said more than 80 people have been charged in the
unrest.
   Twenty-five people already have been sentenced, Radio Moscow
reported Tuesday, but the official press has carried little on the
cases, and even Arutyunyan, the Armenian party first secretary,
complained.
   ``We see how the obviously delayed investigation reopened old
wounds, how people are shaken by the fact that the legal
examination is being conducted in various cities of the country and
that no information is coming into the republic about who was
punished, what the sentence was,'' Arutyunyan said Oct. 8.
   He said the most serious of the cases would be heard by the
Supreme Court in Moscow.

<TEXT>
   Several House members found themselves in
ethical or legal trouble during the 100th Congress but Rep. Pat
Swindall, who was indicted on perjury charges this week, is one of
the few who also is in trouble with the voters.
   Republican Swindall is trailing his Democratic challenger, Ben
Jones, by 51 percent to 33 percent in their suburban Atlanta
district, according to an Oct. 13-14 poll cited by the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
   By contrast, Rep. Harold Ford, D-Tenn., indicted April 24, 1987,
on bank fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy charges and still awaiting
trial, has only token opposition in his bid for an eighth House
term from Memphis.
   Many lawmakers who have been investigated by the House ethics
committee have encountered little challenge _ or none at all _ in
seeking re-election.
   Swindall also is unusual because he is the lone Republican in a
sea of problem-plagued Democrats, a circumstance the Democratic
committee attributes to politically motivated complaints of ethics
violations.
   ``Most of these charges are pretty unfounded, and the bottom
line is the voters will re-elect these people on the merits of
their service,'' said committee spokeswoman Peggy Connolly. ``The
voters serve as jurors on Election Day.''
   Swindall, 38, was indicted on 10 counts of lying to a grand jury
investigating a drug money-laundering scheme. Swindall says he will
represent himself at his trial, which could begin as early as
Monday, and expresses confidence his name will be cleared before
the Nov. 8 election.
   Jones, a recovering alcoholic and an actor who played Cooter the
mechanic in the television series, ``Dukes of Hazzard,'' is taking
his second shot at Swindall's seat. He held Swindall to 53 percent
of the vote in 1986, before any of the Republican incumbent's
current troubles began.
   Swindall is the 16th congressman to be indicted in the past
decade and the third in the current Congress, after Ford and former
Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y. Biaggi resigned after his conviction in
two unrelated corruption cases, but his name will appear on the New
York ballot as a Republican.
   Numerous other House members were investigated by Hill ethics
panels in the past two years, but few if any seem likely to suffer
negative consequences in the election three weeks away.
   Last December, the House reprimanded Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa.,
for permitting votes to be cast in his name when he was absent,
diverting House resources to his former law firm and putting a
ghost employee on his payroll. But Murphy, who represents a heavily
Democratic district in western Pennsylvania, faces only token
opposition to re-election.
   Another member, Democrat Charlie Rose of North Carolina, was
``sharply rebuked'' by the House ethics panel in March for
borrowing campaign funds for personal use. He is expected to win
re-election easily.
   So is House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, the highly visible
target of an ethics committee investigation triggered by Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga. Wright has no rival for his Fort Worth seat.
   The ethics panel is investigating six allegations against
Wright, including using his office improperly to lobby government
officials on matters in which he had a financial interest, and
receiving unusually fat royalties from a book published by a
campaign contractor.
   Others who were targets of ethics investigations included:
   _Rep. Ferdinand St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House
Banking Committee. The House ethics panel cleared him of wrongdoing
last year after a 14-month investigation into allegations he had
used his influence to amass a $2 million fortune in real estate
investments. Still pending are allegations that he failed to report
meals and entertainment paid by a housing industry lobbyist. Recent
polls show St Germain with a nearly 2-1 lead over a weak opponent.
   _Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio. She kept an aide on her payroll
for nearly two years after the aide had moved from Washington to
New York, in violation of House rules. Ms. Oakar reimbursed the
government and was not disciplined, and she has virtually no
competition in seeking re-election.
   _Former Rep. Bill Boner, D-Tenn. The ethics panel said in
December that Boner improperly used campaign funds for a trip to
Hong Kong and may have accepted a bribe from a defense contractor
in the form of $50,000 in legal fees paid to his wife. But Boner
had already resigned to become mayor of Nashville, and the panel
said it no longer had jurisdiction.
   In addition, at least two congressmen allegedly subjected female
aides to sexual harassment. One of them, Rep. Ernie Konnyu,
R-Calif., was the first and only incumbent to lose a primary this
year. The other, Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., is expected to win
re-election.
   Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., had a rocky year. His administrative
assistant committed suicide after a newspaper reported that the
aide had required young male staffers to socialize with him. And
Dyson's ties with defense contractors were scrutinized in
connection with the Pentagon procurement fraud investigation.
   Dyson has denied any wrongdoing and is running against the same
Republican candidate he steamrollered by a 2-1 margin in the 1986
election.
   Another Democrat whose name surfaced in the Pentagon inquiry,
Rep. Bill Chappell of Florida, is also expected to coast to an easy
re-election victory.
   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., who acknowledges he is being
investigated in connection with the Wedtech corruption scandal in
the Bronx, also is a safe re-election bet.
   Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, is trying to beat the Internal
Revenue Service's demand for $90,000 in back taxes from unreported
bribe income. Traficant was acquitted after a criminal trial of
accepting the bribes, but the IRS insists it is owed the money.
Traficant's appeal is pending in federal court, but he faces no
problem at the polls.
   A non-voting delegate to Congress, Democrat Fofo Sunia of
American Samoa, resigned this fall after being convicted of payroll
padding.

<HEAD>Random Drug Testing Planned For More Than 100,000 Rail Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Railroad Administration plans
to order random drug testing for more than 100,000 rail workers
assigned to safety-sensitive jobs, FRA Administrator John H. Riley
said.
   Although approximately 250,000 people in the United States work
for six major railroad companies, 40 medium-size railroads and
about 350 short lines, only 100,000 work in safety sensitive jobs,
and only they will be subject to the drug tests, Riley said Monday.
   ``In the past 20 months, railroads have had 59 accidents where
one or more employees involved in the accidents have been found to
have been under the influence of drugs. These accidents have
resulted in 33 deaths, 400 injuries and $40 million worth of
property damage,'' he said Monday.
   Riley, who was in Salt Lake City to address the FRA Regional
Safety Conference, said he would soon announce more specifics of
the program, aimed at stamping out drug abuse among rail employees
and increasing railroad transportation safety.
   On June 22, Congress passed the Rail Safety Improvement Act,
which takes effect Jan. 1, 1989. It gives the FRA power, for the
first time in its 21-year history, to suspend and fine railroad
employees.
   The new act also will enable the FRA to fine railroads up to
$10,000 per day per count for safety violations _ four times the
amount the FRA previously was allowed to assess.

   The Rev. Matthew Fox, who has said he wasn't afraid to be
labeled a heretic, will not be permitted to speak publicly or
publish his writings for a year, effective Dec. 15, according to a
report in the National Catholic Reporter, a liberal weekly
newspaper.
   Fox, 47, is the founder of the Institute in Culture and Creation
Spirituality at Holy Names College in Oakland. He scheduled a news
conference for Thursday to discuss the Vatican's action.
   Dan Lattin, a religion writer for the San Francisco Chronicle,
described Fox's curriculum in the paper's Tuesday editions as
having a ``heavy emphasis on Christian mysticism, feminism and
environmentalism.''
   The Vatican, according to the National Catholic Reporter, has
ordered Holy Names College to sever its ties with Fox's institute.
School officials said they will issue a statement after Fox's news
conference.
   Fox has irked conservative Catholics by hiring faculty members
that include a certified masseuse, a Zen Buddhist, a yoga teacher
and a self-described witch named Starhawk, the story said.
   Fox's teachings include a book called ``Original Blessing'' that
criticizes traditional church doctrine for an ``overemphasis'' on
sin and redemption.
   When news of a possible Vatican investigation was reported in
1985, Fox said he was ``not upset if people call me a heretic.''
   ``Joan of Arc was condemned, burned at the stake and then
declared a saint,'' the Dominican said then.
   Fox's teachings have been under review by Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, whose Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ordered
the Rev. Charles Curran dismissed in 1986 from the faculty of
Catholic University in Washington, D.C., for doctrinal liberalism.
   Ratzinger's office was once called the Holy Inquisition.
   Action against Fox could revive tensions between the Vatican and
the U.S. church that surfaced during the Curran controversy and
after Rome disciplined liberal Seattle Archbishop Raymond
Hunthausen.
   The National Catholic Reporter said Fox will partially defy the
Vatican order by taking a one-semester sabbatical.
   ``This work is just too pressing to be postponed until a
neurotic papal regime dies out,'' Fox was quoted as saying. He
reportedly referred to the Vatican action as ``a compliment. It
shows our influence is growing so much that they feel threatened.''
   Fox has based his writing in part on the ideas of Meister
Eckhart, a German Dominican who died in 1327 and whose teachings
were condemned as heresy in 1329 by Pope John XXII.
   Fox has denied his ``creation spirituality'' is the same as
pantheism, the belief that everything is God and God is everything.
Pantheism is considered heresy by the Catholic Church.
   Fox's institute, which he founded in Mundelein College in
Chicago in 1978 and moved to Oakland in 1983, offers a master's
degree in spirituality and has instructed scores of priests and
nuns.

<TEXT>
   A federal panel called Tuesday for universal
access to prenatal care by American women as a way to reduce the
number of babies born diseased and handicapped _ and save a lot of
taxpayer dollars in the process.
   ``The most basic problem is that our nation has failed to give
adequate priority to the principle that all pregnant women _ not
only the affluent _ should receive prenatal, delivery and
postpartum services,'' said Joyce C. Lashof, chairwoman of the
Institute of Medicine study committee.
   The panel's two-year survey started out trying to determine what
type of outreach programs would be most effective in providing
pregnant woman with prenatal care.
   But it soon concluded that the problem ran deeper than women not
being aware of services available to them.
   ``Our central conclusion is that outreach efforts are no match
for the pervasive barriers faced by low-income women in trying to
secure adequate prenatal and maternity-care services,'' Lashof said
at a news conference where the 254-page report was issued.
   ``As is so often the case, the principal barrier is money,''
said Lashof, who is dean of the School of Public Health at the
University of California-Berkeley.
   The report said about 26 percent of women of child-bearing age
have no insurance _ public or private _ to cover maternity care and
that two-thirds of these, or about 9.5 million women, have no
health insurance at all.
   In many ways, the panelists concluded, money itself is not as
much of a problem as lack of will to make a national commitment to
tackle the problem in a comprehensive way.
   Although there would be an initial investment of new funds to
expand Medicaid to cover more pregnant women, for example, the
money would pay a three-fold dividend by producing more healthy
babies and thus fewer sick and handicapped ones to care for at
public expense.
   ``For every dollar spent on prenatal care for low-income, poorly
educated women, about $3 are saved in medical expenses for
low-birthweight babies during the first year of life,'' said
Lashof, citing figures from a 1985 Institute of Medicine study.
   Indeed, many of the fundamental findings in the new survey track
two studies released in recent months by the congressional Office
of Technology Assessment and the National Commission to Prevent
Infant Mortality.
   Lashof said the major new conclusion of the latest study is that
trying to refine outreach programs for women in need of prenatal
care is more or less wasted effort until actual barriers to such
care are removed.
   A majority of the six panelists at the news conference expressed
optimism that the nation will provide proper prenatal care in the
near future _ in part because multiple studies seem to have
demonstrated beyond doubt the sheer cost effectiveness of such
programs.
   ``If anything gets attention, it's dollars and cents,'' said
panelist George M. Ryan. ``I just don't think this nation is going
to go on paying to take care of handicapped infants when we can
prevent the handicaps with proper prenatal care.''
   Ryan is an obstetrics and gynecology professor at the University
of Tennessee medical school in Memphis.
   The panel was blunt in its conclusion that the time has come to
act rather than study the problem to death.
   ``The committee specifically urges that no more research be
conducted to demonstrate the importance of financial and other
institutional barriers to care,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Ohio Governor Demands that Reagan Close Uranium Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste demanded Tuesday
that President Reagan shut down a government-owned uranium
processing plant until something is done to stop the radioactive
pollution it produces.
   The U.S. Department of Energy admitted Friday at a congressional
committee hearing in Washington that the government has known of
dangerous environmental problems at the Feed Materials Production
Center since it was established in 1951, Celeste said.
   The governor said he wrote a letter to Reagan demanding that the
plant, located in Fernald about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati,
be closed. The plant processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons,
which are made elsewhere.
   ``This admission of deceit and mismanagement confirms and
emphasizes what we have known in Ohio for a long time: This
facility is an environmental disaster threatening the health and
safety of thousands of Ohioans,'' Celeste wrote.
   The letter demands that the Energy Department, which owns the
plant, pay for an independent evaluation of plant employees and
nearby residents to determine how their health has been affected.
   The governor also said the department should treat and stabilize
radioactive thorium at the plant; begin a final cleanup of
radioactive waste stored in two deteriorating concrete silos; and
start identifying the contents of 200,000 containers of waste that
have accumulated as a result of what the governor said is the
department's negligent management of the plant.
   Celeste and Richard Shank, director of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, said they believe the plant has been better
managed since Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio took over its
operation in January 1986. But they said they are concerned about
more than 30 years of radioactive emissions into the atmosphere and
into the water table.
   The Energy Department admitted in January 1985 that faulty
exhaust air filters at the plant had allowed the release of at
least 200,000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into the
atmosphere during the past three decades, including at least 3,000
pounds from 1980 to 1985.
   Five people who live near the plant then filed a $300 million,
class-action lawsuit alleging that the former operator, National
Lead Co., was negligent in failing to prevent the uranium releases
and that the releases contaminated property and may have caused
health and personal injuries.
   The lawsuit is pending in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati.
   The Energy Department prompted the new furor by admitting in
court documents that government officials had been aware of
potential environmental problems at the plant, but still directed
National Lead managers to proceed with uranium processing.
   The state sued the Energy Department in 1985, charging it with
polluting the environment at the 1,050-acre site. That lawsuit also
is pending in U.S. District Court.
   Celeste said the state, which tried to negotiate with the Energy
Department for a cleanup, received no cooperation until the lawsuit
was filed.
   ``When Ohio's concern about conditions at the facility led the
state to attempt to become involved, the door was repeatedly
slammed in our faces. Essentially, we have been told that this
major threat to public health and safety is none of our business,''
Celeste said in the letter.
   James Reafsnyder, the Energy Department's site manager, declined
comment Tuesday and referred queries to spokeswoman Gail Bradshaw
in Washington. She was unavailable for calls.
   Pat Weber, a White House spokeswoman for Reagan, said the Energy
Department already has begun what is billed as a $500 million,
decade-long project to clean up and modernize the plant.

<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old woman has been sentenced
to 30 days in jail for embezzling almost $5,000 to pay for her
wedding to a sheriff's deputy because she ``wanted to look better
than her sister did.''
   Kelly Susan Horton was sentenced Monday after pleading guilty
Aug. 28 to embezzling $4,870 from what was then American National
Bank in Plainwell, where she worked as a teller. Horton used the
money to pay for her wedding in August 1985, according to court
records.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Enslen also ordered Horton to pay
full restitution to her creditors.
   ``This isn't the worst crime I've ever seen,'' Enslen said,
``but it's the shallowest.
   ``You say that what you wanted was to look as good as your
sister or better,'' Enslen said. ``Your father had already
contributed money that he probably did not have and you repaid that
kindness by stealing.''
   Because Horton's husband, Ken Horton, is an Allegan County
sheriff's deputy, she will serve her sentence in the Kalamazoo or
Kent County Jail.
   Horton declined to comment on his wife's sentence.
   ``You knew that your husband was a law enforcement officer, but
it wasn't important to you that he might be embarrassed,'' Enslen
said. ``What a terrible crime to commit.''
   Asked by Enslen if she had anything to say for herself before he
sentenced her, Horton cried ``I'm sorry ...'' then began weeping
and could not continue.
   ``My client has had lots of physical and emotional problems due
to this circumstance,'' said Earl Dalzell, the woman's attorney.
``What she did was obviously wrong and she knows that.''
   According to court records, among the items Horton purchased
with the embezzled money were a wedding dress veil that cost $300,
wedding invitations that cost $200, a wedding cake that cost $150
and a band for the reception for $500.

<HEAD>Forest Service Using Reforestation Fund For Firefighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Forest Service has raided a key
reforestation trust fund to cover more than $500 million in
firefighting expenses over the past two years, and the agency's
budget director said Tuesday he's not sure where the money will
come from if next summer is a bad fire season.
   ``The problem is where are we going to get funds to fight fires
in 1989?'' said John Leasure.
   Leasure's comments came as an Oregon congressman on Tuesday
introduced legislation that would create a special fund to cover
the Forest Service's firefighting expenses.
   Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio said that under his bill, half of
the agency's reciepts from timber sales in national forests and
other fees would be deposited in the special Emergency Fire
Fighting Trust Fund. Money left in the fund after the firefighting
costs were paid would be turned over to the U.S. Treasury.
   ``As it is now, the potential for disaster is immense,'' said
DeFazio. ``We might not have money for reforestation or to fight
fires. The present system just isn't working.''
   The Forest Service has traditionally sought only a token amount
for firefighting costs in its annual budget. The agency would
borrow from one of its other accounts if more money was needed and
then ask Congress later for additional funding to repay the account.
   DeFazio said, however, that a budget agreement between Congress
and the Reagan administration essentially eliminated the
possibility of any supplemental appropriations and that any effort
to secure additional funding to cover firefighting costs could
``trigger'' the automatic budget cuts established under the
Gramm-Rudman act.
   ``It's a mess,'' said DeFazio.
   Recently, the Forest Service has been borrowing heavily from the
so-called Knutsen-Vanderberg trust fund. Fees timber operators pay
when they log in the national forest are deposited in that fund and
the money is earmarked for reforestation projects.
   Over the past two years, the K-V fund has been drawn down from a
high of about $800 million to a current level of about $120
million, Leasure said.
   Collections from the timber harvesters during the current fiscal
year should add between $175 million to $200 million to the K-V
fund, or barely enough to cover the cost of reforestation projects.
   ``We don't expect any difficulties paying for reforestation in
(fiscal) 1989, but it's obvious the trust fund has been drawn down
to just operating levels,'' said Leasure.
   Leasure said the administration had yet to review DeFazio's
legislation, but admitted the entire issue of paying for
firefighting costs and reforestation was ``an issue of concern to
us and many people.''
   DeFazio said that it is well past time for the Forest Service to
``make the books honest. The K-V fund is not a deep pocket. It is
the K-V fund which keeps the Forest Service timberlands renewable.
They will not be renewable if we rob the fund.''
   Leasure said that a total of $508 millon was taken from the K-V
fund to pay for $400 million in firefighting costs this year and
$108 million from last year.
   Even tough Congress recently appropriated $125 million for
firefighting, Leasure said the forest fire season, particularly in
California, is not over.

   Michael Dukakis pledged Tuesday to wipe
out the nation's $150 billion trade deficit in four years and
lashed out at George Bush as a man with ``no convictions, no ideas
and no plans.''
   Dukakis drew enthusiastic crowds at stops in Michigan as aides
contended the race is closer than indicated by polls pointing to a
big Democratic defeat. He depicted the election as a choice between
one candidate who will stand up for average Americans and one who
is the champion of the well-to-do.
   ``George Bush cares about the people on Easy Street. I care
about the people on Main Street,'' he said in a speech on the
University of Western Michigan campus.
   With the poll news ranging between bad and worse, Dukakis and
his aides have been seeking a spark to ignite his faltering
campaign. One woman in his university audience did her best to
oblige.
   The Democratic candidate had just finished saying, ``The
difference between George Bush and me boils down to this'' when she
loudly interrupted, ``You're real and he's not.''
   At that, Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard jumped out of his seat on
the stage behind Dukakis and pumped his fist up and down
energetically and exhorted, ``Let's go'' while the audience cheered
enthusiastically.
   For one day at least, Dukakis and his candidacy seemed to be
generating enthusiasm lacking since last Thursday's poorly reviewed
debate performance _ from Blanchard's cheerleading to crowd chants
of ``Duke Duke Duke.''
   In Saginaw, he declared that Bush ``wants to help those who have
it made. I want to help every American family make it.''
   Dukakis said Bush and the Reagan administration have done
nothing to solve the root causes of the 1987 stock market plunge,
which occurred one year ago Wednesday.
   ``We've got to end the Republican rainbow coalition of red ink
for our children, pink slips for our workers, greenmail for sharp
operators on Wall Street and golden parachutes for top corporate
executives,'' he added.
   Dukakis moved through a three-city tour in Michigan with
statewide polls showing him trailing in the race for the state's 20
electoral votes. His aides seemed far more concerned, though, about
an NBC-Wall Street Journal survey showing a 55-38 Bush lead
nationally.
   Senior aides told reporters at every turn, as they did on
Monday, that they do not believe the poll. They said other surveys
show much smaller margins.
   Dukakis' first speech of the day produced noticeably sharper
rhetoric, along with his announcement of a goal of eliminating the
trade defitic.
   He said in four years the Reagan administration had created the
world's largest trade deficit ``and cost our workers five million
jobs.''
   Dukakis said he would meet his goal of eliminating the trade
deficit by reducing the budget deficit, increasing foreign trade,
investing in education and training and putting more emphasis on
research and development.
   ``How about world hunger?'' was the skeptical retort by Bush
spokeswoman Sheila Tate when told of the Democrat's promises.
   Dukakis added, ``And we're going to give industries that have
been battered by Mr. Bush's reckless policies the breathing space
they need to retool with new technologies and compete with new
skills.''
   Dukakis scorned Bush's approach to the same problem.
   ``Well, he's got the flags and balloons. But no convictions, no
ideas and no plans,'' Dukakis said.
   He said his Republican rival doesn't want to talk about his
plans and said, ``Maybe it's because he hasn't got the vaguest
ideas how to end the trade deficit, how to rebuild out heartland
and how to revive Main Street.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Healthy people on a typical American diet may
have to look no further than their salad dressing for benefits that
some people are seeking from fish oil capsules, Agriculture
Department scientists said Tuesday.
   Chemist Edward A. Emken of the department's Agricultural
Research Service said the human body rapidly converts a part of the
soybean oil used in some ordinary food products into the same kinds
of fatty acids found in fish oil.
   Two men in a preliminary study consumed the soybean oil
component, linolenic acid, and within a few hours their bodies had
coverted it into the same omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and
marine oil, Emken said.
   ``Think of it this way: the body can naturally make its own fish
oil omega-3 fatty acids from the linolenic acid in soybean oil,''
he said in a report released by the USDA agency.
   The report said capsules of fish and marine oils have been
``touted by advertisers and debated by nutrionists'' as dietary
supplements. In any case, the capsules, it said, have become
popular with any consumers hoping to ease or prevent conditions
ranging from heart disease to rheumatoid arthritis.
   Emken led the study at the agency's Northern Regional Research
Center at Peoria, Ill., and was helped in the work by St. Francis
Medical Center in Peoria.
   ``Our study is the first to show that linolenic acid is rapidly
converted to omega-3 fatty acids found in marine oil,'' Emken said.
``The study also provides direction for further research to learn
which dietary fatty acids, including those in fish and soybeans,
best meet human nutritional needs.''
   Soybean oil is the only major domestic vegetable oil that
contains much linolenic acid and makes up 79 percent of the
vegetable fats in the average U.S. diet, the report said. The fats
are in such foods as shortening, margarine and cooking oil as well
as in salad dressing.

   One of the decisive factors in Iran's decision
to accept a cease-fire with Iraq was a prediction by the radical
Revolutionary Guards that they could not achieve any victory over
the Iraqis until 1993, according to a document released Tuesday.
   The Peoples' Mujahedeen of Iran, a group seeking to overthrow
the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, released what it
said was a transcript of a July 17 meeting at which the decision to
adopt a cease-fire was announced to the senior Iranian leadership.
   The detailed transcript sheds light on the Iranian decision,
which has not been publicly explained and has led to much
speculation.
   The authenticity of the document could not be independently
verified, but previous documents released by the organization have
proved generally reliable.
   ``Now that our military officials ... openly admit that the Army
of Islam will not achieve any victories whatsoever in the near
future ... I accept the cease-fire,'' said Khomeini in a message to
the gathering read by his son Ahmad.
   The ailing leader did not take part in the eight-hour meeting,
which was attended by some 40 people including Parliament Speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani, President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Hussein
Musavi and senior military officers.
   In his message, Khomeini cited specifically ``the shocking
letter of the Guards Corps commander'' Mahsen Rezaij, who sought to
continue the eight-year war.
   ``We won't have any victories in the next five years,'' Khomeini
reportedly quoted the commander as saying. ``After 1993, if we have
250 brigades, 2,500 tanks, 3,000 armored personnel carriers, 300
aircraft and 300 helicopters, we believe, God willing, we will be
able to launch offensives,'' the letter reportedly said.
   Diplomatic sources have said Iran, chronically short of money
and isolated by an international embargo, was suffering severe
shortages of combat aircraft, tanks, radar and other weapons.
   Khomeini also said his government's bank accounts ``are below
zero'' and ``the people have no desire to go the fronts ...''
   In his address to the Iranian people on July 20 announcing the
cease-fire, Khomeini did not explain his reasons for what he said
was a ``very bitter and tragic issue for everyone.''
   In a series of Iraqi offensives earlier this year, Iran lost
virtually all the territory it had captured in the eight-year war.
   Rafsanjani described to the participants several Iranian losses,
citing the battle on Majnoon Island in which he said Iranian forces
retreated without suffering any casualties, leaving 70 boats for
the enemy. He said supplies were so low that Iranian forces didn't
even have sandbags.
   Other officials spoke of confusion within the military, the
deterioration of the economy and an energy shortage. The transcript
also recorded a harsh exchange between Khomeini's son and Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashami, who criticized the cease-fire
decision.
   But Khomeini's son defended his father. ``One day he said war.
Now he says peace. Tomorrow once again he might advocate war.
There's no contradiction in this.''

   The president of the World Jewish Congress said
Tuesday the East Germans have agreed to accept moral responsibility
and pay reparations for the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews,
but he would not give specifics.
   Edgar M. Bronfman also said he hoped for better relations
between East Germany and Israel, which have never recognized each
other diplomatically. ``I have been given the understanding that
serious consideration is being given to some renewal of
relationship,'' he said.
   Bronfman, 59, spoke to reporters at the end of a three-day visit
to East Germany that included meetings with Erich Honecker,
president and Communist Party chief; Foreign Minister Oskar
Fischer, and other officials.
   Before meeting Honecker, Bronfman said he expected a reparations
agreement. East Germany had said it would provide unspecified
``humanitarian aid'' to Holocaust victims.
   ``I have had very good, clear meetings here,'' Bronfman told the
news conference in East Berlin. ``I am totally satisfied on two
counts. The first is ... the moral position that East Germany is
taking on its responsibilities on the Holocaust. The second point
is payment to the sufferers and survivors.''
   He also referred to an international Claims Conference supported
by the World Jewish Conference, which in the past has handled
reparations issues for Holocaust victims.
   ``I understand that the negotiations that took place between the
(East German) government and the Claims Conference have been
completed,'' Bronfman said. ``They will be lived up to and the
details and communications will be worked out and reported.
   ``I am completely satisifed with the results. I have nothing
further to say on the payments question. It is not my
responsibility to discuss the details.''
   Bronfman was asked about a statement by Heinz Galinski, a West
German Jewish leader, that East Germany would pay up to $100
million, and replied: ``The $100 million was not part of my
mission.''
   East Germany has a chronic shortage of hard currency and has not
been expected to make substantial payments, but any offer of
reparations would be a major change from its previous policy.
   It has claimed since its founding in 1949 that it bears no
responsibility for Hitler's atrocities because it was created after
World War II, and has stressed that Communists also suffered under
Nazi persecution.
   West Germany has paid more than $48 billion to Holocaust victims
and their relatives since it signed a compensation agreement with
the World Jewish Congress in 1952.
   In recents months, East German official media have reported
government efforts to improve relations with practicing Jews in
East Germany, who number only 450-600.
   About East German pledges to renovate and maintain Jewish
synagogues and cemeteries, Bronfman said Tuesday: ``I'm very
satisfied with the symbolic arrangements.''
   The official East German news agency ADN covered the visit
extensively and reported Bronfman's remarks on the talks between
the Claims Conference and Honecker's government. A front-page story
in the Communist Party daily Neues Deutschland was accompanied by a
photograph of Bronfman and Honecker shaking hands.

   President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea
called Tuesday for a summit meeting with North Korean's president
to sign a non-aggression pact and said his country ``will never use
force first against the North.''
   In the first address by a Korean leader to the General Assembly,
Roh said such a summit should ``resolve all the problems raised by
either or both sides with regard to disarmament, arms control and
other military matters.''
   North Korea has said it only would accept a summit meeting after
42,000 U.S. troops pull out of the South.
   Roh also proposed the two Koreas meet with United States, the
Soviet Union, China and Japan to lay the groundwork for peace,
prosperity and security in Northeast Asia.
   Seoul's allies, including the United States, should ``contribute
to the progress and opening of North Korea by engaging Pyongyang in
expanding relations,'' the president told the 159-member world body.
   Roh also called for a Korean trade and cultural center on the
38th Parallel dividing North and South, where divided families
could visit in a ``city of peace.''
   Western diplomats hailed Roh's speech, which drew prolonged
applause, but there was no immediate comment from North Korea, the
Soviet Union or China.
   Ambassador Pak Gil Yon of North Korea was present in the
assembly chamber, but left without speaking to reporters.
   In Pyongyang, President Kim Il Sung accused South Korea and the
United States on Tuesday of ``maneuvering'' to perpetuate the
division of the Korean Peninsula, the official Korean Central News
Agency said.
   The agency, monitored in Tokyo, said Kim spoke at a banquet
several hours before Roh's U.N. speech. Kim again urged peace and
the removal of U.S. troops.
   Roh, in his speech, said improved relations and trust between
the two Koreas could ultimately lead to the reunification of the
peninsula, divided since World War II.
   ``Even before a non-aggression declaration is made with the
Northern side, the Republic of Korea will never use force first
against the North,'' Roh said.
   ``We must do everything possible to hasten the coming of the
springtime for peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula,''
he said.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters, the permanent U.N.
representative, praised the speech as ``one of the most historic
and statesman-like speeches I have heard in this hall.''
   Japanese Ambassador Hideo Kagami said ``we hope very much that
today's speech will contribute to dialogue, reduction of tensions
and reconciliation.''
   On Wednesday, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kang Sok
Ju, will address the world body.
   The appearance of the South Korean president and North Korean
deputy foreign minister is the result of a compromise. The United
States, Japan, Canada and other nations proposed last summer that
South Korea should speak on the 40th anniversary of its 1948
founding.
   China, the Soviet Union and other socialist nations opposed the
idea, saying a speech to observe one national day only would fan
tensions since the Korean Peninsula was divided.
   It later was decided both sides would speak separately on the
question of reconciliation and dialogue.
   The two Koreas hold U.N. non-voting observer status because
their peninsula is divided and they still technically are at war.
The 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice and no peace treaty
was signed.
   On Thursday, Roh meets President Reagan in Washington.

   The governors of seven states and about
1,000 business and government leaders from Japan and the Southeast
will meet here this week to talk about doing business with each
other.
   They are delegates to the joint annual meeting of the Southeast
United States-Japan Association and its Japanese counterpart, the
Japan-Southeast United States Association.
   The groups, which foster business investment and trade between
Japan and the Southeast, held their first meeting in 1976.
   They alternate their yearly sessions between Japan and the
United States. This is the first time they've met in South Carolina.
   ``Japanese interest is acute in the Southeastern United
States,'' said Curt Cottle, spokesman for the South Carolina
Development Board.
   ``A two-day meeting won't solve the trade imbalance,'' but it
has the advantage of giving leaders a chance to talk face-to-face,
he said.
   Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and
Virginia are the other states represented in the association.
   While the states are usually in keen competition for industrial
investment, for the meeting ``we need regional cooperation to pull
it off. One state alone couldn't stage a conference like this,''
Cottle said.
   Cottle said there's been extensive Japanese investment in the
Atlanta area, but this year has brought some good news for South
Carolina, as well.
   Since the first of the year, Japanese investment in the state
has totaled more than $127 million, he said.

   Israel's Supreme Court barred U.S.-born Rabbi
Meir Kahane on Tuesday from running in the Nov. 1 election, calling
his anti-Arab Kach movement racist.
   The unanimous ruling was expected to benefit the right-wing
Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in its close race with
the left-leaning Labor Party.
   An angry Kahane, speaking at a news conference, urged backers to
boycott the vote. One agitated activist tore up his Israeli
indentification card needed for voting, scuffled with bystanders
and was dragged out of the room.
   The court also ruled the Progressive List for Peace, which calls
for an independent Palestinian state, could compete in the
elections. The Likud had demanded the party's ouster for allegedly
seeking to destroy Israel's Jewish character.
   In its unanimous ruling on Kach, the court found that Kahane
incites ``racism and negates the democratic character of the
state.''
   The 56-year-old, Brooklyn, N.Y.-born founder of the militant
Jewish Defense League demands the ouster of all Arabs from
Israeli-held territory and a ban on Jewish-Arab marriages. The
movement's symbol is a clenched fist inside a Star of David.
   The court ruled on a Kach appeal against a decision by the
Central Elections Committee to bar the movement from the elections.
The decision was based on a 1985 law banning parties advocating
racism and opposing Israel's Jewish or democratic character.
   But Kahane said there was a ``contradiction between Zionism and
democracy,'' noting that Israel's Law of Return discriminates
against non-Jews by granting automatic citizenship only to Jews.
   He spoke during a chaotic news conference that was repeatedly
interrupted by supporters chanting ``Kahane, king of Israel.''
   Kahane urged supporters to boycott the elections, saying he
wanted to punish Likud, which had joined Labor in supporting Kach's
ouster from the race.
   Kahane won a seat in the 120-member Parliament in 1984 after
three failed attempts.
   Analysts said many Kach supporters would probably ignore the
boycott call, and support the extreme right-wing parties Tsomet and
Moledet instead of Likud.
   Shamir said Tuesday his party would not make a special appeal to
Kach voters. But even if potential Kach voters switch to other
right-wing parties, Likud would benefit because potential coalition
partners would be strengthened.
   The Supreme Court, meanwhile, rejected demands by Likud and the
right-wing Tehiya Party that the Progressive List for Peace should
be barred from the election because it allegedly seeks to destroy
Israel's Jewish character by negotiating with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Likud and Tehiya first challenged the PLP in the Elections
Committee and then took their case to the Supreme Court.
   Also Tuesday, Shamir told reporters that the struggle of
Palestinians to achieve independence was ``useless'' and that there
would never be a Palestinian state.
   Likud's campaign platform, published Tuesday, suggested that
Shamir would annex the occupied territories if elected.
   ``Israel has a right and a claim to sovereignty over Judea,
Samaria and the Gaza District,'' the platform read, using the
biblical names for the West Bank. ``Israel will raise this claim
and act toward implementing this right.''

   Leftist students occupied the downtown
campus building of an independent U.S.-affiliated college Tuesday
to protest private education.
   ``Education isn't for sale, it's for everyone!'' chanted the
more than 1,000 students, who also burned a U.S. flag from the
balcony of the building housing a department of Southeastern
College.
   ``No private university should be allowed to operate here ... we
must struggle to safeguard the public character of our education
system if we want to strengthen our studies,'' the protesters said
in a statement.
   All levels of education in Greece, including books and
accomodation are state-funded, although more than 100 private
primary and secondary schools also operate.
   Some independent higher education institutions also exist, but
degrees gained at private colleges are not recognized by the
socialist government.
   ``These people feel that private American education doesn't have
the right to exist in Greece because they complain that it creates
a kind of elite,'' said Achilles Kanellopoulos, dean of
Southeastern College.
   ``They're wrong as many of our students who cannot afford the
fees receive financial aid, he said.

   President Reagan telephoned the commander of a
whale rescue operation in Alaska on Tuesday to offer his support,
telling him that Americans' ``hearts are with you and our prayers
are also with you'' in the effort to save three mammals trapped by
ice in the Arctic Sea.
   Reagan, in a five-minute call to Col. Tom Carroll of the Alaska
Army National Guard, said he was ``very concerned'' about the
plight of the mammals and wanted an ``on-site report'' from Alaska.
The conversation was piped into the White House press room.
   The endangered California gray whales became trapped 18 miles
northeast of Barrow, Alaska, while migrating south to warmer
waters. The 24-to-30-foot-long mammals were bleeding and battered
from continually bashing into the jagged ice for nearly two weeks.
   Reagan said he had monitored the situation by watching
television.
   ``I just wanted to tell you that everybody down here, their
hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you,'' he told
Carroll, who was at a base camp at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, about 200
miles southeast of the whales.
   ``Anything that we can say or do to help you along with the
success of the operation, we'd be pleased to do it,'' the president
added.
   Carroll explained to the president details in the planned
operation in which a National Guard Skycrane helicopter was to tow
a 185-ton Hovercraft-type ice-breaking barge from Prudhoe Bay to
the whales.
   The operation was delayed for several hours because the owner
wanted to make sure it was totally safe to operate in the harsh
environment, Carroll said.
   He said that while the National Guard is coordinating the
operation, private companies and groups such as Greenpeace and the
National Marine Fisheries Service are also involved.
   ``It's extremely moving when you see the interest that has been
generated not only here but across the nation,'' Carroll said.
   He added that Reagan's call was a morale-booster for the crews
working in sub-freezing weather.
   ``This is the kind of thing that kind of makes it all
worthwhile,'' he said. But the big moment will come when the whales
are safe, he added.

   The disease AIDS could claim 50 million lives
throughout the world in the 1990s, exceeding the toll of the Black
Plague in the Middle Ages, according to the World Future Society.
   The AIDs prediction was the grimmest of scores of forecasts by
the society in the November-December edition of its magazine, The
Futurist. It said millions of Americans may become ill with AIDS,
at an economic cost to the nation of $66 billion, even though the
disease, whose chief victims have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug users, is not likely to spread rapidly within the
heterosexual population.
   The World Health Organization estimates that as many as 10
million people worldwide may be infected with AIDS, with 1 million
new cases possible by 1993. As of Oct. 10, AIDS had been diagnosed
in 75,437 Americans, of whom more than half, or 42,432, have died
since June 1, 1981, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   On the positive side, the World Future Society foresees better
living conditions both at home and on the job. Technology will help
more Americans live in dream houses, with home theaters,
housekeeping robots and backyard edens, it said. It predicted
employers will offer more family-oriented benefits, including
on-site child care, flexible working hours and time off to care for
sick children.
   The predictions summarize a wide range of reports published
during the past year by the society, a nonprofit educational group
based in Bethesda, Md., which encourages research into issues
affecting the future.
   It predicted a continued rebirth of inner cities, with a trend
toward more greenery in downtown areas and an interspersing of
entertainment and cultural facilities, such as art museums and
aquariums, within shopping areas.
   The society said the AIDS epidemic could have some positive
effects if it leads to national health insurance systems and
promotes a boom in medical research that could benefit all areas of
health care.
   Other projections:
   _The economic rivalry between the United States and Japan could
lead to serious trade wars and security differences. Japanese
control of the most advanced semiconductor technology by the 1990s
could further erode U.S. economic strength.
   _Computer networks and telecommunications facilities, including
those operated by the military, will become popular targets for
terrorists.
   _Businesses will need to provide continuous employee training as
the automation and computer revolutions eliminate many low-literacy
jobs.
   _Fraud may become the crime of choice in the future as America
grows older, replacing burglary, which requires the agility of
youth.
   _New discoveries in biotechnology and generic engineering could
lead to the replacement of nerve cells, arteries, hormone-producing
cells and even brain cells. Artificial implants will become more
common.
   _If current trends continue, the United States will face a
shortage of 1.2 million nurses by the year 2000.

   The nation's factories are booming thanks to
strong export sales, but a slight slowdown late this summer has
left manufacturers cautious about next year, the Federal Reserve
Board said Tuesday.
   ``Manufacturers are becoming less optimistic about coming
months'' despite current strength, the Federal Reserve said in a
review of the economy based on reports from its 12 regional banks.
   The report lends new weight to the prevailing view of economists
that the Fed will refrain from pushing interest rates higher at
least until after the Nov. 8 elections and possibly until early
next year.
   ``Virtually every district indicates continuing strength or
expansion in the industrial sector. Many cite rising exports as a
primary source of demand,'' said the Fed report, known internally
as the ``tan book.''
   The expansion encompasses a wide range of industries, including
chemicals, paper and pulp, steel, autos and trucks and machinery,
it said.
   However, it added, ``several districts say a slight slowdown
became evident in late summer and that manufacturers, forseeing a
leveling-off of activity through the first half of 1989, have
become very cautious.''
   The report will be used as a starting point for discussions when
Fed policymakers gather on Nov. 1 to map monetary strategy.
   Manufacturing, aided by an export boom fueled by the lower value
of the dollar, has led economic growth this year. But demand has
been so strong that analysts have worried it will cause production
bottlenecks and higher prices.
   In an effort to fight inflation by curbing demand, the Fed
pushed up interest rates from late March through early August.
Reports from the district banks prompted the board's most dramatic
move on Aug. 9. It raised a key bank lending rate, the discount
rate, from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.
   The central bank has refrained from further tightening moves
since then, waiting to see if economic growth slows to what it
considers a sustainable, non-inflationary pace.
   In other economic sectors, the report found:
   _The summer ``drought will have a much smaller impact on farm
income than was originally thought.'' A fall in crop yields has
been largely offset by higher prices and federal aid to farmers.
   _Retail trade, particularly women's clothing, is ``weak or slow
in most areas.'' However, car sales have been strong in most
districts.
   _The decline in oil prices has hurt the Dallas area, which
reported a 14 percent decline in oil wells since May. The impact
has been less severe in other areas.
   _Most districts reported weaker housing construction as builders
anticipate higher interest rates. Two districts _ Atlanta and St.
Louis _ noted softening home prices. Although business lending is
strong, mortgage lending has tapered off.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Call for Vietnamese Withdrawal From Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Tuesday signed with
reservations a House resolution calling for the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and establishment of a free and
independent government in that country.
   Reagan said he welcomed ``this clear statement of principles''
on Cambodia, but he disagreed with certain clauses which he feared
could complicate efforts to ensure that Khmer Rouge rebels never
again attain power.
   The House resolution stipulates that the Cambodian people be
protected from the return of a Khmer Rouge, who, under Pol Pot in
the late 1970s, are thought to have slaughtered as many as 2
million people.
   Reagan did not specify his reservations, but a White House
official said the president's main problem was language in the
resolution which didn't conform exactly to U.S. policy.
   The United States wants a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in the
context of an ``overall settlement'' in Cambodia, said the
official, speaking on condition he not be named. The resolution did
not mention the overall settlement, he said.
   Reagan, however, said he signed the non-binding resolution
because it ``makes clear that the United States will continue to do
everything possible to assure that the Vietnamese occupation of
Cambodia is brought to an end and that effective guarantees are put
into place to prevent the Khmer Rouge from ever again taking
control of Cambodia.''
   Vietnam, which has installed a puppet government in Cambodia,
announced earlier this year that it would withdraw its 120,000
troops from the nearby country by 1990.
   The withdrawal, however, will leave a vaccuum. The United States
provides non-lethal assistance to two non-communist groups,
including one headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former chief
of state. Sihanouk met last week with Reagan.
   Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge receives support from China and Thailand.

<TEXT>
   A mechanic on Tuesday became the first
person arraigned for allegedly violating Florida's new law banning
obscene bumper stickers, and the American Civil Liberties Union
said it might challenge the statute's constitutionality.
   Glenn Wallace Beasley, 24, pleaded innocent to the second-degree
misdemeanor in Collier County Court. He also pleaded innocent to
several other misdemeanor traffic and parole violations.
   If Beasley is convicted of violating the obscenity statute,
which took effect Oct. 1, he could face up to six months in jail
and a $500 fine. Penalties double for repeated violations.
   With or without the ACLU's help, his attorney said, he will ask
a judge to dismiss the obscenity charge.
   ``My gut reaction is I don't think it's constitutional,'' said
Assistant Public Defender Phillip Roach in Naples. ``It gives the
arresting police officer total discretion to decide what's
obscene.''
   Beasley was picked up Friday night in what apparently was the
first application of the law passed this spring. Rep. Tom Banjanin
proposed the ban because of a proliferation of stickers like the
one spotted on Beasley's truck.
   It sported a popular but scatological version of the saying,
``things happen.''
   Charlene Carres, a lobbyist with the ACLU in Tallahassee, said
she would consult with the group's headquarters in New York about
intervening in the case.
   She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court set precedent on the issue
of obscenity in the 1960s in a California case in which a draft
protester wearing a T-shirt denigrating the Selective Service was
arrested after he walked into a courthouse.
   The high court ruled that the T-shirt's slogan was protected
under First Amendment rights of free speech because it pertained to
the government.
   ``I suspect there could be an action brought,'' Carres said. ``I
don't see a difference between a T-shirt and a bumper sticker.''
   State Rep. Art Simon, who helped draft the bumper sticker ban,
said the new law simply adds bumper stickers to other forms of
printed and recorded media already covered by state obscenity laws
and leaves to the courts to define what obscenity means.
   Simon said he wasn't surprised that the law is headed for a
challenge, but questioned how much the California case would help
Beasley.
   ``One is going to be hard-pressed to make an analogous argument
that something which is a normal bodily function is, in and of
itself, an expression of political belief,'' said Simon, an
attorney. ``I think we have regulated the subject matter to the
fullest extent allowed under the Constitution and now it will
require a case-by-case analysis.''
   State Attorney Joseph D'Alessandro of Collier County said he
didn't think Beasley's case would make a good test for civil
libertarians because of the other traffic charges filed against him.
   He predicted Beasley would end up entering a plea bargain on
those charges.
   In the meantime, the prosecutor isn't making clean bumpers a
priority in Collier County.
   ``(The police aren't) really going out and instructing their
people to start making arrests for bumper stickers,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the sheriff's office said that while the statute
may not generate a lot of prosecutions based only on bumper-sticker
charges, it will provide officers with another reason to stop
suspicious vehicles.
   ``It's going to be a tool for the officer. If they've got the
obscene stickers, it's one more (probable cause) to stop
somebody,'' said Lt. Steve Riley.

Associates of Cambridge and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill of New York
_ in their submission for the renovation of the huge Sprague
Electric Co. plant into a museum to house major collections of 20th
century art.
   Their team was chosen by a panel of international art experts
and local businessmen and politicians after a two-day study of 23
proposals for revamping the factory.
   Joseph Thompson, the director of the museum's executive planning
group, said the architects were chosen because of their reputation.
Gehry designed the temporary building housing the Los Angeles
Museum of Contemporary Art, called the ``Temporary Contemporary,''
and Venturi is working on a wing to the National Gallery of Art in
London.
   Both men are known for their odd contemporary designs. Venturi,
for example, once designed a building painted in paisley swirls.
   Thompson, however, said the architects have ``a proven
reputation for sensitivity to the context of a project and have
shown sympathy for the industrial setting of the site itself.''
   The setting for the planned Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary
Art is a 28-building factory in an industrial city in the state's
remote northwest corner.
   Among the proposals submitted was a design from Coop Himmelblau
of Los Angeles for a giant contemporary sculpture of straps and
metal above the factory. Gae Aulenti of Milan, Italy, submitted an
inch-thick book of photographs of her projects, including the Gare
D'Orsay, a Paris museum created from a train station.
   Architect Resources of Cambridge suggested a glass tower and
Cesar Pelli & Associates of New Haven, Conn., proposed a large
contemporary tower in a courtyard to contrast with the factory's
clock tower.
   The winning team did not submit a specific design proposal.
Thompson said the team will begin working on design and engineering
prototypes, and cost and market analyses for a $1.7 million study
on the project's feasibility.
   The study will be turned over to the state Office of
Administration and Finance, which must approve it before releasing
$33 million in funds earmarked by the Legislature for the
renovation.

   President Reagan on Tuesday signed into law a
bill that will enable local governments to help children abandoned
in hospitals, particularly those with AIDS or drug dependencies.
   The measure provides for more than $20 million in demonstration
grants to go to local governments over three years to tackle the
problem.

   Higher commodity prices mean less grain and
other items going to needy countries under the Food for Peace
program in 1988-89, a report by the Agriculture Department showed
Tuesday.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said allocations for
the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 total about 3 million metric tons
of grain equivalent valued at $663 million.
   Under the program a year ago, allocations totaled 4.4 million
tons of food commodities worth $648 million.
   Despite the dollar increase, higher prices for grain and some
other commodities have resulted in lower tonnages for the new year.
For example, a year ago about 3.8 million tons of wheat flour were
allocated. In the new allocation, wheat flour totaled less than 2.5
million tons.
   The Food for Peace program includes titles that allow
concessional sales to designated countries for up to 40 years,
including an initial 10-year grace period and low interest rates.
   Another allows the forgiveness of debt incurred under the
concessional sales, based on development carried out by the
recipient countries.
   Goldberg said $139.5 million in unallocated funds has been set
aside as a reserve to provide commodities ``for unforeseen needs''
during the year. Last year the reserve was $85.6 million.
   The largest allocations went to Egypt, $170 million; Pakistan,
$80 million, and Bangladesh, $60 million.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Says Iran Has New Weapon to Deter Iraq</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian leader said Tuesday that the
Persian Gulf war could resume, but that Iran has a new mystery
weapon with which to deter Iraq from resuming attacks on cities.
   Tehran radio quoted Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian
parliament and military commander-in-chief, as saying the
``probability exists'' that the 8-year-old war with Iraq could
break out again.
   He said Iran considers itself ``neither in a state of war nor a
state of peace,'' despite a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire that took
effect Aug. 20.
   Rafsanjani said Iran had acquired a ``device'' to deter Iraq,
but did not describe it.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq claimed on Sept. 27 that his
country had developed a weapon only two other countries possessed.
He did not elaborate, but said it was not a chemical device.
   Iran and Iraq each has sought in some degree to develop nuclear
capability. Israel bombed a French-built nuclear plant west of
Baghdad in 1981 to curb Iraq's potential.
   Western military analysts dismissed the possibility that
Rafsanjani was referring to a nuclear device. Some military
analysts consulted by The Associated Press said the Iranians may
have a new medium-range missile capable of hitting Iraqi cities.
   Most found it more likely that Rafsanjani was engaging in a game
of bluff with Iraq, which demonstrated during the last round of the
``war of the cities'' earlier this year that it had a greater
supply of effective missiles.
   The radio said Rafsanjani commented after a three-day tour of
Iran's devastated western region.
   It quoted him as saying: ``We must not forget that our enemy
might have the same motives of the past, although it will not
easily welcome the danger of resuming the war because of the
situation it has encountered. But the possibility exists.''
   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq stalled almost as soon as they
began in Geneva five days after the cease-fire date. Iraq insists
on sovereignty over the entire Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms
the southern border and is its only outlet to the sea.

   In the years after it was founded in
1943, Radcliffe College's Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library
on the History of Women in America was a sleepy place with few
visitors, curators say.
   But with its official reopening Tuesday after a $3.5 million
renovation, the library is sleepy no longer. After its humble
beginnings in two small rooms in the basement of a building on the
Radcliffe campus, the library now occupies the entire structure.
   Because of the interest sparked in women's studies by the
feminist movement, the number of visiting researchers now numbers
about 5,000 per year.
   The library, the only one of its kind in the nation, collects
materials on women's roles and contributions from 1800 to the
present. It includes a collection so varied that one can study
aviatrix Amelia Earhart's papers, research the early women's
suffrage movement, peruse 5,000 cookbooks or review former first
lady Eleanor Roosevelt's ``Book of Common Sense Etiquette.''
   The red-brick building in Radcliffe Yard houses rooms for
visiting scholars, film and videotape viewing rooms for oral
history projects, photography exhibits, 500 women's
interest-periodicals, a planned wooden relief by sculptress Louise
Nevelson and the 5,000-volume Julia Child Study Area, named for the
famed chef.
   ``It's like a quantum jump in the recognition that real women's
issues and history are here to stay,'' said Eva Moseley, curator of
manuscripts, who has been at the library since 1971.
   Alongside oil portraits of Lydia Pinkham, who marketed a
well-known patent remedy for women's illnesses, and stained glass
artist Sarah Wyman Whitman, visitors can examine more than 30,000
books that concern women. On exhibit are memorabilia from the
women's suffrage movement: rattlers shaken by women in suffrage
parades, banners and placards reading ``Keep Cool! There Will Be
Nothing to Worry About After we Get VOTES FOR WOMEN!''
   Elizabeth Shenton, assistant to the library director, said the
library was almost a closet when she began work there 21 years ago.
   ``We were in two little rooms,'' she recalled. ``It was such an
event when one researcher came that we offered them tea. But the
women's movement increased interest in us so much. It just
ballooned.''
   The library was launched in 1943 as the Women's Rights
Collection using papers donated to the college from suffragist Maud
Park Wood, a member of Radcliffe's class of 1898.
   The collection opened to the public in 1949 with 300 books and
1,156 manuscripts. In 1965, the library was renamed to honor
Harvard history professor, Schlesinger, and his wife, who was a
historian of women and active in the League of Women Voters. Their
son, historian Arthur Jr., has said that his mother ``raised my
father's consciousness.''
   In later years, the library began to focus on the contributions
women have made to domestic life. An exhibit of etiquette books,
such as ``No Nice Girls Swear,'' is on display.
   One of the most unusual collections consists of cookbooks from
the 1800s to the present, stacked in shelves near a huge, blown-up
photograph of Child. Her papers are also part of the library.
   Gina DeAngelis, 25, a third-year student at Boston University
Law School, was at the library Tuesday researching women's unions
in the 1940s for a legal history class.
   ``This is the only library where I could find this material,''
she said.
   Museum staffer Nancy Falk said that for years women studying at
colleges in the area were unaware of the library's existence.
   ``All of sudden, though, women are a legitimate field of
study,'' she said.
   The renovation of the existing 1908 building was financed by
more than 3,500 gifts and grants.

   A technician who plugged a connector
into the wrong receptacle caused a flash electrical fire that did
minor damage to the $216 million Magellan Venus probe being readied
for a space shuttle launch next year, NASA reported Tuesday.
   Smoke and a 2-to-3-inch flame spurted from a spacecraft battery
when the worker tried to insert the cable connector into the wrong
slot Monday night, Magellan project official Vince Wirth said.
   ``Technicians on the scene quickly put out the fire within a
minute with a halon fire extinguisher,'' Wirth said. ``But by then
the damage was done. It resulted in a short that damaged the
battery and wire harness and insulation blankets near the battery.''
   He termed the damage minor and estimated it would take five to
seven days to get spacecraft preparation back on schedule. He said
there would be no impact on the April launch date aboard the
shuttle Atlantis.
   Wirth played a videotape made Tuesday that showed some soot
damage around the battery area. The battery, he explained, was
being used to run routine power system checks in the spacecraft's
forward equipment module and is not part of the flight hardware.
   He said the fire deposited ``some soot, grease and grime'' on
parts of the spacecraft and that it would have to be cleaned up. He
said Magellan, because of its planetary mission, has to be kept
extremely contamination-free and that cleaning experts were being
flown in from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
and from Martin Marietta in Denver, where the craft was built.
   Because an electrical short was involved, Wirth said engineers
were checking to make certain there was no damage to other
electrical components such as the spacecraft signal processor.
   In Washington, NASA administrator James C. Fletcher told
reporters, ``Apparently the wrong plug was put in the power supply
... I don't know whether you ever tried to put a multipronged plug
into a socket, but it's hard to do. It wouldn't fit, so he pushed
it a little bit and it shorted out the battery.
   ``We shouldn't allow this kind of stuff,'' Fletcher added.
``It's a human error ... we'll have an investigation and take some
steps so it won't happen in the future.''
   Wirth said the technician who made the mistake worked for Martin
Marietta, which delivered Magellan here on Oct. 8. The spacecraft
is being assembled and checked in a processing building. When fully
assembled, the craft will stand 21 feet tall and weigh 7,800 pounds.
   Wirth said because of the recent delivery, many electrical
components still had not been installed, reducing the possibility
of more damage, and several protective shipping covers were still
in place, cutting down on the spread of soot.
   Atlantis' astronaut crew is to release the spacecraft from the
cargo bay to start it on a 446-day trip to Venus. While Magellan
orbits the planet, its advanced radar will peer through the
constant clouds and map the surface.
   Before that mission, Atlantis has another flight assignment. It
is being readied here for a late November launch in which it is to
carry a classified Defense Department payload into orbit. A problem
with an actuator that controls the left wing flap has delayed for a
few days its transfer from a processing facility to an assembly
building where it will be joined with its two solid fuel booster
rockets and external fuel tank.
   A firm launch date will not be set until a flight readiness
review scheduled Nov. 9 and 10.
   The flight will be the second for the shuttle program since the
Challenger explosion in January 1986. Discovery completed a highly
successful mission on Oct. 3 and is now being groomed for a
February launch.

   Rep. Pat Swindall worked Tuesday on his
defense for next week's trial on 10 federal counts of perjury, even
as he celebrated his 38th birthday with a letter of congratulations
from President Reagan.
   Swindall, a second-term Republican who represents a suburban
Atlanta district, was indicted Monday on charges of lying to a
federal grand jury that was hearing evidence gathered during a
nationwide money laundering ``sting'' operation by the Internal
Revenue Service.
   Reagan did not mention the indictment in his birthday letter to
Swindall, which read in part, ``May your special day be filled with
joy and may the year to come bring you every happiness.''
   Swindall, who was granted an expedited trial after saying he
wanted to clear his name before the Nov. 8 election, said he has
received calls from several attorneys offering their assistance but
still intends to act as his own lawyer during the trial.
   Reminded of the adage that an attorney who represents himself
has a fool for a client, Swindall replied, ``We'll find out the day
after the jury comes back.''
   During an hour-long interview with two reporters, Swindall
appeared upbeat and relaxed, frequently joking in response to
questions about criminal charges that could send him to jail if he
is convicted.
   Asked if he intended to call any members of Congress or the
Reagan administration as character witnesses, Swindall said he
might, then quipped, ``I think everybody already knows I'm a
character.''
   Sitting at a desk covered with cassette tapes and transcripts
from conversations recorded during the IRS operation, Swindall
acknowledged that he has not tried a criminal case in seven years.
In fact, he said, he has tried only four criminal cases in his
entire career as an attorney, and in all of those he was assisted
by another lawyer.
   Still, Swindall said he will be ready Monday when jury selection
begins and will base his case on ``the ol' innocent defense.''
   The perjury charges against Swindall stem from his grand jury
testimony about discussions he had last year with Atlanta
businessman Charles LeChasney and Michael Mullaney, an undercover
IRS agent posing as a money broker, about an $850,000 home
mortagage loan he was seeking.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday welcomed
what he said was a trend toward democracy in Latin America and
cited a plebiscite in Chile as the latest example, Tass reported.
   The Soviet news agency said Gorbachev made the remarks in a
speech at a Kremlin dinner for President Jose Sarney of Brazil.
   ``Brazil's turn for democracy has been welcomed in the Soviet
Union,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying. ``It has represented a
powerful factor in a general tendency typical of Latin America over
recent years.''
   Tass said Gorbachev then noted the Oct. 5 plebiscite in Chile
and said it was part of the trend toward democracy in Latin America.
   ``The decisive popular `no' to the dictatorship in Chile has
reflected it graphically,'' Gorbachev told Sarney, according to
Tass.
   In the Chilean plebiscite, more than 3.9 million people voted
against the proposal that President Augusto Pinochet remain in
power until 1997. The ``yes'' vote was 3.1 million. Gen. Pinochet,
the army commander, has ruled Chile with a military government
since leading a 1973 coup that overthrew the government of elected
President Salvador Allende, a Marxist.
   Sarney became Brazil's first civilian president in 1985 after 21
years of right-wing military rule. From 1964-85, Brazil shunned
high-level contacts with the Soviet Union but maintained trade and
diplomatic ties.
   Sarney, who arrived Monday for a three-day stay, is the first
Brazilian head of state to visit the Soviet Union.
   In his dinner speech, Gorbachev said Brazil and the Soviet Union
should work together to preserve their vast forests. He said that
maintaining the great wooded areas of Siberia in the Soviet Union
and the Amazon River basin in Brazil ``is our common duty both
before the people of our countries and before mankind.''
   The Soviet leader also called for increased economic and
cultural ties and joint work in space.
   In his speech, Sarney called for increasing political, trade and
cultural ties.

   The Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem
appealed to President Reagan on behalf of Palestinians in
Israeli-occupied territories Tuesday and told U.S. officials he
hoped for official recognition of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Archbishop Michel Sabbah, the first Palestinian to hold the
Latin patriarch post, said he told Reagan at a 10-minute meeting
that ``the Jewish people are enjoying their human rights, the
Palestinians are not. Since 1967 they have been living under
Israeli military occupation.''
   The president said in response that he hopes for an end to
violence and peace in the area through negotiations, Sabbah told
reporters.
   Meanwhile, 17 past winners of Nobel prizes sent letters to the
leaders of Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria and the United States
urging negotiations to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
   The letters said: ``Negotiations can lead to a settlement which
embraces renunciation of terrorism and aggression and the
protection of minorities within a self-governed Palestinian
homeland.''
   ``All parties must at long last realize that they cannot have
peace without compromise and that there will be no chance of peace
without negotiation,'' said the Nobel laureates' letters.
   Sabbah said he had earlier conveyed to Secretary of State George
Shultz the Palestinian people's hopes that the PLO eventually will
be accepted as their spokesman.
   ``I mentioned that our representatives are the PLO ... we hope
that some day the Palestinians will have their rights and their
representatives,'' he said. Sabbah said the brief meeting did not
allow him to broach the PLO topic with Reagan.
   The U.S. and Israeli governments reject dealings with the PLO
because of its terrorist activity.
   Sabbah, whose diocese includes Israel, Jordan and Cyprus, is on
a month-long pastoral visit to the United States.
   Emphasizing that he spoke as a clergyman rather than politician,
he said, ``There are two peoples living in the Holy Land, the
Jewish people and the Palestinian people ... Both have inalienable
human rights ... justice demands giving the Jews and the
Palestinians the same human rights ....''
   In parts of the Holy Land, torn by an 11-month Palestinian
uprising and clashes with Israeli soldiers, the patriarch said,
``The oppressed and suffering are the Palestinians, so I must speak
for them. Were the oppressed and suffering the Jewish people, I
would equally plead their cause ... as the Latin patriarch ... my
concern is not only for Catholics, but for all peoples, Christians,
Moslems and Jews.''
   Archbishop Sabbah, born in Nazareth, was named Latin patriarch
by Pope John Paul II and ordained by him in Rome last January.
Previously, he had served seven years as president of the Catholic
University of Bethlehem.
   The Nobel laureates who signed the letters included Christian B.
Anfinsen, biochemistry, 1972; Julius Axelrod, biochemistry, 1970;
Hans Bethe, physics, 1967; Konrad Bloch, physiology and medicine,
1964; Val L. Fitch, physics, 1980; Walter Gilbert, chemistry, 1980;

   First lady Nancy Reagan ``broke her little
promise'' to stop accepting expensive designer gowns and jewelry
lent to her by leading couturiers, her press secretary said Tuesday.
   Spokeswoman Elaine Crispen said that when the practice came into
question in 1982, it was decided that Mrs. Reagan's transactions
would be reported on President Reagan's financial disclosure form.
She also acknowledged that the first lady vowed at the time to
discontinue accepting designer clothing.
   Sheila Tate, then-press secretary to Mrs. Reagan, told reporters
in February 1982 the first lady would stop accepting free clothing.
Her purpose was to help the fashion industry, but ``she felt it was
being misunderstood,'' Mrs. Tate said.
   ``Basically, she set her own little rule,'' Mrs. Crispin said
Tuesday. ``She made a promise not to do this again and she broke
her little promise because she just didn't feel she had to do it.''
   Meanwhile, the Office of Government Ethics reaffirmed its 1982
decision that such disclosures on Reagan's financial forms were not
technically required under the Ethics in Government Act.
   Deputy director Donald Campbell said: ``At this time, there is
no belief here in the office that the decision was not the correct
one.''
   But Campbell also said that officials would reassess the
situation ``if there's any indication of an error that we made.''
   The ethics law requires reporting by an official, or by the
official's spouse, of any loans in excess of $10,000 in any year.
   In 1984, then-Rep. George V. Hansen, R-Idaho, was convicted in
federal court of failing to disclose on his ethics form two loans
made to his wife by Texas millionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt. Hansen
served 11 months in prison.
   Questions about Mrs. Reagan's dealings with designers dominated
the White House news briefing for a second consecutive day.
   Pressed to discuss what implications Mrs. Reagan's
clothes-acquisition proclivities might have on the president's tax
forms and financial disclosure forms, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said: ``As far as we're concerned, there's no consequence ... for
the president's financial disclosure form or his tax forms, period.
   ``There is no legal problem. There is no ethical problem,'' he
said. ``There are all kinds of innuendo and insinuations of
illegality and improprieties that are totally incorrect.''
   In a May 4, 1982, letter, then-White House counsel Fred F.
Fielding told J. Jackson Walter, director of the Office of
Government Ethics:
   ``We have agreed that the practice of making the clothing and
other (personal property) available for the first lady's use does
not constitute a `gift' within the meaning of that term in the
Ethics in Government Act of 1978, and therefore it need not be
reported in the president's financial disclosure form.''
   Fielding went on to say that ``I advised, nonetheless, that
although there is no requirement to list these uses, nor manner in
which to evaluate them, the president's report should err on the
side of disclosure.''
   Walter initialed the letter with his approval and returned it to
Fielding.
   Mrs. Reagan has been borrowing expensive gowns and other
merchandise since 1982 without any disclosures, her spokeswoman had
acknowledged. But Mrs. Crispen said these clothes have been
returned.
   Mrs. Reagan's transactions during 1981 were reported
subsequently on a gifts attachment to the disclosure form the
president filed late in May 1982.
   Mrs. Crispen on Monday denied that Mrs. Reagan has kept any of
the expensive items, although she said the first lady ``regrets
that she failed to heed'' Fielding's advice to report the
transactions anyhow.
   At his news briefing Tuesday, Fitzwater was peppered with
questions. When asked what the president thought about the story,
he replied that Reagan considers it ``a cheap political shot
against the first lady.''

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Lawmakers' Claim on War Powers Act in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court dismissed a claim by
110 members of Congress that President Reagan should have invoked
the 1983 War Powers Resolution when Navy ships were sent to the
Persian Gulf last year, the court said Tuesday.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington said the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war had rendered
the war-powers issue moot.
   The ruling was made by Circuit Judges Patricia Wald, Harry
Edwards and Stephen Williams in a brief order filed Monday and made
public Tuesday.
   The panel had been asked to review a lower court's dismissal
last year of the lawsuit on the ground that it presented a
political question upon which judges cannot rule.
   The appeals court, however, dismissed the case without deciding
that question.
   The issue in the case filed by Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., and 109
colleagues was whether President Reagan should have notified
Congress within 48 hours of sending Navy ships to escort reflagged
Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf last year.
   The 1983 War Powers Resolution requires the president, in the
absence of a declaration of war, to notify Congress whenever U.S.
forces are sent into hostilities.
   The lawmakers claimed they were denied participation in the
warmaking process because Reagan did not submit notice. Under the
resolution, the president must withdraw forces within 60 days
absent a declaration or war or seek an extension from Congress.
   The members of Congress ``can claim no present injury as a
result of their reduced ability to participate in a process which
has been completed,'' the court said.
   ``Appellants' assertion of continuing injury is thus logically
dependent upon their ability to demonstrate that hostilities are
currently present or imminent. That demonstration cannot be made,''
the court said.
   One of the plaintiffs, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said the
court's decision ``was a disaster for the War Powers Resolution and
the Constitution.''
   ``Future presidents will have no hesitation (to ignore) the
clear requirements of this law. ... As of today, the War Powers
Resolution isn't worth the paper it was printed on,'' he said in a
statement.
   The court had asked both sides to file briefs on how the
cease-fire between Iran and Iraq affected the case.
   Lawmakers argued in their brief that U.S. forces still faced
imminent hostilities because the cease-fire between the two
countries is unstable.
   But the court said the court could not decide the merits of that
claim because it ``would require an inquiry into the likely
intentions of the Iranian and Iraqi governments'' that is ``beyond
the judicial competence.''

<HEAD>Peyote Use OK in Indian Ceremonies, Court Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of the hallucinogenic drug peyote in
American Indian religious ceremonies is protected by the First
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the state Supreme Court ruled
Tuesday.
   The ruling concerns two former Douglas County drug counselors
who were fired and denied jobless benefits for using the drug
during American Indian religious ceremonies.
   Peyote is a cactus that contains mescaline, an illegal
hallucinogenic drug. The drug long has been used in ceremonies of
the American Indian church, even though peyote possession is a
felony.
   Tuesday's ruling echoed the court's 1986 decision in which it
said denying jobless benefits to Alfred Smith and Galen Black
violated their constitutional rights to freely practice religion.
   Attorney Suanne Lovendahl said the ruling ``puts the Native
American Church on equal footing with majority religions in this
country.''
   ``This case shows our constitutional system does work and it
does protect people who are out of the mainstream,'' Lovendahl said.
   Deputy Attorney General Bill Gary said the state hasn't decided
whether to seek further court review of the case. However, Gary
expressed concern the ruling would set a precedent.
   ``Clearly, if some forms of drug use must be permitted under the
constitution because they are religiously motivated, (the courts)
are going to have to deal with other claims of religious
exemptions,'' he said.
   The case had earlier reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which sent
it back to the state court for a definitive ruling on whether
peyote could be legally used in religious ceremonies in Oregon.
   In arguments before the state Supreme Court earlier this year,
the attorney general's office said the state has constitutional
authority to impose a ban on all uses of peyote.
   The Supreme Court, in Tuesday's decision, noted that Oregon laws
against the possession of controlled substances, including peyote,
``make no exception for the sacramental use of peyote.''
   At the same time, the court said that the ``outright prohibition
of good faith religious use of peyote by adult members of the
Native American Church would violate the First Amendment directly
and as interpreted by Congress.''

<HEAD>Guardian Recommends Approval of Settlement in Ford Estate Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired judge appointed to look
after the financial interests of minor and unborn heirs to Henry
Ford II's estate has recommended approval of a proposed settlement.
   Retired Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Robert Hewitt, acting as
guardian ad litem for four minor grandchildren and unborn
grandchildren and great-grandchildren, said the proposed settlement
protects their financial interests. He recommended Circuit Judge
Vaughn Rudnick approve the settlement.
   Rudnick's ruling on the proposed settlement was delayed Sept. 26
when an attorney representing the grandchildren suggested
appointment of such a guardian.
   All attorneys involved were pleased with Hewitt's recommendation.
   ``I anticipated that he would approve it and I'm delighted that
he did,'' said Robert Montgomery, an attorney representing Kathleen
DuRoss Ford, third wife and widow of the automotive heir.
   ``The real benefit is that now the trust can get on with the
administration and not be bogged down in the sniping,'' said
attorney Arthur England, also representing Mrs. Ford.
   Rudnick's ruling, expected in the next few days, should settle
the widow's lawsuit challenging the administration of the trust.
   She and Edsel Ford II, Henry Ford's son by a previous marriage,
had disagreed over how the money should be invested, which attorney
would be counsel for the trust, and whether the trust should pay
family friend William Donaldson $1 million a year to manage the
money as a third trustee.
   Specific terms of the settlement have not been disclosed, but
Mrs. Ford's attorneys said she withdrew her objection to Donaldson.
Donaldson's payments under the settlement haven't been disclosed.
   Mrs. Ford is entitled to receive a minimum of $1.5 million a
year from the trust.
   Ford died at age 70 on Sept. 29, 1987, in Detroit. He filed his
will, which contained little information, in Palm Beach County,
which was his legal residence.
   The family hoped to avoid a public airing of their dispute, but
it erupted when Mrs. Ford objected to the selection of Donaldson, a
former undersecretary of state.

   A man wearing a headband with
anti-American slogans jumped from the fourth-floor window of a
campus building Tuesday, and 400 students clashed with riot police
in anti-government protests.
   Officials at Seoul's Yonsei University said the man wrapped
himself in a large South Korean national flag, shouted slogans
against the United States and the government of President Roh
Tae-woo, and then jumped.
   They identified him as Kim Kyong-ku, 32, a laborer and said he
was hospitalized with two broken legs.
   Ritualistic suicide is often used by radical students and
dissidents in South Korea to dramatize their cause.
   Elsewhere in the capital, about 400 students from Kyunghee and
Konkuk universities hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police and
shouted demands for withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea under a defense treaty, witnesses said.
   They also demanded the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan
for alleged corruption involving his seven-year administration.
   Police reported no arrests or injuries in the two clashes, each
of which lasted more than one hour. Police used tear gas to keep
the students from marching into the streets and fighting was
confined to school gates, witnesses said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Radical students say the United States supported Chun in
militarily putting down the Kwangju revolt in 1980, the worst in
modern South Korean history.
   In a separate incident, riot police moved in on blind protesters
and arrested about 20 of their leaders Tuesday when the
demonstrators, shouting ``Don't take our jobs!'' tried to march in
the city's center.
   Police beat several demonstrators over the shoulders with fists
when they resisted arrest, witnesses said.
   Riot police with shields raised moved in front and alongside the
300 protesters after trying for more than four hours to persuade
rally leaders to leave the middle of a 10-lane boulevard which runs
through downtown Seoul. Most of the protesters were blind or
visually impaired and carried walking canes.
   A spokesman said the protesters wanted the Ministry of Health
and Social Affairs to protect the jobs of masseur and masseuse,
traditionally held by the blind in South Korea but now going to
oriental herb doctors and sighted practitioners.
   The 8th International Paralympic Games for the disabled
currently are being held in Seoul and organizers said they timed
the demonstration to call attention to the blind workers' plight.
   The spokesman spoke on the condition of not being identified, as
did the witnesses.

<DATELINE>PALO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filipinos hurriedly reconstructed a
dynamite-blasted statue of Gen. Douglas MacArthur and pronounced it
ready on Tuesday for an anniversary ceremony this week.
   The rebuilt concrete figure has MacArthur's left shoulder larger
than the right, making it look like it's about to tip over. Missing
is the imperial air given the late American four-star general by
the original sculpture.
   But this coastal village on Leyte island wanted to have the
10-foot-high statue back up in time for a ceremony Thursday marking
the day when MacArthur led U.S. troops in liberating the
Philippines from Japan on Oct. 20, 1944. World War II veterans
already have begun arriving here.
   Four days earlier, vandals blasted apart the statue, which shows
MacArthur, flanked by Filipinos and American soldiers, wading
ashore on Leyte.
   Police suspect despoilers under the influence of alcohol or
drugs may have been responsible, but do not rule out communist
rebels as suspects.
   Laborers reinforced the statue's steel frame to minimize damage
in case of a second attack.
   Dozens of former Japanese soldiers visited the site Tuesday,
about 300 miles southeast of Manila. Most of them posed for
photographs in front of MacArthur's statue.
   Among the Americans in Palo was Dr. Alfredo Mescallado, 75, of
New York City, a naturalized American of Filipino descent who
served as a physician under MacArthur during the war.
   ``I think (the vandalism was) immoral,'' said Mescallado.
``Maybe (the vandals) didn't know that MacArthur liberated the
Philippines ... They don't know their history.''

<HEAD>Senate Affirms Support For Contras, Passes Montana Wilderness Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, warning that it might attempt to
renew military aid to Nicaraguan rebel forces at a future date,
voiced its moral support for the Contras on Tuesday and also
formally embraced Chile's movement toward democracy.
   The non-binding ``sense of the Senate'' proposals were attached
as amendments to an unrelated bill which designates 1.43 million
acres of Forest Service land in Montana as wilderness.
   Another amendment called upon U.S. allies to turn back efforts
of the Soviet Union to obtain millions of dollars worth of loans.
   The bill was approved by the Senate, but it faces an uncertain
future. It must still be approved by the House, and that chamber
may not finish work on it before the 100th Congress adjourns.
   The Contra amendment, endorsed on a 54-12 vote, supports
unspecified ``continuing efforts to strengthen the internal
democratic opposition and the independent media of Nicaragua.''
   It also calls for ``maintaining the Nicaraguan freedom fighters
as one of the few `pressure points' on the Sandinistas by providing
the resistance urgently needed humanitarian assistance.''
   The proposal was offered by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who said,
``we need to send a message, not only to the resistance in
Nicaragua, but to people throughout the world.''
   White House officials and GOP lawmakers have said prospects are
nil for obtaining a $16.5 million cache of weapons for the rebels
in the waning days of the 100th Congress.
   The dwindling Contra forces are subsisting on $27 million in
food, clothing and medical supplies approved by Congress last month
as part of a Pentagon money bill. They have received no weaponry
from the United States since February, when lethal aid was
suspended.
   The mood in Congress remains strongly opposed to sending new
military aid. But Congress has approved a complicated process
permitting President Reagan to request the release of the $16.5
million in weapons, if certain conditions were met.
   Reagan said last week he might call the Congress into special
session to vote for the aid, should the Sandinistas strike hard
against the Contra guerrillas before the new Congress convenes next
January.
   The plan approved Tuesday endorsed that view. It warns that
Nicaraguan failure to comply with Central American peace accords
``will inevitably cause the Congress to approve additional military
assistance for the Nicaraguan resistance.''
   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Wyo., complained about the amendment.
``Anybody can send a message ... What I think we ought to send is
military support. I don't think we ought to kid ourselves, this
resolution isn't much.''
   The Chilean proposal was sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
and was added to the Contra measure on a voice vote.
   He noted the Oct. 5 vote to reject a new presidetial term for
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the military leader who has ruled the nation
since a 1973 coup overthrew the socialist civilian president,
Salvador Allende.
   ``We've have a long night of despair in Chile, from the coup in
1973 to until this year,'' said Harkin. ``It's incumbent on us to
support the Chilean people, to support this election they had, to
say that we are going to work with them in this restoration of full
democracy.''
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., complained that the proposal was ``a
feel-good amendment'' and said Pinochet had saved Chile from going
communist.
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho sponsored the Soviet loan amendment,
which was approved 64-2.
   The Soviets are trying to secure loans of U.S. dollars through
third nations, Symms said. ``The Soviets are using the eagerness of
the western allies to play one nation off against another, to get
them to compete with each other for the opportunity to donate hard
currency to finance socialist economic failures and Soviet foreign
policy,'' he said.
   The wildneress bill affects more than 6 million acres of Montana
and is the result of a compromise worked out among competiting
interests, including conservationists and the timber and lumber
industries.
   The bill designates about 1.43 million acres of Forest Service
land as wilderness, 360,000 acres as special management areas, and
another 20,000 acres as federal study areas. It also releases for
non-wildnerness uses more than 10 million acres in Montana's 10
national forests.

<HEAD>Iraq Offers POW Exchange `Unrelated' To Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has agreed to send home all Iranian
prisoners of war if Iran reciprocates, and an Iranian diplomat said
Tuesday he saw no reason why the exchange could not proceed.
   But Iraq said the POW exchange would be unrelated to other
issues in the U.N.-sponsored peace talks between the Persian Gulf
neighbors that went to war in September 1980.
   An Iraqi diplomat said his government's proposal would apply to
all prisoners of war if Iran accepts the plan.
   An Iranian envoy noted both nations had exchanged sick and
wounded POWs previously on a humanitarian basis, and said similar
repatriation could begin for the remaining prisoners.
   Both diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity.
   According to the Red Cross, which has sought the exchange, Iran
has 50,182 POWs and Iraq 19,284.
   But U.N. officials and Iraqi and Iranian diplomats place the
figures much higher, with many of the prisoners not registered.
They estimate Iran is holding from 60,000-70,000 POWs and Iraq
30,000-50,000.
   Ismat Kittani, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said in
a letter given Monday to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
that Iraq is ready to begin the POW exchange.
   But he added: ``Since the exchange of prisoners is a
humanitarian matter ... our agreement on this step is unrelated to
the other issues referred to'' in the U.N. agenda for peace talks.
   Security Council Resolution 598 called for an immediate
cease-fire, withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized
boundries and an exchange of prisoners.
   If the exchange occurs, it could help end a deadlock in the
peace talks that have not gone beyond acceptance of the cease-fire
that began Aug. 20 and the opening of negotiations five days later.
   A senior U.N. official close to the discussions told The
Associated Press that although Iraq said the exchange would be
unrelated to the talks, the offer represented an advance in Iraq's
position.
   A major issue is the dispute over control of the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway that forms the southern border between the two countries.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, Deputy Foreign Minister Nizzar Hamdoun said
Iran was setting unacceptable conditions by insisting that both
countries follow a 1975 treaty that placed the border down the
middle of the Shatt-al-Arab.
   Iraq wants the border to be drawnl along the Iranian shorline
and has said the treaty is not valid.
   ``The Iranian position ... is an attempt to pressure Iraq to
relinquish its political and legal rights while the two sides are
discussing purely technical issues,'' Hamdoun said.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali-Akbar Velayati, said Monday that
Iran agreed to a U.N. peace plan but with the condition that the
1975 treaty is upheld.
   Negotiations are to resume next week in Geneva.

<DATELINE>GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Hungarian-born brothers were
sentenced Tuesday to 18 months in prison after they were convicted
of relaying NATO military secrets to Hungary.
   Sandor Kercsik, 48, and Imre Kercsik, 34, both naturalized
Swedes, were arrested in August after authorities uncovered a spy
ring. Officials said the ring was headed by former U.S. Army
sergeant Clyde Lee Conrad in West Germany, which is a member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The prosecution said the Kercsik brothers acted as conduits for
information that Conrad sold to Hungary. Hungary belongs to the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance.
   During their trial at the Molndal District Court outside this
southwestern city, the Kercsiks said they came under pressure by
agents who constantly reminded them that they had a sister and an
ailing mother still in Hungary.
   They maintained that they were innocent of espionage, saying
they did not collect secret material but only relayed it. Their
lawyers also said the brothers' activities were not directed
against neutral Sweden and had been carried out in other countries.

<TEXT>
   A division of Litton Systems Inc. paid $1.95
million to resolve claims that the company inflated bids to supply
the government with military hardware, aircraft instrumentation and
radar equipment, the Justice Department said Tuesday.
   The civil settlement with Clifton Precision, Special Devices, of
Springfield, Pa., was reached following an audit cnducted and paid
for by Litton under a 1986 agreement with the government.
   The government alleged the company had failed to submit accurate
labor cost history when it bid on the contracts, despite Litton's
certification that it had done so. The government says it overpaid
labor costs during a nine-year period in connection with the
contracts.
   Litton was indicted and pleaded guilty in 1986 to defrauding the
government in bidding the material costs on the contracts. Litton
paid $11.9 million to settle the material issues and agreed to pay
double damages and interest on other claims, after losses were
determined. The new agreement addresses that determination.

<TEXT>
   Sudan's dusty paths became trails of
death where an an estimated 260,000 refugees, mostly children,
starved or died in the gunfire of a civil war this year, Western
relief officials said Tuesday.
   Among the victims were 180,000 children fleeing the war with
their parents, and about 95,000 could have been saved by simple
medical help such as vaccination, said Cole Dodge, Khartoum
representative of the United Nations child-welfare organization
UNICEF.
   The relief officials said most of the quarter-million people
died during long treks northward toward Khartoum or eastward into
Ethiopia in search of safety.
   The officials said the refugees, of whom one in five died,
suffered from lack of food or medical care after they left their
home villages.
   ``You have to notice that exceptionally large numbers of people,
affected by an accumulation of the effects of five years of war,
left their homes this year. Deaths in other years have been much
lower,'' said Dodge.
   Up to 2 million people have fled their homes in the southern
battle zone since the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, led by
U.S.-educated renegade army Col. John Garang, took up arms against
the government in 1983.
   The rebels, who are mostly Christian or animist Dinka tribesmen,
are fighting the government dominated by Arab-descended Moslems.
   Dodge said dimished farming and commerce in southern Sudan since
the war began have contributed to conditions that led to the high
number of deaths in 1988.
   ``The result is staggering: 260,000 estimated deaths. And that's
a conservative estimate,'' said one official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Haj Tayeb, acting commissioner of relief, said Western agencies
have exaggerated the casualties. However, he said the government
has no estimates on the numbers of civilians who died or were made
homeless in the war.
   An army spokesman, who requested anonymity, said there also were
no official estimates of government or rebel battlefield casualties.
   Western relief figures show that in 1988, 700,000 southerners
walked to the northern capital of Khartoum, 150,000 to the southern
town of Juba, 300,000 to Ethiopia and 150,000 to the regions of
Kordofan and Darfur in western Sudan.
   Bryan Wannop, representative of the U.N. Development Program,
said relief organizations must distribute the food cautiously so
that it doesn't fall into the hands of the rebels.
   The government in Khartoum has accused some agencies of
supporting the guerrillas and has expelled several organizations.
   The guerrillas say they control more than 90 percent of the
southern countryside, but the government says it controls the main
towns. The towns are restricted to most Western relief agencies,
making it difficult to assess conditions there.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development announced last
week it was beginning a $1 million airlift to Abyei, a refugee town
of about 35,000 just north of the war zone. An estimated 3,000
residents starved or died of diseases during the summer. Up to
10,000 people were estimated to have died in the southern Kordofan
area near Abyei.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the U.S. agency
also was trying to charter aircraft for a relief mission to the
rebel-besieged town of Aweil in the heart of the war zone. An
estimated 6,000 civilians and an undetermined number of troops were
reported stranded there with almost no food or supplies.
   But the sources said the American agency was having trouble
chartering a plane, since insurance rates have soared because of
rebel threats to shoot down relief planes. Another problem was
obtaining military approval for the flights, the sources said.
   A military spokesman who asked not to be identified charged that
some non-governmental Western relief organizations provide aid
mainly to the rebels.
   A Sudan Airways Boeing 707 was shot at on takeoff from Juba
airport Monday in southern Sudan and one engine was hit, but the
plane flew back to Khartoum on three engines and landed safely,
informed sources said.
   The sources, speaking in Khartoum on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday they did not know who did the shooting or how many
people were on the plane, which mainly carries relief supplies to
Juba, capital of the Equatoria region.

   The government announced Tuesday that
talks with the opposition have been delayed until after Oct. 24,
and urged its partners in the dialogue to disavow ``extreme
elements'' before the talks begin.
   The outlawed Solidarity labor federation replied it was ready to
begin talks immediately and blamed the government for the delay.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban strongly criticized
anti-communist banners and slogans during a street protest in
Gdansk on Sunday and asked participants in the discussions to
disassociate themselves from the protesters.
   Urban denied that the government was losing its will to enter
the talks or putting new conditions on the discussions, which are
to cover such questions as relegalizing Solidarity and economic and
political pluralism.
   ``There are justified fears that not all the partners of the
round table are being led by the same intention,'' he said.
   Urban said talks originally due to start Monday were delayed
because church representatives who will take part won't return from
Rome until Oct. 24 and because of remaining disagreements over who
will participate.
   ``It's difficult to talk with those who are shouting that they
want to hang communists,'' said Urban.
   ``In this situation, the constructive, pro-reformatory
opposition has to make its decision. Either it will be willing to
seek agreement, against the extreme wing, or it will get linked
with the extreme elements.''
   Solidarity denied any extremism on its side.
   ``Solidarity, by the fact that it seeks relegalization,
obviously is ready to act as a legal union which accepts the
constitution, and all the people participating in these talks will
share the same view,'' Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz
said.
   Onyszkiewicz said the opposition has been ready since Monday to
begin. He said further delay could raise questions about the
government's desire for dialogue and prolongs an ``atmosphere of
hopelessness'' that he said led to the Gdansk episode.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak originally agreed to the talks on Aug. 31.
   Walesa then brought a halt to nationwide strikes that were
Poland's worst labor unrest since 1981.
   While refusing to give a likely date for convening the round
table, Urban said officials would like discussions to begin between
Oct. 24 and the Nov. 2 visit to Poland by Britain's Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   He said the atmosphere for the talks was made worse by the
Sunday march by about 700 youths in the Baltic port city of Gdansk
that ended with youths throwing rocks at riot police. Official
state publications and television gave heavy coverage to the
incident.
   The state-run PAP news agency said a prosecutor was
investigating.
   Urban said that among slogans chanted were ``Communists will
hang on trees instead of leaves!'' and ``Better the coffin than the
commune!''
   ``I think that the organizers of this demonstration were
striving for torpedoing the agreement (for talks) and for
overturning the round table,'' he said.
   But Solidarity spokeswoman Barbara Madajska-Krasowska on Sunday
said Solidarity activists tried to persuade the demonstrators to
disperse. The youths left only after police with water cannon
arrived, she said.
   Urban said Tuesday that ``a problem'' remained with the proposed
participation of longtime Solidarity advisers Jacek Kuron and Adam
Michnik.
   ``Gen. Kiszczak's offer ... said that all who stand on the
ground of socialism and the constitutional order can sit at this
table,'' Urban said. ``It's difficult for Michnik and Kuron to fit
into this category.''
   The Roman Catholic Church expressed concern Tuesday night that
job guarantees given workers who ended strikes in August and
September were violated.
   The episcopate secretariat, representing Catholic bishops
nationwide, said it sent a letter Monday to Kiszczak reminding him
of the guarantees of personal and employment security for strikers.
   Coal miners in southern Silesia and steel workers in the
southeastern city of Stalowa Wola complained that strikers lost
their jobs or suffered other reprisals, the secretariat reported.
   In another announcement, Urban said that Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski plans to visit the Soviet Union this week in
his first trip abroad as head of government. Urban did not give an
exact date.

   A bomb blasted the center of this
northwestern Pakistani village Tuesday and witnesses said seven
people were killed and 12 injured.
   Police put the toll at two killed and ``many'' injured.
   Details about the explosion were not immediately available and
no group claimed responsibility. Police have charged that agents of
the Afghan government secret service, Wad, are smuggling explosive
devices into Pakistan.
   Charsadda is several miles from the Afghan border.
   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some of the
seriously wounded were transferred to the provincial capital of
Peshawar about 12 miles to the northwest..
   Provincial police official Agha Saadat Ali told a news
conference in Peshawar on Tuesday police had recovered 14
foreign-made plastic explosive devices over the weekend.
   U.S.-backed Islamic guerrillas, based in Pakistan, have been
fighting the Marxist government in Afghanistan for 10 years.

   A 21-year-old man has been charged with
threatening Vice President George Bush's life by allegedly sending
a letter bragging that the writer could have shot the Republican
presidential candidate at a rally.
   The unsigned letter, which was sent to President Reagan from
Owensboro, included three photos of Bush taken as he spoke at the
rally here Sept. 27. The writer claimed to have been within 50
yards of Bush while carrying a concealed .45-caliber pistol.
   ``I could have easily pulled the pistol out and killed him where
he was,'' the writer said.
   David Allen Russell of Owensboro appeared Tuesday before U.S.
Magistrate Stewart Elliott on two counts _ threatening to take the
life of the vice president or inflict bodily harm on him, and
sending a threatening letter through the mail, according to U.S.
Attorney Joseph M. Whittle.
   He had been arrested Monday and was being held without bond at
Daviess County Jail pending another hearing Thursday before Elliott.
   Whittle said he would argue that Russell continue to be held
without bond ``because we believe he would be a threat to the
community.''
   Don Powers, assistant special agent in charge of the Secret
Service in Louisville, said Russell's arrest was ``based on
information that the agency received.'' He declined to elaborate,
and the Secret Service did not release any details about Russell.
   In their search for a suspect, Secret Service agents looked
through pictures and videotapes taken by high school students at
the rally, as well as photos and videotapes made by news
organizations.

   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen unleashed a snarling
attack Tuesday on the Republicans for running a campaign that has
turned the presidential election ``into a carnival sideshow of
nonsense and negativism.''
   ``We have witnessed, through the combined efforts of the
Republican party and their image makers and their nominees for
president and vice president, one of the most outrageous displays
of negative campaigning ever seen in the history of national
politics,'' Michael Dukakis' running made said in a speech before
more than a thousand students in a UCLA auditorium. They were
attending a forum on public service sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga.
   ``The idea of citizenship, in fact, the very idea of
self-government itself, is under attack,'' the Texas senator said.
``And there is no greater violation of that trust than to turn a
great national election into a carnival sideshow of nonsense and
negativism.''
   ``What has happened _ almost without notice _ is an utterly
vicious assault of distortion and character assassination''
directed at Dukakis, he said.
   ``They don't seem to mind what they say is untrue,'' he said.
``They don't seem to mind if it's misleading. They don't seem to
care that what they do is downright mean. If it sounds good, say
it. If it sells, package it. If it looks good, nominate it.''
   Bentsen said the Democrats have at times been slow to respond to
the charges. ``But I don't think we ever imagined that George Bush
and the Republicans would be so willing to debase that precious
currency of our democracy.''
   The Democrats have ``taken a beating from the pundits and the
pollsters'' who have ``pointed to an open casket in the ground and
virtually invited us to jump in.'' But Bentsen, who had been
promisng a ``give-'em hell'' campaign for days, said, ``We've got
three weeks to go, there's a lot of work ahead, and there's no time
for mourning because we intend to win.''
   Bentsen ridiculed Bush's statement that he believed in public
service, saying the Republican White House philosophy preaches
contempt for government and ``get while the getting's good.''
   ``They don't believe in much of anything at all when it comes to
public service because they have nothing but disdain for the role
government can play in the life of this nation,'' he said.
   ``They don't understand the need for strong, ethical boundaries
between public service and private gain,'' he said.
   Following the UCLA forum, Bentsen visited a McDonnell Douglas
aerospace plant in nearby Huntington Beach with Nunn, the
conservative chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Nunn
blasted the Republican assertion that the Democrats would cut
defense, recalling former Louisiana Gov. Earl Long's remark that to
tell when the opposition was lying, watch for when they ``move
their lips.''
   And then Bentsen emerged from a mock-up of a space station to
deliver a stump speech on defense and the space program.
   Bentsen was traveling next to a rally in San Jose, completing a
sweep of the three biggest California media markets in one day.
   Tuesday morning, Bentsen told local elected officials meeting in
San Diego that Democrats would pursue a much needed change in the
nation's trade and economic relations with its allies.
   ``We're not going to become hewers of wood and carriers of water
for the rest of the world. That's not our idea of America's
future,'' Bentsen told the League of California Cities convention.
   Bentsen said the Republican administration has failed to promote
U.S. trade, and has led the nation further and further into debt to
foreign countries.
   ``Many years ago, the famous pitcher, Satchel Paige, coined the
phrase: `Don't look back _ somebody might be gaining on you,' '' he
said. The need, he said, was for America to ``work harder and
smarter than the competition.''
   Dukakis, he said, had proven ``an ability to attract and sustain
high technology industries.''
   Bentsen said the United States must continue its role in
protecting its allies militarily. But, he said, it was time for
Japan and Europe to start paying their fair share of the cost.

   Communist Party factions argued
Tuesday about ethnic and social strife straining the fragile
Yugoslav union but the Central Committee ajourned for the night
without making any major announcements.
   The session ended without a vote on personnel changes. The
Tanjug news agency said the meeting would resume Wednesday morning.
   Early Wednesday editions of the official newspaper Borba said
many of the 200,000 Serbs in troubled Kosovo province were
dissatisfied with the ``fruitless and marathon discussions'' by
Central Committee members and planned a protest rally Thursday in
Pristina, the provincial capital.
   The committee is expected to make major personnel and policy
changes in efforts to quiet demands for dismissal of leaders blamed
in public protests for the nation's worst economic crisis since
World War II.
   Ten members of the 23-man ruling Politburo, including national
party chief Stipe Suvar, face a secret vote of confidence in the
162-member Central Committee.
   Four Politburo members are not involved in the vote because they
already have promised to resign. Nine are exempt because they hold
their seats as party leaders of the armed forces and of
Yugoslavia's six republics and two autonomous provinces.
   One of those exempt from the vote is Slobodan Milosevic, the
populist party leader of Serbia. His is the largest republic and
the two autonomous provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo, are part of it.
   His campaign for greater Serbian control over the provinces has
split the national party leadership, pitting him against
politicians who fear his standing with the people will rise at
their expense.
   Serbs have rallied by the hundreds of thousands in recent weeks
to express anger at alleged harassment of the Slavic minority by
the huge ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo region, the ancient
Serbian heartland adjacent to Albania.
   At a time of growing economic hardship, Milosevic has found
broad sympathy for his demand that sweeping leadership changes be
made.
   Inflation is running at an annual rate of 217 percent, causing
real wages to plummet, and the foreign debt currently stands at $21
billion. Austerity measures imposed in May have inspired strikes
and protests by workers, whose average monthly wage is the
equivalent of less than $100.
   Yugoslavia has not had strong leadership since President Josip
Broz Tito died in 1980.
   Each republic and autonomous province has its own government and
party structure. Tito put the decentralized system and collective
federal presidency in his 1974 constitution to prevent one republic
from gaining sway, but the result has been ineffective government
by compromise.
   Milosevic's activities have put him in open conflict with Suvar
and Milan Kucan, party chief in Slovenia, a liberal,
Western-oriented northern republic.
   Branko Greganovic, leader of Yugoslavia's official youth union,
indirectly attacked Milosevic on Tuesday.
   ``Those leaders who are putting themselves at the head of
discontented masses behave as if they were gifts from God,'' he
said. ``They behave as if they did not come to power with the
leaders they now attack mercilessly.''
   Raif Dizdarevic, current head of the nine-member collective
federal presidency, seemed to rebuke both Milosevic and Kucan in
backing Suvar's call for party unity.
   ``The lack of unity in the leadership, multiplying of late, is a
great danger for the country,'' he told the Central Committee.
   ``We need accord to unite in fighting problems, without imposing
some kind of hegemony over one another,'' said Dizdarevic, who
threatened nine days ago to impose ``emergency measures'' if unrest
continued. He did not specify the measures.
   In Parliament, a government plan to relax austerity measures for
workers in profitable firms and social services foundered because
deputies said proposed salary increases were too small.
   The International Monetary Fund, which insisted on the austerity
program introduced in May, was said to have approved easing the
rules for some workers.

<HEAD>Seven Teachers Arrested In Ohio Teachers Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARBERTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven striking elementary school teachers
were arrested Tuesday when they tried to block a van carrying
substitutes from entering the school.
   Second-grade teacher Mary Beth Foore said police arrested her
and six other women and put them in a police van after they draped
a 30-foot-long banner across a driveway to the Memorial Elementary
School in this Akron suburb in northeast Ohio.
   The banner said ``Kids Count _ Teachers On Strike For Class
Size.''
   The teachers were charged with disorderly conduct and released,
she said.
   The arrests came after the Barberton Teachers Association
rejected the school board's latest contract offer at a meeting
Sunday night. The association represents 285 teachers that struck
the 4,600-student system on Oct. 3.
   Lt. Ray Todd of the Barberton Police Department said the women
were arrested Tuesday morning after they refused to move away from
the front of the van. He identified the six other women as Carol
MacFarland, Jean Aleman, Maxie Muckleroy, Gloria Fickert, Paulette
Walker and Lynn Daverey.
   ``It was very scary, most of us have never had a parking or
traffic ticket before,'' Ms. Foore said. ``Elementary teachers are
normally very meek and very mild and very passive. I would do it
again. It's not the money, it's the class size.''
   Police said Ms. MacFarland and Ms. Foore were also arrested
Monday and charged with disorderly conduct after they tried to
block a van carrying substitute teachers to the same school.
   Ms. Foore said those arrested are scheduled to appear in
Barberton Municipal Court on misdemeanor charges Oct. 24.
   Superintendent Ron Clemmer said the board has offered pay raises
of 4.9 percent, 4 percent and 4.5 percent over three years.
   Violet Berlin, president of the association, said the teachers
want a two-year contract with 5 percent raises, improved health
benefits and class size limited to a maximum of 30 students.

   The five Central American
presidents have canceled their November summit meeting, Foreign
Minister Ricardo Acevedo said Tuesday.
   Acevedo gave as the reason _ ``We don't have a concrete agenda
or any positive points to offer our people.''
   The meeting may be rescheduled for early December in El
Salvador, he said.
   ``We don't want a presidents' meeting that is an international
political propaganda act, which would be counterproductive in the
long run,'' Acevedo told reporters.
   The presidents of Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and
El Salvador had agreed to meet to discuss reviving the regional
peace plan they signed on Aug. 7, 1987.
   The plan was aimed at ending civil wars in Guatemala, Nicaragua
and El Salvador. A fragile truce is in place in Nicaragua but
conflicts continue unabated in Guatemala and El Salvador.

   Federal regulators announced approval Tuesday
of an experimental plan for coordinated trading halts _ or circuit
breakers _ in stock and futures markets during steep price dives.
   The plan, proposed by the New York Stock Exchange and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, provides for a one-hour trading halt
across markets when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
plunges by 250 points or more from the previous day's closing.
   It calls for a two-hour halt when the Dow falls by 400 points.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the
stock markets, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which
oversees futures exchanges, approved the one-year experiment on the
eve of the first anniversary of the Oct. 19, 1987 stock crash.
   The New York Stock Exchange is the nation's largest stock market
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is the largest market for
trading stock index futures.
   Other markets, including the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities
Dealers' over-the-counter system, are joining in the plan.
   Government approval is effective immediately. It is up to the
exchanges to decide when the circuit breaker plan begins.
   ``We're ready to implement this as soon as Thursday,'' said
Andrew Yemma, a spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ``We
think this is a very significant action to remedy what problems
there were in the market a year ago.''
   The New York Stock Exchange did not give a specific start time,
but said it would be ``very soon.''
   The plan is designed to provide an orderly halt to trading
before one market _ stock or futures _ breaks down, shifting all of
the trading to the remaining market. It also is intended to allow
time for buyers to step in and counter overwhelming sell orders.
   During the 1987 crash, the Dow plunged a record 508 points,
wiping out $500 billion in paper wealth in a single day.
   Another part of the program gives individual investors, as
opposed to pension and mutual funds, preference in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange when the Dow moves either up or down by 25
points. The rule applies to orders of 2,099 shares and smaller.
   After the crash, many individual investors complained that their
orders were shunted aside, in some cases for hours, while larger
buy and sell orders from institutional investors were executed.
   The market halt plan is one of the key recommendations offered
after the crash by a presidential task force headed by Nicholas
Brady, a New York investment banker who is now Treasury secretary.
   Brady did not offer a specific proposal, but said some sort of
``circuit breaker'' was needed to derail a crash.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers said earlier this
month that it was going along with the plan only reluctantly
because it did not want to be the only market left open when all
others were closed.
   But, NASD President Joseph R. Hardiman argued that a
pre-announced trigger for market halts could act as a ``magnet,''
pulling the market down faster. As the market approaches the
trading halt limit, it could be flooded with orders from traders
fearful they will be prevented from selling, he said.
   With the SEC approval, which is effective immediately, a
previous six-month experiment to curb computerized index arbitrage
ends. The earlier program had imposed a so-called 50-point collar
on the New York Stock Exchange. When the market moved by 50 points
or more, index arbitrage orders were not allowed through the NYSE's
automated trading system.
   Index arbitrage is a form of trading designed to take advantage
of momentary price discrepancies between the stocks and futures
markets. It involves the buying and selling of massive orders on
stocks and futures markets and was criticized for making last
year's crash more precipitous.
   However, the collar experiment ran counter to the Brady
commission's finding that stock and future markets were in effect
one market and that disconnecting them could be dangerous.
   A new rule taking the place of the collar is designed to provide
more orderly index arbitrage. When the Standard and Poors 500 index
falls by more than 12 points _ the equivalent of 96 points on the
Dow _ index arbitrage orders will be shunted into a side file of
the trading computer. If buy and sell orders can be matched, the
trades will go through. If not, trading in individual S&P 500
stocks could be halted.

   Republican George Bush said Tuesday that with
inspiration from Winston Churchill and Harry Truman he would
``campaign as an underdog'' until Election Day, despite polls
showing he has widened his lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``No votes can be taken for granted and I'm not taking any votes
for granted,'' Bush told an audience at Westminister College.
   Westminster was the scene of Churchill's famous 1946 speech
declaring that a postwar ``Iron Curtain'' of secrecy and
self-imposed isolation had surrounded the Soviet Union and the
communist Eastern bloc.
   ``Churchill was right,'' Bush said, although few Americans
wanted to hear his message at the time.
   Several dozen protesters demonstrated outside the hall where the
vice president spoke. One carried a sign reading, ``Bush Is No
Churchill,'' echoing Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen's assertion that Bush running mate Dan Quayle was ``no Jack
Kennedy.''
   Bush said ``a rusting curtain'' separates East and West today,
but that ``in Europe and other parts of the world, we have yet to
see the full promise of Soviet change turn into change itself.''
   If elected president, Bush said, he would remain wary of Soviet
intentions, even though the Kremlin leadership under Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is more enlightened than before.
   ``Now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the
Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Bush mentioned Churchill and President Truman, who came to
Fulton for the former prime minister's speech on March 5, 1946, in
connection with his own election campaign.
   Churchill had suffered many setbacks and rebounds from oblivion
during his long, tempestuous career in British politics, and Truman
scored a stunning upset when he defeated Thomas E. Dewey, the
heavily favored Republican candidate, in the 1948 presidential
election.
   ``Those two men offer a very personal lesson for me. They knew
the ups and downs of political life like few others. They knew that
political opinion polls can be very misleading. And they knew that
no vote could be taken for granted,'' Bush said.
   Paraphrasing baseball great Yogi Berra, the vice president said
both Churchill and Truman ``knew that no election was over until it
was really over.''
   ``There are undecided voters out there,'' Bush said. ``The race
is close in many states,'' including Missouri, he said.
   As he left his hotel for the Westminster speech, Bush was asked
how he could call himself an underdog when a new NBC News-Wall
Street Journal poll gave him a 17-point lead over Dukakis.
   ``We're not going to lighten up,'' he replied. ``We're going to
stay right down to the wire. ... If I find anybody letting up in my
campaign, they're history.''
   Asked how he could expect people to believe he was fighting like
an underdog, Bush replied, ``Watch my smile and watch me work.
Watch how fast we go and where we go. We're not letting up. The
worst thing to do would be to show a complacency I don't feel or an
overconfidence that I do not feel.''
   In his speech 42 years ago, Churchill said that ``from Stettin
in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has
descended across the continent.''
   Bush said: ``We and our allies did not prevent the Iron Curtain
from shutting out the light to the East. But we did secure peace
and freedom for the West.''
   He said his campaign theme of ``peace through strength'' was
modeled after Churchill's world view.
   On an otherwise light campaign day, Bush used his official Air
Force Two jet plane as a backdrop in taping a campaign film, and
attended a rally attended by more than 3,000 people at Missouri
State University in Springfield.
   ``I have a feeling it's going to be tough for the liberals next
month,'' Bush said to the wildly cheering crowd.
   Bush aides said a new campaign commercial ridiculing Dukakis'
ride in an Army battle tank began airing Tuesday in several areas
around the country.
   ``This is no time to train somebody in how to meet with the
Russians,'' says the ad, which uses news footage of a helmeted
Dukakis standing in the turret of an M-1 tank.
   The Bush campaign is expected to intensify its TV commercials
dramatically in the final three weeks of the contest. Aides said
the vice president would hammer away at proven campaign themes such
as U.S.-Soviet relations, space and defense.
   Bush planned to make a campaign swing Wednesday through
Michigan, which Dukakis toured all day Tuesday, before he returns
to Washington for the first time in eight days.

<HEAD>Argentina Offers Talks Without Preconditions On Falklands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo said
Tuesday his government is ready to talk to Britain about the
Falkland Islands without preconditions, dropping its insistence
that sovereignty must be on any agenda.
   Caputo told Independent Television's Channel 4 in a broadcast
interview pre-recorded in Argentina that he believes the time is
right to start a dialogue between Argentina and Britain.
   The two countries have had no diplomatic relations since the
74-day Falklands War in 1982, won by Britain.
   ``I think there is a little light at the end of the tunnel,''
Caputo said. ``I think that we have enough common history, both
countries, and if we start a dialogue _ without preconditions _
just the dialogue, this is going to be very important.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has repeatedly
stated its willingness to talk with Argentina on ways to mend
relations, but has refused to discuss Falklands sovereignty with
Buenos Aires.
   A July 1984 meeting between British and Argentine government
officials at Bern, Switzerland, broke down over Argentine
insistence that Falklands sovereignty should be on the agenda.
   A Foreign Office statement Tuesday night reiterated Britain's
refusal to discuss sovereignty over the islands, which Britain has
ruled since 1833 and which Argentina claims as an inheritance from
the days of Spanish colonial rule. An Argentine invasion of the
islands touched off the Falklands War.
   ``The British government is determined to seek more normal
relations with Argentina and uphold its commitment to the Falkland
islanders,'' the Foreign Office said, referring to the 1,900 mostly
British-descended residents who have repeatedly stated their desire
to remain British.
   ``Sovereignty is not for discussion,'' the Foreign Office said.
   ``If Argentina genuinely wishes to improve relations with
Britain, she could do so by responding to the large number of
British proposals already on President (Raul) Alfonsin's table.''
   Britain and Argentina have held indirect talks through the
United States on some issues. Britain has said it wants to discuss
trade, air links and fishing with Argentina.
   Caputo, currently president of the United Nations General
Assembly, was asked if he meant Argentina would be prepared for
talks without discussing sovereignty.
   ``I'm saying without preconditions,'' he replied. ``This is a
very precise formula, without preconditions. No preconditions from
our side, no preconditions from their side.''
   Caputo said he hopes the talks will be held before Alfonsin
leaves office in December 1989.
   In an accompanying report on next May's presidential election,
Channel 4 asked Carlos Saul Menem about Caputo's proposal for talks
without preconditions. Menem, the opposition Peronist Party
candidate, is leading Eduardo Cesar Angeloz of Alfonsin's Radical
Civil Union in the polls.
   ``Sovereignty has got to be on the table,'' Menem said.
``Otherwise, there's no point in talking. I don't have any problem
negotiating with Mrs. Thatcher as long as she knows that the
islands' sovereignty is ours.''

   A 15-minute piece of music that the arranger said
was reconstructed from Beethoven's last work was warmly applauded
at its premiere Tuesday night but an occasional discordant note
came later from the audience.
   The work, presented at London's Royal Festival Hall, is
described as the first movement of what would have been Ludwig van
Beethoven's 10th symphony.
   Barry Cooper, a researcher at Aberdeen University, said he spent
five years piecing together symphonic fragments found in Berlin,
Bonn and Vienna after the German composer's death 161 years ago.
   ``The sketches struck me as being particularly good, even by
Beethoven's standards,'' Cooper told reporters Tuesday as the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra rehearsed for the premiere.
   ``Even though my completion won't be as good as Beethoven, I
think the overall result has got enough really good Beethoven in it
to make it very well worth hearing.''
   Violinist Sir Yehudi Menuhin, who conducted the second half of
the concert but not the movement, said: ``I think it is a valuable
work. It is certainly Beethoven.''
   Some purists disagreed.
   ``Calling this Beethoven's 10h was a bad idea,'' said John
Dankworth, a classically trained jazz composer. ``It should be
named `Excerpts and Snippets.'''
   Martin Woolf, who described himself as a music lover, said, ``I
thought it was marvelous fun, though I doubt Beethoven would have
followed the Ninth with anything like that.''
   Cooper, who wrote a book on Beethoven's creative process while
working on the musical reconstruction, said Beethoven's plans to
finish the final symphony were mentioned in a letter written eight
days before his death in 1827.
   ``He actually offered it to the Royal Philharmonic Society'' of
Britain, Cooper said, ``And now they've got it, or as much as there
is of it.''
   Speaking as a white bust of Beethoven solemnly peered over the
rehearsing musicians, Cooper called his work ``a chance for other
people to get some idea of what Beethoven had in mind. Knowing what
the 10th symphony is like has increased our knowledge.''
   The music ranges from whispery quiet sections to bold, soaring
themes over its 15 minutes.
   Menuhin, after hearing the music for the first time at the
rehearsal, said it was ``a very beautiful work.''
   The 71-year-old musician called the controversy over the
premiere ``rather silly.''
   ``Everyone is eaten with curiosity,'' he said.
   Asked if the work was important, Menuhin said: ``They use the
word `important' for all kinds of sales of antiques and `important'
gold coins. I think it's at least as important as that.''
   Conductor Walter Weller called the piece ``very, very
interesting.''
   ``It sounds like a very young, powerful Beethoven,'' he said
after the practice session. ``Not the Beethoven you can hear in a
slow moment of the Ninth (Symphony), the Beethoven with one leg in
another world. This is a powerful one.''
   However, Weller said, he could tell which parts are the real
Beethoven, and where Cooper filled in the blanks.
   According to Cooper, two-thirds of the work was taken directly
from Beethoven's sketches, which sometimes were nothing more than a
single line of notes.
   ``There's something of Beethoven in every bar,'' he said. ``You
can't say Beethoven stops here and Cooper starts there. In
practically every bar, it's part Beethoven and part me.''
   Orchestra members were taking the Beethoven brouhaha in stride.
   First cellist Francis Bucknall said the movement ``is certainly
Beethoven. We haven't heard this piece of music before, so of
course it's important.''
   ``I don't think it's the best Beethoven we've ever heard,'' said
violist Andrea Creech, ``but obviously it is very exciting.''

   Eleven Soviet inspectors watched Tuesday as
U.S. military personnel using handheld power saws began the
historic destruction of Air Force cruise missiles under the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
   Led by Army Major Gen. Vladimir Medvedev, the Soviets arrived at
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base to watch 41 ground-launched cruise
missiles, 41 protective canisters for the mobile weapons and seven
transporter erector launchers be cut in half over the next few days.
   ``The INF treaty is one of the most critical steps in the
direction of ending the Cold War,'' Medvedev said after the
destruction started. ``What we saw today was a critical step in
that direction.''
   The Soviets, who flew from Travis Air Force Base near San
Francisco aboard an Air Force C-141 Starlifter, were met by a U.S.
delegation headed by Brig. Gen. Roland Lajoie, director of the
Defense Department's On-Site Inspection Agency.
   ``What we saw today should generate more confidence and
predictability in our relations,'' Lajoie told reporters after the
first missile was destroyed.
   The destruction started with several Air Force personnel cutting
into a missile and an aluminum canister with handheld power saws.
The missile was a 21-foot device built in 1986 by the
McDonnell-Douglas Astronautics Co., flight-tested at the Army's
Dougway Proving Ground in Utah and deployed at an Air Force station
in Sicily before being shipped to Davis-Monthan in February.
   Soviet inspectors and U.S. personnel sat on nearby bleachers as
they watched the work, which produced loud noise and acrid smells
as the saws cut through into metal. Fire extinguishers were
positioned near the workers.
   Also slated for destruction was a 56-foot, 78,000-pound launcher.
   Nuclear warheads, fuel and guidance-related equipment have been
removed from each weapon, and the warheads have been returned to
the Department of Energy, which stores American nuclear weapons,
said Capt. Kendell Pease, an OSIA spokesman.
   Soviet inspectors have made two previous visits to the United
States under the treaty, once in July and again in August. They are
being escorted during their stay by 22 officials from Davis-Monthan
and the OSIA.
   A total of 443 intermediate-range cruise missiles deployed in
Great Britain and Europe are scheduled for destruction, all within
the first three years of the treaty.
   Signed last December by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, the treaty also calls for elimination of 169
shorter-range Pershing I-A and 234 Pershing II intermediate-range
missiles that the Army has deployed in West Germany.
   The treaty requires elimination of all land-based nuclear
missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles. The cruise missiles
have a range of about 1,500 miles.
   The warheads are not included in the destruction process, which
Air Force Lt. Col. Donald Black said specifies lengthwise cuts
through the missiles and cutting the launchers in half.
   ``The treaty does not eliminate the warheads,'' Pease said. ``It
eliminates the ability to deliver the warheads.''
   He said implementation of the treaty is ``a confidence builder
on both sides, and an important first step.''
   Col. Robert Stone said destruction of the equipment should be
completed within about 72 hours.
   The inspectors were to wear protective eye gear and ear plugs
and would remain within the 600-by-300-foot fenced compound at the
Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center. The compound houses
missiles, canisters and launchers stockpiled for destruction.
   ``When you have four rescue saws going, it's worse than going to
the dentist,'' Stone said.
   Black said 58 Pershing missile stages were eliminated between
Sept. 8 and Friday at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant at
Karnack, Texas. The Army is destroying at least some of the
Pershings by burning their engines.
   The Pershings each have two stages, and their launchers will be
eliminated beginning this week in Germany, said Susan Franklin, a
spokeswoman for the On-Site Inspection Agency in Washington.
   As of Friday, the Soviet Union had eliminated 277 missiles under
the treaty, which specifies destruction of 1,846 missiles of
several types: SS-20, SS-23, SS-12, SSC-X-4, SS-4 and SS-5.
   The INF treaty is the first to allow on-site inspection and is
viewed as a trial for the proposed Stategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
That pact would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear
weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent and call for more intricate
verification procedures.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front spread over the Midwest and eastern parts of the
country Tuesday, bringing snow showers to Minnesota and high winds
to other areas.
   Areas in the central and southern Great Plains that had record
high temperatures in the 80s and 90s on Monday were only in the 50s
and 60s Tuesday.
   The first heavy snow of the season was reported at Hibbing,
Minn. Some accumulation was possible Tuesday afternoon in the
higher terrain.
   The cold front that is spreading the cooler air moved into New
York. Wind gusts between 30 to 50 mph were common from Buffalo,
N.Y., to Burlington, Vt.
   Rain showers continued to the east of the cold front and
extended south into the mid-Atlantic coastal states.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed in northeast Oklahoma and
brought pea-size hail and gusts to 40 mph in Muskogee. Showers and
thunderstorms continued in portions of Arkansas and extreme western
Tennessee. Patchy light rain was over Kansas and southwest Missouri.
   Light rain occurred throughout the morning in much of Washington.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included three-tenths of an inch at Charleston, W.Va., and a
quarter-inch at Quillayute, Wash.
   Skies were mostly sunny over the Rocky Mountains and
southwestern states.
   Afternoon temperatures were in the 40s and 50s in the Great
Lakes region and from the northern Rockies to the Pacific Northwest.
   Readings were in the 70s and 80s from southern Virginia and the
Carolinas across the gulf coastal states to the southern half of
Texas.
   Temperatures were in the 60s and 70s over the southern and
central Rockies and much of the intermountain West. Readings in the
desert Southwest and interior valleys of California were mostly in
the 70s and 80s, with a few 90s in the deserts.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Ely, Minn., to 92 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif. The
nation's low Tuesday morning was 15 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms across southern portions of the Gulf coastal states.
Widely scattered showers were forecast near the eastern Great Lakes
and western Pennsylvania.
   High temperatures were to be in the 80s across the Gulf Coast
region and southern Texas. Readings were to be in the 80s and 90s
over the desert Southwest and interior California.
   Temperatures were expected to be in the 40s and 50s from New
England across the Great Lakes region to eastern portions of the
Dakotas and Nebraska. Highs were to be in the 50s from northern
Montana to northern Washington state. Highs elsewhere across the
nation were to reach the 60s and 70s.

   Americans of low and moderate incomes are more
generous with their financial contributions and time than their
upper income counterparts, according to a Gallup poll released
Tuesday.
   ``Contrary to popular opinion, the well-to-do in America cannot
be described as generous,'' said Brian O'Connell, president of the
Independent Sector, a coalition of 650 corporate, foundation and
volunteer organizations that commissioned the survey by the Gallup
Organization.
   ``Giving and volunteering in America is a stark contrast between
heart warming generosity and bone chilling selfishness,'' he said,
noting the results of the in-home interviews conducted last March
with 2,775 Americans 18 years and older.
   O'Connell told a news conference that contributing households
with incomes below $10,000 gave an average of 2.8 percent of their
incomes to charity, while families between $10,000 and $30,000 gave
2.5 percent. Those with incomes between $50,000 and $75,000 gave
1.5 percent; families earning $75,000 to $100,000 donated 1.7
percent, and those with incomes over $100,000 gave 2.1 percent.
   Overall, the survey said seven out of 10 households in America
contributed an average of $790 to charitable organizations, with 45
percent volunteering an average of 4.7 hours a week in time to
causes and organizations in 1987. Independent Sector said the
margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   These figures translate into 80 million people giving a total of
19.5 billion hours with a dollar value of time contributed at $150
billion, O'Connell said.
   Eugene C. Dorsey, head of the group's ``Give Five'' campaign to
increase volunteerism, said the latest study showed it was possible
to reach the organization's goal of motivating Americans to donate
at least 5 percent of their incomes and five hours a week to the
causes of their choice.
   Dorsey, who also serves as president of the Gannett Foundation,
said ``the findings confirm the need for the `Give Five' campaign
to estabish a basic standard of what we owe to our communities.''
   Virginia A. Hodgkinson, the Independent Sector's vice president
for research, said the poll's finding that giving decreases as
income increases had been missed in previous Gallup surveys which
measured only the amount given without regard to what percentage of
income the donated amount represented.
   Hodgkinson said the results indicated that a typical generous
American household was a moderate income family of five living in
the rural Midwest that volunteers and belongs to a church. The
least generous profile was a single, affluent individual living in
a central city in the South who does not volunteer or attend
church, she said.
   These rankings were formulated by evaluating results of averages
for weekly volunteerism, income and the percentages of family
members who were volunteers, she said.
   Using this, the Midwest was first, with volunteers donating 2.5
hours of their time and 1.5 percent of their income, followed by
the West, 2.4 hours, 1.5 percent of income; the East, 2.0 hours,
1.2 percent of income; and the South, 1.8 hours, 1.7 percent of
income.
   Although those questioned in the South gave a greater percentage
of their earnings to charity, Hodgkinson said this group had a low
proportion of households with a volunteer and an overall lower
number of volunteers in the general population.
   Community rankings, using the same criteria, showed rural areas
volunteered 2.4 hours and contributed 1.8 percent of income;
followed by suburban, 2.2 hours, 1.5 of income; and central city,
2.0 hours, 1.3 percent income.
   Married people gave 2.5 hours a week and donated 1.5 percent of
their incomes, compared with singles who gave 2.0 hours a week and
only 0.5 percent of their incomes.
   Those with three or more children give 2.7 hours a week and
donated 2.0 percent of their income.
   The study also indicated the importance of religion in
volunteerism, with 79 percent of church members contributing funds
and 51 percent volunteering their time, compared with 55 percent of
non-church goers giving donations and 33 percent volunteering.

   The Mandalay Ruby, a royal red gem that weighs
48 carats, was supposed to sell for a record $15 million at auction
Tuesday.
   It didn't.
   Instead, a high bid of $7.6 million was rejected as insufficient
by the gem's owner, and the ruby _ which Sotheby's earlier called
the centerpiece of ``the most important jewelry sale ever held in
America'' _ was taken off the block.
   Meanwhile, Christie's auction house announced that the largest
diamond ever auctioned to the public would be offered at a sale
Wednesday.
   The 407.48-carat gem is second in size only to the 530.20-carat
Cullinan I, which is set in Britain's Imperial Sceptre as part of
the Crown Jewels.
   ``I'm certain this jewel will set a record price for a single
precious stone,'' said Francois Curiel, head of Christie's Jewelry
Department.
   He refused to estimate the price. The record auction price for
any jewel $9.31 million, the amount paid in April 19 for an
85.91-carat white diamond at Sotheby's.
   The diamond, currently owned by two New York jewelry dealers and
a jewelry retail chain in Dallas, was purchased as an uncut
890-carat stone in August 1984 but has since been cut into a
flawless stone.
   At Sotheby's auction house Tuesday, about 300 people strained
their necks to catch a glimpse of those who put up the
multimillion-dollar bids for the Mandalay Ruby. But the
auctioneer's gavel slammed down a short time later to end the
bidding without a sale.
   Jennifer Brown, a Sotheby's spokeswoman, said the identity of
the ruby's seller would not be revealed.
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed,'' said John D. Block, head of
Sotheby's jewelry department. ``This was expected to bring a record
and it didn't. It was such an enormous price we were trying to get.
On unique objects, it's very hard to put a price on it. Sometimes
it doesn't work.''
   The ruby was offered in the same session as the Star of Sierra
Leone Diamond No. 2, which was sold for $3.52 million Tuesday. The
diamond is one of 11 stones cut from a 969-carat diamond discovered
in the west African nation in 1972.
   Several Mandalay Ruby bidders, who asked not to be identified,
suggested that perhaps extensive pre-sale publicity about the ruby
had backfired on Sotheby's.
   In its pre-auction report, Sotheby's had given the Mandalay a
glowing review.
   ``The combination of pleasant shape and proportions, fine color,
transparency and luminosity, make it an exceptional gemstone,''
said a report released by the auction house.
   Block described the Mandalay Ruby as ``the largest faceted gem
known'' and estimated it would command about $15 million.
   The record price for a ruby is $1.9 million, paid at a Paris
auction in July for a 10.4-carat stone.
   The Mandalay Ruby is framed by 18 diamonds within a
gold-and-platinum broach mounting. Small, diamond-set fleur-de-lys
designs decorate the corners.
   The Mandalay Ruby, named after the Burmese city near which it
was mined, was brought to England in 1875. ``It is questionable if
the London market would ever have seen (the gem) but for the
necessities of the Burmese government,'' wrote Edwin W. Street, a
contemporary gem expert. ``In Burma, the sale ... created intense
excitement; a military escort was considered necessary to escort
the persons carrying the parcel to the vessel.''
   The gem was sold at Sotheby's in 1896. ``The buyer was reputed
to be an important Indian gem connoisseur acting on behalf of a
royal Indian family,'' according to a note by gem expert Benjamin
Zucker printed in the catalog for Tuesday's sale.

   The Senate on Tuesday voted to ban disposal of
sewage sludge in the Atlantic Ocean after 1991.
   The measure, passed by voice vote, would set a Dec. 31, 1991,
deadline for dumping in the Atlantic by nine authorities in New
York and New Jersey.
   The bill would impose stiff fines aimed at making the dumping
prohibitively expensive, and use penalty fees to pay for
alternatives.
   ``Today's action means that ocean dumpers have to find
alternatives to using the sea as the world's biggest garbage pail,
or face fines and penalties,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
a principal sponsor of the legislation.
   The measure reconciles differing sludge-dumping bills passed by
the Senate in August and by the House earlier this month.
   A House vote on the compromise could come as soon as Wednesday,
with President Reagan then expected to sign the bill.
   Some 8 million tons of sludge a year are dumped by the nine
agencies at a site about 106 miles east of New Jersey. Congress
closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987.
   The new bill would require dumpers to pay fees of $100 dollars
per ton of sludge beginning next Jan. 1.
   Dumpers, meanwhile, would be required to negotiate with federal
authorities on individual timetables for ending their dumping.
   Those agencies that cannot strike a deal would pay fees that
rise from $100 a ton to $200 a ton by the end of 1991. Any
authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by the start of 1992
would have to pay penalties in addition to the fees.
   Those fines would begin at $600 per ton and rise by 11 percent a
year for continuing violators, rising to total tens of millions of
dollars.
   Congress originally banned ocean sludge dumping as of 1981, but
that deadline was suspended in a successful lawsuit by New York.
The original deadline was set in a 1978 law, after which some 300
industries and 100 municipalities stopped dumping.
   The proposed ban initially was opposed by New York officials,
who complained that the deadline would be impossible to meet.
   But the opposition weakened as a bipartisan coalition of East
Coast lawmakers rallied in favor of a ban.

<HEAD>Despite Criticism, Israel Gains In Assembly Vote On Credentials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly on Tuesday voted to
accept Israel's credentials by the widest margin in the six years
since Arab states have been making demands to disqualify the Jewish
state.
   In an annual vote on membership in the 159-member world body,
Israel was accepted by a vote of 95 to 41 with seven abstentions
and 16 nations absent. That was 15 votes better than last year,
when the vote was 80-39 with 10 abstentions.
   For the past six years during the credentials vote, an Arab
nation has urged acceptance of all countries except Israel. Each
year a Nordic country has proposed the Arab amendment be rejected.
   Israel's acting ambassador, Johanan Bein, called the vote
Tuesday ``an impressive and very significant victory.
   ``In the six years in which we have had this annual ritual we
see from year to year a gradual improvement,'' he said.
   Israel has been condemned by many U.N. members for its harsh
measures in putting down the 10-month Palestinian uprising in
Israeli-occupied territories. Increasingly, however, the United
Nations and its members are calling for an international peace
conference on the Middle East involving Israel and all parties to
the dispute.
   Among the changes in voting this year were Hungary, which voted
``yes'' to accept Israel's credentials. Last year, Hungary was
absent.
   East Germany, which last year voted against Israel, this year
was absent, in a tentative signal of warming intentions.
   Other countries who switched from ``no'' votes or absences to
``yes'' votes were Sierra Leone, Suriname and Zambia.
   Two new ``no'' votes came from Jordan and Afghanistan, which
last year were absent. In July, Jordan severed its administrative
ties with the West Bank and distanced itself as a player in a
Middle East peace settlement.
   The Israeli Mission spokesman, Baruch Binah, attributed the
improved vote to an atmosphere of international reconciliation,
better East-West ties, greater pragmatism at the U.N. and the
increasing prestige of the world body.

   Opposition deputies on Tuesday urged the improvement
of equipment on Italian runways following the crash of a Uganda
Airlines jetliner while trying to land at Rome's main airport in
heavy fog.
   Thirty-one of 52 people aboard were killed in the disaster early
Monday, which occurred when the Boeing 707 swept in low from the
sea, struck two houses and trees and smashed into a field a few
hundred yards from a runway which lacked sophisticated landing
guidance equipment.
   Investigation of the crash revolved around a number of questions
raised by airport officials and pilots:
   _Did the pilot miscalculate the altitude or angle of descent?
   _Did the altimeter, the instrument that measures altitude, fail?
   _Did the pilot misunderstand instructions from air traffic
controllers or receive bad advice?
   _Did a bank of fog suddenly roll across the runway, robbing the
pilot's vision?
   Uganda's transport minister arrived in Rome Tuesday to join an
investigation led by the Italian Transport Ministry. A separate
investigation will be conducted by Italian magistrates.
   Crucial to the probe will be tapes of cockpit-tower
conversations and an examination of the ``black box'' instrument
recordings found by rescuers.
   Stefano Rusconi, who directs the technical division of the
Italian pilots' union, said on state television that other airlines
had decided to divert flights late Sunday night from the fog-bound
Leonardo da Vinci airport.
   He also noted that the runway the Ugandan pilot was aiming for
is one of two runways at the airport without the Instrument Landing
System, which gives pilots information about their altitude. Four
of the main runways are equipped with the system.
   Three Communist Party parliamentary deputies appealed to the
transport and interior ministries for ``immediate administrative
measures'' to ensure that all runways in Italy have the landing
guidance euipment.
   Rusconi said Italian pilots have complained frequently about
Italian airports that don't have the most up-to-date devices.
   Hospitals treating survivors reported that at least two of the
21 injured victims were in serious condition. One was identified as
Victoria Komukyeya, described as a Ugandan princess from Toro, a
former kingdom in western Uganda.
   Among those reported in good condition was 8-month-old Richard
Gait and his parents, Geoffrey and Ruth, of Bath, England, who
escaped from the burning plane with minor injuries.
   The British Embassy in Rome identified two Britons among the
dead as Manjeet Dhillon, who also held Nigerian citizenship, and
Kara Ibrahim Noor Mohamed, a native of Bolton, England. Their ages
were not available.
   Among the dead were six Ugandan members of the flight crew,
including the pilot and co-pilot.
   By late Tuesday, neither the airline nor Ugandan government
officials in Rome had released a list of the dead.

   The Supreme Court on Tuesday reduced the
sentence of former Foreign Minister Clodomiro Almeyda, allowing the
Socialist politician to be freed after 15 months' political
imprisonment.
   Opposition parties called for Almeyda's release last week,
saying it would represent a good-will gesture by President Augusto
Pinochet.
   Gen. Pinochet lost a plebiscite two weeks ago on extending his
rule to 1997, and the triumphant opposition is pressing for
democratic reforms it says are needed for a transition to elected
civilian rule.
   As Almeyda left Santiago prison to the applause and cheers of
about 100 supporters, he declared his ``decision to join the
struggle of the Chilean people to recover full democracy.''
   Almeyda, president of the United Left, a five-party alliance,
was sentenced to 541 days for violating internal security laws by
making anti-government statements. The court cut that sentence to
390 days, less than the time already served.
   Almeyda, 65, was foreign minister under Marxist President
Salvador Allende, whose elected government was toppled by Pinochet
in a 1973 military coup. He served briefly as acting president
during a trip abroad by Allende, who died in the takeover.
   Imprisoned after the coup and later expelled, Almeyda
disregarded an official ban on his return and re-entered Chile in
March 1987. He was quickly jailed and senteced to three months
internal exile in a small southern town.
   After that exile ended in June, a federal court convicted him of
``apology of violence,'' stemming from his verbal attacks on the
Pinochet government, and sentenced him to prison.
   Last December, he was politically banned for 10 years for
allegedly violating a constitutional article banning pro-Marxist
statements and propaganda.
   With Pinochet's plebiscite defeat, an open presidential election
is due to take place in December 1989.

<HEAD>Begin Fuel Loading At Nuclear Power Plant Amid Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fuel was loaded into Mexico's first nuclear
power plant Tuesday while congressmen argued about canceling the
project amid the shouts of nuclear foes in the Chamber of Deputies.
   ``Mexico has entered the nuclear age,'' the Federal Electricity
Commission announced Tuesday afternoon after the loading had
started.
   Commission spokesman Roberto Femat said between a third and a
fourth of 92 tons of enriched uranium was put into the first
reactor unit Tuesday. The second unit of the U.S.-designed Laguna
Verde plant on the Gulf of Mexico in Veracruz state is still under
construction.
   Femat said loading could be completed in two or three days.
   In Mexico City, 180 miles east of the plant, about 400 people
crowded the public gallery of the Chamber of Deputies and shouted
``Laguna Verde No!'' during a congressional debate on the project.
   Most opposition parties are against the nuclear program that has
been a favored project of ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party
(PRI) administrations for the past 20 years.
   The government calls the project proof of Mexico's technical
ability.
   Although the plant is U.S.-designed much of the construction has
been done by Mexican firms.
   The commission said the Laguna Verde reactor would not begin
commercial operation until it has operated ``at 100 percent
efficiency for 100 continuous hours.'' The government has said the
tests could take six months.
   There have been protests near the plant and in the cities of
Veracruz and Xalapa, the state capital, since the government
announced Friday that fuel loading would begin within 10-25 days.
   Many parents in Palma Sola, a town only five miles from the
plant, kept their children out of school to protest the decision,
the Mexico City newspaper Excelsior said Tuesday.
   Anti-nuclear groups have urged the government to reconsider its
decision and vowed to continue their protests.
   They claim the plant is obsolete and dangerous and question the
need for nuclear power in oil-rich Mexico.
   Gonzalo Martinez Corbala, a PRI congressman and president of the
Chamber of Deputies' Energy Commission, has accused the critics of
distorting the facts and spreading misinformation.
   He rejected the idea of a public referendum on nuclear power,
saying the public is not informed on the issue, according to the
government newspaper El Nacional.
   The Laguna Verde plant has been under construction since 1973.

   A Geneva judge said Tuesday he has ordered that
banking records on assets linked to ousted President Ferdinand
Marcos be released to Philippine authorities.
   But his decision is certain to be fought by Marcos' lawyers.
They have appealed every court ruling involving the assets of
Marcos, who left the Philippines in February 1986 during a
civilian-military uprising. He is now living in Hawaii.
   Geneva Investigating Magistrate Vladimir Stemberger told
reporters his order released the records on the accounts held in
Geneva-based banks by 12 corporate bodies and people including
Marcos and his wife, Imelda.
   Marcos' lawyers have 10 days to file appeals.
   The Geneva ruling did not apply to the assets, which remain
frozen, Stemberger said. He declined to say what amounts are
involved.
   Officials in the Philippines claim about $1 billion in
``ill-gotten wealth'' were channeled into Swiss bank accounts
during Marcos' 20-year rule. The assets are reported to be placed
in the cantons of Geneva, Fribourg and Zurich.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker said Tuesday he is
fighting for his life in his defense against a $52 million lawsuit
accusing him, his wife and a former aide of mismanaging the
ministry he left in disgrace.
   Bakker's work for the ministry, with its television programs and
Heritage USA religious theme park, was praised in court by a former
member of the PTL board, who said Bakker deserved his high salary
and every bonus he received.
   And the evangelist's former financial secretary testified that
he reimbursed the ministry for personal expenses that were paid for
out of PTL funds.
   During a lunch break at the trial in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Bakker said of the case, ``It may be business as usual for everyone
else, but this is my life I'm talking about.'' He called it
``literally a trial for my life.''
   In the first week of the trial, held last month, PTL's current
managers presented testimony and evidence that Bakker received
millions of dollars in bonuses and salaries.
   The ministry went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, seeking protection
from creditors while it reorganized, in June 1987, three months
after Bakker resigned in a sex-and-hush-money scandal.
   In testimony Tuesday, pastor Evelyn Spencer of The House of
Truth Church in Oakland, Calif., said that she and other PTL board
members consistently voted unanimously in favor of bonuses for
Bakker.
   ``If a bonus came up, I voted for it,'' said Ms. Spencer, who
was on the board from November 1985 to March 1987, when the board
resigned.
   According to IRS figures presented in court, Bakker received
$278,000 in salaries in the fiscal year ending in May 1987, plus an
additional $1,167,000 in bonuses in that year.
   Bakker was to testify Tuesday but that was postponed a day to
allow him time to review canceled checks and reimbursement vouchers
that were supplied to his attorneys Monday.
   Bakker said he was ``a touch angry'' that he was only now
receiving information he needs to defend himself, and hinted at
intentional sabotage. ``I think somebody calculated they would hold
all the materials until the middle of the trial,'' he said, though
he did not say who.
   And he predicted his research would satisfy at least 90 percent
of the IRS's concerns.
   Also testifying Tuesday was independent financial analyst James
Wilson, who said PTL's finances from 1978 to 1986 showed it to be a
healthy, growing ministry without financial problems.
   According to Wilson, the ministry's fixed assets grew at an
annual compound rate of 28 percent during that time while revenues
increased 19 percent.
   Under cross-examination by PTL attorney Tom White, Ms. Spencer
could not recall the precise salary of Bakker during her time on
the board.
   ``Everything you can get your hands on would be fair?'' Judge
Rufus Reynolds asked Ms. Spencer about Bakker's compensation. Ms.
Spencer denied that.
   Also testifying was Patricia Harrison, Bakker's former financial
secretary, who said her job was to keep his personal expenses
separate from the ministry's money. She said she routinely wrote
reimbursement checks to the ministry for Bakker's expenses.
   But she said former Bakker aide David Taggart, also a defendant,
frequently received cash advances for himself and Bakker for which
she never saw documentation. Taggart told her he kept that
documentation at home, she said.
   An IRS agent also testified he found cash advances to Bakker and
Taggart that apparently served no legitimate business purpose.

   A debt-ridden committee formed to promote
Oxford as home of the original Lone Ranger narrator on radio is
about to ride into the sunset without erecting a hoped-for statue
in a city park.
   The committee had sought to erect a statue of Brace Beemer, the
original Lone Ranger radio show narrator and the fourth voice of
the Lone Ranger in the 1940s, but fell far short of the $75,000
that would have been needed for the monument, committee members
said.
   At what's expected to be its final meeting Thursday, the group
will discuss how to dispose of its assets of about $3,000, said
Jacqueline Wassil. A $2,000 printing bill is still unpaid, she
said. The committee has already repaid $20,000 in debts, committee
members said.
   In its first year, the group spared no expense in its promotion
of the city, about 35 miles northwest of Detroit, as home of the
Lone Ranger. The committee sponsored a Super Week, held in
conjunction with the Super Bowl, which was played in Pontiac on
Jan. 24, 1982.
   ``We threw a three-day party like this town has never seen _ and
never will again,'' Wassil said. Events included a concert by
country music star Tammy Wynette that cost $10,000.
   In the years following Super Week, the Lone Ranger Committee
hosted other fund-raisers but none were successful, Wassil said.
   Robert L. Bunting, an attorney who hasn't given up on erecting a
Lone Ranger statue, said he won't miss the committee.
   ``I've never had much faith in committees. I think the Lone
Ranger would have ended up on a camel,'' Bunting said.
   Bunting said he believes private funding, particularly corporate
donations, could finance the statue.
   ``It's just going to take a while,'' Bunting said.

   The Senate granted election-year benefits to
one of the nation's largest interest groups Tuesday when it
approved bills elevating the Veterans Administration to a Cabinet
department and granting veterans the right to have courts review VA
denial of benefits.
   Both measures were approved on voice votes. The measure creating
the new Cabinet department now goes to President Reagan, who is
expected to sign it, while the judicial review plan must be
returned to the House for approval.
   The Senate also passed on a voice vote a bill granting a series
of cost-of-living increases in a variety of VA payments. The House
has yet to act on its version of that legislation.
   The Department of Veterans Affairs would be the 14th Cabinet
seat and the fifth created since 1960. The House passed the bill by
voice vote Oct. 6.
   Backers of the change said the Veterans Administration already
has the fifth-largest budget among federal agencies and giving it
Cabinet status will assure that the money is spent properly.
   The VA, with an annual budget of $30 billion, serves 27 million
veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors. It will pay out
about $14 billion this year in income maintenance and $626 million
for education and rehabilitation assistance in the current fiscal
year.
   The agency and its 240,000 employees administer about 90,000
patient beds in 534 health facilities and VA doctors will see about
20 million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries
and will bury 300,000 veterans in the next 12 months.
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, switching the VA
to a Cabinet department will cost $33 million over five years. Most
of that will be spent on changing signs on VA buildings.
   The second major piece of legislation gives veterans, for the
first time in 170 years, the right to ask federal courts to review
VA denials of benefits.
   The bill creates a new ``U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals,'' and
abolishes the current Board of Veterans' Appeals. That panel is
part of the VA and is now the last resort of veterans who are
unhappy with decisions to reject their claims.
   The measure also eliminates a Civil War-era law which limits
attorney's fees for veterans' claims to $10 per claim. That made it
difficult for veterans to hire lawyers other than those provided by
the VA.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee, called the measure a ``historic advance in
veterans' rights.''
   The House approved somewhat similar legislation on Oct. 3 by a
400-0 vote, but there were minor differences between that proposal
and the Senate package. The Senate bill will now be returned to the
House for another vote.
   The benefits increase legislation provides that 2.2 million
veterans with service-connected disabilities and 310,000 widows and
orphans will receive the same cost-of-living increases paid to
Social Security recipients.
   The House is expected to pass its own version, which would
provide a specific 4.1 percent increase, according to Cranston. The
Senate ``will undoubtedly concur'' with the House proposal, he
predicted.
   The Senate added an amendment which could provide interim health
care payments to some of the Vietnam veterans who were exposed to
Agent Orange, a highly toxic defoliant used by the United States in
Southeast Asia.
   The measure provides a ``presumption of service connection,''
under which the VA would assume that two types of cancer _
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma _ were caused by
Agent Orange. Veterans could receive benefits while the U.S.
government, which hasn't finally agreed that Agent Orange caused
cancers, studies the problem.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a Vietnam veteran, said Agent Orange
provisions will have ``a very limited effect.''
   ``I find it highly disturbing that those people who went to
fight the VC (Viet Cong) in Vietnam spend too much time fighting
the VA back here in this country,'' Kerry said.
   Before passage, the Senate approved, 47-15, an amendment to
permit the VA to offer Vietnam-era veterans flight training courses
under the auspices of the GI bill.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the sponsor, said airline deregulation
has created vacancies among pilots and there will be thousands of
pilot jobs to be filled in the next decade.
   But critics said the program was offered on a trial basis in
past years and hadn't worked.

   Republican George Bush held an 11-point lead over

Tuesday.
   ``The Bush-Quayle ticket drew support from 44 percent, to 33

   He said the poll was conducted by Teichner of California by
telephone over the weekend. Pollsters contacted 600 registered
voters in Colorado. The survey has a margin of error of plus or
minus four points.
   In the presidential race, 18 percent said they were undecided
and 5 percent expressed support for candidates other than Bush or
Dukakis.

<TEXT>
   Wildfires were slowed Tuesday by lower
temperatures and diminished winds after burning more than 7,300
acres and an exotic animal refuge and ancient Sequoia trees were
put out of immediate danger.
   The good news came after nearly 2,000 firefighters attacked two
big blazes with water-dropping helicopters and ground crews that
cut fire lines around the threatened animals and trees.
   The Divide fire in the Angeles National Forest 30 miles
northwest of Los Angeles had burned 4,110 acres by Tuesday but
stopped advancing toward the Wildlife Waystation, a shelter for
1,000 exotic animals that have been abandoned or wandered into
neighborhoods.
   ``It's still a long-range threat,'' cautioned Robert Brady, a
spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service.
   ``It looks like we have survived this one well. We've made it,''
said Martine Colett, owner of the shelter. ``My face is a picture
of wonderfulness.''
   The lions, tigers, giraffes, jaguars, horses, alligators and
other animals housed at the shelter became agitated as smoke and
ashes surrounded the area and airplanes buzzed overhead, but they
calmed down Tuesday as the fire slowed, she said.
   Ms. Colett praised the firefighters, who worked to clear an area
around the shelter and set a backfire to burn brush down the
mountain toward the fire, she said.
   The fire, started by a 10-year-old boy playing with matches,
burned in inaccessible mountain terrain and was 50 percent
contained Tuesday with full containment expected Wednesday evening.
Two of the 1,030 firefighters battling the blaze suffered minor
injuries.
   In the Sequoia National Forest 125 miles north of Los Angeles,
lower temperatures of 70 degrees and winds 3 to 10 mph aided
firefighters battling a 1,900-acre brushfire that threatened
2,700-year-old Sequoia trees in the 3-square-mile Giant Forest.
   Firefighters quickly extinguished a flare-up Tuesday morning
near the grove of trees which are considered the largest living
things on Earth.
   Although the trees were out of immediate danger, the threat
remained.
   The fire, which officials believe was started by a careless
camper or smoker, was 20 percent contained Tuesday but no estimate
was given on full containment. Four of the 930 firefighters on the
blaze suffered minor injuries.

   Right-wing Christian legislators
boycotted a voting session that was to elect a new speaker of
parliament Tuesday, and a lawmaker said his colleagues were
``dancing on the grave'' of Lebanon.
   The failure to elect a successor to Hussein Husseini, a Shiite
Moslem whose one-year term ended Sunday, sparked a new feud between
Christians and Moslems.
   In the absence of the 39-member quorum required to extend
Husseini's term or elect a new speaker, the 26 Moslem deputies who
showed up for the voting session declared Husseini a caretaker
speaker until a successor can be elected.
   The Christian deputies countered by issuing a statement
rejecting Husseini, a staunch ally of Syria, and naming their own
speaker pro tempore _ Kazem Khalil, 88, the eldest deputy among the
76 members of parliament.
   ``This is the fatal blow,'' said Khalil, a Western-oriented
Shiite who lives in Christian east Beirut. ``We're actually dancing
on the grave in which we have buried Lebanon.''
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since President Amin
Gemayel's six-year term ended Sept. 22 and no successor was elected
because parliament could not gather the necessary quorum.
   Two rival governments, one Moslem and one Christian, have since
emerged, splitting the army and security forces along religious
lines.
   Newly arrived U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy made his first visit
to the Foreign Ministry Tuesday, apparently to smooth tensions
after he was criticized by the ministry's director general, Farouk
Abil-Lamaa, for not presenting his credentials to the Christian
government of army commander Gen. Michel Aoun.
   ``I came to see the director-general to discuss basically the
general state of relations between Lebanon and the United States,''
McCarthy told reporters after the meeting at the building in east
Beirut.
   McCarthy took up his post Sept. 24, two days after the
expiration of Gemayel's term. He has been meeting almost daily with
Christian and Moslem leaders.
   McCarthy has declared he will present his credentials only to
the newly elected president, not to Aoun's Cabinet or the rival
government of incumbent Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a
Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem.
   When the Moslem deputies arrived for the 11 a.m. session at the
Parliament in Syrian-policed west Beirut, sniper fire crackled
overhead and some of the men were seen ducking for cover as they
approached the building in the devastated city center.
   Police said the bullets probably were fired by Christian
militiamen hiding in battle-scarred apartment buildings nearby.
   ``(The naming of Husseini as caretaker speaker) is essential to
preserve the integrity of the legislative authority, especially at
a time when the top executive post remains vacant,'' the Moslem
legislators said.
   The Christians justified their boycott of Tuesday's session by
declaring the area near Parliament unsafe. They demanded the
session be shifted to Villa Mansour, a two-story building near
Beirut's dividing Green Line that has served as temporary
headquarters for the Parliament since 1976.
   The Christians boycotted three previous Parliament sessions
called for Aug. 18, Sept. 22 and Sept. 23 to elect a successor to
Gemayel.
   Minutes before he bowed out 26 days ago, Gemayel, a Maronite
Catholic, named Aoun, then army commander and also a Maronite,
prime minister of a caretaker military Cabinet.
   But Moslems claimed Aoun's appointment violated an unwritten
national agreement dating to Lebanon's independence from France in
1943, under which the president has always been a Maronite, the
prime minister a Sunni and the speaker of Parliament a Shiite.
   The Moslems pledged allegiance to the incumbent Cabinet of Sunni
Moslem Prime Minister Salim Hoss.

Nebraska surveyed last week.
   Of the 783 registered voters surveyed last week, 52 percent said
they supported Bush and 32 percent said they supported Dukakis.
   By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, however, Nebraskans believe Democrat
Lloyd Bentsen is more qualified than Republican Dan Quayle to be

   Critics accused the foreign secretary
of deceiving his people for signing a new agreement o U.S. military
bases, but President Corazon Aquino said the pact enhances
Philippine-U.S. relations.
   The accord, signed Monday in Washington by Secretary of State
George Shultz and Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus,
allows the United States to use six military bases in the
Philippines until 1991.
   ``He has sold out his country and grossly deceived his people,''
the national Malaya daily said of Manglapus. ``For these treasonous
acts, he ought never to show his face again in Manila.''
   Critics said the accord could prompt even stronger opposition to
U.S.-run Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller
garrisons.
   ``The general perception is that the Philippines got the short
end of the deal, and this perception is expected to be exploited by
the anti-bases bloc to further fan the wave of anti-Americanism in
the country,'' wrote columnist Alvin Capino in Wednesday's issue of
the Philippine Daily Globe.
   Under the agreement, the U.S. government will pay the
Philippines $962 million a year for the use of the bases. The
Philippines had demanded $1.2 billion a year.
   ``We asked for 12 boxes of delicious apples, they gave us four
small bags of peanuts,'' said Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the
senate defense committee.
   He called the payment ``a publicly unacceptable compensation
package certainly strengthens the hand of those who are batting for
no extension after 1991.''
   Senators on Tuesday debated whether the pact required their
approval in accordance with a constitutional provision on
international agreements, but were unable to resolve the issue and
postponed discussion to a later date.
   ``I think many people, even those who are pro-bases, were
disappointed by the outcome so that would even help our cause,''
said Sen. Wigberto Tanada, a leading opponent of the bases and
principal sponsor of a senate bill banning the presence of nuclear
arms in the Philippines.
   The pact allows the United States to maintain its policy of
neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons in
aircraft and ships visiting the bases.
   Although U.S. policy was upheld, Mrs. Aquino said a
constitutional ban on nuclear weapons on Philippine territory ``is
being implemented,'' since the storage of such arms here requires
government consent.
   The Philippine constitution, approved in 1987, adopts a policy
of freedom from nuclear weapons ``consistent with the national
interest.'' Legal experts say the phrase falls short of an outright
ban.
   ``The agreement reaffirms the enduring bilateral relationship
between our respective countries and allows us to proceed to
improve other aspects in that relationship,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a
statement.
   Communist guerillas, whose demand for the removal of the bases
has fanned a 20-year-old rebellion, accused the goverment of
``shamelessly selling out'' Philippine sovereignty.
   ``We call on the Filipino people to reject this new agreement
and hold President Corazon Aquino accountable for this act of high
treason,'' the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines said in
a statement.
   The accord ends a nearly seven-month review of the 1947
agreement governing the U.S. bases in the Philippines, which are
the largest in the Pacific.

<HEAD>Alfonsin Sets May 14 Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin on
Tuesday called national elections for May 14 and hailed in advance
what he termed ``a singular accomplishment'' in Argentina _ the
peaceful handing over of political power.
   ``On Dec. 10, 1989, 61 years since the last time it happened, I
will hand over the sash and cane (Argentine symbols of office) to
the president who will succeed me in the honorable task of leading
Argentines on the unstoppable path to progress and greatness,''
Alfonsin said.
   In 1928, Hipolito Yrigoyen won national elections and replaced
President Marcelo T. de Alvear. Two years later Yrigoyen was
toppled by a military coup.
   Since Gen. Juan D. Peron completed his first term in 1952, no
Argentine president has finished the traditional six years in
office. A military coup ousted Peron in 1955 and the party that
carries his name was banned for the next 18 years.
   ``This is a victory for democracy,'' Alfonsin said in a
seven-minute speech taped at Government House and broadcast
nationwide at 9 p.m. ``We will complete the triumph of today in the
ballot boxes.''
   Interior Minister Enrique Nosiglia announced last month that
elections would be held in May. No exact date was set until
Alfonsin's speech.
   The two main political parties already have begun campaigning.
Eduardo Angeloz, the presidential candidate of Alfonsin's centrist
Radical Civic Union, began his campaign on Sept. 30 with a
multicity tour.
   Carlos Menem of the Peronist Party started his campaign Saturday
night.
   About 75,000 Peronists gathered Monday in the River Plate soccer
stadium to celebrate the anniversary of Peron's release from prison
in 1945 _ a pivotal event in Argentine history. Peron went on to
dominate Argentine politics for years.
   The third main candidate is Alvaro Alsogaray of the Union of the
Democratic Center.
   Both Menem and Angeloz are lawyers and provincial governors.
Alsogaray is an engineer, former economy minister and ex-ambassador
to the United States.
   Up for election are the presidency, vice presidency, many seats
in the House of Deputies, and thousands of provincial mayors and
local legislators.
   The main issue probably will be the economy. Gross national
production has been stagnant for eight years and inflation has
soared.
   The cost of living increased by 440 percent over the past 12
months. Public employees including doctors, railway engineers,
teachers and mail carriers hold frequent strikes to press demands
that wages keep pace with inflation.
   Polls indicate that Menem, who promises wage increases and tax
cuts, has a wide early lead over the more conservative Angeloz.
   The surveys gave Alsogaray virtually no chance of victory.
   Alfonsin's inauguration on Dec. 10, 1983, following elections
that October, ended nearly eight years of right-wing military
dictatorships.
   An attorney and human rights leader, Alfonsin has defended his
political record by stressing that whatever he did took place in a
democracy.
   ``In stable democracies, this occurrence (an election) is
routine,'' said Alfonsin on Tuesday, dressed in a dark suit and
seated at an ornate desk. ``In our country, which is subject to
shocks and disasters, it is a singular accomplishment.
   ``I have been an actor in a historic episode, but the authors,
those ultimately responsible, are each and every Argentine. None
should be indifferent to the jubilation ... and true national
celebration.''

   The stage is a medieval dungeon with furniture
and costumes that could have come from a seedy Greenwich Village
antique shop. Plexiglas panels separate the actors from the
audience, forcing the performers to wear body microphones so they
can be heard.
   One cast member, sporting a black beret festooned with tiny pink
roses, resembles a prancing Che Guevara masquerading as Isadora
Duncan. A second performer dresses in what looks like a nurse's
uniform _ only she's wearing patent leather shoes topped with
little black bows. A third actor wears red pajamas and a red
stocking cap. He's the hero of the piece, or at least the performer
with the most lines.
   It's hard to learn anything about these people in ``What Did He
See?'' _ Richard Foreman's latest exercise in avant-garde
incomprehensibility that opened Tuesday at off-Broadway's New York
Shakespeare Festival Public Theater.
   The three-character play lasts one hour. It seems like more,
especially if you attempt to decipher what the author is trying to
say. Foreman should know, since he wrote, directed and designed the
production. It's theatergoers who are left in the dark.
   In interviews, Foreman has described the play as being about the
dangers of retirement or the lure of idleness. You'll have to take
him at his word. The evening is mostly a series of independent
statements.
   For example, the pajama-clad hero announces, ``I have to tell
the truth. I no longer function as a normal human being.'' He's
right.
   The actors work hard at seeming to believe all they have to say.
Will Patton, best known as the villain in the film thriller ``No
Way Out,'' projects what appears to be an appropriate air of
desperation. Lili Taylor and Rocco Sisto are his mysterious
sidekicks, the people who alternately support or berate him,
depending on the whims of the playwright. Their dedication is
admirable.
   The title of the play asks ``What Did He See?'' It poses a murky
question that can only have one answer _ not very much.

   The Communist-led General Confederation of Labor,
France's largest union, launched its ``Day of Action'' Tuesday with
marches in all major cities and strikes that disruped public
services.
   The one-day walkout was to support demands for an increase in
the minimum monthly wage from $758 to $968. The confederation also
is asking for protection of purchasing power, more employment,
better working conditions and retirement protection.
   Tuesday's strike hit hardest public transportation, the postal
service and the state-run electricity company. But it is only a
foretaste of more widespread strikes scheduled for Thursday by the
other unions representing public employees.
   Michel Durafour, the civil service minister, has refused to
consider any new pay increases for 1988. Talks between the
government and the unions on 1989 salaries are to begin soon.
   Also joining the strike were employees at French diplomatic
posts around the world, where staff are fighting a series of cuts
in their cost-of-living allowments.
   It coincided with a nationwide strike by France's nurses and
hospital employees who demand higher wages. The nurses want $325 a
month more. The government has offered about $105, depending on
experience and seniority.
   President Francois Mitterrand, on a visit to Normandy, told a
group of nurses that they were asking ``much too much,'' saying the
government of Premier Michel Rocard already had ``given a lot.''
   The workers' demonstration in Paris turned out 100,000 people,
according to the union. Police estimated the crowd at 15,000 to
20,000. About 5,000 marched in Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseille, each
and smaller demonstrations were held in other cities.
   The Paris subway ran at about 50 percent to 70 percent of its
normal service Tuesday, while service was normal in Lyon and
Marseille. Long distrance rail lines were practically normal in
most parts of the country, except for the west, where a third of
the scheduled trains did not run.
   Hardest hit was the state-run electric company. Sporadic power
cuts hit nearly all areas. The postal service also was heavily
affected. Strikes in main sorting centers spelled delays of mail
for the next several days.

   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's proposal
for ending four decades of rivalry and conflict with North Korea is
being praised by a senior U.S. official as an ``imaginative and
constructive policy of reconciliation and accommodation.''
   The United States plans in a few days to announce changes in
American policy toward North Korea in a new effort to lower tension
on the Korean peninsula going back to the 1950-53 Korean War, the
official said Tuesday.
   U.S. policy toward North Korea is currently under review, in
consultation with South Korea, and changes probably will be
announced soon after Roh's talks with President Reagan at the White
House Thursday, the official added. The source briefed reporters on
Korean issues and the forthcoming Reagan-Roh meeting on condition
he not be identified.
   ``Dramatic change'' should not be expected in U.S. policy toward
North Korea because ``after all, we're talking about a state which
we have officially characterized as terrorist,'' he said. But the
United States wants to take some steps ``which we hope will be in
conformity with President Roh's desires and the desires of the
Korean people to ease the tensions on the peninsula and to create
an atmosphere which will allow for a peaceful resolution of the
differences that exist there,'' he said.
   The United States put North Korea on its list of terrorist
countries in January, citing evidence that North Korean agents were
responsible for blowing up a Korean Air Lines jet near off Burma
last November in which 115 people died. The move cancelled an
earlier relaxation of rules against informal U.S. contacts with
North Korea diplomats.
   The changes under discussion cover matters other than diplomatic
contacts and trade, the source said, declining further details.
   U.S. policymakers are not giving South Korea veto power over
U.S. decisions, the official said. ``It's going to be our
determination where we go and how far we go, but we're certainly
not going to'' upset the close relations between South Korea and
the United States, he said.
   The source said officials ``have no trouble at all'' with the
idea of cross-recognition under which South Korea would be formally
recognized by North Korea's allies, China and the Soviet Union,
while the United States, Japan and other friends of South Korea
would recognize North Korea.
   He did not comment, however, on Roh's proposal to stage a peace
conference among the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Japan
and the two Koreas.
   North Korea has staunchly resisted the kind of cross-recognition
used for more than a decade with East and West Germany, on the
grounds that it would perpetuate division of the country.

   Hurricane Joan, puzzling forecasters
with its unusual path through the southern Caribbean Tuesday,
unleashed floods in northern Colombia that left about 50 people
dead, missing or injured, officials said.
   Joan was headed toward the Colombian island resort of San
Andres, 500 miles north of the Colombian coast. On Monday, the
storm buffeted northern Colombia with heavy rains and winds of 65
mph before heading north toward Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras.
   In the northern Colombian town of Carmen de Bolivar, 360 miles
north of Bogota, at least three people were killed Monday and about
38 were missing, Victor Leon Mendoza of the Bolivar state
government said.
   A child also was killed and seven people injured Monday in the
town of Uribia on Colombia's Guajira Peninsula, police said in a
communique. Government officials called foreign reports that 200
were killed in the town ``absolutely false.''
   At 9 p.m. EDT Joan was centered near latitude 11.3 north,
longitude 77.2 west, the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,
Fla., said in a statement. It said the hurricane's center was about
310 miles southeast of San Andres and 225 miles northeast of Colon,
Panama. Joan was moving westward between 5 and 10 mph and little
change was expected overnight.
   Maximum sustained winds were near 95 mph, and satellite
photographs indicated Joan, the fifth hurricane of the Atlantic
season, might be strengthening in the next day or two.
   A hurricane watch was in effect for the north coast of Panama
from Punta San Blas to Boca del Toro and for San Andres.
   Both Costa Rica and Panama were on a state of alert.
   The Costa Rican government evacuated homeless elderly people and
children and 86 hospital patients from Puerto Limon, an Atlantic
coast port city of 8,000 people about 105 miles southeast of the
capital, San Jose, said Manuel Obando, president of the National
Emergency Committee. He said authorities were preparing to move
another 30,000 coastal residents inland.
   Obando predicted Joan would hit the coast around 6 a.m.
Wednesday if it continued on its present course.
   In Panama, civil defense authorities urged people to stay calm
and broadcast emergency instructions on radio and television.
   Long lines formed at supermarkets and pharmacies in Panama City
as people heeded warnings to stock up on supplies.
   In Colombia, Camilo Cardenas, president of the National
Emergency Committee, said in a news release that about 200 homes in
Carmen de Bolivar were destroyed or flooded.
   In Uribia, a town of 45,000, about 75 percent of the dwelings
were destroyed or flooded, police said.
   Joan's unusual southern path had forecasters puzzling over its
possible landfall.
   ``Joan is one of a kind,'' said Jim Gross, a meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center. ``You just don't see many hurricanes
that take this course and hug the coast.''
   Mark Zimmer, another meteorologist at the hurricane center, said
there was strong potential for flash floods in Costa Rica when Joan
comes ashore.
   Zimmer said winds could be near 100 mph when it hits the coast
and ``depending on how much populated area there is where the storm
does hit land, there could be wind damage.''
   Heavy rain began Tuesday morning in Costa Rica's capital of San
Jose, and Eladio Zarate, director of the country's National
Meteorological Institute, said there could be flooding on the
Atlantic coast overnight.
   In Nicaragua, where it had been raining for several days,
officials were less certain. ``We can't say if the storm will
directly affect Nicaragua at this moment,'' said Pilar Cruz,
director of Nicaragua's National Meteorological Service.
   As a tropical storm with 45 mph winds, Joan slowly built its
strength as it skimmed Colombia's coast, baffling forecasters who
had predicted it to weaken.
   It reached hurricane force Monday night when maximum sustained
winds reached 74 mph and its center began to become better defined,
a sign the system could intensify over open water into the western
Caribbean, forecasters said.
   Joan became the 10th named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season when top winds passed 39 mph on Oct. 11.
   Gilbert, the most devastating hurricane in recent years, left
more than 300 people dead and caused billions of dollars damage as
it tore through Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Mexico's Yucatan
peninsula last month.
   The six-month hurricane season ends Nov. 30.

   MIAMI _ Three Cuban prisoners, jailed at least 20 years each for
their political beliefs, arrived in the United States on Tuesday
after they were released from a Havana prison.
   Dozens of family members waited expectantly at Miami
International Airport to welcome the prisoners, Angel Pardo
Mazorra, Alberto Padron and Valentin Figueroa Galvez, known as
``plantados'' for their resistance to political rehabilitation in
Cuban jails.
   ``Don't cry, we're together ... finally, finally,'' Pardo told
his mother as he embraced her.
   Moments before, family and friends formed a tight circle around
him, hands touching his hair, clothes and face as an emotional
Pardo walked across the U.S. Customs Service lobby toward his
parents.
   Pardo, 45, served 24 years of a 30-year sentence. He hadn't seen
his parents, Angel Padro Fuentes and Delores, in 18 years. Pardo
and Padron were sponsored by the International Rescue Committee.
   Figueroa, 51, who was jailed for 24 years and came with his wife
Maria, daughter, son-in-law and their 2-year-old daughter, was
sponsored by the U.S. Catholic Conference.
   Figueroa's brother Reinaldo, a former plantado, arrived in Miami
last month after being imprisoned 24 years in Cuba.
   Two other political prisoners who were expected to accompany
U.S. Rep. William Lehman stayed behind. One man refused to leave
for personal reasons, and the other had problems with documents.
   ``I'm very happy to have my freedom,'' an ecstatic Figueroa said.
   Earlier, Figueroa's mother Teresa nervously waited.
   ``I've always had faith this day would come and my family would
be together,'' she said.
   Lehman, D-Fla., said he planned to press for the release of four
more long-term prisoners that Cuban President Fidel Castro has
refused to allow to leave the island.

   The condition of 87-year-old Emperor Hirohito
apparently grew worse early Wednesday after he vomited blood in a
health crisis that began a month ago.
   Palace spokesman Kenji Maeda said, however, that the emperor was
resting and there was no need for concern, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   The palace said Hirohito coughed up a small amount of blood
around midnight Tuesday, followed by a discharge of blood from his
bowels, and that doctors administered .42 pints in blood
transfusions.
   Hirohito has discharged blood intermittently since Sept. 19,
when an intestinal hemorrhage caused him to vomit a substantial
amount of blood and confined him to intensive care. In one month he
has received 20.2 pints in transfusions, according to news reports.
   Persistent news media reports have said Hirohito has cancer in
the area of his upper intestine. The palace has refused to comment
and asked news organizations to refrain from speculation that could
dishearten the emperor.
   Hirohito's pulse was rising slowly and reached 101 by Wednesday
morning, up from 94 a day earlier. He ran a slight fever of 99.1
degrees, Maeda told a regular news briefing. Hirohito's normal
temperature is about 95.9.
   Court physicians have unsuccessfully tried to combat his anemia
with blood transfusions. In recent days they have allowed the
world's oldest living monarch to take a few spoonfuls of weak
porridge, and acknowledged he is losing strength because his
intravenous feedings cannot supply enough nutrients.

   The Coast Guard on Tuesday rescued two men on a
sailboat who gave food and water to a starving family adrift in the
Pacific, then ran into trouble themselves, a spokesman said.
   The family was rescued last Thursday.
   The men aboard the Early Light called the Coast Guard for help
Monday, saying their boat was disabled about 60 miles northwest of
the Hawaiian island of Maui, said Coast Guard spokesman Scott
Hartvigsen.
   A C-130 search plane found the 33-foot vessel and directed the
cutter Cape Cross to the boat, Hartvigsen said. The Cape Cross
reached the men around noon.
   Hartvigsen said the Early Light would be towed to Maui. The men,
who were reported in good health, and their craft were expected to
reach the island late Wednesday, 34 days after they left California.
   When the men made their distress call, they said they had gone a
day without food and water and that a storm had broken the boat's
boom and torn its mainsail, Hartvigsen said.
   ``They gave away most of their food and water, so they were in
trouble out there,'' he said. ``But they were in radio contact with
the Coast Guard, so they knew they'd be rescued. It was just a
matter of when.''
   The men on Oct. 7 gave food, water and fishing gear to a San
Diego man and his five sons who were adrift on the Pacific Ocean
for 33 days. The Navy rescued the six Thursday 550 miles northeast
of Honolulu on Thursday.
   Clint Fleishour and his five sons were lifted off their disabled
sailboat, Paloma, after eight days without food and five days
without water.
   Fleishour said Tuesday that the crew of the Early Light, whom he
knew only as John and ``Stretch,'' gave him and his sons five
gallons of water, a fish and some fishing equipment.
   The two boats planned to sail together, but the Early Light
headed in a more westerly direction, he said.
   ``They weren't in any trouble at all when we saw them,''
Fleishour said. ``They said they had 100 gallons of water and lots
of groceries on board. They seemed like they were in really good
shape.''
   Although the Coast Guard released few details about the Early
Light, Fleishour said the crew told him they were headed from Santa
Barbara, Calif., for Maui.

   The presidential campaign motorcade
speeds down a Texas freeway at about 75 mph but without Secret
Service agents, a police escort and highway roadblocks.
   The motorcade consists of three cars _ the candidate in the
front seat of a four-door Ford that has a radar detector perched on
the dashboard and two reporters weaving their vehicles in and out
of traffic, desperately trying to keep pace.
   This is no ordinary national political campaign.
   If a dark suit, light blue shirt and red striped tie make for
the classic uniform of a presidential hopeful, then Ron Paul is
playing the part correctly. But that's where the similarity to
Republican nominee George Bush and Democratic contender Michael
Dukakis ends.

   Voters in four states will decide
whether to take a chance on a lottery in ballot measures opposed by
religious leaders and others who say state-sanctioned gambling
exploits the poor.
   Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky and Minnesota have lottery questions on
Nov. 8's ballot. The Indiana proposition also would clear the way
for parimutuel and casino gambling, if the Legislature approves.
   Polls in the states indicate support for the issues.
   Proponents, who include Gov. Wallace Wilkinson in Kentucky and
state Sen. Larry Borst in Indiana, say voting ``yes'' would bring
millions of dollars into state coffers, including much-needed money
for education and rural economic development.
   Opponents argue lotteries encourage betting by the people who
can least afford it.

   A federal ethics office will review its 1982
finding that Nancy Reagan need not disclose borrowing expensive
gowns and jewels, following reports that she has worn more than $1
million worth of such items since then.
   ``We will look at it again to see if we made the right
deciion,'' ethics office spokesman Donald Campbell said Monday.
   Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, denied that
Mrs. Reagan has kept any of the expensive items she obtained from
designers and jewelers. She said in a statement late Monday that
``Mrs. Reagan regrets that she failed to heed'' the advice of White
House counsel in 1982 to report such transactions, but that this
was not technically required under the Ethics in Government Act.
   Mrs. Crispen noted that the Office of Government Ethics had
ruled in 1982 that ``loans of apparel to Mrs. Reagan need not be
reported on the president's financial disclosure forms. No paid-for
apparel need be reported on any forms,'' the spokeswoman's
statement said.

   A routine repainting job led to the discovery
of a foot-long crack in an aging Continental Airlines Boeing 737,
five months after the government had ordered special inspections to
look for such flaws.
   A spokesman for Continental confirmed that the large crack as
well as 29 smaller ones were discovered near a window of the
first-class section after paint was stripped from the plane in
preparation for repainting Oct. 5.
   The cracks stretched about 30 inches along a joint where
sections of metal skin overlap, according to investigators of the
National Transportation Safety Board, whose metallurgists are
examining the section.
   NTSB chairman James Kolstad called it a ``chilling discovery''
in a speech Monday to an aviation group in Montreal and said it was
``frightening'' because the cracking was found ``in the same
general area'' where an Aloha Airlines plane broke apart last April
while in flight.

<HEAD>Name of the TV Game: Getting It Free, Getting It Your Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis have resorted to what the
Republican calls ``silly things,'' from exchanging stares with the
Three Little Pigs to riding an M-1 tank, to get the ultimate in
exposure _ a free minute on the network news.
   The job of making that picture and sound bite irresistible to TV
producers falls to image-makers for the two presidential candidates.
   These image-makers exert control over what gets seen on
television by confining reporters and camera-sound crews to a
twilight zone close enough for cameras but too far away for
microphones to pick up any unscripted speech.
   The result often enough: pictures of flag-draped campaign
rallies with the candidates offering snappy one-liners but no clear
discussion of the issues.
   ``That's life,'' says Richard Salant, former president of CBS
News. ``Almost everything except natural disasters are done to a
greater or lesser extent to draw the attention of the media.''
   The influence of television in the political arena goes by the
numbers:
   _At this time of year, the three network newscasts reach more
than 25 million American homes every night.
   _Deduct station breaks and commercials, and the three network
newscasts have about 22 minutes to cover the world.
   _One minute during one network news show costs a commercial
sponsor $90,000. Making that one-minute splash on all three news
shows _ the campaigns call it ``free media'' _ is a windfall worth
more than a quarter of a million dollars.
   To get their share of that limited time, campaigns must
``outguess the producer in terms of what's going to be important,''
says Robert J. Murphy, ABC's vice president for television news
coverage.
   ``What's new is the next logical step from the point of view of
the campaign manager _ once you get your view in, how do you keep
everything else out of it,'' he said. ``That's what the Reagan
administration has done, very effectively, and that's now what
campaign managers are being judged on.''
   The managers, especially the Bush managers, are being judged in
some quarters as entirely too effective.
   ``More than ever before, the whole campaign is in the control of
image-makers,'' says Salant.
   Bush, who has many of the same advisers who worked with Reagan,
has used his status as a sitting vice president to produce some
striking images in the campaign. He was shown witnessing the
destruction of the first U.S. missiles under the treaty with the
Soviet Union and greeting the Discovery astronauts after the space
shuttle landed in California.
   Dukakis sought to turn that around, unleashing a series of
television commercials on ``The Packaging of George Bush.''
   The Democratic presidential candidate also has tried to use
``free media'' to his own advantage.
   Just this week, Dukakis borrowed a trumpet and played a few bars
of ``Happy Days are Here Again.'' It was a made-for-TV visual and
sound bite, but one that may have backfired because it was coupled
with reports showing Dukakis dropping in the polls.
   During a recent campaign stop in Illinois, Bush acknowledged,
``We all do silly things in campaigns.''
   ``I wish you could have been with me out there in Disneyland,''
he said. ``I was standing there and these three little pigs kept
staring at me, so I know what it is to be on the receiving end and
do dumb things. ...
   ``But the one that takes the cake was him riding around in that
tank, the governor of Massachusetts in that tank,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis' ride in an M-1 tank across a grassy field in Michigan
on Sept. 13 was undertaken to respond to Bush's charges that he was
soft on defense.
   Roger Ailes, media adviser to Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and
now to Bush, has said that the news is much more important than
advertising in defining a candidate. It is Ailes' job, and the job
of his counterparts in the Dukakis campaign, to define the news.
   What happens when control is threatened?
   After the presidential candidates met in two debates with
formats dictated by the two campaigns, Bush declined an offer by
ABC's ``Nightline'' for a free-for-all session with Dukakis.
   ``Frankly, our campaign schedule requires the candidate to be on
the road after the second debate, taking his message to the voters
directly,'' Bush spokesman Mark Goodin explained. He did not
mention the minimum of 5 million households that tune in nightly to
``Nightline.''
   Robert A. Mossbacher Sr., Bush's finance chairman, has said that
$30 million to $35 million of the campaign's funds will go for
television advertising, the lion's share of the $54.4 million it is
allowed to spend overall.
   The Dukakis campaign has said it plans a comparable TV blitz.
   ``It's nobody's fault, it's what's happening with the times,''
Frederick Koenig, professor of social psychology at Tulane
University, said of the campaigns' heavy reliance on television.
   Koenig says studies showed voters in the past chose a candidate
by picking up information from speeches and then discussing it with
others. ``I can remember growing up that people would sit around
and argue politics, sitting on their porches or in bars,'' he said.
   Now, in a time when the A.C. Nielsen Co. says the average viewer
has the TV set on for 6 hours, 59 minutes per day and increasing
numbers of families have more than one set, people don't even
discuss television shows with each other, Koenig said.
   ``There has been a fragmentation of opinion-forming,'' he said.
   At the same time, the candidates are getting less time on the
air.
   Voters used to hear half-hour and even one-hour political
speeches on radio or television, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a
professor of communications at the University of Texas and author
of ``Packaging the Presidency.'' By 1964, she said, 60-second spots
became popular and now the 30-second spot is the norm.
   Network news executives believe long stories drive away
audiences, she said, and that reinforces the public's expectation
that it will get short stories.
   ``There has been more substance in this campaign than is clear
to people who are watching the network news,'' Jamieson said.
   Michael Robinson, associate professor of government at
Georgetown University, says that suits voters, too. ``They have
always been interested in brevity, and we have this romantic notion
that at some point the voters were really actively involved in the
process. They weren't,'' Robinson says.
   CBS correspondent Bob Schieffer, who has traveled with the Bush
campaign, said ``I think we do have to resist a pretty picture
every so often.'' Schieffer said he drew the line on Labor Day when
Bush set out to help load fish in San Diego.
   ``I declined to use the pictures in my story because I thought
it was silly, because I didn't think it had anything to do with his
qualifications to be president,'' Schieffer said.
   Jamieson said television still can help voters become deeply
informed.
   The C-Span cable television channel runs unedited speeches by
the presidential candidates most evenings, for example, and public
television's MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour tackles issues in depth.

<HEAD>Extreme Views on the Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A seldom mentioned consequence of the
spectacular collapse of securities markets one year ago today is
that it seems to have made almost anything sound plausible.
   What, for example?
   Well, double digit inflation and interest rates, another market
collapse to 500 points on the Dow Jones industrial average,
depression _ or, if you prefer, the most stunningly strong economy
you could ever imagine.
   People out there are peddling all those notions, and others, and
many of them are considered investment advisers. No matter how
their views might differ they share one belief in common: Fear
sells.
   Consider this advertisement for Richard C. Young's International
Gold Report: ``How to Cash in on the Dukakis Disaster & Let Jesse
Jackson Make You a Millionaire.''
   The thesis is that Dukakis and his Cabinet member, Jackson,
would spend the nation into bankrupcty, leaving gold as the only
sane way for people to make money or protect what they already have.
   What if Bush wins?
   ``In either case _ Dukakis or Bush _ the U.S. dollar will hit
the pits long before the economy goes thud. Bank on it. Inflation
will settle in like lice on the body politic,'' the ad says.
   Adrian Day, publisher of Adrian Day's Investment Analyst, claims
to be ``the man who made more money for more people than any
investment adviser in history,'' but that's not the reason he is
selling bad times.
   ``I'm not writing just to tell you what a great guy I am,'' he
says, but to warn you ``that the next couple of years will be
tougher, meaner and more treacherous than any period in the last
two decades.''
   On the anniversary of the great stock market crash it isn't only
the market letter writers who are offering unusual views. Some
large brokerage houses are, in effect and sometimes in words,
declaring that we are now in a new era.
   The new era, it is suggested, calls for investments in sound
values rather than in hot stocks, a long-term rather than a
short-term view, reasonable expectations, a concern for fundamental
values and the like.
   But a new era? The truth is that such concepts have never gone
out of style, except in some areas of the securities community,
they being fundamental to investing as opposed to trading.
   Economists also, but perhaps to a lesser extent, have had their
thinking affected by the big collapse. Among some, there appears to
have developed a competition to find where the economy's weak spots
may be developing.
   As a result, falling unemployment and rising production
repeatedly have been viewed with alarm. More recently, the
recession-watchers have shifted to inventory buildups. And almost
constantly, retail sales are watched for signs.
   Perhaps the zaniest fear of all is that expressed by those who
view the anniversary of the 1987 crash, by itself, as somehow
capable of stirring up another disaster.
   The economy, meanwhile, has performed as well as it possibly
could, given the problems of budget and trade deficits. It has
shown much more assurance, steadiness, restraint and sense of
direction than have its observers.
   It suggests, oddly, that the peddlers of fear and the extreme
thinkers may be doing some good. Conceivably, their reminders might
have something to do with keeping the economy on the straight and
narrow.

<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Simon, who only stuffs basketball hoops
from the bottom, was down in the schoolyard with baseball legend
Mickey Mantle, sportscaster John Madden and midget slam-dunker Spud
Webb, playing stickball and basketball for the cameras.
   A perfect two days of work, he says, to make a video of his old
hit, ``Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.'' The song is one of 16
on a new retrospective released this week by Warner Bros. called
``Negotiations and Love Songs.'' It is his first album since
``Graceland'' came out in 1986.
   As one of pop music's most respected songwriters, the
Grammy-winning artist said he isn't repeating himself. ``I'm not
doing something over but, on the other hand, I'm developing ideas
I've had for a long time.''
   In a recent interview at the Hit Factory studio, where he's
working on a percussion-oriented album for release next summer,
Simon talked about the new LP. He said he selected certain tunes to
demonstrate the best example of his work over the last 15 years
after splitting with Art Garfunkel.
   The songs appear in the order in which they came out on Simon's
solo records, starting with ``Mother and Child Reunion'' and ``Me
and Julio'' from his first solo LP, ``Paul Simon,'' in 1972.
   ``I think it works better in terms of sound, the instrumentation
and recording techniques,'' he said. ``I think it's less confusing
to the ear than mixing them all up, in my case.''
   He originally left out ``Kodachrome,'' which he described as a
``straight-ahead pop hit'' of the '70s, then put it back on because
people like it.
   ``I tend to like later work better than earlier work as my
skills develop,'' he said. ``And my outlook naturally is more
synchronized with how I feel now. If I'm talking about subject
matter that's 15 years old, that's what I thought 15 years ago. The
songs are like snapshots.''
   Not only do his songs form lasting pictures of moments in his
life, but also reflect his artistic growth.
   ``Mother and Child Reunion'' is interesting to him because it
was his first reggae piece. ``Me and Julio'' has a Caribbean flavor
and he used Brazilian percussion on it.
   ``Something So Right'' marks his first meeting with the
award-winning producer-composer-musician Quincy Jones, who became a
good friend. Jones did the arrangement on the tune.
   ``St. Judy's Comet'' is a lullaby to his 16-year-old son,
Harper, when he was a baby. Harper plays guitar and ``has come out
of reggae into the Grateful Dead. He also likes Paul Simon, much to
my surprise,'' says his father.
   Another song on the new LP, ``Loves Me Like a Rock'' represents
Simon's interest in gospel music.
   ``Have a Good Time'' has sax player Phil Woods. ``50 Ways to
Leave Your Lover'' was the first time he worked with Steve Gadd and
the New York Rhythm Section.
   ``I thought I made some of my best records with that rhythm
section,'' he said. The ``50 Ways'' single also sold more than 1
million copies.
   ``Still Crazy After All These Years'' was the 1975 Grammy album
of the year. It also won best pop male vocalist for Simon.
   ``Late in the Evening'' is Latin influenced. ``I'm interested in
that and working with that now,'' he said. ``On `Slip Slidin'
Away,' I worked with the Oak Ridge Boys. It was a movement toward
country.
   ``My `Hearts and Bones Album,' the one before `Graceland,' is
not familiar to most people. It didn't have any hit singles. It was
a very autobiographical album and a very serious, somber album. The
songs I included from it I think are three of my best songs. They
weren't released as singles.''
   The tunes are the title song, ``Train in the Distance,'' which
includes the phrase ``Negotiations and Love Songs,'' and ``Rene and
Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After the War.''
   Simon ends the LP with two songs from the Grammy-winning
``Graceland'' album: ``Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,'' and
``You Can Call Me Al.'' Graceland sold more than 3 million copies.
   ``I just keep reviewing the elements I've been interested in
from the '60s and even earlier,'' Simon said. ``I heard Latin and
gospel music along with rock 'n' roll when I was a kid growing up
in New York. Those are the elements of my work _ early sounds that
I really liked, early rhythms that I remember.
   ``You go back and you recapitulate. And every time you
reinvestigate, it goes deeper and you begin to more clearly focus
on what it is that you really respond to emotionally or musically.
And those are the elements that you keep.''
   Because of that, Simon says, his work becomes increasingly
interesting. ``What is not interesting is making Top 40 hits. If it
happens, it is just a pleasant surprise. At the early point of my
career _ Simon and Garfunkel _ everything was a hit. And we wanted
it to be.''
   When the 47-year-old songwriter composes he's primarily
concerned with his own generation and with an entire album instead
of individual songs. ``I want people to like it and find it
interesting. It doesn't necessarily have to be great numbers of
people. I want people to say, `I don't know how many people are
going to like this, but I like it.'''
   Simon won't tour with ``Negotiations and Love Songs,'' but may
go out after next summer's album.
   ``I think in my case, the music is better when you play it
live,'' he said. ``A song takes a couple of days to make in a
studio. When you're playing that song for six months, you start off
copying the arrangement of the record. Most of the time it gets
more interesting and more complex musically. Very often musicians
work out things they didn't fully work out on the record date.
   ``You usually have a bigger band. There is room for soloists to
play. As a vocalist you have a chance to rethink the phrasing, even
the melody.''

   In the twilight of President Reagan's

dear to the religious right, but he's made them practically a
political staple.
   They simmer in the current national campaign, and religious
scholars say Reagan has excelled at using his office as a ``bully
pulpit'' for his upbeat-style sermonizing.
   ``The Reagan years have been good for public theology'' despite
its often thin quality, writes church historian Martin Marty.
``Religion, which had seemed a private affair in the 1970s, went
public again in the l980s.''
   Marty of the University of Chicago notes that in Reagan's
presidency, growing attention has centered on such issues as
values, virtue, education, moral formation, sexuality, family life,
abortion and euthanasia.
   Rabbi A. James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee writes in
the Christian Century that Reagan ``is clearly the dominant
American theologian of the l980s.''
   But the content, he adds, is ``only sparkling optimisim _
theological Perrier.''
   While Reagan has not achieved most of his social agenda, such as
banning abortion, reinstating prayers in schools and providing tax
credits for children in private schools, he's still preaching them.
   They're also backed by his party's candidate to succeed him,
George Bush. Says Reagan:
   ``Although we Americans have done much to put our national life
back on the firm foundation of traditional values, there is still a
great deal to be done.''
   He told a summer Youth for Christ rally in Washington that ``as
a nation we must embrace our faith, for as long as we endeavor to
do good...we will find our strength, our hope and our true
happiness in prayer and the Lord's will.''
   Although Reagan rarely attends church himself, he strikes his
vintage religious chords. He told the youths:
   ``I would like someday to entertain an atheist at dinner and
serve the most gourmet, perfect dinner that has ever been served,
and then at the end of the meal, ask that atheist if he believes
there's a cook.''
   He said 4,000 abortions a day ``must stop,'' and he said Vice
President Bush ``believes with me'' about it. ``Abortion is the
taking of a human life.''
   ``So far, we haven't succeeded in persusading the Congress to
enact legislation that would once again permit voluntary prayer in
America's schools,'' he said. ``But I'm convinced that, one day
soon, such a measure will be passed.''
   In Reagan's term, Congress has repeatedly rejected measures to
authorize school prayers, give tax breaks for for private school
tuition or to amend the constitution to overturn the Supreme Court
decision allowing abortion.
   Some leaders of the religious right, which had strongly backed
Reagan for the presidency, have criticized him as not pushing hard
enough for the measures, suggesting he gave them only lip service.
   While the Christian right emerged as a political force in the
1980s, it is losing ``influence on the national level,'' says
historian Leo Ribuffo of George Washington University.
   However, historian Marty advices against underestimating it,
saying it ``did get people talking about the family and personal
values.''
   He says it has gained legitimacy by adding ``scores of causes''
to its prime anti-abortion cause, and also has overcome objections
to its involvement in politics.
   ``By and large the New Christian Right won its point'' _ that it
had a legitimate voice in politics, Marty writes in Context, his
journal of commentary on religion and culture.
   But he says the Christian rightists ``did not win much'' in the
Reagan years. ``They wanted less government and they got more; they
wanted less debt and ended up with the greatest ever; they wanted
dismantled social welfare programs and got some, but it was
selective.''
   However, Reagan asserted a ``major victory'' in the Supreme
Court's recent upholding of an act allowing grants to religious
groups to counsel the young against promiscuity.
   On that subject, he offered his advice to 9000 youths at their
Congress on Evangelism, saying ``it's important for you not to pay
any attention at all to all those who say that promiscuity is
somehow stylish or rewarding.''
   He said ``the right thing to do is to wait for that one special
person.'' To be true in marriage, he said, ``you can start being
true to that one special person beginning now.''
   Reagan also took credit for the Equal Rights Act, giving
religious groups the same right to meet after school the same as
other clubs. However, schools are still refusing to do so,
challenging the law in court.
   Recalling a story of the country's origins, Reagan played one of
his frequent themes:
   ``If Benjamin Franklin rose to invoke the Almighty as the
Constitution itself was being drafted _ if the Congress of the
United States opens each day with prayer _ then isn't it time we
let God back into the classroom?''

   The Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson says
severe financial strain from continued ownership of television
station KDTU has forced elimination of 14 jobs, suspension of some
services and imposition of salary cuts.
   ``The financial resources of the diocese have been severely
pressured by the continuing financial demands caused by the
diocesan-owned television station,'' Bishop Manuel D. Moreno said
in a letter to parishes.
   He said efforts have failed over the last three years to sell
the UHF station, Channel 18, which went on the air in 1984, and the
``continuing demands caused by its operations'' have forced
reductions in diocesan services to parishes.
   The bishop said the cutbacks, however, would not affect regular
parish operations nor parish employees since parish budgets are
administered independently. He also said Catholic Community
Services, Catholic schools and cemeteries would be unaffected.

   WILKES_BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A King's College political scientist
says that just as there no longer is a unified ``Catholic vote'' in
America, the ``Catholic lobby'' also is fragmented.
   The Rev. Thomas J. O`Hare, who has examined 31 separate
Washington-based Catholic interest groups advocating various public
policy positions, says many scholars mistakenly considered the
Catholic lobby ``a monolith.''
   ``That really is a distorted view,'' he says. O'Hara, who has
written a chapter on the multifaceted Catholic lobby in a new book,
``Religion in American Politics,'' says:
   ``There are Catholic pacifists, feminists, traditionalist and
advocates of positions on many policy issues. Some are to the left
of the bishops and some are to the right.''

<HEAD>Television Serves as Islamic Moral Guardian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Viewers may tire of a mullah chanting
from the Moslem holy book, but there is no alternative when he's
on. The government runs television in Pakistan and uses it as a
watchdog of Islamic morality.
   ``Pakistan television has prepared interesting programs
reflecting Islamic social values for the October-to-December
quarter,'' program director Zaheer Bhatti told the government news
agency.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, he said that should
not be interpreted as fundamentalist or reactionary.
   Bhatti dismissed the self-righteous view of Western television
as a sinkhole of promiscuity, alcoholism and drug addiction, but
also said there are basic differences between East and West, Moslem
and non-Moslem.
   ``We want to make (the young) aware of the positive values in
our society,'' he said. ``We don't see the past of any society as a
separate entity. It is a progression and we say we are a
progressive religion.''
   Television is a tool for preserving Pakistani culture, Bhatti
said, and mentioned such things as keeping traditional dress from
being supplanted by T-shirts, jeans and three-piece suits.
   Weekly television series display the cultures of Pakistan's five
provinces. Love is a common theme, with the young in search of love
often pitted against an older generation clinging to the tradition
of arranged marriages.
   ``We don't believe in sermonizing through the box,'' Bhatti
said. ``We do not talk down to people; we talk to people.''
   A series called ``Waris'' was a favorite of the late President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   It was set in the interior of Punjab province and told of a
powerful, dictatorial landowner who clashed with his sons and
tenants.
   Some Pakistanis said the landlord was intended as a portrayal of
former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged in 1979,
two years after Gen. Zia overthrew him in a mlitary coup.
   Bhutto's daughter Benazir now leads the Pakistan People's Party,
which was founded by her father and is the main political
opposition.
   About two months before his death in a plane crash Aug. 17, Zia
announced that Pakistan would adopt Islamic law.
   Women protested in the streets, feeling their hard-won gains
would slip away, and whether to implement Islamic law now will be
left to the government organized after elections Nov. 16.
   Subtle changes began occuring on Pakistan television after Zia's
pronouncement and continued after his death.
   Fewer women were seen on the tube, particularly in commercials,
and more covered their heads. Women anchoring the evening news wore
headscarves.
   Bhatti acknowledged the number of women in commercials has been
reduced.
   Glamorous women in skin-tight dresses slipping into the latest
car never were part of Pakistani television, but Bhatti said even
tamer depictions of women to sell products is being reduced.
   If a product is for use by either men or women, a man will
appear in the ommercial, he said, and ``the unnecessary use of
females to sell products'' will be stopped.
   Foreign programs will continue to appear because Pakistan's
television industry cannot produce enough programs to fill the
time, but officials are selective, he said.
   Dramas are included, but the emphasis is on such educational and
informative programs as documentaries by Jacques Cousteau and the
National Geographic Society.

   Is there life after ``The Phantom of the Opera''
for Michael Crawford?
   Emphatically ``yes'' says the man who conquered Broadway last
season, carting off every theater award in sight, including a Tony.
Now Crawford has left the cast of the New York production of
``Phantom,'' but even his departure from the hit musical was
spectacular.
   After missing more than a week because of a virus, the star
returned Oct. 8 for one final performance. During curtain calls,
the entire cast showered Crawford with red roses. They were
assisted by members of the audience, some of them running down the
aisles of the Majestic Theater to toss flowers on the stage.
   An emotional Crawford spoke to the theatergoers, choking on what
he said was the same thing he told his mother on his 21st birthday.
   ``I'd like to thank you for having me,'' he told the cheering
crowd.
   ``You're perfection,'' yelled one enthusiastic woman.
   But Crawford has not hung up his ``Phantom'' mask and put away
his makeup for good. The actor plans to do at least a nine-month
engagement, beginning next May, in the Los Angeles company of
``Phantom.'' It's the best possible audition for the movies.
   ``The film people are there, and they'd see it,'' he says. ``I
have got very strong interest and offers from two studios. If I'm
in Los Angeles, I can work on development as it is happening.''
   Crawford has made movies before. Film buffs know him from ``The
Knack,'' ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,''
``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``How I Won the War.'' But this is the first
time a movie will be planned around him. What a difference a hit
musical can make to a career.
   ``I don't think I was known over here at all,'' Crawford says.
In England, he was a star. He appeared in several hit British
television series and had done three big musicals in London's West
End _ ``Billy,'' ``Flowers for Algernon'' and ``Barnum.'' The last
show, an American musical, had an even longer run in England than
it did in the United States.
   ``It ran so long we had births and deaths in the audience,''
Crawford says. ``People died, and we had a woman give birth once.
It was like life aboard a 747 on an around-the-world trip.''
   ``Phantom'' _ with the help of exposure on national television
shows such as ``West 57th Street'' _ has made his face familiar to
fans in the United States.
   ``When I first opened in `Phantom' in New York even the stage
managers would ask, `Are you Michael Crawford?,''' he says. Before
he left the show, there were crowds of 50 to 60 people waiting each
night at the stage door to see him.
   And the letters never stopped coming. Every day he would receive
more than 100 letters, some from overseas and addressed simply,
``Michael Crawford, Broadway, U.S.A.''
   Crawford's most dedicated followers have been an informal group
of Britishers called the OGRES, which stands for Opera Ghosts
Return Enthusiasts. Many of them came to New York for his final
Broadway appearance. Some had been here twice before, unfurling
banners down the Majestic alleyway that proclaimed ``Bring Him
Home.''
   ``There are about 25 of them and they won't let anyone else
join,'' he says. ``They are very exclusive. And if anyone
misbehaves, they are out. Or if they bother me. They don't like to
annoy me. They are very good to me.''
   Crawford also has widened his appeal with his first solo
recording, ``Songs From the Stage and Screen'' that he made before
he opened ``Phantom'' in New York.
   ``They have sold over 200,000 copies on the East Coast, so it's
on its way to gold,'' he says. ``And I'm very pleased. There was a
terrific amount of care gone into that record.''
   The album, which includes a medley of songs from ``West Side
Story'' and such Broadway classics as ``If I Loved You,''
``Memory'' and ``You'll Never Walk Alone,'' has sold well all over
the world.
   ``It's triple platinum in New Zealand, which means it has sold
20,000 copies,'' Crawford says. ``Even the sheep are buying it.''
   Crawford will go back into the recording studio early next year
in London to record a second album, this time a collection of love
songs. He hopes to include ``Music of the Night,'' his big number
from ``Phantom,'' if composer Andrew Lloyd Webber grants his
permission.
   The performer also is considering several new Broadway musicals,
although none he can talk about. ``But it's nice that I've been
asked,'' he says. ``And one of them is of particular interest to
me.''
   After his final performance in ``Phantom,'' a role now being
played by Timothy Nolen, Crawford flew to Australia to make a
documentary film for a British charity. Then he may begin to relax
for a few weeks.
   Crawford admits he'll miss the hoopla that accompanied his
10-month ``Phantom'' run in New York, although there are tradeoffs.
   ``I'll be glad to have it quiet after all that attention,'' he
says. ``You need that quiet whenever you have finished a show that
is an event.''

<HEAD>Pardon for Butting In But USDA Has Something To Say About Goats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In case George Bush and Michael Dukakis want
to talk about goats, the Agriculture Department has some new
material speechwriters can use. No kidding. It would be good for
rebuttal, too.
   Goats are among the most non-controversial farm topics around.
They haven't been involved in any huge USDA subsidy flap and are
not a big legislative issue on Capitol Hill.
   Moreover, while city folk may have trouble identifying with
modern feedlots that send beef to their tables, or the farrowing
pens that turn out pork chops and sausage, just about everyone
feels good about goats.
   ``Since before biblical times, goats may have been the most
useful of domesticated animal, producing milk for drinking or for
cheese, gourmet meat (cabrito), leather, and fiber for clothing
(cashmere or Angora), not to be confused with Angora (rabbit)
wool,'' says the department's Cooperative State Research Service.
   The goat report is the latest in a series of single-sheet papers
turned out by the agency's Office for Small-Scale Agriculture.
Others include such topics as sheep, mushrooms, foliage plants,
herbs, wildflowers and specialty vegetables.
   Goats are relatively clean and make ``fine pets and show
animals,'' the report said. Worldwide, there may be as many 460
million, which produce an estimated 4.5 million metric tons of milk
annually.
   But before people quit the city job, politics or other endeavor,
there are some things they should know about raising goats for a
living or as a supplement to other income.
   ``They, of course, need care to keep dogs away and skillful
management to prevent diseases and internal as well as external
parasites such as lice, mites and fleas,'' the report said. ``Goat
milk is so respected that there have been people who began raising
dairy goats before learning whether they could sell the milk or
knew how to make cheese.''
   One problem is that in at least 21 states, goat milk must be
pasteurized, or heated to a prescribed temperature, to kill
potentially harmful bacteria. And pasteurization can cost a bundle
for equipment.
   Where milk can be sold raw, herds must be licensed and the
nannies must be carefully tested and kept free of brucellosis and
tuberculosis, which are contagious to humans.
   Lest anyone sneer at someone's plan to operate a goat ranch on a
couple of acres beyond the zoning of outer surburbia, goats have
assumed something of a Washington hauteur of late.
   In 1987, for the first time, Congress and President Reagan
recognized the merits of the dairy goat, proclaiming a National
Dairy Goat Awareness Week.
   President Reagan, it was said, supported the idea
enthusiastically and had recalled ``with fondness the time about 25
years ago when each or our two doe goats had quintuplets on our
ranch in California.''
   Goats are raised for non-dairy purposes such as for meat and
leather or fine hair, the report said. Farmers and ranchers who are
already pasturing some sheep or cattle, or both, may be able to add
some goats without any problems.
   ``Goats eat some plants that sheep and cattle don't seek, so
they are not mutually exclusive,'' the report said. ``They pasture
well together.''
   The meat, or cabrito _ sometimes called chevon _ has little fat
and ``tastes better than venison,'' the report said. Worldwide,
production is more than 1.2 million metric tons a year.
   ``With a flock of 350 to 400 Spanish does, Bob Buckholz of
Dripping Springs, Texas, who raises goats for meat, annually sells
their offspring for meat at eight months of age for $30 a head,''
the report said.
   ``Since the stock is tough, thrifty and hardy, he has lots of
pasture and some Pyrenees dogs to keep predators such as coyotes
and wild dogs at bay, Buckholz's expenses are relatively small.''
   Tom and Helen Hill, Lake Butler, Fla., sometimes feed young
goats, or kids, only about two months until they reach 35 to 40
pounds. The young animals are then sold at nearly $1 a pound in the
Miami area, where there is often a shortage of goats in November
and December.
   For free single copies of the report, ``Goats,'' or any of the
others published so far, write to: Office for Small-Scale
Agriculture, Cooperative State Research Service, Office of Grants

   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. launched an $11 billion
cash tender offer for Kraft Inc., a bid that would be the second
biggest corporate acquisition in U.S. history if it succeeds.
   The only deal bigger was the $13.4 billion purchase of Gulf
Corp. in 1984 by Standard Oil Co. of California, which later
changed its name to Chevron Corp.
   Philip Morris said it had no plans to sell off any parts of
Kraft to finance the deal. The offer of $90 a share in cash,
announced Monday, was 51 percent above Kraft's current stock price.

   But sources close to the talks said Monday the meetings this
weekend adjourned after the two sides failed to agree on an offer
for the airline.
   Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., was seeking
wage concessions from the Eastern unions that union leaders
considered too severe, according to the sources, who spoke on

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. lost a round in its
fight against civil fraud charges when a senior judge rejected the
Wall Street giant's motion that he quit the case.
   In an angrily worded opinion, U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack
also denied Drexel motions to stop him from ruling on other cases
involving the firm and convicted insider trader Ivan Boesky.
   Pollack, a respected 82-year-old jurist who has been presiding
over most Boesky-related litigation for more than a year, deemed
the defense strategy to remove him on grounds of prejudice a
ludicrous, time-wasting ploy.

   Monday's ruling could further complicate Maxwell's efforts to

Macmillan senior management.
   Maxwell has offered $2.51 billion for Macmillan under certain

   Business inventories continued their steady
rise in August but economists remain untroubled because the
expansion is not outpacing strong sales.
   The Commerce Department said Monday goods held on shelves and
backlots rose 0.8 percent to $733.7 billion, following a 0.7
percent gain in July. It was the 20th consecutive monthly increase.
   Compared with a year ago, inventories are up 8.7 percent while

percent of capacity, down 0.2 percentage points from August.
   In July, the rate also was 83.8 percent, soaring to an
eight-year high from 83.0 percent in June as utilities produced

   Federal regulators have opened seven
investigations into alleged defects in vehicles made by major
manufacturers.
   The possible defects include brake problems in all 1988
Chevrolet and GMC half-ton pickup trucks, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said Monday. The defective bolts in
the trucks may break off and come to rest in the brake assembly,
potentially causing the vehicles to go out of control.
   The agency said none of the alleged defects have been confirmed.
About 100,000 light trucks made by General Motors Corp. were
involved in the investigation, NHTSA said.

   The stock market has gotten a modest boost from new government
reports pointing to an economic slowdown.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.29 points Monday
to 2,140.47.
   The Commerce Department reported that goods held on shelves and
backlots in August rose 0.8 percent to $733.7 billion, following a
0.7 percent gain in July. It was the 20th consecutive monthly
increase.
   Rising inventories can be a sign of economic sluggishness as
manufacturers order production cuts and layoffs while goods in
reserve are sold off.
   In another government report, the Federal Reserve Board said the
overall operating rate last month at U.S. factories, mines and
utilities fell to 83.6 percent of capacity, down 0.2 percentage
point from August.
   The strain on the nation's industrial capacity eased for the
first time in seven months as utilities scaled back after the
summer heat wave, the Fed said.
   The latest government reports also supported bond prices,
driving interest rates lower. The yield on the Treasury's closely
watched 30-year bond fell to 8.86 percent from 8.90 percent late
Friday.
   In foreign-exchange trading, the dollar rose against most major
currencies after reports of intervention by the Bank of Japan
lifted it from its lows of the day. The U.S. currency finished in
New York at around 127.07 Japanese yen, up from 126.70 yen late
Friday.
   As part of its business inventories report, the Commerce
Department said August sales totaled $487.7 billion, up a brisk 1.1
percent from July, when the gain was a slight 0.1 percent. It was
the ninth increase in a row.
   In other economic developments Monday:
   _A Harvard Business Review report concluded that an entrenched
budget deficit and fundamental policy flaws have destabilized the
nation's economy, and the next president will have to take major
steps to turn it around.
   _The oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council
said they supported an increase in OPEC's output quotas as a way to
try to stabilize prices.
   Analysts said stock traders took a generally upbeat view of the
current state of the economy, believing that growth has slowed of
late to a steady, sustainable pace.
   But inflation worries haven't been entirely snuffed out on Wall
Street, and brokers said investors were looking ahead warily to
Friday's scheduled report on the consumer price index for September.
   Furthermore, just about all market-watchers agree, investors are
likely to be leery of stocks all week with the anniversary
Wednesday of last fall's crash, and all the attendant publicity.

   Energy futures prices continue to climb, but
analysts warn that trading will be volatile while OPEC members hold
a series of meetings in hopes of lowering crude oil production.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 29 cents Monday to close at $15.21 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Subsequent contract months settled about 22 cents a barrel
higher. Analysts said the November contract had additional strength
because of tight supplies.
   Refined products traded on the exchange followed a similar
pattern, with near-term contracts posting the largest gains. The
November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline picked up 1.34
cents to settle at 46.76 cents a gallon, while the November
contract for home heating oil rose 0.67 cent to 43.88 cents a
gallon.
   Prices zigzagged Monday before rising amid optimism that the
OPEC meetings could end the cartel's overproduction problems.
   ``People are expecting a lot of volatility in the market for the
next few weeks,'' said Jim Fiedler, a trader with E.D.&F. Man
International Futures Inc. ``The market still looks strong, but
people are afraid it's overbought and will run out of good news to
keep it up.''
   Oil prices fell below $12.30 two weeks ago because of
overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, then began to climb as meetings to discuss the situation
approached.
   This past weekend, oil ministers of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council met and proposed a production ceiling of 18.5
million to 19 million barrels a day for the 13 OPEC members.
   The GCC proposal is expected to be presented to OPEC's
committees on strategy and pricing, which are meeting Thursday in
Madrid, Spain. OPEC also has a ministerial conference scheduled for
Nov. 21.
   ``It's going to be meeting, meeting, meeting, and that's going
to keep the market in an uproar,'' Fiedler said.

<HEAD>Firm Says It Will Appeal In Effort Remove Judge From Fraud Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will appeal a
judge's refusal to quit presiding over the government's massive
civil-fraud suit against the firm, raising the prospect of more
delays and pretrial theatrics in a case that already has acquired
celebrity status in Manhattan federal court.
   Although U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack's angry rejection
Monday of Drexel's move to disqualify him was seen outwardly as a
setback for the Wall Street giant, some attorneys following the
courtroom battle saw it as a plus for the defense, which is trying
to portray Drexel as a victim of prejudice.
   ``You can't lose,'' said one attorney, who spoke on condition he
not be identified. ``This effort has to be for the purpose of
creating the picture that Drexel is a fine company mistreated by
the courts.''
   Pollack denied Drexel motions to stop him from ruling on its
case as well as in other cases involving the firm and Ivan Boesky,
the imprisoned inside trader who implicated Drexel and others in
alleged wrongdoing when he was exposed nearly two years ago.
   Pollack, a respected 82-year-old jurist who has been presiding
over most Boesky-related litigation for more than a year, deemed
the defense strategy to remove him a ludicrous, time-wasting ploy.
   His opinion seemed to further raise the level of antagonism
between Drexel lawyers and the judge since the Securities and
Exchange Commission filed its wide-ranging fraud suit against the
firm and other defendants last month.
   Pollack already has chastised several defense lawyers for their
conduct in the case and referred two of them to the chief judge of
Manhattan federal court for possible disciplinary sanctions.
   A raucous hearing last week on defense efforts to disqualify
Pollack on grounds of possible bias featured emotional exchanges
between him and Drexel attorneys, who are among the most highly
paid in the country. That session drew a packed audience, unusual
in securities law cases.
   SEC lawyers applauded Pollack's opinion Monday and expressed
eagerness to proceed. Private attorneys suing Drexel and Boesky
also welcomed the ruling.
   Defense attorneys did not return telephone calls for comment.
But Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said in a statement: ``Our
attorneys had a professional obligation to bring this issue before
the court. Since it is their considered view that, based on the
facts in the motion, Judge Pollack's position is incorrect, the
matter will be placed before the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.''
   Drexel claims Pollack has a conflict of interest because his
wife, Moselle, stands to gain $30 million from the sale of her
stock in Palais Royal Inc., a Houston-based concern going private
in a transaction that indirectly involves Drexel financing.
   Although Mrs. Pollack's financial interest would make it appear
that Pollack is biased in Drexel's favor, defense lawyers had
argued they wanted a judge whose impartiality could not possibly be
questioned by the public.
   ``There is no financial or business connection, or other
relationship between Mrs. Pollack and Drexel,'' the judge wrote.
   ``There is simply no reasonable basis for doubting the court's
impartiality in this case by reason of the Palais Royal stock sale;
no facts, no rational basis, have been supplied.''
   Pollack wrote that Drexel's motion seemed so far-fetched ``as to
be ludicrous and hardly a basis for a judge to step aside.''
   Privately, many lawyers have speculated the Drexel defense wants
another judge because of Pollack's reputation as a tough,
no-nonsense securities-law expert tending to side with the
government in fraud cases.
   Legal experts familiar with courtroom strategies to disqualify
judges doubted the Drexel effort to remove Pollack would prevail.
   ``It is fairly common to use a motion to disqualify as sort of a
diversion,'' said Arthur Miller, a professor at Harvard Law School.
   ``Sometimes the strategy is serious, when there are reasons to
fear the judge. Sometimes the motion is made because you don't like
the judge,'' Miller said. ``It generally fails, miserably.''
   The SEC sued Drexel and four key employees of the firm Sept. 7
alleging they secretly plotted with Boesky to manipulate stock,
profit on inside information about corporate takeovers, cheat
clients and engage in other frauds. The defendants have denied the
charges.

   Wall Street was kept in the dark, as the law
requires, before Philip Morris Companies Inc. announced its $11
billion bid for Kraft Inc.
   The best evidence that there were no widespread leaks of the
surprise takeover bid late Monday is that trading in both stocks
was about average and there were no big price changes. The offer
was announced after the close of trading.
   Small amounts of insider trading would not affect volumes or
prices, but a rumor that traveled far quickly would have pushed
Kraft's stock price toward Philip Morris's offer of $90 a share,
and trading would have been heavy.
   In consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Kraft
stock rose 62{ cents a share to $60.12{. Philip Morris stock rose
$1.37{ a share to $100.
   Trading in Kraft was 123,100 shares, less than the daily average
volume of 232,900 shares so far this month and 233,548 shares so
far this year.
   Trading in Philip Morris was 691,800 shares, slightly above the
daily average of 558,790 shares so far this month and 626,242
shares so far this year.

<HEAD>Rales Brothers Increase Interco Bid to $2.84 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In their latest attempt to win over Interco Inc.
shareholders, the Rales brothers sweetened their tender offer for
the furniture and apparel maker to $2.84 billion.
   Through Cardinal Acquisition Corp., the Washington-based sibling
team of Steven and Mitchell Rales on Monday offered $74 a share in
cash for each of Interco's 38.4 million outstanding shares.
   The offer tops the tender offer the duo launched in August by $4
a share, but also represents the fourth time the Rales brothers
have bid for the St. Louis-based company.
   Interco, which rejected the earlier Rales offers and instead
unveiled a restructuring plan, had no immediate comment on the
latest bid, said company spokesman Carter Dunkin.
   The Rales brothers made their first overtures to Interco's
management in July, offering to acquire the company for $64 a
share. In August, the group launched a tender offer at $70 a share,
which Interco immediately rejected.
   On Sept. 20, the brothers again were rebuffed after proposing a
friendly merger at $72-a-share that was conditioned on the company
providing them with certain confidential information.
   The sweetened tender offer was announced shortly before the
close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Interco's stock
closed at $71.50 a share, up $1.62{ but still below Cardinal's
latest offer.
   Cardinal said the offer would remain open until midnight Oct.
31, unless extended. However, last week, a federal appeals court in
Philadelphia ordered the brothers to keep their bid open pending a
further ruling in litigation between Cardinal and Interco over the
tender offer.
   Interco has filed suit against Cardinal, charging it violated
federal regulations by failing to disclose that the investment firm
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was a co-bidder.
   Interco also charged that the proposed takeover violates federal
regulations by being too highly leveraged.
   At the time Interco rejected the Rales group's $72-a-share bid,
the company unveiled a $2.8 billion restructuring and
recapitalization program that Interco said could include a sale of
its Ethan Allen furniture unit and other businesses.
   Interco's other products include Broyhill furniture, London Fog
rainwear and Florsheim and Converse shoes.
   The restructuring also includes payment of a special dividend of
$25 in cash and securities per share.
   Interco Chairman Harvey Saligman said the restructuring plan was
worth $76 a share.
   The Raleses have insisted on a chance to bid on any assets
Interco might put up for sale and warned of ``unfortunate
consequences'' _ possibly legal action or a shareholder proxy fight
_ if they are not consulted before any assets are sold.

<HEAD>Delchamps Files Suit to Block Hostile A&P Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delchamps Inc. executives, saying they won't
be ``beaten, bought or buried,'' filed a lawsuit to halt a hostile
takeover of the Alabama-based grocery chain by A&P.
   The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. has offered $30 a share, or
$210 million for Delchamps, which operates supermarkets in Alabama,
Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. The latest offer marks the
third time in two years that A&P has bid for the company.
   In announcing the suit filed Monday in U.S. District Court at
Mobile, Delchamps Chairman A. F. Delchamps Jr. called the A&P offer
``cheap.''
   The lawsuit accused A&P and others of failing to disclose
potential violations of antitrust laws and failure to reveal an
alleged plan to financially cripple Delchamps even if it fails to
buy the company.
   Delchamps said A&P's motive was to either purchase the firm ``at
a cheap price and proceed with its plan to achieve dominance in the
Gulf Coast retail stores market'' or cause the firm to suffer high
legal bills and induce a leverage buyout that would weaken
Delchamps as a competitor.
   ``A&P has not been able to compete with us effectively in the
marketplace, so it has obviously decided, `If you can't beat them,
buy them or bury them with investment bankers and lawyers.' We
don't intend to be beaten, bought or buried,'' Delchamps said.
   A&P spokesman Michael Rourke could not be reached for comment
Monday.
   Delchamps operates 102 grocery stores and six liquor stores.
A&P, headquartered in Montvale, N.J., is 52 percent owned by the
Tengelmann Group of West Germany.
   A&P made its first offer for Delchamps in October 1986, another
in October 1987 and another this month. Between the first and last
attempts, the offering price has risen from $23 to $30 a share.
   Delchamps' stock was trading at $26.50 a share in the
over-the-counter market Monday afternoon, up 50 cents from Friday,
while A&P's stock was down 37{ cents at $46.62{ a share on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Delchamps had sales of about $700 million last year. A&P had
sales of $9.6 billion in 1987, from its 1,170 stores in this
country and Canada.

   The next president will have to take
major steps to turn around an economy destabilized by an entrenched
budget deficit and policy flaws, say economic advisers of varying
political stripes in a Harvard Business Review report.
   In a set of eight papers, experts from consumer activist Ralph
Nader to Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson offer the next president
economic advice amid a presidential campaign that the magazine says
has produced ``a lot of partisan noisiness'' but little serious
deliberation.
   ``There's a fundamental basic instability in the economic system
right now,'' Harvard Business Review Editor Theodore Levitt said
Monday, summing up the papers.
   The magazine had asked panel members to write memos advising the
next president on a range of economic issues. The 42-page report
will appear in the magazine's November-December issue.
   The underlying conclusion: a fundamental instability in the U.S.
economic system needs to be addressed. Indeed, the federal budget
deficit is so deeply rooted that it won't solve itself in the
normal course of economic events.
   Samuelson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor
emeritus, argues that fear of alienating voters has ``frightened
away all candidates from even discussing vital economic issues.''
   The new president, he says, should spend his first year trying
to reduce the deficit from about 3 percent of the nation's $4
trillion gross national product toward 2 percent, and, ultimately,
by 1992 eliminating all deficit that isn't cyclical.
   A basic structural deficit is one that exists regardless of
prevailing economic conditions, so that public debt rises even
after the nation returns to full employment. Cyclical deficits are
tied to inflation, unemployment and other economic conditions.
   ``When asked how to tame a basic deficit, one might answer
prosaically: `By expenditure cuts and tax increases.''' But
Samuelson says the new president needs to abandon the notion that
the deficit can be reduced by either cutting spending or raising
taxes or a 50-50 combination.
   The experts _ two of whom advise the presidential candidates,
Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George Bush _ offer
detailed advice for increasing capital formation, modernizing the
nation's manufacturing base and overhauling public education.
   ``Tell the American people the truth _ that today's apparent
prosperity is being borrowed from the future, that our children
will be angry and frustrated when they are left with a lower
standard of living,'' advises Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former
counselor for Japan affairs to the Secretary of Commerce.
   Nader, a thorn in the side of big business for 25 years,
surprisingly argues that government can learn from business to
become more efficient, humane, creative and responsive.
   ``(The next president) should break through the legendary Oval
Office cocoon to communicate regularly and directly with federal
workers,'' he says. ``He should visit major departments, mix it up
with the employees, listen to their ideas, stimulate their thinking
and remind them of the importance of their mission.''
   Conservative economist Martin Feldstein, a Bush adviser,
counsels avoiding protectionist policies that some industries may
press for during the long road back to trade balance.
   ``If you accede to these pressures, you would not only hurt
American consumers and weaken the competitiveness of American
industry, but would also risk the start of a protectionist trade
war,'' he writes.
   Xerox Corp. Chairman David T. Kearns cites research showing that
if current demographic and economic trends continue, U.S.
businesses will have to hire a million new workers a year who can't
read, write or count _ at an annual cost to industry of $25 million.
   ``The U.S. government spends more money on agriculture research
than it does on education research. It's no wonder we know more
about pork bellies and soybean futures than we do about our
schools,'' he said.

<HEAD>Trump To Sell St. Moritz to Australian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald J. Trump is selling the St.
Moritz Hotel in Manhattan to Australian billionaire entrepreneur
Alan Bond, winner of the 1983 America's Cup and the world's
fourth-largest brewer.
   Trump and a Bond representative said Monday that the selling
price was $180 million. Trump said he bought the hotel, which sits
near Central Park, for $31 million in 1985.
   Trump said the St. Moritz has made an average yearly profit of
$12.5 million during his ownership.
   Sale of the 775-room elegant hotel comes on the heels of Trump's
agreement last week to buy the Eastern Air Shuttle for $365 million.
   But the developer said in today's New York Times that he was not
selling property to raise cash to buy the shuttle.
   ``I don't want to have two hotels on the same block,'' he
explained. He bought the Plaza Hotel down the street from the St.
Moritz earlier this year.
   Bond representatives said the Australian's company would
continue to operate the St. Moritz, which dates back to 1931, as a
hotel.
   His diversified multinational company, Bond Corporation
Holdings, controls half of the Australian beer market and owns the
Pittsburgh Brewing Co. and G. Heileman in the United States. Bond
also is acquiring a mining company and already has hotels in
Australia and Great Britain.
   Trump, whose net worth was estimated by Forbes magazine last
week at $1 billion, did not own the land the St. Moritz occupies.
The hotel, which includes the well-known attractions of Cafe de la
Paix and Rumpelmayer's soda fountain, has a 230-year lease on the
ground.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will spend $1.26 billion to expand
its plant at Bridgend, south Wales, to produce high technology
engines, the government announced Tuesday.
   Peter Walker, the British Cabinet minister responible for Wales,
said Ford's announcement is the biggest foreign motor industry
investment in Britain and would create thousands of jobs in a high
unemployment area.
   About 60 percent of Ford's Bridgend production would be
exported, improving Britain's balance of payments by as much as
$5.2 billion a year, he said.
   Walker said Ford's decision to invest in south Wales instead of
Valencia, Spain, where the company also has a large existing engine
plant, demonstrated Ford's faith in the Welsh workforce.

<HEAD>State To Hike Withholding Rate On Bonuses</HEAD>

   New York says it will place a higher
wihholding tax on bonuses, commissions and other supplemental wages
to make it harder for those in the financial services industry to
evade taxes.
   The state Department of Taxation and Finance announced Monday
that starting Jan. 1, New York will hike its withholding tax to
7.875 percent from 5 percent on supplemental income sources unless
taxpayers make prior arrangements to have withholding taxes figured
at the same rate as regular wages.
   State Tax Commissioner James Wetzler said the change stems from
a tax department investigation that turned up thousands of tax
evaders at prominent Wall Street brokerages and investment houses,
including employees at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Bear, Stearns &
Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   When arrests were made of some top-level employees of those
businesses in April, former Tax Commissioner Roderick Chu said
state officials were ``numbed and shocked'' at how widespread the
tax cheating had become on Wall Street. At that time, Chu said the
state had found more than 5,700 income tax evaders, including 1,519
people with salaries of more than $50,000 a year.
   The probe revealed that many brokers and investment counselors
were properly paying state income taxes on their regular salaries.
But they were found to be paying the 5 percent withholding tax and
no more on the bonuses, partnership distributions and other
supplemental income they were receiving.
   In many cases, said tax department spokesman Paul Rickard,
non-salary income is far larger than the regular pay the executives
get.
   Rickard said he had no estimate of how much in taxes experts
feel the state is getting cheated out of in that manner.
   According to Wetzler, the changes on bonus and commission
withholding is expected to bring the state about $55 million more
in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1989, and $90 million more in
the fiscal year beginning the next day.
   Tax officials said the state has now matched a list of employees
of 1,100 banks, investment firms and stock brokerages with a list
of people not filing income tax returns. Rickard said 10,000
warning letters will be mailed by the tax department this week to
people the state suspects of not properly filing returns.
   According to the spokesman, the state is continuing the process
of settling accounts with those taxpayers found to be shortchanging
the state this spring.
   He said tax officials are expanding their probe to other fields
where some workers earn big bonuses or commissions, such as real
estate.

<HEAD>Reports Say Icahn Abandoning Eastern Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Carl Icahn has broken off efforts to
acquire ailing Eastern Airlines after failing to structure a deal
that would satisfy the carrier's unions.
   Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., said in an
interview with the Wall Street Journal that ``the talks are over.''
   ``It's unfortunate because a merger with Eastern would have been
very positive for TWA. But what will be will be,'' he said in
today's editions of the newspaper.
   Icahn reportedly notified Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of
Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., on Monday that he was unable to
reach an understanding with Eastern's three unions over the weekend.
   Icahn had been negotiating for more than a week with Lorenzo and
Eastern's pilot and machinist unions, although Icahn never made a
specific acquisition proposal. Last Wednesday, New York developer
Donald Trump agreed to buy the Eastern shuttle for $365 million in
cash.
   Sources told The Associated Press on Monday that the union talks
broke down mainly because Icahn was seeking wage concessions from
the Eastern unions that the union leaders considered too severe.
   Icahn ``got too greedy,'' one union source told the Journal.
   The newspaper also reported that Icahn negotiators became angry
when TWA's machinist union tried to tie its forthcoming contract
negoiations with the talks with Eastern.
   Lorenzo reportedly had given Icahn an exclusive right until the
end of the week to make an offer for Eastern to the Texas Air board
of directors. After that deadline, other interested parties could
come forward with offers.
   Texas Air executives have indicated that money-losing Eastern,
minus its profitable Northeast air shuttle, would be worth around
$1 billion, according to the New York Times.
   In addition to Icahn, other parties that have expressed an
interest in buying the rest of Eastern include TWA President Joseph
Corr, who is a close associate of Icahn, and a group of major
insurance companies, the Times said.

   A French professor whose visit to the
United States during the Depression sparked his interest in
economics today won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
   The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Maurice Allais, 77,
won the award ``for his pioneering contributions to the theory of
markets and efficient utilization of resources.''
   Allais told reporters at his suburban Paris home that the award
was ``mindboggling.''
   ``My motivation when I was young was an idea of being able to
improve the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many of
the problems facing the world,'' he said.
   ``That's what led me into economics. I saw it as a way of
helping people.''
   He was the first French economist to win the coveted award since
it was created in 1968. Americans have dominated the prize, taking
15 of the 25 awards since it was created by the Bank of Sweden.
Five winners were British.
   Allais did his economic research at the Ecole Nationale
Superieure des Mines de Paris, the academy said.
   Although his work is little known outside France, Allais ``is
the most prominent figure in modern economic research in France as
regards basic theory and applications to public-sector planning,''
said the 300-member academy in a statement.
   Jacques Levy, director of the Ecole Nationale des Mines, one of
France's most prestigious institutions of higher education, said
Allais ``was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in
postwar France between 1945 and 1968.''
   Within the world of French economic thought after World War II _
in which leftists and rightists agreed that the state should play a
major role in the economy _ Allais established a place for reliance
on market forces.
   Allais's work provided ``a very strong base for those opposed to
government direction of the economy,'' said Jacques Lautman,
scientific director for human sciences at France's National Center
for Scientific Research.
   Allais' training was as an engineer. But in the 1930s, he
visited the United States during the Depression, seeing factories
idled and people unemployed.
   ``This is what sparked him to consecrate his life to
economics,'' Levy said.
   The academy said Allais' greatest contributions came in the
1940s with his work on market equilibrium and efficiency.
   He published works in 1943 and 1947 detailing his theories,
which provided guidelines for using prices in monopolies and for
public sector planning.
   The son of a cheese store owner, Allais was born in 1911 in
Paris. He is a professor of the Center for Economic Analysis at the
Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines.
   His works include: Frequency, Probability and Chance; The
General Theory of Surplus; and Third World at the Crossroads.
   Allais, who has served in French governments in several
positions and was named an officer of the Legion of Honor in 1977,
also wrote studies on history and physics.
   He graduated at the top of his class from Ecole Polytechnique in
1933 and then attended the Ecole National Superieure des Mines
until 1936.
   Allais joins three drug researchers from the United States and
Britain who became 1988 Nobel laureates on Monday for discoveries
leading to medications for heart disease, AIDS and other deadly
illnesses.
   Robert M. Solow, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
won the economics prize last year for creating a model showing how
technology and other factors influence economic growth.
   The economics prize is a late addition to the five awards
established in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel, who bequeathed his
fortune from the invention of dynamite to reward scientific
breakthroughs, activities for peace, and literature ``of an
idealistic tendency.''
   On Wednesday the prizes in physics and chemistry will be
announced, closing the list of laureates for this year.
   The U.N. peacekeeping forces were awarded the peace prize Sept.
29 by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo. The literature prize
was won by Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz.
   The prizes carry a cash award of 2.5 million kronor, or about
$390,000 at today's exchange rate. The prizes will be distributed
Dec. 10 in Stockholm, except the peace prize which is given the
same day in Oslo.
   On Monday the medicine prize was awarded to Gertrude B. Elion,
70, and George H. Hitchings, 83, for identifying differences in the
processing of genetic materials in normal cells and cancer cells,
protozoa, bacteria and viruses.
   They shared the prize with James W. Black of Great Britain who
discovered beta blockers, the key to developing medicines which
calm the body, control blood pressure and help prevent fatalities
in heart attack victims.

   Manufacturing states, which have lagged behind
the national average in personal income growth during the 1980s,
began to close the gap in the year ended in June, the government
said today.
   The Commerce Department said non-farm personal incomes continued
to grow fastest in the high-tech industrial states of New England
from the second quarter of 1987 to the second quarter of this year,
as they have through most of the current economic expansion.
   From the end of the last recession in the third quarter of 1982
and continuing through the April-June period of last year, incomes
in the coastal regions _ New England, Far West, Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic _ have grown faster than in the regions in the middle
_ Great Lakes, Plains, Southwest and Rocky Mountain area.
   The disparity has led administration critics to dub the current
expansion ``the bicoastal economy.''
   However, in the last year, the mix has begun to change. New
England is still on top but Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic states
dependent on traditional heavy manufacturing are improving and
income growth in the Southeast and Far West has cooled a bit.
   For the United States as a whole, the annual rate of non-farm
personal income growth for the year ended in June was 7.7 percent,
up from 7.1 percent in the earlier part of the economic expansion.
   Here's how the various regions fared:
   New England: 9.5 percent, up from 8.7 percent.
   Mid-Atlantic: 8.7 percent, up from 7.4 percent.
   Far West: 7.8 percent, down from 8.2 percent.
   Great Lakes: 7.7 percent, up from 6.2 percent.
   Southeast: 7.5 percent, down from 7.9 percent.
   Plains: 6.2 percent, up from 5.9 percent.
   Southwest: 5.8 percent, up from 5.5 percent.
   Rocky Mountain: 5.2 percent, up from 5.1 percent.
   The Commerce Department attributed gains in the Great Lakes
states to strength in the manufacturing of durable goods, ``big
ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, and in
construction. It said the Mid-Atlantic region also benefited from a
pickup in manufacturing.
   Growth in the Southeast as a whole was down, but by state it was
mixed. Weak growth in incomes from service jobs in Georgia and
interior states more than offset strong growth in the Atlantic
coast states of Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and South
Carolina.
   Economists have been anticipating gains in the so-called
manufacturing ``Rust Belt'' of the nation. The drop in the value of
the dollar over the last three years has made U.S. goods less
expensive on overseas markets and has fueled a boom in export sales
this year.

10th graf pvs, Macmillan agreed ...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British publisher Robert Maxwell said today he
will appeal a Delaware judge's refusal to overturn a key element in
Macmillan Inc.'s buyout agreement with a rival suitor.
   Maxwell said he also planned to seek an order barring the
consummation of the rival group's tender offer for the publishing
and information services giant.
   Macmillan has agreed to a $2.5 billion buyout by the investment
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Macmillan senior management.
   Maxwell has offered $2.51 billion for Macmillan under certain
conditions, and both sides have tender offers out that are
scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT Wednesday.
   On Monday, Jack B. Jacobs, a judge in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington, Del., denied Maxwell's request for an injunction
against a ``lockup provision'' that Macmillan granted Kohlberg in
case its buyout offer failed.
   The provision gives the Kohlberg group the right to buy four of
Macmillan's businesses for $865 million should the merger fail to
materialize.
   Maxwell, who is making his bid through his Maxwell Communication
Corp., had argued that the provision was unfair and said he would
be willing to pay $900 million for the same units, which include
the Berlitz language centers, the directory division, the direct
marketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes.
   But Macmillan argued that the provision was needed to persuade
the Kohlberg group to raise its bid for the company.
   In today's statement, Maxwell Communication said it ``intends to
appeal the court's decision and will move today in the appropriate
courts for an injunction barring the consummation of KKR's tender
offer and barring Macmillan from entering into any transactions out
of the ordinary course of business pending that appeal.''
   When the company concluded an auction for itself late last
month, Maxwell offered $89 a share in cash for its 27.8 million
shares, while Kohlberg offered $90.05 a share in cash and
securities.
   Macmillan agreed to the Kohlberg offer, but Maxwell subsequently
raised his offer to $90.25 a share in cash.
   Jacobs said in his ruling that while ``the auction procedures
were deficient in several respects ... the evidence is not
sufficient to persuade the court that those infirmities were
responsible in a legal sense for Macmillan not receiving
(Maxwell's) highest bid before the auction gavel fell.''
   The judge did grant Maxwell's request for an injunction against
Macmillan's poison-pill defense, which could have been used to
dilute his stake in the company if he were to begin to accumulate
Macmillan stock.
   The judge said he granted the request on condition that Maxwell
proceed with his offer.
   Among Maxwell's options are to appeal the decision to a higher
court.
   He had conditioned his tender offer on, among other things, the
elimination of both the poison pill provision and the lockup
option. He had argued that if Kohlberg were allowed to buy the four
units, Macmillan would be left with a $250 million tax liability on
the sale.

<HEAD>MCI Earnings Up Nearly Six-Fold in 3rd-Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. said Tuesday its
earnings rose nearly six-fold in the third quarter on a 40.8
percent rise in revenue.
   MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance company, said its
net income rose to a record $99 million, or 38 cents per share, in
the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with $17 million, or 6
cents per share, in 1987.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to a record $1.4 billion for the
quarter, compared with $994 million for the same period last year.
   The company said earnings were driven by strong revenue growth
from sales of 800-line and international services and gains in
commercial accounts as well as improved operating margins.
   ``Our success in increasing both volume and market share while
controlling costs has allowed us to take full advantage of the high
operating leverage that is fundamental to this industry,'' said
Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI president and chief operating officer.
   MCI said the third quarter results included a pre-tax gain of
$11 million from previously negotiated antitrust settlements and a
pre-tax charge of $8 million associated with a contract settlement.
Results for the third quarter of 1987 included a pre-tax gain of $2
million from antitrust settlements.
   The results for this year's quarter also reflected a 7.35
percent dividend on $400 million of preferred stock that was issued
to International Business Machines Corp. in August. MCI also
completed the repurchase of about 47 million shares of common stock
from IBM.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, MCI earnings rose more than
fivefold to $219 million, or 78 cents per share, from $41 million,
or 14 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 27.6 percent to $3.7 billion from $2.9
billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>GM's Pay-for-Performance Plan May Be Scrapped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s pay-for-performance
program for its salaried workers is under review because it
requires a ranking of non-union employees that some workers feel is
unfair, a spokeswoman says.
   Patricia Malloy said Monday a decision on a compensation plan
for salaried employees in 1989 has not been made. But she said the
company is reacting to changes in the program which resulted in
some employee concern that judgments about their performance
weren't fair.
   She said GM has used some form of a pay-for-performance plan for
its salaried employees for years.
   ``The problem with the modifications made last year was not so
much that it distinguished among employees as much as the
perception that some people were judged, in their minds,
unfairly,'' Malloy said.
   The rankings were created to determine how large a raise, if
any, GM's 114,000 salaried employees should receive. But workers
who learned of the rankings began grumbling that such information
should not be widely circulated.

   Grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting concerns about the
rain-slowed harvest and disappointment in the pace of U.S. wheat
exports.
   Soybeans opened a little stronger in reaction to the wet
Midwestern weather that has slowed harvesting and farmer selling of
both soybeans and corn, analysts said.
   ``The corn market is very quiet,'' said Dale Gustafson, an
analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``There
obviously is not much movement and harvesting has been slowed but
the demand side of the market has been slow at the same time.''
   Corn harvesting was 63 percent complete as of Sunday in the top
17 producing states while soybean harvesting was 90 percent
finished in the top 19 producing states, the Agriculture Department
said late Monday.
   Wheat futures prices retreated slightly amid disappointment over
the USDA's rejection of bids from Egypt and China for large
shipments of subsidized soft red wheat. But China did buy 110,000
metric tons of hard red wheat at a subsidized price, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 3\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.27 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to { cent lower with December at $2.94{ a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with December at $2.58 a bushel;
soybeans were unchanged to 2\ cents higher with November at $8.12{
a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent to .62 cent lower with October at
72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .57 cent lower
with October at 81.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent to .42
cent lower with October at 39.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .48 cent to .80 cent lower with February at 48.25 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Monday while pork futures were
mixed.

<TEXT>
   The new governing council of the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange on Tuesday named bank president Lee Quo-wei as it
chairman.
   It also announced the appointment of Francis Yuen as the
exchange's chief executive to succeed Robert Fell, who was
appointed to the post in the aftermath of last October's market
crash.
   Lee, head of Hang Seng Bank Ltd, was one of five nonbrokers
appointed to the 22-member council by the government from outside
the exchange's membership.
   Prior to his appointment, Yuen was managing director of Citicorp
Scrimgeour Vickers Hong Kong Ltd.
   The appointments completed a shakeup of the exchange's
management, transforming the council from a virtual private club of
local brokers into a more broadly representative body.
   The chanmges followed criticism of the closure of the market
during last October's global crash and a bribery scandal that has
resulted in the arrest of eight former exchange officials.
   Four seats in the new council are reserved for individual
members; four for officers of corporate brokerages; five for
independent representatives of the public, the investment community
and listed companies; and one for the chief executive. The
remaining seats are open to any members.
   Previously, the exchange was run by a 21-member general
committee comprised of individual brokers.

   Pillsbury Co.'s board of directors urged
stockholders today to reject Grand Metropolitan PLC's unsolicited
$5.23 billion bid for the food and restaurant company.
   The board described the $60-a-share offer as inadequate.
   Pillsbury said its board instructed management to work with the
company's financial and legal advisers to consider alternative
courses that would boost the price of the company's stock and
protect the best interests of the company and its shareholders.
   The company's stock was unchanged at $58.62{ a share in midday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Walter Montgomery, a spokesman for Grand Met, said the British
conglomerate had no immediate response to today's action by
Pillsbury board.
   In a letter sent to all Pillsbury shareholders, Philip L. Smith,
chairman and chief executive officer of Pillsbury, said, ``The
board believes that shareholders would realize greater value by
retaining their stake in Pillsbury.''
   ``Now is not an appropriate time to sell the company. Remaining
independent would be a superior alternative over the long term to
accepting the Grand Met offer,'' Smith added.
   At a news conference today, Smith said Pillsbury's options could
include selling the company to a third party, restructuring
Pillsbury's finances by selling some businesses or going ahead with
a leveraged buyout.
   He said Pillsbury will give shareholders a better idea of the
company's strategy before the deadline for tendering stock to Grand
Met expires.
   ``The offer made by Grand Met, $60 a share, is not adequate,''
Smith said. ``Greater values are available to the shareholder in
the long term.''
   Asked what he thought Pillsbury's chances were in defending
against a takeover bid by a well-heeled suitor, Smith said, ``It
ain't over 'til it's over.''
   Wall Street analysts had speculated Monday that Pillsbury would
reject Grand Metropolitan's offer, which was made Oct. 4, and
possibly announce a dividend-yielding restructuring in an effort to
remain independent or possibly attract a better offer from Grand
Metropolitan.
   There also was speculation that a European ``white knight,''
possibly Britain's Unilever PLC, might emerge as a friendly merger
partner.
   But Smith said Pillsbury was not currently up for sale and that
``remaining independent would be a superior alternative over the
long term to accepting the Grand Met offer.''
   In his letter to shareholders, Smith said, ``The board found
that Grand Met's offer failed to reflect the values currently being
developed at Pillsbury and its subsidiaries under programs that are
in the process of being implemented.''
   Those programs include ``reinvesting'' in the company's core
businesses, he said.
   Pillsbury is a diversified international food company with
operations in packaged consumer foods, including Green Giant and
Haagen Dazs products, and restaurants.
   Among its restuarants are Burger King, Steak and Ale and
Bennigan's.
   The Grand Met bid is one of two takeover attempts in among
giants in the food industry that are currently under way. On
Monday, Philip Morris Cos. announced a $11 billion bid for Kraft
Inc. that would make it the world's largest maker of consumer
goods. Like Pillsbury, Kraft indicated it might fight the takeover.

   The stock market was mostly lower in moderate
trading at midday today, as an early rally fueled by takeover
activity in the food industry ran out of steam.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.80 points at
2,135.67 at noon EDT.
   Declining stocks were slightly ahead of advancing ones, with 634
issues lower, 614 higher and 550 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 78.48 million shares, up sharply
from 57.66 million traded by the same time on Monday.
   Analysts said most of the action centered around issues of major
food companies involved in new takeover bids.
   ``The rest of the market is still on hold,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Market watchers also noted some underlying uneasiness in advance
of Wednesday's one-year anniversary of the October stock market
collapse.
   Kraft stock had shot up 28] a share to 88{ in heavy trading,
just below the $90 a share offered late Monday by Philip Morris in
an $11 billion takeover offer. Philip Morris stock had dropped 5[
to 94~, apparently because investors felt the acquisition would
dilute the earnings of the cigarette and food giant.
   Philip Morris said it has filed suit against Kraft and certain
of its directors in an Illinois court.
   In another major development in the food industry, Pillsbury was
unchanged at 58|, after an earlier decline. Pillsbury said its
board of directors unanimously rejected a $60-a-share tender offer
from Grand Metropolitan of Britain.
   Among other blue-chip issues, Warner Lambert had fallen 4[ to
72|, Gillette was up { at 34], IBM had advanced 1 to 122[ and
General Electric had gained [ at 44.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.26 at 156.13.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had edged
up 0.06 to 303.33.

   PPG Industries Inc. said Tuesday its
third-quarter profit climbed 24 percent from a year ago as its
glass, chemicals and coating and resins businesses each showed
improvement.
   The company reported earnings of $112.9 million, or $1.03 per

million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 8 percent to $1.36 billion from $1.26

   For the first nine months, the company earned $365.3 million, or
$3.32 per share, up 30 percent from $280.6 million, or $2.34 per
share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 9 percent to $4.19 billion from $3.86
billion a year earlier.
   ``All of PPG's major business segments _ glass, coatings and
resins, and chemicals _ registered sales and operating earnings
growth for both the quarter and nine-month period,'' said Chairman
Vincent A. Sarni.
   He said the company expects to achieve record sales, earnings
and return on equity for the year.

<HEAD>Health Maintenance Group Mergers Microcosm Of National Trend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRETT J. BLACKLEDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Midwestern city, once recognized
nationally for the swift emergence of health maintenance
organizations, is now at the center of an industrywide shakeout.
   The merger of four Tulsa health care plans within a few months
represents a growing national trend of consolidation among HMOs.
   ``It sounds like a western, but this town's not big enough for
more plans,'' said Dr. C.B. Rebsamen of PruCare of Tulsa, one of
three surviving health maintenance plans left in a city that once
offered more than 20.
   ``I think what's happening in Tulsa is an example of what the
rest of the country is experiencing,'' said Rebsamen, who is head
of the doctor group for PruCare. ``We seem to be experiencing the
end of the boost in the industry.''
   HMOs, which emerged earlier this decade as an alternative to
traditional health insurance, are prepaid plans of health services
that include preventive treatment.
   The plans, buoyed by federal legislation requiring many
employers to provide HMOs as an option to employees, offer health
services through physician groups controlled by HMO units,
independent groups or private physicians who agree to participate.
   Industry observers say the large number of insolvencies and
repeated annual losses for HMOs are due to the rapid expansion in
the industry, rising benefit costs, undercapitalization,
mismanagement and tough competition.
   ``What they're suffering most from is shortsightedness and
stupidity,'' said Peter Boland, president of Boland Healthcare
Consultants in Berkeley, Calif., a national consulting firm for
managed health plans.
   As much as two-thirds of all HMOs nationally reported losses in
1987, more than any other previous year, Boland said.
   HMOs have faced the added pressure of the evolution of preferred
provider organizations, or PPOs, another three-letter plan that in
many cases offers customers more flexibility, choice and
accessibility than the traditional HMO, Boland said.
   The combined effect of financial instability and viable
competition in the market made initial early growth for HMOs a
short-lived phenomenon, he said.
   ``It really flew in the face of dynamics that are coming back to
haunt them,'' Boland said.
   BlueLincs HMO in Tulsa, a Blue Cross and Blue Shield group,
acquired HMO of Oklahoma, Health Accord of Oklahoma and Aetna
Choice Healthcare Plan _ all within four months.
   ``A unification of four HMOs in less than 120 days is
unprecedented in this industry,'' said Tom Bowser, executive vice
president of BlueLincs, when announcing the last acquisition this
past summer.
   The Tulsa mergers were not included in the most recent national
quarterly report issued by InterStudy, a non-profit research group
based in Excelsior, Minn., that studies the health maintenance
industry. But the activity has not gone unnoticed, said senior
InterStudy researcher Judith Hale.
   ``There's certainly a trend toward consolidation nationally,''
Ms. Hale said. You're either going to have to grow or you're going
to have to go with a larger plan.''
   In 1985, Tulsa began to be recognized by health care experts as
an example of the growth and expansion of HMOs across the country.
In that year, 11 plans were offered in the city of 380,000.
   ``Few medical markets outside California and Minneapolis are as
highly competitive, and it's doubtful any became so as fast,''
wrote Larry Frederick, senior associate editor of Medical
Economics, in the May 1985 issue of the national health industry
magazine.
   In 1985, there were 480 HMO plans nationwide with 21 million
members. The number of plans and participants had grown steadily
since 1981, with the largest increase in plans and enrollment in
1985.
   ``We set up a situation where it was pretty easy to get into the
HMO business,'' Ms. Hale said. ``But it's not very easy to stay in.
It's a tough business.''
   ``HMOs that succeed will have excellent management, will be
diversified, and may or may not be legally constituted as HMOs,''
she states in a report on the future of the industry.
   With the termination of Physicians Health Plan of Oklahoma, only
three plans remain in Tulsa, serving nearly 90,000 clients.
   Nationally, 15 health plans (not including those merged in
Tulsa) were terminated, merged or acquired by another group in the
first quarter of 1988, according to InterStudy.
   Ms. Hale said national studies indicate a decrease in growth in
the HMO industry with fewer new plans started and a drop in
enrollment growth. Last year was the first year since 1981 that
enrollment did not increase from the previous year, and the first
quarter of 1988 shows a decrease in the number of plans, according
to InterStudy's statistics.
   As of March, there were 648 HMOs in the country serving 31
million members, an increase of 1.7 million clients since the
previous quarter, Ms. Hale said. The growth seemed to peak in June
1987 with 662 plans serving just under 29 million members, she said.
   ``There's no question that the growth rate is slowing. But it's
hardly a dying industry when you see 1.7 million new members,'' she
said. ``What we see now is the number of new plans is balanced with
the number of merged plans.''

<HEAD>Bahrain Hopes Stock Exchange Will Be Gulf's Wall Street</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NABILA MEGALLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bahrain is to have its first stock
exchange by the end of the year and officials hope it will become
the Wall Street of the oil-rich gulf region.
   Initially, 28 Bahraini companies will be listed for trading,
with an aggregate capital of about $1.8 billion.
   Efforts are under way to attract business from neighboring Arab
countries as a new commercial confidence in the gulf emerges in the
region with the cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   The first stage will be limited to regulating and channeling
existing share dealings, mainly person-to-person, in Bahrain.
   Officials said the regulations are still being formulated. But
they noted that the financial records of all companies will be
scrutinized and the exchange's board of directors will regularly
review ceilings for share movements.
   Despite the low-key beginning, businessmen believe it won't be
long before the small chamber at the end of Manama's main banking
street flourishes into a bustling bourse in a region that sits on
one-third of the world's oil reserves.
   There is no fixed timetable for developing the exchange, which
officials hope will become the financial nerve center of the
region. Bahraini, gulf and international listings will be added
over the next five to 10 years.
   The man tapped to be its director general is banking on an even
faster pace.
   ``Ten years is a long time ... We hope to have that status
before then. Hopefully we can be recognized internationally before
long,'' said Fawzi Behzad, adviser to the nine-member board.
   He holds a doctorate from the International University of San
Diego, Calif., earned in 1984 with a thesis entitled ``Prototype
for the Bahrain Stock Market.''
   Although the scale of gulf investment in the new exchange is not
yet clear, Bahraini financier Ali Saleh cited some key advantages.
   ``I believe the gulf is a prime region for investors _ no taxes,
no exchange problems,'' he said.
   Behzad noted that the British government's order to Kuwait to
reduce its holdings in the British Petroleum Co. was a timely
reminder to gulf investors to look to their own region rather than
abroad.
   ``The scope for investment aboard is subject to the laws of
those countries ... Crises and annoyances on the world market are
no doubt positive elements in enhancing chances of capital rushing
back to the domestic market,'' he said.
   Gulf states have invested billions of petrodollars harvested
from the 1970s oil boom abroad. Strapped by the collapse of oil
prices, gulf governments want national stock exchanges and
eventually a regional capital market to attract back billions of
dollars held overseas by the private sector.
   Luring that money back may not be so easy, considering the
recent track record for equity markets in the region. Six years
ago, Kuwait's unofficial Souk al-Manakh stock market crashed under
the weight of $94 billion of post-dated ``paper checks.'' Many
investors were badly hurt.
   Abdulnabi al-Sho'ala, a leading businessman and member of the
board of Bahrain's Chamber of Commerce, said the Kuwait crash was
part of a ``chain reaction'' to the recession that has gripped the
region since the Iran-Iraq war broke out in September 1980.
   The recession was fueled by a downturn in oil prices that began
in 1982, the fluctuating dollar and a general stock market slump.
   ``Building people's confidence isn't easy. Lots of people
suffered through dealing in shares,'' Sho'ala said.
   With dozens of offshore banks and financial institutions, and
traditionally the region's services center, Bahrain sees itself as
the natural financial heart of the gulf.
   Kuwait, recovering from al-Manakh, is fast developing its infant
official exchange. Oman plans a small market this year, and the
United Arab Emirates says its turn will come soon.
   Saudi Arabia is cautiously fostering a dealings center and
encouraging public issues by major firms.
   Bahrain is linked to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the
United Arab Emirates through the Gulf Cooperation Council, an
economic and defense alliance.
   Economist Henry Azzam, vice president of the Gulf International
Bank, has estimated that there is some $150 billion of gulf money
invested abroad, against $50 billion in the GCC.
   The Gulf Investment Authority, owned by the GCC governments,
said in a recent study that ``a collective GCC stock market will
polarize $320 billion in GCC petrodollars estimated to have been
invested abroad.''
   During the oil boom, when there was so much money around, there
was no need to mobilize liquidity. But in the early 1980s,
governments started suffering shortages of capital and sought to
beef up non-oil revenue.
   Financiers stressed the need to broaden Bahrain's capital market
and to integrate with the GCC. In theory, GCC nationals can already
buy up to 25 percent of shares in a GCC company elsewhere, but some
governments have acted to restrict that. Kuwait, for example, bans
non-citizens holding stakes in its banks.
   ``Every (GCC) government has been talking about a larger role
for the private sector. If they want the savings in private hands,
they have to open channels for them,'' said Azzam.

<TEXT>
   Chevron Co. USA says it plans to drill
an exploratory oil and gas well this winter from an ice island in
the Beaufort Sea.
   Construction of the island and an ice road connecting it to
shore is expected to begin in mid-December, a U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers permit application said.
   Tom Cook, Chevron's exploration manager, said Monday that
drilling of the Karluk prospect would be finished by May 1 to allow
removal of all equipment before breakup.
   The prospect is about eight miles east of the Endicott oil field
operated by the Standard Alaska Production Co. It is inside the
barrier islands, on a state lease Chevron acquired in 1979 in the
joint state-federal Beaufort Sea lease sale.
   Chevron has been interested in the area for quite awhile, Cook
said. He said the company drilled a well on Jeanette Island, about
four mile north of the new prospect, several years ago.
   The well will be Chevron's first since 1986, when it teamed with
Standard on the only well drilled to date in the coastal plain of
the nearby Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Cook said there is no
particular reason the company has planned the well for this winter,
other than that it is a prospect Chevron identified some time ago.
   State oil and gas officials said the 10-year lease on the
prospect is about to expire and speculated that might be Chevron's
primary reason for drilling this year.
   The company is planning an ice island that is about 1,000 feet
in diameter and about 50 feet thick.

   Jeffrey Dudas began a stockbroker training program with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. on Oct. 19, 1987, the day
infamously recalled as Black Monday, when the Dow Jones industrial
average plummeted 508 points.
   What's worse, Dudas began practicing his new profession on Nov.
13, a Friday.
   Foreboding signs and the hard reality of the crash aside, Dudas,
like some of the brokers who have made their debuts within the last
year, has used the crash to his advantage.
   Dudas, 29, a former Navy pilot, said prospective clients were
initially hesitant to commit to a new broker in the wake of the
crash, but were anxious to talk.
   ``I have people who have had brokers for years and are dealing
with me and one of the things they know is ... that their brokers
didn't call them Oct. 19 or the weeks following,'' said Dudas, who
works at Prudential-Bache's office in Virginia Beach, Va.
   A number of those brokers, even some who did call their clients
on the day of the crash, might now be unemployed or in another line
of work. Over 12,000 workers in the securities business _ including
brokers, floor traders, clerks and secretaries _ lost jobs as a
result of the crash of a year ago, according to some estimates.
   A survey by the North American Securities Administrators
Administration, a state regulatory agency, shows approximately two
out of three investors say their problems stemming from the crash
have not been resolved. John Baldwin, NASAA's president, said the
survey indicated one out of seven small investors said they have
left the market completely or were holding less than $500 in stocks.
   Once known for their ability to grab new customers with a daily
round of cold calls, young brokers joining the fold since the crash
seem to be working harder than ever at getting to know their
clients.
   Jim Chin, a broker for Shearson Lehman-Hutton in New York since
late 1987, said good brokering is not purely transactional.
   ``You're not just calling a person and saying, `Look, I have
this great stock. You ought to buy it,' and you don't know anything
about the person.''
   Chin, 42, meets with his clients a few times before deciding
where to distribute their investments.
   Recently, a client asked Chin to invest his $1 million portfolio
in equities. Realizing his expertise at that point was limited,
Chin gave part of the responsibility and commission to other
Shearson money managers whose performance he monitors.
   ``It's not a matter of maxing out commissions, but doing the
right thing for the client,'' Chin said.
   Abbe Spector, a 25-year-old financial consultant for Merrill
Lynch & Co. Inc. in New York, compares the role of the post-crash
broker to that of a physician.
   ``You can't just walk into a doctor's office and be prescribed a
medicine,'' Spector said. ``You have to get to know the history and
then start making recommendations.''
   Partly in response to the bottom falling out last year, Spector
made the transition from municipal bond seller to full-service
broker.
   During the bull market people were eager to hear a stock idea
right off the bat, Spector said. But since the crash, ``people
adjusted their thinking and want to talk about our overall ideas,''
she said.
   Merrill Lynch has taken the consultative approach for years,
according to Spector, but now the clients have come to expect it.
   When Spector is convinced that a person she has cold-called is
already under good financial care by another broker, she usually
does not try to pursue the business.
   But many new brokers find that success is still based on a
numbers game. Shearson's Chin works a 55-hour week and recently
broke the 200 mark in his clientele.
   New brokers are required to attain 40 new clients with
investments of at least $10,000 each in their first six months,
according to Chin. ``I blew it away,'' Chin said of the minimum.
   The company sounds just as ambitious about the future of the
brokering business. Spokesman Michael O'Neill said Shearson
enrolled 900 in its training program for 1988, up slightly from 853
in 1987.
   ``We have a long-term commitment to retail investors, even
though individual investment is down this year,'' he said.
   For Prudential-Bache's Dudas, the challenge lies in holding on
to new business.
   Nothing can compete with landing aboard a jet carrier at night,
the ex-aviator said reflectively, but ``I've lost more sleep for my
clients than I ever did after I came back from a bad landing in the
Navy.''

<HEAD>Brewer's Message In a Bottle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scottish & Newcastle Breweries PLC said Tuesday it
will paste its labels upside down on 36 million bottles of its
Newcastle Brown Ale to protest an Australian takeover bid.
   A special ``hands off'' message _ yet to be written _ will be
pasted onto the back of 24 million of those bottles, brewery
spokesman Jim Merrington said. ``We sell Newcastle Brown to 30
different countries so we expect this message will soon find its
way to Australia,'' said Merrington, head of the brewery's public
affairs department.
   Australian brewing company Elders IXL Ltd. launched a takeover
bid Monday for the Scottish-based beverage company, valuing it at
$2.8 billion.
   Scottish & Newcastle promptly rejected the offer, calling it
``totally unwelcome and unacceptable.''
   Merrington said, ``The aim of the upside down labels is to
demonstrate a thumbs down to Elders.''
   Three million of the bottles will be distributed nationally by
the end of the week and another nine million by the end of the
month, he said.
   Merrington said the takeover proposal should be referred to the
government's Monopolies and Merger Commission.
   He noted that S&N's profit of $197 million in its latest fiscal
year was up 25 percent over the previous year. The company employs
24,000 workers.
   Scottish & Newcastle rejected a merger proposal from Elders last
summer.
   Elders, through its Courage Holdings PLC subsidiary, is offering
$6.96 a share in cash for Scottish brewery.
   The Australian company, which makes the popular Fosters brand
lager, already owns 9.65 percent of Scottish & Newcastle's stock.

   Share prices closed slightly lower Tuesday in
active trading on the London stock exchange.
   Analysts said although the market has shown recent resilience,
chances for further advances appeared to be limited as the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index approached its
post-crash high of 1892.2.
   The FT-SE 100-share index fell 3.0 points, or 0.02 percent, to
1857.0, its lowest point of the day. The index rose as much as 3.8
points early in the afternoon, only to drop back in late trading.
   By the close of the day, the narrower Financial Times 30-share
index was off 1.4 points at 1509.5.
   The more broadly based Financial Times 500-share index was down
0.56 points at 1052.11.
   Overall volume was 561.8 million shares, compared with the 459.8
million traded Monday.
   Dealers said there was some disappointment over the lack of
leadership emerging from Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was off 4.09 points at 2,136.38 by the close of

   Occidental Petroleum Co. was ordered Tuesday
to sell Tenneco Polymers Inc., after an administrative law judge
ruled that the 1986 acquisition of the company reduced competition
in the production of materials needed to make plastics.
   The ruling by Judge Thomas F. Howder upheld a 1986 complaint by
the Federal Trade Commission, which had challenged Occidental's $70
million takeover of the polymer company.
   The acquisition substantially reduced competition in the
production of three types of polyvinyl chloride resin, Howder
concluded.
   The judge ordered Occidental to divest Tenneco Polymers within
12 months to a buyer that the commission must approve.

<HEAD>Hercules Introduces New Packaging Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hercules Inc. on Tuesday introduced a new
film-packaging technology that it claimed will double the shelf
life of fresh produce.
   Hercules said its new ``FreshHold'' package system controls the
atmosphere inside packages, thereby keeping produce fresh longer
and preserving its appearance, taste and color.
   Hercules, a chemical and aerospace company based in Wilmington,
Del., said it took five years to develop the packaging.
   ``The key element is a breathable film that allows fresh produce
to continue breathing after packing,'' James E. Knox, president of
Hercules Engineered Polymers Co., told a news conference. ``This
breathable film regulates the rate at which oxygen and carbon
dioxide enter and leave the package.''
   An initial venture involving broccoli has been successful, Knox
said.
   FreshHold packaging has been test-marketed at supermarkets in
Richmond, Va.; Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and
Dallas.
   Cauliflower, strawberries, celery, carrots, lettuce and
pineapple will be available with the new packaging next year, the
company said.
   While packaged produce now makes up only 3 percent of the
billion-dollar U.S. produce market, many companies are working on
similar concepts to extend shelf life, experts say. The new product
also will reduce the amount of ice needed to transport produce
across the country.
   The FreshHold packaging also has some drawbacks, according to
experts. The lunglike membrane on top of the film has to be custom
designed to the respiration rate of each type of produce held in
the box, and it requires good refrigeration for optimum performance.
   In addition, consumers must be convinced that pre-cut fruits and
vegetables are as fresh as those they can choose themselves from
the produce bin, the experts say. The produce packaged in FreshHold
sells for slightly more than unpackaged fruits and vegetables.

   The output of crude steel by producers
in the non-Communist world rose 8.7 percent in September to 39.549
million metric tons from 36.384 million tons a year earlier, the
International Iron and Steel Institute said Tuesday.
   The European Economic Community registered the sharpest increase
with output rising 12.7 percent to 11.672 million tons in September
from 10.36 million tons in the year-earlier month.
   Japan's production rose in the same time period by 7.8 percent
to 8.638 million tons from 8.01 million tons while U.S. production
climbed 7.4 percent to 7.5 million tons from 6.98 million tons.
   For the first nine months of 1988, the output of crude steel by
the non-Communist nations rose 10.6 percent to 351.368 million tons
from 317.59 million tons in the year-earlier period.
   Steel producers in the institute's monthly survey come from 32
countries and account for 59 percent of 1987 world production and
for 97 percent of world output excluding the Soviet Union and other
countries in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance as well as
China and North Korea.

<TEXT>
   Maurice Allais, a prolific theorist
whose ideas on balancing supply and demand helped rebuild the
French economy after World War II, won the Nobel Prize for
economics Tuesday.
   Allais, a Paris shopkeeper's son, became mentor to a generation
of economists. He developed formulas to enable large enterprises,
particularly public ones, to keep an economy in balance by
regulating prices and allocating their resources.
   After the award was announced, the 77-year-old economist said he
had given up hope of ever winning the prize, which was established
20 years ago. ``I've been mentioned so many times before, I just
didn't think I would get it,'' he said at from apartment in a Paris
suburb.
   The poverty and unemployment Allais saw in the United States, on
a visit during the Great Depression of the 1930s, turned him to
economics from the engineering career for which he had trained.
   ``He is a giant in economic theoretic analysis,'' said Assar
Lindbeck, who heads the committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences that awards the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
   ``He's been under consideration for a long time,'' Lindbeck
said. ``It took a long time to investigate him because of the great
volume and complexity of his works.''
   According to the citation, Allais was honored ``for his
pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient
utilization of resources.''
   This year's prizes are worth about $390,000. Allais is the first
French national to win the economics award, according to the
official list, but 1983 laureate Gerard Debreu of the United States
was born in Calais. He was a student of Allais.
   Allais did his major work in Nazi-occupied France during the
war. He published ``In Search of an Economic Discipline'' in 1943
and ``Economy and Interest'' in 1947.
   Of his change in careers, the laureate said Tuesday: ``My
motivation when I was young was an idea of being able to improve
the conditions of life, to try to find a remedy to many of the
problems facing the world. That's what led me into economics. I saw
it as a way of helping people.''
   Jacques Levy, director of the Ecole Nationale de Mines, said:
``He was the mentor for everyone involved in the economy in postwar
France between 1945 and 1968, all the people who were in charge of
the biggest enterprises and of the state planning apparatus.''
   Allais taught at Levy's institution until his retirement nine
years ago, and is not widely known outside France. He has continued
research and writing.
   His theories are expressed in complicated mathematical formulas.
They form the basis for sorting out the thousands of independent
factors involved in marketing goods and services: How much should a
train ticket cost, for example, or what is the right price for a
kilowatt-hour of electricity?
   Levy said the idea is to keep supply and demand in balance, and
according to the Allais theories, ``it's the government's role to
organize this fair competition.''
   The academy said the French economist's work, in some ways,
parallels that of earlier Nobel laureates Paul Samuelson of the
United States and Sir John Hicks of Britain
   Allais says he is not from any mold.
   ``If you will permit me, I don't fit into any category except my
own,'' he declared Tuesday. ``I am not a monetarist and I am not a
Keynesian. On certain points I agree with each.''
   Samuelson was once quoted as saying a generation of economic
theory would have taken a different course if Allais' earliest
writings had been in English.
   Americans have dominated the prize. Fifteen Americans are among
the 25 economics laureates and five are British.
   Allais has published constantly since the war and has at least
36 titles to his credit, including works on history and physics. He
is an officer of France's Legion of Honor.
   In 1959 he experimented with a pendulum of his own invention,
conducting 220,000 tests to demonstrate that Earth's gravity is
neither constant nor always oriented in the same direction.
   ``He has a vitality which seems to continue all his life,'' said
Tord Ganelius, secretary-general of the economics prize committee.
   U.N. peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize, announced
Sept. 29 in Oslo, Norway, and the award in literature went to
Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz, the first Arabic-language writer
to win it.
   On Monday, American researchers Gertrude B. Elion and George H.
Hitchings shared the medicine award with Sir James W. Black of
Britain for helping develop drugs for use against leukemia, high
blood pressure, AIDS and other diseases.
   Prize winners in chemistry and physics prizes will be announced
Wednesday.
   Economics is the only one of the six Nobel prizes not stipulated
in the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of
dynamite, who died in 1896.
   It was established by the Bank of Sweden and first awarded in
1969. The other prizes have been given since 1901.

   The stock market was mixed in late trading
today, after seesawing gently through much of the trading session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 3.02 points at
2,137.45 at 3 p.m. EDT. The closely watched barometer was dragged
down by a steep decline in Philip Morris stock, one of its
components, and analysts said the average would otherwise have been
higher.
   In the broader market, advancing issues almost evenly matched
declining ones, with 674 issues higher, 672 lower and 575 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 125.78 million shares.
   Analysts said most of the action continued to center around
issues of major food companies involved in new takeover bids.
   ``Other than that, the market's been mixed,'' said Peter
Vandenberg, a trader for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Market watchers also noted some underlying uneasiness in advance
of Wednesday's one-year anniversary of the October stock market
collapse.
   Kraft stock had shot up 28\ a share to 88] in heavy trading,
just below the $90 a share offered late Monday by Philip Morris in
an $11 billion takeover offer. Philip Morris stock had dropped 5{
to 94{, apparently because investors felt the acquisition would
dilute the earnings of the cigarette and food giant.
   Philip Morris said it has filed suit against Kraft and certain
of its directors in an Illinois court.
   In another major development in the food industry, Pillsbury was
up ] at 59, after an earlier decline. Pillsbury said its board of
directors unanimously rejected a $60-a-share tender offer from
Grand Metropolitan of Britain.
   Pillsbury later disclosed that it had filed a suit against Grand
Met and Wendell Investments Ltd. for violations of the Shipping Act
of 1916.
   Among other blue-chip issues, IBM had jumped 2 to 123[, Citicorp

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting the weak tone of
the grain export business.
   Soybeans swung in a range from $8.04 to $8.16 a bushel. The
market opened higher in response to the wet weather that has slowed
corn and soybean harvesting in the Midwest, then sold off on the
lack of strong overseas demand for U.S. soybeans, said Cathy Leow,
a grain-market analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New
York.
   Corn finished mostly lower while wheat was down moderately on
liquidation linked to the continuing disappointment over the lack
of a new long-term Soviet agreement to buy grain from the United
States, Ms. Leow said.
   ``It does not look like we're going to get an agreement prior to
the (presidential) election,'' she said.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 7} cents lower with the

oats were 1 cent lower to 2\ cents higher with December at $2.57 a

<TEXT>
   A group of companies allied with American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. raised the stakes Tuesday in a battle
with other computer giants over control of Unix, a base layer of
software that makes it easier for different brands of computers to
work together.
   By banding together, the big computer makers gained more
bargaining power in the contest with the Open Software Foundation,
a group that includes International Business Machines Corp.,
Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Unix is portrayed by enthusiasts as a great hope of the computer
industry because it would allow programs to run on a wide variety
of computers without expensive alteration.
   However, the struggle over Unix has soured computer buyers, who
fear the standard is being split in two. Programs written to work
with one version of Unix might not run on computers that use
another version.
   Both sides in the contest say they want to unify Unix, but the
AT&T group insists that AT&T's Unix System V Release 4.0 should
serve as the basis, while the Open Software Foundation says IBM's
version, AIX, should be the core.
   The AT&T alliance scored a small victory when the Open Software
Foundation indicated Tuesday that there might be room for
compromise. Until now it has made its insistence on IBM's AIX a
non-negotiable point.
   ``Nothing has changed on that right now,'' Open Software
Foundation spokesman Gary McCormack said. ``But that doesn't mean
the world can't change tomorrow. Please bear with us.''
   A meeting between AT&T and the Open Software Foundation was
scheduled for later in the week, probably Friday, McCormack said.
   The new group rallying around AT&T's version of Unix is made up
of 18 companies, including giants such as Unisys Corp., NCR Corp.,
Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. and Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. SpA.
   The Open Software Foundation was created earlier this year
because of concerns that AT&T was manipulating Unix so it would be
best suited to run on its own computers and those of its
fast-growing Silicon Valley partner, Sun Microsystems Inc.
   But supporters of AT&T's version of Unix, known as System V
Release 4.0, say AT&T has taken steps to ensure that other
companies and customers have a big say in the development of Unix.
   ``What AT&T has done is resolve those issues,'' Jan Lindelow,
senior vice president for marketing and services at Unisys, said in
an interview.
   Among the other companies that have joined the new group are
Amdahl Corp., Control Data Corp., Gould Inc., Intel Corp., Motorola
Inc., Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. SpA, Prime Computer Inc. and
Japan's Toshiba Corp.
   Intel and two smaller companies are members of both groups. ``We
don't play favorites,'' said Kevin Teixeira, an Intel spokesman.

<HEAD>Union Leaders Still Hopeful On Buyer</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines labor officials said Tuesday they
are hopeful there will be other suitors for the carrier, from which
financier Carl Icahn has reportedly backed away.
   ``We'll just keep moving along,'' said Charles E. Bryan,
president of the Machinists District 100, said before leaving
Tuesday for out-of-town meetings concerning Eastern. ``We're
confident that we will still get something worked out.''
   Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., said in an
interview with the Wall Street Journal that ``the talks are over.''
   ``It's unfortunate because a merger with Eastern would have been
very positive for TWA. But what will be will be,'' Icahn was quoted
in Tuesday's editions.
   Icahn reportedly notified Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of
Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., on Monday that he was unable to
reach an understanding with Eastern's three unions over the weekend.
   But with Eastern continuing to lose money and Lorenzo stalemated
in efforts to extract concessions from its unions, Wall Street
analysts and Eastern labor officials think he wants to sell.
   ``I don't think there's any question that his advisers and
lenders have advised him that his crusade against labor is going to
drag the whole Texas Air Corp. down the tubes,'' said Ron Cole, a
spokesman for Eastern's Air Line Pilots Association local. ``I
think he has realized the only way out is to sell.''
   However, The Miami Herald, quoting an unidentified source, said
Tuesday there were no other active offers for Eastern and that
Lorenzo is planning to keep the airline.
   Icahn had been negotiating for more than a week with Lorenzo and
Eastern's pilot and machinist unions, although Icahn never made a
specific acquisition proposal. Last Wednesday, New York developer
Donald Trump agreed to buy the Eastern shuttle for $365 million in
cash.
   Sources told The Associated Press on Monday that the union talks
broke down mainly because Icahn was seeking wage concessions from
the Eastern unions that the union leaders considered too severe.
   Icahn ``got too greedy,'' one union source told the Journal.
   The newspaper also reported that Icahn negotiators became angry
when TWA's Machinists union tried to tie its forthcoming contract
negoiations with the talks with Eastern.
   Lorenzo reportedly had given Icahn an exclusive right until the
end of the week to make an offer for Eastern to the Texas Air board
of directors. After that deadline, other interested parties could
come forward with offers.
   Texas Air executives have indicated that money-losing Eastern,
minus its Northeast shuttle, would be worth about $1 billion,
according to the New York Times.
   In addition to Icahn, other parties that have expressed an
interest in buying the rest of Eastern include TWA President Joseph
Corr, who is a close associate of Icahn, and a group of major
insurance companies, the Times said.
   Eastern has racked up losses of more than $302.5 million since
1987.
   Meanwhile, Eastern announced on Monday an unusual peak-season
cut in MaxSaver fares between Florida and northeast cities.
   ``Never before has Eastern offered such deep discounts so far
ahead of the peak winter travel season,'' said George Brennan,
Eastern's newly named vice president for marketing.
   Fares will range from $69 one way to $89 depending on
destination. Fares between Florida and New York, for example, are
$79 each way. That's 33 percent off the normal restricted MaxSavers
fares and 70 percent or more off regular coach prices.
   Roundtrip tickets must be purchased 24 hours after a reservation
is made and are nonrefundable. They must be bought by Oct. 31 for
trips beginning Nov. 1 through Feb. 15. A Saturday night stayover
is required.
   The new rates, announced Monday, involve 16 Florida cities and
40 northern destinations.
   The rates through the winter season, a peak travel time to
Florida from the northeast, exempts Nov. 23, 27, and 28; Dec. 22
and 23, and Jan. 2 and 3 from the cut-rate fares.

<HEAD>Citicorp, Wells Fargo Report Earnings Decline, Hanover Posts Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp and Wells Fargo & Co. on Tuesday reported sharp
declines in their third-quarter profits while another large banking
concern, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., posted significantly higher
earnings during the same period.
   But all three companies were ahead for the first three quarters
of the year following losses a year ago, when they added to their
loan-loss provisions to cover troubled Third World debt.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, said that
net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $394
million, or $1.13 per share, down 25 percent from earnings of $528
million, or $1.78 a share, in 1987.
   For the first nine months, the company's profit totaled $1.11
billion, or $3.17 a share, vs. a $1.8 billion loss a year ago.
   No. 7-ranked Manufacturers Hanover said it earned $197.7
million, or $3.77 a share, in the third quarter. That was 53
percent higher than net income of $129.1 million, or $2.73 a share,
in 1987.
   Hanover's nine-month earnings totaled $741.2 million, or $14.28
a share, compared with a $1.1 billion loss last year.
   Wells Fargo, ranked 10th, reported quarterly income of $131.7
million, or $2.36 per share, down 15 percent from earnings of $155
million, or $2.77 per share, in the year-ago period.
   Net income for the first nine months of was $376.6 million, or
$6.75 per share, vs. a loss of $60.4 million last year.
   Citicorp said its third-quarter results included an after-tax
reduction in earnings of $22 million as a result of its decision to
reclassify $566 million of its $1.4 billion in loans to Argentina,
reflecting the non-payment of interest for 90 or more days on those
loans.
   Last year Citicorp increased its loan-loss provision by $3
billion to $4.1 billion. Its loan loss provision so far this year
is about 78 percent lower.
   Hanover said its third-quarter profit included an after-tax gain
of $98 million from the sale of a London office building.
   Helping boost its nine-month profit were net gains of about $188
million from the sale of Manufacturers Hanover Consumer Services
Inc., two branch buildings and Manufacturers Hanover Investment
Corp. earlier this year.
   The nine-month profit had been hurt a year ago by the company's
decision to increase its reserve for possible credit losses by $1.7
billion.
   Wells Fargo said market conditions in California, where it is
based, were favorable, but the reduction in quarterly earnings
reflected a $369.3 million charge for reducing its portfolio of
loans to less developed countries.

<HEAD>Illinois First State to Sign International Securities Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement between Illinois and a British
agency to share securities information is the first of its kind
between a U.S. state and a foreign regulatory body, a state
association said Tuesday.
   ``Illinois' agreement with the British underscores the vital
role that the states can play in policing our increasingly
interconnected securities markets,'' said John C. Baldwin,
president of the North American Securities Administrators'
Association.
   ``Much of the securities enforcement in the U.S. is carried out
at the state level,'' he said. ``So it makes good sense that state
securities agencies should play a crucial role in the oversight of
global securities markets.''
   The accord was signed Oct. 12 by Illinois Secretary of State Jim
Edgar and Robert P. Wilkinson, director of enforcement for The
Securities Association in Great Britain, the largest stock market
self-regulatory organization operating under the United Kingdom's
Financial Services Act.
   However, the pact was not announced until the national
organization representing 50 state securities agencies ``received a
firm indication that TSA's board would approve it at their next
meeting Nov. 7,'' said Scott Staff, a spokesman for the U.S. group.
   It is similar to an agreement between TSA and the American Stock
Exchange and to ones reached recently between the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and Canadian provinces and territories, the
NASAA said.
   Under the accord, the Illinois Securities Department and British
association will exchange information on securities transactions
from their respective files for enforcement and regulatory purposes.
   ``This agreement further establishes Chicago and Illinois as a
world financial leader,'' said Edgar, who oversees the activities
of the state's securities department. ``The securities market today
is global in character, so regulation and enforcement should be
global as well.''

   The stock market finished higher today in
moderate trading, rallying briskly after seesawing gently through
much of the trading session.
   Most of the action centered around the issues of several big
food companies that are involved in takeover activity.
   ``The rest of the market is still on hold,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Market watchers said the subdued tone was largely due to
underlying uneasiness in advance of Wednesday's one-year
anniversary of the October stock market collapse.
   On the eve of the anniversary of the debacle, it was another
fairly slow day on the New York Stock Exchange, and brokers said
they had lots of time on their hands.
   Kraft stock shot up in heavy trading, in response to the $90 a
share offered late Monday by Philip Morris in an $11 billion
takeover offer. Philip Morris stock dropped, apparently because
investors felt the acquisition would dilute the earnings of the
cigarette and food giant.
   Philip Morris said it has filed suit against Kraft and some of
its directors in an Illinois court.
   In another major development in the food industry, Pillsbury
said its board of directors unanimously rejected a $60-a-share
tender offer from Grand Metropolitan of Britain.
   Pillsbury later disclosed that it had filed a suit against Grand
Met and Wendell Investments Ltd. for violations of the Shipping Act
of 1916.

   A year ago Wednesday, the world seemed to be
collapsing around Earl E. Ellis as he battled and screamed to keep
order in three tumbling stocks.
   ``It was a very scary time,'' said Ellis, a market maker on the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange, where prices collapsed in
frenzied selling on Oct. 19, 1987, put some of his colleagues out
of business and severely stretched the limits of others. ``There
was disbelief and certainly fear.''
   He spent that night in a nearby hotel, rather than returning to
his suburban Long Island home, wife and teen-age daughter. What
really worried him, he said, was what would happen on Oct. 20.
   ``Logic said it wasn't going to happen again,'' he said.
``Emotion said it was.''
   In an interview on the eve of the anniversary of the worst stock
panic of modern times, Ellis said the anxiety level has fallen
sharply, but so has interest in stocks. Like other NYSE market
makers, known as ``specialists,'' Ellis is now more concerned with
the absence of buyers and sellers, his bread and butter.
   ``Ours is a business of feast or famine. Always has been, always
will be,'' the 47-year-old said in his native Dallas drawl, as he
leaned against his trading post on the cavernous NYSE floor in
lower Manhattan's jungle of skyscrapers. ``It's certainly closer to
famine now.''
   A partner in the specialist firm Benjamin Jacobson & Sons, Ellis
has been in the business for more than a decade. During a typical
day, he buys and sells thousands of shares in Anheuser-Busch,
Tandem Computers and the Student Loan Marketing Association, known
on Wall Street as Sallie Mae.
   As a specialist, his firm has what amounts to a franchise in
these and 37 other stocks on the NYSE floor, acting as an
intermediary for buy and sell orders from brokers stationed along
the floor perimeters.
   In return, the specialist firm is obligated to set opening
prices and keep trading orderly, largely by selling from its own
inventory when other sellers are scarce and buying when buyers are
scarce.
   On Black Monday, Oct. 19, and its volatile aftermath, a
marauding avalanche of sellers threatened to overwhelm the ability
of the NYSE's 54 specialist firms to do their jobs.
   Many were reluctant to buy stocks because they were uncertain
whether other buyers would appear. Others who had spent enormous
amounts of borrowed money to buy stocks faced credit crises with
their banks.
   Ellis's firm, one of Wall Street's strongest, traded more than
$1 billion in securities during the week of the crash.
   The performance of the specialists was criticized in some
post-crash studies, which called them a weakness in a system that
experienced unprecedented strain.
   But Ellis defended what he called the fairest and most efficient
market system, even in the face of new technologies that have
replaced many of the trading functions once performed by humans.
   ``If you ask how the specialists did on Black Monday, you'd get
a different answer from every one,'' Ellis said. ``Some went out of
business, some made bad mistakes. But one has to understand what a
specialist does.
   ``We are a pricing mechanism. We're not here to buy every stock
for sale,'' he said. ``What we're here to do is make sure it's done
in an an orderly fashion. We could have done everything right and
the market could still have come down.''
   Computers can speed the delivery of buy and sell orders to the
trading floor, he said, but the auction process, the bargaining and
haggling that inevitably becomes part of securities trading, will
always be a human domain.
   ``You can't automate the interface of brokers,'' he contended.
``You can't black box that.''
   On the day before the anniversary, the NYSE floor was relatively
quiet, and few people were talking about the crash. ``It's
history,'' said James E. Garlinge, an Ellis colleague who trades
USG Corp. stock.
   In the first hour, Ellis traded a few thousand shares of
Anheuser-Busch with floor brokers and the price moved up | point _
or 62{ cents a share to $33.50. A blue-coated NYSE reporter, who
conveys all trades into a computer system that feeds the exchange's
electronic ticker tape, dutifully recorded the transactions. ``This
is slow,'' Ellis said.
   The biggest action was a few trading posts away at Stokes, Hoyt
& Co., the specialist firm for Kraft Co., where brokers were
screaming to sell because the stock was up nearly $30 a share on a
$90-a-share takeover offer by Philip Morris Cos. Inc.
   Several specialists watching from afar shook their heads in
dismay. To them, takeovers are bad news because the acquired
company's stock will no longer be traded.
   ``It's a product that we lose,'' said James A. Jacobson, another
partner in the Jacobson firm. ``It's very tough to lose a company.''

<NOTE>Eds: Precede LONDON BC</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished higher against most major
currencies Tuesday after a choppy day of trading in the foreign
exchange markets.
   Gold prices fell in New York. In late trading, Republic National
Bank of New York said gold was bid at $410.70 a troy ounce, down
from $411.90 a troy ounce late Monday.
   The U.S. currency began the day on the upswing in Asia, buoyed
by comments in Tokyo from Bank of France governor Jacques de
Larosiere who reiterated support for central bank intervention to
achieve exchange rate stability. The dollar then headed lower in
Europe before turning up again in domestic trading.
   Analysts said that despite the appearance of volatility, the
dollar was stuck in the same narrow range it has been trading in
since spring, between 1.80 and 1.90 West German marks.
   ``All we're seeing is the low end of the same range,'' said
James Pugh, of Bear, Stearns & Co. ``It will continue to do that
until the election.''
   Those following the dollar generally agreed that any drastic
moves up or down were unlikely before the presidential election is
decided next month. Smaller moves within the established trading
range are possible, they said.
   Indeed, some technical analysts attributed the move upward at
the end of day Tuesday to a bounce off the low end of the trading
range.
   In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar rose to
127.70 yen from Monday's 127.20 yen. Later, in London, it slipped
to 127.05 yen. Late in the day in New York the dollar moved to
127.155, up from 127.065 late Monday.
   The dollar gained against the pound in London, where it cost
$1.7515 to buy one pound, cheaper than the $1.7530 it cost late
Monday. But in New York, the pound fetched $1.74805, up from
$1.74635 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, were 1.81125 West German marks, up from 1.80875; 1.52925
Swiss francs, up from 1.52745; 1.20075 Canadian dollars, down from
1.20375; 6.1675 French francs, down from 6.1710; and 1,346.50
Italian lire, unchanged.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.8050 West German marks, down from 1.8120;
1.5280 Swiss francs, down from 1.5295; 6.1735 French francs, down
from 6.1790; 2.0390 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,345.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,348.50, and 1.20095 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2047.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $411.80 a troy ounce, down from $412.20 an ounce
Monday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $412.95 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $412.25 an ounce. In Zurich, gold fell
to $411.00 an ounce from $412.30 late Monday. Earlier, in Hong
Kong, gold rose $1.99 an ounce to close at $416.05.
   On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery was quoted at
$6.355 a troy ounce, down from $6.405 Monday. Silver bullion prices
fell on the London market, where the metal was trading at a late
bid of $6.39 a troy ounce, down from Monday's late $6.43.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Resume Climb On Tight Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices climbed sharply Tuesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange amid renewed fears of tight supplies linked
partly to a miners' strike in Peru, the world's seventh largest
copper producer.
   On other futures markets, precious metals were slightly lower;
most energy futures fell sharply; cattle posted steep while pork
futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   Reports that as many as half of Peru's 70,000 metals miners were
out on strike fueled a late rally in the copper market, analysts
said. The contracts for both spot and December delivery hit new
life-of-contract highs for the 10th time in the past 12 sessions.
   Copper for spot delivery settled at $1.38 a pound, up 3.9 cents
from Monday while the contract for delivery in December rose 3.2
cents to $1.246 a pound.
   The market opened steady and traded on a fairly even keel for
most the session in light of Monday's report that London Metal
Exchange stocks had fallen last week by 4,550 metric tons instead
of the 7,000-to-9,000-ton decline that had been expected, analysts
said.
   Nevertheless, ``LME stocks continued their down trend and
probably will continue to decline,'' said Fred Demler, metals
economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   ``Inventories are critically low, consumption remains good in
Japan, parts of Europe and the United States and production has
faltered a bit as of late,'' he said.
   ``The only thing that's negative in the copper market right now
is that it's due for a technical correction _ it's moved up much
too fast,'' Demler said. ``But most most of the fundamentals
suggest the market will be tight for another five to six months.''
   Gold and silver futures retreated slightly in reaction to a
reversal of recent trends toward a weaker dollar and lower prices
for crude oil and other commodities, Demler said.
   Gold settled $2 to $4 lower with December at $415.10 troy ounce;
silver was 5 cents lower across the board with December at $6.425 a
troy ounce.
   Crude oil futures plunged on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid heavy profit-taking but market players still believes OPEC
members will reach agreement soon on a plan to stabilize prices,
analysts said.
   ``The market was overbought and a lot of people wanted to take
profits,'' said Peter Beutel, energy analyst with Elders Futures
Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 60 cents to 67 cents
lower with November at $14.61 a barrel; heating oil was 1.59 cents
to 1.79 cents lower with November at 42.29 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1 cent lower to .16 cent higher with November at 46.92
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on profit-taking following Monday's advance to
life-of-contract highs for all delivery months, analysts said.
   The cattle market had rallied on expectations for higher cash
markets and ideas that the Agriculture Department's quarterly
cattle-on-feed report, due out after the close on Friday, will show
a significant reduction in the number of cattle being fattened for
slaughter.
   Live cattle settled .35 cent to 1.15 cents lower with October at
72.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to 1.07 cents
lower with October at 81.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with October at 39.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .57 cent lower with February
at 48.77 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade, reflecting the weak tone of the grain export
business, analysts said.
   Corn harvesting was 63 percent complete as of Sunday in the top
17 producing states while soybean harvesting was 90 percent
finished in the top 19 producing states, the USDA said late Monday.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 7\ cents lower with December at $4.23 a
bushel; corn was 2} cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$2.92\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 2{ cents higher with
December at $2.57{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 5{ cents
lower with November at $8.05{ a bushel.
   Stock-index futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Merc,
where the contract for December delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 index settled 2.95 points higher at 281.10

<HEAD>Morgan Stanley Earnings Fall 28.1 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Morgan Stanley Group Inc. said Tuesday its profit fell 28.1
percent in the third quarter as revenue sank 15.7 percent.
   The parent company of Morgan Stanley & Co. said it earned $52.4
million, or $1.96 a share, for the July-September period, down from
$72.9 million, or $2.82 a share, a year earlier. Revenue, which is
gross revenue minus interest expense, fell to $423.8 million from
$502.9 million.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, profit rose to
$286.3 million, or $11.11 a share, from $199.6 million, or $7.83 a
share. Revenue rose to $1.61 billion from $1.43 billion.
   The company said a strong merger and acquisition business helped

   It said its board had authorized the purchase of an additional

<HEAD>Apollo Losses Widen; Tandy Net Rises 1 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Apollo Computer Inc., the struggling maker of computer work
stations, said Tuesday its losses widened in the latest quarter
from a year earlier, while Tandy Corp. said its profit rose
slightly.
   Apollo, based in Chelmsford, Mass., which has been losing the
race for customers with rival Sun Microsystems Inc., said it lost
$3.58 million in the third quarter, compared to a loss of $2.86
million a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent to $157.1 million
from $135 million a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Apollo said it had
a loss of $1.1 million, compared to a profit of $11.2 million, or
31 cents a share, a year earlier. Nine-month revenue rose 20
percent to $469.5 million from $390.7 million.
   Apollo said it had made a major transition in the quarter to new
products, including what it calls a personal supercomputer. It did
not project when it might return to profitability.
   Tandy, the Fort Worth, Texas-based owner of Radio Shack that
makes computers and other electronic products, said its earnings
rose 1 percent to $64.9 million, or 72 cents a share, in the first
quarter of its fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, from $64.3
million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 12
percent to $937 million from $838 million a year earlier.

   A late rally catapulted the stock market Tuesday
to its highest close since last October's crash, as Wall Street
overcame its jitters on the eve of the debacle's one-year
anniversary.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 19.38 points to
2,159.85, scoring most of the gain in the waning minutes of the
session. The blue-chip average brushed past the previous post-crash
high of 2,158.96 reached on Columbus Day, Oct. 10.
   The crash anniversary ``has probably got some people a little
uneasy,'' said Bill Raftery, an analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. ``People should look beyond it; the world isn't
coming to an end.''
   Tuesday's post-crash peak was still 21 percent below the
all-time high of 2,722.42 reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8-to-5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
841 issues up, 568 down and 546 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 162.5 million shares, up
from 119.29 million in Monday's session. Nationwide, consolidated
volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional
exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 191.79
million shares.
   Stocks spent most of the session seesawing gently between the
plus and minus columns, until the late buying spree. The rally was
fueled by takeover activity involving several big food companies,
which gave the market support throughout the day.
   ``There's just rampant takeover speculation going on,'' said
Steve Becker, a partner in the investment firm Wayne Hummer & Co.
in Chicago.
   Kraft stock shot up 28[ a share to 88\ in heavy trading, just
below the $90 a share offered late Monday by Philip Morris in an
$11 billion takeover offer. Philip Morris stock dropped 4{ to 95{,
apparently because investors felt the acquisition would dilute the
earnings of the cigarette and food giant.
   Philip Morris said it has filed suit against Kraft and some of
its directors in an Illinois court.
   In another major development in the food industry, Pillsbury
rose ] to 59, after an earlier decline. Pillsbury said its board of
directors unanimously rejected a $60-a-share tender offer from
Grand Metropolitan of Britain.
   Pillsbury later disclosed that it had filed a suit against Grand
Met and Wendell Investments Ltd. for violations of the Shipping Act
of 1916.
   Among other blue-chip issues, IBM surged 3\ to 124], Citicorp
rose | to 25], AT&T gained } at 27{ and Exxon was unchanged at 45[.
   Warner Lambert dropped 4\ to 72{ amid uncertainty about whether
the Food and Drug Administration would allow the company to expand
the labeling of Lopid, an anti-cholesterol drug, to specify its use
in preventing heart disease.
   The NYSE's composite index was up 1.45, at 157.32.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 3.69 to 321.44, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.97 at 279.38.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index edged up
0.88 to 304.15. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 386.25, up 1.24.

<TEXT>
   U.S. rice exports are expected to be up around
7 percent in the 1988-89 marketing year, rebounding from a 14
percent decline last season, the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.
   Exports for the year that began Aug. 1 are forecast at 2.45
million metric tons, milled rice equivalent, up from 2.29 million
tons in 1987-88, the department's Economic Research Service said in
its new outlook report.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. There are slightly more than
22 hundredweight of rice in a ton.
   Rice production this year is estimated at 156.7 million
hundredweight, or about 7.1 million tons of unmilled (rough) rice
equivalent, a 23 percent increase from last year. On a milled
basis, that would be about 4.98 million tons.
   World production of milled rice in 1988-89 is forecast at a
near-record of 319.8 million tons, up 4 percent from last year's
drought-reduced harvest in South and Southeast Asia, the report
said.

<HEAD>Warner's Profit Up Nearly Doubles in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warner Communications Inc. reported Tuesday that
its third-quarter profit nearly doubled from a year earlier,
boosted by strong performances from its movie, recorded music and
cable television divisions.
   The communications and entertainment company said its net income
in the three months ended Sept. 30 jumped to $105.4 million, or 66
cents a share, from $66.2 million, or 41 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose to $1.03 billion from $824.1 million.
   ``This achievement demonstrates the growing worldwide demand for
our entertainment products,'' Chairman Steven J. Ross said.
``Warner Cable continues to show dramatic growth and is becoming a
meaningful contributor to (Warner Communications') operating
results.''
   Late last month, Warner vowed to fight a state court ruling
blocking its proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of Lorimar
Telepictures Corp.
   In the first nine months of the year, Warner's net income surged
to $322.1 million, or $2.02 a share, from $236.1 million, or $1.50
a share.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $3.01 billion from $2.38 billion a

and Kurt Russell, and ``Accidental Tourist'' with William Hurt,
Kathleen Turner and Geena Davis.

<HEAD>Tobacco Companies Agree To Put Warnings On Products</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigar and pipe tobacco manufacturers in
California have decided to put cancer warnings on their products
rather than fight a lawsuit that could have resulted in thousands
of dollars in fines.
   The manufacturers already were losing money in sales because a
chain of stores refused to stock their products and others
threatened to follow suit.
   The lawsuit was filed, and some products removed, after the
manufacturers failed to comply with Proposition 65, a toxins
initiative passed by California voters in 1986.
   The initiative requires businesses to provide ``clear and
reasonable'' warnings to consumers exposed to chemicals known to
cause cancer or birth defects.
   ``The tobacco manufacturers were very eager to settle and do the
right thing,'' said Duane Peterson, a spokesman for state Attorney
General John Van de Kamp.
   The manufacturers made the decision Monday. But on Tuesday,
cigars and pipe tobacco were still absent from the shelves of Vons
supermarkets, the 345-market statewide chain that became the first
supermarket company to announce it would pull the products from it
shelves.
   ``The shelves are still empty; Vons has not seen a copy of the
agreement,'' said spokeswoman Vickie Sanders. She said the grocery
company would withhold comment on the agreement until it had been
reviewed.
   Under the settlement, companies will begin placing warning
labels on cigars and pipe tobacco. The state has agreed to waive
the fines of $2,500 a day it had threatened to place on every pack
of cigars or other tobacco products that did not contain such
warnings.
   Since passage of Proposition 65, there have been several court
fights over which substances should be classified as toxic.
Cigarettes, chewing tobacco and snuff all carry federally mandated
warnings.
   ``We want to make it clear that we have been in compliance (with
federal warning laws) for a year and a half. We are not part of the
lawsuit,'' said Chris Close, a spokesman for the Smokeless Tobacco
Institute in Washington.
   The institute represents makers of snuff and chewing tobacco.
Close said the state Health and Welfare agency said in a July 1
letter that the warnings on snuff and chewing tobacco ``are
consistent with the spirit and intended effect'' of Proposition 65.
   ``Although labeling is burdensome, the manufacturers preferred
to avoid lengthy and costly litigation,'' Norman Sharp, president
of the Washington-based Cigar Association, said in a statement.
   Most cigar products sold nationally will bear the California
warning because it would be impossible to label only those sold in
California, Sharp said.
   The lawsuit, filed Sept. 30, prompted at least eight retailers
and 25 tobacco companies to agree to the warnings.
   Van de Kamp filed the lawsuit about two months after
environmental groups said they would seek $1.3 billion in fines
from stores and manufacturers for violating the Proposition 65
warning requirement.
   After Vons announcement of Oct. 4, Lucky Stores, with 343
markets across the state, followed by giving tobacco makers 30 days
to label their products or have them removed from Lucky's stores.
   Safeway Stores Inc., which operates 221 stores in California,
has posted its own warning signs near cigar, pipe and chewing
tobacco displays. The company also told tobacco manufacturers that
it would no longer accept shipments of products without labels
after Monday.

<HEAD>Delaware Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Appeal on Macmillan-Kohlberg
Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five-month-old takeover fight for Macmillan
Inc. was put on hold Tuesday for at least two weeks as a result of
court action in Delaware.
   The Delaware Supreme Court agreed to hear British publisher
Robert Maxwell's appeal of a lower court ruling relating to
Macmillan's merger agreement with a rival suitor and set oral
arguments for Nov. 2.
   The publishing giant has agreed to be acquired in a leveraged
buyout for $2.5 billion by a group led by the investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and including Macmillan senior
management.
   Maxwell has offered $2.51 billion for Macmillan under certain
conditions through his Maxwell Communication Corp.
   Earlier in the day, the Delaware Chancery Court issued a
preliminary injunction preventing the Kohlberg group from
completing its tender offer for Macmillan's stock until Maxwell
could appeal. That order will apparently remain in effect until
after the Supreme Court issues a decision in the case.
   ``Nothing can happen until November. Neither side can change
their offer. The status quo is maintained,'' said Macmillan
spokesman David Jackson.
   ``It doesn't come as a surprise,'' said a top Maxwell financial
adviser, Robert S. Pirie. ``This is a major case under Delaware law
and I would have been surprised if the Supreme Court hadn't agreed
to hear it.''
   The court action in Wilmington, Del., came a day after Judge
Jack Jacobs refused to grant a preliminary injunction requested by
Maxwell against a ``lock-up'' provision that Macmillan granted
Kohlberg.
   The provision would give Kohlberg the right to buy four of
Macmillan's businesses for about $865 million if its merger
agreement fell through.
   Under the merger pact, Kohlberg agreed to pay $90.05 a share in
cash and securities for Macmillan's stock.
   Maxwell, who is determined to make his company one of the
world's biggest communications concerns, has offered $90.25 in cash
for each of Macmillan's 27.8 million shares provided that, among
other things, the lock-up provision is eliminated.
   Maxwell contends the lock-up provision is unfair and would leave
the company with a $250 million tax liability.
   He has said he would drop his tender offer if he were allowed to
buy the same four businesses for $900 million. They include the
Berlitz language centers, the directory division, the direct
marketing division and a division that publishes state legal codes.
   The fight for Macmillan has been underway since mid-May when a
group led by the wealthy Texan Robert M. Bass proposed acquiring
the company for $64 a share. The Bass group has since dropped out
of the bidding.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan fell 50
cents a share to $88.25.

   Time Inc. and Tribune Co. reported Tuesday that their profits
climbed in the third quarter, while McClatchy Newspapers Inc. said
its after-tax income declined and Media General Inc. said its
profit matched that of a year ago.
   Time said its net profit rose to $81 million, or $1.42 a share,
up 9.5 percent from $74 million, or $1.24 a share, in the
July-September quarter last year. Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $1.13
billion from $1.07 billion.
   Time attributed its gain to strong performance by its books
group, which includes Book-of-the-Month Club, Time-Life and Little
Brown. The New York-based company also publishes such magazines as
Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Life and has interests in
broadcasting,
   For the first nine months of the year, Time's profit rose 16.7
percent to $231 million, or $4 a share, from $198 million, or $3.30
a share, in the comparable period last year. Revenue rose 6.4
percent to $3.3 billion from $3.1 billion.
   Tribune said its third-quarter profit soared 55.9 percent to
$51.6 million, or 69 cents a share, from $33.1 million, or 42 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 8 percent to $575
million from $532 million.
   The Chicago-based company said it had healthy gains in all three
of its business segments _ newspapers, broadcast stations and the
Chicago Cubs baseball team.
   Tribune's net earnings for the first nine months totaled $147.5
million, or $1.94 a share, up 50 percent from $98.3 million, $1.24
a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 9 percent to $1.7 billion from
$1.6 billion.
   McClatchy said its third-quarter profit fell 3.6 percent to $7.2
million, or 25 cents a share, from $7.5 million, or 29 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 6 percent to $88.3 million
from $83.3 million.
   The company, a Sacramento, Calif.-based publisher of daily and
community newspapers, cited softness in advertising and increased
newsprint costs for the decline.
   Profit for the first nine months rose 10.3 percent to $19.2
million, or 68 cents a share, from $17.4 million, or 66 cents a
share, in 1987. Revenues rose 7.4 percent to $261.3 million from
$243.4 million.
   Media General, based in Richmond, Va., said it earned $10.8
million, or 38 cents a share, in the latest three months, the same
as a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 2 percent to $181.8 million from
$177.5 million.
   The company's newspaper division had decreased earnings, while
results from its newsprint division rose. It said operating profit
for the northern Virginia cable system are above forecasts.
   The company said that nine-month earnings totaled $38.4 million,
or $1.34 per share, up 22 percent from $31.5 million, or $1.10 a
share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 6 percent to $564.4 million from $531.5
million a year ago.

<TEXT>
   Small business growth has remained healthy after
the stock market crash a year ago, with sales and employment gains
outpacing those of larger corporations, according to an economic
index reported Tuesday.
   American Express Co. said its Small Business Growth Index rose
sharply in the first half of 1988, to 4.46 from 1.48 for the
previous six months.
   The strongest gains were in the mid-Atlantic states of New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which recovered quickly from the Oct.
19 stock market plunge, which occured a year ago Wednesday.
   ``... The dramatic increase in the Growth Index reflects an
overall resiliency within the small business sector,'' said David
Birch, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is
co-chairman of the American Express Small Business Partnership.
   The index measures the semi-annual growth in employment, sales
and new incorporations of some 7 million small companies _ defined
as those with 100 or fewer employees.
   The index found that small business employment rose 1.97 percent
and sales grew 1.3 percent in the first half of this year, compared
with a 1.90 percent jobs gain and 1.06 percent sales rise in the
second half of 1987. New incorporations remained steady.
   While small business sales and employment growth outpaced
similar rates for large business, the gap between the two narrowed
in the first six months of this year, the report said.
   In the last half of 1987, small business sales grew at a rate
8.2 times those of large business, but in the first half of 1988,
the rate narrowed to 3.7 times, the report said.
   ``Large business cutbacks, prevalent throughout the 1980s,
appear to have bottomed out,'' said Birch. ``Additionally, large
business employment is now accelerating and sales growth, almost
nonexistent last year, is beginning to rise to the level of
high-performing small business.''
   The weakest growth area for small business was in the Mountain
States region, where sales dropped 2.35 percent and employment
edged up 1.31 percent. This was the only area showing a negative
indicator, the report said.
   The biggest turnaround came in the region that includes
Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi where overall sales,
employment and new incorporations grew 1.03 percent after a 3.94
drop the previous six months.
   New England ranked first for employment growth at 2.33 percent,
while the Pacific states led in sales growth with a rise of 2.72
percent, the report said.

<HEAD>Maryland Bank Committee To Recommend Rejection of Allied Irish
Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>

   First Maryland Bancorp was advised Tuesday to
reject a $327.6 million offer from Allied Irish Banks PLC to
purchase the 50.3 percent of stock in the bank it doesn't already
own.
   But a special advisory committee to First Maryland's board
recommended the bank continue discussions with Allied toward a more
acceptable offer.
   Dublin, Ireland-based Allied, which already owns 49.7 percent of
Maryland Bancorp, has offered $35.25 in cash for the remaining
outstanding common shares.
   The 183-year-old Maryland bank referred the offer to a special
committee for review. According to a statement issued Tuesday, the
panel will recommend the board reject the offer.
   The panel said, however, that it recommended discussions
continue ``with a view to negotiating improvements in the terms of
the Allied Irish offer.'' The panel noted, however, that ``there is
no assurance that an acceptable agreement will be ... agreed to.''
   Allied Irish Banks acquired its existing stake in First Maryland
for $151 million beginning five years ago. It bought 43 percent of
the stock outright, then purchased about 2 percent of the stock in
each subsequent year. Allied said it would use cash reserves to
purchase the remaining stock.

<HEAD>Passengers Apparently Not Shying Away Despite Illness Outbreak</HEAD>

   Northwest Airlines passengers are not shying
away from in-flight meals despite a link between food served aboard
some flights and the outbreak of an intestinal illness, an airline
spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``We haven't had any reports of any problems,'' said Redmond
Tyler. ``Can I say that nobody has turned (airline food) down? No,
I can't tell you that. But we haven't heard of anything major.''
   Shigellosis has been confirmed in passengers on nine flights
from Minneapolis-St. Paul to seven cities: Detroit; Denver;
Nashville, Tenn.; Newark, N.J.; Seattle; Chicago; and Louisville,
Ky., said Buddy Ferguson, a spokesman for the Minnesota Health
Department. In addition, there was a confirmed case on an in-bound
flight from Phoenix, he said.
   Ferguson said Tuesday that possible cases of the illness have
been identified by the department on about 145 flights since Sept.
15, including flights overseas to Japan and East Germany.
   State epidemiologist Michael Osterholm said Monday it's still
not clear whether food now being served on Northwest flights is
safe and Ferguson said Tuesday that the situation had not changed.
   ``I can't confirm that it is safe and I can't say it isn't,''
Osterholm said.
   Confirmed cases of the illness have been found among passengers
who flew on the airline as late as last Thursday, Osterholm said.
   All the confirmed cases have been traced to food prepared for
the airline at the Marriott Corp. kitchen, which services Northwest
at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   That facility serves Northwest exclusively and prepares 100,000
meals per week for more than 900 Northwest flights out of the Twin
Cities.
   Leslie Schlags, a corporate spokeswoman for Marriott, said
Tuesday that tests on the company's 360 workers should be complete
by Thursday and results should be complete before the weekend is
out. She said Marriott is testing all in-bound and out-bound food
at its kitchen in addition to testing employees.
   The bacterial infection was first identified in 21 Minnesota
Vikings football players and staff in the week after their Oct. 2
game in Miami.
   The disease causes intense diarrhea and other symptoms that can
last for five to seven days. It spreads easily from person to
person. Of people exposed to the bacteria, about 10 percent usually
get sick, Osterholm said.

<HEAD>Burger King President Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   After serving two years as president of troubled
Burger King, Charles S. Olcott resigned Tuesday in the fast-food
company's second top management shakeup this year.
   The resignation comes as Burger King's parent, Minneapolis-based
Pillsbury Co., is scrambling to defend itself against an unwanted
takeover bid.
   Analysts said it was Olcott's failure to reverse Burger King's
losing trend that led to his departure. Under Olcott, Burger King
embarked on an expensive and ultimately disappointing marketing
campaign based on the slogan ``We do it like you'd do it.''
   William Maguire, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York,
said Olcott ``wasn't a marketing man when they needed a marketing
man badly.''
   Pillsbury is in the process of defending itself against an
unsolicited $5.23 billion tender offer launched by London-based
Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Analysts speculated that Pillsbury might opt to sell Burger
King, the world's second-largest hamburger chain, in an effort to
preserve its independence. A sale could bring as much as $2 billion.
   Pillsbury's board unanimously rejected Grand Met's $60-a-share
offer Tuesday, calling it ``inadequate and not in the best
interests of the company and its shareholders.''
   ``They're fighting the only battle they can,'' said John
McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York.
   The hamburger chain accounts for about one-third of Pillsbury's
sales and about two-thirds of its profits but has not done well
recently. Its pre-tax profits have decline by more than 50 percent,
from $119.2 million in fiscal 1986 to $48.2 million for the year
ended May 31, the company reported.
   Pillsbury Chairman Philip L. Smith said Tuesday in urging
shareholders to reject Grand Met's bid that significant investments
have been made to improve Burger King operations. He said improved
performance is ``critical'' to the chain.
   Olcott's departure marks yet another major management shakeup
for the fast-food chain, which has had five chairman and eight
presidents since Pillsbury took over in 1967.
   Most recently, J. Jeffery Campbell resigned as head of
Pillsbury's ailing restaurant group in June.
   Jerry W. Levin, a Pillsbury executive vice president, was named
Burger King's chairman. He had worked previously in mergers and
acquisitions at Pillsbury, prompting financial analysts to
speculate Pillsbury might be preparing to get rid of the
Miami-based restaurant chain.
   ``The guy's good at doing deals,'' McMillin said. ``I've got to
think he's been brought in to do a deal.''
