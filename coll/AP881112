<HEAD>President Signs Taxpayers' `Bill of Rights'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed a ``bill of
rights'' to protect taxpayers against overzealous tax collectors,
but he still must act on bills to put more money into fighting drugs
and to authorize the death penalty for some drug kingpins.
   The tax bill provides $4.1 billion in benefits to farmers and
other groups.
   ``After two years of fighting for a bill of rights, the American
taxpayer can at long last declare victory,'' said Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark. ``For the first time since the Internal Revenue Service was
established 124 years ago, Congress has done something for the
taxpayer rather than to him.''
   Pryor, chairman of the Senate's IRS Oversight Committee, was one
of the principal architects of the measure, along with Sens. Harry
Reid, D-Nev. and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Robin Tallon,
D-S.C.
   The Tax Corrections Act was aimed initially at refining the
massive tax overhauls of 1986. The ``bill of rights'' was inserted
by lawmakers who wanted to rein in what some said was an overly
aggressive IRS.
   The law requires 30 days' notice before the IRS can seize bank
accounts and other property. It also prohibits the IRS from
promoting employees on the basis of how much they collect from
taxpayers.
   Reagan signed the measure Thursday, and the White House announced
the signing Friday without comment.
   The law will have no effect on the federal deficit. Although it
would cut taxes by $4.1 billion over three years, it would raise
others by the same amount.
   It orders the government to buy 540 acres bordering the Civil War
battlefield at Manassas, Va., where developers wanted to build a
shopping mall.
   Other major provisions:
   _Extend expiring tax benefits to help lower-income families buy
their first home; reward businesses for increased spending for
research and experimentation, and boost incentives for investment in
low-income rental housing.
   _Renew an expired provision that allows workers to exclude as
taxable income tuition payments made by their employers; most
graduate study would not qualify.
   _Extend an exclusion for the value of employer-financed
legal-service benefits.
   _Prohibit a business deduction for the basic monthly cost of a
home telephone.

<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are major provisions of a
bill signed Friday by President Reagan designed to clear up
confusing language and correct errors in the landmark tax overhaul
enacted in 1986.
   _BILL OF RIGHTS: A ``taxpayer's bill of rights'' to rein in what
some lawmakers view as an overly aggressive Internal Revenue
Service. For example, the agency would have to give 30 days' notice
before seizing bank accounts and other property, and would be
prohibited from promoting employees on the basis of how much they
collect.
   _DIESEL: Wipes out a 1987 requirement that farmers, construction
companies and other tax-exempt, off-road users of diesel fuel pay
the federal tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and later apply for a refund.
   _MUTUAL FUNDS: For 1988 and 1989, permit owners of mutual fund
shares to deduct certain operating expenses of the fund without
regard to a general provision allowing deduction of only
miscellaneous expenses that exceed 2 percent of income.
   _HIGHER EDUCATION: Exempts from taxation interest earned on U.S.
savings bonds that are redeemed to finance a college or vocational
education, starting in 1990.
   _TUITION AID: Renews for 1988 an expired law allowing a worker to
avoid tax on up to $5,250 a year of employer-provided education
assistance. Graduate education would not qualify.
   _HOUSING: Extends through 1989 a tax credit for owners of newly
constructed low-income rental housing. Also, extends through 1989
and modifies a tax exemption for bonds issued by state and local
governments to help low-income families buy their first home.
   _TOBACCO: Imposes a tax of 45 cents per pound on pipe tobacco.
   _WRITERS: Allows free-lance writers, artists and photographers to
deduct work-related expenses even before a project produces income.
   _`HEIFER TAX': Permits livestock farmers to deduct expenses of
producing livestock before the animals begin generating income, thus
repealing what has become known as the ``heifer tax.''
   _ATHLETICS: Allows an 80 percent deduction for contributions to
college athletic scholarship funds even when such ``gifts''
guarantee a fan the privilege of buying a game ticket.
   _RESEARCH: Extends through 1989 a credit for increased spending
for research and experimentation.
   _JOB TRAINING: Extends through 1989 a credit under which the
government pays the first year of wages for certain newly hired
economically disadvantaged workers.
   _CONTRACTORS: Further restricts the ``completed-contract'' method
of accounting that allows defense contractors and most big
construction companies to delay taxes on part of their profits until
a project is completed. This change will raise $1.3 billion.
   _CORPORATIONS: Accelerate estimated tax payments from
corporations that switch from an annualized method of computation,
raising $869 million.
   _LIFE INSURANCE: Removes some of the tax advantages of using
single-premium life insurance as an investment. Loans from such
policies would be taxed as cash withdrawals; the new rules would
apply to policies whose cash value builds more quickly than one paid
through seven equal annual premiums. The change would cost
policyholders $345 million.
   _BUSINESS MEALS: Permit operators of offshore or Alaska oil rigs
and of some commercial vessels (but not luxury liners) to deduct the
full cost of meals provided to employees; most business may deduct
only 80 percent.
   _HOME SALE: Allows a surviving spouse to defer taxation on
profits from the sale of a principal home, just as though the spouse
had not died. Present law denies such a break if a spouse dies after
a home is sold and before a new one is built. Also, the provision
allowing a person over 55 to avoid tax on up to $125,000 of profits
from the sale of a principal home in which he or she had lived at
least three of the last five years would be available to a person
who spends up to four of those five years in a nursing home.
   _HOME PHONE: Prohibits any person with a home-based business from
deducting any part of the base monthly telephone charge as a
business expense.
   _FARM MACHINERY: Tightens depreciation provisions for
single-purpose farm structures, such as poultry houses, and farm
machinery.
   _FARM INCOME: Expands a law allowing farmers to defer for one
year income from the drought-forced sale of livestock. Farmers also
could defer taxes on payments received as a result of drought-caused
crop losses.
   _BANKS: Renews a tax break for healthy savings and loan
associations that take over failing associations, and extends the
benefit to banks.
   _BLOOD DONORS: Permits states and blood-collection facilities to
require blood donors to list their Social Security numbers so they
can be traced if tests determine their blood is carrying the AIDS
virus.

   An ally for parents in the battle to sift through
the annual barrage of products aimed at children has released a
recommended list of books, toys, videos, records, games and
television shows.
   Parents' Choice, a quarterly newspaper that calls itself ``a
review of children's media,'' announced Friday an eclectic list of
winners in its annual awards competition.
   The winners range from Tracy Chapman's debut album to a
Boston-based children's television show to a publication called Owl
Magazine.
   ``What we do is give information to parents so they can make
their own choices about what is right, good and appropriate for
out-of-school learning,'' said Diana Huss Green, editor-in-chief of
the newspaper, published by the non-profit Parents' Choice
Foundation.
   ``The aim of these awards is to lead mothers and fathers to
holiday purchases that are practical and exciting,'' Green said.
``They must work for children of all backgrounds and skills, be of
lasting standards and they must be fun.''
   Most award categories contain four age groups; each age group has
three to four winners. A partial list includes:
   _Toys: the Circus Seal by Dakin, for newborns to age 3; the
Puppet Factory by Quincrafts, ages 3-5; the Skywatcher's Weather Set
by Bushnell, ages 8-12; and the Omagles Super Set by Century
Products, for the family.
   _Home videos: ``Pecos Bill'' from Sony, ages 4-8; ``Bach and
Broccoli'' from Family Home Entertainment, ages 8-11; and ``The
Grizzlies'' from Vestron, ages 12-up.
   _Rock music: ``Tracy Chapman'' by Tracy Chapman, ``Wide Awake in
Dreamland'' by Pat Benatar, ``One Moment in Time,'' the 1988 Summer
Olympics album.
   _Picture books: ``John Patrick Norman McHennessy _ The Boy Who
Was Always Late,'' by John Burningham, Crown Publishers;
``Sleepers,'' by Dyal Kaur Khalsa, Clarkson Potter Inc.;
``Goldilocks and the Three Bears,'' by James Marshall, Dial.
   _Computer programs: ``Amandastories: Inigo,'' Voyager Co., ages
3-up; ``Superprint!,'' Scholastic Inc., ages 6-up; and ``Where in
Europe is Carmen Sandiego?'' Broderbund, ages 9-14.
   _Television shows: ``The New Explorers,'' WBBM, Chicago; ``Home
Turf,'' KRON, San Francisco, ``Ready to Go,'' WNEV, Boston.
   _Magazines: Let's Find Out, Scholastic, ages preschool-5; Penny
Power, Consumer Reports, ages 8-14; Owl Magazine, Young Naturalist
Foundation, ages 8-12.
   The selections, judged by parents and children, were based on
nominations and judgments of critics such as David Bianculli of the
New York Post, Ed Bark of The Dallas Morning News, Michael Medved of
TV's ``Sneak Previews,'' Mopsy Strange Kennedy of The Boston Globe,
and Matt Roush of USA Today.
   Parents' Choice Foundation, based in suburban Newton, was formed
10 years ago in response to what the group's literature calls an
``onslaught'' of products aimed at youngsters.
   ``We have now a large group of parents who are the most educated
in history, and many are much older as well,'' Green said.
``Products for children are being aimed at them. They're barraged
with stuff.''

<TEXT>
   GULF STREAM, Fla. _ A long weekend of ocean swimming, jogging and
telephoning political associates from this exclusive Atlantic
seaside community is President-elect George Bush's formula for
unwinding from the election.
   While aides in Washington work today on the transition that will
bring Bush's appointees to the White House next Jan. 20, Bush and
his wife, Barbara, are spending their second full day vacationing at
the seaside home of their multimillionaire friends William and Sarah
Farish in this exclusive beachfront community.
   Bush intends to return to Washinton late Monday or Tuesday, when
he has a meeting scheduled with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   On Friday, Bush told The Associated Press he had spent the
morning poolside talking on the telephone to various political
associates, including former President Nixon, whom Bush called to
thank for sending a congratulatory telegram.
   Bush, appearing in high spirits and in a happy mood as he kidded
with his hosts and wife, said he still had not settled down after
the election.
   ``I haven't really gotten down to the bottom of the unwinding
yet,'' he said.
   He went for a jog, accompanied by his Secret Service agents, for
about two miles around the Gulf Stream Country Club golf course
across the palm tree-lined street from the Farish home.
   Bush and Farish joined their wives, who had been walking on the
beach, and then went out to a Coast Guard cutter stationed about 400
yards offshore. The president-elect invited along an Associated
Press reporter who had greeted him at his driveway.
   The group was ferried to the cutter Point Barnes by a motorized
rubber raft, and the Bushes jumped in for a swim _ Mrs. Bush first,
followed by her husband.
   This reporter accepted an unexpected invitation and followed them
in.
   Mrs. Bush, an avid swimmer, swam the full distance back to shore.
The president-elect grabbed a line on the back of the raft. He told
his agents and aides to ``rev it up'' for the tow back to shore in
the choppy, warm Atlantic.
   Back on shore, Bush playfully took a camera from his official
photographer and snapped pictures of his wife and friends.
   He commented several times about how pleasant the balmy setting
was and joked that he was ``roughing it'' by working at poolside.
Later he played some golf.
   Among those with whom he spoke on the telephone, Bush said, were
GOP leaders South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, Illinois Gov.
James Thompson and New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and Democratic Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia.
   Asked if he was doing much work on the White House transition,
Bush said that was being handled by his team in Washington. Was he
making lists of potential appointees?
   ``No, no,'' he said, then headed off for an afternoon nap.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia and China, participants in a
secret arms deal two years ago, have agreed to open trade offices in
each other's capitals.
   A Chinese Embassy statement issued Friday said the two countries'
ambassadors to the United States, Saudi Arabian Prince Bandar bin
Sultan, and Chinese envoy Han Xu, signed a memorandum of
understanding in Washington to set up ``commercial representative
offices.''
   The decision was reached ``with a view to further developing the
friendly relations and cooperation between China and Saudi Arabia in
the economic and commercial field,'' embassy spokesman Wu Zurong
said.
   It was disclosed earlier this year that Saudi Arabia secretly
purchased medium-range missiles from China in 1986. The State
Department told Congress last May that while Saudi Arabia refused to
allow U.S. inspection of the Chinese missiles it assured the United
States that the launchers would not be equipped with nuclear or
chemical warheads and it backed this by signing the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
   The opening of trade offices is often regarded in diplomacy as a
symbol of thawing relations and a prelude to formal diplomatic
relations between countries that do not recognize each other, such
as Saudi Arabia and the People's Republic of China.
   Saudi Arabia is one of the larges countries in the world that has
continued to recognize the rival Chinese Nationalist government in
Taiwan. The policy was explained in the past as one of support for
offshore Taiwan's staunch anti-communism and opposition to the
official atheism of mainland China.
   But in recent months Taiwan newspapers have noted that the Saudis
and some other countries were drawing closer to Beijing and they
have speculated that those countries might switch their diplomatic
recognition. For its part, Taiwan has been relaxing restrictions
against its citizens' private contacts with the Chinese mainland and
expanding trade and other contacts with communist countries of the
Soviet bloc.
   As of last January, mainland China had formal relations with 135
countries and Taiwan, only 23. The United States switched official
recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 1978 and maintains a broad
range of relations with Taiwan at a non-official level.

<TEXT>
   The military government says it will not
take sides in next year's presidential election, but has warned
Chileans about ``the danger'' of returning Marxist parties to power.
   In a speech Friday on radio and television, Interior Minister
Carlos Caceres also rejected opposition demands for the early
resignation of President Augusto Pinochet, who was defeated in an
Oct. 5 referendum.
   Caceres was appointed interior minister after the referendum in
which voters rejected a military proposal that Pinochet, 72, remain
in power until 1997.
   Gen. Pinochet, the army commander, has ruled Chile since leading
the coup in September 1973 that ousted the elected government of
Marxist President Salvador Allende.
   According to provisions of the 1980 constitution, Pinochet's
defeat in the referendum makes an open presidential election
mandatory in December 1989, with the president surrendering power to
the winner in March 1990.
   Opposition leaders have demandad constitutional changes to allow
a speedier transition to democracy. Pinochet has refused to step
down before 1990.
   Caceres said of next year's election: ``The government will not
take any side, as it understands it has a subsidiary political role
and must guarantee the develoment of the tasks that correspond to
political parties and independent sectors.
   ``Although the government has the firm purpose of not involving
itself in the upcoming electoral contest, it must warn about the
danger of bringing to power certain groups that are close to
totalitarism,'' Caceres added.
   ``The government calls on the nation's majorities to reject once
and for all the extremists.''

   Three East German youth choir members and an
engineer of an accompanying orchestra defected while on a concert
tour of Japan, a Foreign Ministry official said today.
   Three 17-year-old members of the Dresden Kreuzchor Chorus,
Johannes Kluegling, Michael Diedrich and Thomas Nitschke, left their
Tokyo hotel in late October or earlier this month and asked for
asylum at the West German Embassy, the official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the three
went on to West Germany on Nov. 7, while a fourth defector,
Frank-Christian Budde, 42, an engineer of the Dresden Philharmonic
Orchestra, left Japan on Nov. 9.
   The ministry official would not provide further details due to
humanitarian concerns except to say the defections were not
political.
   West German embassy officials were not available for comment due
to a holiday.
   The Dresden Kreuzchor Chorus is one of the world's oldest choirs.
About 150 chior members and the orchestra arrived in Tokyo Oct. 26
for a tour of five Japanese cities, including Tokyo, Yokohama and
Osaka, according to the concert organizer.
   The chorus and the orchestra are to leave Tokyo on Sunday.

   Reclusive multimillionaire Doris Duke has
adopted a 35-year-old woman who has been living with her for three
years, her lawyer said.
   Miss Duke, 75, adopted Chandi Hefner, an ``environmentalist,
preservationist and conservationist'' who spends her time ``doing
things as a good citizen as Miss Duke does,'' attorney Donald A.
Robinson said Friday. The adoption took place Thursday.
   Miss Duke, who owns a walled, 2,700-acre estate in north-central
New Jersey, attracted publicity when she allowed Imelda Marcos to
take her private jet from Hawaii to New York to face federal
racketeering charges and posted bail for the former Philippines
first lady last week.
   Robinson said Miss Duke and Miss Hefner met socially in Hawaii
and New York, where Miss Duke also maintains homes.
   Miss Hefner, who also owns property in Hawaii, had been
``estranged from her family for a number of years,'' has never been
married and has no children, he said.
   Robinson would not comment on whether Miss Hefner would become
the heir of Miss Duke, who has been married twice and has no other
children.
   Miss Duke, the daughter of James B. Duke, the tobacco and
electric power magnate and benefactor of Duke University, has a
fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $800 million and by her
former business manager at $2.5 billion.

   Actor Timothy Dalton suffered a slight wrist
injury while filming a scene for the next James Bond film, ``License
Revoked.''
   In the scene, Bond, played by Dalton, had just been exposed as a
mole in a drug lord's cocaine laboratory and was supposed to dangle
from the end of a conveyor, his feet inches from a grinding machine.
   But during Thursday's shooting, Dalton's watch caught on a metal
hook as he flipped off the end of the conveyor, causing a slight
cut. Dalton completed the scene after a doctor patched the injury on
the set.
   In the movie, Bond's 007 license to kill is lifted by the British
secret service. Despite that, he goes after the drug lord, played by
actor Robert Davi, to avenge an assassination attempt on an American
CIA agent.

   Violinist Dmitri Sitkovetsky, who emigrated from
the Soviet Union to the United States 11 years ago, will give four
concerts in Moscow next month, his press agent said.
   The 34-year-old violinist will make his first return appearance
Dec. 19 with the Moscow Philharmonic at Tchaikovsky Hall. His
father, Julian, a noted violinist, gave his last performance at the
hall before his death in 1958.
   ``He has been invited back by the Moscow Philharmonic for a
memorial concert to mark the 30th anniversary of his father's
death,'' publicist Stephany Todd said Friday.
   Sitkovetsky has performed widely as a soloist with Western
symphony and chamber orchestras and since 1984 has been music
director of Finland's Korsholm Festival. He made his debut with the
Cleveland Orchestra in 1986.

   Gov. Thomas H. Kean plans to buy a weekend
house in the exclusive Pottersville section of Bedminster, the heart
of New Jersey fox hunting country, his spokesman said.
   The two-floor, nine-room masonry house with a barn and pond is
located in north-central New Jersey.
   ``The governor is very much an outdoors ... type,'' spokesman
Carl Golden said Friday. ``When he saw the opportunity to purchase a
property in an area that's still rather unspoiled, he took it.''
   Pottersville is part of the Somerset Hills area, whose rambling
mansions house such well known figures as former automaker John Z.
De Lorean and magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes.
   Golden said the price and seller would not be disclosed.
   Kean's choice of quarters has drawn intense interest since his
election in 1981. He was roundly criticized several years ago for
buying an island beach property in New York's Long Island Sound at
the same time he was appearing in television commercials extolling
the attractiveness of New Jersey's Atlantic Coast resorts.

   Mother Teresa arrived in Port Elizabeth after spending three days
in Cape Town and selecting a site for a charity mission in
Khayelitsha, a black township outside that city.
   She has said she does not plan to establish any other missions on
her weeklong visit to South Africa.

   President Daniel Ortega asked the
national assembly to extend a 30-day state of emergency imposed just
before Hurricane Joan ravaged Nicaragua, state radio reported.
   Meanwhile, Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper on Friday
claimed the government botched the chance to get substantive
hurricane assistance by demanding _ rather than asking _ aid in a
crude manner.
   The newspaper La Prensa charged the Sandinistas committed ``a
great diplomatic error that cut off the aid'' by asking for ``too
much (assistance) and in a bad way'' from Managua's diplomatic corps.
   The newspaper also said some of the Sandinistas' requests
appeared targeted for the Nicaraguan army, rather than victims of
Hurricane Joan.
   Joan killed 116 people, left more than 200,000 homeless and
caused severe damage to much of the country in its rampage across
Nicaragua.
   Citing a document it said was provided by a diplomatic source,
the newspaper said government requests for field tents and certain
types of medical supplies generated suspicions the request ``was a
maneuver to supply the Sandinista army with medical resources.''
   It said the government requested 440,000 analgesic tablets, more
than 1 million serum flasks, bandages, plaster for casts, small
surgical tools and other supplies more appropriate for field
hospitals.
   La Prensa further charged that tents donated by Britain were not
given to the homeless.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters last month
that the United States feared any emergency aid it offered would
help the Sandinistas fight U.S.-supported rebels known as Contras.
   The leftist government had no immediate comment on La Prensa's
report.
   Radio Sandino on Friday reported Ortega asked the National
Assembly to extend the 30-day state of emergency imposed Oct. 20,
two days before Hurricane Joan struck.
   Ortega's request was expected to be approved in the assembly,
where the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front holds 61 of 96
seats.
   The emergency law suspended several articles of the constitution
dealing with freedom of expression.

   The second time around in the Peace Corps
is easier, say Catherine and William Derrenger, who met and married
during a stint in Sierra Leone in the 1960s and have just returned
from two years in the Fiji Islands.
   ``We had always planned on doing it again, and when our children
went off to university, we just decided to do it,'' said Mrs.
Derrenger, 47. The couple has a son who graduated from the
University of Chicago and a daughter who is a senior at Western New
England College in Springfield.
   No figures were available on Peace Corps volunteer
re-enlistments, but corps spokesman James Flanigan said from
Washington that it's happening more and more. Many of those who
volunteer a second time first joined right out of college and then
decided to return after retiring from their careers.
   ``It's a trend that's just begining to manifest itself as the
Peace Corps enters its third decade, but we have a number of people
in both categories,'' he said.
   ``The first time we were a lot younger,'' Derrenger said. ``This
time we were no less enthusiastic, but we were a lot better equipped
to really provide useful skills to the people.''
   It was more difficult the second time for the Derrengers to break
away from their everyday lives. He owned an eight-store shopping
center in Billings, Mont., and she ran a pre-school there. At the
time of their first Peace Corps tour they were newly graduated from
college. But for the second go-round neither found it hard to cast
off their possessions.
   ``It was like taking the ultimate shower. You felt so clean
afterwards,'' Derrenger said. ``I had been walking around with two
pockets full of keys and when we were through getting rid of the
stores, the house, the vehicles, and everything, we had two keys
left to the footlockers that held everything we owned.''
   Said Mrs. Derrenger: ``It's kind of fun to be starting over
again, just like our kids.
   ``When we decided to go, we got rid of everything down to the
things that we were going to pass on to the children after we died.
It took us two years to do it, but it's a marvelous, wonderful
feeling to sell everything.''
   In 1963, Mrs. Derrenger, a Chicopee native, headed to Sierra
Leone to teach in a girl's school in Segwema. Her future husband,
who grew up in South Dakota and graduated from Baylor University in
Texas, arrived in West Africa a few months later to work on a
program to build roads and a water supply in the isolated region.
   The Derrengers currently are staying with relatives in Chicopee,
near Springfield, and haven't made any definite plans.
   ``It wasn't love at first sight,'' he said, recalling how she,
with more experience, got the front seat in the truck carrying them
from the airfield, leaving him ``to breath dust and grumble for 200
miles.''
   ``It was easier this time, because we were a team and had some
life experience behind us,'' said Mrs. Derrenger. ``The first time I
taught school. The second time I trained teachers.''
   Her work in Fiji included developing a program to train 150
preschool teachers and establish 90 schools. His involved adapting a
program teaching management skills to chiefs and other tribal
leaders.
   ``It was something I thought about during the 25 years we were
back in the states,'' he said. ``The chief system is one that works
and makes sense. It just needed the application of modern management
techniques.''

directors said.
   Tajuddin Mohamed Talha of the Perak State Wildlife and National

Malaysian royalty, women and children will be watching the contest.
   Tajuddin said birds speaking Malay, the main language of

<HEAD>Palestinian Leaders Gather For Meeting Of Parliament-In-Exile</HEAD>

   More than 400 Palestinian leaders
gathered today for a meeting of the Palestine parliament-in-exile in
a session expected to result in the declaration of an independent
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A leading PLO official said the declaration would be an important
step toward establishing a Palestinian homeland in the
Israeli-occupied territories. The Israeli government, claiming the
move will only cause more violence, tightened security in the
territories.
   ``From the international, legal point of view, this (independence
declaration) will consecrate officially the identity of the West
Bank and Gaza,'' said Bassam Abu Sharif, chief spokesman for PLO
leader Yasser Arafat.
   Abu Sharif said the next step after declaration is recognition of
the Palestinian state from other nations.
   Abu Sharif met with reporters at the heavily guarded seaside
center where the Palestine National Council, the
parliament-in-exile, begins a four-day meeting today.
   Abu Sharif claimed the Israelis plan to assassinate top Palestine
Liberation Organization leaders. He said a list of intended victims
included Arafat, and that one assassination had been recently
attempted. He did not elaborate.
   In Jerusalem, Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, responded: ``The ... imagination of Bassam Abu Sharif has
apparently been working overtime in anticipation of the PNC
(Palestine National Council) and he will say anything to get a
headline.''
   Israeli officials claim an independence declaration will hurt the
Middle East peace process and incite more anti-Israeli violence in
the territories.
   ``The declaration is irrelevant,'' said a Shamir aide, Yossi Ben
Aharon. ``But to our sorrow, it will incite the population.''
   Underground Palestinian leaders called on supporters to step up
protests during the meeting. Israel on Friday closed access to the
West Bank and imposed a curfew on the Gaza Strip.
   The meeting of the 450-member council is seen as a historic
moment in Palestinian history and comes during an 11-month uprising
against Israel's 21-year occupation of the territories.
   At least 310 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died since the
uprising began Dec. 8 in the territories Israel seized from Egypt
and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Abu Sharif told reporters: ``Palestinians have a right to a
state. All other details can be negotiated.''
   ``This PNC will legislate beyond doubt the line that has been
presented by Chairman Arafat for a long time _ calling for a just
peace in the Middle East and confirming our readiness to sit down
and negotiate at an international conference,'' Abu Sharif said.
   The Palestinian meeting comes after Jordan severed its links with
the West Bank last summer and after Israeli national elections Nov.
1 that produced gains by the right, which rejects giving up any of
the occupied territories.
   In Jordan, where 1.5 million of the world's 5 million
Palestinians live, several refugees doubted their
parliament-in-exile will achieve a decisive breakthrough for a
homeland in the meetings.
   ``The PNC will talk endlessly as usual,'' said Ibrahim Abu Kheit,
87, who owns a coffee shop in the Baqaa camp north of Amman,
Jordan's capital.
   Support for the PNC meeting came from 17-year-old Ziad Naimeh.
   ``It is for our benefit, if they have positive results,'' he
said. But, ``I would not go back to live with an Israeli neighbor
even if my dad insists on returning,'' said Naimeh, whose family
fled Haifa, in what is now Israel, in the 1947-48 war.

<HEAD>Publisher: Atlanta Editor Resigned Over Control Of Washington
Bureau</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jay Smith, the publisher of The Atlanta
Constitution and The Atlanta Journal, said in an opinion page
article today that Editor Bill Kovach's resignation last week came
during a discussion over control of the Cox Enterprises Inc.
Washington bureau.
   The publisher, in today's combined editions of the newspapers,
said Kovach had wanted ``greater influence'' over the Cox Washington
bureau ``for as long as he worked at the Journal-Constitution.''
   ``Fair enough,'' Smith said. ``Then I learned about backbiting
and rumor-mongering over the bureau that didn't stop even after I
said I wanted it stopped about a year ago.''
   Smith did not go into any specifics.
   Kovach could not be reached for comment. His home telephone went
unanswered Friday night.
   A public rally was planned today to show support for Kovach.
   Last Friday, Smith said in the article, he brought up the
problems with Kovach.
   ``No sooner had I spoken than Bill replied, `I'm gone,''' Smith
said. ``I replied, `I accept.'''
   Kovach, who was Washington bureau chief for The New York Times
before he joined the Atlanta newspapers in 1986, said in announcing
his resignation that it came because of a failed effort to build ``a
set of shared values and mutual trust with the senior managers of
the company. ... ''
   Kovach was credited with injecting new energy into the papers,
and oversaw an expansion of their staffs.
   Smith said in his article today that Kovach had threatened to
resign many times in the past.
   ``It was as if there were only one permissible way to do
newspapering _ Bill's way,'' Smith said. ``And while he's good _
maybe even great in some ways _ he's not perfect. More important,
neither he or anyone else is bigger than the newspapers themselves.''
   Smith also apologized for what he called ``our family's discord''
and promised readers ``a continued quest for daily excellence,''
noting that expenditures for editorial payroll and space alloted for
news both increased in the past two years.
   The rally today was organized by author Pat Conroy, U.S. Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga., and other prominent Atlanta citizens, who took
out a full-page ad in Thursday's Journal and Constitution to
announce their ``regret'' at Kovach's departure.
   John Mashek, a member of the newspapers' Washington staff,
resigned Wednesday because of Kovach's departure.
   Cox Enterprises publishes 20 daily newspapers, including the
Atlanta newspapers, as well as weekly newspapers and a monthly
publication. The company also owns eight television stations and 11
radio stations and is the nation's fourth-largest multiple cable
system operator.

   Arab activists called for further protests
against the Israelis today as Palestinian leaders opened a summit
meeting, but Israel closed the West Bank and confined 650,000 Gaza
Strip residents to their homes.
   In the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and wounded three
Palestinians during protests Friday, hospital officials said. Two
boys aged 12 and 15 were wounded in an Arab neighborhood of
Jerusalem in shootings that were under investigation, Israel
television said.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, is
expected to declare an independent Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip during its four-day meeting beginning today in
Algiers, Algeria.
   All Gaza residents were placed under curfew as of 9 p.m. Friday,
including at least 250,000 who were confined to small concrete-block
homes in refugee camps.
   Troops standing guard at entry points to Jerusalem turned away
Arab cars from the West Bank, the military spokesman said.
   Earlier Friday, troops rounded up and detained hundreds of
Palestinians in an effort to prevent rioting during the council
meeting. Israeli television said authorities cut phone links with
many West Bank areas to further isolate them and prevent organized
activities.
   Soldiers streamed into Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods, doubling
the standing police and Border Patrol forces to 1,100 men. Police
Minister Chaim Bar-Lev said further steps would be taken as needed.
   ``If necessary, we will seal or clamp curfews on neighborhoods on
the periphery of Jerusalem,'' he said on Israeli television, using
the Arabic news program to reach Arab viewers.
   ``Saturday, Sunday and Monday will be days of escalation,'' said
leaflet No. 28 of the Palestinian leadership. ``All the strike
forces ... should escalate protest and resistance against the forces
of occupation, wherever they are in the territories.''
   The leaders called for a complete strike Tuesday, at the end of
the Palestine Council session.
   The Palestinian uprising in the territories has lasted nearly a
year and cost the lives of at least 310 Palestinians and 11
Israelis. About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the territories
Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war.
   The commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Amram
Mitzna, also used Israeli television's Arabic news to appeal to
Palestinians to ignore calls for protests.
   ``No decision from the outside ... will bring change _ it will
only make things worse,'' Mitzna said, referring to the anticipated
declaration of independence. ``I am appealing to residents ... to
avoid clashes with the security forces.''
   In the Gaza Strip Friday, troops shot and wounded three Arab men
during clashes in refugee camps, hospital officials said.
   The camps were under curfew most of the day but clashes broke out
in Jabalia camp during a temporary lifting of the restrictions,
designed to let residents shop for food, an Arab reporter said.
   Youths took to the streets to protest and hurl stones at
soldiers, the reporter said.
   A 20-year-old was shot in the left foot and a 25-year-old was
shot in the back, hospital officials said.
   In the Nusseirat camp, also in Gaza, a 27-year-old man was shot
in the leg when he violated the curfew and left his home, a hospital
official said.
   Israel television said police were investigating whether the two
Jerusalem boys were shot by a civilian who fired live ammunition at
stone-throwers who attacked his car.

Market</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A presidential ``stock market'' that required
participants to ``put their money where their mouth is'' accurately
predicted the outcome of the presidential election, the market's
originators say.
   The computerized market was established by four researchers at
the University of Iowa who wanted to see if it could outperform
opinion polls. In it, professors and students gambled cash to buy
shares of the candidates.
   After the election, share owners were paid a dividend that
depended on the fraction of the popular vote received by each
candidate. A trader could make money by accurately predicting the
outcome and then bidding to buy shares at prices below his forecast
or to sell at prices above it.
   ``In theory it's more accurate (than polls) because of the
financial incentive people have to put their money where their mouth
is,'' said one of the researchers, Robert Forsythe, an economist.
   Prices of the candidates' shares could be converted easily into
numbers showing what percentage of the public favored each
candidate, Forsythe said.
   Since shortly after the second presidential debate Oct. 13, the
stock market showed Republican George Bush with between 51.2 percent
and 53.6 percent of the vote, leading Democrat Michael Dukakis by a
margin ranging from 5.2 percent to 8 percent.
   Bush won Tuesday's election with 54 percent of the vote and by an
8-point margin.
   ``Starting Oct. 17, the market has been predicting about this
outcome all along,'' said Forsythe. ``If you look at the polls over
that period, they've been a heck of a lot more volatile.''
   Gallup polls, for example, gave Bush a 6 percent advantage early
in October, a 10 percent advantage near the end of October and a 9
percent advantage just before the election, said Coleen McMurray of
the Gallup Organization in Princeton, N.J.
   Forsythe's collaborators in the project were economists Forrest
Nelson and George Neumann and political scientist Jack Wright.
   The researchers closed the market Wednesday and are beginning to
analyze it. Nelson said they would like to continue their research
with a similar market next fall that will allow students at several
Big 10 universities to buy and sell stock in the Big 10 football
teams.
   Nelson said the stock traders' profits and losses had not been
tallied by Friday, but one trader claimed to have earned a 30
percent profit and another said he had lost $40 of $150 wagered.
Most of the 168 traders' profits and losses were probably less than
a few dollars, Nelson said.
   The market differs from polls in that it does not reflect the
traders' preferences, but rather their impressions of how well each
candidate is doing.
   Each stock trader is, in effect, a private pollster, surveying
friends and following news reports.
   The market prices respond to the information traders pick up.
Economic theory predicts that because the traders aren't being asked
their preferences, they don't have to be a representative sample of
the population to accurately reflect public opinion.
   The researchers are far from proving that the market is an
effective means of surveying public opinion, but they were
encouraged when the market did not show the wild swings in public
opinion that were registered in polls.
   Jack Ludwig, chief methodologist of the Gallup Organization, said
an educated group like the Iowa stock traders ``would be less likely
to show the kind of swings in popularity that the candidates do on a
general population basis.''
   Ludwig also said he didn't believe that the small sample of
white, educated Midwesterners could be used to estimate public
opinion nationwide.
   A potential advantage of the market over opinion polls is that it
provides a continuous record of public opinion, Forsythe said.
   John Eighmey, a senior vice president and market survey expert at
the Young and Rubicam advertising agency in New York, said he had
seen the market demonstrated and found it ``really quite intriguing
and impressive.''
   ``It's one thing to ask a person, `What do you think about this
subject?' It's quite another when they have a personal stake in the
answer,'' he said.

   Police fought young demonstrators with
batons, tear gas and water cannon as tens of thousands of people
rallied across Poland on the 70th anniversary of the rebirth of the
Polish state.
   Earlier Friday, communist authorities held their most elaborate
ceremonies to celebrate the re-establishment of Poland in 1918, when
anti-Soviet leader Jozef Pilsudski took power at the end of World
War I.
   Opposition groups organized independent marches and rallies in
the cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Krakow, Wroclaw, Lublin, Lodz, Poznan,
Tarnow and Katowice.
   But the official news agency PAP complained that protests in
several cities caused a ``dissonance in the patriotic atmosphere.
... In some cities, there were demonstrations and attempts to
disturb public order undertaken by irresponsible groups of youth,''
it said.
   Reporters watched police fire tear gas and then charge about 500
young people near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw after
demonstrators threw sticks at officers. The protesters quickly
scattered into a nearby park, but at least 10 were detained.
   The skirmish followed a torchlight march by more than 20,000
Poles chanting ``Solidarity'' and ``Independence'' in the streets of
the capital following a Mass marking the anniversary.
   An opposition spokeswoman in Gdansk said 25,000 people attended a
Mass in St. Mary's Basilica Catholic church, the country's largest
church. Afterward many tried to march but were attacked by police in
full riot gear who fired water cannon and beat demonstrators with
batons.
   Referring to plans to shut down the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk,
birthplace of the banned Solidarity union, spokeswoman Joanna
Wojciechowska said the crowd chanted defiantly: ``Lenin is yours,
the shipyard is ours.''
   The turmoil ended after Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski appealed to the
police commander to call off his troops and let the mainly youthful
protesters disperse unattacked, she said.
   In western Poznan city, a two-hour battle erupted between riot
police and 4,000 shouting, leaflet-throwing demonstrators, said
Alexandra Bessert, a Solidarity activist. She said scores of people
were detained.
   Three people were hospitalized after being beaten by police in
the southern industrial city of Katowice, said Maria Moczulska, a
spokeswoman for the Confederation for an Independent Poland. Police
also intervened after a Mass in Tarnow, opposition spokesmen said.
   People gathered peacefuly in Lodz, Wroclaw, Lublin and other
smaller cities, opposition spokesmen said.
   But after the main rally attended by 10,000 people in Krakow,
small groups of youth reportedly clashed with police after they
decided to march on the Soviet consulate.
   The Warsaw crowd packed St. John's Cathedral in the Old Town,
where Warsaw Bishop Wladyslaw Miziolek told worshipers: ``The
independence of Poland is the concern of every generation.''
   After a Mass led by boy scouts, the crowd marched down a historic
street past the restored Royal Castle to lay flowers at the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier.
   The popular demonstrations followed a day of gala celebrations
sponsored by Polish officials, including a rare televised Mass and
legions of goose-stepping soldiers in a military parade.
   It was the first time so much attention was paid to Pilsudski,
who in 1918 had just been released from a German prison at the end
of World War I.
   On Nov. 11, 1918, a civil council in Warsaw turned over military
power to Pilsudski, who proclaimed an independent Polish state and
disarmed German troops in the capital.
   The dream of generations of patriots was realized with the
re-establishment of Poland after 123 years of being partitioned
between Prussia, Austria and Russia. Nov. 11 was celebrated as
independence day before World War II but was spurned by communist
authorities after the war.
   Official attitudes toward the date have softened in the aftermath
of the 1981 declaration of martial law, with the military government
embracing popular patriotic symbols and urging unity in the name of
the ``Ojczyzna,'' the fatherland.
   On Victory Square, Polish Communist Party leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, wearing his army uniform and flanked by Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, presided at the hourlong official ceremonies.

   Penthouse magazine publisher Bob
Guccione may buy a $12 million Boardwalk tract where a casino hotel
was once proposed, a state appeals court has ruled.
   The decision Thursday was the latest ruling in nine years of
protracted litigation over the site where the Mayflower Hotel once
stood.
   Guccione became embroiled in a lawsuit with Greta and Joseph
Shamy, who were under contract to buy the hotel in 1977, according
to court papers.
   The Shamys, of Galloway Township, and Guccione had agreed to form
a corporation to buy the property and develop a new casino hotel.
But the Shamys sued for breach of contract in 1979 following a
business dispute.
   Seven years later, after numerous court hearings, a Superior
Court judge ordered the property placed in receivership and sold to
a competitive bidder.
   Guccione's attorney, Henry N. Luter of Morristown, said Guccione
and an investment group put together by the Shamys made separate
offers.
   The court-appointed receiver, Arthur M. Greenbaum, recommended
that the property be sold to Guccione for $12 million, the amount he
had already invested in the property, according to court papers. The
Shamys appealed that recommendation.
   But in a decision released Thursday, Judges Herman D. Michels and
John D. Keefe of the Appellate Division of Superior Court affirmed
the receiver's recommendation.

   The dollar spiralled downward, depressing stock
prices for the biggest daily loss on Wall Street since April and
reflecting concerns about how President-elect George Bush will
manage the economy.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
lost 47.66 points Friday to finish at 2,067.03. That gave the
blue-chip indicator a net loss of 78.77 points for the week, the
steepest election-week decline since the 1948 victory of President
Harry S. Truman.
   The dollar stood at a 10-month low against the Japanese yen and
at five-month lows against the West German mark and British pound.
   Dealers noted that efforts Friday by the central banks of several
nations to halt the dollar's slide failed.
   ``It was not enough,'' said Gary Taratunio, a trader at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Central banks typically try to halt a drop in the dollar's value
by buying large amounts of dollars on their domestic exhanges.
   ``The whole market is waiting to test the resolve of the central
banks, and given that, unless there is strong intervention or policy
statements by the new Bush cabinet, the dollar will continue to
slide,'' Taratunio added.
   The dollar's decline heightened the concerns of investors who
spent the week worrying about interest rates, and the nation's
budget and trade deficits.
   ``The biggest concern is whether Bush will be able to work with
Congress to resolve the serious problems,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
vice president of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc., a brokerage firm.
   Most analysts predicted the stock market's bearish sentiment
would persist in the near term as investors try to sort out the
prospects for the future.
   The market started the week on a down note as nervous investors
anticipated the outcome of the presidential election. The market
gained slightly on Election Day, then slid the remainder of the week
in mostly light trading.
   Analysts said that in the post-election environment, investors
felt little conviction to commit their funds in the face of mounting
questions about how Bush will deal with the nation's twin deficits
and whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to prop up
the sagging dollar.
   With the government bond market closed for the Veterans Day
holiday and little other activity to give Wall Street impetus, stock
prices tracked the eroding dollar.
   Statements made in Europe by George Gould, a U.S. Treasury
official, and U.S. Commerce Secretary William Verity indicated there
is support for the dollar at its current, depressed levels. A lower
dollar means U.S. products are cheaper abroad.
   Gould said in London that while the stock market has to seek its
own level, ``we, as a matter of policy, have no interest in seeing
the dollar lower.''
   John Lipsky, director of international bond research at Salomon
Brothers, said: ``We are near the point where unless there is some
policy action, the market will decide that a new, lower level of the
dollar will not be resisted. There is little doubt that we are going
to have a clear test of United States policy intentions regarding
the dollar.''
   On Friday, declining stocks outnumbered advancers by about 4-1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,235 issues down, 292 up, and 414 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 135.50 million shares, up
from 128.92 million in the previous session, with many market
participants away for the holiday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 159.74 million shares.

   The furor over a Kristallnacht speech
made by the parliament president, who resigned under intense
criticism, reveals West Germans' lingering sensitivity to the Nazi
past.
   The address by Bundestag President Philipp Jenninger prompted
charges that some Germans have not honestly faced up to what
occurred under Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, including the
extermination of 6 million Jews.
   ``The background of what happened is the inability of many
Germans to stand up to their own past,'' the leftist Greens party
said before Jenniger, a conservative Christian Democrat, resigned
Friday.
   In his speech Thursday marking the 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht when Nazi thugs attacked Jews, Jenninger attempted to
set the scene of Germany in the 1930s when Hitler came to power,
saying Germans initially found the Nazi era ``glorious.''
   Jenninger says the speech was misunderstood and that he is an
``uncompromising foe of every type of totalitarian rule.''
   Both West Germany and communist East Germany devoted themselves
this week to decrying Kristallnacht, or Crystal Night, of Nov. 9-10,
1938, the prelude to the Holocaust. The night was named for the
shards of glass that littered streets after Nazis smashed and burned
Jewish business, homes and synagogues.
   West German President Richard von Weizsaecker has insisted
Germans bore full responsiblity for the Nazi era and warned against
any attempts to play down its horrors.
   ``Nothing that historical science brings to light today can
diminish the crimes of the Nazi era,'' Weizsaecker said last month.
   The East German government has also denounced the Nazi years but
rejects responsibility for Nazi crimes, they say, because the crimes
occurred before the 1949 founding of the communist country. West
Germany was founded the same year.
   For all their well-intentioned effort, the remembrances of
Kristallnacht this week went awry with Jenninger's speech.
   Jenninger recalled that many Germans in the 1930s at first felt
Hitler brought them ``glorious times.''
   His address ignited a storm of protest _ at home and abroad.
   Politicians across the political spectrum called for Jenninger to
resign.
   Angry responses came from Israel and from Jewish leaders in the
United States.
   East Germany's official news agency ADN called the Jenninger
speech ``a scandal.''
   Newspapers reported Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a close friend of
Jenninger, called him to the office to criticize him for the
emotionless tone of the speech.
   The leftist Greens said Jenninger's speech showed that despite
the passage of 43 years, many West Germans still have not
sufficiently come to grips with what happened under Hitler's rule.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the opposition Social Democrats, said,
``This event shows us how the darkest chapter of German history is
still a present-day thing.''
   In New York, Morris Abram, chairman of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said: ``Speaker
Jenninger, regardless of his intentions, was guilty of insensitivity
to that which can never be forgotten or forgiven.''
   But many observers rushed to his side, pointing to Jenninger's
record as a steadfast supporter of Israel. Also, no one questioned
his assertions that he is anti-Nazi.
   The conservative daily newspaper Die Welt in today's editions
said Jenninger's main error was the tone of his speech could have
given the impression he had ``found a way to understand the
developments of 50 years ago'' without balancing that against
harsher criticism of the Nazi era.
   The controversy is likely to keep West Germans thinking about how
best to deal with recollections of the Nazi years, the newspaper
said.
   ``The reasons for the fast plummet of the second-ranking official
in our country will be occupying us for a long time,'' Die Welt said.
   A leader of West Germany's Jewish community Thursday defended
Jenninger's speech.
   ``I welcome that the Parliament president described in full
clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938,'' said
Michael Fuerst, a deputy chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
West Germany.
   ``Especially the fact that everything that Hitler did was
strongly supported by the masses of all Germans,'' Fuerst said.
   But Friday, Jewish council chairman Heinz Galinski was quoted as
disavowing his deputy's comments.
   ``No one is supporting him. That's shown by the numerous protests
that have reached me from all Jewish communities,'' the Neue Presse
of Hanover quoted Galinski as saying.
   The newspaper also quoted Galinski as saying Fuerst might lose
his job.

<HEAD>Gulf Crash Kills 3, U.S. Toll In Region Reaches 49</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials said today that
investigators are trying to determine why a U.S. Navy helicopter
crashed, killing all three crewmen, while preparing to land aboard a
warship in the north Arabian Sea.
   The pre-dawn crash Friday was the seventh involving American
military aircraft in the Persian Gulf region, with a total of 12
dead, durin 19 months of U.S. naval operations to protect commercial
shipping caught in the Iraq-Iran war.
   The overall U.S. casualty toll during that time is 49, including
37 aboard the missile frigate USS Stark, mistakenly hit by Iraqi
missiles in May 1987.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the SH-2F
anti-submarine helicopter crashed while making a routine landing
approach to the frigate USS Barbey.
   ``They were coming in toward the ship, they called in and said
they had some kind of a problem, and then the helo (helicopter) just
went down and hit the water,'' said one official.
   The aircraft apparently sank immediately because boats and other
helicopters from the Barbey, the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and the
missile cruiser USS California were unable to find any survivors or
wreckage, the official said.
   He said names of the crew were being withheld pending
notificationof next of kin.
   The three ships are part of the U.S. carrier battle group now
operating in the Arabian Sea, in support of U.S. forces inside the
gulf.
   The investigation will be conducted by the headquarters of Naval
Air Pacific at San Diego, where the Barbey and the helicopter
squadron are based.
   In addition to the three presumed dead in Friday's crash, the
overall crash toll includes two U.S. Marine pilots killed when their
AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship was lost, apparently due to hostile
action by Iran, last April 18 and five killed in two helicopter
mishaps last year in the Persian Gulf.
   The other two killed were pilots of a Navy carrier jet that
crashed in the Arabian Sea during a training flight.

   Videotapes of a man accused of
killing his daughter show him assuming the voices of ``Satan,'' his
dead grandmother and some other of the 10 personalities that a
psychiatrist says he diagnosed.
   A jury that began watching the videotapes Friday saw a hypnotized
Thomas Lee Bonney tremble with grief and pound his fist on a table
as he insisted that his daughter, Kathy Carol Bonney, 19, was not
dead.
   Bonney is charged with shooting his daughter 27 times.
   In one videotape, Bonney said his daughter visits him in jail.
   ``Most nights, she'll come in here to see me, after everybody
else goes to sleep, and we'll talk,'' a weeping Bonney said.
   Watching the videotape Friday, Bonney frowned and looked puzzled
at what he saw. Outside the courthouse, he said the man in the
videotapes was not him.
   ``Everybody's got a twin in the world,'' the Chesapeake, Va., man
said. ``I guess I've got one, too.''
   Bonney, 45, who is being held in a jail, is charged with
first-degree murder in his daughter's death. Her nude body was found
last November next to the Dismal Swamp Canal, just inside North
Carolina's border with Virginia.
   ``Satan'' and three other of Bonney's 10 purported personalities
revealed themselves in 23 hours of videotaped interviews with Dr.
Paul F. Dell, a psychiatry professor at Norfolk's Eastern Virginia
Medical School.
   Dell's testimony is key to Bonney's defense that he is innocent
by reason of insanity. If convicted, he could be sentenced to death.
   Superior Court Judge Paul M. Wright viewed portions of the tapes
Thursday and ruled they could be shown to the jury.
   Dell, in his testimony, said Bonney's memory problems and
inconsistent stories are the result of multiple personalities. In
the video the jury saw Friday, Bonney could not remember his height,
his age, or the name or phone number of his old businesses.
   ``It is the switching and struggles among his alternate
personalities that is producing his strange and inconsistent
behavior,'' Dell said.
   On one tape, Bonney's voice took on a demonic snarl as he was
interviewed.
   ``You're just a mortal,'' Bonney growled, eyebrows arched, long
fingernails clicking on a tabletop. ``You don't know nothing.''
   During other interviews, Bonney assumed the feeble voice of
Mammy, his long-dead maternal grandmother, and called out for Kathy
Bonney.
   ``Can you hear me, Kathy?'' Bonney said in his grandmother's
voice. ``I'm so old, so old. But I gotta fix supper. Maybe you'll
change your mind. Eat some supper now.''
   ``She ain't supposed to be living in here,'' the Satan voice
interrupted, referring to Bonney's dead daughter. ``She won't be in
here long. She called me a bastard.
   ``The gun went off. ... She was sitting there screaming, and I
was hollerin'. And I said, `What are you gonna do?' And she said,
`I'm gonna shoot you, you bastard.'
   ``I know everything,'' the Satan voice continued. ``I am strong.
I can do what I want to, when I want to. I control Tom. He's dumb
... a wimp ... a goody-goody, talking that Jesus garbage all the
time.''
   Suddenly ``Viking'' spoke up, a noble, friendly personality and
the first to reveal itself during Bonney's evaluation by Dell.
   ``He's gonna shoot her!'' Viking screamed excitedly, apparently
reliving the night Ms. Bonney died. ``He's gonna shoot her! No! No!
I've got to protect her! Don't shoot her! I love her.''
   Ms. Bonney had argued with her father on a darkened roadside
about a love letter to a married boyfriend, whom ``Satan'' called
``that stupid newt.'' Then, according to the Satan personality, Ms.
Bonney ``called (Satan) a bastard. She sorta goofed when she called
him that.''
   ``She thought she was talking to Tom,'' Satan said. ``But she was
talking to me.''

   The Soviet Union today detonated a 20-kiloton
nuclear test device beneath the Semipalatinsk proving grounds on the
steppes of Kazakhstan in Soviet Central Asia, the official news
agency Tass reported.
   Twenty kilotons, the force of 20,000 tons of TNT, was the yield
of the U.S. atom bomb dropped in 1945 on Hiroshima, Japan.
   ``The goal of the testing was upgrading military technology,''
Tass said of the 6:30 a.m. test explosion. Tass provided no further
details.
   On Oct. 18, the Soviets detonated another 20-kiloton nuclear
device at Semipalatinsk. Tass at the time said that blast was
conducted to research the physics involved in a nuclear explosion.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drug arrest of an elementary school principal
prompted city school officials to question the system that protected
him despite complaints about his job performance, drinking and drug
use.
   The spotty record of Matthew Barnwell, 55, which was never enough
to cause his removal from the principal's post at P.S. 53 in the
South Bronx, prompted School Board President Robert Wagner Jr. to
rip the principals' union.
   ``The union's pushing this guy back is a tremendous disservice to
kids,'' Wagner said. ``This case reflects why the system of
(principal) tenure to a school is very bad.''
   The union, the Council of Supervisors and Administrators,
represents 4,600 principals and other administrators.
   Barnwell pleaded innocent Friday to a misdemeanor charge of
criminal possession of a controlled substance, crack cocaine, during
arraignment in Criminal Court. He was released on his own
recognizance.
   Barnwell, the first New York City principal ever arrested on drug
charges, was scheduled to return to court Nov. 22.
   Barnwell, who will receive his $62,199 salary pending the end of
his case, was arrested a week after Schools Chancellor Richard Green
announced a drug crackdown in schools.
   His arrest Wednesday for allegedly buying two vials of crack on a
Harlem street corner sparked a review of the process that kept him
on the job for 16 years despite bad reviews and complaints.
   Michael Sofarelli, inspector general for the Board of Education,
confirmed that his office received a tip earlier this year that
Barnwell was having problems with drugs and alcohol.
   The reports said the veteran principal had nodded off in meetings
and behaved erratically, Sofarelli said. But the tip _ which came in
an anonymous letter _ was never substantiated, school officials said.
   Curtis Johnson, president of the local school board that controls
P.S. 53, told a Thursday night meeting of parents from the school
that Barnwell had undergone alcoholism counseling. And a report
published Friday in the New York Post said he also had requested
drug treatment.
   Barnwell's problems caused his temporary removal from the school
three times in the past seven years, said board member Jerome Green.
In addition, the principal twice received unsatisfactory ratings due
to absences and lateness, school officials said.
   Only one principal has been fired in the school system in the
last nine years.
   James Stein, director of the Board of Education's Office of
Appeals and Reviews, said that to get fired, ``You'd have to be an
ax murderer.''
   But union president Ted Elsberg, who stressed this was an
isolated incident, pointed out that there were never formal charges
brought against Barnwell, despite all the complaints.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An armed forces commander
rejected a call by leftist rebels to observe a truce during an
Organization of American States meeting next week, saying it was
nothing but a public relations ploy.
   ``They (the guerrillas) should not play with an entire people's
desire for pacification,'' Col. Mauricio Vargas, commander of the
3rd army brigade in the eastern province of San Miguel, said Friday.
   ``It (the announcement) is cynical and it is not ethical. Peace
is not a momentary truce. It should not be manipulated on the
international stage to give the impression that a certain will
exists where it does not in fact exist,'' said Vargas, one of the
armed forces' top colonels.
   Defense Minister Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova and Col. Rene Ponce,
head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were not immediately available
for comment on the rebel proposal.
   The OAS General Assembly meeting in the Salvadoran capital is to
run Monday through Saturday. Secretary of State George Shultz is
scheduled to attend.
   Guerrilla leaders told a Mexico City news conference Friday their
truce would run from 6 p.m. Sunday to 6 p.m. Friday. They called on
the army to observe the cease-fire.
   ``We have decided to suspend the military campaign and declare a
five-day truce during the meeting,'' said Joaquin Villalobos, a
leader of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the
umbrella organization of leftist Salvadoran rebel groups.
   Villalobos said the rebels would respond if the army attacked.
   Vargas said he would not suspend military operations in the
eastern zone.
   ``We have not entertained the idea of interrupting the
fulfillment of our constitutional duty, which is to combat those who
are killing the people,'' he said.
   ``We (soldiers) cannot speak about a truce because we are not the
aggressors. We are the object of aggression,'' he added.
   Another rebel leader, Leonel Gonzalez, proposed talks with the
Salvadoran government before presidential elections are held in
March and said the rebels would set no preconditions.
   The last meeting between government and rebel representatives was
in October 1987 in San Salvador. The guerrillas have rejected the
government's demands that they first lay down their arms.
   The insurgents began fighting the U.S.-backed government eight
years ago and more than 65,000 people have been killed, most of them
civilians.
   In a related development, the armed forces reported troops killed
19 guerrillas in three clashes Thursday. It gave few details and did
not mention casualties among government forces.

   Government prosecutors today arrested
the brother and cousin of former President Chun Doo-hwan on
corruption charges, bringing to seven the number of Chun's family
members arrested so far.
   Arrested today were Chun Kee-hwan, 59, the older brother of the
ex-president, and his cousin, Chun Woo-hwan, 55.
   The two were charged with taking bribes or diverting official
funds after forcibly taking over a major fish market with the help
of government officials loyal to the ex-president.
   The arrests were made as part of government efforts to uncover
alleged corruption and misdeeds involving Chun, his family members
and associates. The National Assembly is currently investigating
corruption allegations against Chun.
   Chun, who left office in February after a harsh seven-year rule,
has come under severe criticism for his alleged involvement in major
financial and other scandals.
   Chun has denied any wrongdoing while in office.
   Radical students have staged street protests almost daily in
recent weeks, demanding Chun's arrest. Students said they would
continue protests until their demand was met.

<HEAD>Major Airlines Eliminate Short-Term Advance-Purchase Fares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Just in time for the holidays, most major U.S. airlines are
eliminating discount fares used primarily by business travelers and
others who make their trips on short notice, airline officials said.
   Effective Tuesday, the airlines are dropping discounts on tickets
purchased three to seven days in advance. That means travelers will
have to buy their tickets at least 14 days in advance and meet other
restrictions to obtain the lowest fare to some destinations.
   Continental Airlines took the first step Nov. 4 by eliminating
one-way discount fares, which require advance purchase. Other big
carriers, including American, Northwest and United, quickly followed
suit.
   ``We are in the middle of a fare restructuring program,'' said
Ned Walker, a spokesman for Houston-based Continental. ``You will
see some fares decrease and others increase.''
   Walker said Friday night that the eliminated Continental fares
generally required seven-day advance purchase and carried a
cancellation penalty. These fares accounted for less than 5 percent
of Continental's ticket sales, he said.
   In Chicago, United Airlines said it was following Continental's
move.
   ``This is proof that the economy is strong and the carrier will
set the rates,'' United spokesman Chuck Novak said Friday.
   ``The airline still has a variety of discounts available to
generate traffic,'' Novak said. ``These `junk fares' do not produce
new revenue; they erode the revenue yield.''
   Northwest Airlines also is eliminating its one-way discount
``super-coach'' fares, which require a three-, seven- or 14-day
advance purchase, depending on the market, said spokesman Bob
Gibbons.
   Northwest followed Continental's lead ``because we have a higher
cost structure and if we can still offer a competitive fare but at a
slightly higher rate, that's better for us because it can help
recoup our higher costs,'' Gibbons said.
   Delta Air Lines spokesman Bill Berry, contacted Friday night,
would neither confirm nor deny whether the Atlanta-based airline
planned to join the discount elimination.
   ``The industry announced a couple of weeks ago that they would be
ending some discount fares and this might very well be one of them,
but I'm not certain,'' Berry said. ``But, we are not a leader in
this.''
   American Airlines, based in Fort Worth, Texas, announced
Wednesday that it was shedding its so-called junk fares beginning
Nov. 15. An American spokesman said the action was in response to
Continental's move.
   American's cheapest fares have relatively short advance-purchase
requirements and don't require the traveler to stay at the
destination over a Saturday night. The fares usually are 10 percent
to 35 percent below full coach fare.
   Last month, American quietly tried to eliminate the ``junk''
fares from a number of its routes originating in Dallas. Most of the
affected routes were to cities that low-fare Braniff Airways
formerly served from Dallas.
   American twice pulled back after Delta, its chief Dallas rival,
refused to match the move. Most recently, American delayed the plan
on Oct. 25.
   American spokesman Jim Brown said the moves by American and
Continental would be more widely felt than under American's original
proposal, because Continental dropped its junk fares in virtually
all its markets, and American matched the moves in most of those
markets.
   Walker said Continental will continue its popular ``Maxsaver''
fare, which usually requires an overnight stay and may carry a
cancellation penalty. Walker said that depending on the market, the
fare requires a seven- to 14-day advance purchase.

   Rain spread across the Plains this morning, while most of the
nation east of the Mississippi River was clear.
   Severe thunderstorms developed in parts of Oklahoma while snow
fell today in South Dakota and Minnesota.
   Hail up to the size of dimes came down during late evening
thunderstorms Friday in several Oklahoma communities, including
Oklahoma City, where 2 inches of rain produced street flooding in
some areas. Hail also was reported in the Texas Panhandle.
   Rain spread from northern Arkansas across much of Missouri and
eastern Kansas to western Iowa and eastern Nebraska. Thunderstorms
also reached into eastern Kansas and western Missouri. A
thunderstorm produced snow at Sioux Falls, S.D., where about an inch
accumulated by early this morning.
   Rain also fell from western Washington and Oregon to Northern
California. Winds gusted to 56 mph on San Juan island off northwest
Washington.
   Skies were clear in most of the East, the Rockies, and from
southwest Texas to Arizona and Southern California.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
eastern half of the central and southern Plains across the middle
and lower Mississippi Valley to the Tennessee and Ohio valleys; rain
mixed with snow in Wisconsin, Minnesota and North Dakota; and rain
in Michigan and across the northern Pacific Coast into the northern
Plateau region, with snow in the Cascades of Oregon and Washington.
   Predicted highs: 30s in northern Minnesota; 40s in New England,

<HEAD>Navy Probes Test-Firing That Riled Japanese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy said today it is investigating the
firing of 10 sand-filled practice shells by an American destroyer
near a Japanese coast guard vessel at the entrance to Tokyo Bay.
   The Foreign Ministry protested to the U.S. Embassy over the
incident Wednesday, which caused no injuries or damages.
   ``The area is not specifically designated for gunnery tests, and
because of this the Navy is investigating the test,'' said Kent
Hansen, a spokesman for U.S. Naval forces in Japan.
   The non-explosive projectiles struck the water about 300 yards
from the Uraga, a coast guard vessel, sparking the protests.
   The coast guard said it was a violation of international law for
such firing to take place in Japan's waters.
   The visiting commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, Adm.
Huntington Hardesty, apologized for the incident Friday as he made
courtesy calls on Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Foreign Minister
Sosuke Uno and other Japanese officials.
   Japanese newspapers called on the government to press the United
States on the firing, and linked it to complaints about similar
incidents on Okinawa, the southern Japanese island where 30,000 U.S.
troops are based.
   ``Speaking of targets,'' the liberal-leaning Asahi Shimbun said
in an editorial today, ``Okinawans often say that American
servicemen treat them as though they were targets.''
   The Asahi quoted the governor of Okinawa prefecture, Junji
Nishime, as blaming a recent series of accidents there on
``something wanting in the U.S. military's chain of command or a
decline of discipline.''
   On Okinawa, rifle bullets hit a civilian housing area near a
firing range in October, and after two U.S. Marine helicopters
collided in flight early this month, killing four Marines, Japanese
officials expressed concern over what would have happened if the
collision had occurred over an Okinawa town.
   ``Probing the causes of the accidents is now an urgent task,''
the Asahi editorial said. ``In a nutshell, the stationing of U.S.
troops in a manner that puts residents on needles and pins can be of
no advantage to either the United States or Japan.''
   This week's incident took place off the Boso Peninsula, which
guards the entrance to Tokyo Bay, an area busy with maritime
traffic. The Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Towers was returning
to its base at Yokosuka, which is just inside the bay's entrance,
when it held ``a brief gunnery test'' on a gun that had undergone
maintenance, the Navy spokesman said.
   ``Although the test was very limited in nature and posed no
danger to shipping, it alarmed other vessels in the general area,''
Hansen said.
   ``The Navy is looking thoroughly into the matter and sincerely
regrets it occurred,'' he said.
   Hansen said the Towers fired 10 sand-filled shells, aiming them
at the sea. Japanese press reports quoted Transport Minister
Shintaro Ishihara as saying the shells had apparently been aimed at
the Japanese coast guard vessel.

<TEXT>
   Towns in the Sinhalese heartland face
serious food shortages because of a strike by fuel workers, a
government official said today.
   Sufficient food supplies have been sent to the southern port of
Galle, but gasoline shortages have prevented distribution to other
towns in the region, Food Commissioner Graham Dissanayake said.
   About 2,500 employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corp., the island
nation's only gasoline supplier, walked off the job Monday in
response to a four-day strike called by the extremist Sinhalese
People's Liberation Front.
   Many workers still were not back on duty today.
   On Friday, Jayewardene issued an emergency decree providing for
death by hanging for people convicted of instigating strikes or
refusing to report for work in ``essential services'' sectors, such
as fuel and transportation.
   Senior officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the
decree is a deterrent and the government hopes it will not be
necessary to resort to capital punishment to stop strikes.
   The decree was the second tough measure introduced this week to
try and halt anti-government protests.
   On Wednesday, the army was given orders to shoot on sight anyone
demonstrating against the government. The day after, soldiers opened
fire on thousands of anti-government demonstrators in three southern
towns. At least 18 people were killed.
   In Colombo, soldiers continued to deliver fuel to gasoline
stations where motorists waited in line for hours.
   At tea plantations in the hills of central Sri Lanka, planters
predicted temporary shutdowns unless gasoline arrived within days.
Tea is a mainstay of Sri Lanka's economy, earning more than
one-quarter of the country's foreign exchange.
   A two-day, around-the-clock, curfew expired without being renewed
in the Sinhalese heartland today, when Jayewardene appealed to
people to refrain from supporting anti-government extremists.
   The Sinhalese president warned that if the violence did not stop,
nearly 50,000 workers would lose their jobs in the tourist industry.
   This week's strikes were the latest in a series called by the
People's Liberation Front, which the government blames for
assassinations of 550 government officials and supporters the last
15 months.
   The front is capitalizing on a Sinhalese backlash against
Jayewardene's peace overtures to Tamil insurrectionists and has
vowed it will not be satisfied until the president resigns.
   Presidential elections are scheduled Dec. 19. Jayewardene is
barred by law from seeking a third term.
   The president signed a peace accord with India last year designed
to end the Tamil separatist war that started in 1983 and has claimed
8,500 lives. The accord offered a measure of autonomy to northern
and eastern Sri Lanka, where most Tamils live, if the rebels
surrender their weapons.
   Militant Tamils say they need a separate homeland to preserve
their language, culture and Hindu faith and to combat job and
education discrimination by the majority Sinhalese community.

<HEAD>Air Force To Examine Use Of Plastics In Planes That Prompted
Complaints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force, concerned about health complaints by aerospace
workers who handle plastic-based composite materials used in the
Stealth fighter and other planes, has scheduled a symposium on the
issue, a Pentagon official said.
   Gary D. Vest, the Air Force's deputy assistant secretary for
health and safety, said in a speech and in an internal memo that
evaluation of the advanced materials was warranted, according to
published reports.
   Vest said the materials are widely used in the aerospace industry
although there is little knowledge about their possible health risks.
   Composite materials, including carbon, plastics and other
synthetics, are increasingly replacing metals in aircraft
construction to save weight, increase strength and defeat radar
detection.
   Workers at a Lockheed Corp. plant in Burbank, Calif., have gone
to court with claims that the composites have caused health problems
ranging from headaches to cancer. Results of a health inspection of
the plant last month have not been made public.
   Workers at Boeing Co. plants in the Seattle area have made
similar complaints.
   ``We have not yet made the necessary commitment to really
understanding the effects of chemicals, building and manufacturing
materials, and the processes involved with them,'' Vest said in a
speech to toxicology experts Nov. 2 in Fairborn, Ohio, home of
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
   The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is
preparing to investigate health complaints by aerospace workers, and
a similar probe may be conducted in the House.
   In a Nov. 1 memo to the surgeon general of the Air Force, Vest
requested that the Pentagon to hold a symposium in February on
composite hazards, according to Friday's issues of the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer and the Daily News of Los Angeles.
   ``The Air Force has obligations to ensure that its workers are
protected in the maintenance environment,'' the memo said. ``As a
result of recent controversy regarding the occupational health
aspects of the use of composites in the aerospace industry, I have
made a number of inquiries and concluded that there are questions
that warrant evaluation and analysis.''
   Details of the symposium are being worked out, the newspapers
reported.
   ``Composite technology is an emerging technology,'' said Air
Force Lt. June Green. ``This symposium is to ... discuss some of the
health effects, to discuss the aspects of the technology, its
implications and applications, and to get a better understanding of
what this technology will bring with it.''
   Boeing and Lockheed officials expressed interest in the symposium.
   ``We would be interested in taking a look at whatever they're
going to do. We're anxious to get any and all available
information,'' said Boeing spokesman Paul Binder.
   Lockheed spokesman Rich Stadler said: ``I'd say it sounds like
something we would be interested in taking part in.''

<HEAD>Dalai Lama Protests China's Arrest Of 20 Monks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The office of the Dalai Lama, spiritual
and temporal leader of Tibetans, says Chinese authorities arrested
20 monks entrapped by a questionnaire asking if Chinese officials
should be removed from Tibet.
   ``We wish to express our deep concern at what appears to be a new
form of intimidation which has been introduced in Tibet,'' said the
letter Friday to the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi.
   A Chinese diplomat said today the letter had been forwarded to
Beijing but she could not say whether its allegations were true.
   The letter issued by the Dalai Lama's office said the monks were
arrested earlier this month ``after they had the courage to state
their true feelings'' in the questionnaire.
   The letter said Chinese officials conducted the survey, using the
name of Beijing University and the Tibetan Educational Research
Center.
   It said the last time such a questionnaire was used was 1959,
shortly before an abortive uprising against Chinese rule that forced
the Dalai Lama to flee to India in 1959.
   China invaded Tibet in 1949 and annexed it a year later.
   The letter said the questionnaires sent to lamas, or monks,
sought detailed information about their families and views on
political issues.
   The list of 100 questions included ones that were ``clearly
intended to be used as a tool for propaganda and intimidation,'' the
letter said. The examples included:
   ``Do you hope that all the Chinese officials be removed from
Tibet?
   ``Do you hope to have the Dalai Lama as the leader of the Tibetan
government?''
   The Dalai Lama says he is willing to talk with Chinese officials
about the future of his homeland.
   ``It is very disturbing that this new measure should have been
introduced in Tibet at a time when His Holiness the Dalai Lama is
making every effort to promote a peaceful solution to the tragic
issue of Tibet,'' the letter said.
   Last June he proposed the creation of ``a self-governing
democratic entity'' in Tibet that would let China retain troops on
Tibetan soil and conduct Tibet's foreign policy.
   That was a major concession, but a Chinese statement called it an
insufficient basis for talks because the Dalai Lama had not
relinquished the concept of an independent Tibet.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is trying to
break resistance to reform by centralizing political power through
new laws and constitutional changes that are ``tantamount to a
coup,'' says dissident scientist and human-rights campaigner Andrei
D. Sakharov.
   The new laws will set back the trend toward glasnost, or greater
openness in the Soviet Union, Sakharov said Friday at a meeting with
Helsinki Watch, the organization founded 10 years ago to monitor
human rights in Soviet-bloc countries.
   A package of changes in the Soviet Constitution that was drawn up
without public debate ``is an attempt by Gorbachev to retain enough
power to break the resistance to reforms by the apparatus,''
Sakharov said.
   ``It looks like he was faced with the necessity to get all the
power in his hands,'' he said.
   ``I believe he is doing it with good intentions,'' the
67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner continued. ``Nonetheless, I
consider it a dangerous development.''
   Sakharov, who also spoke Friday to a packed reception at the New
York Academy of Sciences, has been an outspoken critic of Gorbachev
as well as his most distinguished supporter.
   ``The change in our personal situation was part and parcel of
general change in conditions in our country,'' said the physicist,
who was in internal exile in the closed city of Gorky with his wife,
Yelena Bonner, until they were freed by Gorbachev two years ago.
   Sakharov was banished in 1980 for opposing the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan.
   ``It's with great hope and a lot of excitement all of us are, but
unfortunately with a lot of fear as well ... watching the process
unfold,'' Sakharov said through an interpreter.
   He told the Academy of Sciences gathering that there is a saying
going around among Moscow intellectuals: ``Let's not pamper
Gorbachev.''
   ``I think that postulate and the meaning they inject into it is
wrong,'' Sakharov said. ``Gorbachev should be helped, but critically.
   ``It refers, obviously, not just to Gorbachev personally, but to
all of the processes taking place in our country as well,'' he added.
   ``One should not think that all the problems have been already
solved. On the contrary, very many of them remain.''
   He said some of the changes taking place in the Soviet Union are
``dangerous and complicated.''
   ``Many laws which are being adopted ... are a step backwards in
reality,'' Sakharov said.
   In response to a question about whether Western banks should make
unrestricted loans to the Soviet Union, Sakharov said, ``The West
should be afraid not of the success of perestroika but of its
possible failure.''
   Perestroika is the Russian term for Gorbachev's policy of
restructuring.
   ``The victory of reactionary forces ... would mean not merely a
return to the era of stagnation ... (but) we wouldn't have money for
social programs, for glasnost. However, for the buildup of our
military, they would find the funds anyway.''
   Sakharov, who is making his first trip to the West, arrived in
the United States on Sunday, and spent several days with his wife's
children outside Boston.
   On Thursday, he officially received the 1973 Human Rights Award
from the International League for Human Rights at a private
Manhattan reception.
   He plans to travel to Washington to visit President Reagan in the
White House on Monday and attend a board meeting of the
International Foundation for the Survival and Development of
Humanity, a Moscow-based group of which he is a director.

   West Germany will donate $11.4 million for victims
of an earthquake that killed more than 900 and left 200,000 homeless
in southwest China, a spokesman said today.
   Wolfgang Bockhold, spokesman for the West German Embassy, said it
was not clear whether the aid would come in the form of money or
goods.
   China's Civil Affairs Ministry said the governments of Japan and
Switzerland expressed interest in helping victims of Sunday's quake,
which measured 7.6 on the Richter scale.
   The ministry told U.N. relief agencies China will welcome such
emergency supplies as antibiotics, syringes, portable X-ray
equipment, jeeps, plastic sheets, tents, clothing and canned food.
   The quake struck a remote mountainous area of Yunnan province
near China's border with Burma, killing more than 930 people and
injuring 3,364.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage.

<HEAD>Pop-Eyed Bug Is World's Oldest Insect, Scientists Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pop-eyed bug believed to be the world's oldest
insect, discovered almost by accident in a chunk of mud, suggests
that insects may have originated millions of years earlier than once
thought, scientists say.
   To the uninitiated, the fossil looks like two small specks.
   But to paleozoologist Conrad Labandeira and colleagues, the bug
found on the north shore of Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec, Canada, is
the oldest known insect, dating back some 390 million years.
   The finding is reported in Friday's issue of the journal Science,
which describes remarkably well-preserved fragments of a wingless
bug belonging to the most primitive order of insects and similar to
the modern-day silverfish.
   Even more significant than the fossil's age, scientists say, is
its similarity to modern bugs, which suggests that insects
originated many millions of years before the specimen lived.
   ``What we have is two fragments. We have a head capsule .7
millimeters wide and we have a thorax 1 millimeter long,'' said
Labandeira, a 38-year-old graduate student at the University of
Chicago.
   ``Even though they're separate, we're very convinced that they
belong to the same individual,'' he said Friday.
   The fossil was found by Francis Hueber, a noted Smithsonian
Institution paleobotanist, who retrieved the specimen about five
years ago while examining a mud sample he found on the Gaspe
Peninsula.
   Its importance was only recently discovered when he and other
scientists compared notes.
   Hueber's interest was in prehistoric plant fragments in the dirt,
but what looked like ancient insect parts caught his eye.
   ``He had an idea that there was something very important'' about
the fragments, Labandeira said.
   Through sophisticated dating techniques, Hueber ``determined that
it was an early arthropod and probably an insect,'' said Bret Beall,
a scientist at Chicago's Field Museum who has been working with the
specimen.
   ``He knew that if this was an insect fossil it would be very
significant,'' Beall said.
   Hueber gave the specimen to Beall, who _ with Labandeira's help _
determined that it was in fact a bug and what they believe is the
world's oldest known insect.
   It lived 390 million to 392 million years ago and the scientists
say it predates by about 15 million years what previously was
believed to be the oldest insect _ represented by an eye fragment
found in upstate New York.
   The bug's most imposing features are two disproportionately large
eyes on each side of its head. It also had two antennae and two
armlike appendages that appear to have been equipped with sensors to
detect odors and vibrations.
   ``The significance is that they have a head, so it's really a
clincher that there were insects at that time,'' said William Shear,
a biology professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, where the
New York specimen is being studied.
   ``The exciting thing to me is that these insects have changed
very little as far as we know in almost 400 million years,'' Shear
said. ``That suggests that they were almost already modern in form
400 million years ago, that they had a long history before that,''
he said.
   The newly discovered fossil eventually will be sent to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington for its permanent collections,
Labandeira said.

<HEAD>Parades, Speeches Mark Veterans Day; Reagan Calls Vietnam War `Just
Cause'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   America paused to honor its veterans with a multitude of parades,
speeches, award ceremonies and quiet moments to remember the
thousands who lost their lives in the fight for freedom.
   In Marysville, Wash., a mother wiped tears from her eyes as she
buried the remains of a son whose plane was lost over Vietnam in
1967.
   An 88-year-old World War I veteran in Florida attended a memorial
service planned by officials who had thought he was dead.
   And in Kansas City, Kan., red, white and blue ballons were set
free during the dedication of a Korean-Vietnam Veterans Memorial,
thought to be the first combined memorial to honor those who died in
the two conflicts.
   At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, President Reagan
paid tribute Friday to the 58,000 killed in that war and said, ``In
our hearts you will always be young.''
   Several thousand people gathered on the Mall to face the polished
black granite memorial, including several men wearing military
jackets and some in wheelchairs, who heckled Reagan during his
speech.
   ``What I can say to our Vietnam vets is `welcome home,''' the
president said. He added that despite the divisions in America over
the war, ``who can doubt that the cause for which our men fought was
just?''
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, left a note addressed to ``our young
friends'' at the base of the memorial.
   Earlier, Reagan presented a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at
Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.
   A Veterans Day parade in New York City failed to draw many
spectators but did manage to draw attention to the fact that many of
the city's homeless are veterans, officials said.
   ``Too many of our veterans are homeless. And that's our shame,''
said Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, a World War II
Marine.
   In Jackson, Miss., more than 100 former prisoners of war were
presented with medals in a ceremony at the Mississippi War Memorial
Building.
   ``It came late, but better late than never,'' said Cecil C.
Hegwood, 74, a former Marine who was held for 40 months by the
Japanese in the Philippines.
   Air Force Capt. Robert H. Peason was buried in his hometown of
Marysville, Wash., on Friday. Pearson's remains were returned to
this country last summer by the Vietnamese, and positive
identification was made last month.
   ``It's a relief and a big weight off my shoulders,'' said his
mother, Betty Pearson. ``He's home. That's the biggest relief.''
   An Air Force spokesman said Pearson's F-4 Phantom jet had been
escorting a bomber when it collided with another plane in 1967.
   Georgia dedicated its first memorial to Vietnam veterans, a
bronze sculpture near the Capitol in Atlanta.
   In Honolulu, retired U.S. Navy submariner Ralph Adams recalled
how he helped rescue five airmen shot down in two planes 44 years
ago about 70 miles off Osaka, Japan. One of the men was George Bush.
   ``Sure, I'm proud of that,'' said Adams, 76. ``I'm happy that at
the same time we also rescued four other guys.''
   And in North Miami, Fla., Elmer Smith, an 88-year-old World War I
veteran, showed up at the city veterans monument for what originally
was intended to be a posthumous memorial service for him.
   Smith, wearing his uniform and medals as participants laid
wreaths and played taps in honor of the day, joked about the mistake.
   ``I don't know how it came about, but I'm making the most of
it,'' Smith said. ``I'm glad to be alive and around.''

   A Continental Airlines worker told police he
fell asleep while loading baggage into a plane and was locked in the
baggage compartment when it took off from Newark International
Airport.
   The Boeing 747 made a U-turn after crew members heard banging
from the baggage section and the jet was back at the airport 10
minutes later, said Lt. Frank Kraft of the Port Authority police.
   ``He dozed off. That's what he told our police,'' Lloyd Schwalb,
a Port Authority police spokesman, said Friday.
   The baggage handler, 22-year-old Darrin Jones of Newark, left the
plane on his own and was discharged from Elizabeth General Medical
Center after an examination. ``He was fine,'' said hospital
spokesman Doug Harris.
   The baggage compartment is heated and pressurized, said Ned
Walker, a Continental spokesman at the airline's Houston
headquarters.
   Walker said records indicated it was the first time an employee
became stuck in a baggage compartment. ``We will certainly look into
circumstances surrounding this isolated incident,'' he said.
   After Jones got off the plane, Flight 383 took off again for
Chicago without any problem, Walker said.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Promises to Change Law Defining Who Is A Jew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir promised four
religious political parties his Likud bloc would change a law
defining who is a Jew, if they join Likud in a new government.
   The leader of the right-wing Likud bloc made the pledge Friday,
despite vocal opposition by Jewish leaders in the United States and
other countries who object to amending the law and say that would
divide the Jewish people.
   The controverisal law defines who is recognized as Jewish by
Israel and it automatically confers citizenship on Jews who emigrate
to Israel.
   The proposed ammendment says immigrants converted to Judaism by
Reform or Conservatives rabbis would not be regarded as Jews by
Israeli authorities and woud be ineligible for citizenship. The
ammendment would only honor conversions conducted by Orthodox rabbis.
   ``Prime Minister Shamir told the religious parties he is sure he
can pass the law within three months of the new government,'' said
Shamir spokesman Yossi Achimeir. ``It's not ideal, but the silent
majority (of Jews abroad) will accept it with understanding,''
Achimeir said.
   Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member parliament in the Nov. 1
elections _ more than the left-leaning Labor party's 39 seats but
not enough to form a majority.
   Although the right-wing party has the support of three far-right
parties, which together carry seven seats, it still needs the
support of the religious bloc's 18 seats to form a majority.
   Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas
Party, said Friday that Likud's promise satisfied him and he favored
joining the Likud government. ``It is possible to say we got a
satisfying answer,'' Peretz said Friday afternoon.
   Jews abroad, the majority of whom are not Orthodox, have been
vocal in their opposition to the amendment. The amendment has
tremendous symbolic meaning by implying the the non-Orthodox streams
of Judaism are not legitimate.
   However, Achimeir said the change in legislation would have
little practical effect.
   ``Even without the change in the law the (non-Orthodox Jews) do
not come to live in Israel by the masses,'' Achimeir said. ``The
majority who come are the Orthodox Jews.''
   Shamir also met Friday with the National Religious Party and the
ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel and Degel Hatorah parties. Rabbi
Avraham Ravitz of Degel said he was pleased by Shamir's pledge.
   The National Religious Party already is supporting Likud.
   Other religious parties are scheduled to meet with President
Chaim Herzog next week to make recommendations for the prime
minister's post. Herzog will then ask the party leader most likely
to form a coalition to head the next government.

<HEAD>Muddle at Met in Season's First `Carmen'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a cockeyed ``Carmen'' at the Metropolitan
Opera: the tenor who should have been on stage spent the night in
the orchestra pit, and the soprano who sang a supporting role far
outshone the female lead.
   But Georges Bizet's masterpiece has survived far worse treatment
than it received Friday night in the season's first performance of a
production created 2{ years ago by Sir Peter Hall for his wife,
mezzo-soprano Maria Ewing.
   Her performance as the fiery gypsy who refuses to give up her
freedom received mixed reviews at the time and she is no longer
appearing in the production.
   In her place was Argentinean mezzo Alicia Nafe, making her Met
debut. Despite a pleasant voice, she did not make much of an
impression in the cavernous house, lacking the power and vocal
thrust to bring Carmen's many haunting melodies to life. In the
pivotal Card Scene of Act 3, when Carmen learns she is doomed, the
voices of fellow gypsies Frasquita and Mercedes all but drowned her
out.
   By contrast, Cheryl Studer, a soprano from Michigan making her
debut as Micaela, established herself immediately as a major artist.
She could throttle up the volume with ease without sounding harsh or
strident, and it's no surprise that she has been performing major
Wagnerian roles in leading opera houses. Let's hope the Met puts her
to better use soon.
   Now to the tenors. Gary Lakes, a hulking Texan who sang a
first-rate Siegmund in Wagner's ``Die Walkuere'' last year, was a
rough, unidiomatic Don Jose. At this point in his career he simply
lacks the grace _ vocal or physical _ to carry off the role of the
naive soldier who falls fatally in love with Carmen.
   And all the while, a few feet away with a baton in his hand was
one of the world's foremost Don Joses _ Placido Domingo, who is
developing a second career as a conductor as insurance against the
day when his tenor voice fades.
   The problem is that at this point he is still a great tenor but
not a great conductor. He put the orchestra through its paces
conscientiously but failed to bring out much of the passion or
pessimism of this wondrous score.
   The fourth major character, the dashing toreador Escamillo, was
sung by another debutant, French baritone Jean-Philippe Lafont. He
proved a lively performer, but like most baritones who attempt this
role, he couldn't do justice to the low notes of the famous
``Toreador Song.''
   The production, with sets and costumes by John Bury, has its
strong points, especially Act 3, a striking depiction of the
smuggler's mountain hideout.
   This ``Carmen'' will undergo numerous cast changes as the season
wears on. Some later peformances will star Marilyn Horne in the
title role, and Mirella Freni will sing Micaela twice.

   The Canada-U.S. free trade agreement could be
called off after the Nov. 21 Canadian election. Toronto bureau chief
Soll Sussman spent two days on the road with opposition leader John
Turner's campaign and filed this report.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader John Turner, on what he
calls the crusade of a lifetime to halt the Canada-U.S. free trade
agreement, is whipping up campaign fervor with his attacks and
clearly loving it.
   For him, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney sold out Canada and became
the ``head waiter at the White House'' by signing the pact with
President Reagan in January.
   At a Liberal Party rally, a crowd of about 2,300 howled in
approval when Turner imitated the prime minister, saluting and
saying ``Yes, sir!'' to every one of Reagan's requests.
   Mulroney wants to be ``governor of the 51st state,'' Turner says.
Turner wants to be the prime minister of Canada.
   ``This election is a referendum on Canada's future,'' Turner
repeats at nearly every stop on his campaign for the Nov. 21 vote.
   The potent, single-minded message of Canadian nationalism has
revived the Liberals' campaign and put them in a dead heat with
Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party, which won by a landslide
in 1984.
   It wasn't very long ago that Liberal rallies were attracting
handfuls of loyal supporters, not standing-room-only crowds.
   ``I can sense the momentum; I can sense it,'' the exuberant,
silver-haired Turner yelled to his London audience. A rock band
played repeatedly the ``Go Johnny Go'' refrain of Chuck Berry's
``Johnny B. Good.''
   When the campaign began in October, polls showed the Liberals
could slip to third place behind Mulroney and the socialist New
Democratic Party led by Ed Broadbent.
   But a poll published Thursday in the Globe and Mail indicated the
Liberals were leading with 37 percent support, compared to 35
percent for the Conservatives and 24 percent for the New Democrats.
The poll, by the Environics Research Group, had a margin of error of
2.7 percent.
   Perhaps in a mark of Turner's increased popularity, hecklers now
appear at almost every stop to shout out that he is misrepresenting
the free trade agreement. At London, in southeastern Ontario, most
were business students from the University of Western Ontario.
   Only a Conservative majority will ensure the survival of the free
trade agreement, which would eliminate tariffs between the United
States and Canada over a 10-year period beginning Jan. 1.
   The Liberals and the New Democrats oppose the deal, which has
already been approved by the U.S. Congress. It can't take effect
until Canada's Parliament also approves it.
   Mulroney argues that the pact is needed to guarantee Canadian
access to U.S. markets at a time of rising international
protectionism.
   Turner argues that the agreement is too drastic a break from 120
years of Canadian history marked by resistance to pressures from the
giant neighbor to the south.
   He insists he does not oppose free trade and is not
anti-American, but says the pact simply gives away too much by not
recognizing the huge discrepancy in size and economic power between
Canada and the United States.
   On the campaign trail, he talks about preserving ``the Canadian
way _ not somebody else's way; not the American way.''
   Turner stopped at farms to dramatize his message that Canadian
farmers, with their long winters and short growing seasons, would be
harmed by open competition with their southern counterparts.
   He visited an auto parts plant and espoused his view that Canada
would be better served by taking a sector-by-sector approach to
trade _ such as the auto pact with the United States that has fueled
Ontario's prosperity _ rather than agreeing to one sweeping deal.
   Mulroney says his opponents are ``scare mongering'' with false
and irrational arguments that the agreement would force Canada to
modify its system of strong social and health protection for its
people.
   Canada and the United States already form the world's biggest
two-nation trading partnership with more than $130 billion a year
passing between them.
   Opponents of the free trade agreement note that 80 percent of the
trade already is tariff-free.
   The deal's supporters, however, respond that it is deceptive to
speak of it as affecting only the remaining 20 percent of current
trade because they say the agreement will fuel growth to previously
unimaginable levels.

   Eight men posing as plainclothes police officers

   Once inside, they drew pistols, gagged and bound his wife and two

guarded the women, while the others went with Pinna to his nearby
store and forced him to open the safe, authorities said.
   The eight escaped.

   Recent floods at a wildlife reserve in

two elephants and two tigers, an Indian news agency reported
Saturday.
   The floods also killed 69 wild pigs, 28 badgers, 10 porcupines
and three wild buffaloes, Press Trust of India said, quoting an

   PTI quoted officials as saying there is a proposal to create
high-ground refuges for the animals at the Kaziranga Wildlife

   The park, on the banks of the Brahmaputra River, is famed for its
herd about 1,000 rare one-horned rhinoceroses who were facing
extinction before the animal sanctuary was established in 1926.
   Legend says that when medieval traveler Marco Polo saw the rhinos
on his way to China, he thought they were the unicorns of mythology.

   Police are looking for a man who ripped off at
least nine people in a carefully crafted swindle in which he posed
as a doctor and used fake cashier's checks to buy $150,000 in
jewelry.
   ``He's cool, calm and collected,'' said Tampa police Detective
Leroy Black. ``I've seen a lot of scams, but this one is brilliant.''
   The con artist dressed in a white doctor's coat, gave out cards
identifying himself as Victor H. Hernandez, M.D., and met his
victims in hospital lobbies, police say.
   He looked 45 to 55 years old, with dark hair edged with gray,
glasses and an expensive suit.
   One couple needing to raise money placed a classified ad to sell
31 pieces of jewelry. A man responded to the ad and arranged to meet
them in the lobby of St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa.
   ``He said he was due in surgery. And sure enough, in a few
minutes, his name came over the intercom,'' said the 50-year-old
woman, whose name was not released.
   The doctor gave the couple a cashier's check for $17,000 and
hustled off to surgery. The check bounced.
   The man conned four other victims at the same hospital in one
hour. At Sarasota Memorial Hospital, he scammed four people in three
hours. His last hit was Oct. 24 in Sarasota.
   ``What better scenario for this guy _ a hospital!'' said Stephen
Karekos, 54, who sold a gold Rolex watch to finance home remodeling.
``I tell you, this guy looked like a doctor.''
   Greg Becker, a Tampa salesman, sold two rings for $3,000.
   ``If you saw this guy, you'd think he's a doctor,'' Becker said.
``I'm not embarrassed by it. This guy was just too good.''

<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 68 days, Ronald Reagan will turn over the
White House to George Bush, but in reality the transfer of power
already is underway.
   The clock is quickly running out on Reagan's presidency, so
Congress, the federal bureaucracy and foreign governments are
searching for clues about what the next man will do.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher will be at the White House this week for farewell
meetings with Reagan. They also want to see Bush.
   Congress has quit for the year and won't be back until January,
foreclosing the possibility of any last-minute initiatives for
lawmakers from Reagan.
   Meanwhile, a transition team named by the newly elected Bush is
developing legislative strategy and priorities for the first 100
days of his presidency, a period regarded as crucial for setting the
right tone for a new administration.
   Out of the less than 10 weeks remaining in his presidency, Reagan
plans to spend three weeks on vacation in California. He will send a
final budget to Congress early next year but it won't get a second
look unless lawmakers are assured it really represents what Bush
wants done.
   ``The president-elect gets all the attention,'' said Chase
Untermeyer, newly named personnel chief for the Bush transition
team. ``The incumbent president is the one that people have to be
reminded of.''
   Untermeyer hastened to add that Reagan would be an exception to
the rule.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said, ``It is ironic that our
Constitution now provides automatically for up to 10 weeks of
crippled leadership each time the presidency of our nation changes
hands through elections.'' Pell has proposed a constitutional
amendment to move up the inauguration to Nov. 20 instead of Jan. 20
but his measure has generated little interest.
   Of course, Reagan is still in charge for the next 2{ months.
   ``The whole presidency is like an hourglass and there are very
few sands left in the top of the hourglass,'' said Stephen Hess,
senior fellow at Brookings Institution. ``But nevertheless if
something should happen, Ronald Reagan has the authority and is the
president until Jan. 20.''
   Some senior members of Reagan's administration already have quit.
Reagan's Cabinet and more than 500 top political appointees are
being asked to submit their resignations, effective at the pleasure
of the president. That will spare Bush the unpleasantness of having
to ask them to leave when he takes over Jan. 20.
   In the top ranks, a lucky few will be asked to stay, although
Bush has promised a major overhaul to reinvigorate the government.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is expected to be asked this
week to remain in his post. Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos and
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh are considered possible holdovers.
   Throughout the ranks of government, the jobs of about 5,000
political appointees could change hands. Many of those jobs will be
determined at a secretarial level or lower, and will not cross the
president's desk.
   ``It's not quite as horrifying as it may seem,'' Untermeyer said.
``It's in the hundreds rather than the thousands that really
matter.''
   With $3.25 million provided by taxpayers, Bush's transition team
set up shop on 3{ floors of an office building in Dupont Circle, not
far from the White House.
   In addition to combing through personnel resumes and planning
Bush's agenda, the staff also is charged with drafting an
organizational plan for the White House, drawing lines of authority
within the executive branch. To help them with their work,
transition planners have at their disposal a computer system that is
compatible with the one at the White House, so they can easily take
their work with them on Jan. 20.
   Bush already is ahead of schedule in starting to name his
Cabinet. On the morning after his election he said that longtime
friend James A. Baker III would be his secretary of state.
   Bush said he would like to get the whole Cabinet named ``sooner
rather than way late.''
   In the modern presidency, Dwight Eisenhower was the earliest to
begin naming his Cabinet and also was the first to complete the job.
He started on Nov. 20 and was finished by Dec. 1.
   The latest to get started were Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan,
who waited until Dec. 11 to begin naming Cabinet members. Reagan was
the latest to finish, naming his last Cabinet member _ Education
Secretary Terrell Bell _ on Jan. 8.
   When Reagan won the presidency in 1980, his transition team
swelled to about 1,500 people. Untermeyer describes the transition
from the Reagan presidency is ``a friendly takeover,'' and Bush says
he wants ``a somewhat leaner transition organization than we had in
1980.''
   The Reagan-Bush transition is unique. Not since 1929 _ when
Calvin Coolidge was succeeded by Herbert Hoover _ has a president
turned over the White House to a member of his own party.
   Bush said that makes his job easier.
   ``You don't have to send teams out to every agency. I know enough
about how the government works. We're on the same general
direction,'' Bush said. ``We don't have to go out and reinvent the
wheel.''

<HEAD>Fire Damages Building Where Tutu Peace Lecture To Be Given</HEAD>

   A fire set by arsonists damaged
a university building today where the annual Desmond Tutu Peace
Lecture was to be delivered, police and student leaders said.
   The building, which was painted with anti-Tutu slogans, also
houses the offices of a multiracial, anti-apartheid organization.
The offices were heavily damaged by the fire and files were stolen,
police said.
   A detonator, fuse and a flammable liquid were used to set fire to
the offices of the National Union of South African Students in the
building at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg,
police said.
   Sprinklers doused the fire, but flooded the building, damaging
corridors, lecture halls and equipment in the classrooms, said
Stephen Silver, spokesman for the student organization.
   Also today, police reported a limpet mine explosion damaged a
railway track near East London on Friday night and a black man was
shot to death by an unidentified gunman in the Natal province
township of Mpumalanga.
   The fire caused an estimated $240,000 damage to the building.
   Graffiti attacking Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Anglican
archbishop, was painted on the outside of the building where an
annual peace lecture bearing his name was to be delivered tonight.
Tutu was invited to attend, but was not planning to, said spokesman
John Allen.
   Allen said the name of the speaker, British Rabbi Julia
Neuberger, was printed in small letters on posters, and ``Desmond
Tutu Peace Lecture'' was in large block letters, possibly leading to
the impression that he was to appear.
   A police spokesman, Lt. Col. Frans Malherbe, said the fire was
being investigated by a criminal division of the police force.
   He said a phone recording machine and some files had been removed
from the offices of the student organization but that neither
security police nor the criminal investigators had removed anything.
He said police believed the same persons were responsible for the
arson, the graffiti and the thefts.
   Stephen Kromberg, national president of the student group, said
the attack ``is obviously aimed at intimidating us and disrupting
our anti-apartheid work.
   ``The bombing of our offices follows a string of attacks on other
anti-apartheid organizations. ... The police do not seem to have
made much progress with these cases and we hope that they will treat
this case with the seriousness it deserves.''
   Malherbe said the detonator and fuse found at the scene had been
used to light the fire, and not for explosive purposes. ``At this
stage it's being treated as an ordinary arson,'' he said.
   Police gave no details on the death Natal, where at least 1,000
people have died in the past two years in fighting between black
political groups for control of the townships.
   Police said they did not know when the limpet mine had exploded
on the railway line near East London in eastern Cape province, but
the damage, and a second, unexploded mine, were discovered today.
Services were not interrupted, said transport spokesman Louis du
Toit.
   Censorship rules imposed under the 29-month-old state of
emergency ban or restrict reporting about unrest, security force
actions, treatment of detainees, most forms of peaceful protest and
a broad range of statements the government considers subversive.

<HEAD>Sakharov Speaks For Dissidents But Also For Soviet Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov, the stooped and aging
``father'' of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, brings to the nation's
capital a dramatic reminder of the plight of dissidents in his
country but also how their burden has been eased by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   At 67, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning physicist speaks for Soviet
dissidents and sometimes for Gorbachev.
   He is an outspoken supporter of perestroika, the attempt to
reconstruct the ailing Soviet economy, but he has pleaded the case
of dissidents and has questioned the power Gorbachev derives from
dual control of the Communist party and the government.
   ``A head of state with such powers in a country that does not
have a multiparty system is just insanity,'' Sakharov said at a
press conference in Moscow before embarking on his first trip to the
United States.
   Sakharov stands as an ardent spokesman for political prisoners
and other dissidents, listing those Gorbachev should free. The
Soviet leader complies with Sakharov's requests, but the world's
most celebrated human rights activist keeps pushing, complimenting
and criticizing.
   A non-Jew, he is the symbol of Soviet Jews' clamoring to
emigrate, and of Armenians and other ethnic groups, as well.
Sakharov seeks to make the Soviet Union a kinder, gentler nation,
and to expand political and religious freedom.
   Sakharov both has praised Gorbachev's actions as ``deserving of
respect,'' thereby burnishing the Soviet President's image in the
West, and demanded more for the activists who remain in prison or in
psychiatric institutions.
   He has lobbied for Gorbachev before journalists crowded into his
Moscow apartment and has spoken in the Soviet leader's behalf to
international audiences. His praise of perestroika gives economic
reform a credibility in the West derived from Sakharov's reputation
for independence.
   Two years ago, Sakharov became a free man. At Gorbachev's
direction, the Politburo ended his virtual house arrest in Gorki, an
industrial city 250 miles northeast of Moscow where he had been sent
in 1980 for criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and
emigration restrictions and allegedly defaming the state.
   Sakharov, who won the Nobel prize in 1975 for his human rights
activism, will be in Washington through Wednesday primarily to
attend meetings of the International Foundation for the Survival and
Development of Humanity, a Moscow-based group that supports research
into such diverse fields as arms control, environmental protection
and energy and claims to be independent of all governments.
   William G. Miller, a former U.S. foreign service officer and
Senate staffer who heads the foundation's American office, said
Saturday the month-old group was established by a Soviet Council of
Ministers decree. ``The presence of academician Sakharov in the
United States is a direct consequence of the foundation's new
legitimacy,'' Miller said.
   The American executive director said all the problems the
foundation seeks to resolve require cooperation. ``Andrei Sakharov
has been in the forefront on these concerns for over 20 years,''
Miller said.
   The chairman is Yevgenii P. Velikhov, a physicist and vice
president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The vice-chairman is
Jerome B. Wiesner, former president of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Other board members include former Defense Secretary
Robert S. McNamara and Armand Hammer, the petroleum company
executive.
   The foundation, operating with dollars and rubles, plans to make
grants for projects that require international cooperation and make
recommendations to lending institutions and political leaders.
   For the American public, the highlights of Sakharov's visit will
be his meeting Monday with President Reagan and Wednesday with
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the speeches and news
conferences he will hold. On Tuesday, Sakharov receives the 1988
Albert Einstein peace prize and $50,000 award.
   Norman Cousins, chairman of the selection board, described
Sakharov as ``a person whose life proves that a single individual
can truly make an enormous impact on the conscience of the world.''
   Sakharov, in defending Gorbachev's economic reconstruction
program, has stressed its success would ease security concerns.
``The failures of perestroika,'' Sakharov said, ``would make
expansion a political necessity and the country would be extremely
dangerous in terms of world balance.''

<HEAD>Thirteen Killed In Ethnic Violence; Fuel Workers Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 13 people were killed in a
wave of ethnic violence, officials said Saturday, and a fuel
workers' strike called by a radical Sinhalese group raised fears of
severe food shortages.
   A military official said four people were killed and 20 others,
including 16 schoolchildren, were injured when a car bomb exploded
near Jaffna, 185 miles north of Colombo on Friday.
   The official, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said
the victims were all minority Tamils.
   The bombing was blamed on members of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, a militant group fighting for an independent Tamil
homeland on the island's north and east.
   The official said the car bomb might have been aimed at Indian
troops, posted in Sri Lanka to quell the Tamil rebellion, and that
it probably exploded prematurely.
   The bodies of five Tamils abducted Friday were found Saturday in
the town of Kalumnai, 136 miles east of Colombo, the official said.
The killings were blamed on the Liberation Tigers, the largest and
most powerful of the Tamil militias.
   The Tigers are at the forefront of the Tamils' 5-year-old war for
a separate state. The rebels say a Tamil homeland is needed to
combat alleged discrimination by Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese.
   Members of the People's Liberation Front, a radical Sinhalese
group, were blamed for killing four government supporters in central
Sri Lanka on Saturday.
   The military official said four Sinhalese, including the brother
of a government lawmaker and three of his supporters, were killed in
a car ambush at the town of Kurunegala, 52 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   In southern Sri Lanka, a strike by fuel workers led to gasoline
shortages and a breakdown in the distribution of food, authorities
said.
   Sufficient food supplies have been sent to the southern port town
of Galle, but gasoline shortages prevented distribution to other
towns in the region, Food Commissioner Graham Dissanayake said.
   About 2,500 employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corp., the island
nation's only supplier of gasoline, walked off the job Monday in
response to a strike call by the People's Liberation Front, which is
demanding the resignation of President Junius R. Jayewardene.
   Jayewardene on Friday issued an emergency decree that mandated
death by hanging for people convicted of instigating strikes or
refusing to report for work in ``essential services'' sectors, such
as fuel and transportation.
   This strikes were the latest in a series called by the front,
which opposes Jayewardene's peace overtures to Tamil rebels. It says
it won't be satisfied until the president resigns.
   Presidential elections are scheduled Dec. 19, but the front
claims the Jayewardene government is incapable of conducting a fair
vote. Jayewardene is barred by the constitution from seeking a third
term in the election.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Orders Use Of ID Cards In Pakistani Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered that
Pakistani voters must show identification cards before casting
ballots in the November elections for the national and provincial
legislatures.
   The 12-member court issued an injunction blocking a lower court
ruling on Tuesday that rejected the ID requirement, which had been
challenged by the main opposition Pakistan People's Party, which is
led by Benazir Bhutto.
   The party claimed many of Pakistan's 48 million eligible voters
do not have ID cards, especially women who refuse to be photographed
according to Moslem religious laws that require women to veil their
faces in public.
   The government said that about 93 percent of the electorate have
the cards, but the lower court found that in some districts records
showed there are more ID cards than eligible voters.
   The government appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds that
identity cards are the only way to prevent fraud at polling stations.
   The Supreme Court said it issued the injunction because there
wasn't enough time to consider the government's appeal before the
Nov. 16 elections for the National Assembly and the Nov. 19
elections for the provincial legislatures.

<HEAD>Dukakis Faulted for Running Unresponsive, Aloof and Parochial
Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the end, Michael Dukakis said he'd learned
something in his failure: ``One of the lessons of the campaign is
you have to respond and you have to respond quickly.''
   Some who had campaigned for him groaned when they heard it. If
this was the lesson, it was one they had learned long before and had
tried repeatedly to tell Dukakis and his high command.
   ``That's the first lesson of ward politics,'' said Michael
Goldman, a Boston political consultant brought in late in the
campaign as an adviser.
   Dukakis was faulted all fall for his failure to respond to strong
attacks on his record from the Bush campaign. In the last weeks of
his campaign, he acknowledged that he had dallied too long.
   His failure to respond was, most observers believe, a large
reason he was unsuccessful. But it was not the full story of why the
governor of Massachusetts failed as Democratic presidential nominee.
   Rather, it reflected a larger problem: a candidate and campaign
that were aloof and parochial _ and, many felt, arrogant.
   Dukakis and his campaign badly underestimated their opponent.
They resisted outside advice until it was too late. They failed to
find a message and voice until the race had been lost, and in fact
had no effective strategy after winning the nomination.
   They squandered months delivering little more than bland
bromides. And they failed utterly to recognize the devastating
impact the other side's attacks were having, even as Dukakis' image
was being undermined.
   ``They didn't know people,'' said Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young.
   Young was referring to Dukakis' advisers and consultants. But
interviews with those inside the campaign suggest the same might
well be said of the candidate himself.
   A number of top campaign staffers _ including manager Susan
Estrich, top strategist John Sasso, political aides Kirk O'Donnell
and Jack Corrigan _ are all named as finger-pointing goes on in a
Democratic Party distraught at its latest failure. Estrich in
particular is blamed by some in the party for allowing the
campaign's summer aimlessness, and for her Harvard Law School
approach to hot-button issues.
   What stands out in memory from the long Dukakis campaign are
missed opportunities by a team unprepared for the rough and tumble
of a general election campaign:
   _Before the convention, beginning to feel the Republicans'
needles, Dukakis responded with breathtaking naivete that Bush
should ``stop criticizing others.''
   _Dukakis let pass the opportunity to address defense and foreign
policy matters in a substantive way early on, when he could have
inoculated himself against coming attacks.
   _Day after day through the summer and much of the fall, Dukakis
virtually conceded the evening television news stories and the next
day's newspaper stories to the other side.
   Dukakis never seemed to adjust to his role as a national figure
on a national stage. He and his campaign were consumed by what was
in the Boston press, even in the campaign's final days _ a
reflection, it seemed, of his insulated and confined view.
   Dukakis once remarked that no ads went out of his campaign
without his personal approval. But his campaign was effectively
paralyzed, unable to mount a cogent television campaign.
   Republican strategists made no secret of their plans to try to
damage Dukakis' record and reputation. In the spring and summer they
even pointed to the prison furlough and Pledge of Allegiance issues
they would exploit. Yet when it came, the Dukakis campaign seemed
ill prepared.
   As Bush hammered Dukakis, some within the campaign grew angry at
their own inability to respond. Even Lloyd Bentsen complained.
   ``Everybody was frustrated by the unwillingness to deal with
it,'' said one campaign official, insisting on anonymity.
   As a result, campaign staffers out in the field sometimes worked
around Dukakis and his campaign hierarchy. In some states they
secretly printed and circulated tough ads and brochures that weren't
approved by the headquarters in Boston _ ``a bootleg
counter-slash,'' one official called it.
   Dukakis and his top campaign officials in Boston didn't seem to
understand the values and symbolism behind those issues Bush had
chosen. Dukakis seemed to assume that the nation knew him as
Massachusetts voters did.
   ``He could not believe that the son of immigrants could ever be
spun around on the Pledge of Allegiance,'' said Goldman. ``Because
Mike Dukakis didn't see himself as a liberal, he couldn't say what
he wasn't.''
   The result was that Dukakis, after carefully crafting a candidacy
based on moderation and problem-solving, came to be seen as
something culturally different to much of the country.
   He never looked like a fighter until the last couple weeks, when
he finally found a populist theme that connected with voters and the
ability to say it convincingly. But by then it was too late, and he
was just fighting to avoid embarrassment.

<HEAD>Government Bill Accepts Idea Of Multiparty System `In Principle'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary has approved draft legislation
that allows a multiparty political system in principle but does not
include the framework for independent parties, the justice minister
was quoted as saying today.
   The draft bill was approved by the Communist government Thursday
and goes before Parliament later this month. It refers to the right
of individuals and groups to establish political parties.
   ``While the text recognizes the possibility of organizing
political parties, it also stipulates that they cannot be organized
on the basis of this law on association,'' the Communist daily
Nepszabadsag quoted Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar as saying.
   Kulcsar was quoted as saying a separate law _ not likely to be
ready before 1990 _ will set up guidelines and regulate the
establishment of political parties.
   There has been extensive debate in Hungary in recent months over
the feasibility of a multiparty system. Dozens of independent groups
have formed, many with political platforms that are seen as a
nucleus of a party.
   Under the draft bill, ``A multiparty system is acceptable in
principle while its concrete realization requires a transitional
period,'' Kulcsar was quoted as saying.
   Leaders of independent groups have been cautious about expressing
too much optimism over the announcement of the party reference in
the draft bill.
   Rudolf Joo, a member of the independent Democratic Forum _ with a
membership of some 7,000 _ described it as ``a step forward on the
way to democratization, but it was announced in such a contradictory
manner that it limits our enthusiasm for it.''
   But he said that after 40 years of single party rule, ``(new)
parties cannot appear from one day to the next.''
   On Friday, Janos Berecz, chief ideologist of Hungary's ruling
Communist Party, told reporters that politcal reforms in Hungary is
a long-term process.
   Hungary's leadership under Comnunist Party chief Karoly Grosz has
permitted more openness in the media.
   Grosz also backs strict austerity measures, including personal
income taxes, to help reduce the foreign debt and to stimulate the
stagnating economy.

<TEXT>
   About 200 leftist guerrillas hurled bombs
and fired automatic weapons at a northern mining town and its
military base, and a provincial governor said today that 34 people
were killed and 31 wounded.
   The guerrillas threw the bombs at the telephone company, town
hall and a crowded square Friday night in Segovia, according to
Antioquia Gov. Antonio Roldan Betancur, who described the assault in
an interview with Caracol radio.
   The town is 180 miles northwest of Bogota.
   The blasts destroyed the telephone company and caused the
civilian injuries, he told the radio. Guerrillas also fired
automatic weapons.
   ``There has never been an attack so bloody and so cruel,
especially directed against the civilian population,'' Betancur told
the radio in the provincial capital of Medellin.
   It was the deadliest guerrilla attack in Colombia since Aug. 23,
when 42 people were killed _ 12 civilians, 12 police and military
and 18 guerrillas _ in a raid in the town of Saiza, 220 miles north
of Bogota.
   Betancur said all those killed in Segovia were civilians and
rebels of the leftist National Liberation Army and the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia. Betancur said the guerrillas, who arrived
by car, caused vast destruction to the base and the mining town of
15,000 people.
   Army units from the base, at the edge of town, repelled the
attackers after the hourlong raid, Betancur said. There were no
military casualties, said Betancur, who provided no details on the
attack on the base.
   ``I lament this episode, which left so many dead and so many
famalies in mourning,'' he told the radio.

   The commander of the communist rebel
army escaped from prison today with his wife after slipping away
from a birthday party for the former commandant of their stockade,
officials said.
   Lt. Col. Cresencio Maralit, spokesman of the Philippine
Constabulary, said the military sealed off approaches to Manila
after Romulo Kintanar and his wife Gloria escaped from the home of
Maj. Robelito Comilang at Camp Crame, a suburban military camp which
includes the stockade. Comilang said he had invited Kintanar and
other prisoners to attend his birthday party.
   Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao, senior officer on duty at Camp
Crame, said in a report that Kintanar was released from his cell
about noon and was escorted to Comilang's home in the camp for the
party.
   According to the report, Kintanar and the guard left the party
about two hours later and returned to the stockade. But a short time
later, Kintanar, his wife and another prisoner went back with the
same guard to Comilang's home.
   Dumlao said about 3 p.m., the other prisoner asked to be escorted
back to the stockade. The guard walked the prisoner back to his cell
and then returned to Comilang's home to fetch the other prisoners.
   When the guard returned, Kintanar and his wife had vanished,
Dumlao said. There was no explanation why Kintanar returned to
Comilang's home. The report also did not say how many people
attended.
   Maralit said Comilang and the acting stockade commander, Maj.
Benjamin Landrito, were confined to quarters and the guard was
jailed pending an investigation.
   Maralit described Kintanar and his wife as ``maximum security
prisoners'' but had no explanation why they were released from their
cells for a party.
   Landrito said he was asleep in his office during the escape and
that he never gave permission for Kintanar and other inmates to
attend the party.
   Comilang was temporarily relieved of his post as prison
commandant pending an investigation into last month's killing of Lt.
Col. Francisco Baula at the same stockade.
   Prison guards claimed Baula, who was a leader of the Aug. 28,
1987 failed coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino, was shot
while trying to escape. His relatives claim he was murdered.
   Kintanar and his wife were arrested in March in Manila along with
Rafael Baylosis, alleged secretary-general of the outlawed Communist
Party of the Philippines. The military hailed the arrest as a major
blow to the rebels.
   The military said Kintanar was commander of the 25,000-strong New
People's Army, which has been waging a 19-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state.
   Kintanar was widely believed to have organized assassination
squads responsible for killing scores of police and soldiers.
   Kintanar was the latest government opponent to escape military
custody. In April, the leader of the August 1987 coup attempt, Lt.
Col. Gregorio Honasan, escaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay with
the help of his guards.
   Honasan remains at large. A few days later, a Honasan
confederate, Lt. Col. Eduardo Matillano, escaped after being allowed
to leave his cell to visit a dentist. He was arrested in September.

   There they go again, as President Reagan might
say before he turns out the lights in the Oval Office on his way
back to the ranch.
   The same people who said Mario Cuomo would defeat Bob Dole for
the White House this fall are making odds on how quickly
President-elect Bush will have his legislative agenda chewed up by
an implacably hostile Democratic Congress.
   The argument goes this way: Bush was elected after a campaign
based largely on distortions of Michael Dukakis' record, was
extremely skimpy on the specifics and he doesn't have much of a
chance against congressional leaders who won just as big at the
polls as he did.
   ``His problem is going to be that there's going to be virtually
no honeymoon,'' says David Keene, a well-known conservative who
worked for Dole.
   It might turn out that way, and it is worth noting that 1988 is
the first election in 28 years in which a president of one party was
elected while the opposition party gained seats in the House.
   And Bush did devote a lot of attention in his campaign to
attacking Dukakis on highly emotional issues such as crime, without
providing many details of his ``flexible freeze'' or his call for a
``kinder, gentler nation.''
   One of the lines best remembered _ read my lips, no new taxes _
will be put to the test, no doubt.
   But the conventional wisdom turned out to be wrong in the crunch
as often as not during the campaign that ended on Tuesday.
   Remember the experts who said Bush's candidacy would unravel
swiftly after Dole defeated him in Iowa's Republican caucuses? It
did _ until the next election eight days later in New Hampshire that
doomed Dole.
   The same experts said none of the announced Democratic candidates
could ever win the nomination, and that New York Gov. Cuomo would
sweep the convention. But they were wrong.
   Among the reasons Bush won the White House this year, as campaign
manager Lee Atwater is fond of saying, is that his enemies
consistently underestimated him. Also, his inner circle was far
superior to anyone else's. The same team that patiently plotted the
post-convention political blitz that sent Bush surging past Dukakis
now has 10 weeks to plan a fast getaway from the new administration.
   There's no reason to think it won't be done with the same
thoroughness.
   For all the talk of a mandate for the Democratic Congress, the
senators and representatives also know that Bush won 40 states, many
of them by substantial margins.
   Bush already has signalled his hopes for a constructive
relationship with Congress:
   _ He conspicuously avoided saying he had a mandate when he
fielded questions from reporters on Wednesday. ``I'm going to do
everything I can to have good and open and friendly relationships
with the United States Congress. And I don't want us to talk at each
other. I want us to talk to each other,'' he later added.
   _ Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, the first
appointee, is highly regarded by congressional leaders who know him
as Reagan's first-term chief of staff and then as treasury secretary.
   _ Bush is widely expected to ask Nicholas Brady to stay on as
treasury secretary in the new government. Brady, who served several
months as an appointed senator, was swiftly confirmed for his
Cabinet post.
   _ Asked at his news conference whether his injunction against
taxes included all so-called revenue enhancements, Bush ducked. He
noted that Dukakis had criticized him for supporting an increase in
the Medicare premiums to finance catastrophic health care coverage.
``You'll have to define what you mean,'' he added.
   No matter what the experts predict, Congress and a president
sometimes have a way of working together when least expected.
   Like this year.
   The election-year Democratic Congress that adjourned last month
and the most conservative president in a generation _ a lame duck to
boot _ agreed on a bill to combat drug abuse, an overhaul of welfare
laws, a trade bill, a plant closing bill and also agreed on all 13
individual appropriations bill for the first time in many years.

   Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators jammed central
Rome on Saturday in a huge protest called by Italy's trade unions
over the government's tax policies.
   Estimates by union organizers, witnesses, news agencies and the
state-run RAI television put the turnout at 300,000 to 400,000.
   The protesters, who came from all over Italy by special trains
and buses, marched past the Colosseum and converged in the square in
front of St. John Lateran Church.
   There, they waved banners, chanted slogans and listened to
speeches by the leaders of the three main trade unions. The speakers
said the unions, which are joined in a confederation, would consider
calling a nationwide general strike unless the government acts on
their demands.
   The unions are demanding fiscal reforms on grounds that the
present tax system favors tax evaders and unfairly penalizes workers
and retirees. They dubbed the demonstration ``the march of the
honest ones.''
   The crowd chanted ``We already pay, it's time that everybody
pays!'' and carried placards and signs with slogans such as
``Handcuffs for tax evaders and their protectors.''
   ``On the fiscal side, we should all be equal in the eye of the
state and pay taxes in relation to what we possess,'' said Antonio
Pizzinato, secretary-general of the Communist-dominated General
Confederation of Italian Workers.
   ``That's not the way it is today under the existing structure,''
he told the crowd. ``There are those who pay everything on
everything and those are the workers and the retirees. And there are
those who evade or pay minimal amounts.''
   Giorgio Benvenuto, leader of the Socialist-led Italian Union of
Work, said the state lost the equivalent of $40 billion in revenue
from tax evasion in 1988 _ ``an insult to those honest taxpayers.''
   The union leaders are scheduled to meet soon with
parliamentarians who are debating the proposed 1989 national budget.

   The nuclear-powered attack submarine Miami
was launched Saturday while opponents of nuclear weapons
demonstrated outside the Electric Boat shipyard.
   The Los Angeles-class vessel was ``symbolic of the best America
can produce,'' said H. Lawrence Garrett III, undersecretary of the
Navy.
   It was the first sub launched at the Electric Boat shipyard since
the end of a bitter, three-month strike by the shipyard's 10,000
blue-collar workers. The walkout ended Oct. 11 with the ratification
of a new contract.
   The only reference to the strike was made by shipyard General
Manager James E. Turner Jr., who said the launch ``reaffirms the
ability of this company to withstand and recover from its
difficulty.''
   About 35 members of an anti-nuclear weapons group, The Coalition
to Stop the Trident, staged a demonstration outside the shipyard,
which also makes Trident missile-carrying subs. Demonstrators
carried signs with such messages as, ``What about the children?''
Police said there were no arrests.
   Stephen Kobasa, a protest organizer, said the demonstration was a
warmup for a major effort that will start with the Dec. 17 launch of
the Trident submarine Tennessee.
   The effort will conclude on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday in
January with a ``major civil disobedience action'' at Electric Boat,
Kobasa said.
   The Miami will have to undergo about a year of tests before it is
determined ready for active duty.
   The 360-foot-long sub eventually will be equipped with
anti-submarine torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles. It will carry
a crew of 12 officers and 115 enlisted men.
   The Navy has 39 attack submarines in the same class as the Miami.
Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corp., has produced 23
of them and has contracts for eight more.

   A school janitor jumped onto a driverless car
circling a parking lot and another man helped him get inside to stop
the vehicle moments before it would have plunged through the wall of
a crowded classroom.
   Larry Loy, 38, a janitor at Indianapolis Public School 89, hopped
on the hood of the car after it ran over a 4-year-old girl and
struck her 5-year-old brother and their mother.
   ``I timed it,'' Loy recalled. ``So when I saw it coming around I
jumped on the hood. I got on the top, and another guy ran up and
flipped the door handle so I could get in.''
   The accident occurred Friday when Michele Footman began to drive
away after picking up her son from kindergarten.
   The passenger door was not secured, and her daughter, Michelle,
fell out. Police said Mrs. Footman jumped out while the car was
still in gear.
   Patrolman Michael A. Taylor said the car probably reached a speed
of 25 mph as it circled the school parking lot. The car ran over the
girl and struck her mother, and 5-year-old Sheldon also jumped out
of the car and was hit.
   Loy said he recognized the other man as the father of another
student at the school.
   The girl was in intensive care at Riley Hospital for Children.
Her brother and their mother were treated and released.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader Escapes Prison After Attending Warden's Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of the Communist rebel
army escaped from prison Saturday after he was let out of his cell
to attend a birthday party for the former prison warden, officials
said.
   A spokesman for the Philippine Constabulary, Lt. Col. Cresencio
Maralit, said the military flashed a nationwide alarm and sealed off
approaches to Manila after Romulo Kintanar and his wife, Gloria,
fled about 3 p.m. from the home of Maj. Robelito Comilang.
   Kintanar and his wife were arrested in March. The military says
Kintanar is commander of the 25,000-strong New People's Army, which
has been waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state.
   Kintanar was widely believed to be the chief organizer of
communist assassination squads responsible for killing scores of
police and soldiers. He is the third prominent government opponent
to escape military custody.
   Comilang, the former warden at the military stockade, invited
Kitanar and other prisoners to his party at his home at Camp Crame.
The prison is on the grounds of Camp Crame.
   Maralit told reporters an investigation was under way because
Kintanar was a ``maximum security prisoner'' who should not have
been allowed outside his cell without a guard.
   Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao, senior officer on duty Saturday at
Camp Crame, said Kintanar was released from his cell about noon and
escorted to Comilang's home.
   According to the report, Kintanar and the guard left the party
about two hours later and returned to stockade. Later, Kintanar, his
wife and another rebel prisoner, Jorge Madlos, went back with the
same guard to Comilang's party.
   Dumlao said that at about 3 p.m., Madlos asked to be taken back
to the stockade. Constable Jimmy Acma walked Madlos back to his cell
but when he returned to the party, Kintanar and his wife were gone,
Dumlao said.
   Dumlao said several guards were arrested and Comilang and the
acting prison commander, Maj. Benjamin Landrito, were detained.
   The general gave no explanation why Kintanar returned to the
party a second time. Landrito said he did not not give permission
for Kintanar to leave the cell the second time because ``I was in my
office, sleeping.''
   ``The only time I knew about the escape of Kintanar and his wife
was when they woke me up at 3:15,'' Landrito told The Associated
Press in an interview late Saturday.
   Comilang was temporarily relieved of his post as prison
commandant pending an investigation into last month's killing of Lt.
Col. Francisco Baula at the stockade.
   Prison guards claimed Baula, a leader of the Aug. 28, 1987 coup
attempt against President Corazon Aquino, was shot while trying to
escape. His relatives claim he was murdered.
   Kintanar and his wife were arrested in March in Manila along with
Rafael Baylosis, the alleged secretary-general of the outlawed
Communist Party of the Philippines.
   The military hailed the arrests as a major blow to the rebel
movement.
   The Camp Crame prison houses about 160 prisoners, including both
Communist rebels and right-wing extremists jailed in connection with
coup attempts against the Aquino government.
   Kintanar was the latest prominent opponent of the Aquino
government to escape military custody. In April, Lt. Col. Gregorio
Honasan, leader of the August coup attempt, escaped from a prison
ship in Manila Bay with the help of his guards.
   Honasan remains at large.
   A few days later, a Honasan confederate, Lt. Col. Eduardo
Matillano, escaped after being allowed to leave his cell to visit a
dentist.
   Matillano was arrested in September in Quezon City.

<HEAD>Studies Disagree On Danger To Neighbors of Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, neighbors of nuclear plants have
worried about cancer. Although some research suggests that just
living near a plant may increase the risk of leukemia from
radiation, other scientific studies indicate that such small doses
of low-level radiation pose small risk.
   Concern over nuclear contamination has been growing as the Energy
Department discloses more and more problems at the nuclear weapons
production plants that it runs in 13 states. The department has said
it will cost up to $110 billion to clean up environmental
contamination at 17 major plants.
   Those plants ``constitute a public health emergency,'' said Dr.
H. Jack Geiger, a medical professor in New York and spokesman for
the anti-nuclear group, Physicians for Social Responsibility.
   Geiger, calling the weapons complex a ``creeping Chernobyl,'' is
urging the federal government to commission extensive studies of the
effect of radiation from the plants on surrounding populations.
   In fact, the federal government has spent about $2 billion
sponsoring dozens of studies on nuclear workers and neighbors, but
has come up without a clear picture of the health risks.
   Research is hampered by shifts in population near nuclear plants
and problems measuring exactly how much radiation people are exposed
to. Moreover, the rate of excess cancer is hard to determine against
a national population in which, according to the American Cancer
Society, an estimated one out of three Americans will eventually
have cancer.
   ``The whole situation is rather puzzling,'' said Seymour Jablon,
an expert at the National Cancer Institute in the Washington suburb
of Bethesda. ``The only thing that is really sticking its head up is
leukemia,'' especially among children.
   To gain a clearer picture of the risks, the cancer institute is
harnessing a mainframe computer to study health, mortality and
morbidity data from 127 U.S. counties which host or are next to
nuclear power plants or weapons processing facilities. The results
will be compared with rates from 400 other counties not near
reactors.
   The project began last January and results are expected by the
end of next summer, said Jablon.
   Several studies of populations near British reactors have showed
higher than average rates of leukemia and other types of cancers,
and some studies of workers at the Savannah River Plant, in Aiken,
S.C., and at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, in Richland, Wash.,
show higher than average rates for some types of cancers.
   Another study of children in Utah exposed to fallout from atomic
tests in Nevada 1951 to 1958 showed a higher rate of leukemia.
   But the results of those studies have been disputed by other
researchers, and some scientists say they do not present a general
pattern that would prove nuclear plants pose a threat.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
which has been scathingly critical of the Energy Department's safety
and environmental practices, reviewed many of those studies and
concluded in a two-volume report in 1981 that ``there is as yet no
way to determine precisely the cancer risks of low-level ionizing
radiation and it is unlikely that this question will be resolved
soon.''
   For workers at nuclear plants, generally exposed to higher levels
of radiation than nearby residents, ``the most general statement we
can say is that overall mortality is similar to or better than the
general population,'' said Dr. Shirley A. Fry, head of epidemiologic
research at Oak Ridge Associated Universities, in Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
which is conducting research under contract for the Energy
Department.
   ``We have seen in several populations an elevation of one type of
cancer or another, but there is no pattern,'' she said.
   Scientists may have trouble measuring exposure rates among
nuclear neighbors, but the government now admits some cases of
extensive radiation release.
   One of the grimmest was the release in December 1949 of massive
amounts of radioactive iodine 131 from the Hanford plant.
   The so-called ``green run'' apparently was intended to help U.S.
intelligence officials develop means of tracking suspected radiation
leaks from the Soviet nuclear weapons program.
   June Stark Casey, a sophomore at Whitman College in Walla Walla,
Wash., in 1949, said that after the release she became weak and
began to lose hair.
   ``My parents spent thousands of dollars taking me from doctor to
doctor. Although these are common effects of overexposure to
radiation, the cause didn't occur to my parents because the releases
were kept secret,'' Casey was quoted as saying in the Bulletin of
Atomic Scientists.
   The links between cancer and high levels of radiation are better
documented, most convincingly in studies of 50,000 survivors of the
atomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Among those exposed to massive doses of radiation from the bombs,
researchers found 480 excess cancers, including about 100 leukemias,
followed by cancers of the lung, stomach, colon, female breast and
thyroid, said Jablon of the National Cancer Institute.
   The lack of persuasive scientific data has not persuaded critics
that no link exists between low-level radiation doses and cancer.
   ``They don't have good data. The means they have to measure
disease are too crude, and what they are looking for is subtle. But
that doesn't mean that we don't have problems,'' said Frances Close
Hart, chairwoman of the Environmental Research Foundation, an
environmental group in Columbia, S.C., and an active critic of the
Savannah River Plant, in Aiken.

   The official portrait of this year's city
council shows one alderman, an outspoken community leader, sitting
at his desk with a paper bag over his head.
   ``I hope it does hang (in City Hall) because I feel people
throughout history will ... ask just as you did, ``Why is that guy
wearing a bag over his head,''' alderman Michael R. McGee said
Saturday.
   ``Well it was just my response to my total embarrassment of the
conduct of my fellow council members during the last budget
process,'' he said. ``I was utterly embarrassed to be seen with them
in an official picture.
   ``It was a way to poke a little fun at them also.''
   McGee donned the bag, with cut-out eyes and a drawing of a smile,
at Thursday's portrait session and refused to remove it.
   McGee said he was protesting the council's easy approval of Mayor
John O. Norquist's austerity budget which trimmed police, fire and
health department budgets.
   ``I think through history this council will become known as the
council that wimped out,'' he said.
   McGee said programs affected by the cuts were particularly
important to inner city residents. He said more than 250 people
appeared at public hearings to protest the cuts but were given no
consideration.
   Council President Thomas P. Donegan declined to say if this
year's portrait would hang in the City Hall corridor with council
pictures of previous years.

   President Reagan, marking his last Veterans'
Day as president, said today he leaves office gratified that ``once
again our young men and women are proud to wear the uniform of their
country.''
   The president delivered his weekly radio address from Camp David,
the presidential retreat in Maryland to which he flew Friday after
Veterans' Day observances at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington
National Cemetery and at the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial.
   His remarks echoed a note he has sounded often in recent weeks as
he campaigned for Vice President George Bush, the Republican
candidate who was elected Tuesday as his successor.
   ``On this, the last Veterans' Day I will commemorate as
president, I would like to say that if there is one change George
Bush and I made that touches me most profoundly it would probably be
this: once again our young men and women are proud to wear the
uniform of their country.''
   Reagan did not elaborate on the remark, but has often boasted
that his administration began rebuilding American military might
after a period of neglect when he took over from Democratic
President Jimmy Carter in 1981.
   At Arlington, Reagan paid tribute to the service of all veterans
and war dead on behalf of ``a nation that today and always pledges
itself to their eternal memory.''
   At the memorial, he focused on the nation's most recent war,
saying that those who served in Vietnam are now universally
recognized as having earned ``a badge of pride.''
   ``In our hearts, you will always be young,'' he said of the dead.
   The president and his wife, Nancy, both dressed in black and
walking hand-in-hand, left a handwritten note addressed to ``our
young friends'' at the base of the chevron-shaped black-granite wall
on which the 58,000 names of the Vietnam war dead are inscribed.
   ``You fought for your country and for its safety and for the
freedom of others with strength and courage,'' said the brief note,
placed near the flowers, letters, flags, medals and other items left
by thousands of visitors to the memorial.
   A crowd of several thousand people standing on the wet grass and
autumn leaves heard Reagan declare that although the war divided the
nation, the flow of thousands of boat people from Vietnam, mass
murders in Cambodia and other events are evidence the cause was
just, ``however imperfectly pursued.''
   President-elect George Bush, in a statement issued from Florida,
where he is vacationing, noted that it was the first Veterans Day
since Reagan signed into law the bill creating the Cabinet-level
Department of Veterans Affairs.
   ``This is a distinction that America's veterans have earned and
richly deserve,'' Bush said. ``It guarantees that those who have
worn the uniform of our armed forces will always have a strong voice
in our government.''
   Reagan, in his speech, expressed gratitude to the ``gentle
heroes'' of Vietnam and said the government was doing everything
possible to learn whether American soldiers are still captive in
Southeast Asia.
   He said unless the government of Vietnam gives assurances that
there aren't any who are alive, ``we will assume some are and will
do everything we can to find them.''

   The Rev. Al Green sang his soul song ``Let's
Stay Together'' to a young couple he married while they were perched
on a billboard 50 feet off the ground.
   Green smiled and waved to fans Friday as he was hoisted up by
crane to the billboard overlooking a gas station and parking lot. He
performed the ceremony for Jill Lewis, 20, and James Tombstone, 19,
while in a cherry picker facing the billboard.
   ``I've performed about 20 weddings,'' said the Los Angeles
resident, who became a minister 11 years ago. ``This is the most
unusual wedding I've done. It's kind of far out.''
   The couple vied with 29 other couples for the sky-high wedding in
a contest sponsored by WABB Radio and WALA-TV. They won a Las Vegas
honeymoon trip, a reception and other prizes.
   The 43-year-old singer, dressed in a snappy black suit topped
with a pink carnation and carrying a small Bible, arrived in a white
limousine. The bride wore black satin, and the groom wore a white
tuxedo and sported purple hair.
   Green has a duet with Annie Lennox of Eurythemics on the record
charts, ``Put A Little Love in Your Heart.''
   He sold millions of records in the early '70s as a rhythm and
blues and pop singer and later switched to gospel.

   Only in public schools are children exposed to a
diversity of cultures that will help them relate to people around
the world, Mayor Andrew Young told a group of educators.
   ``I may have neglected my studies but I sure got an education,''
Young said, referring to his childhood in the segregated public
schools in New Orleans. ``By the time I left elementary school, I
was an accomplished negotiator. ... Nobody wants to fight. You're
chicken if you run. So to survive, you have to negotiate.''
   One of the problems underlying the country's international trade
deficit, he said, is that many industrial leaders went to private
schools and exclusive colleges where all the students are alike.
   ``We're running a $170 billion trade deficit essentially because
the captains of American industry don't know how to deal with people
who are different,'' Young said in a keynote address Friday to the
National Education Association National Conference.
   The ability to get along with people from different cultures is a
``lesson best learned in the public school,'' said Young, former
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

   Acclaimed pianist Vladimir Horowitz has
donated to Yale University 218 original recordings of Carnegie Hall
concerts he gave during the 1940s and 1950s.
   ``This was a prime time for him and these are the only documents
of those performances,'' Yale music librarian Harold E. Samuel said
Saturday. ``What makes them more valuable is their uniqueness. .. .
No one but he, and I suppose a couple of friends, has ever heard
them.''
   Horowitz employed an engineer to ``cut'' the 78-rpm records
during his Carnegie Hall performances and used them to judge his
recitals, Samuel said.
   Yale acquired the recordings along with other memorabilia through
an alumnus who knows Horowitz's wife, Samuel said.
   Horowitz, 85, has performed at the university several times
during his career, which spans more than a half century, and is an
assistant fellow of the school's Silliman College.

   Penthouse magazine publisher Bob
Guccione can buy a $12 million Boardwalk tract where a hotel casino
was once proposed, a state appeals court said.
   The court ruling Thursday was the latest decision in nine years
of litigation over the site.
   Guccione became embroiled in a lawsuit with Greta and Joseph
Shamy, who were under contract to buy the site in 1977, according to
court papers.
   The Shamys, of Galloway Township, and Guccione had agreed to form
a corporation to buy the property and develop a new hotel casino.
But the Shamys sued for breach of contract in 1979.
   Seven years later, after numerous court hearings, a Superior
Court judge ordered the property sold in competitive bidding.
   Guccione's attorney, Henry N. Luter of Morristown, said Guccione
and an investment group put together by the Shamys made separate
offers.
   A court-appointed receiver recommended the property go to

   Homeless street children gathered
around Mother Teresa while the 78-year-old nun addressed an
estimated 2,000 wellwishers at Louis Botha Airport Saturday.
   The Nobel Peace Prize winner came to South Africa to establish a
charity mission in Khayelitsha, a black township on the outskirts of
Cape Town.
   Mother Teresa blessed the crowd and called on them to love one
another and to begin by loving their own families.
   The nun founded the Missionaries of Charity order in 1950 and
became known as the Saint of Calcutta for her work with the poor in
that Indian city. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and has
traveled widely since to establish 384 missions in 84 countries.

<HEAD>Contest Angers Candidates Who Hoped To Re-Cycle Campaign Signs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Candidates who hoped to recycle their
campaign signs for their next election are upset over a radio
contest that offered cash for the listener with the biggest
collection of campaign placards.
   ``I want my signs back, and if any of them are damaged, they're
going to have to pay for them. I'll sue them if I have to,'' said
Jay DiBenedetto, a losing candidate for Winnebago County Board.
   ``I plan on running again, and a lot of my signs can be used the
next time,'' DiBenedetto said.
   The controversy was sparked when WYBR-FM offered $104 _ its
frequency _ to the listener who scored the largest load of campaign
signs.
   The station received 1,800 placards and publicity from local news
media for its post-election clean-up contest.
   But politicians began complaining Thursday, and station employees
worked to sort out the pile and make peace.
   Circuit Court Clerk Ron Kotche said several candidates were
unhappy.
   ``Communication is the word. I'm sure they would have loved the
help getting them down _ if (the station) had just called,'' Kotche
said. ``If they are in good shape, you use (signs) over and over.''
   DiBenedetto said police officer Warren Latham brought him some of
his signs from the radio station Thursday, but some of his larger
ones were missing and others were damaged.
   ``I told him I would rather see him out fighting crime,''
DiBenedetto said.

<HEAD>Eyes May Be Painted on Aircraft to Avoid Bird Hits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Civil Aviation Ministry is
considering painting eyes on Indian Airlines planes to scare away
birds and prevent aircraft from hitting them, news reports said
Saturday.
   United News of India quoted Shivraj Patil as saying that the
eyes, used in Japan to avoid bird-plane collision, were being
considered for Indian Airlines.
   Bird hits are fairly common in India. According to a recent study
by the International Airports Authority of India, which is
responsible for the upkeep of domestic airports, Indian Airlines
aircraft reported 26 bird hits in September.
   The hits caused a loss of $1.35 million, the study said.
   Birds are usually sucked in through the jet engines and cause
severe mechanical damage. Because the hits are usually within
minutes of takeoff or landing, they can be dangerous.
   An air show scheduled Jan. 26, which was to feature Indian Air
Force jets flying over New Dehli, was canceled this year because of
fear of bird hits. The show is an annual event for celebrations of
India proclaiming itself a republic.

<HEAD>Bush's Transition Team Moving Into New Headquarters</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tops with 3 grafs from Reagan radio speech; picks up 2nd graf,
Bush, meanwhile.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   As President-elect George Bush's transition
team moved into its new headquarters and aides devised procedures
for picking leaders of the next administration, President Reagan
said today that Bush ``has gotten his mandate from the American
people.''
   ``We the people can take pride in just how strong our political
system is,'' the president said in his weekly radio address,
delivered from the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md. ``We have
made our choice and life goes on.''
   ``George Bush has gotten his mandate from the American people, a
mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and
prosperity to the American people, to bring hope and opportunity to
all Americans and to expand the frontiers of freedom around the
world,'' the president said.
   Bush, meanwhile, vacationed in Gulf Stream, Fla., Friday where he
said little about his plans for the transition. He reiterated that
there would be no personnel announcements until after he returns to
the nation's capital Monday or Tuesday.
   Asked if he was compiling lists of potential appointees, Bush
said, ``No. No.''
   Robert Teeter, co-director of the transition with Craig Fuller,
chief of staff in the vice president's office, said the two men
planned to spend the weekend mulling over procedures for the
personnel selection process. They will confer early next week after
the transition office officially opens on Monday.
   ``We'll go to him (Bush) on Tuesday or Wednesday when he gets
back and give him some recommendations,'' Teeter said in a telephone
interview from his home in Michigan.
   A key player in deciding who serves under Bush is Chase
Untermeyer, the personnel director. Untermeyer, who met Friday with
Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, would be in his new office Monday,
an aide said.
   Speculation was rampant, meanwhile, about whom Bush would name to
the top jobs. So far, Bush has picked only one Cabinet member:
former Treasury Secretary and campaign chairman James A. Baker III
as secretary of state.
   Asked about speculation that Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, a
Bush confidant, would remain in the job, the vice president
responded: ``They've been saying that for weeks.'' He refused to
comment further.
   A source on the transition team, refusing to be quoted by name,
said Bush was looking for a new face to replace William Webster as
CIA director.
   Bush, who served as CIA director in 1976, is expected to take a
keen interest in filling that job. His desire to look at other
people does not necessarily mean he is dissatisfied with Webster's
performance, the transition source said. But ``the vice president
want to put his own stamp on things,'' he said.
   Bush said as much at a news conference on Wednesday. ``I will for
the most part bring in a brand new team of people from across the
country,'' he said.
   Associates of Webster have said privately that the CIA director
is eager to stay on in the post he took over in May 1987. Earlier in
the Bush campaign, Webster was told he could keep his job, but since
then all he has read in published reports are the names of possible
successors, the sources said.
   One possible candidate for CIA director is James Lilley, the
ambassador to South Korea, whom Bush has known since Lilley was the
chief of the CIA station in Beijing while Bush was U.S. envoy to
China in the 1970s.
   The source said former Texas Republican Sen. John Tower was still
the front-runner for secretary of defense although the mention of
Paul H. O'Neill, chairman and chief executive of Alcoa, is ``no
accident.''
   Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser under former
President Ford, could get the same post in the Bush administration,
the source said. But congressional sources indicated there was talk
Scowcroft might take over the CIA.
   Another source, meantime, said Fuller and retiring New Hampshire
Gov. John Sununu were candidates for White House chief of staff.
``It could go either way,'' said the source, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Teeter and Sheila Tate, the transition's spokeswoman, refused to
comment any job speculation.

   The murder case against a disbarred lawyer
accused of beating his adopted daughter to death rests on
circumstantial evidence, which can be a stumbling block with jurors,
according to a legal expert.
   Prosecutors in the Joel Steinberg trial admit they have no
eyewitnesses or physical evidence linking him directly to 6-year-old
Lisa's death, so they must try to disprove every reasonable
possibility except the defendant's guilt.
   Richard Uviller, professor of criminal law at Columbia University
Law School, said the word ``circumstantial'' is perceived as
``dirty'' in the minds of many jurors. The prosecutor's first task
is to overcome this prejudice, he said.
   ``Circumstantial evidence should not necessarily be thought of as
inferior,'' Uviller said last week. ``It is no different than other
kinds of evidence.''
   Steinberg, 47, is on trial in the death of the illegally adopted
child. The chubby-cheeked first-grader was removed unconscious from
Steinberg's Greenwich Village apartment Nov. 2, 1987. She died three
days later.
   The death of the little girl in an affluent, well-educated
household shocked many New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of
the duty and ability of neighbors, teachers and social workers to
recognize and report evidence of child abuse.
   Prosecutors have introduced photographs showing wounds and
bruises on both his live-in companion and Lisa that were so grim
they visibly disturbed many jurors. Prosecutors also have called or
will call witnesses to testify that:
   _Only Steinberg, his live-in companion, Hedda Nussbaum, and a
16-month-old boy were with Lisa when she received her fatal injury.
   _Lisa's fatal head injury was consistent with a blow from a man
Steinberg's size and that she could not have gotten it from falling
down.
   _Steinberg's knuckles were red, swollen and scratched the day
Lisa was hospitalized and he was arrested.
   _Ms. Nussbaum was too physically and emotionally injured to have
done anything to Lisa or to protect the child from the only father
she ever knew.
   _Steinberg lied when he told police that the child fell
unconscious after choking on vegetables.
   _Steinberg told reporters there were no bruises on Lisa even
though they were on every part of her body as she lay comatose in a
hospital.
   Uviller said a number of strong indicators of guilt, though
``circumstantial,'' may be more convincing than eyewitnesses. He
pointed out that in a circumstantial case the judge must tell the
jury they need a ``moral certainity'' to find guilt.
   The prosecutor should show ``exclusive opportunity'' to commit
the crime, and ``motivation and disposition'' based on past
behavior, Uviller said.
   The task of the defense is the opposite of the prosecution,
Uviller said, to show that possibilities exist other than the
defendant's guilt.
   In his opening statement, Assistant District Attorney Peter
Casolaro told jurors that virtually all the evidence was
circumstantial, but he promised that the facts and circumstances
taken together would prove the defendant's guilt.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, a former children's book editor, is expected to
testify for the prosecution after Thanksgiving. She was also charged
with Lisa's death, but charges were dropped in return for her
testimony.
   Ms. Nussbaum spent the past year getting medical and psychiatric
treatment for injuries her lawyer, Barry Scheck, says she received
at Steinberg's hands. Scheck says that although the law recognized
she was unable to help Lisa and forgave her, ``She will never
forgive herself.''
   Steinberg received Lisa the day she was born to an unwed
teen-ager, Michele Launders. Ms. Launders said she paid Steinberg
$500 for ``filing fees'' after he promised to place the baby with a
middle-class Catholic family. Instead, he kept the child for himself
and Ms. Nussbaum, who are Jewish.
   Ms. Launders, now 27, watches the trial daily from the front row,
occasionally crying and frequently glaring at Steinberg.
   The 16-month-old boy police found in the apartment also was
obtained illegally from an unwed teen-ager. He has been returned to
his natural mother.
   The physician who arranged the boy's transfer to Steinberg
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, illegally placing a child for
adoption, and is awaiting sentence.

   Nobody knows now if little Paolo had a family
name when he was born. Workmen's families in old Italy often did
without one. When he died at 60 he no longer needed one _ everybody
knew him just as Veronese, the painter from Verona.
   The National Gallery of Art is commemorating his death 400 years
ago with the opening Sunday of the biggest show of his work ever
seen in this country. There will be 50 paintings and 55 drawings,
brought together with the help of a grant from the Ford Motor Co.
   Veronese, the son of a stonecutter, did both secular and
religious work. Feeling for everyday life comes out in many of them,
whatever the theme.
   A favorite subject was the Holy Family resting on their flight
into Egypt. A donkey is featured in at least three depictions of
that scene. One of them adds what the catalog calls ``a rather
illogical cow.'' In another, an acrobatic angel picks dates from a
tree and tosses them into an apron held by a second angel, while a
third attends to the donkey and a fourth is hanging laundry on a
bush.
   There is scholarly disagreement about the laundry. The catalog
calls it a ``baby dress.'' Beverly Louise Brown, curator of the
show, thinks it is something that belongs to the Virgin Mary.
   The painting comes from the Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Fla.
   Veronese's exuberance got him into trouble on a painting of the
Last Supper. Church authorities called him to task for including
``buffoons, drunkards, Germans, dwarfs and other such
scurrilities.'' They did not mention the soldiers, dogs and exotic
animals.
   By changing the name to ``The Feast in the House of Levi'' he
saved the canvas from being burned. It is now in Venice.
   Almost all the paintings in this exhibit have been recently
cleaned, which shows up the brilliant color Veronese is known for.
Three were so brilliant, Italian authorities had second thoughts
about lending them.
   ``When the Italian authorities had a look at them after the
cleaning they did a double-take,'' said J. Carter Brown, director of
the gallery.
   The three works are larger-than-life paintings of saints from
Modena, Italy. One of them, Saint Menna, may be a self-portrait of
Veronese.
   Ms. Brown said that unlike American museums, Italian museums must
submit their proposals for loans to the national government. They
are reviewed by the ministry of foreign affairs. She recalled cases
when loans agreements were canceled by the government at the last
moment.
   ``It's their artistic patrimony, you know,'' she said. ``They
don't like some things to leave the country, even on loan.''
   The paintings did arrive and were hung, but only on Thursday. The
exhibit has been in preparation for four years.
   It will close Feb. 20.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address, broadcast Saturday from Camp David, Md.:
   My fellow Americans, this week we witnessed a glorious event: we
the people going to the polls to determine our political destiny.
   I guess I don't need to tell you, I think the United States of
America did itself proud with the selection of George Bush as the
41st president of the United States and Dan Quayle as his vice
president.
   George Bush has gotten his mandate from the American people, the
mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and
prosperity to bring hope and opportunity to all Americans, and to
expand the frontiers of freedom around the world.
   You know all year long people were saying it was time for a
change. Well by your choice this week you proved we were right when
we said we _ George Bush, Dan Quayle, and the Republican party _ are
the change. It began eight years ago and it's going to continue.
   But some things don't change, like the glory of the American
political system. We saw it at work on Tuesday after the dust
cleared and the people had spoken. That night the nation was
fortunate to witness the grace and dignity of the Democratic
candidate Governor Dukakis as he congratulated George Bush in his
victory. He ran a tough race, full of energy and purpose and I
salute him for his dedication and courage.
   On Tuesday night and in the days that have followed it, and in
the 10 weeks before January 20th 1989, we the people can take pride
in just how strong our political system really is. We take it for
   granted sometimes, but I couldn't help thinking on Tuesday night
how inspiring it is that we know we Americans can choose our leader
without fear of violence. All Americans from Hawaii to Maine know
that when the voice of the people is heard, even the mightiest among
us must bow before it and accept its wisdom.
   President-elect Bush said it well the other day, ``We can now
speak the most magestic words that democracy has to offer. The
people have spoken.''
   Only twice in our history, during the dark days of our Civil War
has anyone dared to question the wisdom of the American people as
they chose their president, dared to deny the validity of the
selection.
   In other nations a disgruntled group of defeated politicians
might try to stage a coup d'etat or might even follow our disastrous
mistake from the 1960s and go to war, brother against brother,
rather than consent to the will of the people.
   But here we Americans are just four days after one of the most
important nights in our history, working or playing or just enjoying
our weekend. We've made our choice, and life goes on. We don't even
need to give it a thought. But when we do, I think it's cause for us
to wonder at our freedom.
   We continue to enjoy our freedom because of those brave Americans
among us who have legitimately taken up arms in the service of their
country, protecting and defending the United States of America. This
weekend, we commemorate America's veterans _ those who did their
duty so that we could be free and strong, so that tyranny could find
no quarter, so that we could live in peace.
   I think of the example of Staff Sergeant Carlos Stollard, one of
the Gold Star men in World War II. In a 1944 letter to his parents,
Carlos wrote, ``I believe in making that future a place where little
children can go swimming and playing around their homes without
being mangled for life from bursting bombs and flaming debris that
was once their homes, so that they can have a mother's care instead
of being left in some dark corner shivering with cold and dying with
hunger and wondering if mother, in a concentration camp, is being
cruelly beaten or if she is dead. That's what we are fighting for,
and I would gladly give ten lives if I had them.''
   Well, like all of us, Carlos Stollard had but one life to give
   for his country. He died in action in France on July 26, 1944.
His heroic example reminds us why sometimes we must take up arms so
that we can live free and at peace. Every veteran in this country
deserves our thanks and gratitude this weekend of all weekends.
   And my friends, on this, the last Veteran's Day I will
commemorate as President, I would like to say that if there is one
change George Bush and I made that touches me most profoundly, it
would probably be this: once again, our young men and women are
proud to wear the uniform of their country. Flight Lieutenant George
Bush sure was.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and may God bless you.

<HEAD>Report Says US Anti-Drug Efforts in Bolivia, Colombia Ineffective</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bolivian farmers brought three times as much
new land under coca cultivation in 1987 as the government of that
country eradicated under an agreement with the United States,
congressional investigators said.
   Widespread corruption in Bolivia and the violence of the drug
lords in Colombia, along with greatly increased cultivation, have
rendered U.S. State Department anti-drug programs in those countries
ineffective, investigators for the General Accounting Office wrote
in a report last week.
   GAO did not examine the programs of the Drug Enforcement Agency
in Bolivia and Colombia.
   Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, which is
made from the coca leaf, and the source of 75 percent of the U.S.
supply. Production capacity for 1987 was estimated by the State
department at 143 tons. Bolivia is the second-ranking producer with
capacity of 99 tons.
   State Department anti-drug expenditures in the two countries will
have totaled $106 million by the end of the current fiscal year,
with current annual spending about $10 million in each country.
Spending by the Drug Enforcement Agency and drug-related spending by
the Agency for International Development in both countries add $15.6
million a year.
   A voluntary coca eradication program wiped out 2,570 acres in
1987 and early 1988, ``an all-time high for Bolivia,'' but an
estimated 8,150 acres were brought under cultivation, making the
total about 100,000 acres, the report said.
   ``Bolivian narcotics interdiction efforts during 1987 were even
less impressive since only 2 percent of the coca paste produced in
Bolivia was seized, in addition to 148 kilograms (326 pounds) of
cocaine,'' the GAO report said.
   Colombia has made a notable effort to combat coca cultivation and
processing and has been the most cooperative of all Andean countries
but was unable to prevent farmers from increasing coca area from
38,300 acres in 1985 to 61,800 acres in 1987, GAO wrote.
   Colombian eradication fell from 4,940 acres in 1985 to 1,140
acres in 1987, though seizures of laboratories nearly doubled from
725 to 1,360 in the same time.
   The murders of judges, government ministers, police officers and
editors ``has made it extremely difficult for the government of
Colombia to recruit qualified individuals to serve'' in police and
judicial offices, the report said.
   U.S. expectations may ``exceed the realistically achievable goals
and the effect that a $10 million narcotics control program can have
on a well-established, multi-billion dollar industry'' in Colombia,
the report said.
   ``Narcotics corruption is viewed as the largest single problem
affecting U.S. narcotics control efforts in Bolivia. According to
several U.S. and Bolivian officials, corruption exists within all
levels of the Bolivian government and very few government officials
can be trusted,'' GAO said.
   The report said coca eradication efforts were bound to remain
futile until an effective herbicide is used in aerial spraying
programs, as Colombia does with marijuana.

   Heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson and actress
Robin Givens have discussed dissolving their stormy nine-month
marriage with a quick divorce in the Dominican Republic, Tyson's
lawyer said.
   Tyson, 22, is eager to ``get on with his life,'' lawyer Howard
Weitzman told the New York Post in Saturday's editions.
   Lawyers for Miss Givens, 23, and Tyson met Nov. 6 in Las Vegas to
discuss the possibility of filing for a divorce on the Caribbean
island, where divorces can be obtained in about two days, the
newspaper reported.
   Weitzman said an offshore divorce would be quicker than the
annulment request Tyson filed Oct. 14 in New Jersey, which could
take a year to resolve.
   Tyson claimed that Miss Givens, an actress on the ABC-TV series
``Head of the Class,'' manipulated him into marriage by saying
falsely that she was pregnant.

   The five astronauts scheduled to fly
a classified military space shuttle mission late this month arrived
here Saturday for training and a countdown test.
   ``It's going to be a busy couple days,'' commander Robert Gibson
told reporters after he and his fellow crewmen flew in from their
training base in Houston.
   Asked if NASA had set a launch date for the secret mission aboard
the shuttle Atlantis, Gibson replied: ``We're still marching toward
the 28th, but there's a possibility of a couple days the other side
of that.''
   Actually, those ``couple days'' already have been added, with the
range schedule now listing the launch date as Nov. 30. Shuttle
managers will set a firm date Wednesday following a two-day flight
readiness review.
   Gibson said his crew is ``very excited'' about the flight, much
of which is cloaked in secrecy because of its military nature.
   Sources have reported the astronauts will deploy a huge Defense
Department intelligence-gathering satellite that will fly over 80
percent of the Soviet Union.
   The exact launch time and length of the mission are classified.
After Atlantis reaches orbit, there will be a blackout on
information until the end of the flight.
   Following the astronauts' arrival, Gibson and pilot Guy Gardner
scheduled practice landing approaches on a runway here in a jet
plane equipped to handle like a shuttle.
   The three mission specialists, Mike Mullane, Jerry Ross and
William Shepherd, planned to rehearse driving a tank-like vehicle
the astronauts would use in case they had to make an emergency
escape from a launch pad problem.
   On Sunday, the crew planned to rehearse other emergency
procedures at the launch pad and on Monday they will board Atlantis'
cabin for the final two hours of a countdown rehearsal.

   Marc Bruynickx, 24, and Peter Vinck, 25, were found guilty of
setting fire to publicity banners during the Nov. 10 match at
Monaco's Louis II Stadium, the French news agency said.
   In addition to the three month jail term, the two men were fined
$825 each by the Monaco court Friday, AFP said.
   No injuries were reported during the incident, which occurred
during a game between Monaco and the team from Bruges, Belgium.
   Police and firefighters turned heavy-duty hoses on a group of
Belgian supporters to disperse the group and extinguished the fire.
Monaco won the match 6-1.

<HEAD>Suspended Sentence Sought For Attempted Killing Of Comatose Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DORDRECHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of a woman who tried to
kill her comatose son has drawn widespread interest in this nation,
which has a tolerant attitude toward mercy killing.
   On Thursday, a prosecutor in this western Dutch city recommended
a suspended one-year prison term against the woman, who was
convicted of trying to cut the carotid artery of her 20-year-old
son, Patrick, in February.
   Her son has been in a coma for 16 years.
   The defendant was only identified as 44-year-old Philippine G. in
line with Dutch judicial practice.
   Although euthanasia is formally banned by Netherlands law, an
estimated 5,000 cases occur annually, according to figures provided
by the Royal Medical Association.
   In recent years, Dutch courts have meted out token sentences to
doctors who performed acts of euthanasia on terminally ill patients,
as long as the cases met unofficial guidelines.
   Under those guidelines, euthanasia is allowed at the explicit
request of a patient if a terminal illness causes ``unbearable
suffering.''
   Premier Ruud Lubbers' center-right government is preparing
legislation that will allow euthanasia by medical professionals
under certain circumstances. A parliamentary debate on the issue is
expected next year.
   In the case in Dordrecht, the woman acknowledged she attempted to
end her son's life, according to court documents.
   ``His suffering had become intolerable,'' the woman was quoted as
saying.
   She told the court that she did not want to involve a doctor
because ``I wanted to bear the responsibility for this act alone.''
   Patrick has been in a nursing home since he fell through the ice
of a pond in 1971 and was pulled from the water unconscious. Three
days after the accident, his doctors removed him from a respirator
because they detected no brain activity. However, Patrick continued
to breathe.
   On Feb. 5, Philippine G. went to the nursing home with a razor
blade intending to kill her son, she told the court.
   ``I went to his room, held his hand and told him that I had to
hurt him a little bit,'' she was quoted as saying.
   But she failed to locate her son's carotid artery, and only
inflicted minor wounds before a nurse found her, the court documents
said.
   A ruling on the sentence is expected within two weeks.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address, by House Speaker Jim Wright
of Texas:
   The campaign is behind us and the season of Thanksgiving and
Christmas lies ahead. In the process which has served us so well for
two hundred years, the American people have chosen a new President
and a new Congress.
   First of all, let me offer my sincere congratulations to
President-Elect George Bush. He will assume enormous
responsibilities for us. And he deserves to have the prayers and the
help of us all.
   There is a venerable and generous tradition in American politics
that after the clash of the campaign both sides accept the verdict
cheerfully and join hands to pursue the goals of peace and
prosperity for which all Americans yearn.
   Let me express my thanks to the American people for the vote of
confidence by which they returned a strong Democratic Congress with
increased majorities in both House and Senate.
   This is the first time in eighty years, since l908, that the
American people have elected a president of one party while
enlarging the majority for the other party in both House and Senate
and in the governors' offices throughout the country.
   And so, if there is any clear mandate, perhaps the American
people are telling both parties, both President and Congress, to
work together to achieve those things that so desperately need to be
done for our whole country.
   There are areas in which we have substantial agreement. Mr. Bush
spoke during the campaign of a kinder, gentler nation. We would like
very much to help him achieve that goal. I hope we can develop a
harmonious working relationship. And as Speaker of the House, I
pledge my best efforts toward that end.
   It was refreshing to hear Mr. Bush pledge to become an education
president. And to the extent that he wishes to follow through on
that pledge, I assure him that Congress will enthusiastically help
to the end that America may be number one again in education. And
higher education may be placed within the financial reach of all of
our young people.
   Mr. Bush has also promised to do more to clean up our living
environment. We know that this pledge includes not just Boston
Harbor, but all the other polluted harbors and rivers and lakes that
threaten the public health. And, as he pursues that goal, I promise
that Mr. Bush will find strong bipartisan support in Congress.
   The President-elect said several weeks ago that he favors raising
the minimum wage. And, that was good news for millions of low-income
Americans who earn the bare minimum which has not increased in
almost eight years. Congress will help him do that.
   The Congress also looks forward to working with the Bush
administration to improve the quality and availability of safe and
wholesome day care facilities for working mothers _ to which he has
expressed personal commitment. These will make a fine start towards
that kinder, gentler nation.
   And, so for today, let's lay aside those things that have divided
us, and think instead upon those bigger things that unite us. In
these areas on which we already agree, let's come together quickly,
and get the job done. In those areas where we may disagree, let us
start the opening the doors of our minds to search for common ground.
   Centuries ago, an ancient Greek named Aristophanes walked among
the ruins of the Greek temple devastated by the Peloponnesian wars.
He ordered this prayer: ``From the murmur and subtlety of suspicion,
with which we vex one another _ give us rest, make a new beginning.
Mingle again the kindred nations in the alchemy of love, and with
some finer essence of forbearance, temper our minds.''
   Those are good words for us today. After the close of the 100th
Congress, and as together working within this constitutional system,
we embark upon our third century of American government.

<HEAD>Reagan Reflects on Peaceful Transition of Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Saturday the peaceful
transition of power in America is ``cause for us to wonder at our
freedom'' and to be grateful to veterans of the nation's wars.
   ``In the 10 weeks before Jan. 20, 1989, we the people can take
pride in just how strong our political system really is,'' Reagan
said in his weekly radio address, delivered from Camp David.
   ``We take it for granted sometimes, but I couldn't help thinking
on Tuesday night how inspiring it is that we Americans can choose
our leader without fear of violence,'' the president said.
   ``We have made our choice, and life goes on. We don't even need
to give it a second thought, but when we do, I think it's cause for
us to wonder at our freedom.''
   Mixing reflections on the transition with commemoration of his
last Veterans' Day weekend as president, Reagan said, ``We continue
to enjoy our freedom because of those brave Americans who have
legitimately taken up arms in the service of their country.''
   Reagan also repeated a note he has sounded often as he spoke on
behalf of Vice President Bush's successful campaign for the
presidency, saying that ``if there is one change George Bush and I
made that touches me most profoundly it would probably be this: Once
again our young men and women are proud to wear the uniform of their
country.''
   The president did not elaborate on the remark, but has often
boasted that his administration rebuilt American military might
after a period of neglect. Reagan took office in 1981, succeeding
Democrat Jimmy Carter.
   Reagan also took issue with some critics who say that Bush does
not have a strong mandate because issues were not spelled out
clearly enough during the campaign.
   ``George Bush has gotten his mandate from the American people, a
mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace and
prosperity to the American people, to bring hope and opportunity to
all Americans and to expand the frontiers of freedom around the
world,'' the president said.
   In the Democrats' weekly broadcast response, House Speaker Jim
Wright extended congratulations to Bush and thanked voters for
increasing the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate.
   He noted it was the first time since 1908 that Americans have
elected a president of one party and at the same time increased the
majority for the other party in the House, Senate and governor's
offices across the country.
   ``And so, if there is any clear mandate, perhaps the American
people are telling both parties _ both president and Congress _ to
work together to achieve those things that so desperately need to be
done for our whole country,'' he said.
   Wright, D-Texas, said Democrats would like to help him achieve
his goal of making America a ``kinder, gentler nation.''
   The speaker said Bush will find bipartisan support in Congress on
several of his campaign promises. He mentioned specifically Bush's
pledges to become an ``education president,'' to clean up the
environment, raise the minimum wage and improve the quality and
availability of day-care facilities.
   ``These will make a fine start toward that `kinder, gentler
nation,''' Wright said.

   The $4.4 billion ``super collider'' atom
smasher will be the latest, and maybe the last, link in a chain of
probes of nature's basic secrets that began with window glass and
sealing wax at the University of California 58 years ago.
   When asked what good is such a machine, some physicists like to
respond with the answer of Michael Faraday, who discovered the basic
laws of electricity, to Queen Victoria when she asked for an
explanation of his experiments:
   ``Madam, of what use is a newborn baby?''
   The collider will smash beams of protons into each other at a
collision energy of 40 trillion electron volts, 20 times what is now
possible at the most powerful existing machine, the
four-miles-around ``tevatron'' at the Fermi National Laboratory near
Chicago. The Energy Department announced last week it would like to
put the installation at Waxahachie, Texas, near Dallas.
   The point of the collisions is to see what new particles are
produced by this extreme energy in such a small space that it will
match the energy density of the postulated ``big bang'' creation of
the universe some 20 billion years ago.
   The appearance of the right particles will tell scientists
whether their latest theories on the origin of the universe are on
track.
   There are no other ways to test these theories. Cosmic rays might
create the target particles _ but they are so rare that scientists
might have to wait years for the right event, and then years for
another.
   The collider's beam current will be 2 amperes at peaks _ not
particularly high for a modern accelerator, but so tightly focused
that the collisions should provide 100 to 1,000 times more particles
to investigate than the best of today's machines.
   The protons, moving close to the speed of light, are bent in
nearly circular paths in vacuum pipes by 10,000 extremely strong
magnets, with fields 66,000 times as strong as the earth's magnetic
field.
   With weaker magnets, the collider would have to be far bigger _
100 miles around.
   The use of magnets is the innovation of Ernest O. Lawrence at the
University of California.
   Lawrence adapted an idea of a Norwegian physicist, Rolf Wideroe,
who used an electric field to accelerate ions through a tube, then
reversed the field to accelerate the ions again to their point of
origin.
   Straight-line accelerators are still used _ Stanford University
is bringing a new one on line.
   But Lawrence wanted to give his ions many accelerations to reach
extremely high energies, and realized the way to do it was to use a
magnetic field to bend the ion path 180 degrees between applications
of an electric field. With each kick from the electric field, the
ion moved to a larger semicircular path, up to the limits of the
size of the vacuum container used.
   In his 1986 history of 20th-century particle physics, ``Inward
Bound,'' Rockefeller University physicist Abraham Pais described
Lawrence's first machine, assembled by a graduate student in the
spring of 1930: ``The vacuum chamber, made at first of pieces of
window pane, scraps of brass and an overcoat of wax, fitted between
the 4-inch-diameter poles of a spectroscopist's magnet.''
   From then on, machines continually increased in energy and new
techniques were developed to focus the beams. One major change was
the introduction of electromagnets and fixed circular paths, with
the magnetic field growing as the particle accelerated to confine
the particle to the chosen path.
   The tevatron near Chicago and a smaller machine at Michigan State
University introduced a major advance: the use of superconductors to
power the electromagnets. This means the cables have no electrical
resistance, and no power is wasted heating the magnets.
   The tevatron illustrates the long gestation of modern
instruments. Construction of a 200 billion electron volt accelerator
was recommended by an advisory panel in 1963. In 1966, after much
competition, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences
recommended the Illinois site.
   There have been reports that President Johnson used the
accelerator in political trading with Sen. Everett Dirksen, R-Ill.
   Competition for the super collider was just as intense _ 25
states proposed 35 sites _ and losing states have charged that the
selection of Texas was motivated by politics _ the desire to please
the new president-elect and to enlist powerful Texans in Congress to
win the appropriations necessary.
   It took until 1972, nine years after the first recommendation, to
win funds from Congress and build the Illinois machine, which has
been upgraded since. Congress still hasn't appropriated construction
funds for the super collider.
   The Texas collider was recommended by a committee of physicists
in 1983 ``only after an agonizing decision to abandon several other
funding requests for particle accelerators,'' wrote three of its
designers, David Jackson, Murray Tigner and Stanley Wojcicki.
   It was in the same year that the world was shown again what
modern accelerators do: The Geneva, Switzerland, machine operated by
a consortium of European nations found the W-particle, the
``intermediate vector boson'' predicted by a theory published in
1967.
   In an illustration of the international complexity of modern
science, the discovery was made by a team led by Carlo Rubbia, an
Italian who is professor of physics at Harvard University in
Cambridge, Mass., and now director of the Geneva installation.
   Keeping ahead of the Europeans is what drives U.S. physicists,
and their government patrons. Energy Secretary John Herrington, in
announcing the choice of Texas, said, ``Most of the leadership in
high-energy physics is headed for Europe. We need to keep those
people in the United States.''
   After the 1983 recommendation, the Energy Department commissioned
a collider design completed in 1986. Basically, it scales up the
tevatron and involves no new technology.
   The Reagan administration didn't decide to try to build the super
collider until January 1987, setting off the scramble among states
to land an economic plum _ 3,500 or more construction jobs, a
permanent staff of 3,000 and a $270 million annual operating budget.

<HEAD>Soviet Shuttle Takes Maiden Flight Tuesday; Cosmonauts Set
Endurance Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Soviet cosmonauts broke a 326-day record for
endurance in space Saturday, and the official news agency Tass
announced that a second try to launch the Soviet space shuttle will
take place Tuesday.
   The first attempt to launch the shuttle Buran, on Oct. 29, ended
51 seconds before scheduled lift-off when a piece of equipment on
the launch pad failed to move away from the unmanned craft.
   Tass said the two cosmonauts on the space station Mir _ flight
commander Vladimir Titov, 41, and engineer Musa Manarov, 37 _ broke
last year's record established by colleague Yuri Romanenko.
   Titov and Manarov were reported healthy with only small changes
in their weight and muscle measurements.
   Scientists worry about atrophy when humans spend long periods in
zero gravity in space using just a fraction of their strength.
   The Buran space shuttle is due to lift off at 6 a.m. Tuesday (10
p.m. EST Monday). If the unmanned double orbit is successful,
officials will begin planning routine flights with a crew, Tass said.
   However, Soviet authorities said the Buran and its sister ships
will shoot off into space ``no more than two to four times a year.''
   Tass did not clarify whether that meant each shuttle would fly
only four times a year or whether the entire fleet would make just
four flights a year.
   Alexander I. Dunaev, director of the Soviet commercial space
agency Glavkosmos, said several shuttles are under construction.
   The Soviets have not said how many shuttles they plan to build.
But they will continue to use simpler, less expensive rockets to put
satellites into orbit, and save the shuttles for repair and hauling
cargo to the Mir space station.
   Buran, which means ``snowstorm'' in Russian, will circle the
earth twice on its first flight, and land at a specially constructed
runway back at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Kazakhstan in
Central Asia.
   ``The cause of the delay has now been eliminated and the Energia
(booster rocket) system with the Buran orbiter is undergoing
pre-launch preparations,'' Tass reported.
   The two cosmonauts on the space station Mir _ Titov and Manarov _
will get some company for their last month in orbit when two Soviet
colleagues and a Frenchman join them Nov. 26, Tass said. On Dec. 21,
Titov and Manarov will end their year in space by flying home with
the French cosmonaut, leaving their two Soviet colleagues in space.
   Titov has lost 4.4 pounds in space, and Manarov gained 3.3
pounds, Tass said.
   The U.S. record for the longest manned mission is 84 days, set in
1973 by astronauts Gerald Carr, Edward Gibson and William Pogue
aboard space station Skylab.

<HEAD>Lead Levels at Skagway Ore Terminal Higher Than First Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lead levels in soil at a Skagway ore
terminal are up to twice as high as originally reported and
environmentalists have accused state officials of withholding
details about toxic contamination for years.
   A state environmental official on Friday confirmed that he wrote
a memo on Nov. 1 saying concentrations approached 60,000 parts per
million, or 1,200 times normal levels, rather than the 28,000 parts
per million announced by the terminal operator Nov. 4.
   Dozens of residents, including most of the children and pregnant
women in the southeast Alaska town, gave blood and urine samples
last week at the state's request. Officials say the tests will
confirm whether the high lead levels pose a health threat to the
town's 790 residents.
   ``The situation is certainly serious as the numbers are very
high,'' Dick Stokes, southeast regional supervisor for the state
Department of Environmental Conservation, wrote in the Nov. 1 memo
to department Commissioner Dennis Kelso. ``The anxiety level in
Skagway will also be high.''
   ``Concentrations of lead in soil samples far exceed levels at
which the EPA has recommended or taken action in the past,'' Stokes
wrote. ``For areas where children are exposed such a level for lead
is 500-1,000 parts per million.''
   Levels of other metals at the terminal, including arsenic,
cadmium and mercury, also ``exceed EPA action levels,'' the memo
says.
   At a news conference Nov. 4, an environmental consultant hired by
terminal operator Bowhead Equipment Co. said preliminary tests
showed soil levels up to 28,000 parts per million _ more than 560
times the level naturally found in Skagway's soil. Stokes was at the
conference did not dispute the company's numbers.
   ``I do remember at one time in the press conference being nervous
that you (reporters) were not getting the high figure for lead from
the company,'' Stokes said, although he denied any attempt to
supress the information and noted that his memo was part of the
public record.
   A representative of the Sierra Club charged Friday that state
officials had withheld information on the extent of pollution in
Skagway for years.
   ``The air, waters, streets, even kids' sandboxes are contaminated
with hazardous waste ... at levels hundreds of times above that
known to place people at risk,'' said Carl Reller of the
environmental group's Juneau chapter. ``Essential information is
being withheld even today by both state officials and private
companies.''
   Stokes called that conclusion ``scientifically irresponsible.''
   ``I certainly don't think we've downplayed it,'' he said. ``The
intent has been to give out responsible numbers.
   ``We certainly didn't want to blast out the worst possible
picture,'' he said. ``We didn't want any panic in Skagway, that was
for sure.''
   Officials also are uncertain how easily lead sulfide in soil is
absorbed by humans, Stokes said. Most cleanups have involved sites,
such as smelters, contaminated by processed lead.
   The soil tests were conducted by Bowhead after the EPA ordered
the operator last summer to stop the spread of lead and zinc ore
concentrate at the site.
   For 20 years, the powdery concentrate has been transported
through town to the shipping terminal at Skagway Harbor. Since the
early 1980s, officials have known that lead sulfide polluted the
harbor. Skagway is about 90 miles north of Juneau.
   Terminal workers swept the ore off the dock for years. The gusty
winds of the Taiya River valley also spread the ore, but officials
did not consider the threat of lead in the soil until recently.
   A November 1985 state memo noted that ``the bottom sediments in
the Skagway Harbor have been found to be among the most toxic in the
world.''

   Israel closed the occupied territories, confined
680,000 residents to their homes, cut telephone lines and made
arrests Saturday in an attempt to prevent protests during a major
meeting of Palestinian leaders.
   At least two Arabs were shot and wounded in the Gaza Strip,
hospital officials said.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament in exile,
was expected to declare an independent Palestinian state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip during a four-day meeting that convened Saturday
in Algeria.
   Underground Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories
called for increased protests during the meeting.
   Troops entered dozens of villages and towns during the night and
arrested a number of suspected activists, said an army spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He did not say how many arrests
were made.
   Nine Israeli-Arab citizens suspected of belonging to a PLO
guerrilla cell that threatened Arab collaborators with Israel were
arrested, Army Radio said.
   Soldiers armed with tear gas, grenade launchers and rifles kept a
tight check on the movements of Arabs in the alleys of East
Jerusalem and the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Ramallah.
   The army turned back Palestinian cars bound for Jerusalem, and
police used tear gas to break up a protest outside the Old City
walls, said police spokesman Rafi Levy. At least one Arab was
detained.
   Jerusalem closed all privately-run Arab schools for four days so
they would not turn into focal points of unrest, said a city
official who demanded anonymity. West Bank schools have been closed
for almost a year.
   Information from the occupied areas was limited because the army
barred reporters from entering and disconnected many telephone lines.
   In Bethlehem, troops checked residents' Israeli-issued identity
papers and ordered some Palestinians to return to their homes,
according to an Arab reporter who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A military helicopter and a small airplane circled above the
biblical city while soldiers on the ground seized cans of spray
paint from stores and covered pro-Palestinian slogans scrawled on
walls, the reporter said.
   Several stone-throwing clashes with youths were reported in the
West Bank city of Nablus, Army Radio said.
   ``We are keeping foot and mobile patrols continuously moving to
prevent any form of gathering whatsoever,'' said a police officer in
East Jerusalem who requested anonymity.
   In East Jerusalem and the West Bank, soldiers distributed
leaflets written in Arabic in which the army appealed to residents
to maintain order, said another Arab reporter who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``Don't deceive yourselves that the Palestine National Council
resolutions in Algeria have any weight in solving the regional
conflict,'' the leaflets said. ``They are only ink on paper ... We
ask you not to incite emotions.''
   The Gaza's 650,000 residents were confined to their homes all day
Saturday and another 30,000 residents of four West Bank towns and a
refugee camp were under curfew. Despite the restrictions, Gaza
youths took to the streets to set tires aflame and block roads, said
an Arab reporter there.
   Also in Gaza, a 20-year-old man from the Jabalia refugee camp was
shot in the hand and a 30-year-old man from the Sabra camp was shot
in the shoulder, hospital officials said.
   Nablus, the West Bank's largest city with 100,000 residents, was
declared a closed military area, meaning no one could leave or enter
the city limits, said the army spokesman.
   ``Today was quiet, that's a fact,'' the army spokesman said.
``But the test is not one day. We are still waiting.''
   He said he did not know when the restrictions would be lifted.
   On Dec. 8, 1987, the 1.5 million Palestinians living in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip began an uprising against Israeli control of the
lands captured from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   Thousands of Palestinians have been shot and wounded in the
11-month-old uprising, which has claimed the lives of 310 Arabs and
11 Israelis.

   John N. Mitchell was eulogized Saturday as
``not one who attracted fair-weather friends'' in a gathering of
friends that included former President Richard Nixon, his former law
partner and boss, and others from the Nixon administration.
   The former attorney general, who had won the Silver Star for
gallantry for his World War II Navy service, was buried with full
military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. Mitchell died
Wednesday at 75 after a heart attack.
   His bronze coffin, covered by the American flag, was borne on a
caisson pulled by six white horses as the Navy band played the Navy
hymn. Seven sailors fired three volleys that echoed through the huge
cemetery on a crisp, fall day; a bugler sounded taps.
   A neighboring grave holds the remains of Gregory ``Pappy''
Boyington, a Medal of Honor winner whose life Mitchell is credited
with saving, and nearby are the graves of heavyweight boxing
champion Joe Louis, actor Lee Marvin and Maxwell D. Taylor, a
four-star general.
   At St. Alban's Church, in the National Cathedral complex, Nixon
escorted Mitchell's long-time companion, Mary Gore Dean, down the
aisle. He did not take any part in the service and did not attend
the burial. Mrs. Nixon did not accompany the former president.
   The pallbearers included Mitchell's five grandsons by two
children from his first marriage.
   The list of mourners read like a Who's Who of the Nixon White
House years, including Robert Mardian, one of Mitchell's
co-defendants in the Watergate cover-up trial. Mardian's conviction
in that case was reversed by a higher court.
   Mitchell was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice and
served 19 months of a 2{-to-8 year prison sentence.
   H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, his other co-defendants in
that trial, did not attend the funeral. Nixon was one of 18
unindicted co-conspirators in the Watergate scandal.
   There was only one reference to the scandal that brought the
Nixon administration down.
   ``What he went through was the most unfair, cruel treatment of a
public figure in the history of this cynical city,'' said former
Nixon aide Richard A. Moore in the eulogy.
   ``It is said that you judge a man by the friends he makes and the
friends he keeps,'' said Moore. ``He made friends in every phase of
his life, in law, in government, in politics, in Washington and in
New York. John was not one who attracted fair weather friends.''
   The mourners included press secretary Ron Ziegler and an
assistant, Bruce Whelihan, speech writers Pat Buchanan and Bill
Safire, appointments secretary Dwight Chapin, counsel Leonard
Garment, Nixon secretary Rose Mary Woods, and Mitchell's successor
as attorney general, Richard Kleindienst.
   The ushers were Jack Brennan, a former Nixon military aide, who
had been Mitchell's partner in a business that owned and represented
small companies around the world; Rob Odle, an official of the
Committee to Re-elect the President when the Watergate burglary took
place; Tom Evans, a former Delaware congressman, and Jerris Leonard,
who was head of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.
   Moore finished his eulogy quoting a Mitchell response to a
reporter who asked what he wanted to be remembered for. ``Just say
John Mitchell was a stand-up guy,'' Moore said, adding: ``To me that
says it all.''

<HEAD>Army Rejects Guerrilla Truce, Calls It Propaganda</HEAD>

   The armed forces chief on
Saturday rejected a cease-fire announced by leftist guerrillas,
calling it a propaganda ploy aimed at Western Hemisphere diplomats
gathered here.
   ``The armed forces have a constitutional mission to carry out,
which is to combat subversion. I have not recieved any such orders
to suspend operations,'' Col. Rene Emilio Ponce told reporters
during a breakfast meeting.
   Marxist-led guerrillas who have been at war with the U.S.-backed
government for nine years said Friday they would halt all but
defense operations during the Organization of American States
general assembly.
   They said their truce would run from Sunday night through Friday,
the final day of the assembly. Foreign ministers and top diplomats
from 31 nations are in San Salvador for the meeting.
   Ponce said he didn't expect a major guerrilla offensive during
the assembly, which opens Monday. ``But since we never believe what
communists say, we will keep our guard up,'' he added.
   ``The subversives have temporarily changed their tactics, from
military-terrorist action to organization of mass protests in the
streets,'' said Ponce, who became head of the joint chiefs Nov. 1.
   Leftist labor, student and peasant organizations have announced a
series of protests, marches and rallies for the coming week.
   Ponce said government troops captured rebel plans for
anti-government activity that includes marches, sit-ins, church
takeovers and rallies.
   He said the plans for ``Operation Worm'' were taken in combat
about 10 miles northwest of the capital. Ponce said he had the rebel
documents with him, but he refused to show them to journalists.
   ``This mobilization is not distinct from the overall guerrilla
strategy, but one of its avenues,'' he said. ``It is intended to
demonstrate to the ministers that they (the guerrillas) enjoy a
popular support that in reality they do not have.''
   The rebels say the centrist, democratically elected
administration of President Jose Napoleon Duarte is a facade for a
repressive, military-dominated government. They demand formation of
what they call a government of broad popular participation, which
would include revolutionaries.
   Duarte insists the guerrillas first lay down their arms.
   The armed forces and police _ more in evidence than usual on city
streets _ are carrying out ``Operation America,'' to provide
security for the OAS meeting. The number of men involved is
classified, but sources said the operation comprised several
thousand.
   Secretary of State George Shultz is scheduled to attend the
inaugural session of the OAS general assembly. He will return to
Washington on Monday evening.
   The OAS agenda includes discussion of hemispheric issues
including Latin America's staggering foreign debt, drug smuggling
and human rights.
   The organization will also try to deal with its fiscal crisis. A
commission has recommended that the OAS budget be reduced by 30
percent and that its staff of 1,004 be reduced 25 percent.
   Most members of the group, including the United States, are far
behind in their dues.

   A retired army officer and a senior
government scientist have been arrested on suspicion of selling
defense secrets to foreign countries, the United News of India
reported Saturday.
   The news agency said R.S. Deol, a former brigadier in the Indian
army, and N.W. Nerurkar, a scientist working in the government's
electronics department, were arrested by officers of the Central
Bureau of Investigation.
   The report did not say who the men allegedly were spying for.
   UNI said Deol was arrested on Thursday and Nerurkar on Friday.
Both men appeared before a magistrate on Friday and were remanded to
custody, it said.
   Documents relating to helicopters and marked ``Top secret,'' and
some gold bars were recovered from Deol's residence on the eastern
outskirts of the capital, UNI said.
   A raid at Nerurkar's residence yielded documents related to
reports of battlefield surveillance radars tested by the Indian
army, UNI said.
   Under Indian law, people accused of espionage can be held up to
90 days without being charged.

   Jewish fundamentalists have broken out
of their tight-knit neighborhoods and self-imposed isolation in a
quest for political power that has alarmed a largely secular Israel.
   In the early years of the Jewish state, members of the
ultra-Orthodox movements of Judaism concentrated on rebuilding
communities nearly wiped out by the Holocaust.
   The task has been largely accomplished, and many fundamentalists
have now become involved in politics.
   ``By participating in the political process, these parties are
modernizing. They are breaking out of the ghetto,'' said Shmuel
Sandler, professor at the religious Bar Ilan University near Tel
Aviv. ``They want a piece of the national pie.''
   The Orthodox hope that gaining seats in the Knesset, or
parliament, and the Cabinet will help them put religion back into
the daily life of Israel, where about 75 percent of the 3.5 million
Jews are non-religious.
   In the Nov. 1 elections, four religious parties _ the Torah Flag,
the Shas, the Agudat Israel and the National Religious Party _
captured 15 percent of the 2.2 million votes and 18 pivotal seats in
the Knesset.
   The four parties hold the balance of power between the left-wing
Labor Party, which won 39 seats, and the right-wing Likud bloc,
which won 40 seats.
   Their new political spirit is illustrated by the Habad Hasidim _
the power behind the Agudat Israel party _ which has built a strong
missionary army to recruit non-religious Jews.
   ``We share our Judaism with all Jews,'' said Habad spokesman
Moshe Birke.
   Birke underlines Habad's acceptance of the outside world by
offering his guests cans of kosher Budweiser beer made in Israel
under rabbinical supervision.
   Habad followers hand out candles to soldiers in the field on the
Sabbath, visit families at home and urge Jewish students in bus
stations to wrap their arms in phylacteries, traditional prayer
straps, and worship.
   Kfar Habad, 12 miles inland from the pubs and non-kosher
restaurants of secular Tel Aviv, is a strict Orthodox village with
450 families, or about 2,700 people _ one of five such communities
in Israel.
   Habad, which claims a half-million supporters throughout the
world, has built a reputation for charitable acts. It takes in and
gives vocational training to children from broken homes, sponsors
community centers in poor neighborhoods and has built 25 synagogues
in Jerusalem alone.
   Hundreds of Habad followers were flown in from the United States
to help with the election campaign.
   The focus of the Habad movement is the Lubavitcher Rabbi Menachem
Mendel Schneerson, 86, who was born in Russia and lives in Brooklyn.
He is revered as a visionary with near-miraculous powers.
   Schneerson's followers in Kfar Habad have built a replica of the
rabbi's three-story New York headquarters that is so exact the red
bricks have been artificially weathered to match those on the
original building.
   Rabbi Schneerson's orders propelled Habad into politics for the
first time. Squadrons of volunteers canvassed neighborhoods,
promising the New York rabbi's personal blessings in exchange for
votes.
   ``We got 102,000 votes,'' Birke noted. That translated into five
Knesset seats for the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel, which got only
two seats in the last election in 1984.
   All the religious parties believe God gave the Jewish people the
Land of Israel, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel
occupied in 1967.
   The most dovish is Torah Flag, which supports giving up land if
it means saving lives.
   ``To give back land or not give back land is not relevant. We
need to strengthen the moral fiber of Israel,'' said Moshe Peretz,
spokesman for the six-seat Shas Party, or Torah Guardians. He said
the government should focus on problems such as drug abuse and
housing.
   The chief demand of Orthodox parties is to amend the Law of
Return, which provides automatic citizenship to any Jew. Current law
defines a Jew as someone born of a Jewish mother or converted to
Judaism.
   The Orthodox demand that conversions be approved by their branch
of Judaism, rather than the less traditional Conservative or Reform
movements.
   The religious parties have presented a long list of other demands
that also would affect life in Israel for non-religious Jews:
   _The Jewish Sabbath should be officially recognized as the
nation's day of rest. City councils should have the power to close
public places such as pubs, restaurants and soccer stadiums.
   _Kosher food should be served in all public restaurants,
eliminating pork, which is banned under Orthodox religious laws.
   _All schools should be assigned a rabbi.
   _Laws should be tightened on autopsies, archaeological digs and
Christian missionary activity. Orthodox laws ban autopsies.
   _Judges in rabbical courts, which oversee marriage and divorce,
should get the same salaries as civil court counterparts and their
rulings should be exempt from Supreme Court review.

   Grenade-throwing gunmen attacked a gold
mining town and surrounding ranches in northern Colombia, killing at
least 34 civilians and leaving 31 people injured, authorities said
Saturday.
   The state governor and an army general said 200 leftist
guerrillas carried out the attack, but a local mayor claimed it was
done by dozens of members of a right-wing death squad.
   The gunmen rode into Segovia during a thunderstorm Friday night
and blasted the telephone exchange, city hall, the main park, two
bars and a commercial establishment, authorities said.
   ``It was an ordinary weekend, with people talking in the park,
drinking in the bars, listening to music and enjoying themselves
when this criminal act was perpetrated, bringing pain and sadness to
many homes,'' Antonio Roldan Betancur, governor of Antioquia state,
told radio networks Caracol and RCN on Saturday.
   Authorities first reported that an army post also was attacked,
but RCN, without citing sources, later said it learned the army post
was not attacked.
   Segovia Mayor Rita Tobon Areiza, of the leftist Patriotic Union
Party, said gunmen first attacked ranches near the town and that
casualties outside of town could raise the death toll to 50.
   The mayor, interviewed by RCN, did not say if the gunmen were
guerrillas or a death squad.
   Betancur said the gunmen belonged to the leftist National
Liberation Army and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
   Leftist guerrillas have been fighting to overthrow the government
for 25 years and establish a Marxist state.
   Mayor Carlos Rojo of the nearby town of Remedios said the attack
on Segovia was by a right-wing death squad that has been active in
the area.
   Rojo is also a member of the Patriotic Union Party, which has
seen more than 600 of its members killed by right-wing death squads
in the last three years.
   RCN's station in Medellin, in northwest Colombia, reported it
received a telephone call from a man identifying himself as the
commander of National Liberation Army forces in the area of Segovia,
a town of 15,000 about 180 miles northwest of Bogota.
   The man, identifying himself as Commander Orlando, claimed the
attack was by a death squad, RCN said.
   In 1983, the bodies of 33 miners who had been shot were found in
a mine shaft near Remedios, 15 miles from Segovia. The Patriotic
Union said the miners were leftist sympathizers killed by a
right-wing death squad.
   The government is still investigating that massacre.
   Gov. Betancur said helicopters were sent from Puerto Berrio and
Medellin, the state capital, with reinforcements and medical help.
   Gen. Raul Rojas Cubillos, commander of the 14th Brigade, which is
based in Puerto Berrio, told RCN that ``subversives killed women and
even beggars.''
   The military chief said the attack took place during an
electrical storm that made it hard to move troops into Segovia,
located in the main gold-mining area of Colombia.
   The attack was the second-worst in recent years in Colombia. On
Aug. 23, 12 civilians, 12 police and 18 guerrillas died during an
attack on Saiza, 280 miles north of Bogota.
   In another guerrilla attack Friday, four Colombian marines were
injured by a mine near the town of Ovejas, 380 miles north of Bogota.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney's Aides Believe He Leaked Story on Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Staffers of U.S. Attorney Frank L. McNamara Jr.
believe that he was the source for a news story in June claiming
that Gov. Michael S. Dukakis was under investigation by the FBI, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   The allegations by sources in McNamara's office come during a
staff shake-up that some prosecutors say underscores growing
political partisanship in the office, The Boston Globe reported.
   There was no answer Saturday at McNamara's office. When asked to
respond by the Globe, McNamara did not deny that he met with a
Washington Times reporter the day before the story appeared. But he
said ``I don't leak. ... I try to be as open as I can with
reporters, but I don't leak.''
   The June story said Dukakis was the subject of a probe into plans
to build a state prison in New Braintree. The FBI later denied that
Dukakis, then the front-runner for the Democratic presidential
nomination, was the subject of any investigation.
   The prison-siting probe was later dropped after a preliminary
inquiry.
   Unnamed sources cited by the Globe say they believe that
political considerations played a role in the recent demotion of
McNamara's first assistant U.S. attorney Richard Stearns.
   McNamara, a Republican appointed in 1987 by President Reagan,
demoted Stearns, 44, a liberal Democrat, to head major fraud cases.
   Stearns, who says he plans to resign as soon as he finds another
job, said McNamara gave no explanation for his reassignment other
than he (McNamara) needed to be with people he felt ``comfortable
with.''
   McNamara praised Stearns in a Globe interview and said, ``I
wouldn't characterize it as a demotion at all.''

<TEXT>
   The water along seven miles of ocean beaches
closed by a sewage spill was declared safe for swimming Saturday,
but health officials kept it off-limits at least through the weekend
as a precaution.
   The county Department of Health still wanted to test bacteria
levels in a creek that feeds the ocean and check a metal cap placed
over the outlet that spewed sewage for at least three days, said
health spokesman Jack Petralia.
   ``We want to play it safe for at least another day,'' he said.
   Authorities have been unable to say exactly how much sewage
spilled, but described it as a major flow. It caused bacteria levels
in the surf near the city's biggest recreational habor, Marina del
Rey, to rise to more than double the levels considered safe for
swimming, city biologist John Dorsey said.
   The discharge apparently was caused by the failure of a 30-inch
cap welded on an overflow sewer line about 15 miles inland,
according to Del Biagi, director of the city Bureau of Sanitation.
Biagi said he had ordered an inspection of 30 similar caps
throughout the city.
   Hundreds of youngsters who had Veterans Day off from school
headed for the sun-drenched beaches Friday, but lifeguards said most
heeded warnings to stay out of the contaminated stretch.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Defendant Guilty In Center City Stalker Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of being the ``Center City
Stalker'' has been convicted of robbery, assault and attempted rape
in 10 attacks on women in downtown office buildings.
   Reynard Gregory, 36, was found guilty Friday by jurors who
deliberated 10 to 12 hours after hearing 70 witnesses and being
shown more than 100 pieces of evidence.
   One of the stalker's victims wept when the verdict was read.
   ``I don't think I'll ever forget this,'' the woman told The
Philadelphia Inquirer, which did not use her name. ``I thought that
I'd be a lot happier. I really don't feel that good _ I feel sad.''
   For three months, the so-called stalker terrorized women who
lived or worked downtown. He hid in stairwells and hallways in
office buildings within six blocks of City Hall.
   He used tricks or force to get young victims into out-of-the-way
locations, where he would rob or sexually assault them.
   The defense contended that police arrested the wrong man because
officers were pressured to wrap up the case. Attorneys leaned
heavily on conflicting descriptions of the attacker from the 10
victims.
   Defense attorney Jerry Kristal told the jury that Gregory was the
victim of a police conspiracy carried out by ``three bad cops who
were given a mission to plant a seed that bore poisoned fruit.''
   Prosecutor Christopher Rooney characterized Gregory as a
compulsive sexual deviate.
   Gregory was charged in May with 45 counts of robbery, assault and
sexual violence in the 10 attacks between January and March.
   He faces a prison sentence of between 100 and 200 years, Rooney
said. In addition, he could be forced to serve the 12 years
remaining on an earlier conviction for stabbing a man to death on a
bus. Gregory was paroled on that conviction after serving 7{ years.
   ``Everybody can be assured that this guy will never get out of
jail to bother anybody again,'' the prosecutor said.

<HEAD>Pope Says Conscience Not Enough In Birth Control Decisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday rebuked
Catholics who say they are following their own conscience in using
artificial birth control.
   The pontiff also criticized theologians who have dissented from
the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on contraceptives, saying they
``make void the cross of Christ.''
   ``When Paul VI defined the contraceptive act as intrinsically
illicit, he meant that the moral norm does not admit exceptions: no
personal or social circumstance has ever been able, is able, or will
ever be able in itself to ordain such an act,'' the pope told 300
theologians from 34 nations at a conference on birth control.
   John Paul said that in the two decades since Pope Paul VI issued
``Humanae Vitae,'' the encyclical condemning artificial birth
control, many people have accepted the idea that their conscience
established moral principles.
   ``In this way, there has been a radical breakdown in the bond of
obedience to the holy will of the creator, which was the basis of
human dignity,'' the pope told the conference, which was called to
discuss moral theology on the 20th anniversary of ``Humanae Vitae.''
   John Paul said that whoever differed with church teaching because
of his or her own conscience rejected the Catholic concepts of moral
conscience and magisterium, or the church's authority.
   ``You can't say that a member of the faithful has carried out a
diligent investigation of the truth if he doesn't take into account
what the magisterium teaches; if, availing himself of any other
source of knowledge, he makes himself the judge; if, in doubt, he
follows his own opinion or that of theologians instead of the
teaching of the church,'' the pope said.
   Many Catholics, especially in developed countries such as the
United States, have ignored church teaching on contraception. U.S.
Roman Catholic bishops suggested in a draft letter released this
year that the church be more receptive toward women who used
artificial birth control.

<TEXT>
   Two Americans who illegally entered Laos
in search of American prisoners of war were freed Saturday after
their supporters paid $1,500 and canceled a protest at the Laotian
Embassy in Washington.
   Donna Long and James Copp, both of North Carolina, arrived in
Bangkok on a flight from Vientiane, the Laotian capital. They
appeared exhausted after 41 days of detention, 32 of them in
solitary confinement.
   The two entered communist Laos to advertise a reward offer for
the release of U.S. POWS from the Indochina war.
   ``It was a horrible 41 days, but I don't regret it,'' said Miss
Long, who lost 15 pounds. ``The only hope that our men in Laos have
is that someone brings them out.'' She said a stern-looking police
colonel told them that while they were being freed, any others who
entered Laos illegally would not be.
   ``They would stay forever, forever,'' she quoted the colonel as
saying.
   Miss Long, a 45-year-old writer from Jacksonville, N.C., and
Copp, a 44-year-old schoolteacher from Hampstead, N.C., were taken
into custody Oct. 3.
   They had sailed across the Mekong River boundary between Thailand
and Laos, entered a Laotian village, and distributed leaflets
advertising a $2.4 million reward for the return of any American war
prisoner. The reward has been pledged by 21 Republican congressmen
and some private citizens.
   Laos has denied holding prisoners from the war, from which U.S.
forces withdrew in 1973. Washington has criticized Miss Long and
Copp, saying what they did jeopardized official efforts to account
for 547 Americans listed as missing in action in Laos.
   When an angry policeman saw Miss Long and Copp in the village,
the two rushed down a hill and a Thai who was hired to navigate the
boat started the engine. But the policeman ordered him to cut the
engine. The Thai was released quickly.
   The Americans said they were kept in the village for a day, then
moved to Pakse city for a few days stay before being flown to
Vientiane.
   Upon landing, the two were put in a jeep manned by two men with
machine guns, who blindfolded them. They were driven into the garage
of what they later found out was the immigration building, a
five-minute walk from the U.S. Embassy.
   In the garage, they feared the worst.
   ``It got really dark,'' said Miss Long. ``Then everybody got out
of the jeep and the only people still in the jeep were us and the
two people with the guns behind us. I thought this was it, the big
one.''
   ``I thought we would be shot in the back of the head,'' Copp said.
   Instead they were taken up to their separate rooms to begin their
solitary confinement. In Pakse, the two had to sign statements that
they had intruded into Laos and caused problems.
   Miss Long said that in Vientiane, ``I was interrogated on
numerous occasions and they would take that statement and over and
over again ask the same questions. They wanted to know just about
everything. They kept asking me who is your boss and who sent you
here.''
   In her last session, on Oct. 29, they asked: ``Why do you help to
try to find criminals? American servicemen ... bombed our houses,
killed our people, people who did nothing to them. They are
criminals.''
   Miss Long said the police colonel complained people were
abandoning their work and searching for the American servicemen in
order to collect the reward. He said people were crossing the river
into Thailand to find out more about the reward.
   Miss Long said she spent her time exercising, singing, and making
things, including a deck of cards from cigarette packs to play
solitaire.
   Copp said a plant grew in the corner of his rat-infested room,
and at one point, he did not speak to anyone for two weeks.
   He said his trip into Laos ``wasn't a mistake. I'm more convinced
than ever that there are prisoners of war there.''
   Donald Stader, a State Department official, said in Washington on
Friday that Laotian authorities agreed to release the pair in return
for $1,500 in administrative costs.
   Another condition imposed by Laos, he said, was that a U.S.
veterans group cancel a demonstration it had planned for the Laotian
Embassy in Washington Friday to protest the detention.
   The National Steering Committee for American Vietnam War Veterans
canceled the protest and gave the $1,500 fee to Stader.

   Thousands of ancient artifacts collected
in 20 years from all over the world went on the auction block
Saturday, to help pay the legal expenses of a man accused of sexual
torture and murder.
   The first item to go, a New Guinea ancestral figure, brought
$200. A Sepik River ceremonial bone knife from New Guinea was sold
for $300.
   They and the other items _ believed to be worth several hundred
thousand dollars _ were collected by Bob Berdella, who ran a tiny
shop called the Bizarre Bazaar.
   Police found the artifacts _ from 2,000-year-old Roman vials
filled with tears to Peruvian cloth fragments to Tibetan exorcism
knives _ jumbled into boxes that were piled to the ceilings of
Berdella's midtown home.
   ``The police took out 1,000 boxes from house. They said the whole
house was just passageways between the boxes,'' said Pat O'Neill of
the public relations firm that coordinated the auction.
   Police were called to Berdella's house in June when a man ran
screaming from it wearing only a dog collar, saying he had been
sexually tortured for four days.
   Two skulls were found _ one buried in the back yard and another
in a second-floor closet _ and Berdella has pleaded guilty to one
murder and is charged in another.
   Police also found a packet of bones believed to be human
vertebrae and 200 pictures of nine bound men being tortured.
   Berdella, being held in the Jackson County jail, has kept close
watch on the auction.
   ``He called last night and again this morning,'' O'Neill said.
``He's watched a videotape and made suggestions that this should be
displayed a little more prominently or this should be pushed back a
little bit because it's not so valuable.''
   Browsers before the start of the four-day auction sifted among
fern fossils and large reptile bones. There were Phillippine and
Arabic brass bowls, and ancient coins from China, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Tibet and Japan.
   Costume masks from Sri Lanka and puppets from Asia and Thailand
lined one wall.
   There were Oriental necklaces, Tibetan necklaces, Kurdish beaded
necklaces and Roman beaded necklaces. A Sepik River statue from New
Guinea stood among several Buddhas.
   ``There are things from 16 million years ago to the present,''
said R. Bond Blackman, who spent four weeks appraising the 2,000
items. ``It is intercontinental, from New Guinea to Afghanistan and
Persia to Africa. Ancient beads, Iron Age cookware, things from
Rome, the Holy Land and Greece.''
   No rhyme or reason was apparent to the collection. A necklace
later determined to be 22-carat gold and valued at about $8,000 was
found mixed in a box of beads.
   ``He was eclectic,'' Blackman said. ``His own specific (interest)
was in beads. He liked to find and design jewelry. He would
duplicate jewelry from old pictures that he saw.''
   It was the jewelery that mostly drew people to Berdella's shop in
a flea market.
   About 200 people were in place Saturday when the auction got off
to a slow start. Auctioneer Gary Ryther of Excelsior Springs prodded
the buyers by telling them it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.
   Dr. Cotter Hirshberg of Topeka, Kan., waited for a ``Soul
Catcher'' from the northwest coast of India to come up for sale.
   ``It was used in healing ceremonies to keep the patient alive and
keep the soul from leaving,'' said Hirshberg, a collector. ``It also
was used to keep other souls who, shall I say, do not have a body,
from entering.''

   A police horse ran into a crowd of spectators
during a parade honoring the new Lord Mayor of London on Saturday,
and 10 people were slightly injured, police said.
   Three people were treated at the scene for shock and seven were
taken to St. Bartholemew's Hospital, where they were treated for
minor injuries and released, police said.
   The police officer momentarily lost control of his horse on
Chancery Lane, lined with crowds cheering Sir Christopher Collett as
he passed in a horse-drawn gold coach in the middle of a mile-long
procession.
   The 661st Lord Mayor of London, Collett received a blessing at
St. Paul's Cathedral and was sworn in at the Law Courts for a year's
term.
   The lord mayor rules over the City of London, a square-mile area
that was the heart of ancient London and now includes the capital's
financial district. He is elected annually from the members of the
city's Court of Alderman.
   The parade of glittering coaches, more than 70 floats, 18
marching bands and dozens of performers reflected Collett's chosen
theme, ``People Count.''
   ``My purpose this year is to focus attention on the activities of
people in the City, in the livery companies and in the corporation
of London _ because they all count,'' he said.
   During the Middle Ages, the craft guilds, or livery companies,
were established in the City of London and they remain a key part of
the city's business life today.

<TEXT>
   Primo Conti, a painter who was the last
major figure of Italy's futurist movement, died Saturday at age 88,
Italian news agencies reported.
   The artist reportedly died at his home in Fiesole, outside
Florence. The cause of death was not disclosed.
   Conti taught himself to paint as a teen-ager and was active in
the 1917-19 futurist movement, which used cubist techniques and
attempted to communicate movement by stressing the speed and flux of
the machine age.
   Conti later took up a more classical style, but returned to some
futurist principles after World War II.
   The painter also published poetry and an autobiography, and in
1985 established a foundation dedicated to avant-garde movements.
   Funeral services for Conti, who is survived by his wife and two
daughers, were scheduled Monday.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 250 supporters of former Atlanta
Journal-Constitution Editor Bill Kovach staged a mock jazz funeral
procession Saturday, then cheered a speaker as he blasted the
newspapers for accepting Kovach's resignation.
   ``Anne Cox Chambers, you should be ashamed,'' the crowd chanted
outside the newspapers' offices. Mrs. Chambers, a former ambassador
to Belgium, is the chairwoman of Atlanta Newspapers Inc. and
co-owner of its parent chain, Cox Enterprises Inc.
   Novelist Pat Conroy, whose novels include ``The Great Santini''
and ``Prince of Tides,'' offered to donate the profits of his next
book to Mrs. Chambers if she would rehire Kovach.
   ``If money is the sole reason she and the Cox chain exist on
Earth, then I'll be glad to give her more of it,'' Conroy said at a
rally behind the newspaper offices.
   Kovach, who watched from a short distance, said there is no
``realistic'' chance he would return to the newspapers and declined
to elaborate on his Nov. 4 resignation. He has said he and his
superiors differed on goals for the newspapers.
   Publisher Jay Smith said in a column published Saturday that
Kovach had frequently threatened to quit and finally departed when
Smith told him to stop engaging in ``backbiting'' with Cox
Newspapers' Washington bureau.
   The demonstrators accused the newspapers of being more interested
in profits than good journalism.
   ``Here lies the truth,'' was the message on the side of a
``coffin'' which was accompanied by a jazz band and effigies of Mrs.
Chambers, Smith and Cox Enterprises President David Easterly.
   Easterly's portrait resembled Clark Gable as Rhett Butler in
``Gone With The Wind.'' Several placards also used that theme,
including one which said, ``Frankly, my dear, we do give a damn,'' a
paraphrase of one of the film's best-known lines.
   Kovach, previously the Washington bureau chief for The New York
Times, was editor of the Atlanta papers for nearly two years and was
credited within the industry for making the papers more aggressive.
   Kovach said he had never been pressured not to run a story, and
said his differences with Smith were over substance, not style. He
declined to comment on Smith's account of the resignation.
   Journal-Constitution Managing Editor Glenn McCutchen, asked to
respond to the charges that the newspapers have sacrificed
integrity, cited Smith's column Saturday which pledged ``a continued
quest for daily excellence.''

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels Claim They Take Key Highway, Kill 20 Soviet Troops</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas claimed Saturday
they cut the strategic Salang Highway between the capital, Kabul,
and the Soviet Union in an offensive that killed 20 Soviet soldiers.
   Radio Moscow reported that the Soviet-backed Afghan army had
retaken another highway, a 72-mile route from Kabul eastward toward
the Pakistani border.
   The ``government army has regained control of the Kabul-Jalalabad
Highway,'' the radio said, adding that 1,358 rebels were killed in
fighting in the provinces of Nangarhar, Paktia, Helmand and Badghis.
   The claims could not be confirmed independently.
   The Jamiat-e-Islami rebel group claimed the Salang Highway was
closed. In the Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar, Jamiat spokesman
Mohammed Schweib said five guerrillas were killed in the fighting.
   The highway is the main route by which Soviet soldiers were
leaving Afghanistan under an accord calling for the withdrawal of
Soviet troops.
   Schweib said Moslem guerrillas staged repeated attacks along the
240-mile highway, which runs from Kabul to the Soviet border town of
Termez.
   Schweib said 20 Soviets were killed and 22 tanks destroyed in one
attack Nov. 6 on a convoy near the town of Rabatak in the northern
province of Baghlan, 90 miles south of the Soviet border.
   Schweib said the attacks on the Salang Highway in northern
Samangan, Baghlan and Parwan provinces have destroyed about 140
Soviet-Afghan military vehicles, including tanks, armored personnel
carriers and trucks.
   He did not elaborate on casualty figures.
   Last week, Jamiat leader Burhanuddin Rabbani discussed the Salang
offensive with reporters in Washington after meeting with President
Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Until the Salang offensive, rebels in the area had been letting
withdrawing Soviet troops leave unimpeded. But guerrilla leaders
said the introduction early this month of Soviet surface-to-surface
missiles and MiG-27 jets is tantamount to a renewed Soviet invasion.
   An accord signed in April provided for the withdrawal of Soviet
troops, and half the force left by Aug. 15.
   The timetable calls for completion of the withdrawal by Feb. 15.
But the Soviet Union said Nov. 4 it had suspended the withdrawal,
charging that the accord was being broken by the continued arming of
the insurgency by Pakistan and the United States. The Soviets said
the temporary suspension did not consititute a breach of the accord.
   In other developments, government-controlled Radio Kabul said
Saturday that 10 people were killed in attacks on two cities.
   The broadcast monitored in Islamabad said one person was killed
and another injured when a bomb exploded Saturday in Kabul.
   The radio said the device was planted by ``criminals,''
presumably Moslem insurgents who have been fighting the communist
government for 10 years.
   The broadcast said eight people were killed and 20 injured during
the past two days when surface-to-surface rockets hit residential
areas in Charikar, 30 miles north of Kabul.

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush, determined
not to make any news while he is on vacation, spent Saturday in the
surf and sun and used his private time to make phone calls and write
thank-you notes.
   Bush conferred briefly by telephone with his chief of staff,
Craig Fuller, who is leading the transition team that will put
together the Bush administration, said spokesman Steve Hart.
   Fuller and Bush campaign adviser Robert Teeter are working on
potential Cabinet nominations and other possible administration
appointments.
   The only information being disseminated officially by the Bush
staff on Saturday dealt with the president-elect's recreation
schedule and his letters and calls of thanks to people who had
helped in the campaign or congratulated him on winning the election.
   Hart was asked during a briefing Saturday what Bush had to say
about the dramatic drop in the stock market since the election and
the dollar's plunge to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen.
Analysts said the decline reflected worries about Bush's ability to
deal with the federal budget deficit.
   ``We won't have anything to say about that,'' Hart replied.
   Pressed further, Hart said: ``He's on vacation right now and I'm
sure he's aware of it and has his own thoughts on it, but it's not
something we'll be sharing with you.''
   Instead, Hart told about how Bush had surf-fished twice that day
for whiting, pompano and barracuda.
   He didn't catch anything, Hart noted, a fact verified at a
distance by reporters and photographers who staked out the beach
behind the oceanfront home of Bush's multimillionaire friend William
Stamps Farish III.
   Attired in blue shorts, a red, long-sleeved shirt and blue cap,
Bush went into the balmy waters up to his waist in an effort to land
a fish while Secret Service agents kept an eye on the beach.
   Bush's wife, Barbara, wearing white slacks and a blue striped
top, came out to watch, along with Farish's wife, Sarah, and
22-year-old daughter, Laura.
   Bush planned an afternoon nap and a game of golf.
   Hart said the president-elect was settling into a pattern for the
four-day vacation of recreation time in the afternoon and telephone
calls and writing in the morning.
   He said Bush telephoned several people Saturday morning to thank
them for their help in his campaign or for their congratulatory
calls and telegrams. Among them were comedian Bob Hope, California
Gov. George Deukmejian, New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers, former
Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, Indiana Gov. Robert Orr, Alabama
Gov. Guy Hunt and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
   Hart said Bush had decided not to dine out while staying in this
exclusive, palm tree-dotted community because of the security
measures that would be required.
   ``The idea is to keep the disruptiveness of this as little as
possible,'' Hart said.

<HEAD>Harvey Rosenfield: Nader Protege Comes Into Own With Insurance
Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As far as Harvey Rosenfield is
concerned, David had it easy against Goliath _ at least David had a
sling and five stones.
   Rosenfield started with only a few dollars and a cause in a fight
against the California insurance industry, and ended up a giant
slayer with his Proposition 103 ballot initiative to roll back
insurance rates more than 20 percent.
   The Ralph Nader protege said the initiative's victory in
Tuesday's election amounted to a voter revolt, with the message that
consumers will no longer tolerate high insurance rates and
ineffective politicians.
   ``This proves that you can fight city hall and win,'' he said in
his apartment Saturday. ``We've proven that word of mouth and a
grassroots campaign is far more powerful than all the slick
30-second TV ads that money can buy.''
   The insurance industry, which watched its $70 million campaign go
down the drain, immediately took its battle to the courts amid
threats to pull out of California and predictions of economic doom.
   The state Supreme Court temporarily froze the rate rollbacks for
motorists, businesses, homeowners and municipalities until it can
decide if the measure is constitutional.
   The prospect of another long and costly battle to implement
Proposition 103 left Rosenfield with little time to celebrate, but
he said he's confident that the movement he launched in 1986 will be
victorious in the end.
   ``Just like Proposition 13, the taxpayer rebellion that started
in California and spread through the nation, Proposition 103, the
voter revolt to cut insurance rates, will sweep the United States
like a prairie wildfire,'' he said.
   Rosenfield, 36, announced the drive to put Proposition 103 on the
ballot in November 1986 after an unsuccessful attempt to push
insurance reform through the Legislature.
   Rosenfield has been a staff attorney for Nader's Public Citizen
Congress Watch in Washington, D.C., and director of the California
Public Interest Research Group.
   If he's lucky, he'll make about $20,000 this year, a fraction of
what he figures individual classmates at Georgetown's law school
class of 1979 are making. But, he said, ``At least I'm having fun
and doing something good. I wonder if they can say that.''
   His Nader connection proved crucial to the campaign for
Proposition 103, one of five complicated insurance measures crowding
the longest and perhaps most confusing ballot in California history.
   Nader vigorously campaigned for Proposition 103, giving it
credibility among many voters and drawing the kind of publicity that
the campaign could not buy with its $2.3 million budget, Rosenfield
said.
   ``People were so interested in the demand for insurance reform
that they were looking for the right measure,'' said Rosenfield.
``People were asking who is behind these things. That's what the
whole thing came down to. There's no question that Ralph Nader's
integrity and commitment to consumers is so widely known and
universally share that voters trusted him.''
   The five measures, together with 24 other propositions, triggered
more than $130 million in campaign spending, about $70 million of it
by insurance companies. It was the most expensive campaign in the
country outside of a presidential race.
   Two big insurance companies, Allstate Insurance and Mercury
Casualty, said they would stop selling new liability policies in
California. Other companies said they might be forced to follow suit.
   But by Friday, Allstate and Mercury reversed themselves and took
a wait-and-see stand.
   Two state senators threatened to press for multimillion-dollar
penalties if companies flee the state.
   In the meantime, Rosenfield and his supporters at Voter Revolt to
Cut Insurance Rates plan their next moves.
   ``Voter Revolt will stay around and try to raise money to enforce
Proposition 103, fight the legal attack in court, and make sure it's
enforced fairly by the insurance commissioner,'' he said. ``We're
still going.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee accused the Reagan administration on Saturday of timing
foreclosure warnings to hit about 90,000 farms just after the
election.
   However, the head of the Agriculture Department agency involved
denied the charge and said the regulations involved were too complex
to have been completed earlier.
   The notices will tell delinquent borrowers from the Farmers Home
Administration that they are seriously behind in their payments,
should start considering their options and tell FmHA within 45 days
what they want to do. The notices will lay out the options farmers
may pursue.
   Those options, under 1987 legislation signed by President Reagan
early in 1988, permit the FmHA under some circumstances to write
down some debts or to grant new terms. The legislation required a
major reorganization of FmHA programs, including the notices to
delinquent borrowers.
   ``Giving the administration the benefit of every doubt, the
notices could have gone out by Labor Day,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   Draft regulations were published for comment Sept. 14, to take
effect Nov. 14, which is Monday. FmHA officials said in late October
they expected to begin mailing the notices soon after Nov. 14, and
Leahy said he tried to bring this out in campaign appearances in
farm states on behalf of fellow Democrats.
   ``There's no question in my mind it was deliberately held off''
so the notices would follow the presidential election but precede
the return of Congress and inauguration of the new president, Leahy
said.
   But Vance L. Clark, head of the FmHA, said the timing ``had
nothing to do with the election.''
   ``We had a tremendous job in training field people to make these
regulations work and we had to scrub the list to make sure it was
clean,'' Clark said.
   ``Sometimes Congress doesn't realize what it has wrought,'' Clark
said, calling it ``the most complex regulation we've ever had to
publish.''
   ``We tried, but we just couldn't'' publish the regulation sooner,
he said.
   The regulation takes up 160 pages in a special section of the
Sept. 14 Federal Register.
   FmHA estimates it has $8.8 billion in past-due loans. The agency
lends to the shakiest of the nation's 2.16 million farmers, those
who cannot get credit through normal commercial channels.

   Marching bands played, champagne corks
popped and residents gleefully speculated what they could get for
their property when they learned they'd be neighbors of the new
``super collider.''
   But real estate agents Saturday warned that any property value
increases would be slow in coming.
   ``The thing that we have tried to do is be realistic with our
sellers,'' said Lucille Boardman, broker associate with Merrill
Lynch Realty in DeSoto, between Waxahachie and Dallas. ``We don't
see any getting rich quick.''
   Energy Secretary John Herrington announced the selection Thursday
of Ellis County, south of Dallas, as the home for the $4.4 billion
atom smasher, a 53-mile tunnel scientists hope will give an
unprecedented view of the basic structure of matter.
   Waxahachie, a town of small buildings and 18,000 residents that
is seat of primarily agricultural Ellis County, will be encircled by
the super collider.
   The giant science project is expected to result in 4,000
construction jobs and 3,500 permanent jobs. The project will take
eight years to build; the Energy Department hopes to complete it in
1996.
   But deficit reduction pressures will toughen the fight to fund
the super collider, Texas congressional leaders warned.
   Real estate agents in Ellis County said that funding battle has
tempered some of the enthusiasm generated by Herrington's
announcement.
   ``Some of the homeowners feel there's going to be an immediate
appreciation,'' Ms. Boardman said. ``We feel it's going to be
gradual. They've got to get the funding first.''
   The city's economy is based largely on the region's cotton and
sorghum crops, but Hollywood has discovered Waxahachie, too.
``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``Tender Mercies,'' ``Places In The Heart,''
``True Stories'' and ``A Trip to Bountiful'' have all been shot in
or near the town.
   Waxahachie is a Tonkawa Indian word for ``buffalo creek.''
   The county blossomed in the early 1980s but not as much as its
northern neighbors, Dallas and Tarrant counties. Two years ago, the
largely rural area felt the blow of the Texas recession.
   ``Residential values have gone down significantly in the last two
years,'' said Dan Batte, sales associate with Lowry and Associates
in Waxahachie. ``Raw land and commercial values have been real flat.
... We've had almost no sales of raw land near Waxahachie for the
last 18 months to two years.''
   Vera Kamerbeek of the local Coldwell Banker office said many
property values in the area dropped between 6 percent to 8 percent
last year, but she hopes the prospect of the atom smasher will turn
that around.
   ``We think Texas has already bottomed out and it's only a matter
of how long it will stay at the bottom,'' she said. ``We've even had
a lot of calls from people out of state.''
   Elmer Nooner, 73, who has a real estate business in Waxahachie,
said there probably will be a lot of land sold soon.
   ``I just kind of think there will be a lot of speculation,'' he
said. ``People will want to move down from some other states and be
in on the action, and there will be some houses sold.''
   Batte said he had an appointment Saturday to show a Chicago
investor some land.
   ``Homeowners don't need to increase their prices yet,'' Batte
said. ``The people interested now are interested in raw land as an
investment.''
   A typical two- to three-bedroom home costs about $90,000, said
Edwin Farrar of the Coldwell Banker office.
   A real estate agent in Midlothian, a town of 5,200 between the
super collider and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, said
land values near the super collider campus may jump $500 an acre
once Congress approves funding for the project.
   But the agent, Janet Calvert of Ramsey, Ramsey and Associates,
said large tracts in the long term may jump from a current level of
about $4,000 an acre to $6,000.
   Doris Bratcher said she would cooperate with the government if it
needs her 25 acres on the outskirts of Waxahachie, but she doesn't
want to sell to a developer.
   ``It would have to be a lot more than most people could rig up
before I would sell,'' said Mrs. Bratcher, who raises cutting horses
with her husband.
   Molly Herrera, an employee at Waxahachie's Trinity Pharmacy, said
not everyone is excited about the super collider.
   ``Most of the old timers are not,'' Ms. Herrera said. ``It'll
just be a big mess.''
   ``You always have some who don't want them to mess with a little
gingerbread town,'' Nooner said.

<HEAD>Police Confiscate Garbage Disposal Believed Used On Body Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have confiscated a home garbage
disposal unit they say may have been used to dispose of parts of a
woman they suspect was murdered.
   ``We took out the whole thing (disposal) and sealed it up,'' said
homicide Detective Alvin ``Rusty'' Brown. ``We're going to run some
tests on it and see what we can find.
   The appliance was one of several items police took as evidence
Wednesday in their investigation of the possible death of
32-year-old Barbara Baughman.
   Police say they have received a tip that Ms. Baughman was
smothered or drowned in a bathtub last weekend and then dismembered.
   Police arrested her husband, Thomas James Fisher, 41, and charged
him with murder. He remained in jail Saturday under $1 million bond.
   During the search of the house, police said, they discovered
evidence that blood had been leaned up, leading them to believe Ms.
Baughman had been killed there.
   ``We're kind of letting the people with the chemistry sets work
on it,'' Brown said. ``There are a number of chemical tests being
done on this one. Hopefully, some of those tests will lead us to
some type of conclusion.''
   Earlier in the week, police found what they believed were
scorched fragments of fingers in an alley. Investigators with the
Bexar County Medical Examiner's office recovered about 25 small
fragments and were conducting tests to determine if they were pieces
of human flesh.
   Officers searched several areas of the city for body parts, Brown
said.
   ``There are indications of the body being dumped somewhere,''
Brown said. ``We've searched several specific areas of town, but
have not found the body.''
   Brown said Ms. Baughman and Fisher had lived in the house for
about eight months.
   Ms. Baughman was unemployed, Brown said. Her parents, Robert and
Velma Baughman of Schertz told police they had not seen her in eight
years.
   Police said Fisher, who records show is a New York native, was
employed as a salesman for a home improvement contractor.

<HEAD>Magazine: Astronauts May Have Survived Blast, Died On Impact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crew aboard the space shuttle Challenger, which
exploded 72 seconds into flight, may have survived the blast and
lived the two-and-a-half minutes it took the craft to crash into the
ocean, a magazine reported.
   Tropic, The Miami Herald's Sunday magazine, quoted anonymous NASA
investigators who said the seven crew members, including
schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, survived the blast and died only
when the cabin, possibly still pressurized, slammed into the
Atlantic Ocean at 200 mph.
   ``If it had landed softly, they could have swam home,'' said one
of the investigators.
   NASA has maintained the astronauts died the instant the
spacecraft exploded. The space agency also has said that if the crew
cabin had survived the blast intact, it would have been ripped apart
by aerodynamic forces upon its descent.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials declined
to comment when contacted Saturday by The Associated Press after
advance copies of the magazine became available.
   The magazine reported that no evidence was ever found that the
cabin lost pressure, and if it did, it did so slowly, without the
sudden, catastrophic loss of air that would have knocked the
astronauts out within seconds.
   The astronauts would have remained conscious long enough to catch
a glimpse of the ocean rushing toward them if the compartment was
losing pressure slowly, Tropic reported.
   The free-fall lasted about two-and-a-half minutes.
   NASA's official report indicated no cause of death could be
determined from the remains, which were found entangled in the
crushed cabin on the ocean floor nearly six weeks later.
   Death certificates issued from the Johnson Space Center in
Houston on Jan. 30, two days after the tragedy, certified that the
astronauts ``died when the shuttle spacecraft Challenger ...
exploded.''
   Dr. Ronald Reeves, chief assistant to the medical examiner in
Brevard County, where Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center
are located, told the magazine those certificates are useless
because of the date, and because they were not signed, as legally
required, by Florida authorities.
   Reeves says the public may never learn exactly how the astronauts
died because NASA intentionally kept the remains from Florida
pathologists, whose records would be public.
   ``The law doesn't say we're allowed to do the autopsies,'' Reeves
said. ``It says we are required to do them.
   ``The government does this kind of thing, always with no thought
as to the outcome.
   ``Look what happened with John F. Kennedy,'' he said. ``Instead
of doing the straightforward pathology work right there in Dallas,
they did all this cloak-and-dagger stuff and now, 23 years later,
there are questions that can never be answered _ questions that
shouldn't even exist, because if the autopsy had been done
correctly, they would all have been answered.''

<TEXT>
   Eighty-nine people who took refuge in a
cathedral building vowed Saturday to remain on a hunger strike until
demonstrators detained in opposition protests are freed, activists
said.
   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, meanwhile, said he had received
another invitation from Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak for
a meeting to remove obstacles to government-opposition talks on
Poland's future. He said he had not decided on a reply.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski said in a nationwide
television address Saturday night he believed the talks ``will in
fact take place,'' but he gave no indication when.
   Police and demonstrators clashed in at least six cities Friday
night as people chanting ``Independence!'' and ``Solidarity!''
marched to mark the 70th anniversary of the restoration of Polish
independence in 1918. Poles in major cities turned out by the
thousands in an outpouring of opposition sentiment.
   Demonstrations organized by Solidarity and the banned right-wing
opposition group Confederation for an Independent Poland were
reported in 14 cities. Some protesters chanted, ``The shipyard is
ours!'' a reference to plans to close the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk
where the Solidarity union federation was established in the fall of
1980.
   Solidarity was suspended by the commuinist authorities in
December 1981 and outlawed the following year.
   In the southern city of Katowice, 89 people were in a building
beside the Christ the King Cathedral where they had taken shelter
late Friday during fighting between police and protesters, activist
leaders reported.
   Adam Slomka, a member of the Confederation for an Independent
Poland who was among the protesters, said in a telephone interview
the group was receiving blankets and sleeping bags from sympathizers.
   Opposition spokesmen said about 250 people ran into the cathedral
complex after police attacked demonstrators with clubs. They said 89
began a hunger strike.
   The strikers are demanding the release of the detainees as well
as punishment for police who beat protesters and written assurances
that those in the cathedral building will not face repression,
activist Zygmunt Lenyk said.
   Another Solidarity spokesman, Wojciech Maziarski, said 18 people
were injured Friday night and 46 detained in confrontations with
police. A few of those detained were released Saturday, he said.
   Protests Friday also turned violent in Warsaw, Gdansk, Krakow,
Poznan and Tarnow, opposition spokesmen said.
   There was no immediate official word on the number of people
detained or injured in the confrontations nationwide, but it
appeared at least 100 were held for some time.

   A restaurant executive who used ``just the fax''
to advertise for dates plans to have a party and invite the nearly
2,000 women who responded.
   ``The whole experience has been unbelievable,'' said Paul
Hohendorf, catering executive at the Roostertail restaurant here.
   ``A lot of women seem intrigued because it's different,'' he said
Friday. ``We're all just having fun.''
   A story in Monday's Chicago Sun-Times described him as the man
who ``faxes for foxes.'' About 1,300 replies have been from within
Detroit, where he sent his first message via a ``fax'' machine,
which uses telephone lines to transmit facsimilies of documents.
   Women have responded by the hundreds, some sending pictures of
themselves in bikinis, halter tops and miniskirts.
   Hohendorf plans to fly to Chicago Nov. 21 for the party.
   While the flurry of messages has been an amusement to his
co-workers and his boss, it's not expected to last.
   ``This thing has taken over our office,'' said Tom Schoenith,
Hohendorf's boss. ``No one gets their work done because they're
reading messages. I think this will die down. Wait until he gets the

   Just as you are what you eat, archaeologist
William Rathje believes you are _ to a certain extent _ what you
throw away.
   Rathje has some of his students at the University of Arizona
learning more than they might want to know about garbage. They sift
through trash in Tucson and dig into landfills around the nation to
get the true picture of modern society _ or as Rathje puts it, ``to
see the American lifestyle from the back end.''
   ``We do run across some bad stuff, but you just put on your
gloves, hold your nose and get through it as fast as you can,'' said
Rathje, who spoke recently at a conference of the Ohio Alliance for
the Environment.
   Rathje said a lot can be learned about people and society from
what is thrown away. A lot of myths can be dispelled, too.
   One of those myths, he said, is that Americans eat everything on
their plates.
   ``The average household throws out 15 percent of the food it
buys. In Tucson, that is 950 tons of edible food a year,'' he said.
   ``We dug up a T-bone steak from 1970 that, I swear, if we brushed
the dirt off and cooked it, you would eat it,'' he said. His
students determined the steak came from 1970 by looking at
newspapers and other dated items nearby.

<HEAD>Snow And Rain, Some Heavy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wet snow fell across the upper Midwest on Saturday, making
driving treacherous, while rain fell from Texas to the Ohio Valley
and over the Northwest, where heavy snow fell in the mountains.
   A low pressure area over southern Iowa produced snow across much
of Minnesota and northern Wisconsin.
   In Minnesota, Brainerd reported 6 inches and St. Cloud, Duluth
and Forest Lake around 4 inches, the National Weather Service said.
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport reported about 2 inches.
   Wet, slushy roads sent some vehicles sliding into ditches but no
injuries were reported. Brief power outages were reported in the
Brainerd and Baxter areas.
   A band of showers and thunderstorms, developing ahead of a cold
front, extended from southern Illinois through southern Arkansas
into central Texas. Showers and thunderstorms also extended over
southeastern Texas and extreme southwestern Louisiana.
   Thunderstorms produced very heavy rain, with 3.20 inches reported
at Magnolia, Ark., and 3 inches at Plain Dealing, La. Atlanta,
Texas, received more than 4 inches during the morning. During the
six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, 2.63 inches fell at Texarkana, Texas,
and 1.22 inches fell at Hot Springs, Ark.
   Thunderstorms also produced wind gusts to 52 mph at Shreveport,
La.
   A cold front over the Pacific Northwest spread showers inland
into the Rockies, and rain fell as far south as San Francisco during
the morning.
   Snow fell at higher elevations of Washington and Oregon, closing
some roads through mountain passes in Washington.
   As much as 12 to 15 inches of snow was expected in the Cascade
mountains of Washington. Heavy snow also was expected over parts of
California, Nevada and Wyoming.
   ``Even the lowest pass, such as Snoqualmie Pass on Interstate 90,
will be affected,'' the weather service said in its first major
storm warning of the season in the Northwest.
   Winter storm watches were posted for Sunday over most of Nevada.
In northern California, a winter storm watch was posted for Sunday
in the northern Sierra Nevada and for the Shasta and Siskiyou
mountains.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 27
degrees at Yellowstone National Park to 86 degrees at Beeville,
Texas. Saturday morning's low was 14 degrees above zero at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Sunday, rain was forecast from northern Florida to New
England and the Great Lakes region, with thunderstorms in the
Southeast. A few showers were forecast over northern sections of the
Great Lakes region. Showers were forecast from much of the Pacific
Coast to western Montana, northern Utah and western Wyoming, with
snow at higher elevations.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted from the northern Pacific Coast
through North Dakota and the Great Lakes region to northern New
England; in the 40s and 50s from the northern and central Pacific
Coast through the Dakotas to the middle and northern Atlantic Coast;
above 70 from the desert Southwest through the southern Plains to
Florida and southern Georgia; and in the 80s across the Florida
Peninsula, southern Louisiana, southern Texas, extreme southern
Arizona and the southeastern corner of California.

<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, in a speech issued
Saturday, denounced the Soviet-led invasion that ousted him as
Czechoslovakia's Communist Party leader and said his nation needs
``a great popular leap'' forward.
   Dubcek is scheduled to give the speech Sunday at a ceremony in
which he will be honored for the reforms he introduced in 1968
during a period that became known as the ``Prague Spring.''
   He is on his first visit abroad since he was stripped of his
Communist Party membership in 1970, and he has expressed concern the
government might not let him return home because of his statements
in Italy.
   Speaking of the invasion in 1968 that crushed his reforms and
established a hardline government, Dubcek said in his prepared
speech:
   ``It is my firm conviction that without the external intervention
in the situation of our party and our Czechoslovak society, our
endeavor would have been crowned with success.''
   Dubcek is to receive an honorary degree in political science
Sunday from the University of Bologna, which is marking its 900th
birthday. The university made his speech available Saturday.
   Dubcek lamented the invasion but expressed hope that
Czechoslovakia will again try to introduce elements of democracy.
   ``It would be enough to have a great popular leap, which among
other things, was our movement of rebirth in 1968, in order that our
historical experiences so profoundly lived return to the surface and
be openly manifested,'' he wrote.
   Dubcek, who considers himself a communist although he was
stripped of party membership, said the last two decades in
Czechoslovakia were years of ``economic stagnation, sterility and
incalculable moral losses.''
   But he added he still had hope, saying: ``We are searching for
something that can open the path to new developments of socialism _
theoretical and practical.''
   ``In the Prague Spring, in its internal development and in its
suffocation by external forces, everything is reflected in condensed
form _ the crises and the possibilities of socialism,'' his speech
declared. ``In 1968 we learned that the key to overcome the crisis
doesn't only come in the economic sphere ... the key was, and
remains, in the political sphere.''
   The 66-year-old Dubcek arrived in Bologna Friday by car. He lives
in Bratislava and is retired from a lowly job in a forestry
department office that was assigned to him 18 years ago.
   Dubcek served for five months in 1970 as Czechoslovakia's
ambassador to Turkey but then was summoned back to Prague and ousted
him from the party. He had been removed as party leader in April
1969.
   Dubcek is expected to remain about 10 days in Italy visiting
Florence, Venice, Ravenna and possibly Rome. No schedule has been
released.

<HEAD>General, Former Chairman of Joint Chiefs, Dead at 89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer, a brilliant organizer and
diplomat who qualified as a parachutist at the age of 51 and rose to
become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, died Saturday in
Washington. He was 89.
   Lemnitzer, son of a Homesdale, Pa., shoe company executive, was
graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1920 and
entered the Army's coast artillery. His last assignment was supreme
commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, from which he
retired in 1969. In 1987, President Reagan awarded him the Medal of
Freedom.
   At Lemnitzer's retirement, President Nixon awarded him the
Distinguished Service Medals of the Army, Navy and Air Force. He
received military decorations from 15 countries.
   Lemnitzer was a studious, even-tempered officer with a reputation
as a ``brain'' whose dignity hid athletic skill that saw him pitch
for the Army War College team in 1940 and win marksmanship awards
for the Coast Artillery Rifle Team as a young officer.
   His wife, Katherine, once said he took papers into his study
every evening and commented, ``I don't know whether he goes in there
to work, or read or snooze.''
   Army Secretary John O. Marsh said, ``He will be remembered as a
patriot, a valiant combat leader and a wise and capable statesman.
... His passing will be mourned by not only Americans, but by the
champions of democracy throughout the world.''
   Gen. Carl E. Vuono, Army chief of staff, said Lemnitzer's life
``stands as eloquent testimony to the enduring value of a lifetime
of service to country.''
   Lemnitzer is survived by his widow, Katherine Mead Tryon
Lemnitzer, a daughter and a son. No cause of death was given in the
Army's announcement of Lemnitzer's passing.
   He will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery on Tuesday
following a funeral mass at the Old Post Chapel of Fort Myer, near
the Pentagon.
   Lyman Louis Lemnitzer, attached to the War Plans Division of Army
Headquarters, helped plan the allied invasion of French North Africa
in November 1942 and served on the staff of Gen. Dwight Eisenhower,
the commander of the invasion.
   He accompanied Gen. Mark Clark on a dramatic mission by submarine
to visit French officials three weeks before the invasion.
   Later, he negotiated with Marshal Pietro Badoglio for the
surrender of Italy in 1943, and with SS Gen. Karl Wolff in
Switzerland for the surrender of German forces in northern Italy and
southern Austria a few days before the final capitulation of Germany
in May 1945.
   For much of World War II, he was chief of staff to British Field
Marshal Sir Harold Alexander, supreme commander in the Mediterranean.
   Lemnitzer helped plan the beginnings of NATO in the late 1940s,
and helped persuade the Senate to ratify the NATO treaty. Assigned
to command the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., in
1950, he quietly took the basic airborne course to qualify as a
parachutist.
   He commanded the Seventh Infantry Division in the battles of
Heartbreak Ridge, the Punch Bowl and Chorwon Valley in the Korean
War, and was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry. After the war he
served as commander of United Nations Forces in Korea before
becoming Army chief of staff in 1959, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
in 1960 and NATO commander in 1962.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Ann-Margret returned to the stage
this week after a five-year hiatus from the city where she launched
her professional career as a teen-ager.
   During that time, she has appeared in four movies and three
television specials, establishing herself as a serious dramatic
actress.
   But sold-out performances at Caesars Palace are testimony the
singer and dancer has not missed a beat in the time she's been gone.
   Ann-Margret's show opens with a montage of photos, from baby
pictures to magazine covers, then shifts to movies and video of her
``sex kitten'' years.
   It then moves into a series of vigorous dance routines, for which
the 47-year-old entertainer spent months getting in shape.
   She told a standing-room-only crowd Friday night that she missed
performing on stage and finally decided to take the advice of her
long-time friend and mentor, George Burns, to return to the
footlights.
   Burns discovered Ann-Margret when she was appearing with a lounge
act in Las Vegas.
   After early movies including ``Bye, Bye, Birdie,'' ``Carnal
Knowledge'' and a number of films with the late Elvis Presley, she
developed a cabaret show with husband Roger Smith that set the
standard for Las Vegas production shows.
   She will appear at Caesars Palace through Nov. 21, and will
appear at Caesars resorts in Atlantic City, N.J., and Lake Tahoe,
Nev., as part of a two-year contract with Caesars World Inc.

   Thousands of Israelis demonstrated Saturday for
reforms in the electoral system that enabled 15 parties to gain
seats in Parliament but gave none enough power to form a government.
   The fragmented results of the Nov. 1 elections have forced Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to make concessions to religious parties in
return for their joining a coalition with his rightist Likud bloc.
   Both Likud and its rival, the center-left Labor Party, need the
support of the religious parties to form a majority in the
120-member parliament.
   Under heavy rains, some 15,000 protesters gathered in Malchei
Israel square in Tel Aviv, carrying posters calling for Likud and
Labor to form a temporary coalition for the sole purpose of passing
an electoral reform bill.
   The demonstrators carried blue-and-white Israeli flags, and some
wore buttons that said, ``I am secular and I am scared.'' The slogan
referred to potential religious rulings that the small Orthodox
parties could force on the Likud government if they become coalition
partners.
   The protesters hope new elections can be held as soon as a new
electoral system is in place.
   Under the proposed reform bill, voters would select a candidate
for prime minister rather than vote for a party. The majority of the
members of Parliament would be elected in regional elections.
   ``I am sure the message coming from all these thousands of people
will have an effect,'' said Uriel Reichman, a Tel Aviv University
law professor who heads the Committee For A Constitution in Israel,
which sponsored the rally.
   Under the present electoral system, the head of the party winning
the most Parliament seats becomes prime minister, provided he is
able to form a coalition.
   Likud won 40 seats in the Nov. 1 elections and Labor 39.
   Shamir made a major concession to the religious parties Friday
when he promised an amendment to the ``Who-is-a-Jew'' law, which
defines who is Jewish and thus eligible for automatic Israeli
citizenship.
   The Orthodox, who gained 18 seats altogether in the elections,
want the law amended so that only Orthodox rabbis would be able to
convert non-Jews to Judaism. Those converted by non-Orthodox rabbis

   A $166 million lawsuit charges that
four Yonkers city council members damaged the city's image and
financial stability by defying a federal desegregation order that
led to huge fines against the city.
   The class-action lawsuit by 16 residents alleged that the four
wasted taxpayers' money in violation of their oaths of office and
state laws governing official conduct.
   Plans for the suit were announced in August, shortly after the
four voted against endorsing a court-ordered plan to build low- and
moderate-income housing in the state's fourth-largest city. Lawyers
said Friday they filed the suit earlier in the week.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who had found the city liable
for 40 years of segregated housing and schools, had warned the
council that failure to support the plan would lead to a finding of
contempt.
   Vice Mayor Henry Spallone, one of the four council members, said
he might countersue.
   ``It's something in America, to have somebody sue you to make you
vote a certain way,'' he said. ``They're taking a page right out of
Adolf Hitler's book.''
   The lawsuit seeks $40 million each from the four council members
and $6 million jointly to pay for the contempt-of-court fine imposed
because of their votes and the alleged damages suffered by Yonkers,
officials said Friday.
   The lawsuit also demands the removal or suspension of the four:
Spallone, Minority Leader Nicholas Longo, Peter Chema and Edward
Fagan.
   Sand found the four councilmen, as well as Yonkers, in contempt
on Aug. 2, and imposed fines against the city and against the four
personally. The fine against the city was to escalate daily from
$100; a federal appeals court capped it at $1 million.
   In the face of widespread city layoffs, Chema and Longo changed
their positions the day the fine would have hit $1 million.
   ``The damages sustained by the city of Yonkers ... during the
period of contempt were horrendous,'' the lawsuit said. The
``willful misconduct'' of the four ``amounts to gross negligence and
dereliction of duty, waste and illegal conduct.''
   Yonkers paid a total of $819,000. Each of the four council
members paid $43,500 in personal fines; they plan to go to the U.S.
Supreme Court to challenge Sand's power to hold them in contempt
personally.
   The damages sought by the lawsuit represent fines and fees for
the time spent by lawyers dealing with the contempt issue, as well
as damage to the city's ability to raise money by selling municipal
bonds, its reputation, property values and tax rate.
   The lawsuit also seeks to bar City Manager Neil DeLuca and the
Emergency Financial Control Board, the city's fiscal watchdog, from
approving payments to lawyers representing the four councilmembers
in their personal contempt cases.

   Two East Germans climbed border
fences and escaped to West Germany early Saturday after their plan
to ram a truck through frontier barriers failed, police reported.
   They said three men were involved in the escape effort but one
was caught by East German border guards.
   Police said no shots were fired duing the incident and they gave
this account:
   At about 3 a.m. the three men tried to drive a truck through
barriers but the vehicle became stuck in deep ruts designed to block
such efforts.
   The men ran to a metal fence beyond the ruts and began climbing
with two, identified only as a 26-year-old metalworker and a
23-year-old mechanic, escaping. No information was given about the
man captured by the East German guards.
   A West German police spokesman in Hanover said the escape
occurred near the West German town of Goettingen, 110 miles
northeast of Frankfurt.

<TEXT>
   West Germany's top Jewish leader said
Saturday he and other members of the Jewish community will hold a
special meeting to deal with the bitter discord following a
controversial speech on the Nazi era.
   Heinz Galinski, chairman of the German Central Council of Jews,
said the council's directorate would meet Wednesday to discuss the
furor surrounding the speech by Philipp Jenninger, the president of
Parliament, who resigned Friday.
   Jenninger on Thursday delivered a parliamentary speech marking
the 50th anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom on Nov. 9-10, 1938,
a night of Nazi terror against Jews across Germany.
   In his address, Jenninger attempted to set the scene in the 1930s
when Adolf Hitler came to power, saying Germans initially found the
Nazi era ``glorious.''
   His remarks touched off anger in West Germany and abroad, with
critics saying he had shown no remorse over the Nazi era.
   Jenninger defended himself by saying he was misunderstood.
   The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper said Saturday
that no one could accuse Jenninger of being a Nazi sympathizer, and
noted his strong support for Israel. But the paper implied in a
commentary that some conservative Germans have difficulties putting
the Nazi era in perspective.
   ``He (Jenninger) did what has become fashionable among some
conservatives in this republic: Without consideration for possible
misunderstandings, they try desperately to put into perspective
Germany's 12-year departure from the civilized world in such a way
that the (Nazi) times may be explainable but their uniqueness is
lost,'' the newspaper said.
   Also criticized in some quarters was Michael Fuerst, deputy
chairman of the Jewish council, who defended Jenninger's address in
a television interview.
   ``I welcome that the Parliament president described in full
clarity what was happening in Germany between 1933 and 1938 ...
especially the fact that everything that Hitler did was strongly
supported by the masses of all Germans,'' Fuerst said in the
interview.
   Galinski said Fuerst's remarks angered many Jews.
   ``He has severely outraged the (Jewish) community in the Federal
Republic (West Germany), and also in Israel,'' Galinski told The
Associated Press Saturday.
   Galinski and Fuerst were already in a feud over Fuerst's
opposition earlier this month to Galinski's wishes to address
Parliament during the Kristallnacht observances.
   AP attempted to reach Fuerst at his office in Hanover on Saturday
telephone calls were not answered.
   A move by the leftist Greens party to invite Galinski to speak at
the observances in Parlilament was rejected on procedural grounds.
   Galinski reiterated on Saturday his criticism of Jenninger's
speech.
   ``The whole address was a big mistake. The second-ranking
official in our country has a certain responsibility,'' Galinski
said. ``This speech was given on the wrong day and at the wrong
place.''

   Torrential rains again pounded most of
Spain's Mediterranean coast Saturday, leaving three people dead,
flooding roads and knocking out electricity and telephone services,
police said.
   Firemen evacuated people from their homes in Viladecans southwest
of Barcelona and 17 families from Sant Adrian del Besos, also south
of Barcelona.
   Police advised residents of Badalona north of Barcelona and in
the Llobregat area to the south to remain in their houses to avoid
being carried away by flash floods.
   Floods sent water rushing through Areyns de Mar, north of
Barcelona, blocking roads with mud and damaging more than 100 cars,
police said.
   Early Saturday, rains lashed the east coast of Valencia province,
causing rivers to overflow their banks and damaging numerous cars
and buildings.
   Police found the bodies of a 30-year-old woman and her two young
daughters who had been reported missing late Friday after the
rushing waters of the Turia River swept their car off a road near
Liria, 25 miles from Valencia.
   The bodies had been carried several hundred yards from where the
car was found. The driver, the woman's husband, was unhurt, police
said.
   On Spain's southern Costa del Sol, heavy rainfall in Malaga
province knocked out electric power and telephone lines Friday.

<TEXT>
   First lady Nancy Reagan says she has had to
protect her husband against bad advice from White House aides
pushing their own agendas, but she doesn't see herself overstepping
any boundaries.
   In a wide-ranging interview published in Sunday editions of the
Los Angeles Times, Mrs. Reagan also discussed such issues as her
frosty relations with Raisa Gorbachev, wife of the Soviet leader,
and her estrangement from her daughter, Patti Davis.
   Mrs. Reagan said she felt ``hurt, surprised and disappointed'' by
some actions of President Reagan's staff members and acknowledged
without apology that she wielded influence over her husband on some
personnel decisions.
   ``I'm more aware if somebody is trying to end-run him and have
their own agenda,'' she said. ``I'm more aware of that than he is.
It just never occurs to him that anybody is going to do that.''
   A prime example, she said, was the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``He did not know what was going on and that's not right,'' Mrs.
Reagan said.
   She was especially angry at former chief of staff Donald T.
Regan, who in his book revealed Mrs. Reagan's interest in astrology
and portrayed her as an interfering tyrant.
   The first lady said that when Reagan underwent colon cancer
surgery, Regan wanted him to get up and attend a news conference in
two weeks, a request Mrs. Reagan said she turned down. She said
Regan saw her as meddling.
   ``But a first lady is a wife, first of all,'' she said. ``I don't
care. That comes first for me. I'm sure with everybody that comes
first. And I certainly felt that for Ronnie's interest _ it was to
his interest.''
   Mrs. Reagan declined to elaborate further on her relationship
with Regan or her interest in astrology, two matters she planned to
discuss in her upcoming autobiography.
   As to her relationship with Mrs. Gorbachev, the first lady said
that cultural differences may have contributed to the testiness of
their brief meetings and that ``by our standards'' Mrs. Gorbachev
could be considered rude.
   ``Now, by her standards, it may not be,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
   ``It's just coming from two completely different cultures and
trying to get together for the first time and maybe one not
understanding how the other works,'' she added. ``I think there was
way too much attention paid about that whole thing.''
   Mrs. Reagan became tearful when discussing her estrangement from
her daughter, and said the two haven't spoken in more than a year.
   She said she hoped the estrangement would not be permanent.
   ``I mean, I'm her mother,'' she said, her eyes filling with
tears. ``I hope not.''

<TEXT>
   An animal rights activist accused of
planting a pipe bomb that police said could have killed an executive
whose company uses dogs in medical experiments ``meant no harm,''
her father said Saturday.
   Neighbors of Fran Stephanie Trutt, 33, of New York City described
her as strange and said she often talked with animals.
   ``Of course she's innocent, she meant no harm,'' said Harry
Trutt, the woman's father, when contacted Saturday at his home in
New Hyde Park.
   He refused further comment, except to say his daughter hoped to
select an attorney by Tuesday.
   Her next-door neighbor, New York state Assemblyman Ivan
Lafayette, said, ``She was a sort of strange person. If you had to
draw a profile of someone who wasn't quite right, she'd be it.''
   Norwalk police arrested Ms. Trutt just after midnight Friday and
planned to hold her through the weekend under $500,000 bond pending
arraignment in Superior Court Monday on charges of attempted murder,
possession of explosives and manufacturing a bomb.
   Ms. Trutt is accused of planting a powerful, radio-controlled
bomb in bushes at the Norwalk headquarters of U.S. Surgical Corp.,
near the parking space of company chairman Leon Hirsch. The bomb was
wrapped with roofing nails, which would have acted as projectiles.
   About 200 people were working in the plant overnight at the time
of the incident.
   A search of the woman's basement apartment turned up three more
homemade bombs fashioned from standard plumbing pipes, said New York
City police Deputy Inspector Vincent Tarone.
   Police said the bombs were made of large firecrackers, called
M-80s, wrapped with nails and BB pellets and stuffed into pipes.
   The devices ``certainly would have destroyed the entire
building'' and damaged surrounding houses, Tarone said.
   Several hundred residents near Ms. Trutt's home in Queens were
evacuated for several hours Friday afternoon while police searched
the apartment.
   Police also found a sawed-off shotgun, a homemade weapon
described as a cross between a bazooka and a shotgun, and pictures
of animal torture in her apartment.
   Ms. Trutt also rents a garage in New York City where police found
several emaciated dogs she apparently was trying to nurse back to
health.
   New York City police spokesman, Sgt. Norris Hollomon, said Ms.
Trutt would face charges of criminal possession of a dangerous
weapon and possibly other charges.
   The FBI also was investigating the incident ``as a possible
terrorist act and for several federal violations,'' police said.
   A neighbor, Rebecca Rollins, said Ms. Trutt ``told one neighbor
that she only speaks to dogs. She looked like a leftover hippie from
the '60s,'' the Daily News reported.
   Maria Alvarado, who lives down the block, told New York Newsday:
``She used to always talk to my dog when I walked him, but not to
me. She'd say weird things to the dog, like ask him questions and
wait for an answer.''
   Police staked out the company, which produces surgical stapling
devices, after receiving information that it might be the target of
violence, Norwalk police Lt. Jeff Finch said.
   Ms. Trutt was carrying a radio-controlled detonator for the bomb
when she was arrested, Finch said.
   U.S. Surgical conducts experiments on about 1,000 animals, mostly
dogs, a year, Hirsch said. The animals, which are obtained from U.S.
Department of Agriculture farms, are destroyed after experiments are
completed, he said.

   A federal prosecutor finished his closing
arguments Saturday in the racketeering trial of reputed mob boss
Nicodemo Scarfo and 16 associates.
   ``The cloak of innocence has been removed,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Louis Pichini. ``The evidence has stripped that cloak and
established beyond reasonable doubt that these defendants are
guilty.''
   The FBI says Scarfo, 59, of Atlantic City is the head of the mob
in the Philadelphia and southern New Jersey area. He is accused with
the other 16 men of participating in a racketeering conspiracy that
included nine murders, four attempted murders, extortions, drug
dealing, loansharking and illegal gambling.
   ``The Mafia system says that might is right, and violence will
prevail,'' Pichini said. ``This is not the American justice way. The
government has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the U.S.
system of law will not bow to intimidation. Might is not right.
   ``As a juror, you must show strength, independence, and courage,
and set aside bias and fear,'' Pichini said. ``For the American
system of justice to work, there is only one verdict for you to
return and only one word.''
   ``Guilty.''
   Oscar Goodman of Las Vegas, the first of the 17 defense attorneys
to give a closing argument, attacked the credibility of the
government's main witnesses, Thomas DelGiorno and Nicholas
Caramandi, ex-gangsters turned government informants.
   ``Those guys told fairy tales. It's not worthy of belief,''
Goodman said.
   During the prosecution summation Scarfo sat beside his attorney,
showing little emotion as he listened to Pichini describe him as ``a
cold-blooded paranoid killer (who led) a band of urban outlaws (and)
settled disputes by bloodletting, violence and intimidation.''
   Goodman asked the jurors not to make up their minds until they
hear from the remaining 16 defense lawyers who will present closing
arguments next week.
   Judge Franklin VanAntwerpen adjourned the court until Monday
morning.

   Children at risk of failing in school should
be helped at the preschool level, a group of educators said Saturday.
   The Council of Chief State School Officers, which is meeting
through Monday, said states must reach disadvantaged children
earlier and increase parents' involvement with their preschool
children.
   ``The council believes the single most important investment to be
made in education is the provision of high-quality programs for the
nation's youngest children who are most at risk and for their
families,'' the statement said.
   Good early-childhood programs are linked to success in school,
the council said. Pre-kindergarten programs should begin at age 3,
the statement said.

   Athletes were huffing and puffing on weight
machines Saturday, lifting legs, pumping pectorals and building
biceps _ all with the never-failing encouragement of an electronic
coach.
   ``I really like your effort, hang in there,'' says Harry. ``Two
more _ control your breathing.''
   ``Harry'' is part of Powercise, a new system on display this
weekend at Club Industry '88, a trade show of the latest machines,
gadgets, computer programs, health foods and clothing designed to
keep people coming back to health clubs when their interest in
exercise is waning.
   Between seminars with titles such as ``The Future of
Racquetsports'' and ``Why People Join,'' more than 3,000 health club
proprietors and purveyors of fitness equipment milled among the
products Saturday, trying out the stationary cycles, the headsets
for aerobics instructors and the relaxation machines.
   ``This is like having your own personal coach,'' says Celia
Merryman, who sells Powercise for Houston-based LivingWell Inc.
``They really do have their own personalities _ Pierre over here on
the Pec Deck is French, so he has a little accent.''
   The theory behind the talking exercise machines, she says, is to
push people who might not otherwise go into a health club _ or who
might not continue to work out after they join.
   ``We're not interested in the bodybuilders, we're interested in
the masses,'' Ms. Merryman says.
   But if the intent of the machinery is to take inches off your
stomach and thighs, most of the products displayed would also take
inches off your wallet.
   Powercise, for example, goes for $60,000. A similarly equipped
system by Universal, with no electronic coach, will set you back
$80,000.
   And for only $690, Les Organ of Florida-based Naparima Inc. sells
a body composition analysis meter and IBM-compatible software
program that he says will tell health club patrons what percent of
their weight is fat _ which can be used to show them the progress
they have made after dieting and exercise.
   ``The way to keep people interested and keep them coming back to
the health club is to show them progress,'' Organ said.
   At the Telecycle display, Ed Kemon of Middleburg, Va. hawks a
$2,495 stationary cycle with a videotape that makes you think you're
riding behind a group of riders in races such as the Tour de France.
   ``What our business is is providing entertainment and
motivation,'' Kemon says. ``What we're trying to do is involve
people in this travel.''
   Further down the aisle, four customers sit in shiny white,
egg-shaped chairs, listening to an '80s version of the Dale Carnegie
course and watching waves, flowers and birds on a large television
screen.
   ``Feel the nurturing energy of the midday sun,'' a deep voice
croons, waves crashing and soft music playing in the background.
``Let the colors and sounds take you back to a personal memory. ...
Travel deeper into your center.''
   After five minutes in an Alpha Chamber, sold by Sensory
Environment Engineers of Fontana, Calif., for $13,800 per chair with
a TV, video recorder and 50 tapes, most adults ``access 80 percent
of their potential for relaxation,'' said company spokeswoman
Velinka Udicki.
   She says the chairs are being tried out at the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point, N.Y., and at the Olympic Training Center in
Colorado Springs, Colo., and that the company has already sold
thousands to health clubs, spas and even corporations looking for
quick and easy relaxation for stressed-out executives.
   ``The 80s are definitely a time of physical fitness,'' Ms. Udicki
says. ``But the 90s are going to be a time of balance between mental
and physical fitness.''

   The 10-member Soviet group, including three Moscow chefs and four
folk musicians, began a 10-day, eight-city tour of the United States
Tuesday in Washington, D.C.
   ``I hope that at some future date, we will be able to look back
and say this was the beginning of a deeper friendship between the
Russian and American people through their food,'' Prudhomme said
during the gathering at a French Quarter hotel.
   The Soviet group later visited a Schweggmann's supermarket _ a
New Orleans institution that sells everything from groceries and
fresh seafood to sporting goods and small appliances.
   Earlier in the day, the group toured the Louisiana Superdome.
   The agenda also included a Saturday night feast on the Creole
Queen, a Mississippi River paddlewheeler.

   The government newspaper on Saturday
accused the opposition daily of trying to block international aid
for damage inflicted by Hurricane Joan by saying the government is
lying about the extent of the damage.
   The opposition paper, La Prensa, charged Friday that the
government was planning to use the aid for the military, not to help
the thousands left homeless when Joan struck Nicaragua last month.
   La Prensa also accused the Sandinistas of ``demanding'' aid from
the diplomatic community and said they had ``asked for too much''
and ``in a bad way.''
   Barricada, the official paper of the ruling Sandinista party,
said Saturday in an editorial that the damage from the hurricane was
even worse than first thought.
   The newspaper linked La Prensa's charges to the United States,
which has been backing anti-Sandinista rebels since 1982. It said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also had been casting doubt
on the actual destination of international aid.
   ``Almost simultaneously, La Prensa and the (Nicaraguan political
parties on) the right began their campaign of lies and insults,
aimed at politicizing the hurricane and blocking international
aid,'' Barricada said.
   Barricada said there would not be a replay of a 1972 scandal
surrounding foreign aid to help Nicaragua recover from a devasting
earthquake that caused extensive damage to the capital. The
dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, who was overthrown by the
Sandinistas in 1979, siphoned off the aid and never rebuilt Managua.

   A Colombian man has become the first person
convicted of fraud in the immigration amnesty program, federal
officials said.
   John Jairo Alzate, 33, was described by U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials as a high-level member of a
Colombian gang that had drug and organized crime connections. He was
found guilty Thursday in a Houston federal court on two counts of
legalization fraud for lying on his amnesty application, two counts
of illegal possession of a firearm and one charge of re-entering the
country after being deported.
   He had denied on his application that he had a felony conviction
or had ever been deported, when he not only had been deported but
had a lengthy felony conviction record, the INS said.
   Alzate will be sentenced Jan. 9, said INS spokeswoman Lisa Jacobs.

<HEAD>CIA Deputy Director Anticipates Little Change In Agency's Function</HEAD>

   President-elect George Bush will bring the
intelligence community's ``unique perspective'' with him to the
White House, but that knowledge will have little effect on the
functions of the CIA, the agency's deputy director said Saturday.
   ``Obviously, it is a unique circumstance. We have never had a
president who has served as head of the CIA before,'' Robert M.
Gates said. ``He brings a knowledge ... perspective no other
president has.''
   Gates was interviewed by reporters here during a visit along with
Sen. David Boren, D-Okla. Boren, chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, was being inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame by the
Oklahoma Heritage Association.
   Gates said the president-elect's familiarity with the agency's
operation may make him more ``demanding'' of the CIA.
   Gates said, however, that he does not expect the CIA to take a
more active or visible role in the intelligence community while Bush
is in office.
   ``First of all, the CIA is not a policy-making agency,'' Gates
said. ``We are there primarily to collect information, analyze it,
evaluate it and provide it to the president and his senior policy
officials to help inform their decisions.''
   ``We do not make that policy. We do not recommend policy and
certainly there will be no changes in that.''
   Gates, a 22-year veteran of the CIA who was appointed deputy
director by President Reagan, said he does not know if he will be
re-appointed, but probably would leave the agency if new leadership
were brought in.
   The White House has asked for resignations from all political
appointees so that Bush can ``put his own stamp on things.'' The
transition team has not indicated whether Bush intends to replace
CIA Director William Webster, a former FBI chief appointed to head
the agency after William Casey died in May 1987.
   ``It is very important that the president have a director of
central intelligence that he is comfortable with and I think Judge
Webster has done a fine job,'' Gates said. ``And as I said before,
we all serve at the pleasure of the president.''
   Gates also said he does not expect the Soviet Union to treat Bush
any different than other presidents because of his CIA background.
   ``They have had the opportunity to interact with him for a long
time and in a variety of different positions,'' Gates said. ``I
don't think it will have any impact.''

<HEAD>Nation's First Woman Episcopal Bishop Rejected By Dallas Diocese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first female Episcopal bishop has been
denied affirmation of ordination by the Standing Committee of the
Episcopal Diocese of Dallas, church officials said.
   The Rev. C.V. Westapher, parish priest of the Church of the
Incarnation and president of the committee, said Friday that the
vote was 3-2 on Tuesday, with one abstention, against the proposed
consecration of the Rev. Barbara Harris, a priest from Philadelphia.
   The Rev. Harris, 58, was elected last month by the Diocese of
Massachusetts in September as suffragan, or assistant bishop of
Massachusetts.
   Before she can be consecrated, however, her election must be
approved by a majority of the 118 diocesan bishops and their
standing committees. The failure of either group to give majority
consent voids the election.
   Westapher said he could not predict how other standing committees
in the church would vote. No election in anyone's memory has been
overturned, he said.
   The Rev. Harris' consecration has been set for early February.
   From the outset, her election was controversial among
traditionalists who oppose the ordination or consecration of women
as priests and bishops. All but a handful of dioceses, however, have
ordained women as priests.
   The Dallas committee is made up of three clergy and three laity
members. Westapher, noting that the church has many black bishops,
said race was never an issue in the committee's discussion. The Rev.
Harris is black.
   Because he is the only conservative on the committee, Westapher
said, he was the only one who raised the issue of her being a woman
as a barrier to elevation. One member found her divorce a problem,
he said.
   The committee based its judgment on what members considered the
Rev. Harris' lack of qualifications. He said politics was involved
in electing her over others who he said were ``much better
qualified.''
   ``Don't misunderstand us,'' he said. ``She is brilliant. But she
never went to college or had structured seminary training. That is
part of the discipline of preparation for the ministry _ whether it
be for a deacon, priest or the episcopacy.''
   Last month, bishops of six of the 99 dioceses of the Episcopal
Church denounced her election as the first female bishop in the
world-wide Anglican communion.
   The Episcopal Church is one of 28 national branches of that
communion.
   Declaring that the Anglican faith would be ``irrreparably
compromised'' if Harris were consecrated a bishop, the six bishops
said they ``cannot accept the validity of ordinations or
confirmations she administers.''

   A bomb exploded early Sunday in a bar in

police reported.
   They said no foreigners were in the Krach Bar in the Nea Smyrni
suburb when the bomb went off at about 3 a.m.
   Police identified the slain woman as Xanthi Stamataki, a
20-year-old university student. They said the three injured victis
were in serious but stable condition at the Athens General Hospital.
   A police spokesman said there were about 10 people in the bar
when the bomb exploded. No individual or group has asserted
responsibility for the attack, he added.

   A supermarket cashier was suspended for
speaking Spanish to fellow employees, prompting Hispanic activists
to picket the store.
   Police on Friday also investigated one of numerous bomb threats
made following the action Publix Super Markets took against Alberto
Warwar, 30.
   Warwar said store manager Larry Dollar suspended him for 10 days
after overhearing Warwar ask a question in Spanish to two other
cashiers Thursday.
   Warwar was disciplined under a store policy that prohibits
personal conversation between employees during work hours, a Publix
official said.
   Warwar, who has worked at the Publix for 2{ months, said the
written reprimand indicated he was suspended without pay for
``speaking a foreign language.''
   Bill Fauerbach, Publix district manager for the South Miami-Coral
Gables area, said the reprimand was written ``hastily ... and not
complete.''
   ``We couldn't care less whether they were talking in Japanese or
Greek or whatever,'' added Bill Schroter, vice president for
corporate communications at the company's Lakeland headquarters.
``The point is that they were engaging in a personal conversation
when they should not have been.''
   On Friday, a group of Hispanics picketed outside the store urging
Spanish speakers to shop elsewhere.
   Coral Gables police found all the bomb threats to be false
alarms, and nobody was evacuated.
   Publix officials said Warwar could return to work, but he said he
didn't want the job back.

   The bodies of four elderly people were
unearthed near a boardinghouse, one wrapped ``like a mummy'' in a
table cloth, and police said the victims' Social Security checks had
been stolen and cashed regularly.
   Police were looking for the manager of the boarding home, Dorthea
Montalvo Puente, late Saturday, said police Lt. Joe Enloe. He said
Montalvo, 71, was not prevented from walking away from the well-kept
Victorian house earlier in the day, but police later decided they
had sufficient evidence to arrest her for investigation of homicide.
   ``We do not believe she acted alone,'' Enloe said. ``Someone else
probably had knowledge of what was going on.'' He did not elaborate,
except to say that robbery was believed to be the motive.
   Police said victims' Social Security checks were cashed
apparently after their deaths.
   Montalvo was convicted in 1982 of grand theft in a case stemming
from charges she drugged three elderly people and took their
possessions after meeting them in bars, police said.
   The remains of an elderly woman wrapped ``like a mummy, all the
way up and around her head'' were discovered Friday when police
received a tip there was a body buried in the yard, Enloe said.
   The other bodies were discovered Saturday, one in a plastic bag,
and digging was expected to continue for several more days, police
said.
   Police did not release the victims' names, but said the elderly
woman may have been buried since April. The victims did not meet
violent deaths, Enloe said.
   Police went to the house on Monday after neighbors reported that
former tenant Bert Montoya had been missing since August.
   There were eight rooms for tenants in the house, and at least
three people were living there this week, police said.
   The bodies were found in the back yard and along both sides of
the house. Several recently planted trees had to be removed and a
gazebo in the back yard torn down to uncover the graves, said Enloe.

   Emperor Hirohito had a mild fever Sunday morning but
was otherwise stable, palace officials reported.
   ``There has been no change in his condition,'' Imperial Household
Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda told a news conference. He said the
emperor's temperature was 99.8 Sunday morning and his normal
temperature is about 95.9.
   Maeda also said the monarch's blood pressure had returned to 114
over 50 after high readings Saturday caused concern that further
blood loss was imminent. Hirohito's blood pressure reached 146
Saturday evening.
   Hirohito, 87, has bled intermittently from the upper intestinal
region and palace physicians have attributed his fever to
inflammation in that area. He has been under intensive medical care
for more than seven weeks.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny reports that the
emperor has cancer.
   The monarch's most recent discharge of blood was reported last
Tuesday. Since the onset of his crisis Sept. 19, Hirohito has
received 41 pints of blood in almost daily transfusions.

<TEXT>
   Vet Boswell, the last surviving member of
the popular and influential 1930s singing trio the Boswell Sisters,
died Saturday. She was 77.
   Miss Boswell died in Peekskill Community Hospital, where she had
been admitted with pneumonia, according to her daughter, Chica
Minnerly.
   Helvetia Boswell _ known by her nickname Vet _ and her sisters
Martha and Connee were born and raised in New Orleans.
   They gained fame in the late '20s and early '30s for harmonies
and arrangements that filtered jazz and blues into a distinctive
style that was a precursor of swing music and influenced such
performers as Ella Fitzgerald, the Mills Brothers and the Andrews
Sisters.
   ``It was a new sound in its time, jazz violins and small bands
just before the big bands came in,'' said Spencer A. Tandy, who
produced a 1980 musical about the sisters called ``The Heebie
Jeebies,'' the title of one of their hits.
   Among the trio's popular songs were ``Dinah,'' ``Yessir, That's
My Baby,'' ``The Music Goes Round and Round'' and ``Top Hat.'' They
appeared in three feature films and several shorts.
   ``Martha kept the books, Connee played the horses and I was in
charge of the house and bought all the clothes,'' Miss Boswell
recalled in a 1981 interview.
   She retired from performing when the trio broke up. Martha died
in 1958 and Connee, who had a successful solo career, died in 1976.
   Vet Boswell is survived by her daughter, three grandchildren and
five great-grandchildren. A wake will be held Monday in Peekskill,
where Miss Boswell lived and where a funeral service is scheduled
for Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested about 200 anti-abortion protesters nationwide
Saturday as they tried to prevent women from entering clinics, while
demonstrations were held in New York and Washington to support a
woman's right to undergo the procedure.
   The anti-abortion protests were held in Indianapolis, Milwaukee
and the Detroit suburb of Livonia. The ``pro-choice'' demonstrations
were in Buffalo and a Seattle suburb, where 22 people were arrested.
   The Seattle demonstrations involved both sides when pro-choice
activists prevented anti-abortion activists from leaving a church by
putting a metal gate across the exit. The anti-abortion activists
later were freed to go to their own demonstration, where 56 of them
were arrested.
   The protests were peaceful, although one of the 15 people
arrested in Indianapolis was charged with disorderly conduct for
allegedly blocking a police van. Sixty-five people were arrested in
Milwaukee.
   The anti-abortion demonstrators were supporters of Operation
Rescue, which held protests in about two dozen cities Oct. 30. Those
protests were linked to a continuing abortion protest in Atlanta
that began when the Democratic National Convention was held there in
July and has resulted in 1,200 arrests.
   In Milwaukee, police said it took about two-and-a-half hours to
remove demonstrators from the downtown office building housing
Affiliated Medical services.
   Some demonstrators sat wall-to-wall on the floor of the eighth
floor hallway, singing hymns and praying. When people tried to pass,
the protesters rose to their knees and locked arms. Others marched
and sang in the rain outside the building.
   The medical director of the clinic is Dr. Benjamin M. Victoria
Jr., whose house in Brookfield, Wis., had been the subject of
frequent protest marches before such picketing in the residential
area was outlawed.
   Officers in Indianapolis said they recognized some of the
protesters outside the Clinic for Women as people who had been
arrested in previous demonstrations there.
   The demonstrators carried signs and quoted Bible verses to people
at the clinic.
   ``We're trying to keep these mothers away from the door,'' said
Don Ely, pastor of the Believers Fellowship Church in Bloomington,
Ind. ``We're trying to give them another minute or two minutes or a
half hour to decide not to murder their baby.''
   Women who needed to enter the clinic were assisted by volunteers
from the Indiana Pro Choice Action League, and clinic administrator
Jane Stout said no women were kept from entering the building.
   ``This only infringes on something that is so personal and so
private, which they (protesters) have no right to do,'' Stout said.
   In Livonia, Mich., 57 people were arrested outside the Women's
Advisory Center. No injuries or property damage were reported, Sgt.
Dennis Farmer said.
   All 57 were given tickets to appear later in court on charges of
disorderly conduct, punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $100
fine upon conviction, he said.
   About 150 pro-choice demonstrators picketed outside Buffalo
Police Department headquarters to protest police handling of recent
anti-abortion blockades at clinics.
   ``They are aiding and abetting law breakers,'' said Ruth Laws,
Buffalo chapter president of the National Organization for Women.
   The protesters said that Buffalo police have failed to arrest or
disband anti-abortion protesters who have blockaded abortion clinics
recently.
   At an anti-abortion blockade last month in Buffalo, police
arrested 81 protesters. The estimated 500 protesters were able to
keep the clinic from admitting patients for two days, however.
   ``We're saying to the city that we want equal enforcement,'' said
Marilynn Buckham, director of the clinic that was blockaded. ``We
have been treated like the criminals.''
   The demonstrators, who were watched closely but not interfered
with by police, chanted: ``Our bodies, our lives, our right to
decide,'' and ``Keep the clinics open, the law should not be
broken,'' as well as other slogans.

   Lightning killed a 13-year-old girl in Louisiana and a tornado
touched down in Vicksburg, Miss., as thunderstorms, damaging winds
and hail moved through the Gulf Coast region Saturday.
   The National Weather Service said a cold front stretching across
the Mississippi Valley was responsible.
   Ronda Weathersby died when lightning traveled down a tree in her
back yard in Tallulah and struck her, said Chief Deputy John Baker
of the Madison Parish Sheriff's Department.
   Winds were clocked at 60 mph in Jackson, Miss., and 52 mph in
Shreveport, La. High winds in other areas knocked out power lines
and downed trees.
   An inch of hail fell in Simmsboro, La.
   The weather service forecast partly cloudy skies by Sunday with
scattered showers.

   The Coast Guard suspended an air and sea search
Saturday for two Haitians missing after their boat was detained by
U.S. authorities and sank in the Windward passage between Haiti and
Cuba.
   The two Haitians had been aboard a 25-foot boat stopped by the
Coast Guard cutter Tampa on Friday evening, Coast Guard spokesman
Petty Officer 1st Class Jerry Snyder said.
   He said a four-man crew, including an agent of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, were conducting a routine
interdiction operation when the boat began to sink.
   According to Snyder, the boarding party had counted those aboard
the boat and while 12 Haitians were picked up by the Tampa, two
Haitians were unaccounted for.
   Snyder said the Tampa launched a second small boat as the vessel
sank, and a Coast Guard H-65 helicopter joined in the search, along
with another helicopter from the nearby Navy ship USS Blakely.
   The dozen Haitians rescued remained aboard the Tampa during the
search, which was suspended Saturday morning and was not expected to
resume, Snyder said.

   During World War II Lemnitzer helped plan the invasion of French
North Africa, served on the staff of Gen. Dwight Eisenhower and
helped negotiate the surrender of Italy in 1943, and of German
forces in northern Italy and southern Austria a few days before the
final capitulation of Germany in May 1945.
   Lemnitzer also helped plan NATO in the late 1940s. Assigned to
command the 11th Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., in 1950,
he quietly took the basic airborne course to qualify as a
parachutist.
   In the Korean War he commanded the Seventh Infantry Division and
was awarded the Silver Star. After the war he served as commander of
U.N. forces in Korea, becoming Army chief of staff in 1959, chairman

   More than 400 Palestinian leaders
gathered today for a meeting of the Palestine parliament-in-exile in
a session expected to result in the declaration of an independent
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A leading PLO official said the declaration would be an important
step toward establishing a Palestinian homeland in the
Israeli-occupied territories. The Israeli government, claiming the
move will only cause more violence, tightened security in the
territories.
   ``From the international, legal point of view, this (independence
declaration) will consecrate officially the identity of the West
Bank and Gaza,'' said Bassam Abu Sharif, chief spokesman for PLO
leader Yasser Arafat. Abu Sharif said the next step after
declaration is recognition of the Palestinian state from other

have to buy their tickets at least 14 days in advance and meet other
restrictions to obtain the lowest fare to some destinations.
   Continental Airlines took the first step Nov. 4 by eliminating
one-way discount fares, which require advance purchase. Other big
carriers, including American, Northwest and United, quickly followed
suit.

   President-elect George Bush's transition team
is moving into its new headquarters this weekend as aides devise
procedures for picking leaders of the next administration.
   Bush, meanwhile, vacationed in Gulf Stream, Fla., Friday where he
said little about his plans for the transition. He reiteratd there
would be no personnel announcements until after he returns to the
nation's capital Monday or Tuesday. Asked if he was compiling lists
of potential appointees, Bush said: ``No. No.''
   Robert Teeter, co-director of the transition with Craig Fuller,
chief of staff in the vice president's office, said the two men
planned to spend the weekend mulling over procedures for the
personnel selection process. They will confer early next week after
the transition office officially opens on Monday.

   A presidential ``stock market'' that required
participants to ``put their money where their mouth is'' accurately
predicted the outcome of the presidential election, the market's
originators say.
   The computerized market was established by four researchers at
the University of Iowa who wanted to see if it could outperform
opinion polls. In it, professors and students gambled cash to buy
shares of the candidates. After the election, share owners were paid
a dividend that depended on the fraction of the popular vote
received by each candidate. A trader could make money by accurately
predicting the outcome and then bidding to buy shares at prices
below his forecast or to sell at prices above it.
   ``In theory it's more accurate (than polls) because of the
financial incentive people have to put their money where their mouth
is,'' said one of the researchers, Robert Forsythe, an economist.

   Videotapes of a man accused of
killing his daughter show him assuming the voices of ``Satan,'' his
dead grandmother and some other of the 10 personalities that a
psychiatrist says he diagnosed.
   A jury that began watching the videotapes Friday saw a hypnotized
Thomas Lee Bonney tremble with grief and pound his fist on a table
as he insisted that his daughter, Kathy Carol Bonney, 19, was not
dead. Bonney is charged with shooting his daughter 27 times.
   In one videotape, Bonney said his daughter visits him in jail.

   In 68 days, Ronald Reagan will turn over the
White House to George Bush, but in reality the transfer of power
already is underway.
   The clock is quickly running out on Reagan's presidency, so
Congress, the federal bureaucracy and foreign governments are
searching for clues about what the next man will do.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher will be at the White House this week for farewell
meetings with Reagan. They also want to see Bush.
   Congress has quit for the year and won't be back until January,
foreclosing the possibility of any last-minute initiatives for
lawmakers from Reagan.

   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on Saturday
urged President-elect George Bush to change Washington's Middle East
policy, and he said Palestinians won't stop fighting until their
flag flies over Jerusalem.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization chief spoke at the opening
of the special session of the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile.
   The four-day meeting is expected to conclude with a declaration
of Palestinian independence for the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Support of Palestinians has increased during the 11-month Arab
uprising against Israel's occupation of the territories. More than
300 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died.

   Jewish fundamentalists have broken out
of their tight-knit neighborhoods and self-imposed isolation in a
quest for political power that has alarmed a largely secular Israel.
   In the early years of the Jewish state, members of the
ultra-Orthodox movements of Judaism concentrated on rebuilding
communities nearly wiped out by the Holocaust.
   The task has been largely accomplished, and many fundamentalists
have now become involved in politics.
   ``By participating in the political process, these parties are
modernizing. They are breaking out of the ghetto,'' said Shmuel
Sandler, professor at the religious Bar Ilan University near Tel
Aviv. ``They want a piece of the national pie.''

   Marching bands played, champagne corks
popped and residents gleefully speculated what they could get for
their property when they learned they'd be neighbors of the new
``super collider.''
   Energy Secretary James Herrington announced the selection
Thursday of Ellis County, south of Dallas, as the home for the $4.4
billion atom smasher, a 53-mile tunnel scientists hope will give an
unprecedented view of the basic structure of matter.
   Real estate agents Saturday warned that any property value
increases would be slow in coming.
   ``The thing that we have tried to do is be realistic with our
sellers,'' said Lucille Boardman, broker associate with Merrill
Lynch Realty in DeSoto, between Waxahachie and Dallas. ``We don't
see any getting rich quick.''

   The murder case against a disbarred lawyer
accused of beating his adopted daughter to death rests on
circumstantial evidence, which can be a stumbling block with jurors,
according to a legal expert.
   Prosecutors in the Joel Steinberg trial admit they have no
eyewitnesses or physical evidence linking him directly to 6-year-old
Lisa's death, so they must try to disprove every reasonable
possibility except the defendant's guilt.
   Richard Uviller, professor of criminal law at Columbia University
Law School, said the word ``circumstantial'' is perceived as
``dirty'' in the minds of many jurors. The prosecutor's first task
is to overcome this prejudice, he said.
   ``Circumstantial evidence should not necessarily be thought of as
inferior,'' Uviller said last week. ``It is no different than other
kinds of evidence.''

<HEAD>Wall Street Retreats After Bush Victory</HEAD>

   Wall Street wanted it, expected it and got it.
But when a George Bush victory finally arrived, there was no
celebration.
   Instead, investors sighed, then retreated.
   When all was said and done, the market acted more relieved that
Michael Dukakis did not win, than pleased that George Bush did.
   ``I don't think anyone really wanted Bush; he was the lesser of
two evils,'' asserted John Burnett, senior vice president at
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
   ``I don't know how to describe Wall Street's attitude,'' said
Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading for Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. ``You heard more `I'm glad Dukakis didn't win'
than `I'm glad Bush won.'''
   ``(The market's reaction) was relief that Dukakis did not win,''
added Michael Metz, vice president for Oppenheimer & Co.
   Analysts said investors felt little like celebrating as they
awoke to post-election reality and the same problems that had
troubled the market in the period leading up to the vote _ interest
rates, the dollar and the budget and trade deficits.
   With the election over, the most immediate question was whether
the Federal Reserve would move to raise interest rates.
   Next was how Bush would reduce the massive federal budget
deficit. Many analysts feared Bush had backed himself into a corner
by vowing not to raise taxes.
   Then there was the question of the deteriorating dollar and how
foreign investors would react. The currency got a downward shove
early in the week from Bush adviser and Harvard economist Martin
Feldstein, who suggested that a lower dollar would do more to extend
the economic recovery and help the U.S. trade deficit. The weak
dollar dragged down bonds and stocks.
   Added to those concerns was the newest question mark: Would Bush
be able to work with Congress to solve all those problems?
   And intruding on an already nervous market were fears that
Congress might move to put the brakes on leveraged buyouts. Those
concerns emerged when Republican Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
suggested at midweek that the deductibility of interest rates used
for buyouts be eliminated.
   With little to soothe their shattered confidence, investors fled
to the sidelines to sort out the prospects for the future.
   This post-election paralysis was reflected in a sharp decline in
trading activity. Volume on the Big Board averaged 138.62 million
shares a day, down from 150.50 million the week before.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials suffered its
worst one-day loss in nearly seven months, falling 47.66 points to
2,067.03. The last bigger loss was 101.46 points on April 14.
   The Dow industrial average's 78.77-point loss for the full week
was the biggest since Aug. 8-12, when the blue-chip indicator
dropped 81.61 points.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 4.46 over the
week to end at 151.24; the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market lost 7.26 to end the week at 373.76; and the
American Stock Exchange market value index was down 6.04 at 291.48.
   Analysts said the market's failure to respond to the Bush victory
was in itself a message to the president-elect.
   ``OK, George, what do you have up your sleeve? That's what people
want to know,'' Walsh said.
   For the near-term, analysts say investors need answers. They say
Bush needs to move quickly to eliminate the uncertainty that has
pervaded Wall Street in the aftermath of his victory.
   ``The way he conducts himself and what he says between now and
inauguration about how he's going to deal with the deficit and other
concerns will make a difference in the market,'' Burnett said.
   Until those and other questions are resolved, investors could
remain noncommittal.
   ``The market could stay in this trading range for a good amount
of time,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc.
