   And I think that most people know my position on the sanctity of
life. I favor adoption, I do not favor abortion.
   Lehrer: Question for the vice president, Anne.
   Groer: Mr. Vice President, I'd like to stay with abortion for
just a moment if I might. Over the years you have expressed several
positions, while opposing nearly all forms of government payment
for it. You now say that you support abortion only in cases of
rape, incest, or threat to a mother's life. And you also support a
constitutional amendment that, if ratified, would outlaw most
abortions. But, if abortions were to become illegal again, do you
think that the women who defy the law, and have them anyway, as
they did before it was OK'd by the Supreme Court, and the doctors
who performed them, should go to jail?
   Bush: I haven't sorted out the penalties, but I do know _ I do
know that I oppose abortion, and I favor adoption.
   And if we can get this law changed, where everybody should make
the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and
sometimes aborted, take the _ let them come to birth and then put
them in a family where they'll be loved.
   And, you see, yes, my position has evolved, and it's continuing
to evolve and it's evolving in favor of life.
   And I had a couple of exceptions that I support _ rape, incest,
and the life of the mother.
   Sometimes, people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this.
   But, it's much clearer for me now. As I've seen, abortion is
sometimes used as a birth control device, for heaven's sakes _ see
the millions of these killings accumulate.
   And this is one where you can have an honest difference of
opinion. We certainly do. But, no, I'm for the sanctity of life.
   And once that illegality is established, then we can come to
grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some
penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.
   Q. Governor?
   Dukakis: Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that
he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.
   It's as simple as that. I don't think it's enough to come before
the American people, who are watching us tonight and say, ``Well, I
haven't sorted it out.''
   This is a very, very difficult and a fundamental decision that
all of us has to make. And what he is saying, if I understand him
correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for
making this choice.
   Bush: I just _
   Dukakis: No. Let me finish.
   Bush: Yes, sure.
   Dukakis: Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman
and the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that
makes that decision.
   And I think that's the right approach, the right decision and I
would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue,
and come to terms with it as I have.
   I respect his right to disagree with me but I think it's
important that we have a position and that we take it and we state
it to the American people.

<HEAD>AP's Debate Judges Say Dukakis Won, Barely</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Associated Press panel of six veteran
debate judges gave Michael Dukakis a narrow edge over George Bush
in their first presidential debate Sunday night.
   Three judges rated Dukakis the winner and three picked Bush, but
the Democrat got the most points overall on their ballots, 144-141.
   The judges used a scorecard modeled after the kind used in
collegiate and scholastic debates. A perfect score would have been
180 points.
   The judges gave Dukakis top marks for presentation and
organization, while Bush bested his opponent in refutation and
reasoning, they said. They rated the candidates even in evidence
and cross-examination.
   Separately, an ABC poll of 639 registered voters who watched on
television gave the debate nod to Dukakis, 44 percent to 36
percent, with 20 percent calling it a tie.
   Those polled by ABC had been contacted by the network prior to
the debate and, at that time, 48 percent supported Dukakis, 46
percent backed Bush and 6 percent were undecided. After the debate,
52 percent said they supported Dukakis, 45 percent supported Bush
and 3 percent were undecided _ a shift toward Dukakis that was too
slight to be statistically meaningful given the poll's 4.5 percent
margin or error.
   As for the Associated Press panel of judges, James M. Copeland,
national executive secretary of the National Forensic League in
Ripon, Wis., who scored it 23-21 for Dukakis, said, ``Bush was
choppy and fumbling in a lot of his answers. Dukakis was nervous
but clearly in command. He was more direct and substantive.''
   James J. Unger, director of the National Forensics Institute at
American University in Washington and chairman of the AP panel,
gave Bush a 25-24 edge, but said, ``There was no knockout punch by
either party.''
   Bush ``did a good job of mixing the words and the music. ... He
offered a vision of where the country was going and a reasonable
roadmap of how to get there,'' said Unger.
   Melissa Maxcy Wade, who like Unger has judged every presidential
debate for the AP since 1976, said, ``It's the first time I've ever
heard the candidates laughed at by the audience. Bush was laughed
at twice, on Iran-Contra and the abortion question, and Dukakis was
laughed at on crime.''
   Wade, director of forensics at Emory University in Atlanta,
scored it 25-22 for Dukakis. She said Bush rambled, while Dukakis
``did a good job defending himself on patriotism.''
   William Southworth, director of forensics and professor of
speech at the University of Redlands, Calif., scored it 27-26 for
Bush. In the foreign policy half of the debate, he said, ``there
were so many positions that Bush articulated that Dukakis never
responded to.''
   L.D. Naegelin, speech and theater arts consultant for the North
East Independent School District, San Antonio, Texas, who scored it
25-23 for Bush, said, ``Bush came across with much more sense of
control than did Dukakis. ... I particularly liked his `I'll take
all the blame if you give me half the credit.'''
   ``That was a great line, but he immediately stepped on it,''
said Frank Sferra, director of forensics at J.K. Mullen High School
in Denver and president of the National Forensic League, who scored
it 23-21 for Dukakis.
   ``Dukakis was better organized. I thought Bush lost it a couple
of times during the debate,'' said Sferra.
   The judges watched the debate on television in their own
hometowns, using a scorecard modeled after the American Forensic
Association Debate Ballot for collegiate and scholastic debates.
   They awarded one to five points in each of six categories:
reasoning, evidence, organization, refutation, cross-examination
and presentation. A 1 was poor; 2 fair; 3 average; 4 excellent, and
5 superior.
   Each judge could award a maximum of 30 points. A perfect score
would have been 180.
   Here are the candidates' combined scores:

<HEAD>U.N. Leader Leaves For Paris After Wrapping Up African Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar left this west African country for Paris on
Saturday after briefing President Felix Houphouet-Boigny on his
efforts to settle southern African conflicts.
   Ivorian radio, in announcing the U.N. leader's arrival Saturday
morning from Angola, said Houphouet-Boigny's government urges
negotiations to settle conflicts in Angola and South-West Africa,
commonly known as Namibia.
   Perez de Cuellar said the United Nations is close to
implementing a plan for the independence of Namibia from South
African rule, the official Angolan news agency ANGOP reported
Saturday.
   He also said the United Nations will send a technical team to
South Africa and Namibia shortly to assess the needs of a U.N.
peacekeeping force for Namibia, the agency said in a report
monitored in Lisbon, Portugal.
   ANGOP said Perez de Cuellar held separate talks with Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and with Sam Nujoma, the leader
of the South-West African People's Organization. The group is
fighting South African forces for Namibian independence.
   Cuban troops are backing Angola in its fight against U.S.- and
South African-backed rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
   The United Nations has recognized the South-West African
People's Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the
Namibian people.
   But Perez de Cuellar, after meeting in Pretoria last week with
South African President P.W. Botha, said Friday all political
parties would be treated equally by U.N. administrators who will
supervise the territory during the transition to independence.
   South Africa has agreed to grant independence to the territory,
which it has ruled since World War I, if an agreement on the
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban forces from Angola can be reached with
Luanda.
   Talks on the Cuban troop issue were scheduled to resume Monday
in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, with the timetable for
withdrawal the key issue. South Africa wants them out before
Namibia gains independence. Angola has said it would take three to
four years.
   U.S.-sponsored peace talks between Angola, Cuba and South Africa
led to an agreement in August for the Namibian independence process
to begin in November as a move toward a regional peace settlement.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 11 grafs to UPDATE with threat of strike by train

preparation. Picks up 6th graf pvs, ``It'll be ...''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor leaders for Bay Area Rapid Transit
train operators threatened to halt service Sunday unless the agency
stops teaching supervisors how to drive trains as preparation for a
strike by another union.
   ``Since there isn't a strike, our union's position is BART
cannot train people to do our work when we're still there on the
property,'' said Hank White, president of the Amalgamated Transit
Union.
   Although it isn't striking, the transit union, which represents
500 station agents and train operators, has promised to honor
picket lines by United Public Employees Union.
   The transit agency started classes Saturday because of a
threatened strike at 12:01 a.m. Monday by 1,200 janitors,
maintenance workers and clerks represented by Local 790.
   At first, White threatened to order train operators to get off
their trains at the end of their routes starting at 2 p.m. Saturday
unless the classes were canceled.
   BART spokesman Mike Healy said the training was ``temporarily''
discontinued. White said he expected the classes to resume Sunday.
   ``If that happens we will instruct our train operators to
complete their runs, but go no farther than the end of the line and
then to stand by the trains and await further instructions,'' White
said Saturday night.
   ``We're not going to stand by and let management learn to drive
our trains when we're not even on strike,'' White said.
   Meantime, some 100,000 commuters face the threat of gridlock
this week as both sides in a contract dispute predict a strike
against the 71{-mile train system.
   A state mediator Saturday succeeded in getting representatives
from BART and the United Public Employees Union to resume
negotiations, but initial efforts at averting the strike failed.
The two groups, plus the mediator, planned to meet late into the
night.
   ``There are a bunch of people scurrying around trying to see if
they can get this thing settled,'' said BART board member Howard
Abelson. ``But it's not looking too good.''
   ``It'll be holy hell,'' said 29-year-old Tracy Hughes, a bank
teller who relies on BART to get her to San Francisco from her
Oakland home.
   Officials say if everyone abandoned by the train system went for
a car, it would increase the number of rush-hour vehicles that now
compete for position on the 8.4-mile San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge by 50 percent.
   The disputed contract proposals involve profits from retirement
fund investments, union activity during work hours, sick leave
restrictions and overtime.
   To meet the strike threat, BART announced managers would run a
reduced schedule of trains on Monday.
   The two unions have been working without a contract since June.

   Thousands of Japanese waited in the rain outside
the Imperial Palace Sunday to pray for Emperor Hirohito, but the
health of the world's oldest monarch remained precarious.
   Imperial officials said the 87-year-old emperor continued to
hemorrhage and his condition remained serious, although his
temperature declined Sunday from the dangerous level of Saturday.
   ``It appears that his internal bleeding is continuing,''
Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda told reporters
Sunday.
   Imperial officials said the emperor's temperature at
midafternoon was 98.4 compared to his normal body temperature of
about 95.9 and his pulse rate was 84.
   They said the emperor received another blood transfusion Sunday
of .85 pints, bringing the total of his transfusions since last
Monday to 5.53 pints.
   The officials said the large amounts of blood given the emperor
to replace that lost from bleeding had reduced his blood's ability
to coagulate and made it more difficult to stop the hemorrhaging.
   Thousands of people ignored a Sunday morning rain and waited
outside the palace in central Tokyo to pray for the emperor's
health and sign registries for well-wishers. More than 175,000 have
signed.
   On Saturday, relatives arrived in black sedans after the palace
announced the monarch's temperature was rising rapidly. By
midafternoon it hit 102.6 degrees, the highest since Hirohito
vomited blood after an intestinal hemorrhage late Monday. The fever
dropped to 100.2 Saturday evening.
   Court physicians gave the emperor 1.28 pints of blood through
the day after finding signs of further intestinal bleeding. They
gave him 0.85 pints Friday. Plans to administer high-calorie
nutrients into Hirohito's chest were scrapped after doctors deemed
the emperor too weak, reports said.
   Aside from two small ice cubes Thursday, the emperor has been
unable to take food and continued to receive intravenous treatment
through a vein in his arm.
   For the first time since the crisis began, palace officials
acknowledged Hirohito's condition was serious.
   Kyodo News Service and the Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second-largest
newspaper, reported the emperor is suffering from cancer of the
upper intestine, in the area where the duodenum and pancreas meet.
Asahi said the cancer may have spread to the pancreas.
   The agency lodged protests with Asahi and Kyodo for their
reports, but issued no denials.
   ``The position of the Imperial Household Agency is not to allow
such (speculation) while the emperor is still conscious and
fighting his illness,'' Maeda said.
   Crown Prince Akihito, who assumed the full roster of imperial
duties Thursday, continued his daily shuttles Saturday to his
father's Fukiage Palace from his nearby residence. Under the
Constitution, the emperor has no real power but signs documents
already approved by the government and serves as a symbol of Japan.
   Akihito was joined by Prince Mikasa, Hirohito's younger brother;
princesses Chichibu and Takamatsu, his widowed sisters-in-law, and
Prince Hitachi, his second son.
   Maeda said they spoke briefly with the emperor.
   Prince Aya, Akihito's son, planned to interrupt his studies at
Britain's Oxford University to return to Japan, the palace said.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno canceled plans to leave for New York
Sunday to attend the U.N. General Assembly, the ministry said.
Other Cabinet ministers also canceled plans to leave Tokyo.
   News reports said organizers were postponing festivals,
fireworks displays and moon-viewing gatherings out of deference to
the emperor. It was an unusual trend not seen even when the emperor
underwent surgery for the first time in September 1987.
   Physicians have said the intestinal hemorrhaging was coming from
the site of the surgery. Hirohito was diagnosed as having chronic
pancreatitis and surgeons performed an intestinal bypass.
   More than 50,000 visitors turned out in the rain Saturday to
sign registries at the palace.
   A restaurant owner recited a Buddhist prayer outside the palace
and said: ``Japan is not Japan without him. Japan's prosperity,
peace and our spiritual well-being are owed to him to the greatest
extent.''
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index fell during Saturday's
half-day trading session from concern over Hirohito, analysts said.
   ``There may be no clear logic to why stocks go down when the
head of the state dies, but it creates a serious uncertainty,''
said Jeff Bahrenburg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.

   Assailants shot and killed a
part-time soldier early Sunday in an ambush outside his rural home,
police said.
   The soldier, returning home from night duty with the Ulster
Defense Regiment, died in a hail of bullets as he walked from his
car to his house outside Armagh, 33 miles southwest of Belfast, a
police spokeswoman said.
   No group claimed responsibility, but the predominantly
Protestant regiment, a British army auxiliary, is frequently
targeted by the mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to drive the British out of
Northern Ireland and unite the province, where Protestants
outnumber Catholics 3 to 2, with the Irish Republic under socialist
rule.
   Police recovered about 30 spent cartridges from the scene, the
police spokeswoman said. She spoke on condition of anonymity in
accordance with British practice.
   The victim was not immediately identified. More than half of the
Ulster Defense Regiment's 6,500 members are part-timers who operate
mainly in rural areas. Ninety-seven percent are Protestant.
   Eleven Ulster Defense Regiment soldiers have died in violence in
Northern Ireland this year.
   On Friday, Protestant gunmen using a sledgehammer burst into a
Catholic man's house in west Belfast before dawn and shot and
killed him when he got out of bed to investigate.

   Two explosions jolted Moslem west Beirut,
police said Sunday, as a dispute between rival Moslem and Christian
governments threatened to rekindle Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.
   Police said a rocket-propelled grenade was fired late Saturday
night into the Bristol hotel and a dynamite charge exploded later
near a Syrian army checkpoint one block from the hotel.
   There were no casualties from either blast, police said. The
grenade gutted an unoccupied room on the hotel's third floor and
fire engines quickly extinguished the blaze.
   There was no claim of responsibility for either of the
explosions, which came as the two rival governments pressed their
claims to legitimacy, pushing the already fractured country to the
brink of formal partition.
   The U.S. Embassy said Saturday it had evacuated 22 junior
employees, all Americans, reflecting Washington's unease at the
worst political crisis in Lebanon in 45 years of independence.
   On Saturday, the Syrian-backed government under acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, instructed its defense
minister to order army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic, to quit the rival cabinet.
   President Amin Gemayel appointed Aoun prime minister Thursday,
five minutes before his six-year presidential term ended.
   Aoun rejected Hoss' order and said he would send an emissary to
argue his case with the governement of Syria, Lebanon's main power
broker.
   There was no indication from the Syrian capital, Damascus,
Sunday whether the government was ready to receive Aoun's emissary.

   Four people were killed and six
others were injured when a grenade found by one of them exploded
accidentally, the official Philippines News Agency said Sunday.
   The incident took place Friday when 12-year-old Angelo Nadong
found the grenade near the village of Udok, about 24 miles south of
Iloilo on Panay Island, the news agency said. He brought it to the
family home where it exploded, the report said.
   Army Col. Jorge Vallejera was quoted as saying the grenade may
have been dropped accidentally by military planes that strafed a
guerrilla camp of the communist New People's Army in the area three
weeks ago.
   Vallejera said the grenade also could have been dropped
accidentally by the guerrillas, who operate on Panay Island.
   Three of the dead were brothers, including Angelo, Gerry Nadong,
9, and Herandi Nadong, 23, the news agency said. The fourth victim,
Hernani Fernando, died in a hospital. His age was not given.

   Bombs exploded at a Durban
railway station and in the parking lot of a motel along the East
London beachfront, but no injuries were reported, police said
Sunday.
   The East London explosion went off late Saturday after a member
of the public discovered the device under a car, giving police time
to evacuate the area, police said. It damaged nine cars.
   The bomb at the Berea railroad station in Durban, where railroad
workers have been arrested for staging strike demonstrations,
exploded about 3 a.m. Sunday, causing minimal damage, police said.
   The two cities are 230 miles apart on the eastern coast of South
Africa.
   About 50 bombings in the country this year have killed 17 people
and injured more than 200.
   The government has blamed most on the outlawed African National
Congress, some of whose military leaders publicly stated a policy
in June to increase attacks in white areas and intensify its armed
battle to end apartheid.
   Several bombings have also been targeted at anti-apartheid
organizations and individuals. They were set in areas frequented
only by blacks, leading government opponents to charge that white
vigilantes or a secret unit of the security forces may be
responsible for some explosions.
   Censorship rules imposed under the national state of emergency
ban or restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions,
treatment of detainees, most forms of peaceful protest and a broad
range of statements the government considers subversive, including
calls for an election boycott and criticism of the military.
   Under apartheid, the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The Irish Republican Army said
two of its gunmen shot and killed a part-time soldier early Sunday
in an ambush outside his rural home.
   Police said Stephen McKinney, 22, was returning home from duty
with the Ulster Defense Regiment when he was caught in a hail of
more than 40 bullets between his car and his house outside Armagh,
33 miles southwest of Belfast.
   McKinney died on his way to hospital after the 1 a.m. attack,
said a spokeswoman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern
Ireland's police force. The gunmen escaped across nearby fields.
   British news reports said McKinney, who was single, had just
completed his final shift for the regiment and planned to move to
mainland Britain later Sunday to study business management.
   The predominantly Protestant Ulster Defense Regiment, a British
army auxiliary, frequently is targeted by the mainly Roman Catholic
IRA. More than half of the regiment's 6,500 members serve part-time
and operate mainly in rural areas.
   McKinney was the 11th member of the Ulster Defense Regiment and
the 35th member of the security forces to be killed in Northern
Ireland this year.
   Lt. Col. Clive Mantell, McKinney's commanding officer, said in a
statement: ``Private Stephen McKinney was three weeks short of his
23rd birthday when he was so treacherously ambushed at his home
near Armagh.''
   ``For three years he had loyally and bravely served in the UDR.
This was his way of serving his country,'' Mantell said.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to end British rule in the

Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   The IRA in North Armagh claimed responsibility for Sunday's

   Network documentaries, a string of new books,
an all-night Capitol vigil and memorials by former Peace Corps
volunteers and PT boat veterans will help commemorate the 25th
anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November.
   But family members plan a low-profile remembrance, much
different from the 1983 nationally televised observance of the 20th
anniversary of that fateful day in Dallas.
   ``They have tried to get away from commemorating the day of his
death and try to celebrate the day of his birth,'' said Melody
Miller, an aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. The senator and
other family members have said they will not grant interviews.
   Some family members likely will follow tradition and quietly
visit JFK's grave site at the Arlington National Cemetery, while
others join family matriarch Rose Kennedy at her regular daily Mass
at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., said Ms. Miller, a
long-time Kennedy aide who worked for the late Robert F. Kennedy.
   Despite the family's low profile, there are a series of events
scheduled around the country to remember the 35th president, his
spirit and the events surrounding Nov. 22, 1963.
   In Washington, 500 original members of the Kennedy-created Peace
Corps will hold a 24-hour vigil in the rotunda of the Capitol, said
Dennis Grubb, a Manhattan investment banker and former Kennedy
advance man who went to Colombia in 1961 with the first wave of
corps volunteers.
   Grubb said each former volunteer will read brief eulogies, many
written in Peace Corps diaries during the hours and days following
the assassination.
   After the vigil, a memorial service will be held at St.
Matthew's Cathedral with Sargent Shriver, who was JFK's
brother-in-law and the first Peace Corps director, and Bill Moyers,
the television journalist who was an assistant corps director.
   Across the river, the Green Berets will conduct their
traditional Nov. 22 wreath-laying ceremony at the Kennedy grave
site. But cemetery historian Tom Sherlock said starting next year,
the Green Berets will follow the family's lead and hold the
ceremony on JFK's birthday, May 29.
   On Nov. 20, surviving members of Kennedy's 50-officer class,
which received its PT boat training in Rhode Island in the fall of
1942, will hold a service at the cemetery and their own wreath
ceremony.
   ``We kept our friendships up all through the years,'' said Fred
Rosen, a business consultant in Dalton, Ga., and former Navy
lieutenant commander who is organizing the event. ``It's our own
class reunion.''
   In Boston, 25 roses will be displayed near the entrance of the
Kennedy Library and admission will be free for visitors that day.
There also will be a special program for high school students ``who
have no memory of President Kennedy and the impact of his death on
the world,'' said library spokesman Frank Rigg.
   ``That day is usually a quiet one here,'' Rigg said. ``It's more
a day of quiet reflection and meditation.''
   ``I usually go to church, light a candle and have a drink,''
said David F. Powers, one of JFK's closest associates who is the
library's curator.
   In Dallas, preparations continue for a museum at the Texas
School Book Depository where assassin Lee Harvey Oswald gunned down
Kennedy as the presidential motorcade rode through Dealey Plaza.
The museum will not be ready until next year.
   In Pennsylvania, scholars and researchers who have devoted much
of the past quarter century to investigating the Kennedy
assassination will gather at the University of Pittsburgh for a
series of seminars.
   But television is likely to dominate the anniversary-related
activities.
   In addition to a string of local JFK specials, CBS, NBC and PBS
all are planning extensive prime-time features on the assassination.
   CBS News will air a two-hour special Nov. 17, anchored by Dan
Rather, that will show highlights of the network's original 53
hours of live coverage.
   ``It starts with the bulletin that interrupted `As The World
Turns' on Nov. 22 and ends with the burial of President Kennedy,''
said CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees. Walter Cronkite was the anchor at
the time and Rather, who is now the network's anchorman, was the
New Orleans bureau chief and lead reporter in Dallas.
   NBC plans a two-hour documentary the night of the anniversary,
anchored by Tom Brokaw, that will feature old footage along with
interviews.
   PBS has two JFK specials. A Nov. 15 segment of the series
``Nova'' will focus on new analyses of assassination evidence.
   ``We undertook an investigation, using modern science and
technology, of the physical evidence connected to the assassination
of President Kennedy, including ballistics, acoustics, photographic
evidence and autopsy evidence,'' said producer Robert Richter.
   ``We have developed some information that is new that has
previously not been developed and we have new findings that have
previously not been available. We've hired our own experts and they
have conducted tests for us.''
   Richter said in addition to producing a three-dimensional
computerized model of Dealey Plaza, PBS received permission from
the Kennedy family to examine photos taken at the autopsy.
   Another PBS special, scheduled for Nov. 21, includes interviews
with Kennedy friends, associates and others to ``try to recapture
the impact of the Kennedy assassination and its meaning 25 years
later,'' said David Merrill, a spokesman at WNET in New York.
   ABC had no plans for a JFK special, although the network is
working on a mini-series on the Kennedy clan based on historian
Doris Kearns Goodwin book, ``The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys.''
   A dozen new JFK books are being published around the anniversary.
   Some celebrate Kennedy's life and times, including a compilation
of his speeches, statements and writings by former aide Theodore
Sorenson, a biography and an assembly of Life magazine photographs.
   Others focus on the assassination, such as a collection of new
letters from leading political, sports and entertainment figures
discussing their recollections of the assassination and its impact
on their lives, including contributions from Michael Dukakis and
George Bush.
   And several books talk about assassination theories _ old and
new.
   Warren Commission counsel David W. Belin has written a book
defending the panel's oft-maligned investigation and conclusion
that Oswald acted alone, while two others look at the possible role
of the Louisiana mob in the slaying.

<HEAD>Trees Seen as Defense Against Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trees, forest upon forest of them, are being
advanced as one of mankind's best friends for future efforts to
combat global overheating from the ``greenhouse effect.''
   Right now, however, trees represent one of the Earth's worst
enemies.
   Left alone, trees are storage ``sinks'' that consume large
quantities of carbon dioxide, the worst of the greenhouse gases
that scientists say are collecting in the atmosphere and trapping
heat that once escaped into space.
   But a tree felled by a logger or consumed by fire is doubly
dangerous: not only will it no longer consume carbon dioxide, its
death releases stored carbon dioxide to join the atmospheric
accumulation that scientists say will produce major global climate
changes in the 21st century.
   The scientists' warnings are coming at a time when forests,
particularly in developing nations, are being destroyed at record
rates, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was told
last week.
   Focusing on the role of forests in the greenhouse equation, the
committee heard that the headline-grabbing forest fires that
ravaged some 4 million acres of the American West this summer were
relatively small potatoes.
   ``It is generally agreed that global deforestation, particularly
in the tropics, accounts for approximately 20 percent of the annual
injection of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,'' said Daniel
Dudek, senior economist for the Environmental Defense Fund.
   ``Annually, forest destruction producing these emissions equals
an area slightly larger than the state of Indiana, or more than
24.5 million acres,'' he said. ``This global total dwarfs our own
domestic losses this summer.''
   David Wirth, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said that because of ``massive destruction'' of forests,
``Brazil currently ranks third, after the United States and the
Soviet Union, in overall contribution to the carbon burden of the
atmosphere.''
   Cutting down tropical forests to bring land into agriculture is
especially critical in the Amazon basin, according to Robert
McNeal, of NASA's earth sciences and applications division.
   ``If only half of the Amazon basin were covered with forests, it
would absorb 20 percent of the carbon which is presently released
into the atmosphere'' globally, he said.
   He also said the basin is the source of about 12 percent of the
methane, another greenhouse gas, that reaches the atmosphere from
wetlands. Replacing forests with wetlands or rice agriculture would
likely mean more methane production in the tropics, he said.
   Committee witnesses said that unlike the United States and
Europe, which actively plant new trees to replace harvested
forests, many Third World trees are not replaced.
   ``Only a very small percentage of the world's tropical forests
are being managed,'' said Richard Bissell, assistant administrator
of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is now
stressing resource management to countries receiving its assistance.
   Planting new forests to absorb carbon dioxide sounds like a
simple solution _ until its magnitude is considered.
   ``Sequestering five gigatons per year of carbon from the
atmosphere, an amount roughly equal to current annual additions,
would require between 1.28 billion and 1.65 billion acres of new
plantation forests,'' Dudek said. ``By comparison, the total land
area of the United States is 2.27 billion acres.''
   Gregg Marland of the environmental sciences division of Oak
Ridge National Laboratory estimated that under current U.S. forest
management practices, this nation would need about 4 billion acres
of trees to offset its emissions of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere from all sources.
   The witnesses said a minimum anti-greenhouse strategy requires
that new sources of carbon to the atmosphere should be offset by
carbon traps, such as new trees.
   Marland gave a formula for offsetting carbon dioxide emissions
from a coal-fired 1,000 megawatt power plant: surround it with
sycamores spaced four feet apart to a radius of 15.3 miles and
harvest the trees every four years because younger trees absorb
more carbon dioxide than mature trees.
   Gary Moll, vice president of the American Forestry Association,
said Third World tropical forests are not the only places trees are
being lost.
   ``Our urban forests are dying,'' he said. ``A 1987 survey done
by the association indicated that on average four (urban) trees are
dying or being removed for every new one planted today,'' he said.
   ``We estimate that there are somewhere on the order of 100
million `tree spaces' in urban communities where new trees are
urgently needed,'' Moll said. ``Planting those trees could result
in a savings of ... as much as 18 million tons of carbon dioxide
production a year.''
   Dale Robertson, chief of the U.S. Forest Service said that trees
offer a partial solution to global warming, but he sounded an
ominous note about the droughts that scientists say will be part of
the greenhouse process.
   Robertson said the dry years have had ``a serious effect on our
forest resources,'' sparking killer fires, weakening seedlings and
leaving drought-stressed trees more susceptible to insect attack.
   ``A serious potential effect of a change in our world's climate
would be changes in tree growth and yield,'' Robertson said.

   Populations of the Pacific islands under U.S.
jurisdiction are skyrocketing, but departures are holding down
growth in Puerto Rico, the Census Bureau reported Sunday.
   Leading in growth was the island of Guam, where net immigration
helped boost population sharply.
   Both military personnel and civilian workers from the
Philippines helped increase Guam's population, the report said.
   Between 1980 and 1987 the population of Guam jumped by 24,400,
or 23.1 percent, to 130,400, the Bureau said. Of the increase,
5,200 were immigrants.
   The Northern Mariana Islands were second in growth, increasing
21.1 percent to a total of 20,300 people last year. This increase
was largely from births, however.
   And American Samoa added 19 percent to its population to climb
to 38,400, also due to an increase in births.
   On the other side of the nation, the U.S. Virgin Islands had
population growth of 9.8 percent to a 1987 total of 106,100 people.
Natural increase overcame the departure of 4,400 people to keep
growth ahead of the U.S. national average of 7.4 percent.
   That was not the case, however, with Puerto Rico, where the
departure of 227,000 residents between 1980 and 1987 held the
islands's overall growth to just 3.0 percent during the period.
   Puerto Rico's total population was 3,292,000 last year, up
95,000 from the 1980 census.

   Members of the Grateful Dead, those rock 'n'
roll icons from the psychedelic counterculture of the late '60s,
have joined the concerts-for-causes circuit.
   The band, which played at the legendary Woodstock festival and
has been a rock mainstay for 23 years with songs like ``Steel
Magnolia,'' ``Casey Jones,'' and ``Uncle John's Band,'' joined
Bruce Hornsby and the Range, Suzanne Vega, and Daryl Hall and John
Oates on stage Saturday night to raise money to protect tropical
rain forests.
   The group pledged to make fighting deforestation a lifelong
commitment. ``We'll probably be doing this until we're pushing up
daisies,'' said rhythm guitarist Bob Weir.
   Lead guitarist Jerry Garcia, the Dead's spiritual guru, said
he's concerned about the world his children will inherit.
   ``For me, this is one of those things that 20 years ago there
were people who were talking about how dire all this stuff was
then. And the alarming part is, nothing has happened in between. .
.. It is up to regular people, which we think we are, to do
something about this,'' he said.
   Environmentalists contend that deforestation of the rain
forests, through cattle ranching, farming and timber harvesting,
contributes to the global warming trend known as the greenhouse
effect. Concert organizers hoped to raise $650,000 for the
Rainforest Action Network, Greenpeace International, Cultural
Survival and other environmental groups.

   Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, gave
his wife a warm kiss on the grounds of Admiralty House Sunday
following a monthlong separation for the new parents.
   The Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, arrived ahead of
her husband last week. They have been apart since shortly after
their daughter, Princess Beatrice, was born Aug. 8.
   The couple are here to officiate at the Oct. 1 Bicentennial
Naval Salute, comprising some 40 warships and supports vessels in
the biggest such formation in Sydney Harbor. Beatrice remained in
England with her nanny.
   Andrew was helicoptered to the mainland from his warship, the
HMS Edinburgh, which anchored offshore after a tour of the Far
East. Admiralty House is the Sydney home of Governor-General Sir
Ninian Stephen.
   The royal couple are scheduled to depart Oct. 7.

   Queen Elizabeth II has awarded former Maryland
Sen. Charles Mathias an honorary knighthood in recognition of his
contribution to Anglo-American relations, the Foreign Office said
Sunday.
   Mathias, 66, will receive his award at the British Embassy in
Washington on Oct. 20, the office said.
   In Buckingham Palace parlance, Mathias will be made an honorary
Knight Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order
of the British Empire. While he won't be allowed to call himself
Sir Charles _ an honor reserved for British subjects _ he is
entitled to use the initials KBE after his name.
   Mathias, who retired from the Senate last year, was considered
one of the most liberal Republicans during his 18 years as a
senator. During his tenure, he sponsored legislation to mark the
bicentennial of the Constitution and the 500th anniversary of
Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New World.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci was given
the keys to his hometown of Scranton and neighboring Wilkes-Barre,
where he passed on this tip to whoever succeeds him: ``Be sure you
have long days because it takes a lot of time.''
   Military bands, honor guards and various local top brass all
saluted the defense secretary Saturday during ``Frank Carlucci
Day.''
   Although Carlucci was born in Scranton, he was also honored at
Wilkes-Barre for his aid in obtaining federal assistance after
floods devasted the town some 16 years ago. There he visited a
National Guard armory to help the unit celebrate its 213th
anniversary and commemorate 33 soldiers who died in a train
accident in Ohio.
   Along with the keys to both cities, the secretary received a
model of a Civil War cannon and a bronze replica of the statue his
grandfather had built in Scranton's square.

   Boxer Mitch Green, whose August street brawl
with Mike Tyson left the heavyweight champ wearing a cast on his
hand, was arrested for the second time in four days after he was
charged with assaulting a woman.
   Green, 31, was charged with third-degree assault in the Saturday
night incident, said police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   The woman claimed Green struck her, causing pain to her chest
and arm. Green was taken to an unidentified hospital for
psychiatric evaluation after he became violent at the police
precinct.
   The down-and-out boxer had been arrested Wednesday on charges of
disorderly conduct after police found him ``ranting and raving''
and ``acting irrationally'' on a street. He was was charged with
driving with a suspended license and seventh-degree criminal
possession of a controlled substance.
   Green lost a bout with Tyson for the United States Boxing
Association heavyweight title in 1986. In the Aug. 23 scuffle, the
two fought outside a 24-hour clothing boutique in Harlem. Green
pressed assault charges but dropped them three days later.

   Babe Lyons scored with 39 seconds left to
avenge a 50-year-old trouncing, leading the Colfax Bulldogs to a
6-0 victory over St. John in the first Codger Bowl.
   Saturday's game was a rematch of a 1938 contest that saw Whitman
County high school champion St. John defeat Colfax, 14-0. Most of
the players on those two teams, now in their late 60s and early
70s, were on the Bulldog field in front of about 2,000 family
members and friends.
   The two schools, 15 miles apart, are now in different leagues
and no longer play each other.
   The Codger Bowl was dreamed up by actor John Crawford, who was
known as Cleve Richardson when he played for the Bulldogs. Crawford
said he wanted to make amends for a dropped pass during the 1938
game, and he caught all four passes thrown to him Saturday.
   ``If I had the speed I had 50 years ago, I would have gone all
the way,'' he said of one of his receptions.
   Rules of the one-handed touch-football game were casual. The
teams played with eight men to a side to simplify the action and
make passing easier. There were unlimited timeouts and
substitutions. After playing 12-minute quarters in the first half,
the players shortened them to eight minutes in the second.
   Players from both sides, some limping noticeably, hooted when
Crawford said he wanted another Codger Bowl next year.
   The rematch became a major event for Colfax, a farming
crossroads town of 3,000 about 60 miles south of Spokane. A parade,
community barbecue and concert were held in conjunction with the
game.

   She played Ernest Hemingway's favorite cat in the
TV movie ``Hemingway.'' She performed tricks for a segment on PBS'
``Living With Animals.'' She's a November model in the nationally
distributed 1989 ``365 Cats Calendar.''
   And now Princess Kitty is the sole animal in the International
Platform Association, a respected 5,000-member trade group that
includes Bob Hope, Art Linkletter and Isaac Asimov among its
speechmakers on the lecture circuit.
   Granting Princess membership began as ``sort of a joke, (but)
actually it isn't that odd,'' because the IPA could offer good
contacts for the cat, said executive director Luvie Owens.
   The 3-year-old feline, with such talents as piano playing,
jumping through hoops and shaking hands, has her own business cards
and fan club. She is incorporated, pays taxes and is registered
with agents.
   ``She's earned enough to pay her own way for the rest of her
life. And she's treated me to some trips around the country,'' says
owner Karen Payne, who won't disclose how much the white-and-brown
splotched cat pulls in.
   Despite the royal title, Princess has a dubious pedigree. Payne
rescued her from the streets when the cat was about to tangle with
a dog.
   ``I looked into her eyes and at that moment I fell in love. She
bit me, but never mind; I was a goner,'' recalls Payne. The cat,
who vets later found had once been shot, continued biting, so Payne
picked up a book on training cats to improve her pet's manners.
   Since then, Princess has learned to shake paws, come and stay on
command, jump over barriers, play a toy piano, slam-dunk little
basketballs and open a kitty-sized mailbox to fetch mail. Payne, a
Fulbright Fellow and no-nonsense reporter for the Miami News, is
always working on new tricks.
   ``I'm firmly convinced that Princess Kitty is the next feline
star,'' says Payne, who admits to having had second thoughts about
having the cat spayed. ``Princess Kitty is an unusual talent.''

   Security forces shot and killed 12 people
Sunday, government radio said. Lawlessness persisted a week after
Gen. Saw Maung seized power and moved to crush dissent.
   Radio Rangoon said five people were wounded and 16 arrested in
five lootings in Rangoon and that two mobs violated the 8 p.m.-4
a.m. curfew imposed by the new military regime. The looters were
after rice, gasoline and corrugated iron sheets, it said.
   The bloodiest incident occurred when security forces shot seven
people to death while halting a crowd of 100 looters Sunday night
at the state-owned Five Star Shipping Line near Rangoon River, the
radio said.
   It said two others were killed when security forces dispersed a
mob of 1,000 people looting a government rice warehouse, and three
died while looting of another government warehouse.
   The government says security forces have killed more than 250
civilians, mostly people described as looters, since the Sept. 18
coup. Western diplomats believe more have died, including many
unarmed demonstrators who marched to demand democracy after 26
years of authoritarian rule.
   Security officials in Thailand said Sunday that Burmese student
leaders have been fleeing across the border almost daily after the
military crackdown drove them underground.
   Pinit Sunantha, a Border Patrol Police official in northern Tak
province of Thailand, said student leaders have been crossing into
Thailand almost daily, but did not provide an exact figure.
   A group of 62 students, teachers and villagers crossed the
narrow Moei River into Tak on Friday, some swimming and others
riding in long boats, Pinit said.
   On Saturday, a spokesman for Burma's strongest ethnic rebel
group said about 90 student protesters fled to his group's border
base camps, where they may get military training. The spokesman for
the Karen National Union said about 200 more students were on their
way to the bases.
   A woman who identified herself as from the All Burma Students
Union telephoned The Associated Press bureau Sunday in Rangoon to
warn students not to proceed to the border area because of the
danger.
   ``Their security condition is extremely grave. Please try to
stop them immediately,'' she said before hanging up.
   Diplomats believe the military apparently established effective
control of the country after the coup, ending street marches and
breaking up protest centers in dozens of towns nationwide.
   Rangoon residents have ventured out of their homes only to shop,
and a state-owned newspaper announced strict rules from the Road
Transport Board requiring pedestrians to walk facing traffic and in
single file along the side of roads.
   ``No one must stop, walk, sit or play on the roads without
sufficient reason,'' said the rules published Thursday in the
Working People's Daily.
   It had no explanation why the rules were issued, and there were
no reports of government enforcement efforts.
   Saw Maung has repeatedly pledged to hold multiparty elections
once peace is restored to the impoverished nation, but he has set
no exact timetable.
   Three key opposition leaders _ Aung Gyi, Tin Oo and Aung San Suu
Kyi _ on Saturday announced the formation of ``The National United
Front for Democracy'' to bring together the millions of students,
Buddhist monks and government workers struggling for democracy.
   But their statement spelled out no specific strategy and did not
directly respond to the government offer of elections.
   The main anti-government activity is a general strike that began
Aug. 8 and paralyzed the government administration. Authorities
have ordered civil servants back to work by Oct. 3.
   The three opposition figures earlier sent Saw Maung a letter
asking for a halt to what they say have been the arrests of
students, Buddhist monks and other protest leaders.
   Diplomats say Saw Maung is a close associate of strongman Ne
Win, who seized power in a 1962 coup and ruled until July, when he
resigned after mass street protests.
   They say the coup may have been staged to preserve the ruling
military autocracy, the power behind the short-lived rule of Ne
Win's hard-line successor, Sein Lwin, and Maung Maung, the civilian
president ousted by Saw Maung.

   Syria on Sunday rejected Lebanon's
3-day-old Christian military government in favor of a rival
government declared by its Moslem allies. Two bombs exploded in
Syrian-controlled areas.
   The crisis threatened to formally partition the tiny
Mediterranean nation along sectarian lines and rekindle the 13-year
civil war, which killed 150,000 people.
   Syria's Al-Thawra daily, which speaks for President Hafez
Assad's government, branded the Christian Cabinet of Army Commander
Gen. Michel Aoun a ``military coup d'etat against legitimacy.''
   ``This government not only constitutes a coup against legitimate
state institutions and laws, but it is also a coup against the
historic chance to elect a new president and pave the way for
national reconciliation and salvation,'' it said in an editorial.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, backs the five-man
Cabinet of Sunni Moslem Prime Minister Salim Hoss, which includes
the two main Moslem militia chieftains, Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt and Shiite leader Nabih Berri.
   The Syrians maintain an estimated 40,000 troops in north and
east Lebanon as well as in Moslem areas of Beirut. With their Druse
and Shiite allies, they control 70 percent of the country. Lebanon
has 4,036 square miles and 4 million people.
   Police said attackers fired a rocket-propelled grenade into a
hotel in Syrian-controlled Moslem west Beirut during the night,
gutting an unoccupied third floor room.
   An hour later, a dynamite bomb exploded near a Syrian army
checkpoint a block from the hotel, police reported. No one was
injured in either attack.
   Firemen quickly put out the fire at the heavily guarded Bristol
Hotel, where Robert Franjieh, son of Syrian-backed former President
Suleiman Franjieh, has been staying since his father announced his
candidacy in Lebanon's abortive presidential election.
   An aide said the younger Franjieh left his fourth floor suite
for the family's summer resort of Ehden in north Lebanon hours
before the grenade attack.
   No one claimed responsibility for either incident. But they and
a string of bombings and attacks on Syrian forces over the last
year appeared to be aimed at discrediting Syria's peacekeeping role
in west Beirut.
   The deadlock stemmed from Parliament's failure to elect a
successor to President Amin Gemayel before his six-year term
expired at midnight Thursday.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, was named prime minister by Gemayel
minutes before his term ended.
   Hoss' Cabinet is all that remains of a national government under
Gemayel, a Maronite. But that administration, fractured along
sectarian lines, rarely even consulted with him and had not held a
full session for years.
   The Moslem leaders had threatened to declare a breakaway state
in territory controlled by their militias if Gemayel handed over
power to a Christian-led Cabinet.
   Under an unwritten covenant, Lebanon's president must be a
Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the Parliament
speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   ``Alas, this appears to be it,'' lamented Beirut's
Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation radio station. ``Unless a new
president is quickly elected, and this seems to need a miracle,
Lebanon is irrevocably partitioned.''
   Parliament failed three times from Aug. 18 up to Gemayel's
departure to elect his successor because militant Christians
rejected two Syrian-backed candidates, Suleiman Franjieh, a close
friend of Assad, and parliamentary deputy Mikhail Daher.
   Hoss became acting premier after Prime Minister Rashid Karami, a
Sunni, was assassinated in a bomb explosion aboard an army
helicopter in June 1987.
   On Saturday, Aoun's three-man Cabinet ordered civil servants not
to take any orders from the Hoss government.
   Hoss said in a statement broadcast Sunday by Moslem radio
stations: ``Gen. Aoun's Cabinet is illegal and unconstitutional.
Therefore it cannot issue orders or directives to anyone.''
   But Aoun appeared bent on pressing his quest for recognition. He
called all the Arab ambassadors in Lebanon to meet him Monday at
the presidential palace in suburban Baabda, northeast of Beirut.

   President Reagan, asked if he had any advice
for Democrat Michael Dukakis in his televised campaign debate with
Republican George Bush, said Sunday: ``I'd rather advise the other
guy.''
   When asked what advice he would give Bush, the president
repeated the answer he gave to the same question last week: ``Take
no prisoners.''
   The exchange with reporters occurred as the president returned
to the White House by helicopter from his Camp David, Md., retreat.

<TEXT>
   The Health Ministry on Sunday urged Israelis to
combat an outbreak of polio by observing rules of hygiene,
including washing fruit and vegetables with soap and water.
   The government set up a task force to improve the nation's
sewage treatment facilities, which have been blamed for at least
nine confirmed cases of polio near Tel Aviv, state radio and the
Health Ministry said.
   Health officials continued vaccination campaigns for the 200,000
people in and around the towns of Hadera, 30 milies north of Tel
Aviv, and Ramla and Lod, which are near the city.
   The Cabinet decided against universal immunization for the
country's 4.4 million population and instead agreed to continue
checking sewage and vaccinating people where contamination was
found.
   The Sea of Galilee, a main source of drinking water, was being
checked several times a day for purity, the radio said.
   All soldiers in the army and police officers are to be
vaccinated in areas where polio cases have been reported, the
government announced earlier.
   The Health Ministry published a notice in Sunday's newspapers,
which said:
   ``The public is again requested to carefully observe the rules
of personal hygiene _ washing hands with soap and water before
eating and after visiting the toilet and washing fruits and
vegetables with soap and water.''
   Panic-stricken Israelis besieged pharmacies to buy
self-administered vaccines, and some said they were boiling water
before drinking.
   ``We are simply terrified,'' said a woman living in Tel Aviv,
who spoke on condition of anonymity on the army radio. ``They will
vaccinate us all, for sure. They just don't want to frighten us.''
   Health officials denied that Israel faced an epidemic, but the
radio announced the number of a polio hotline and said it will
broadcast a two-hour program on polio on Tuesday.

additional detail on issues' link to presidential politics.</NOTE>

   Social initiatives from welfare to child care
are hanging in the balance as Congress draws toward adjournment,
increasingly impatient and preoccupied with presidential politics.
   In a year of rhetoric about the American family, lawmakers have
yet to complete action on major initiatives to raise the minimum
wage, expand and improve child care, reform the welfare system and
guarantee leave to workers with pressing family responsibilities.
   A number of appropriations bills, including one providing about
$300 billion for the Defense Department, have been approved in some
form, but differences remain between the House and Senate versions.
   Also on the incomplete roster is the biggest environmental bill
of the 100th Congress, a revision of the Clean Air Act to
strengthen the battle against urban air pollution, acid rain and
airborne toxic substances.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has warned
senators to be prepared for Saturday sessions if the 100th Congress
is to end by Oct. 16 _ two weeks beyond the original target date
for finishing business.
   The Senate has been mired for days on a bill to raise the
minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 over three years, unable to cut
off a filibuster mounted by conservative Republicans. The week
ended with no resolution and a vow to try again this week.
   Republican presidential candidate George Bush has become
involved in the debate, saying last week he would support a modest
increase in the minimum wage, but only if it is coupled with a
lower ``training wage.''
   The minimum wage, family leave and child care bills all have
become entangled in presidential politics, with Democrats trying to
get Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., to take positions
on social measures he has opposed in the past.
   House Democrats jumped on a Bush comment last week which seemed
to endorse the family leave act opposed by the administration,
saying in a letter that they would welcome his support.
   The family leave bill, opposed by small business lobbies, is
scheduled for consideration this week. The measure would guarantee
workers with a newborn, newly adopted or very ill child at least 10
weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave. Workers with serious medical
problems themselves would be entitled to at least 15 weeks of leave
without losing their jobs.
   Welfare negotiators were meeting Monday to discuss the latest
offers and counter-offers on an overhaul bill that would bolster
child support payments from absent parents and create a major jobs,
training and education program for welfare recipients.
   ``We haven't given birth yet but we're about in the ninth month
of gestation,'' said Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., as he emerged from a
meeting Friday.
   His Colorado colleague, Republican Sen. Bill Armstrong, was
slightly less optimistic about the bill's prospects. ``We're just
right on the brink _ again,'' he said. ``The conferees clearly want
a bill. The question is can we get something we can sell to our
colleagues.''
   The question is particularly acute in the House, where a handful
of negotiators led by Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., are firmly
opposed to a work requirement for two-parent families on welfare.
The Reagan administration is just as firm about its insistence that
the requirement be included.
   The latest Senate offer adds a degree of flexibility to the work
requirement and phases it in starting in 1991. The changes ``didn't
move Hawkins,'' according to his spokesman, Jay Butler.
   But other negotiators appeared headed toward compromise with a
final overhaul costing about $3 billion in the offing. If they
reach agreement, Hawkins and his followers will be outnumbered.
   Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
reportedly have agreed on major elements of a compromise,
bipartisan child care bill based on the Democrats' $2.5 billion Act
for Better Child Care Services.
   The bill would help low-income and, to a lesser extent,
middle-income families pay for child care and would require child
care homes and centers receiving federal money to conform to
minimum federal health, safety, training and staffing standards.
   The powerful National Education Association, along with the
Parent-Teachers Association, the American Civil Liberties Union and
other groups are mounting a campaign against the bill because
church-sponsored day care programs would be eligible for aid.
   But if the Senate ends up passing a popular bipartisan bill, the
House is expected to resist the lobbying pressure and follow suit.
   Closed-door negotiations over the air legislation have been
going on for weeks on both sides of the Capitol. Lawmakers are
divided over whether Congress can agree on the complicated package
in the remaining weeks of the session.
   Slated for House consideration this week is legislation to
authorize the Corps of Engineers to build about 20 new water
projects around the nation. The projects still need separate
appropriations legislation before they can get under way. The tight
money situation had caused Congress to vote no money for new
projects this year.

<HEAD>Barricades at Downtown Subway Stops Will Shut Out Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homeless activist Mitch Snyder said Sunday
that efforts by the city transit authority to keep homeless people
from finding shelter in subway station entrances are ``absolutely
revolting.''
   The city installed permanent barriers earlier in the day at the
entrances to several downtown subway stops to prevent entry to the
stations after the subways stop running at night.
   Homeless people had used the areas for shelter at night, but
city transit officials complained that they also littered the
stations and used them as a bathroom in the morning.
   ``This is intended to permit the authority to continue to
provide a clean and safe transit environment for riders and
employees,'' said Beverly Silverberg, spokeswoman for the
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
   Snyder said his group, the Community for Creative Non-Violence,
would meet to decide how to respond.
   ``I think it's absolutely revolting,'' especially with the
approach of cold weather, he said. ``What they've done is to drive
a fair number of people away from those cracks and corners where
they found a little bit of warmth.''
   Metro officials placed temporary grates at the entrance of one
downtown stop last year, to block entry after the subway station
closed at night. Homeless activists responded with protests and
sit-ins.
   The permanent barriers, electronic garage-type doors and
decorative bars, replaced the temporary structure at that station
and were installed at three other stations, officials said.

   The dream of creating room-temperature
superconductors is impossible unless scientists come up with
materials different from those they are now developing, new studies
suggest.
   Superconductors transmit electricity without resistance. Various
copper oxides are now the best superconductors under development
but have so far worked only if chilled to at least 234 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit.
   Commercially available superconductors must be kept much colder
with liquid helium, an expensive and cumbersome process.
   Researchers believe that if they can create room-temperature
superconductors, it may be feasible to build faster, smaller
computers; cheaper, super-efficient power transmission lines; 300
mph trains that float above tracks, and extraordinarily powerful
magnets to help produce electricity from nuclear fusion.
   ``It will not be possible with this class of (copper oxide)
materials to get room-temperature superconductivity,'' said
California Institute of Technology chemist William A. Goddard, who
will present his study here Monday during the American Chemical
Society's annual meeting, which started Sunday.
   When electricity is transmitted by normal conductors, some
electricity is converted to heat and lost because of resistance as
electrons move through the conducting material, just as swimmers
encounter resistance as they move through water.
   Electricity flows through superconductors without resistance,
like a swimmer who could take one stroke and glide through the
water forever.
   The theoretical study by Goddard and his graduate students was
based on laws of physics and previous experiments on superconductor
behavior. It produced a single mathematical equation to describe
superconductivity.
   The equation suggests somewhat warmer temperatures for
superconductivity, but predicts there is no way to fabricate copper
oxides to work as superconductors at temperatures higher than minus
54 F.
   In another study to be presented Monday, University of Georgia
chemist R. Bruce King produced a less detailed equation by
analyzing how atoms bind together in various compounds. His
equation suggests copper oxides won't be able to superconduct
electricity at temperatures above minus 135 F.
   Goddard's upper temperature limit probably is more accurate
because his equation is based on more information, said Thomas F.
George, natural sciences dean at the State University of New York
at Buffalo who will preside over the superconductivity session.
King agreed.
   Minus 54 F is much warmer than dry ice, which has a temperature
of minus 108 F. So Goddard's equation suggests scientists should be
able to develop copper oxide superconductors that can be
refrigerated with dry ice, which would make them more practical
than any existing superconductor.
   The equations should provide a mathematical basis for developing
a theory to explain why superconductivity happens, George said.
   ``It's like knowing the fastest we can go is the speed of
light,'' he said. ``You cannot develop a theory of relativity
without that limit.''
   King said both equations fail to provide any hint about what
materials could work as room-temperature superconductors.
   Scientists for years believed superconductivity was impossible
at temperatures above minus 418 F. They were proved wrong in 1986
when IBM scientists K. Alex Muller and J. Georg Bednorz in Zurich
discovered the superconducting properties of barium-laced lanthanum
copper oxide. They won the 1987 Nobel Prize in physics.
   ``The history of science if full of things that were said to be
impossible,'' King said. ``My gut feeling is that at some point in
time somebody is going to find a room-temperature superconductor.
But it's going to require some accidental discoveries. Known
principles and materials are not enough to allow the orderly design
of room-temperature superconductors.''

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ George Bush and Michael Dukakis,
after months of long-range exchanges, headed for a 90-minute debate
Sunday that promises an estimated prime-time television audience of
100 million people their first side-by-side look at the
presidential contenders.
   At stake was an edge in a campaign rated a tossup in most
national polls. With many voters undecided or wavering, the debate
starting at 8 p.m. EDT was viewed as a potentially pivotal event.
   Bush told reporters on the flight from Washington that he was
relaxed and determined to beat Dukakis. He said the debate was
``the second most important'' day of his political life after the
Nov. 8 presidential election itself.
   Dukakis told several hundred cheering supporters on his arrival
that the debate was long overdue. ``It's time we had a face-to-face
debate and this is going to be a good one,'' he said.
   Both campaigns took pains to portray their candidates as
underdogs.
   ``Dukakis is a good debater,'' Republican nominee Bush recently
told reporters. ``He is a professional debater and I'm not.''
   ``George Bush was the best debater in the Republican field,''
said Dayton Duncan, the spokesman for Democratic candidate Dukakis.
   It was the first of two debates between the candidates. The
second will take place in Los Angeles Oct. 13 or 14. Their running
mates _ Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and Republican Dan Quayle _ will
debate Oct. 5 in Omaha, Neb.
   Both candidates flew to North Carolina hours before the debate
to check the lighting and sound systems in Wait Chapel on the
campus of Wake Forest University and to browse through their
briefing books.
   Bush and Dukakis, whose campaign wrangling has turned
increasingly negative, were believed entering the debate with some
well-rehearsed, one-line barbs as well as more complex statements
of their positions on the issues.
   The debate moderator was Jim Lehrer, co-anchor of public
broadcasting's ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.''
   Three journalists _ John Mashek of the Atlanta Journal and
Constitution, ABC anchorman Peter Jennings and Orlando (Fla.)
Sentinel reporter Anne Groer _ were the questioners. The Republican
and Democratic parties sponsored the event, leaving the League of
Women Voters to oversee the Bentsen-Quayle showdown.
   The format, agreed to after weeks of discussions between the two
campaigns, allowed each candidate two minutes to answer a question
and one minute for rebuttal.
   At the end of the debate each candidate was allowed two minutes
for a closing statement.
   Other points over which the campaigns haggled were the makeup of
the panel, the height of the podiums and whether the candidates
would sit or stand.
   While the format allowed no opportunity for the candidates to
question each other, they were certain to find ways to raise
questions that have marked their stump attacks on each other.
   ``Where was George?'' has become a Democratic campaign slogan
referring to questions about the vice president's role _ or his
lack of one _ in the secret sale of arms to Iran and other
controversial Reagan administration actions.
   Dukakis also has repeatedly questioned Bush's relationship with
Panamanian military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has been
indicted in the United States on drug charges.
   Bush has portrayed the Massachusetts governor as an opponent of
most major military weapons systems and criticized his 1977 veto of
legislation that would have required his state's public school
teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
Bush also has criticized the Massachusetts program of weekend
furloughs for prison inmates.
   Both candidates watched tapes of their own and their opponents'
debate performances and engaged in mock debates with aides.
   Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman plauyed the role
of Dukakis in Bush's practice sessions. Washington attorney Robert
Barnett was the Bush stand-in for the Dukakis rehearsals.
   Dukakis did much of his debate preparation in a Boston hotel
suite that aides said was used by Bush during a visit to the city
months ago. Spokesman Mark Gearan said the Bush connection to the
suite was purely coincidental.
   In advance, both campaigns gave similar assessments of what they
hoped their candidate would accomplish.
   ``It's a chance to show the governor in command of the facts,
knowledgeable, to show that he's demonstrated he can be
president,'' said Gearan.
   ``It's important for him (Bush) to show that he's presidential,
substantive and in command,'' said Bush aide Rich Bond.
   National polls show the race is very close, with a large number
of voters indicating they are undecided or wavering in their
support for Bush or Dukakis.
   Wait Chapel, the debate site, seats about 2,400 people but the
real audience for the candidates' confrontation was the tens of
millions of TV viewers.
   Traditionally, the first of a series of presidential debates
draws the largest television audience.
   Estimates of the audience for the first debate in 1984 between
President Reagan and Democratic challenger Walter F. Mondale ranged
as high as 132 million. Voter turnout for the presidential election
was fewer than 100 million.
   ``It's the beginning of a new phase of the campaign,'' Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., said after a debate practice session with Dukakis.

<HEAD>Nixon Says Campaign is Caught in the Trivial and Inane</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Presidential Debate Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Nixon says the 1988 battle for the
presidency has been reduced to the ``trivial, superficial and
inane'' as George Bush and Michael Dukakis play to the limitations
of television and stress style over substance.
   The former president said in an essay published in Sunday's
editions of Newsday that serious speeches by Republican nominee
Bush and Democrat Dukakis on the economy and foreign policy have
received relatively little attention from the electronic medium.
   ``They have found that the surest way they could make the
evening news was to be silly, irresponsible or both,'' he said.
   ``Television commentators breathlessly inform us that Bush eats
pork rinds and that Dukakis has a 25-year-old snow blower.''
   Nixon also predicted that the debates between Bush and Dukakis,
starting with the matchup Sunday night in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
``will have the biggest impact on the election in the history of
presidential debates.''
   ``After what happened to me in the 1960 debates, I consider
myself an expert on what not to do,'' Nixon said.
   Political analysts have said that a nervous, haggard-looking
Nixon was outpointed by an assured, authoritative John F. Kennedy,
who gained in public opinion polls after the debates and squeaked
to a win in the general election.
   Nixon said the candidates should not get bogged down in facts
and must remember ``that how he looks is more important than what
he says.''
   ``It means being strong but not belligerent, confident but not
cocky,'' he wrote. ``Above all, a candidate should be presidential,
which means avoiding petty, cheap shots at his opponent.''
   He suggested that Bush and Dukakis avoid clever one-liners
because most of their audience already will have heard them before
and might think the candidates are being patronizing.
   ``Try to educate the voters, but don't talk down to them. Always
remember that people are smarter than you think they are, and many
of them are smarter than you are,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Gets Christmas Cards As Joking Reminder of Pearl Harbor Gaffe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Reporters gave Republican nominee
George Bush two dozen Christmas cards Sunday in a joking reminder
of his campaign blooper in misstating the date of the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor by three months.
   During the flight from Washington for his televised debate with
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis, the vice president dutifully
opened each card. Within two hours, he had written a reply to each
writer.
   ``To all at CBS, well almost all, Merry Christmas,'' Bush wrote
on one note, perhaps recalling his testy encounter with CBS-TV
anchorman Dan Rather earlier this year.
   ``It's a very tense kind of moment here in history. Do I want to
see this, what you're going to give me?'' Bush said as he walked
down the aisle of the plane in response to a message that the press
corps had something for him.
   He read each inscription. ``Read my lips: Merry Christmas,'' one
card said, paraphrasing his own line about no new taxes.
   As the scene was recorded by a network television camera, Bush
began making up inscriptions instead of reading what was written.
   ``You have been superb on the campaign trail,'' he claimed one
card read. His wife, Barbara, pretending to read another card,
said, ``We're all behind you.'' Mrs. Bush said that another one
read, ``Good luck in the debate. I know you're the best man.''
   Going by Bush's faulty calendar, Sunday, Sept. 25, would be
Christmas Day. He made his three-month mistake during a speech
before an American Legion convention when he said the anniversary
of Pearl Harbor was Sept. 7 instead of Dec. 7.
   Earlier in Washington, Bush had joked about the debate with
Dukakis and told reporters: ``Here's my key line: Who would have
thought we'd be debating Christmas night, Sept. 25.?''

   NASA postponed the start of the
countdown for space shuttle Discovery by eight hours Sunday because
of lagging preparations, but still aimed for a Thursday morning
liftoff.
   ``We're still on the timeline for launch on the 29th and that's
the plan,'' said launch director Bob Sieck.
   The countdown was rescheduled to begin at 8 a.m. EDT Monday for
the first manned American space flight since the Challenger blew up
over the Atlantic 32 months ago.
   The space agency had added 27 unprogrammed hours to the
countdown as insurance for last-minute problems, and Sieck said
eight hours of that time would be used in advance to complete the
work of replacing panels and work platforms.
   ``We don't want those people to have to do that under the gun
with the clock counting,'' he said. ``So we said, `take all the
time it takes and we'll delay the call to stations to accommodate
that.'''
   NASA had planned to start the countdown at midnight, but
``buttoning up'' the aft end of the spaceplane _ akin to closing
the hood on a car _ was delayed by a problem that had the potential
of postponing the launch for two days.
   Low voltage readings were found in an electrical circuit that
triggers the explosive charges used to separate the shuttle from
its fuel tank when the tank is empty. Eventually engineers
determined that the fault was in a ground circuit, which does not
affect the flight.
   The winged spaceplane rides aloft attached at three points to
the 154-foot-long external tank. At 8{ minutes into flight, just
before the shuttle reaches orbit, the explosive devices release the
tank and it breaks up in the atmosphere as it falls toward the
Indian Ocean.
   Discovery's launch date has been changed five times in the past
as new problems cropped up in getting ready for STS-26, the 26th
mission of the Space Transportation System.
   The Cape Canaveral area was bracing for an influx of visitors
comparable to the first flight of the space shuttle in 1981 when
more than a million crowded the roads outside the launch center.
   The renewed interest, too, was evident at the press site where
4,500 representatives of the news media applied for credentials. By
contrast, there were 500 journalists here when the Challenger
exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, 73 seconds after liftoff.
   When Discovery lifts off, with five veteran astronauts aboard,
it will be a far different vehicle than on its six previous
flights. The orbiter has had 210 changes and the solid fuel rockets
had 145.
   The booster rockets, which supply more than 70 percent of the
power to get the shuttle off the ground, were of the greatest
concern since it was the right-hand rocket that leaked flaming gas
and doomed the Challenger with its seven astronauts.
   The joints of the segmented boosters, which permitted the leak,
have been completely redesigned and have been tested in five
full-scale firings. But their only real test will come when the
Discovery lifts off its seaside pad _ the same one used for the
first time for Challenger.
   The accident grounded the manned space program for the
intervening 32 months and caused a complete rethinking in official
attitudes toward the shuttle. The Air Force, which was to have been
NASA's biggest customer _ taking one-third of shuttle space for
satellite deliveries _ has been building its own fleet of
expendable rockets.
   Because of the extensive redesign NASA is treating the flight as
it did the first. The ``hold time'' in the countdown sequence _ a
cushion to fix any problems that might crop up _ adds up to 40
hours, almost equalling work time.
   ``It's as safe as the designers could make it,'' Merlino told
reporters Sunday.
   Navy Capt. Frederick H. Hauck and his four-man crew of
astronauts will fly to the launch site from their Houston training
center Monday afternoon for last minute briefings and some practice
landing on the Kennedy runway in an aircraft that handles like a
shuttle.
   Discovery's cargo will be a $100 million communications
satellite that NASA needs for communications with future shuttles,
and 11 scientific experiments.

<HEAD>More Than 100 Million Africans Reported Undernourished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One African in four cannot afford to eat enough
for an active working life, and the number of hungry is rising, the
World Bank reported Sunday.
   Edward V. K. Jaycox, the bank's vice president for Africa,
released a report saying 103.7 million Africans are among the
``food insecure.''
   Communist Ethiopia, buffeted by wars and drought, has the
largest number: 14.7 million, nearly half its population. It is
followed by Nigeria with 13.7 million and Zaire with 12 million,
both with close ties to the United States.
   Chad, Somalia, Zambia and Mozambique have higher percentages,
but their population is smaller. Egypt is the best off among the 36
countries listed, with only 4 percent of its population, about 1.7
million, in the ``food insecure'' category.
   Other Egyptians get at least 2,200 calories a day, which Jaycox
says is the minimium needed for a working person.
   ``In the 1980s ... both the proportion and the total number of
Africans with deficient diets have climbed _ and will continue to
rise unless special action is taken,'' the report said.
   ``Barely a quarter of Africans lived in countries where food
consumption ... was increasing in the 1980s _ down considerably
from about two-thirds in the 1970s.''
   Production of food grains has been declining for two decades,
Jaycox told a news conference.
   In some places food may be scarce, but more often people just do
not have the money to buy it, he said. Ethiopia is the poorest
country on the World Bank's list, with average income estimated at
$120 a year, less than 35 cents a day.
   The report calls for action so that within five years, half to
two-thirds of the countries below the Sahara will have carried out
programs to cover a majority of the region's most needy.
   But Jaycox said it would be futile to propose anything so
specific as abolishing hunger ``by the year X.''
   ``We are not calling for a massive new injection of financial
resources here,'' he said.
   He said billions have been spent on aid for Africa, but the
programs have not worked well. He said many solutions do not need
new aid money.
   A major one is for African governments to pay higher prices to
African farmers. Jaycox said the bank completed negotiations with
Ethiopia that will give farmers more incentives and reduce state
confiscation of crops, which he said started before the present
government took power.
   But food security does not mean that every African country
should grow all its own food, he said.
   ``If a farmer in the Ivory Coast makes $8 a day growing cotton,
which nobody can eat, there's no point in his growing maize at $2 a
day,'' he said.
   Jaycox said some African governments pay their own farmers too
little, which discourages them from producing. The governments then
buy food from abroad and subsidize its sale in the towns.
   He said these policies are worse than the policies of wealthier
countries in America and Europe where governments sell their
surplus food cheap to benefit their own farmers at the expense of
the taxpayer.
   Jaycox said the African policies encourage people to shift to
rice and wheat, which are uneconomical to grow in Africa, away from
the sorghum and maize that their farmers traditionally have raised.

   Billy Carter, the former ``first brother''
and beer-drinking good ol' boy whose candor and business ventures
amused and sometimes embarrassed the Carter administration, died
Sunday of cancer. He was 51.
   The brother of former President Jimmy Carter suffered for a year
with pancreatic cancer _ the disease that killed his father and a
sister _ and lived longer than his doctors expected. He died three
days after leaving the hospital for his home in this southwest
Georgia hamlet.
   Carter ``died quietly and peacefully in his sleep ... with his
family at his bedside,'' according to a statement issued by the
Carter Presidential Center on behalf of the former president and
his family.
   ``He had struggled courageously with his illness, never losing
his sense of humor and always more concerned about those who loved
him than about himself,'' the family said.
   Billy Carter, who once defined himself as a beer-drinking good
ol' boy, was forced into the spotlight when his older brother
rocketed from their tiny hometown into the White House.
   He put his name on a brand of beer that flopped, got into hot
water with remarks denounced as racist or anti-Semitic, accepted
money from Libya and was forced to sell some properties to pay a
debt to the Internal Revenue Service.
   But underneath the mask of the court jester was a perceptive
man, an avid reader, a fighter who refused to go down quietly under
the pressures of alcoholism or cancer.
   Last April, Carter acknowledged he enjoyed being a part of the
national scene during his brother's presidency from 1977 to 1981.
   ``I've been asked, a thousand times, I guess, what I would do if
I had it to do over again,'' he added. ``And I said, `Probably the
same thing,' because if I had to do it over again I'd probably
screw up worse the second go-round.''
   He was born William Alton Carter III, the youngest of four
children. He was a child with a stutter who did badly in school
while his siblings shone.
   Billy was 16 when his father died in 1953 and Jimmy, a Navy
officer 13 years his senior, moved back home to Plains to take over
the family's peanut business. Billy chafed under his brother's
stewardship and soon married his high school sweetheart, Sybil, and
joined the Marines.
   Carter later drove a truck for the family warehouse, then spent
two years at Emory University in Atlanta before he was forced out
because of poor grades and for turning in a term paper written by
someone else.
   He returned to Plains in 1964, where he gradually assumed
control of the peanut business, which grew into a $5 million a year
operation under his stewardship. The business was placed in trust
while his brother was president.
   ``It changed my lifestyle completely,'' he said later. ``I was
40 years old and went from one extreme to the other just
overnight.''
   During his brother's presidency, he made no effort to smooth out
his image. He cultivated a redneck personality and was known for a
quick and often profane wit.
   At a Canadian bellyflop championship, he jumped into the pool
with a beer in his hand and a rose between his teeth. He judged a
pizza distributor's beauty contest. He put his signature on the
label of ``Billy'' beer, but later joked that one reasonshe gave up
drinking was that the beer was so bad.
   ``I don't know how to describe the appeal, but I think people
can't believe a president's brother can be like I am,'' he told
Penthouse magazine.
   Finally, his remarks went too far. When a black California
politician named Carter Gilmore joked that they might be related,
Billy responded, ``I hate to say this, but we've all left a nigger
in the woodpile somewhere.'' At a dinner honoring Atlanta Braves
pitcher Phil Niekro, Billy called him a ``bastardized Jew'' and ``a
Polack.''
   Jimmy Carter stood gamely by his brother, refusing to muzzle
him, joking about Billy's contributions to the beer industry and
assuring reporters that Billy was a competent, capable man.
   But the brothers were forced to put some distance between them
in 1979, after Billy Carter visited Libya and served as host for a
return visit by Libyan officials, calling the Libyans ``the best
friends I've got in the world right now.'' He also disclosed that
he had accepted $220,000 from the Libyans to help pay bills and
various expenses.
   In all, the Carter presidency and the years immediately after
were tough on the president's brother.
   In 1979, a federal grand jury investigated whether loans to the
family peanut warehouse were diverted to the presidential campaign,
allegations Carter denied. He spent seven weeks in an alcohol
rehabilitation program that year.
   In 1981, to help pay a $105,000 debt to the IRS, he sold his
Plains home and the little gas station where he used to hold court
for reporters. He moved to Alabama, worked as a mobile home
salesman, and returned to Plains in 1986.
   In September 1987, doctors told him he had inoperable cancer of
the pancreas, which had killed his father, James Earl Carter, in
1953 and his sister, Ruth Carter Stapleton, an evangelist, in 1983.
   He underwent an experimental program at Emory University
Hospital, and in May checked into the National Cancer Institute in
Bethesda, Md., for what he said might be his ``last chance _ the
only one left. Except prayer, and I'm trying that too.''
   One of Carter's last public appearances came in July when he
attended the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   A funeral service will be held Monday in Plains, where his
mother, ``Miss Lillian'' Carter, and his father are buried.
   In addition to his wife and brother, Carter is survived by six
children, ages 11 to 31, and sister Gloria Carter Spann.

   Billy Carter was never shy about sharing his
opinions, and they were often colorful and profane. Here is a
sampling:
   _On his family: ``I got a mother who went into the Peace Corps
at the age of 68, I got a sister who's a Holy Roller preacher, I
got another sister who rides motorcycles and wears helmets, I got a
brother who thinks he's going to be president of the United States.
I'm the only sane one in the family.''
   _On sleeping in the White House: ``I didn't like it 'cause I got
lost. I couldn't find the bathroom and I'd had 20 beers before I
went to bed.''
   _On the press: ``I don't believe a damned thing I read. The main
thing that turns me off about the political process is the press.
About 90 percent of you are reporters because you don't have enough
sense to be anything else.''
   _On his own political preferences: ``I'm a (George) Wallace
Democrat who voted for Jimmy Carter.''
   _On his relationship with his brother: ``I don't tell him how to
be president and he doesn't tell me what to do.''
   _On his alcoholism: ``The toughest part was when I made up my
mind never to drink again _ God knows I gave up one of my best
friends. ... I've found out water can be drunk straight.''
   _On the difference between a redneck and a good ol' boy: ``A
good ol' boy ... is someone that rides around in a pickup truck _
which I do _ drinks beer and puts 'em in a litter bag. A redneck's
one what rides around in a truck and drinks beer and throws 'em out
the window.''
   _On women's rights: ``I think women have rights. They ought to
have the right to be a good cook and good housekeeper, look after
the baby.''
   _On himself: ``I'm not the Carter that doesn't tell a lie.''

<HEAD>Soul Singer Free On Bond After Chase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soul singer James Brown faces 11 charges
including assault and battery with intent to kill after leading
police on a chase that began near Augusta, ran into South Carolina
and back into Georgia.
   The 55-year-old Brown, known to his fans as ``The Godfather of
Soul,'' was free Sunday after posting a total of $25,298 in bonds
in the two states.
   The half-hour chase ended after police shot out the tires on
Brown's pickup truck. He drove six miles on wheel rims before
winding up in a ditch, police said.
   The incident began when Brown allegedly walked into an insurance
seminar Saturday armed with a shotgun and a pistol, ordered
everyone to leave the room and ``escorted'' some women outside to
lock the restrooms.
   Brown was mumbling incoherently through a microphone and
``wanted to know who was using his restrooms,'' a deputy said.
Brown has an office in the building.
   Brown's wife, Adrienne, said the singer is on medication for jaw
surgery. ``He's in pain. ... He's not in his right mind,'' she said.
   Brown was arrested in Georgia, waived extradition and was taken
to the Aiken County, S.C., Detention Center, where he was released
Saturday night after posting bond.
   Police said North Augusta, S.C., police officers shot out the
front tires of Brown's red and white pickup truck when he tried to
run over them as they were setting up a roadblock.
   ``He was running on two steel rims in the front. He drove about
six miles like that,'' said Sgt. J.W. Wylds of the Augusta Police
Department. Brown's vehicle eventually went into a ditch, said
Augusta Police Lt. E.C. Wilburn.
   ``The subject did resist (arrest). ... Minimum force was used,''
Wilburn said.
   A shotgun was recovered, he said.
   Brown was charged in South Carolina with two counts of assault
and battery with intent to kill, failure to stop for blue lights
and sirens and driving under the influence, according to a jail
spokesman.
   He was charged in Georgia's Richmond County with weapons,
assault and traffic charges. Bail there _ separate from his $21,268
bail across the river _ was set at $4,030.
   A Richmond County Jail spokesman said Brown was carrying more
than $7,000 in cash, part of which paid his bail there.
   ``A million and a half dollars down the drain!'' William Glenn,
vice president of James Brown Enterprises, said, referring to a
European tour Brown was to begin Oct. 5.
   On July 21, Brown was sentenced to 2{ years of suspended jail
time, fined $1,200 and placed on probation until he performs a
benefit concert after pleading no contest to possession of the drug
PCP and guilty to a charge of resisting arrest and a weapons charge.
   Those charges stem from a May 18 incident in which his wife
claimed Brown beat her.
   Brown also was arrested on assault charges after his wife
claimed on Easter Sunday that he shot at her and beat her. She
since has refused to testify.

Inflation Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Finance leaders of industrialized nations
expressed satisfaction Sunday over prospects for non-inflationary
world economic growth, but Brazil's finance minister contended that
developing nations still were not sharing in the expansion.
   ``Despite alarms and jitters, the world economy has performed
well over the past year,'' Nigel Lawson, British chancellor of the
exchequer, told finance chiefs at the annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   The industrialized nations, he said, ``have a good opportunity''
to extend their healthy growth pace without a fresh spurt in
inflation.
   West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg agreed with
Lawson's sentiments during closed-door discussions with 22 finance
ministers who make up the interim committee of the International
Monetary Fund.
   ``While growth in the industrial countries exceeds earlier
expectations, inflationary pressures have been contained,''
Stoltenberg said.
   The International Monetary Fund has predicted the world economy
would expand at a 3.8 percent pace this year, slipping to 3.1
percent next year.
   But Lawson and Stoltenberg both urged the United States to pare
its red-ink spending further.
   ``The absorption by the United States government, for a further
long period, of a sizable share of the world's net savings would
not be in anyone's interest,'' said Lawson.
   ``So we look to the new U.S. administration to take early and
effective action to reduce its budget deficit still further.''
   Many analysts contend the United States must to keep its
interest rates higher in order to attract money to finance the
deficit. Higher interest rates generally are seen as a drag on
economic growth.
   The U.S. delegation to the conference did not release the
remarks to the group by newly-installed Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady. But non-U.S. sources, who demanded anonymity, quoted Brady
as assuring his financial counterparts that the United States
placed the ``highest priority'' on efforts to reduce its deficit
spending.
   Brady was making his first appearance at the international
talks, which began last Thursday and will run through Sept. 29. The
IMF and its sister agency, the World Bank, count 151 nations as
members.
   Despite the upbeat remarks from industrialized nations, finance
officials of the poorer nations worried they were being left out of
the gains.
   ``Developing countries cannot share the relative optimism ...
for the developed world,'' said Brazil's finance minister, Mailson
Ferreira da Nobrega. ``If conditions do not change, no basic
improvement is expected this year for the developing countries.''
   Da Nobrega said the per capita income of Latin American and
Caribbean nations was expected to tumble 0.6 percent this year.
``It is clear growth in industrial countries does not trickle down
to developing countries' economies,'' da Nobrega said.
   He urged the finance ministers to ``stop thinking that only the
performance of developed countries economies can have a major
impact on the recovery of the world economy.''
   Instead, da Nobrega said, the officials should directly attack
developing countries' economic woes, with fresh money for poorer
nations, reduced foreign debt payments and removal of trade
barriers.
   Da Nobrega also cautioned the industrialized countries not to
overreact to inflation fears and slow their economic growth.
   But France's Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy cautioned that
the international economic recovery ``remains fragile.'' He said
there were inflationary tendencies because of the cash injected in
financial markets by central bankers after last October's stock
market crash.
   Lawson said industrialized nations were prepared to tighten
monetary policy and bump up interest rates to curb inflation, but
contended that ``some of the danger signs of a potential resurgence
of inflation ... have receded.''
   Japan's central bank governor, Satoshi Sumita, said there was no
danger of an inflationary surge in Japan. Prices have remained
stable, he said, because of weak oil prices and imports of
lower-priced manufactured goods from other Asian countries.
   Earlier, Brady, Stoltenberg, Sumita, Lawson, Beregovoy and
finance officials from five other leading industrial nations met
and issued a statement calling for efforts to ``keep inflation
under firm control.''
   The ministers, it said, predicted ``good prospects'' for
continued economic expansion in the near future.

<HEAD>Gunter, MacKay In Heated Democratic Senate Race in Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The race for the Democratic nomination to succeed
retiring U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles has become a heated, personal
battle that some party leaders worry will send a limping candidate
into the general election.
   State Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter, head of the powerful
regulatory department since 1976, and third-term U.S. Rep. Kenneth
``Buddy'' MacKay emerged at the top of a six-candidate primary
field Sept. 6, and stepped up criticism of each other immediately
as they headed to an Oct. 4 runoff.
   Gunter has cited MacKay votes in Congress to charge he has
betrayed Israel, retirees and veterans, appealing to three
important Florida constituencies, and said MacKay is ``out of step
with Floridians.''
   MacKay has questioned Gunter's integrity for accepting campaign
contributions from the insurance industry he regulates, including
from two companies that later collapsed. Gunter called MacKay
hypocritical for taking political action committee money.
   MacKay's first television commercial of the runoff campaign
quotes an Orlando Sentinel editorial endorsement of MacKay
referring to Gunter's ``severe ethical deficiency'' and calls
himself the candidate of ``real integrity.''
   Gunter's first commercial shows a 79-year-old North Miami widow
and refers to a 1985 deficit-reduction package vote in which MacKay
supported freezing the Social Security cost-of-living-adjustment.
   ``Some people tried to take $228 from Ida Lawn, and it wasn't
muggers,'' the commercial says. ``It was some Washington
politicians who voted to cut Social Security. Buddy MacKay was one
of those politicians.''
   Both Democrats come from north-central Florida, are nearly the
same age _ Gunter is 54, MacKay 55 _ and both may be looking at
their last shot at the Senate.
   The winner will face well-funded Republican nominee Rep. Connie
Mack III.
   ``I am sure Connie is having a ball and cheering the two
campaigns on,'' said Charles Whitehead, state Democratic Party
chairman. ``I'm always disappointed when anything happens to help
the Republican nominee.''
   Mark Mills, campaign press secretary to Mack, noted that the
Republican nominee, after a lopsided primary victory over former
U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, has stayed on television with
commercials promoting his positions.
   ``We've had the opportunity to get our message out and solidify
our support while the two Democrats are engaged in a bitter and
very divisive runoff,'' Mills said. ``I think what everybody
thought this runoff was going to be is coming true _ the winner is
going to be battered, bruised, and broken.''
   Mack, a former Cape Coral bank president and grandson of his
namesake, the Baseball Hall of Fame manager, acknowledges the
bitter runoff is a boost for him.
   Mack has raised some $3.2 million and also has $859,000 from the
national Republican Senatorial Committee, eyeing Florida as one of
its best chances to pick up Senate seats. Former two-term
Democratic Gov. Bob Graham unseated Republican Sen. Paula Hawkins
in 1986.
   Chiles, 58, a Democrat who is Senate Budget Committee chairman,
in December cited work burnout and displeasure with the high cost
of campaigns in announcing his decision not to seek re-election to
a fourth term.
   Whitehead, as party chairman, has twice seen wounded nominees
fall, and MacKay and Gunter had a hand in one of those losses. The
Democrats have a 3-2 lead in statewide registration, but Floridians
in recent years have been ticket-splitters and Vice President
George Bush is favored to carry the state for the Republicans for
the eighth time in the last 10 presidential elections.
   Gunter lost in 1980 to Mrs. Hawkins for the Senate after a
heated primary race involving MacKay and incumbent Richard Stone.
And gubernatorial nominee Steve Pajcic lost to Republican Bob
Martinez in 1986 after a divisive runoff.

<TEXT>
   Texans favor Republican George Bush for
president by 50.6 percent to 40.7 percent over Democrat Michael
Dukakis, with about 8.7 percent of voters undecided, according to a
public opinion poll released Sunday.
   The poll, conducted for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and station
WFAA-TV in Dallas on Sept. 17-20, surveyed the preferences of 1,443
likely voters. The margin of error was 2.6 percent.
   Bush campaign spokesman Reggie Bashur said the poll results were
``very good news.'' He added that ``the message is getting out loud
and clear throughout Texas that George Bush is a conservative Texan
and Michael Dukakis is a liberal politician from Massachusetts.''
   Tom Cosgrove, the Texas campaign manager for Dukakis, said he
believed the campaign momentum would return to the Democrats after
the Bush-Dukakis debate Sunday night in Winston-Salem, N.C., ``when
the American people get to see George Bush without his handlers.''
   Frank Newport, the Houston pollster who conducted the survey,
said Texas voters aren't being influenced in their presidential
choice by the vice presidential candidates, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas and Republican Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   ``It's the top of the ticket that is driving the outcome,''
Newport said. ``Bentsen is not helping Dukakis ... and Quayle is
not a significant factor.''
   Texas is considered a major campaign battleground because of its
29 electoral votes.

<HEAD>C-Ration and Mess Hall No Longer Part of Modern Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>

   There's no such thing as a mess hall in
today's military, it's now an enlisted dining facility. The
C-ration is also gone, replaced by the less lyrical MRE, short for
meal ready to eat.
   These changes, and others, are constantly being orchestrated by
the U.S. Army's Research and Development Laboratories, assigned to
develop food for all the armed forces among other tasks.
   One of the latest items for GI menus is an all-natural bread
with a shelf life of three years. And Tabasco sauce is now a
required condiment for every fighting man and woman.
   Army scientists and engineers develop food, clothing, shelter
and airdrop equipment in the labs that are spread out on the
78-acre base about 20 miles south of Boston. But much attention is
paid to planning the continually evolving menus, or what scientists
call ``future feeding concepts.''
   Civilians might call most of the food ``take-out.'' The majority
is designed for soldiers in combat and must last for three years.
   ``The conception of how war needs to be fought changes, and when
the military rethinks how it's going to fight, we need to rethink
food,'' said Phil Brandler, acting director of food engineering at
the base.
   MREs replaced the well-known C-rations in 1981. The heavier
canned items that were part of the lore of World War II and the
Korean and Vietnam wars were dropped in favor of a lightweight
``meal in a pouch,'' much of which can be reconstituted in the
field.
   ``The modern battlefield is more mobile, it makes (the men)
harder to find and get to, and they go off for days at a time,''
said Brandler. ``They have to be provided with foodstuffs of low
volume that can be carried around for awhile.''
   Army chefs are also mindful that soldiers ought to like what
they eat, or at least tolerate it.
   ``Tastes change,'' said Brandler. ``Food that we developed for
the Korean and Vietnam war no longer is always acceptable.''
   Part of that, according to Brandler, is that the ethnic makeup
of the Army has changed over the years.
   ``We have a higher percentage of Vietnamese and Orientals,'' he
said. ``Our troops want spicier foods.'' Hence the tiny bottles of
Tabasco sauce that surface in each MRE.
   ``Loss of acceptance'' is the term given food items scorned by
soldiers in periodic taste tests, according to Army food specialist
Sue Gagner.
   Among the food that's been dropped are lima beans, ham and
chicken loaf, three-bean salad and fruitcake. Beef stew is on the
way out. After soldiers complained that omelettes were too
``dense,'' they were promptly ``reformulated.''
   The first of Army rations was established by Congressional
resolution on Nov. 4, 1775.
   Those daily rations consisted of either beef, pork or salt fish,
accompanied by bread or flour, three pints of peas or beans, one
pint of milk, one pint of Indian meal, one quart of spruce beer and
a portion of molasses.
   These days, along with one of 12 different entrees such as
chicken a la king or tuna with noodles, soldiers are allotted
crackers with cheese spread, freeze-dried fruit, candy, cookies or
cake, instant coffee or tea and powders that turn into
fruit-flavored drinks.
   Most popular foods in the MREs are spaghetti and meatballs, the
dried strawberries (just add water) and bags of brand-name candy.
   The food is surprisingly palatable and can be heated up in
minutes.
   It's relative tastiness is all the more surprising given the
ambitious shelf life requirements for combat food. Because food
must be warehoused for long periods and be available for immediate
shipment to hot spots, the Army has developed the bread that still
tastes pretty good after a few years.
   The bread is new and the result of recent technology developed
at the base. No preservatives or chemicals are used; instead, it is
baked with a combination of ingredients designed to slow the growth
of microbes.
   You may not find it served at Maxim's any time soon, but the
bread has enjoyed ``good acceptance'' among soldiers. And that
suits its creators just fine.
   Even after three years, according to Gerald Schulz, associate
director of food engineering, ``they would not be repulsed by it.''

<HEAD>Former VA Chief Max Cleland Fighting New Kind Of War At Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DICK PETTYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Veterans Administration chief Max Cleland
overcame Vietnam War wounds to launch a successful political
career. Now he's struggling to save it from a new kind of hostile
fire: distribution of a tape-recorded, sexually explicit
conversation with a woman.
   Cleland, 46, headed the VA under President Carter from 1977
through 1980. He is now Georgia's secretary of state and is
considered a possible Democratic candidate for governor in 1990.
   Two weeks ago, he went public with what until then had been a
widely repeated rumor in political circles.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Cleland said a
secretly made tape of a private conversation was being circulated
by political adversaries to ``discredit me and the good record I've
been able to put together.''
   Cleland, who is not married, said the conversation was ``with an
old girlfriend a year or two ago, made from my own home on my
personal, private, unlisted phone number. The girl was single ...
and it was a private conversation between us.''
   The woman has never been identified, and Cleland has refused to
say who he believes to be involved in the distribution of the tape.
   But there were these other developments the day following
Cleland's announcement:
   _Atlanta attorney Guy Davis, who was the GOP gubernatorial
nominee in 1986, told reporters he represents the woman in the
conversation and had a copy of the tape. However, he insisted that
Democrats were behind the distribution of it. Specifically, he
charged that the politically powerful House speaker, Tom Murphy,
sent copies of the tape to Democratic county chairmen. Murphy
called Davis ``a total liar.''
   _Lamar Weaver, an insurance man in suburban Cobb County who
called himself a friend of the woman, told reporters he encouraged
her to tape conversations with Cleland because he felt she was
being abused. Weaver said he gave copies of the tape to four
people, Murphy among them.
   There have been no new revelations since then.
   Cleland and his top advisers, now beginning to assess the
damage, said it appears to have been negligible.
   ``We haven't received a negative piece of mail or phone call _
not even anonymously,'' said Bill Crane, Cleland's press secretary.
``After this story broke, Max had 150 to 160 telephone messages
waiting for him on his desk, all saying, `We're with you; you've
been smeared.'''
   For the most part, editorial writers and columnists also have
rushed to Cleland's defense, among them Tom Teepen, editorial page
editor of The Atlanta Constitution.
   Teepen declared: ``The low level of Georgia's state politics is
gouged to new depths by the sickening, clandestine distribution of
... (the) tape.'' On Thursday, the Constitution devoted nearly half
a page to letters from readers agreeing with Teepen.
   Crane said early indications are that the incident has not
affected Cleland's fund-raising ability or political standing in
Georgia and said Cleland still intends to make a decision about
future plans sometime after the November general election.
   He also said Cleland and his advisers have had no second
thoughts about going public with the issue.
   ``If we hadn't dealt with it, the rumors _ unsubstantiated
rumors of all shapes and sizes _ would've continued to expand and
choke us,'' he said.
   Cleland, who lost both legs and an arm in a grenade blast in
Vietnam, turned his attention to politics after recovering from the
injuries. He served in the Georgia Senate from 1970 through 1974
while Carter was governor, then became Carter's VA administrator in
Washington.
   He was elected secretary of state in 1982 and re-elected in 1986.

<HEAD>Anti-Aquino Rebels Celebrate Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fireworks lit up the sky and gunfire
and explosions were heard across the capital Sunday in what was
called a display of support for rebels who tried to topple
President Corazon Aquino last year.
   Police said one man was killed and another captured after three
gunmen in a jeep fired on a police car in suburban Quezon City
during the fireworks display.
   Meanwhile, communist guerrillas killed a woman and her two sons,
and government soldiers gunned down three rebels in separate
incidents over the weekend, the news agency and the military said.
   Sgt. Manny Siocon said the attack in Quezon apparently was
linked to the fireworks display. He said the third assailant
escaped and police recovered a rifle, flares and bundles of
fireworks from the gunmen's vehicle.
   Police and residents said the fireworks began about 8:30 p.m. at
military camps in the Manila area and lasted up to 15 minutes.
   A member of the Presidential Security Group told The Associated
Press the fireworks explosions could also be heard near the
presidential palace.
   Columnist Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc wrote in the pro-government
Philippine Daily Inquirer Sunday that a group called the
Revolutionary Association for the People's Freedom would explode
fireworks across the nation to signal ``the birthing of a Filipino
movement to free the nation now mired in greed and looting.''
   There were no reports of displays elsewhere in the country, but
Mrs. Magsanoc said pamphlets published by the previously unknown
group called for ``dismantling of the transitional exploitative
government,'' a reference to the Aquino administration. Police said
they accept the journalist's explanation, but refused further
comment.
   She said the fireworks would honor the leaders of a bloody Aug.
28, 1987, coup attempt, in which renegade soldiers led by former
Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan tried to topple the Aquino
government. At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were
wounded in the coup attempt.
   Honasan was captured in December but escaped in April from a
prison ship in Manila Bay and remains at large.
   He played a key role in the February 1986 military revolt that
toppled President Ferdinand Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino to
power.
   But Honasan became disillusioned with Mrs. Aquino for her
alleged failure to crush the 19-year Communist insurgency and
restore an honest, democratic administration.
   In Capiz on Panay island about 200 miles south of Manila,
guerrillas Saturday strafed the house of Boday Hulido, 30, killing
her and her two sons, the Philippines News Agency said. It said the
rebels may have been looking for Hulido's husband, who had just
been recruited into a new militia force.
   In Bukidnon province, about 550 miles southeast of Manila,
soldiers killed three rebels in a clash outside Magsaysay village
early Sunday, the military said.
   Lt. Col. Antonio Zaldua said the soldiers were sent to the
village after receiving reports that rebels were allegedly asking
residents for money.
   The soldiers recovered firearms, medicines, foodstuff and a
radio transmitter from the scene of the firefight, the official
said. No government casualties were reported.
   In another incident, a grenade found by a 12-year-old boy
exploded after he brought it home, killing him, his two brothers
and a friend, the news agency reported.
   Friday's grenade blast in the village of Udok on Panay island
killed Gerry Nadong, 9; Angelo Nadong, 12; and Herandi Nadong, 23.
Their friend, Hernani Fernando, age unknown, died in a hospital,
the report said. Six other people were injured.
   It said the boy found the grenade near his village and quoted
Col. Jorge Vallejera as saying the grenade may have been dropped
accidentally by military planes that had attacked a communist New
People's Army camp in the area.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Singing Creole hymns and praying
for their nation, thousands of people gathered at a Roman Catholic
church Sunday to mourn a horrifying church massacre and celebrate
the military uprising it spawned.
   The crowd of 3,000 packed an auditorium at St. Gerard Church and
spilled out into an outdoor courtyard for the service that went
from solemn to celebratory.
   The Rev. Antonio Sele, in an emotionally charged sermon, praised
the soldiers' rebellion that toppled the military regime of Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy.
   ``For that great victory of Sept. 17, we thank you, Lord,'' Sele
said.
   He referred to the rank-and-file soldiers who led the coup as
``our soldiers'' and denounced the slaughter that left 13 people
dead and 77 wounded during a Sept. 11 Mass at St. Jean Bosco
Church, which was set on fire.
   After Sunday's special Mass, about 1,500 people _ including 150
survivors of the massacre _ marched more than seven miles in a
two-line procession to a church-run school in the suburb of
Petionville, where they were greeted by St. Jean Bosco's popular
priest, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
   Aristide, who had not appeared in public since escaping the
massacre, emerged from the school accompanied by several priests,
nuns and church laymen. The throng erupted in cheers. Two women
shouted: ``He's alive, he's alive.''
   Aristide waved and stood before the crowd for about 15 minutes.
   ``God is with us. Don't lose courage. The cleaning up has just
begun,'' he said in a barely audible voice.
   On Sept. 11 , thugs wielding guns, machetes, clubs and pikes
stormed the church in a Port-au-Prince slum, randomly killing and
wounding parishioners.
   Soldiers of the army's Presidential Guard cited the massacre as
a key reason for overthrowing the Namphy and installing a new
military government under Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril. Namphy was sent
into exile in the Dominican Republic.
   The church service on Sunday at St. Gerard, in the capital's
Carrefour Fueilles, drew about 2,000 people in the auditorium and
about 1,000 more in the courtyard.
   During the service at St. Gerard, in the capital's Carrefour
Fueilles district, parishioners sang Creole hymns written
especially for the occasion. ``Haiti, Lord Jesus, we beg of you to
make the country new again. We are fed up with humiliations,'' they
sang.
   The service began solemnly but exploded into euphoric singing,
clapping and chanting. One priest danced with an old woman to the
rhythm of conga drums and an electric guitar.
   A chair draped with embroidered vestments stood at the foot of
the altar, symbolizing Aristide, who was saved from the massacre by
parishioners who shielded him with their bodies.
   ``Jean-Bertrand Aristide is the one chosen by God for Haiti to
denounce injustice, to show us the truth,'' Sele said.
   Aristide, one of the most popular figures in Haiti, had
repeatedly accused the Namphy regime of condoning atrocities and of
brutal repression.
   Some opposition figures, however, have expressed skepticism
about Avril's willingness to bring democracy to Haiti, which has
not had free elections in 31 years. Avril was an adviser during the
rule of Jean-Claude Duvalier, the son of former dictator Francois
Duvalier.
   The younger Duvalier fled into exile on Feb. 7, 1986, ending the
Duvalier family's 29-year reign. Avril was the army's top
administrative officer under Namphy, who took power after
Duvalier's ouster.
   In a declaration Sunday, Haiti's 10 Catholic bishops backed the
coup's human-rights objectives.
   But they said it was worthwhile only if the government disarms
the dreaded Tonton Macoutes, Duvalier family's private militia, and
excludes from the civil service all those who ``actively cooperated
in perpetuating the 29-year dictatorship.
   ``We insist on this justice to break the hellish circle of hate
and vengeance,'' said the statement, read over the Roman Catholic
radio station Radio Soleil.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Locked in Dead Heat in New Jersey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael
Dukakis are locked in a virtual dead heat in New Jersey, according
to a statewide poll released Sunday.
   The survey of 505 probable voters found the Republican
presidential nominee leading Dukakis 47-44 percent, a margin
statistically negated by the poll's margin of error of 4.5 percent.
   The Star-Ledger-Eagleton poll was conducted Sept. 16-22 in a
state considered a key battleground in November. New Jersey has 16
electoral votes.
   A similar statewide poll done in May gave Democratic nominee
Dukakis a 14-point lead. Bush held a 10-point advantage in a survey
conducted in late August following the Republican National
Convention.

<HEAD>Parma Reports Little Response To Open Housing Advertising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE McDONALD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cleveland's largest suburb is running ads
telling minorities they are welcome in the nearly all-white
community, but officials say the court-ordered campaign is getting
a lukewarm response.
   Parma launched the advertising campaign in January on orders
from a judge who ruled the middle-class suburb of 92,000 illegally
tried to keep minorities out.
   The public relations effort has included a booklet for
prospective residents, a three-month radio campaign and year-long
advertisements in three local newspapers, including The Call and
Post, a black-oriented weekly.
   The ads proclaim Parma ``welcomes people of all races, religions
and national origins.'' and is an ``interracial community offering
the advantages of a comfortable and stable suburban lifestyle.''
   Parma has spent about $70,000 on the campaign and signed a
$12,000 contract with The Cuyahoga Plan, a countywide fair housing
organization, to answer calls responding to the advertising.
   But only 57 calls have come in since the agency began handling
the inquiries in March, said Anda Cooke, the Cuyahoga Plan's
director of housing information.
   ``A lot of money is put into ads, and to get just 57 calls is
disappointing,'' she said.
   The campaign is one of the remedies ordered by U.S. District
Judge Frank J. Battisti in 1980. He ruled that Parma officials
violated the Fair Housing Act, which forbids discrimination in
housing on the basis of race.
   The Justice Department filed suit after Parma rejected plans for
a federally subsidized apartment building for the elderly. City
officials argued the plans did meet building codes, but Battisti
agreed with the Justice Department that there was a pattern of
opposition to public and low-income housing in Parma.
   The 1980 census showed Parma's population included 1.9 percent
racial minorities overall and 0.4 percent blacks. Cleveland's
573,822 residents in 1980 included 46.5 percent racial minorities
and 43.8 percent blacks.
   Among other things, Battisti told Parma to establish a
fair-housing committee, participate in federally subsidized housing
programs and advertise the availability of such housing.
   The city now has 60 units of public housing and also
participates in a federal rent-subsidy program for low-income
residents.
   Robert S. Soltis, a lawyer who represented the city, said Parma
has ``complied with everything the court wanted and then some. The
order only required newspaper ads. We ran radio ads as well, and of
course these things are expensive.''
   However, Avery S. Friedman, a fair housing lawyer who was
appointed special adviser in the case, is critical of Parma's
advertising campaign, which he said doesn't include information
about the remedial order or open-housing opportunities.
   ``They came out with their booklet about six months ago, saying
what a wonderful thing it was to live in Parma,'' Friedman said.
``This wasn't just advertising. It was intended to portray to
minorities that it was fair housing.''
   Christopher Boyko, Parma's law director, said no amount of
advertising will change the racial mix of the population moving to
Parma, which was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country
during the 1960's.
   ``There was never any need to advertise. People came to Parma in
natural migrating patterns, and that is just the way it
developed,'' said Boyko.
   ``Our contention is that if we do everything we can to make
Parma an open community, then we can't drag people into our city.''

<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   It's Christmas Eve. The snow is falling. Bing
Crosby is crooning ``I'll Be Home for Christmas.'' The kids are
tucked snugly into bed. There's talk of Santa Claus and Christmas
presents.
   Then the young husband confesses that he has taken a contract
out on his wife, and the hired killer will be arriving any minute.
   ``Holidays can be tough sometimes,'' sympathizes a character in
``Reckless,'' a dark, dizzy and often dangerous black comedy by
Craig Lucas that opened Sunday, courtesy of off-Broadway's Circle
Repertory Company.
   Its heroine, Rachel, doesn't wait for explanations from her
repentant hubby. Dressed in a bathrobe and slippers, she flees out
the bedroom window and into the snowy night. Her escape and
subsequent education about life are the nightmarish stories of
``Reckless,'' a quirky, often funny fantasy that grows grimmer as
it becomes more absurd.
   During her journey, Rachel turns into a female Candide
transported through a dream-like, cloud-filled setting designed by
Loy Arcenas. This suburban housewife is an eternal optimist, no
matter how badly she is battered by people and events during her
convoluted travels.
   At the beginning of her bizarre adventure, this orphan of the
storm gets picked up at a local gas station by Lloyd, who brings
her home to his wife, Pooty, a quadriplegic and deaf mute.
   The trio ends up on a TV game show called ``Your Mother or Your
Wife?'' where Lloyd wants to win money so he can pay child support
to a long-forgotten first wife.
   Rachel gets a job working as a clerk for Hands Across the Sea, a
vaguely humanitarian organization, and incurs the jealousy of her
neurotic supervisor. Before she finally reaches the end of her
travels, Rachel witnesses several murders and has visited various
psychiatrists, including one who practices primal scream therapy.
By the final scene, she becomes a psychiatrist herself, and ends up
counseling her own son.
   In terms of plot, it makes for a breathless evening, one that is
astonishing in its inventiveness in bringing long-lost characters
back together after extended absences.
   The comedy threatens to run out of steam several times during
the play. The game show spoof is not as ferocious or as funny as it
could be, but then it would be hard to top some of the real-life
examples already on television.
   In Act 2, the laughs eventually give way to a unsettling black
humor as Rachel becomes more aware of the crazy situation she has
gotten herself into. The character and the play become more somber
as they attempt to define what Rachel has done with her life since
leaving her husband.
   Rachel personifies a kind of goofy sweetness, a quality further
enhanced by Robin Bartlett's exemplary performance. Miss Bartlett
is one of those radiant actresses who brings an intelligence and
intensity to every role they play. She did it two seasons ago with
her performance of an acerbic hooker in ``The Early Girl,'' also
presented by Circle Rep.
   The actress gets some strong support from John Dossett, as the
good-natured but strange Lloyd, Welker White as the silent
quadriplegic, Susan Blommaert as the jealous co-worker and
particularly Joyce Reehling as a succession of increasingly weird
shrinks.
   Director Norman Rene gives ``Reckless'' a thoughtful, fluid
production, that makes Rachel's journey move quickly.
   The title of the play pretty much suggests what the playwright
is doing. He doesn't play safe with either his characters or plot.
Lucas keeps everything off balance. It may make for some awkward
moments but the end result is an intriguing tilt, a play that
fascinates particularly because you can't second-guess where it is
going.

   A test program allowing cameras in state
courtrooms has resulted mostly in superficial news coverage,
disappointing advocates who had hoped for more substance, the judge
evaluating the experiment says.
   At the same time, the 18-month experiment, now about half over,
has not created the disruptions expected by its critics, said Chief
Administrative Judge Albert Rosenblatt.
   ``If there's no apparent damage and if it doesn't disserve in
any way the justice system, I think it's very hard to exclude on
practical, realistic or intellectual grounds,'' Rosenblatt said in
an interview Friday.
   ``If it's just a clean neutral, then the presence of a
television camera should be no different than wallpaper or the
color of the rug,'' he said. ``As long as it doesn't disserve, it's
a fact of life.''
   The judge stressed, however, that it was premature to conclude
whether the program should be extended past its May 31 expiration,
and he was equivocal in discussing its results so far. If it is
found to be merely inoffensive, he said, it may not merit the
administrative burden it has placed on the courts.
   Forty-four states allow some photographic coverage of
courtrooms, although the federal court system does not. New York's
experimental program began Dec. 1 in four upstate counties and June
1 statewide; Rosenblatt is to report on it to the Legislature, the
governor and the state's chief judge on March 31, two months before
it ends.
   The program allows camera and audio coverage of court
proceedings by radio and television stations, newspapers and
academic institutions, with approval of the presiding judge.
Denials can be appealed.
   As of mid-September, judges across the state had approved 427 of
482 applications for coverage, or 88.6 percent. Moreover,
Rosenblatt said he has received 255 evaluations of the program from
judges, with only 41 opposed.
   Lawyers, however, were divided: Of 225 who expressed views, 88
were in favor, 84 opposed and 53 neutral. Some lawyers fear camera
coverage will intimidate witnesses and jurors and impart notoriety
to their clients.
   The greatest concern for the program was that the presence of
cameras and recording equipment would disrupt court proceedings,
much as they did in the celebrated Lindbergh kidnapping trial in
1935, when radio announcers and cameramen jammed the Flemington,
N.J., courtroom.
   Those fears have not been realized, Rosenblatt said, largely
because of the advanced technology of electronic recording
equipment. But he said the greatest hopes for the program _ that it
would serve as an educational tool to increase public understanding
of the court system _ haven't occurred.
   ``An insight into the judicial process is a very healthy thing
for the community. We wanted to see whether that insight can be
arranged without in any ways detracting from the quality of justice
that we want to have. That in a nutshell is really the basis for
the experiment,'' Rosenblatt said.
   ``I'd been hopeful that the potential for education would be
realized to perhaps a greater degree than it has been,'' he said.
``We've not had a great deal of documentary coverage. We've not had
a great deal of coverage that goes beyond the very, very brief
segments of what might be a particularly notorious trial.''
   He said he would review the work of a committee evaluating the
program, conduct public hearings and consider the comments of
lawyers, judges and prosecutors before deciding whether to
recommend continuing to allow cameras in state courtrooms.

<HEAD>Fair Weather for Much of Nation; Rain in Gulf Coast Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Much of the nation enjoyed fair weather Sunday, but rain showers
persisted in the middle Atlantic states and the Gulf Coast region.
   Areas of high pressure were located over New England, the middle
Mississippi Valley and the southern Plateau and were responsible
for the pleasant weather.
   The showers and thunderstorms were scattered south of a cold
front that extended from northern Georgia to the western Gulf
Coast. Strong showers and thunderstorms developed over eastern
parts of South Carolina.
   Light rain showers were scattered from the central Appalachian
Mountains to the mid-Atlantic coast.
   A low pressure system moved inland Sunday morning across
northwest Washington, and rain was widely scattered across
Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
nearly an inch at Key West, Fla.; nearly a half-inch at Bluefield,
W.Va.; and over a quarter-inch at Olympia, Wash.
   High temperatures were in the 70s and 80s across much of the
nation Sunday afternoon. But 50s and 60s were recorded from the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Rocky Mountains, the northern
Plains, the central Appalachians, the mid-Atlantic region and parts
of New England.
   Temperatures were in the 90s in extreme southern Texas. Daytona
Beach, Fla., reached 93 degrees, tying the record high temperature
for the date set in 1941.
   Temperatures around the country at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 50
degrees at Grand Forks, N.D., to 95 degrees at Mayport, Fla. The
low in the nation Sunday morning was 16 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Monday called for a low pressure system to move
from the northern Plains into the upper Mississippi Valley and
spread rain showers from northern and eastern Minnesota across
central and northern Wisconsin into upper Michigan. A cold front
expected in the Pacific Northwest was to bring rain to that region.
The rest of the nation could expect fair skies.
   High temperatures were to be in the 60s from the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Plateau and over portions of the Great
Lakes region and parts of New England. Highs into the 90s were
expected from southwest Kansas into western Oklahoma and across
much of the southern half of Texas. And high readings across the
desert Southwest were to range from 90 to 100 degrees, with 70s and
80s for the rest of the country.

   Republican presidential nominee George Bush
holds a nine-point lead over Democrat Michael Dukakis, according to
a nationwide survey of registered voters released Sunday.
   The telephone poll of 1,002 registered voters found Bush favored
by 48 percent to Dukakis' 39 percent. Thirteen percent of those
surveyed supported other candidates or were undecided.
   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
   KRC Communications Research of Boston and the American Political
Network of McLean, Va., conducted the poll from Sept. 4-23 for The
Cleveland Plain Dealer.
   During the survey period, Bush's lead ranged from a low of 1
percentage point on Sept. 5 to a high of 11 percentage points on
Sept. 15-16.
   One question asked of the voters was which candidate was ``more
of a wimp.'' Twenty-eight percent of those polled said Bush, 17
percent named Dukakis and 21 percent thought both candidates had
the same ``wimp factor.''

   Communist party leaders meet Monday to
choose a prime minister who can get a grip on Poland's crumbling
economy and restore political stability before crucial talks begin
next month with the opposition.
   The second party plenum in a month will discuss formation of a
government to succeed that of Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner,
postwar Poland's eighth premier.
   Messner resigned Sept. 19 with all 19 of his ministers after a
barrage of criticism over its handling of the economy.
   But obervers ranging from Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to the
official party weekly Polityka said the appointment of a new
government has limited significance because the issue is not new
faces but fundamental changes in the system of governing.
   Diplomats and party sources suggested yet another government
might be formed in a few months anyway, depending on results of
mid-October round-table talks the government agreed to after a wave
of strikes. In that case, whoever is named prime minister this week
might be just a temporary caretaker.
   If the Central Committee agrees on a candidate, that person
would be named prime minister at the meeting scheduled Tuesday of
the Sejm, or parliament.
   Polish United Workers Party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski made
his own recommendation Saturday, the official PAP news agency said.
But there was no public announcement of his choice.
   Possible premier candidates mentioned include Politburo member
and economist Wladyslaw Baka, Politburo member and propaganda chief
Mieczyslaw Rakowski, Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak,
communist-allied Peasant Party leader Roman Malinowski and
Alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek.
   Whoever assumes the job will have a daunting task. Inflation in
Poland is running at 60 percent annually, consumer goods are in
short supply and workers are restive after staging two punishing
waves of strikes.
   The last series of strikes ended after authorities set aside
their longstanding opposition to negotiating with Solidarity,
agreeing to the round-table talks to consider legalizing the banned
trade union.
   Political journalist Daniel Passent of Polityka said he expected
whoever is chosen prime minister to continue the current
``predominant tendency'' in governing policies, but perhaps to
bring more members of the communist-allied Peasant and Democratic
parties into the government.
   But he said he considered it a correct decision to change the
government in the aftermath of the last wave of strikes between
Aug. 16 and Sept. 3 that affected at least 20 enterprises.
   Not to have shaken up the government would have made it seem
like ``business as usual,'' he said.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
whatever government is chosen is likely to be ``rather temporary.''
   Messner's team was ousted because ``they needed a scapegoat''
for the strikes and the poor economy, said the diplomat.
   But it was expected that the round-table talks could lead to a
more broadly based government that could include representatives of
church or even opposition groups, the diplomat said.

   Tens of thousands of Slavs rallied
in three cities Sunday to protest alleged persecution of Slavs by
ethnic Albanians in a southern province, the state news agency
Tanjug reported.
   Tanjug reported 80,000 people gathered in Novi Sad, capital of
Vojvodina province, 40 miles north of Belgrade, the nation's
capital.
   Tanjug also said about 30,000 rallied in Andrijevica, a town in
Montenegro province near the border with Kosovo, the troubled
southern province.
   The figures could not be independently confirmed. Tanjug's total
of 300,000 participants in a similar rally in the Montenegran town
of Niksic Saturday appeared grossly inflated, since reporters
watching the demonstrations said protesters numbered no more than
150,000.
   The agency later said another rally involving 15,000 took place
in the town of Prizren in Kosovo, which borders Albania.
   The rallies are designed to generate support for hard-line
Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in his campaign to tighten
control over Kosovo and Vojvodina, two autonomous provinces.
   The mostly Christian Slavs live in the Yugoslavian republics of
Serbia and Montenegro. Serbia administers Kosovo, where the mostly
Moslem Albanians make up 90 percent of the population and want a
greater political voice.
   In Andrijevica, Vlajko Cukic, from Kosovo, said the rallies were
aimed at searching for of solutions to prevent the use of weapons
and avoid ``fratricidal bloodshed. ... We consider honest Albanians
to be our brothers.''
   However, at virtually all rallies crowds have been clamoring for
strong-arm solutions and calling for weapons to go to Kosovo.
   Albanians in Kosovo contend the only reason about 30,000 Serbs
have emigrated from Kosovo since 1982 is poverty, noting that
14,000 Albanians have done the same.
   Vojvodina Premier Jon Srbovan denounced the pro-Milosevic
rallies as diverting attention from ``the basic issues of
fundamental importance for this country.''

   The ``Tobacco Road'' image the South once
had is no longer valid, said Southern governors, who issued a
report Sunday hailing economic and social progress in their region.
   Education reforms, initiatives in maternal and infant health and
attention to environmental issues have sharply improved the quality
of life in the region, according to the report, ``Success in the
South.''
   The governors are gathered in this resort town for a two-day
meeting.
   At least three governors _ Bill Clinton, D-Ark., Jim Martin,
R-N.C., and Carroll Campbell, R-S.C. _ were to attend the Michael
Dukakis-George Bush debate Sunday night. The rest of the activities
were to get under way Monday.
   Both candidates declined invitations to speak to the governors.
   Dukakis called Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris, the conference
host, on Saturday to express regrets.
   Harris told Dukakis he should skip health issues during the
debate and concentrate on other questions, said Barbara Morgan,
Harris' press secretary.
   Harris, who said last week he was afraid some would interpret
Dukakis' health care initiative as a plan for national health
insurance, told the candidate the topic appeals to rank-and-file
Democrats but not the undecided voters whose help will be needed to
put Democrats in the White House, Ms. Morgan said.
   Other items on tap for the governors include a discussion on
Martin's plan to seek a resolution calling for increased oversight
and enforcement of ocean disposal laws.
   The proposal, circulated in advance, calls on the Southern
States Energy Board to undertake a review of national and
international ocean dumping and disposal laws.

<HEAD>Tenants Face Eviction in Landlord Disagreement With HUD Over Rents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAROL STREAM, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owners of a subsidized housing complex
plan to drop their contract with the federal government, a move
that would force the elderly and disadvantaged tenants to either
move or pay huge rent increases.
   Tenants in 132 units at the Chateau Village apartment complex,
in Du Page County west of Chicago, were notified last week that the
owners plan to drop the contract with the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development if a renewal agreement can't be
reached by Jan. 31.
   Most of the tenants in Chateau Village receive federal rent
subsidies under which residents pay 30 percent of their income in
rent and HUD makes up the difference.
   The owners say HUD refuses to pay fair market prices for the
apartments, and some tenants feel abandoned by the government.
   ``The owners want to keep us here, but HUD wants to get rid of
us,'' said Larry Saladino, a tenant who lives on a monthly
disability check. ``They want to wash their hands of the elderly
and the children here.''
   Housing authorities said that as demand for housing in
fast-growing areas like Du Page County forces rents up, HUD offices
nationwide will have trouble keeping up with rent increases.
   ``This is a substantial problem, nationally, especially in areas
that are booming,'' said Catherine M. Bishop, staff attorney for
the National Housing Law Project in Berkeley, Calif.
   HUD spokesman Adolph Slaughter blames the nationwide housing
crunch on ``greedy developers who are seeking loopholes'' to get
out of providing housing for the poor.
   Without the subsidies, many of the poor, elderly and disabled
residents will be left looking for other subsidized housing or else
be forced to pay hefty rent increases.
   ``I don't know where I will go,'' said Beatrice Herzog, 75, who
has cancer and lives on a $358-a-month Social Security check. ``I
have friends here. This is my home.''
   ``We would be happy to renew our contract if HUD would come
close to what fair-market rents are,'' said Edward Schulz, vice
president of A&R Katz Management, agents for the complex. ``We have
not received a rent increase in the last three years.''
   HUD allows Chateau owners to charge $400 in monthly rent for a
one-bedroom apartment. The owners are seeking to raise the monthly
amount to $465 for 1989.
   The federal agency has said it will not budge from $400, even
though its figures show 1987 fair-market rent in Du Page County to
be $477 for a one-bedroom apartment, and $496-a-month for 1989.
   HUD's Slaughter said that if the contract were canceled, the
residents would recieve vouchers for other subsidized housing in
the area.
   But critics contend subsidized housing in Du Page County is
difficult to find, and that HUD has only set aside 5,000 vouchers
for the county.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified a
Spanish priest revered as the founder of California's missions but
reviled by some who say he whipped and enslaved the Indians he
worked to convert.
   The Rev. Junipero Serra moved a step toward sainthood when he
was made a ``blessed'' of the Roman Catholic Church along with five
other people, including a Mexican priest executed by a firing squad.
   John Paul beatified the six in an open-air Mass in St. Peter's
Square before a golden altar flanked by flowers and Swiss guards in
gold, blue and red uniforms.
   Speaking in English, the pope called Serra, an 18th century
Franciscan monk, ``a shining example of Christian virtue and the
missionary spirit.''
   ``His great goal was to bring the Gospel to the native peoples
of America, so that they too might be `consecrated in the truth,'''
John Paul told a crowd of 20,000 people.
   ``He sowed the seeds of Christian faith amid the momentous
changes wrought by the arrival of European settlers in the New
World. It was a field of missionary endeavor that required
patience, perserverance and humility, as well as vision and
courage,'' the pontiff said.
   Serra founded the first nine missions in what is now California,
and his order eventually established 21. During his U.S. visit a
year ago, John Paul stood before Serra's grave at the Carmel
Mission Basilica and praised the monk for his missionary work among
the Indians.
   Critics say Serra stole the Indians' lands, refused to allow
them to leave the missions, forced them to work in the fields or on
construction projects and exposed them to European diseases to
which they had no resistance.
   A group of nine historians, asked by Bishop Thaddeus Shubsda of
Monterey, Calif., to give their opinions on Serra, said in a report
last year that there was no evidence to support the charges against
him.
   They concluded Serra was being blamed for a few incidences of
abuse, most of which occurred years after his death in 1784.
   Rev. Miguel Agustin Pro, a Jesuit priest executed by Mexican
police in 1927, was the only martyr to be beatified Sunday. He died
at the height of the conflict between the Roman Catholic Church and
the anti-clerical party that started the Mexican revolution and
still governs the country.
   Pro was accused of taking part in an attempt to kill Mexican
ruler Gen. Alvaro Obregon. He was arrested and executed without a
trial.
   In Mexico on Sunday, church bells rang in Chihuahua to
commemorate the beatification, and Mexicans packed Mexico City's
Basilica of Guadalupe, the country's most sacred shrine, for a
special Mass.
   Late Saturday, about 3,000 Catholics met at a building in Mexico
City where Pro was executed, then marched to the church where he is
buried.
   Among those at the gathering was Dolores Pro, a niece of the
priest.
   ``I don't forget the reasons they killed my uncle,'' she said.
``I want a free Mexico, democratic, with an effective vote.''
   John Paul praised Pro for organizing secret communion services
during ``the years of presecution,'' but some believe Pro also was
a political activist who disguised himself as a laborer and mingled
with the working classes.
   Photographs show Pro kneeling in prayer, then standing before a
government firing squad with his arms open and holding a rosary and
a crucifix before collapsing and receiving a final shot from a
police officer.
   Just before he died, Pro shouted, ``Christ the king lives.''
   The Mexican government has made no official comment about the
beatification. But a leftist magazine, Proceso, called it ``a slap
in the face of the revolution.''
   Others beatified Sunday were the Cardinal Giuseppe Benedetto
Dusmet, a 19th century archbishop of the Sicilian city of Catania
who devoted his life to the poor; and the Rev. Francesco Faa di
Bruno, a 19th century Italian priest who founded an order of nuns.
   The pope also beatified the Rev. Frederic Janssoone Bollengier,
a French missionary in the Holy Land and Canada who died in 1916,
and Josefa Naval Girbes, a 19th century Spanish woman who opened
catechism schools for young people and adults.

   A return of gusty winds
brought renewed activity on some fires in Yellowstone National
Park, but officials remained confident Sunday they could keep them
in check.
   Helicopters continued to dump water from 700-gallon buckets onto
areas where fire crews worked to douse hot spots as temperatures
reached into the 60s and winds gusted to 25 mph.
   Officials estimate the fires thus far have burned as much as 60
percent of an area covering 1.6 million acres of Yellowstone and
the surrounding national forests.
   Forecasts both for Yellowstone and the Shoshone National Forest,
north of Yellowstone where the Clover-Mist fire is burning, called
for continued gusty winds and higher temperatures on Monday.
   Yellowstone spokeswoman Marsha Karle said the weather could
possibly pose problems for firefighters, but added she didn't
believe firefighters were as concerned as they were over the summer.
   ``I think it's just one of those things where we'll have to wait
and see,'' she said.
   Officials still plan to release this week the approximately
4,100 Army soldiers and Marines brought in to bolster civilian
firefighters, she said.
   And Yellowstone Superintendent Bob Barbee said some backcountry
areas have been reopened for overnight camping and day use.
   In the Shoshone National Forest, about 1,000 firefighters faced
50 mph winds while trying to battle the 412,550-acre Clover-Mist
fire.

<TEXT>
   A measure to move up the date of local
elections was spurned by voters Monday, but Premier Turgut Ozal
vowed to remain in office despite an earlier threat that a losing
vote might lead to his resignation.
   State television reported early Monday that with 86 percent of
the votes counted, 65 percent of the electorate voted against and
35 percent in favor of the constitutional amendment during Sunday's
national referendum.
   Ozal, whose government is battling an annual inflation rate of
78 percent, threatened last week to quit if voters overwhelmingly
reject the amendment.
   But he said in a televised address that the result was
satisfactory because the ``yes'' vote was about the same as the 36
percent garnered by his Motherland Party last year.
   The percentage, the largest of any party in the elections, gave
the party control of Parliament.
   ``The people chose economic development and stability,
unchanging their appreciation of us under the most difficult
conditions,'' Ozal said of the unofficial returns.
   The referendum was on a constitutional amendment adopted last
month with the support of the Motherland Party. It would empower
Parliament to move up the date of municipal elections from March
1989 to Nov. 23.
   Some say Ozal wants to hold local elections soon so the
opposition Social Democrats won't have time to reorganize under new
leadership.
   An immediate change of government is unlikely because the
Motherland Party holds 290 seats in the 450-member Parliament.
   But Ozal, 61, may find it difficult to rule until 1992, when his
five-year mandate expires, if the vote shows his nationwide support
is significantly eroded, observers say.
   Opposition leaders Erdal Inonu of the Social Democrat Populist
Party and former Premier Suleyman Demirel, who heads the centrist
True Path Party, portrayed the result as a defeat for the
61-year-old premier.
   ``He has not received the support he was seeking,'' said Inonu.
   ``This government has been rejected by the people,'' said
Demirel.
   Meanwhile, two soldiers were slain Sunday in the eastern
province of Bingol when suspected Kurdish guerrillas opened fire on
a vehicle carrying polling officials, Anatolia reported Sunday.
   Six people were hurt in a clash with rocks and stones in the
eastern province of Malatya after two election officials accused
each other of cheating, the agency said. Five were injured during a
fistfight in the Black Sea coastal province of Trabzon that began
with a political argument.
   Ozal has cited Turkey's economic growth _ an average 7.5 percent
for the past two years. Inflation is a byproduct of the high
spending which fueled the growth.
   The boom has brought electricity, roads, telephones and
affordable housing to most corners of the country, including the
backward southeast. Acceptance of 60,000 Kurdish refugees from Iraq
is believed to have strengthened Ozal's standing in the region
populated by Turkey's own Kurdish minority.

<HEAD>Jury Returns Death Sentence in Decapitation of Church Handyman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury on Sunday sentenced to death a
minister who stole $30,000 in church funds, decapitated a handyman
and threw the body parts into a lake in an attempt to fake his own
death and collect insurance money.
   The jury returned the verdict against John David Terry after 13
hours of debate and a brief church service.
   Terry, 44, was convicted Thursday of decapitating James Chester
Matheny, 32, and setting fire to the Emmanuel Church of Christ
Oneness Pentecostal June 15, 1987, to cover up the crime and fake
his own death.
   Prosecutors said Terry bought a motorcycle, took out a $150,000
life insurance policy in April 1987, gathered false identification
papers in the name of a boy who drowned in 1951 and torched the
building with Matheny's body inside to conceal the identity of the
victim.
   In addition to cutting off Matheny's head, a tattoo on his arm
was sliced off to further conceal his identity. The body parts were
thrown into Lake Barkley near Dover, Tenn.
   Terry did not react when the verdict was read, but his wife,
Brenda, cried. Matheny's ex-wife, Teresa, also cried.
   Davidson County Circuit Court Judge Walter Kurtz set an April 3
date for the death by electrocution, but the case will be appealed
automatically to the Tennessee Supreme Court. Tennessee hasn't
executed a death row inmate since Nov. 7, 1960.

   Thousands of demonstrators, some hurling rocks,
jammed downtown streets Sunday to protest international financial
policy toward Third World nations, and smaller rallies continued
into the night.
   The marchers stopped within shouting distance of West Berlin's
International Congress Center, where World Bank and International
Monetary Fund talks were being held, and staged a giant protest.
   Late Sunday night, smaller groups of demonstrators gathered in
the city, at one point turning over a police van downtown, police
said.
   Riot police circled one group of 200 protesters, who dispersed
without incident. Another group of about 600 demonstrators
dispersed when police drove up in vans.
   Organizers said about 80,000 people participated in the march,
but police put the number at 27,000.
   Police said militants hit three photographers taking pictures
during the 2{-mile march, but spokesmen for the demonstration said
they believed undercover police officers were the assailants. The
photographers were not hurt, police said.
   Some people hurled stones at passing cars and threw paint-filled
balloons at banks, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   A police spokesman said ``a number of people were detained'' in
demonstration-related disturbances, but he had no precise number or
other details.
   Masked radicals and German leftists joined activists from Asia
and Latin America and church group members. They carried banners
and chanted slogans denouncing the policies of industrial nations
toward debt-ridden poor nations. ``We have broken through the
national and political barriers,'' said march organizer Dieter
Bricke, a leading member of West Germany's leftist Greens party.
``There are members of the Catholic Church who are here marching
with communists. That is quite an achievement.''
   Walking about 30 abreast, the marchers chanted slogans
denouncing what they called the ``murderous polices'' of the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
   The 151-nation IMF has spearheaded a program of financial aid to
developing nations with enormous debts. The World Bank, its sister
organization, offers these countries aid for economic development
programs.
   But critics say conditions attached to the assistance are
crippling Third World countries and creating poverty.
   Marchers carried banners reading ``The Profits of IMF Are The
Misery of the Third World,'' ``Stop Starvation,'' and
``Imperialism, Your Days Are Numbered.'' Another banner showed a
banker taking dollar bills from the ribs of a starving peasant.
   Members of the Greens party, including Jutta Ditfurth, a member
of the West German Parliament, led protesters representing 120
groups.
   Protesters chanted ``IMF-Murder Fund!'' and ``IMF and World Bank
Must Go!''
   The march began on Kurfuerstendamm, West Berlin's main
boulevard, and ended at a square about 1,000 feet from the
International Congress Center. Armored cars and a mobile water
cannons were parked near the square and ringed the congress
building.
   The mostly young crowd was in good spirits, with some carrying
children on their shoulders.
   A convoy of 15 vans filled with police officers led the
protesters. Two columns of riot police wearing helmets and carrying
shields and truncheons flanked a group of about 1,000 leftist
extremists, many of whom wore ski masks to hide their identities.
   About 10,000 police have guarded the city during the meetings,
expected to draw 12,000 financial officials, bankers and
journalists. The discussions began Thursday and will last until
Sept. 29.
   About 2,700 police officers were brought in from across West
Germany to strengthen the city's security ranks.

   The first question, by agreement between the two candidates,
goes to Vice President Bush.
   It is a domestic question.
   You have two minutes for an answer, sir. The polls say the No. 1
domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs.
   What is there about these times that drives or draws so many
Americans to use drugs?
   Bush: I think we've seen a deterioration of values.
   I think for a while, as a nation, we condoned those things we
should have condemned. For a while, as I recall, it even seems to
me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana
and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.
   So, we've seen a deterioration in values. And one of the things
that I think we should do about it, in terms of cause, is to
instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away --
we got into this feeling that value-free education was the thing.
   And I don't believe that at all. I do believe there are
fundamental rights and wrongs, as far as use.

<TEXT>
   The third-ranking prelate in the Church of England
said Sunday he will refuse to recognize the Rev. Barbara C. Harris,
the first woman bishop in the Anglican church.
   The Bishop of London, the Rt. Rev. Graham Leonard, said electing
a woman bishop was ``secular in origin and thought'' and will cause
deep divisions in the church.
   ``In common with many other bishops, I would be unable to
recognize a woman bishop or the validity of any ordinations or
confirmations performed by her,'' said a statement by Leonard, the
leading opponent of women priests and bishops in Britain.
   Harris, 58, on Saturday was elected suffragan, or assistant,
bishop for the eastern Massachusetts diocese, the largest in the
Episcopal Church in the United States in terms of both geography
and population.
   Opponents say bishops are regarded as the successors of the
original 12 apostles of Jesus Christ, who were men.
   Bishops from the world's 27 Anglican churches approved a
carefully worded compromise resolution in Canterbury, England, this
summer saying they would respect and remain in fellowship with
churches that have women priests and bishops, even if they disagree
with their principles.
   The vote at the Lambeth Conference, held once every 10 years,
was 423-28.
   The conference also ordered Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, spiritual leader of the Church of England and 70 million
Anglicans worldwide, to establish a commission to ward off any
split in the church over the consecration of women bishops. The
commission is to meet for the first time in November.
   Runcie said Harris' election would have far-reaching
consequences for the character of the church and its relations with
other churches.
   ``I know, however, there will be some in the Church of England
and the Anglican communion who feel they will not be able to
recognize a woman as a bishop, or those ordained by her,'' Runcie
said.
   About 1,200 women priests have been ordained by American
Episcopalians and Anglicans in Canada and New Zealand.

<HEAD>Harvard Law School Adopts Speech Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harvard Law School has adopted
guidelines designed to ensure free speech after an incident last
year when a protester prevented former Contra leader Adolfo Calero
from speaking.
   Under the rules, speakers must respond to questions from the
audience and abide by the decisions of a moderator. Disruptive
demonstrators can be ejected.
   The guidelines were created by a committee formed by law school
officials after Tufts University student Joshua Laub jumped onto a
podium and yelled epithets at Calero when the Nicaraguan rebel
leader was speaking at Harvard last October.
   After Laub was arrested, the speech was canceled, and Harvard's
ability to serve as a forum for free speech came under question.
   ``It seems to have achieved what a year ago would have been
perceived to be difficult,'' said Richard Parker, a law professor
and member of the committee. ``Protest is allowed, but within
limits.''
   Committee members say the guidelines attempt to find a middle
ground between allowing speakers to present their message and
permitting protesters the right to dissent.
   Law professor and committee member Alan Dershowitz said the
nine-member committee, composed of administrators, faculty and
students, strived to be sensitive to giving audience members free
speech.
   ``A good way to handle questions about how much protest is
acceptable is to force the speaker to confront the criticism,''
Parker said of the stipulation requiring speakers to face questions.
   Committee members said the moderator has the power to suspend,
move or cancel speeches. The guidelines also say people introducing
speakers should not be from the group sponsoring the event.

   And of course, as far as the _ how we make it better _ yes, we
can do better on interdiction, but we've got to do a lot better on

got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole

   Lehrer: Governor, a follow-up question; you have two minutes to
answer it. Are you suggesting, sir, that President Reagan is one of
the causes of the drug problem in this country?
   Dukakis: I'm saying that those of us who are elected to
positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special
responsibility, not only to come up with programs _ and I have
outlined in detail a very important, very strong program of
enforcement as well as drug education and prevention _ and Mr. Bush
is right, the two go hand-in-hand.
   But if our government itself is doing business with people who
we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if
we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to
our young people. It's a little difficult for me to understand just
how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to
young people like her all over the country and say to them, ``We
want to help you.''
   Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on
enforcement at home and abroad; doubling the number of drug
enforcement agents; having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th
of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies
together here in this hemisphere and go to work together.
   But, we also have to take demand seriously.
   You know we have 5 percent of the world's population in this
country. We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.

   The Rev. Barbara C. Harris, elected the
first woman bishop in the Anglican Communion's 450-year history,
said Sunday her elevation is the latest step in a movement to bring
the church into the mainstream.
   Ms. Harris, 58, a former public relations executive, was elected
Saturday to the position of suffragan, or assistant, bishop for the
eastern Massachusetts diocese of the Episcopal Church. The diocese,
which includes Boston, is the nation's largest in both geography
and population.
   ``A fresh wind is blowing across this church of ours,'' she said
in her first sermon at Philadelphia's Church of the Advocate since
her election.
   Several elections earlier this year show the church is changing,
said Ms. Harris, who is black. Two black priests were elected
coadjutor bishops, who are first in line to succeed their presiding
bishops, without first serving as assistants.
   One of them, the Rev. Herbert Thompson Jr., was installed in
Cincinnati on Saturday as the first black bishop of the Episcopal
Diocese of Southern Ohio.
   Ms. Harris told a congregation of 50 people that her election
``is of significance to the Episcopal Church in the United States
and to the worldwide Anglican Communion.''
   The Episcopal Church is one of 27 self-governing church bodies
in 164 countries around the world that make up the Anglican
Communion. About 70 million people belong, with 2.5 million in the
United States.
   The third-ranking prelate in the Church of England said Sunday
he will refuse to recognize Ms. Harris or any other woman bishop.
   ``I have already stated publicly ... that I would not be able to
be in communion with a woman so elected and consecrated,'' said the
Rt. Rev. Graham Leonard, bishop of London.
   Bishops at a world Anglican conference this summer approved a
resolution saying they would respect and remain in fellowship with
churches that have women priests and bishops, even if they disagree
with their principles.
   The conference also ordered Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie to establish a commission to ward off any split in the
church over the issue. The commission is scheduled to meet for the
first time in November.
   Ms. Harris likened the church's actions to the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination in
1984 and 1988.
   Like Jackson's ``rainbow coalition,'' an attempt to reach across
color and sex lines, the church's movement gives ``new hope ... and
new vision to hundreds of thousands'' who have felt alienated and
ignored by the church, Ms. Harris said.
   The church is attempting to include everyone in the mainstream
``of God's justice, grace, brotherhood and sisterhood,'' she said
in her sermon.
   After services, Ms. Harris read a statement saying she was
``deeply honored'' to accept the position. She said she could not
answer questions until a news conference Tuesday in Boston.
   The Rev. Paul Washington, retired from the Church of the
Advocate, said Ms. Harris' election will allow other qualified
women to move into bishop positions.
   He said black people will be more willing to listen to her views
because ``we are a people who have a certain amount of respect for
persons in authority'' and now they will ``attach her views to a
voice of authority.''
   Ms. Harris grew up in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. A
childhood friend, Millicent Hartsfield, attended the sermon. She
said Ms. Harris ``had a strong commitment to the church even as a
young person.''
   ``But she was also fun-loving,'' Ms. Hartsfield said. ``She
still is. She hasn't changed much.''
   Ms. Harris was a parishioner at the Church of the Advocate in
1974 when the first 11 female Episcopal priests were ordained there
_ against church rules at the time.
   Ms. Harris, a divorcee, was ordained a priest in 1980, four
years after the church changed its policy. Previously she was a
public relations executive.
   She was pastor in Norristown from 1980 to 1984, then became the
executive director of the Episcopal Publishing Co.

   The Communist Party's Central Committee this week
will tackle a drastic slowdown in China's previously headlong dash
toward free markets and modernization.
   The meeting of the 175-member committee, which formally sets
party policy, could turn out to be more important than the 13th
Party Congress of October 1987, at which new party chief Zhao
Ziyang optimistically promised, ``We shall catch up with the
developed capitalist countries.''
   Since then, Zhao's rapid moves to free prices and markets from
central control have produced the highest inflation in two decades,
at more than 20 percent, and an atmosphere of wheeling-dealing and
corruption that has horrified many party leaders.
   People panicked by the rising prices joined in runs on banks in
major cities in August, then went on a collective spending spree
not seen since before the Communist takeover in 1949.
   A party work meeting held last week to prepare for the Central
Committee session that begins Monday announced that improving the
economic environment _ a code for reducing inflation _ would be the
main task for the next two years, rather than the wage and price
reform that many experts believe is essential for China's
transformation from a centrally planned economy.
   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, said Sunday that the
Central Committee would discuss a work report by Zhao, but it gave
no clue as to the contents.
   However, recent statements by top officials indicate that in
addition to putting price reform on hold for two years, the report
will call for clamping down on the fast-growing money supply and
slowing economic growth from the current overheated 11 percent to 7
to 8 percent.
   Only four months ago, official newspapers were energetically
defending mandated food price hikes intended to reduce huge
government subsidies, and hinting that the national staple, rice,
would be the next reform target.
   But Vice Premier Yao Yilin told visiting Soviet price reformers
Friday that China is not prepared to release controls on the prices
of grain and other staples.
   Similarly, the People's Daily announced this month that steel
and other key raw materials will remain under central control
indefinitely despite earlier talk of creating free markets for them.
   Some foreign reports attribute the new caution to Premier Li
Peng, a methodical technocrat, and fear he may have eclipsed the
more daring Zhao. But the concensus among Western diplomats is that
while the uncontrolled inflation may cost Zhao prestige, there is
no indication he is in serious political trouble.
   Chinese leaders insist they still plan to scrap the central
planning, subsidized prices and egalitarian wage system that
stagnated the economy for decades. But faced with growing public
dissatisfaction, they now put the emphasis on restoring economic
order.
   Complaints about high prices are a conversation staple. But
there are other signs of public disaffection. Resentment of the
new, relatively wealthy class of free traders is common, as is fear
of the new competition.
   ``The problem is that many people can't stand to see others
doing better,'' said a stylishly dressed young working woman.
   Like the leadership, ordinary people fear pushing forward with
reform but don't want to retreat either.
   ``All anyone wants now is to make money _ that's all young
people talk about,'' said a store clerk in his teens. The reforms
of the past decade have brought most Chinese unprecedented
prosperity, and no one wants to give that up.

   And, in my state, I'm proud to say we've organized a drug
education prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement
Administration says is a model for the country.
   We're helping youngsters.
   We're reaching out to them.
   And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning
in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our
state and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary
school in the United States of America.
   And we've got to begin early _ in the first, second, and third
grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very,
very dangerous substances.
   I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill
those values, how we create this environment for the drug free
schools that we want in this country _ if he or representatives of
the administration are either dealing with and involving people
like Noriega in our foreign policy or don't pursue that connection
in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an
example to our kids all over this country.
   Lehrer: A minute to rebut, Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: The other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.
I asked for and received the same briefing.
   I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified
information, and what I'm about to say is unclassified.
   Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.
   It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to
justice.
   And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no
evidence that governor _ that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no
hard evidence until we indicted him.
   And, so, I think, it's about time we get this Noriega matter in
perspective.
   Panama is a friendly country.
   I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about
cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but
there was no evidence at that time.
   And when the evidence was there, we indicted him, and we want to
bring him to justice, and so, call off all those pickets out there
that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.

<TEXT>
   The head of the Chicago Transit Authority wants
to double the authority's police force in light of slayings on a
train and a bus and a rape near a station within two weeks.
   ``With all the priorities this city has, this has got to be one
of them,'' said Robert E. Paaswell, executive director of the
transit authority. ``I'm fed up to the point where I'm going to go
to bat for more police officers.''
   The force is made up of 222 officers.
   On Sept. 12, attorney Bruce W. Plattenberger was shot to death
on a rapid transit train during a robbery that remains unsolved.
   Two 16-year-olds have been charged in the slaying of Anthony
Bruno, 17, six days later on a bus. Police believe he was killed
because his assailants thought he belonged to a rival gang.
   And during the Thursday evening rush hour, a woman was raped at
a downtown elevated train station.
   Chicago's mass transit police unit is responsible for 142 rapid
transit stations, 215 miles of track and 2,247 buses, which carry
about 1.9 million riders a day.
   In addition, the city has 100 off-duty city police officers
providing security on buses.
   Paaswell and Police Supt. LeRoy Martin last week agreed to
replace the moonlighting officers with a full-time force of 50
officers and add 10 police attack dogs to patrol the elevated
commuter train system.

   Lehrer: All right. The next question will be asked by John
Mashek. It goes to Governor Dukakis, and you will have two minutes
to answer.
   Mashek: Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters
this year is the bulging federal deficit. In a Dukakis
administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort.
Would you identify for us then, please, three specific programs
that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down.
   Dukakis: Yes, I've been very specific about those, John, and let
me lay out for you my own strategy for bringing that deficit down,
because as the chief executive that's balanced 10 budgets in a row,
I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.
   First, I have suggested that there are certain weapons systems
which we don't need and we can't afford.
   Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are
the kinds of tough choices you have to make.
   I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we
should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.
   Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this
country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of
growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.
   Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we
come up with a good solid plan with the Congress for bringing that
deficit down.
   And finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and
billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this
country. It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his
taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go
uncollected.
   I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas
where we can make some cuts.
   We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in
this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent
future without spending $20 (billion) to $25 billion a year, which
is what we've been doing under this administration.
   We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time
save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare
to get off of welfare, and to become productive citizens again.

<2ND_LINE>AM-Armstrong's Birthday,0250</2ND_LINE>
<HEAD>Historian: July 4 Not Louis Armstrong's Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A music historian has learned something jazz
trumpeter Louis Armstrong never knew about himself _ his birthday.
   New Orleans has long celebrated July 4 as Satchmo's birthday as
well as that of the United States.
   But Tad Jones says he has proof that the jazzman not only wasn't
born on Independence Day 1900, but was more than a year younger
than he thought.
   Jones has a certificate from Sacred Heart of Jesus Church
showing that Louis Armstrong was baptized there on Aug. 25, 1901,
three weeks after his birth on Aug. 4.
   Music scholars have long suspected that Armstrong's claim of a
July 4, 1900, birth was simply a convenient fiction for the world's
best-known jazz musician and one of America's best-known citizens.
   Many poor, ill-educated blacks born around the turn of the
century didn't know their birthdays. Scholars figured that
Armstrong, whose birthday apparently never was celebrated when he
was a child, simply borrowed the nation's birthday for his own.
   Officials at Sacred Heart of Jesus were aware of the baptismal
record for Louis Armstrong but assumed it could not be the same
person because the date was so far from the generally accepted one,
Jones said. But the parents' names on the baptismal entry matched,
and also fit with a 1910 census record and an earlier biographical
reference saying the child was christened at Sacred Heart, Jones
said.

<HEAD>Panama President Leaves For UN General Assembly Meeting In New
York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Manuel Solis Palma left for
New York Sunday and said his appearance before the U.N. General
Assembly will give him the recognition denied him by the U.S.
government.
   ``The major accomplishment of my trip to the United Nations is
not in my speech. It is in the sole fact of my being there and
being recognized by all the countries of the world as the
constitutional president of Panama,'' he said.
   The 71-year-old Solis Palma then boarded an Ecuadorian Airlines
flight at Torrijos International Airport, 25 miles east of Panama
City.
   It was his first trip abroad since Feb. 26, when members of the
Legislative Assembly controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle and named Solis Palma interim
president.
   Noriega, chief of the nation's 15,000-member Defense Forces, is
considered the real power behind the government.
   The U.S. government continues to recognize Delvalle as the
country's legitimate leader. Noriega has been indicted on drug
trafficking charges by two federal grand juries in Florida.
   Before his ouster, Delvalle tried to have Noriega removed as
head of the Defense Forces.
   Solis Palma and the 38 members of his delegation were granted
limited visas to attend the meeting, a U.S. State Department
official said last week.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
visas limit the Panamanians' movements to New York City to use of
the shortest direct routes connecting airports, hotels and U.N.
headquarters.
   Noriega is not a member of the delegation, but Foreign Minister
Jorge Ritter said Friday that Noriega had planned to go to the U.N.
meeting. The State Department official said he was unaware of any
visa application by Noriega and said it would be surprising if he
had applied.

<HEAD>Dukakis Takes Pledge of Allegiance Issue Away from Bush</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Vice President George Bush may have
waved the flag at presidential rival Michael Dukakis once too
often. Before a national audience Sunday night, Bush raised the
pledge of allegiance issue and Dukakis took it away from him.
   ``I hope that people don't think that I am questioning his
patriotism,'' said the Republican presidential nominee after
bringing up Dukakis' membership in the American Civil Liberties
Union and his veto of legislation that would have required teachers
to lead Massachusetts public school students in the recitation of
the pledge of allegiance.
   ``Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism,''
said the Democratic nominee. ``I don't think there's any question
about that and I resent it, I resent it.
   ``My parents came to this country as immigrants. They taught me
this was the greatest country in the world. I'm in public service
because I love this country. I believe in it and nobody's going to
question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.''
   It was a particularly passionate statement from a politician who
was asked just moments earlier about his perceived lack of passion,
his image as ``the smartest clerk in the world.''
   The pledge of allegiance issue has become a central theme of
Bush's attacks on Dukakis. The Massachusetts governor, while
affirming his support of the pledge of allegiance, said he vetoed
the bill because a state Supreme Court advisory opinion said it was
unconstitutional.
   Late in the debate, Bush delivered one of his strongest
statements as he responded to a question about his selection of
Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana to be his vice president.
   ``I'm putting my confidence in a whole generation of people who
are in their 30s and in their 40s,'' responded Bush.
   ``Judge the man on his record, not on a lot of rumors and
innuendo and trying to fool around with his name,'' Bush continued.
   Dukakis usually refers to Quayle scornfully as ``J. Danforth
Quayle.''
   ``Do you know who J. Danforth was?'' asked Bush, looking at
Dukakis. ``He was a man who gave his life in World War II. So,
ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process.''
   From the start of their 90-minute debate _ an event widely
regarded as pivotal in a presidential campaign with no clear front
runner and an electorate with no strong feelings about either
candidate _ Dukakis was on the attack.
   The first question was about drugs and the Democratic nominee
swiftly tossed out one of his most familiar lines, his accusation
that the Reagan administration has been ``dealing with a
drug-running Panamanian dictator.''
   Bush was ready.
   ``Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.'' he
said. ``It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man
to justice.''
   The first volley of one-liners came on a question about the
federal budget deficit.
   Dukakis said he couldn't understand how Bush could balance the
budget and also increase defense spending, cut capital gains taxes,
and refuse to consider any other tax increases.
   ``If he keeps this up he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American
politics,'' said Dukakis, in a reference to Isuzu commercials in
which the salesman makes wildly implausible claims for the car.
   ``That answer was about as clear as Boston Harbor,'' retorted
Bush, who has scored points in this campaign with an attack on
pollution in Dukakis' front yard.
   If Dukakis was the first to go on the attack, Bush was not far
behind.
   The vice president touched on all the issues that he has raised
during the past six weeks, a period that has seen a dramatic shift
in the polls as Dukakis' big lead evaporated.
   But Dukakis was well-prepared for many of those attacks.
   On the abortion issue, Bush said he had not worked out the
penalties he would like to impose on a woman who had the procedure.
   ``He's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this
choice,'' responded Dukakis, who declared his own opposition to
abortion but said a woman had the right to choose whether to have
one.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ George Bush and Michael Dukakis
greeted one another congenially Sunday at the start of their first
presidential debate _ but dropped any pretense of cordiality with
the first round of questions.
   The two candidates strode energetically to center stage for the
head-to-head encounter, shook hands amiably and then got down to
business.
   Dukakis got the first laugh of the encounter when he questioned
Bush's tax and spending policies.
   ``If Bush keeps it up,'' Dukakis said, ``he's going to be the
Joe Isuzu of American politics,'' referring to the comical,
less-than-forthright car company spokesman featured in TV
advertisements.
   Bush's quick comeback: ``Is the time we unleash our
one-liners?.''
   He paused, then drew a big round of laugher and applause when he
said of Dukakis' statements: ``That answer was about as clear as
Boston Harbor,'' a reference to the polluted body of water in
Dukakis' home state.
   Both campaigns were keenly aware that the messages Bush and
Dukakis hoped to deliver to millions of television viewers could be
bolstered _ or undermined _ by their personal appearance and
mannerisms.
   Dukakis stood virtually motionless except for gesturing with his
hands as he spoke and sipping water occasionally between questions.
Bush shifted around a little more and fidgeted with his hands
between questions, sometimes taking notes with a pen while his
opponent spoke.
   Bush at times became heated as the debate wore on, particularly
when defending his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana. He
mopped his brow with a handkerchief after making his closing
statement.
   At the debate's conclusion, the two men shook hands, then Bush
approached the questioners' table and shook hands with the
panelists. Dukakis walked over to embrace his wife, Kitty, who came
on stage. Bush also kissed his wife, Barbara, when she came on
stage.
   In a campaign as close as this one, little things assume a lot
of importance.
   Thus, Bush and Dukakis took time for predebate walk-throughs to
familiarize themselves with the debate site at Wake Forest
University's Wait Chapel, where a red-carpeted stage and blue
backdrop were built over the chapel altar.
   Aides brought several sets of shirts and neckties to determine
which looked better on Dukakis under the TV lights, said media
consultant Frank Greer. He opted for a white shirt and red tie to
go with the bluish-gray suit he had selected.
   Bush wore a dark blue suit.
   ``Appearance is very important,'' said Greer, who has advised
candidates on presidential debates since 1976, including the last
one between President Reagan and Democratic challenger Walter
Mondale in 1984.
   Greer said Dukakis was wearing light makeup, mostly to minimize
shadows under his eyes, but that very little makeup was needed for
either candidate because the lighting had been carefully arranged
to make both of them look good.
   Bush's podium was 48 inches high, while Dukakis, who stands
nearly a half-foot shorter than the vice president, had a 45-inch
lectern and got a few inches of lift from a riser inserted subtly
beneath the carpeting behind his podium.
   The candidates hoped to demonstrate both knowledge and
likability.
   Bush told reporters earlier that he wanted to master details but
also to project his feelings, so people could ``see me for what I
think I am.''
   Greer said he had coached Dukakis on projecting a warmer image
and had advised him to ``go heavy on style.'' The Massachusetts
governor is perceived by his aides as having a curt, technocratic
style.
   ``What everyone forgets is you win debates on style, not
substance,'' Greer said.
   ``People don't want you to be an encyclopedia,'' he said. ``It's
much more creating warmth and feeling. You're playing to people
sitting in their living rooms.''
   Greer recalled that Reagan was briefed in so much detail for his
first debate with Mondale four years ago that he gave a somewhat
rambling, stumbling performance.
   The debate set in Wait Chapel was designed to produce an
intimate atmosphere. The table for media questioners was positioned
about eight feet in front of the debaters' lecterns.
   To help boost the candidates, each campaign flew in a supporting
cast of politicians to give glowing post-debate critiques of how
Bush and Dukakis performed.
   For Dukakis, they included Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and
Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts,
Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of Ohio, Carl Levin of
Michigan and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.
   Bush's boosters included pollster Robert Teeter, senior campaign
officials Lee Atwater and Craig Fuller; Govs. John Sununu of New
Hampshire and Jim Martin of North Carolina, Sen. Alan Simpson of
Wyoming, former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont and former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.

<HEAD>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.: citizens again.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this
is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit
down given what he says he wants to do.
   He seems to want to want to spend a great deal of money on just
about every weapon system, he says he's against new taxes although
he's broken that pledge at least three times in the last year that
I know of.
   He wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a
five-year $40 billion tax break, and he also wants to spend a lot
of money on additional programs.
   If he keeps this up he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American
politics.
   (Laughter.)
   But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me, but I
will say this _
   Lehrer: Your two minutes is up, governor.
   Dukakis: _ if he's serious about what he's saying then the only
place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social
Security trust fund, and he tried that in 1985 and I think he's
going to try that again.
   Lehrer: You have a minute to rebut.
   Bush: Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?
   That answer was about as clear as Boston Harbor. (Laughter.)
   Let me help the governor.
   There's so many things there I don't quite know where to begin.
   When you cut capital gains you put people to work. John Kennedy
proposed cutting capital gains. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator
from Massachusetts, said ``the dumbest thing I did was to oppose
the capital gains cut.''
   It's not going to cost the government money, it's going to
increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to
create jobs.
   So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference
between us.
   Now Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but
nevertheless the governor raised taxes five different times.
   That happens to be a fact.
   And so lets kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a
specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits
_ economists on the East Coast and West think it's good _ it
permits the president to sort out the priorities and we continue to
grow because I will not raise taxes.

<HEAD>World Bank Offers $1.2 Billion in Loans to Argentina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of World Bank on Sunday offered
$1.25 billion in new development loans to Argentina, which already
is more than $49 billion in debt.
   The loans are to be approved by the bank's 151 member
governments and much of the money is subject to agreed conditions,
including allowing more competition in some sectors of the
Argentine economy.
   ``Let me be blunt,'' Barber B. Conable, World Bank president
said in West Berlin, where World Bank and International Monetery
Fund talks were being held. ``Argentina faces difficult problems
and a tough battle to escape the low- growth, high-debt,
high-inflation trap it is in.
   ``But I am convinced that the program the government has
designed is a major step in the right direction,'' Conable said.
   Argentine Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille, in a letter
Thursday outlining his program, said Argentine inflation was
running 30 percent a month in August, was down to a third of that
in September and would be much less in October.
   His program also promised to cut the government deficit from 4.6
percent of the country's gross national product this year to no
more than 2.4 percent in 1989.
   Frank Vogl, World Bank's chief spokesman, said $150 million
would be disbursed in October, $350 million early next year and
$200 million in the late spring. After the first $150 million, the
next $550 million would be subject to agreed conditions.
   ``If they don't make the reforms, they don't get the money,''
said Vogl said.
   Conable said another $550 million will be loaned for low-cost
housing and electric power projects, loans to be disbursed more
slowly and not subject to the same conditions.
   Sourrouille told a news conference Sunday the loans would make
available a $500 million ``bridge loan'' promised by the United
States and other governments through the Bank for International
Settlements.
   The money would help Argentina out while it is negotiating for
$1.2 billion more from the International Monetary Fund. A fund
mission has been negotiating in Buenos Aires, and Sourrouille said
he hoped to finish the negotiations soon. Argentina is also
negotiating with the commercial banks, to which more than $42
billion of its debt is owed. The market is dubious about the value
of these loans. In March of this year, some of them were selling
for 28 cents on the dollar.
   Sourrouille said he expected to be able to pay half the annual
interest due from Argentina's own resources. He did not say where
the rest would come from.
   The World Bank offers aid for economic development programs to
developing nations with enormous debt. The International Monetary
Fund, its sister organization, has spearheaded a program of
financial aid to those countries.

<HEAD>WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.: raise taxes.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Lehrer: Your time is up, too. A follow-up, John.
   Mashek: Mr. Vice President, you have vowed not to raise taxes of
any kind during your administration. And at the same time, you've
proposed this capital gains cut, you've proposed more incentive
breaks for the oil industry, you've suggested new spending programs.
   And even some Republicans say a flexible freeze you just spoke
about will hardly make a dent in the deficit. Is the deficit no
longer really a concern of yours, the Republican Party, or the
taxpayers?
   Bush: I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring
it down.
   And presidential leadership, that I want to provide in this
area, will bring it down.
   But, we've got to get the Democrats' Congress under control.
They do all the spending. They appropriate every dime and tell us
how to spend every dime.
   I'd like to ask the governor to join me in getting for the
president what 43 governors have _ the line-item veto.
   He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget
proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment.
   But, the dynamics of the economy _ we cut the taxes and revenues
are up by 25 percent in three years.
   So the problem is, it's not that the working man is being taxed
too little, or the person working _ the woman working in some
factory being taxed too little _ it is that we are continuing to
spend too much.
   So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation, permit the
president to set the priorities on where we do this spending, and
remember, the federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one
year, in 1987.
   And if we _ and actually, this year, Congress is doing a little
better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up
something like 4 percent.
   So, it isn't that we're taking too little per taxpayer _ we're
spending too much still.
   And the formula I've given you works.
   We've put it through a good economic model.
   We've got good economists on the West Coast _ Michael Boskin and
Marty Feldstein up there, who's a very respected economist in the _
Massachusetts _ and they agree that if we can do what I've said, we
can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer
once again.
   And capital gains _ one more point on that. Please, let's learn
from history, a capital gains differential will increase jobs,
increase risk taking, increase revenues to the federal government.

<HEAD>Germany Thanks Iran for Helping Free Hostage, Iran News Agency
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West Germany thanked Iran for helping
secure the release of its last citizen held hostage in Lebanon and
urged Tehran to use its influence to free other foreign captives,
Iran's news agency said Sunday.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani received two messages from West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, expressing
appreciation for efforts Iran made to free businessman Rudolf
Cordes on Sept. 12.
   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Kohl and Genscher
``expressed hope that more hostages now in Lebanon would be
released through Iran's mediation.''
   It quoted Genscher as saying West Germany was willing to
``expand'' bilateral relations with Iran, but gave no further
details.
   Cordes, 55, an executive for the giant Hoechst pharmaceutical
company, was kidnapped in Beirut on Jan. 17, 1987, by a group
calling itself the Revolutionary Justice Organization.
   The group is believed headed by Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, a Shiite
Moslem whose two younger brothers, Mohammed and Abbas, are jailed
in Germany on terrorist charges.
   In a statement the day of Cordes' release, the group said it was
freeing the captive after Iranian and Syrian intervention.
   Mohammed Hamadi, 24, is being tried in West Germany for air
piracy and murder in connection with the 1985 hijack of a TWA
jetliner to Beirut. A U.S. Navy diver, Robert Stethem, was killed
during the 17-day ordeal.
   Abbas Hamadi, 29, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in April
after he was convicted of kidnapping Cordes and another German,
Alfred Schmidt, apparently seeking to force the release for
Mohammed Hamadi.
   Alfred Schmidt, an engineer, was released in September 1987,
nine months after his abduction.
   There are 17 foreigners still missing in Lebanon, including nine
Americans.

   Lehrer: Governor, you have a minute to rebut.
   Dukakis: Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are
watching us, listening to us, and trying to make up their minds
about which one of us ought to be president of the United States,
listen to the vice president very carefully.
   What he's proposing, after over a trillion dollars in new debt
which has been added to the federal debt, in the course of the past
eight years, an IOU that our children and grandchildren will be
paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent of the
people in this country. An average of about $30,000 that we're
going to give to people making $200,000 a year.
   Why, that's more than the average teacher makes. We've had
enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.
   We've run up more debt in the last eight years than under all of
the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.
It's time for a chief executive, who can make tough choices, can
work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to
build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.
   Lehrer: All right, the next question will be asked by Anne
Groer, and it will go to the vice president. You have two minutes
to answer, sir.
   Groer: Mr. Vice President, you've said you want a kinder,
gentler presidency. One that helps the less fortunate. Today, 37
million Americans, including many working families with aging
parents and young children, cannot afford any health insurance _
but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. What will you do to
provide protection for them, and how will you pay for it?

   Bush: One thing I will not do, is sock every business in the
country, and thus, throw some people out of work.
   I want to keep this economic recovery going, more Americans at
work today than at any time in history, a greater percentage of the
workforce.
   What I will do, is permit people to buy into Medicaid.
   I believe that's the answer.
   I am proud to have been part of an administration that passed
the first catastrophic health bill.
   And in that, there's some Medicaid provisions that will be very
helpful to the kind of people we're talking about here.
   But, we've got to keep going forward without killing off the
engine, and throwing people out of work.
   So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the
catastrophic program.
   It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid, so people at the
lowest end can buy in there, and get their needs covered, and then
it _ also, I do not want to see us mandate across the board that
every company has to do this.
   Because I really think that marginal operators are going to go
say, ``We can't make it,'' and I think, then, you're going to see
that people are put out of work.
   All of these programs, and the cost on his was _ I saw an
estimate _ I'd love to know what he thinks _ $35, $40 billion, and
it seems to me that somebody pays that.
   There isn't any such thing as something free out there.
   It either gets passed along as increased prices, or it gets
passed along by people being put out of work so the business can
continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid
system.
   I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the
catastrophic health insurance.
   I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do
out of conscience.
   It's a terrible problem in terms of the _ in terms of
flexibility on private insurances. But, I just don't want to
mandate it and risk putting this _ setting recovery back.
   Lehrer: A rebuttal, governor.
   Dukakis: But, George, that's no answer. You know, last _
   Bush: You don't like the answer, but it was an answer.
   Dukakis: Well, no. It's no answer to those 37 million people,
most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of
health insurance, and don't know how to pay the bills if the kids
get sick at night.
   I was in Houston on Tuesday, meeting with a group of good
citizens, working citizens, all of them with little or no health
insurance. One of them was a father who had been laid off a few
months ago and lost his health insurance.
   He has a 11 year old son, and can't let that son compete in
sports in Little League because he's afraid he's going to get hurt
and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills.
   My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for
universal health care, and we did it with the support of the
business community, and labor, and the health care community, and
with virtually everybody in the state.
   The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring
their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for
those who aren't. And I think it's time that when you get a job in
this country it came with health insurance.
   That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for
all of the citizens in this country of ours.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Michael Dukakis, stopping short of
declaring himself a winner in his first debate with George Bush,
said Sunday that it had been a ``good night'' and ``a good debate.''
   After the 90-minute, nationally televised confrontation, Dukakis
told a rally of hundreds of cheering supporters, ``The message
tonight that we were able to convey ... was that the Democratic
Party and the Democratic ticket are prepared to provide leadership
on the real challenges that face this country and the real concerns
of Americans all over this country.''
   ``This is going to be a tough, competitive stretch drive,'' he
said. ``With your help and your support, we're going to do it.
   ``Let's go out and win this one _ win it for America.''
   Asked by reporters if he won the debate, Dukakis said, ``People
seemed to be pretty enthusiastic.''
   But what did he think? ``I enjoyed it. I thought it was a good
night.''
   ``It was a good debate,'' he said.
   His family and aides were more enthusiastic.
   ``Great. Just wonderful,'' responded Dukakis' wife, Kitty, to
questions about how the debate went.
   ``Spectacular,'' said long-time aide Nick Mitropoulos.
   Dukakis was greeted by supporters earlier Sunday at the
Winston-Salem airport, then drove straight to Wait Chapel on the
Wake Forest University campus to look over the stage and setting
for the debate, the first of two between the presidential
candidates.
   ``The American people will benefit from this debate,'' he said
in brief remarks at the airport.
   ``It's long overdue,'' he said. ``It's time we had a
face-to-face debate and this is going to be a good one.
   ``Once that debate is over, we move forward in the final stretch
of this long marathon.''
   Accompanying him on the flight was John Sasso, the former
Dukakis campaign manager who resigned under pressure last fall but
returned as vice chairman last month. It was Sasso's first campaign
trip with the candidate since his return.
   Sasso is credited with helping Dukakis recover from a
late-summer slump.
   Also along were Dukakis' wife, Kitty, their three children and
the nominee's cousin, actress Olympia Dukakis.
   Theodore Sorensen, senior adviser to the Dukakis campaign, said
the debate will work to Dukakis' advantage because it will make him
better known to the voters.
   Interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
Sorensen, a former White House aide to President Kennedy, said
Dukakis will win the election if it is decided on issues. ``Tonight
he will have a chance to talk directly to 100 million people about
the issues,'' Sorensen said.
   After holding the first of two scheduled debates with Bush,
Dukakis leaves Monday for a week-long campaign swing to the big
Northern industrial states he must win if he is to be elected Nov.
8. He is to arrive in California, the biggest prize of all, at
week's end.
   His first stop Monday was downtown Cleveland, a Democratic
stronghold in Ohio. He planned later appearances in New Jersey,
Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York.
   The governor spent much of the last week preparing for the
debate. Aides set up a mock television studio in a Boston hotel,
across the street from his national campaign headquarters, where
stand-ins for Bush helped him rehearse.
   Democratic visitors offered him advice through the week included
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ George Bush drew a long ``o-o-o-h''
from the presidential debate audience Sunday night after
questioning Michael Dukakis' use of the term phony ``or some one of
these marvelous Boston adjectives'' to describe the Reagan
administration's foreign policy.
   The audience appeared to have interpreted the remark as a
regional slur, based on the view that Boston and its environs are
home to excessively liberal politicians and ideas.
   ``Several Bostonians don't like it,'' Bush said in reponse to
the sound from the audience, ``But the rest of the country will
understand.''

   The National Transportation Safety Board has
identified problems that lead to train wrecks, but the Federal
Railroad Administration has not done anything about it, leading to
hundreds of deaths and millions of dollars in property damage, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   Critics of the FRA contend the agency is using economic
deregulation of the nation's railroads as an excuse to deregulate
safety, and the rail accident rate may be climbing as a result, The
Pittsburgh Press reported Sunday.
   ``We certainly get the impression of a cozy relationship between
the top echelons of those who are supposed to do the regulating and
the railroads themselves,'' said Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio,
chairman of the House transportation and hazardous materials
subcommittee.
   A nine-month investigation by the newspaper revealed that the
FRA usually does nothing more than simply inform railroads that
they've broken safety laws.
   Fines are rarely imposed and often are bargained down to 50
cents on the dollar. Accident reports usually are based on the
railroad's own findings because the FRA doesn't investigate most
accidents, the newspaper said.
   FRA Administrator John Riley, however, said, ``99 percent of all
safety violation reports result in fines.'' He has cited declining
accident rates in the rail industry in defending his agency against
criticism of its enforcement, The Press said.
   ``The bottom line is that the situation has gotten safer,
considerably safer,'' Riley told the newspaper.
   The FRA investigates about 10 percent of all the nation's
railroad accidents. The agency's statistics on accidents are
largely compiled from the railroad's own accounts, the newspaper
said.
   Many safety experts believe that because the FRA is lax in
enforcing safety rules, railroads are even more likely to ignore
widespread problems with track signals and other mechanical
equipment reported by their own workers, the Press said.
   ``It's a remnant of a bygone era, when railroads regulated
themselves,'' Luken said. ``We have found very little enthusiasm in
the FRA for enforcement or ferreting out or correcting problems, or
doing detailed investigation,'' he said.
   Railroad employees said they feel the FRA sometimes is too close
to management.
   ``We take our problems to the FRA and the first thing they want
to know is your name,'' said Wayne Geist, an Amtrak engineer.
``They promise anonymity, but the next day the railroad knows all
about it and then the trouble really starts,'' Geist said.
   Some of the agency's own investigators were among its strongest
critics. An informal Press survey of 31 FRA investigators and
supervisors in 13 states found a high level of frustration at the
obstacles they face as they try to make railroads comply with the
law.
   Riley blamed the discontent on his men being overworked from
responding to major accidents.
   State rail safety investigators, who also work under FRA
guidance, express similar frustrations with the agency, however,
the newspaper said.
   ``We are controlled by the FRA's rules and how it interprets
those rules,'' said Donald Rugh, rail safety inspector for the Ohio
Public Utility Commission.
   ``They have got some really good people out in the field, but
they're governed by the same philosophy: Don't cause any waves,
don't rock the boat, make it look good, but don't push too hard,''
Rugh said.
   No matter how bad a defect, ``We can't put any equipment out of
service,'' said Dave Whanger, a rail safety inspector for the West
Virginia Public Utility Commission.
   ``We can fine the railroad if they don't fix it, but it's up to
them to stop using it.'' Whanger said.

   Ailing Emperor Hirohito lost more blood one week
after falling seriously ill with internal hemorrhaging, but
officials said Monday the 87-year-old monarch remained in stable
condition.
   Government spokesman Keizo Obuchi, the chief cabinet secretary,
said Hirohito watched his favorite sport, sumo wrestling, on
television Sunday. ``But he showed no signs of fatigue today as a
result.''
   Nearly 800 people waited outside the palace early Monday and
signed registries wishing the monarch well.
   Kenji Maeda, general affairs head of the Imperial Household
Agency, said that while the Hirohito was in stable condition and
fully conscious, ``he discharged slight traces of blood from Sunday
night until Monday morning.''
   Maeda said doctors were prepared to give more blood transfusions
Monday.
   Obuchi said: ``His overall condition (Monday) is the same as
yesterday's ... it's stable.''
   The emperor's temperature was 98.1 Monday, down from 98.6 Sunday
night but still well above his normal reading of around 95.9,
according to the palace.
   Despite upbeat reports by government and palace officials,
shares fell as the Tokyo Stock Exchange opened Monday due to
concern over the emperor's condition, traders said.
   On Sunday, thousands of well-wishers braved thunderstorms and
cold rain to throng the gates of the moated Imperial Palace in
central Tokyo under a sea of bright umbrellas. Palace officials say
300,000 have signed their names in a dozen registries set up
nationwide to pray for Hirohito's recovery.
   Hirohito has sat on Japan's Chrysanthemum Throne for nearly 62
years.
   Under the Constitution, the emperor has no political power but
signs documents already approved by the government and serves as a
symbol of Japan's unity.
   The Imperial Household Agency said Hirohito viewed the final
matches of the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament on television. A noted
fan of the ancient wrestling sport, the emperor watched grand
champion Chiyonofuji claim his 25th tournament title with a 15-0
record and commented, ``A perfect victory, isn't it.''
   Meanwhile, television stations replaced comedy and variety
programs with more sedate documentaries out of deference to the
monarch.
   A stream of imperial relatives continued to arrive to pay
respects at his bedside. Crown Prince Akihito, who assumed all his
father's official duties Thursday, arrived from his nearby palace
with his wife, Princess Michiko.
   Two of Akihito's children, Prince Hiro, 28, and 19-year-old
Princess Nori, spoke briefly with their grandfather, and Hirohito's
three daughters also paid visits, the palace said.
   ``I was anxious about his health, but I feel better now that I
was able to speak with him,'' his daughter Takako Shimazu told
reporters.
   The emperor was running a slight fever of 98.6 F in the evening,
Maeda told a press conference. The level, although down from its
peak Saturday, was still above his normal temperature of 95.9.
   Court physicians administered .85 pints in blood transfusions,
bringing the total since last Monday to 5.53 pints.
   They also injected platelets to thicken Hirohito's blood, which
was thinning from the frequent transfusions and making it more
difficult to stop the bleeding, doctors said.
   The emperor's pulse rate was 80 and his blood pressure 140 over
68, Maeda said.

   Lehrer: Follow up, Anne.
   Groer: Yes. Since your Massachusetts health plan has been
attacked by the vice president and you have defended it in this
way, I'd like to move on to perhaps one of the most costly medical
catastrophies facing Americans today and that is AIDS.
   At the end of September, the _ thousands of AIDS patients will
lose their access to AZT, which is the only federally approved drug
for treatment of the disease.
   Now, I'd like to know, sir if _ what your position is on
extending that, and what it is that do you think the government
ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to
people who are suffering from this disease?
   Dukakis: Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your
question that I didn't know that the vice president had attacked
our program in Massachusetts; I hope he hasn't, because it has won
the support of agreat many people all over the state, and I think
it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.
   But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he, or one of his
spokesman, called it socialized medicine.
   The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he
remembers it _ don't you? It was in 1964 and that's what he called
Medicare. Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.
   (Applause.)
   Lehrer: If I may _
   Dukakis: Let me also _
   Lehrer: Excuse me, governor. If I may interrupt at this point
and caution the audience, as I did before we went on the air:
please, hold it down. You're only taking time away from your
candidate when you do that. Governor, continue, please.
   Dukakis: Let me say this about AIDS: It's the single most
important public health crisis, single most important public health
emergency we've had in our lifetimes.
   And I think there are a number of things we have to do,
including supporting legislation which is now moving through the
Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a
cure, which will provide broad education and prevention, which will
provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.
   I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility, and I think the
FDA is attempting to do so now, in trying to make it possible for
new and experimental drugs to be available to the people who are at
risk at AIDS.
   And I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to
bear beginning in January.
   And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with
that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done
carefully and responsibly.
   But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.
   In this particular area, I think the vice president and I are in
general agreement on what we have to do.
   The special federal commission made good, solid recommendations.
I think we're both supportive of them. And I would strongly lead in
that area, as I have in my state, as governor.
   Lehrer: Mr. Vice President, a minute rebuttal.
   Bush: Well, we're on the right track. The NIH is doing a good
job in research. The surgeon general is doing a good job in
encouraging the proper kind of education.
   I noticed that the governor did not mention any testing, but
we've got to have a knowledge base. Testing should be confidential,
but we have to have a knowledge base. We can't simply stick our
heads in the sands in terms of testing.
   I'm chairman of the president's Task Force on Regulatory Relief,
and we are working with the FDA, and they have sped up bringing
drugs to market that can help.
   And you've got to be careful here, because there's a safety
factor. But I think these things _ and then, also, I am one who
believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean _ being sure that
that blood supply is, is pure.
   We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it
comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.
   So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood
supply, are very important elements of this.
   Lehrer: Next question will be asked by Peter Jennings. It goes
to the governor.
   Jennings: Good evening, Mr. Vice President, governor.
   Dukakis: Peter.
   Jennings: Governor, one theme that _ theme that keeps coming up
about the way you govern _ you have both mentioned leadership
tonight, so I'd like to stay with that for a second. The theme that
keeps coming up about the way you govern is: passionless,
technocratic.
   Dukakis: Passionless?
   Jennings: Passionless, technocratic _ the smartest clerk in the
world. Your critics maintain that in the 1960s your public passion
was not the war in Vietnam or civil rights, but no-fault auto
insurance.
   They say that in the 1970s, you played virtually no role in the
painful busing crisis in Boston. Given the fact that a president
must, sometimes, lead by sheer inspiration and passion, we need to
know if this is a fair portrait of your governing, or is it a
stereotype?

<TEXT>
   And if it isn't fair, can you give us an example of where you
have had that passion and leadership that sometimes a president
needs?
   Dukakis: Peter, I care deeply about people, all people, working
people, working families, people all over this country who in some
cases are living from paycheck to paycheck, in other cases they're
having a hard time opening up the door of college opportunity to
their children, in other cases don't have basic health insurance
which for most of us we accept as a matter of course, assuming
we're going to have and we're going to pay the bills we incur when
we get sick, and somebody who believes deeply in genuine
opportunity for every single citizen in this country. And that's
the kind of passion that I brought to my state.
   I was a leader in the civil rights movement in my state and in
my legislature. I cared very deeply about that war in Vietnam. I
thought it was a mistake. I thought it was wrong, and I was one of
the few legislators early in that war that took a stand against the
war. I think it was the right stand at the time, and I think
history has proved us to be correct.
   But I have learned over time. I served one term, I was defeated
as you know and defeat sometimes is an important lesson. I think
I'm a much better governor today. I think I'm a much better person,
a much better listener. I think I'll be a much better president for
having gone through that experience.
   But the things that we've done in my state to bring opportunity
to people on public assistance: over 50,000 families on welfare
that we've helped to move from welfare to work and to become
productive citizens; the universal health care bill that we've just
talked about which will guarantee health care for all of our
citizens; the opening up of opportunities to minorities in my
state, affirmative action, minority contracting; the fact that we
have a 3 percent unemployment rate and more jobs than people to
fill them which gives us a tremendous opportunity to reach out to
everybody and make them a part of this wonderful nation of ours
with the opportunity that we create.
   These are things that I believe in very, very deeply. I may be a
little calmer than some about it. I may be a greater
consensus-builder these days than I used to be and I think that's a
good thing. But I'm running for the presidency of the United
States. I've been in public service for 25 years, because I believe
deeply in American goals and values and the people of this country
and that's the kind of president I want to be.

   Lehrer: Mr. Vice President, a rebuttal.
   Bush: Well, I don't question his passion. I question _ and I
don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam. He introduced
or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids from
Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.
Now, that's a certain passion, but in my view it's misguided
passion.
   He _ we have a big difference on issues. You see, last year in
the primary, he expressed his passion.
   He said, ``I am a strong, liberal Democrat'' _ August, '87.
   Then he said, ``I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.''
   That was what he said. He is out there on, out of the
mainstream. He is very passionate. My argument with the governor
is, do we want this country to go that far left? And I wish we had
time to let me explain. But I salute him for his passion. We just
have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in
what direction it ought to go.
   Lehrer: Peter, a question for the vice president, Peter.
   Jennings: I'd just like to follow up, if I may, on this mention
you've made of his card-carrying membership in the American Civil
Liberties Union. Now, you've used the phrase ``card-carrying'' so
many times, since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a
card-carrying member of the ACLU, that some people, some people
have come to believe that you have used it in, to brand him in some
way, to identify him as people were identified in the 1950s, as
less than patriotic.
   I'd like to know why you keep repeating the phrase. What's the
important issue here? What is so wrong with the governor being a
member of an organization which has come to the defense of, among
other people, Col. Oliver North?
   Bush: Nothing's wrong with it, but just take a look at the
positions of the, just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.
   But Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me
talking about liberal.
   They do not like it when I say that he says he's a card-carrying
member. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it right
here.
   I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him
an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.
   But I don't agree with a lot of the, most of the positions of
the ACLU. I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies, I don't
want my 10-year-old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.

   Partisans on each side declared their man the winner in Sunday
night's debate, with one Democratic senator saying Michael Dukakis
won on the basis of ``moments of spontaneity'' but a Republican
senator saying Bush successfully ``fended him off.''
   ``I think George Bush won. Dukakis had to do well, and I think
this will clearly be the opportunity Michael Dukakis lost,'' Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato said in New York. ``The vice president has fended
him off.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, interviewed at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem, N.C., where the debate was held, said:
``The moments of spontaneity were what distinguished Michael
Dukakis tonight. ... The real winner was the American people, but
Michael Dukakis outperformed George Bush tonight.''
   Former presidential-primary rivals of the two nominees also
picked winners along party lines.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``Dukakis won decisively in
terms of picking up political support. He came across as assured,
confident and clear on the facts. ... Bush seemed befuddled and
confused.''
   But Sen. Bob Dole, the top-ranking Republican in the Senate as
well as a former presidential candidate, said, ``George Bush had a
mission and he can say mission accomplished. He documented again
and again that Mike Dukakis is a Ted Kennedy Massachusetts liberal
_ and that means someone who's out of step with mainstream
America.''
   Pat Robertson, the former television evangelist defeated by Bush
last spring, said, ``On the important issues of taxation, strong
defense and law and order, George Bush was a clear winner.''
   Minnesota State Auditor Arne Carlson, the highest-ranking
Republican in that state, said neither candidate lost ground since
``nobody made a mistake, nobody offended anyone.''
   But other elected officials were not shy about declaring their
party's standard-bearer the victor.
   Democratic New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said in a statement
released by his office,. ``Governor Dukakis clearly advanced his
campaign dramatically. He appeared knowledgeable, decisive, cool,
presidential. He won.''
   Another prominent Democrat, Ann Richards, the Texas state
treasurer and keynote speaker at the Democratic convention last
July, claimed similarly that Dukakis ``looked presidential.'' She
added, ``I thought Bush visibly lost his temper, which is a no-no
in a debate.''
   However, fellow Texan Phil Gramm, a Republican senator, said,
``I believe that George Bush came across as more personable, more
likable. I thought Dukakis was especially weak on foreign policy
and defense. ... I believe George Bush did what he had to do to win
the election. He came across as being more of a leader and more of
a real person.''
   Another Republican senator, Orrin Hatch of Utah, said both
candidates did well in the debate, ``but in my opinion Bush really
laid him out and for the first time he really branded Dukakis as
the liberal he really is.''
   Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the Democratic leader in the
Senate, said, ``Tonight we saw a leader emerge and it was Michael
Dukakis. I think the polls will show that the American people
thought the same way.''
   Some non-officeholders based their analysis on style.
   ``Both of them were obviously very well coached,'' said
psychologist Joyce Brothers. ``Dukakis' use of hands was better. I
had much more of a sense of relaxation from Bush and that is a
plus. I think it was a very close debate.''
   ``Dukakis did much better when the camera caught him
accidentally. He is the master of the ironic smile,'' she said.
``Bush was caught making notes, like a professor. That's a minus.
But Bush is the better master of the pause. Dukakis licks his lips
too much, which is a minus.''
   Lillian Glass, a speech consultant who is author of ``Talk to
Win,'' said Dukakis ``came across a lot weaker than Bush.''
   ``Bush looks presidential, but he needs to hold his head up
straighter,'' she said. ``He made impressive recovery when he made
an error. It made a big difference for him to drop his voice. The
wimp factor is finally gone.''
   Not all observers wanted emotion.
   ``I think there's too much emotion and passion in politics and
what we need is more rationality and articulateness,'' said Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. It was Dukakis, he said, whose answers
``were the most articulate and in-depth.''
   At the same time, Pell said ``I thought the whole debate was
pretty mundane.''
   California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, another Democrat,
agreed, ``It was rather boring.'' Still, he said, Dukakis
demonstrated ``that he was equal if not superior to Mr. Bush on
defense and he was clearly superior on domestic programs.''
   But Delaware Gov. Michael Castle, chairman of the Republican
Governors' Association, said Bush came off as ``more caring.''
   ``Clearly Mike Dukakis was painted as being even more liberal
than the Bush campaign has been painting him so far,'' said Castle,
at the Southern Governors' Conference in Sea Island, Ga.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, another Republican at the conference,
said Bush ``held the advantage he had going into the debate.'' He
said Dukakis ``had to go there and slay a dragon, and clearly he
didn't.''
   Two Democrats at the Sea Island conference saw it differently.
   ``The first round was won by Governor Dukakis. It was not a
knockout but clearly in my judgment a sound decision,'' said
Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles. ``Dukakis was more in command of
the facts, more articulate ... and looked presidential.''
   Gov. Ned McWherter, D-Tenn., said Dukakis ``showed the American
people that he can hold his footing with George Bush _ after all
George Bush is vice president of the United States.''

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ As Sunday night's presidential debate
ended, campaign partisans fanned out with reaction designed to
portray their candidate in the best possible light _ and make the
other guy look like he failed the first real test in the White
House race.
   The word predictable comes to mind, but here is a taste of what
political pundits have come to call ``spin,'' as in, putting your
spin on the story:

   ``One way you would not describe George Bush tonight was
presidential,'' said Tom Donilon, a Washington lawyer who
coordinated Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' debate preparations.

   ``I thought he (Dukakis) would try to show somewhat more
warmth,'' said former Reagan administration official Richard G.
Darman, who played Dukakis in mock debates this past week with
Republican candidate George Bush.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRO-DUKAKIS SPIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis adviser Frank Greer, who worked with Dukakis on
projecting a more human image, said his candidate ``did everything
that he needed to do and a lot more.'' He said Dukakis showed a
human side by talking about the Little League and his immigrant
parents.
   ``He laughed,'' at himself and at Bush, Greer said. ``He engaged
George Bush more than George Bush engaged him.''

<HEAD>PRO-BUSH SPIN</HEAD>

   The candidates still had not delivered their final summations
when Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker unburdened himself thus:
   The debate, he said, ``really did reinforce the differences
we've been talking about, the fact that he (Dukakis) is out of the
political mainstream on a whole host of areas: on taxes, spending,
national spending, the traditional values issues, of ACLU,
furlough, death penalty and the pledge.''

   And even in commenting on Bush's stumbles, Baker managed a dig
at Dukakis, a former instructor at Harvard.
   ``The vice president is not a Harvard professor. What you saw
tonight was a debate between an en experienced leaders, a man with
significant federal experience and a Harvard professor,'' Baker
said.

   I like those rating systems. I don't think they're right to try
to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church. I don't
want to see their kiddie pornographic laws repealed. I don't want
to see ``under God'' come out from our currency. Now, these are all
positions of the ACLU. And I don't agree with them.
   He has every right to exercise his passion as what he said: a
strong, progressive liberal. I don't agree with that. I come from a
very different point of view. And I think I'm more in touch with
the mainstream of America. They raised the same thing with me on
the Pledge of Allegiance. You see, I'd have found a way to sign
that bill. Governor Thompson of Illinois did. I'm not questioning
his patriotism. He goes out and says, ``The man is questioning my
patriotism.'' And, then all the liberal columnists join in. I am
not. I am questioning his judgment on these matters. Or where he's
coming from. He has every right to do it. But, I believe that's not
what the American people want.
   And, when he said, when he said at the convention, ``ideology
doesn't matter, just competence,'' he was moving away from his own
record, from what his passion has been over the years. And that's
all I'm trying to do is put it in focus. And I hope people don't
think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he, use his
words to describe his participation in that organization.
   Lehrer: Governor, response?
   Dukakis: Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to
say this. Of course, the vice president is questioning my
patriotism. I don't think there's any question about that. And I
resent it, I resent it.
   My parents came to this country as immigrants. They taught me
that this was the greatest country in the world. I'm in public
service because I love this country. I believe in it. And nobody's
going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now
repeatedly. The fact of the matter is that if the Pledge of
Allegiance was the acid test of one's patriotism, the vice
president's been the presiding officer in the United States Senate
for the past 7{ years. To the best of my knowledge, he's never once
suggested that the session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of
Allegiance.
   Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism. When you were
attacked for your military record, I immediately said that it was
inappopriate. It had no place in this campaign and I rejected it.
And I would hope that, from this point on, we get to the issues
that affect the vast majority of Americans: jobs, schools, health
care, housing, the environment.
   Those are the concerns of the people who are watching us
tonight; not labels that we attach to each other, questions about
each other's patriotism and loyalty.
   Lehrer: Time is up, governor. Let's go now to John Mashek again.
A question for the vice president.
   Mashek: Mr. Vice President, in a debate during the Republican
primaries, you said most of the nation's homeless are suffering
from mental illness _ an assertion immediately challenged by one of
your rivals. Estimates of the homeless range from a low of 250,000
by the government, to around 3 million, including working families
and their children. What commitment are you willing to make tonight
to this voiceless segment of our society?
   Bush: I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded. I believe
that that would help in terms of shelter. I want to see, when I
talked at our, at our convention about a thousand points of light,
I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and
organizations that help. The governor's wife, been very active in
the homeless, and my, my campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's
wife.
   This isn't government. These are people that care, that are
trying to give of themselves. The government has a role. It is to
fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain Army bases that the
act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people
when it's rough.
   And so, I think that we're on the right track. I don't see this
incidentally as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or a
conservative idea. I see an involvement by a thousand points of
light. I see the funding that is required. And I hope the Congress
will fully fund this bill. They gave it a great deal of conscience
and a great deal of work. And we're on the right track on this one.
   But, and I, look, mental _ that was a little overstated it. I'd
say around 30 percent. And I think maybe we could look back over
our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all of those
mental patients out. Maybe we need to do a better job in mental
clinics to help _ help them, because there is a major problem
there. A lot of them are mentally sick, and we've got to attend to
them.
   But fully, my, my short-range answer is, fully fund that
McKinney Act.
   Lehrer: Governor, a response.
   Dukakis: Well, this is another fundamental difference that I
have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health
care for 37 million members of working families in this country who
don't have health insurance.
   The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on
our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and
moderate income. And when you do that, you have homeless families.
We didn't have 2{ million or 3 million homeless people living on
streets and in doorways in this country 10 years ago.
   We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and
rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in
this country _ housing for young families that they can look
forward someday to buy. We've got communities in this country
increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the
communities that they grew up in. That's an essential commitment,
and I think the housing community is ready. But it's going to take
a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in
building and rehabilitating housing, who understands that
affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for
young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the
American dream.
   And while I'm all for the McKinney Bill, that by itself simply
won't do. We've got to have a president that can lead on this
issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so.
This is one of the most important priorities that faces this
country.
   Lehrer: John, a question for the governor.
   Mashek: Governor, you've mentioned the American dream of home
ownership, and it's certainly become an impossible one for many of
the young people of our nation, who are caught up in this
``economic squeeze of the middle class,'' as you've said so
frequently during the campaign.
   And yet, in spite of your answer just a few minutes ago, what
promise can you realistically hold out to these people that, with
the costs of housing going up and with the limited help available
from Washington? Are we destined to become a nation of renters?

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ George Bush said Sunday night that he
had hoped for a ``little friendlier an evening'' with Michael
Dukakis but that their often cantankerous debate reinforced the
differences between the two presidential campaigns.
   At a rally afterward, Bush assessed his debate performance with
repeated thumbs-up signs.
   ``It is my firm belief that we had an opportunity to speak out
my dreams and my objectives and I am not going to let this man move
to the center and try to get away from his past,'' Bush told
400-500 flag-waving and cow bell-ringing supporters.
   ``We had a great opportunity tonight to spell out some of the
differences,'' Bush said. ``But that was for tonight. Starting
tomorrow on to Tennessee and across the South and up into the
Midwest.,''
   The Republican presidential nominee begins a four-day tour
through those regions, beginning with a rally Monday in Jackson,
Tenn., with running mate Dan Quayle.
   James A. Baker, Bush's campaign chairman, said the debate
``really did reinforce the differences we've been talking about,
the fact that he (Dukakis) is out of the political mainstream on a
whole host of areas.''
   Predictably, he called Bush the clear winner. ``We also think we
won the battle of one-liners,'' Baker joked.
   In one of those one-liners, Bush said, ``I'd hoped this had been
a little friendlier an evening. I'd wanted to hitchhike a ride home
in his tank with him (Dukakis).''
   Several hundred well wishers stood in misty rain at the local
airport to welcome the vice president after his flight from
Washington. Bush shook hands, posed for pictures and kissed a baby.
   Before settling in for last-minute preparations, Bush went to
Wait Chapel on the Wake Forest University campus to familiarize
himself with the debate setting.
   Describing what he wanted to accomplish, the Republican nominee
told reporters during the flight: ``Victory. ... I want to win. But
I don't know how you judge it.''
   His wife, Barbara, interrupted and said, ``I'll tell you if you
won or not.''
   Asked if he felt it was the most important day of his political
career, Bush replied, ``No. Second most important. The Election
Day's the most important.''
   Bush, ``determined to relax'' before the debate, jogged eight
laps on a quarter-mile track in 17 minutes, 52 seconds.
   Asked if he were worried about his meeting with Dukakis, Bush
replied, ``No. I would have been. It's funny but really I feel less
strain than I did in a couple of our other debates.''
   ``I mean I know it's important and I'm not just saying that but
for some reason, I really do (feel less strain),'' the vice
president said.
   ``I know it's as important probably as the convention speech but
a certain tranquility has come over me,'' he added. ``It doesn't
mean that the adrenalin's not going to flow, or hasn't already
started. Just get back to fundamentals. Do your best.''
   Bush arrived here with a team of media and political advisers,
including former Sen. John Tower of Texas, pollster Robert Teeter,
New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, television strategist Roger Ailes
and campaign aides Lee Atwater and Stu Spencer.
   Bush spent most of the week preparing for the debate, poring
over briefing books and holding two mock debates.
   He said the preparations were not as intense, ``not as
cramming,'' as some in the past. ``I feel more comfortable with the
issues, positions and being able to spell them out in a reasonable
period of time.''
   On the flight from Washington, Bush's press secretary, Sheila
Tate, showed off a copy of his horoscope for the day, as given by
Sydney Omarr in The Washington Post.
   ``Burden is lifted, green light flashes for special assignment,
journey. You'll deal with persons in power positions, views will be
vindicated, personal relationship is again harmonious.''

<TEXT>
   Dukakis: Well, I certainly hope not, and it's all a question of
what our priorities are. Mr. Bush talked about values; I agree with
him. What are our values? Isn't providing housing for families of
low and moderate income, isn't it making it possible for young
families, first time home buyers, to own their own home someday,
something that's part of the American dream? I think so.
   You know, back after World War II, when we had hundreds of
thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around,
we went out and built housing. The government was very much
involved, so was the housing industry, so was the banking industy,
so were housing advocates, so were non-profit agencies, so were
governors and mayors, and people all over this country who believed
deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.
   Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as
president of the United States. This isn't a question of a little
charity to the homeless; this is question of organizing the housing
community.
   I've talked to bankers, and builders and developers, to housing
advocates, to community development agencies, and they want
leadership from Washington. Washington by itself can't do it all.
We shouldn't expect that. But governors are ready, mayors are
ready, builders and community leaders are ready. It will require
some funds, John, and we ought to be prepared to provide those
funds.
   But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to
spend billions and trillions on ``Star Wars.'' Well, that's a
choice we have to make, isn't it? Do we spend money on that weapon
system in the billions and trillions? Or is providing some decent
and affordable housing for families of this country something that
isn't at least as important, and probably more so because it's so
essential to our economic strength and to our future.
   Now that's the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to
say, ``Well, the McKinney bill will do it'' just doesn't do. We
need a president who will lead on this issue, who's had experience
on this issue. It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of
our list beginning in January of 1989.
   Lehrer: A response, Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.
Let's talk about housing, which the question was.
   When you talked to those bankers, did they discuss where
interest rates were when your party controlled the White House? Ten
days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21.5
percent. Now how does that grab you for increasing housing? Housing
is up. We are serving a million more families now.
   But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic liberal way
of trying to build more bricks and mortars. Go out and take a look
at St. Louis at some of that effort; it is wrong. I favor home
ownership, I want to see more vouchers, I want to see tenant
control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest
rates down. They're half now of what they were when we came into
office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control,
they'll be a lot less.
   But if we spend, and spend, and spend that is going to wrap up
the housing market and we'll go right back to the days of the
misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome,
thank God for the United States on that one.
   Lehrer: All right, the next question is to the governor. Anne
Groer will ask it.
   Groer: Governor Dukakis, is there a conflict between your
opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on
demand, even though in the minds of many people that's also killing?
   Dukakis: No, I don't think there is. There are two very
different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.
I'm opposed to the death penalty. I think everybody knows that. I'm
also very tough on violent crime. And that's one of the reasons why
my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in
America. It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate
of any industrial state in the country. It's one of the reasons why
we have a drug education and prevention program, that is reaching
out and helping youngsters all over our state _ the kind of thing I
want to do as president of the United States.
   You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death
penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a
federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the
country, and which gave, last year, 7,000 furloughs to drug
traffickers and drug pushers _ the same people that he says he now
wants to execute.
   The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I
think we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I
don't favor abortion. I don't think it's a good thing. I don't
think most people do. The question is, who makes the decision? And
I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own
conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.
   Lehrer: A response, Mr. Vice President.
   Bush: Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique. It
was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had
not served enough time to be eligible for parole. The federal
program doesn't do that. No other state programs do that. And
therefore, and I, I favor the death penalty.
   I know it's tough, and honest people can disagree. But when a
narcotics wrapped-up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I
think they ought to pay with their life. And I do believe it would
be inhibiting. And so, I am not going to furlough men like Willie
Horton, and I would meet with the victims of his last escapade, the
rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.
   Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was
furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be
furloughed again. And so, we have a fundamental difference on this
one.

   The United States has notified Kuwait and other
friendly nations in the Persian Gulf that it is prepared to ease
the convoy protection the U.S. Navy is giving oil tankers, a State
Department official said Sunday.
   The Pentagon still plans to keep warships in the troubled
waterway to protect neutral shipping vessels from attack, the
official said.
   The 14-month convoy program involved a precise Navy formation to
protect Kuwaiti tankers that had been re-registered under the U.S.
flag against potential Iranian attack.
   Pentagon officials said last week that if the plan is finalized,
U.S. warships would keep U.S.-flagged tankers within a ``defensive
zone'' that would place the ships under constant surveillance.
   The plan would allow a slight reduction in the number of U.S.
ships in the gulf, perhaps by one, the Pentagon officials said,
speaking on condition they not be identified. The United States has
26 ships in its Joint Task Force Middle East, including 17 inside
the Persian Gulf itself. As of Sept. 16, the Navy had conducted 85
convoy operations since the summer of 1987, when escorts began.
   Pentagon spokesman Maj. David Super said Sunday night he had no
information on the convoy situation.
   Navy warships still will be ``close by'' and able to respond,
the State Department official said. ``It is definitely not pulling
out.''
   However, revised orders are near completion to drop the convoy
procession without a substantial cutback in U.S. firepower, said
the official, speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   He called it a ``slight change in configuration'' and said a
final decision had not been taken yet, pending thorough
consultations with the gulf countries.
   The official said the reason for the planned change in orders
was that there had been no attack on merchant tankers in the gulf
for at least two months as the United Nations attempts to implement
a cease-fire in the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.
   President Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
participating this week in the special session of the U.N. General
Assembly, are expected to reinforce efforts by Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to end the war that has claimed an
estimated 1 million casaulties.
   Reagan and Shultz strongly supported U.S. intevention on behalf
of free shipping against critics who feared the United States might
be drawn into the conflict. During the course of the convoy
operation, U.S. warships were engaged in a number of firefights
with Iranian vessels, but did not engage in the Iran-Iraq war
itself.

   NASA postponed the start of the
countdown for space shuttle Discovery by eight hours Sunday because
of lagging preparations, but still aimed for a Thursday morning
liftoff.
   ``We're still on the timeline for launch on the 29th and that's
the plan,'' said launch director Bob Sieck.
   The countdown was rescheduled to begin at 8 a.m. EDT Monday for
the first manned American space flight since the Challenger blew up
over the Atlantic 32 months ago.
   The space agency had added 27 unprogrammed hours to the
countdown as insurance for last-minute problems, and Sieck said
eight hours of that time would be used in advance to complete the
work of replacing panels and work platforms.

   June Scobee says she will watch the liftoff of
Discovery on television because her presence at the launch site
``would just remind everyone'' of the shuttle disaster that killed
her husband and six other crew members.
   Mrs. Scobee has not been back to Cape Canaveral, Fla., since
that chilly morning of Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger exploded
73 seconds after launch.
   Now Mrs. Scobee, whose husband, Dick, commanded the ill-fated
ship, said that ``like any other American citizen'' she is eager
for a successful Discovery mission to get NASA's manned spaceflight
program back on track.
   None of the other Challenger families will attend Thursday's
launch from the Kennedy Space Center, and Mrs. Scobee said some
have not even decided whether they will watch on TV.

   Billy Carter, the former ``first brother''
and beer-drinking good ol' boy whose candor and business ventures
amused and sometimes embarrassed the Carter administration, died
Sunday of cancer. He was 51.
   The brother of former President Jimmy Carter suffered for a year
with pancreatic cancer _ the disease that killed his father and a
sister _ and lived longer than his doctors expected. He died three
days after leaving the hospital for his home in this southwest
Georgia hamlet.
   Carter ``died quietly and peacefully in his sleep ... with his
family at his bedside,'' according to a statement issued by the
Carter Presidential Center on behalf of the former president and
his family.
   ``He had struggled courageously with his illness, never losing
his sense of humor and always more concerned about those who loved
him than about himself,'' the family said.

   Emperor Hirohito lay in serious condition Sunday
but was alert enough to watch the finals of the autumn sumo
tournament on television, and a daughter who paid a bedside visit
expressed optimism about his health.
   Thousands of well-wishers braved thunderstorms and cold rain to
throng the gates of the moated Imperial Palace in central Tokyo
under a sea of bright umbrellas. Palace officials say 300,000 have
signed their names in a dozen registries set up nationwide to pray
for Hirohito's recovery.
   The 87-year-old monarch remained under intensive,
round-the-clock care by a team of court doctors after vomiting
blood from an intestinal hemorrhage on Monday. The emperor has sat
on Japan's Chrysanthemum Throne for nearly 62 years.

   The dream of creating room-temperature
superconductors is impossible unless scientists come up with
materials different from those they are now developing, new studies
suggest.
   Superconductors transmit electricity without resistance. Various
copper oxides are now the best superconductors under development
but have so far worked only if chilled to at least 234 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit.
   Commercially available superconductors must be kept much colder
with liquid helium, an expensive and cumbersome process.
   Researchers believe that if they can create room-temperature
superconductors, it may be feasible to build faster, smaller
computers; cheaper, super-efficient power transmission lines; 300
mph trains that float above tracks, and extraordinarily powerful
magnets to help produce electricity from nuclear fusion.

   The Rev. Barbara C. Harris, elected the
first woman bishop in the Anglican Communion's 450-year history,
said Sunday her elevation is the latest step in a movement to bring
the church into the mainstream.
   Ms. Harris, 58, a former public relations executive, was elected
Saturday to the position of suffragan, or assistant, bishop for the
eastern Massachusetts diocese of the Episcopal Church. The diocese,
which includes Boston, is the nation's largest in both geography
and population.
   ``A fresh wind is blowing across this church of ours,'' she said
in her first sermon at Philadelphia's Church of the Advocate since
her election.
   Several elections earlier this year show the church is changing,
said Ms. Harris, who is black. Two black priests were elected
coadjutor bishops, who are first in line to succeed their presiding
bishops, without first serving as assistants.

   Social initiatives from welfare to child care
are hanging in the balance as Congress draws toward adjournment,
increasingly impatient and preoccupied with presidential politics.
   In a year of rhetoric about the American family, lawmakers have
yet to complete action on major initiatives to raise the minimum
wage, expand and improve child care, reform the welfare system and
guarantee leave to workers with pressing family responsibilities.
   A number of appropriations bills, including one providing about
$300 billion for the Defense Department, have been approved in some
form, but differences remain between the House and Senate versions.
   Also on the incomplete roster is the biggest environmental bill
of the 100th Congress, a revision of the Clean Air Act to
strengthen the battle against urban air pollution, acid rain and
airborne toxic substances.

   Trees, forest upon forest of them, are being
advanced as one of mankind's best friends for future efforts to
combat global overheating from the ``greenhouse effect.''
   Right now, however, trees represent one of the Earth's worst
enemies.
   Left alone, trees are storage ``sinks'' that consume large
quantities of carbon dioxide, the worst of the greenhouse gases
that scientists say are collecting in the atmosphere and trapping
heat that once escaped into space.
   But a tree felled by a logger or consumed by fire is doubly
dangerous: not only will it no longer consume carbon dioxide, its
death releases stored carbon dioxide to join the atmospheric
accumulation that scientists say will produce major global climate
changes in the 21st century.

   A long-awaited study being released this week
could dramatically change the way doctors are paid, sharply
reducing fees for many kinds of operations while raising charges
for office visits.
   The study has been the object of intense speculation and
apprehension in the medical world since it was undertaken 2{ years
ago by economist William C. Hsiao of the Harvard University School
of Public Health.
   The massive project attempts to determine the amount of work
involved in everything doctors do _ from checkups and well-baby
visits to brain surgery and coronary bypasses _ so they can be paid
what their services are worth.
   There is widespread agreement, Hsiao said, ``that the current
payment system is unworkable. The fees are distorted and
inequitable.''

   Hundreds of people gathered Sunday in an unusual
officially sanctioned rally to commemorate the Nazi massacre of
Jews at a ravine called Babi Yar. But several speakers directed
their anger not at the Germans but the Soviet government.
   ``Babi Yar was a prelude to the spiritual genocide of the Jewish
people of our country,'' Yuri Sokol, a veteran of World War II,
told at least 500 people huddled on a tree-lined road outside the
gates of Moscow's Vostryakov Cemetery.
   A few years ago, police would have broken up such a
demonstration as an anti-Soviet outpouring of nationalism. But
under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness, only a few policemen were on hand and did not interfere.

   Network documentaries, a string of new books,
an all-night Capitol vigil and memorials by former Peace Corps
volunteers and PT boat veterans will help commemorate the 25th
anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November.
   But family members plan a low-profile remembrance, much
different from the 1983 nationally televised observance of the 20th
anniversary of that fateful day in Dallas.
   ``They have tried to get away from commemorating the day of his
death and try to celebrate the day of his birth,'' said Melody
Miller, an aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. The senator and
other family members have said they will not grant interviews.
   Some family members likely will follow tradition and quietly
visit JFK's grave site at the Arlington National Cemetery, while
others join family matriarch Rose Kennedy at her regular daily Mass
at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., said Ms. Miller, a
long-time Kennedy aide who worked for the late Robert F. Kennedy.

   The emergence of rival Christian and
Moslem governments threatens to plunge Lebanon once again into a
civil war fueled by outside powers that long have used the country
as a proxy battlefield.
   The crisis could formalize the de facto partition of Lebanon
into sectarian cantons carved out during the 13-year civil war,
which killed about 150,000 people.
   Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon, backs the Moslem
government and the Shiite Moslem Amal militia. Israel and Iraq
support the right-wing Christians. Libya funds the Druse militia,
which sent volunteers to fight alongside Col. Moammar Gadhafi's
army in Chad.
   Iran arms and bankrolls the Shiite fundamentalists. Saudi Arabia
helps the Sunni Moslems, but fundamentalist Sunnis also look to
Iran for support.

   Cleveland's largest suburb is running ads
telling minorities they are welcome in the nearly all-white
community, but officials say the court-ordered campaign is getting
a lukewarm response.
   Parma launched the advertising campaign in January on orders
from a judge who ruled the middle-class suburb of 92,000 illegally
tried to keep minorities out.
   The public relations effort has included a booklet for
prospective residents, a three-month radio campaign and year-long
advertisements in three local newspapers, including The Call and
Post, a black-oriented weekly.
   The ads proclaim Parma ``welcomes people of all races, religions
and national origins.'' and is an ``interracial community offering
the advantages of a comfortable and stable suburban lifestyle.''
   Parma has spent about $70,000 on the campaign and signed a
$12,000 contract with The Cuyahoga Plan, a countywide fair housing
organization, to answer calls responding to the advertising.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The rebellion in the rank and file
of the 7,000-man army has dramatically reformed the high command,
replacing corrupt and repressive remnants of the Duvalier
dictatorship with competent professionals.
   ``There is a democratic revolution going on in the army. No
decision is made without the enlisted men,'' said Serge Gilles,
co-leader of the Patriotic Unity Bloc, a coalition of three
democratic political parties.
   The army purge began Sept. 17, when enlisted men and their
sergeants ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, the head of government.
They replaced him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who as a brigadier
general had been the army's top administrative officer.

   Rising out of the azure waters like the
Caribbean god of wind, Hurricane Gilbert smashed idyllic resorts
and industrial cities during an eight-day rampage across the
Caribbean and Mexico.
   Gilbert grew into a hurricane with winds of 74 mph on Sept. 10,
100 miles southwest of Puerto Rico, sending the first waves of
torrential rain and panic to impoverished towns in Haiti and the
Dominican Republic.
   By the time Gilbert lost its hurricane status over northeastern
Mexico, it had killed more than 300 people, left hundreds of
thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars damage to the
Caribbean, Central America, Mexico and the United States.
   Gilbert's trail of destruction across nine nations occurred
despite the technological advances of modern-day weather
forecasting. Airplanes flew into the eye of the hurricane several
times daily and meteorologists with computers predicted the storm's
next target.

   Oil ministers from five OPEC nations met
for three hours Sunday at the Indonesian Embassy in an emergency
session to deal with ways to limit production and shore up
international crude prices.
   Sources said the ministers, who comprise the 13-nation cartel's
price monitoring committee, heard a pessimistic account of the
world oil market from Subroto, the organization's Indonesian
secretary general.
   The group did not issue a statement following the gathering,
which included a one-hour formal meeting, according to one OPEC
source.
   ``We heard a long report on the state of the market, which is
not very good,'' said a senior OPEC delegate, who asked not to be
further identified.
   Ministers from the five members of the Price Evolution Committee
_ Nigeria, Algeria, Indonesia, Saudia Arabia and Venezuela _ were
to meet informally for a closed-door dinner at the Saudi Arabian
Embassy later Sunday and hold another round of formal discussions
Monday morning.
   The talks, which analysts have predicted would not produce any
dramatic results, are taking place amid a crude oil market slump
that stems largely from a production spurt by nations in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The committee cannot take any binding decisions on its own, but
can recommend that a full meeting of the organization be called
before its scheduled fall session scheduled on Nov. 21 in Vienna,
to consider ways to stem production and shore up international
crude prices.
   The Paris-based International Energy Agency says OPEC was
producing 19 million barrels a day in August, considerably over the
15.06-million-barrel ceiling the group had agreed to for the period
from June through the end of the year. That quota did not include
production by OPEC member Iran.
   Oil prices have hit their lowest levels since the summer of
1986, when they fell below $10 a barrel.
   North Sea Brent crude was quoted at $13.30 a barrel on Friday,
up slightly from the beginning of the week in the wake of news of
the two-day meeting. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
November contract for the benchmark grade of U.S. crude fell 47
cents to $14.18 a barrel on Friday.
   According to analysts, at issue in the talks is the failure of
nearly all OPEC members to respect production quotas established in
an attempt to maintain the price of oil at $18 a barrel.
   OPEC Chairman and Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman, who is
attending the Madrid meeting, said last week in Indonesia the group
would examine overproduction and cooperation between OPEC and
non-OPEC producers.
   Algeria has complained to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers
that failure to respect the quotas is causing serious hardships for
other OPEC members whose economies are dependent on oil revenue.
   Since the last price committee meeting Aug. 3 in Lausanne,
Switzerland, a cease-fire in the eight-year Gulf War between Iran
and Iraq has begun to hold. Both nations reportedly have stepped up
production to earn more money for carrying out massive
reconstruction projects.
   During Sunday's meeting, Subroto welcomed Venezuela's new oil
minister Julio Cesar Gil to his first formal OPEC event.
   In addition to Lukman and Gil, oil ministers attending the
meeting are Algeria's Belkacem Nabi, Indonesia's Ginandjar
Kartasasmita and Saudi Arabia's Hishan Nazer.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.
