   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis said Thursday the Reagan administration has ``walked away
from the American dream'' with policies to help the rich at the
expense of working people.
   ``I'm running for president because during the past seven years
I've seen too many people thrown out into the streets after decades
on the job. ... I've talked to too many local leaders who've seen
their communities become ghost towns of boarded up hopes and
foreclosed dreams,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   His speech at Serb Hall, a traditional rallying spot for
presidential hopefuls in Wisconsin, came with polls suggesting
Dukakis is in a virtual dead heat with Jesse Jackson heading into
Tuesday's primary.
   Jackson has been making a strong pitch in Wisconsin to
blue-collar workers, asking them to support him as he supported
striking meatpackers and paperworkers as well as Kenosha
autoworkers about to lose their jobs because of a plant closing.
   While hitting hard at the Reagan administration, Dukakis
refrained from criticizing other Democratic candidates. One day
earlier, he had spoken in general terms of his differences with
Jackson and then had criticized Gore for demanding he be more
specific.
   At a news conference after the speech, Dukakis, responding to
questions, said he felt he was better qualified than Jackson to be
president because of his experience as a governor of Massachusetts.
But he stopped well short of criticizing Jackson.
   Dukakis also called for the resignation of Attorney General
Edwin Meese III.
   Asked why he felt he was better qualified than Jackson, Dukakis
said: ``I think I am going to be a better president because I think
I have the strength, the experience and the values to lead this
country, because I am somebody who not only believes in good jobs
and good wages for people, I've helped to create them.''
   In his speech, Dukakis reserved his criticism for the Reagan
White House.
   ``This administration has walked away from the American dream,''
Dukakis said Thursday. ``They've walked away from the basic
contract that says if you work hard and pay your taxes and live
within the law, you have a right to a good job; and the right to a
life where you don't have to go to bed every night worried about
whether that job will still be there in the morning.''
   Dukakis said the Reagan administration has done nothing to move
people from welfare to jobs, to fight adult illiteracy, to preserve
good-paying jobs or to provide adequate health care to the needy.
   He said he is running for president ``because I believe that
every American should have a house _ not a slab of concrete or a
heating grate _ that they can call home.''
   Dukakis also promised what he called a real war on drug and
alcohol dependency and asked, ``How can we tell our children to say
no to drugs when this administration can't say no to one of the
largest drug peddlers in this hemisphere?'' _ an apparent reference
to Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.

   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. defended his
criticism of rival Jesse Jackson on Thursday and took issue with
Michael Dukakis for being ``afraid to say a single word about Jesse
Jackson.'' Later, he called for the removal of Attorney General
Edwin Meese.
   At a Florida fundraiser, Gore said the attorney general should
step down because it is ``time to remove the cloud over the
Department of Justice.''
   ``How long will it take this administration to understand the
importance of integrity in government?'' Gore asked a crowd at the
posh Grove Isle resort. ``We cannot tolerate a situation where the
nation's chief law enforcement officer is constantly testifying as
a suspect before grand juries, constantly operating under a cloud
of suspicion.''
   The Tennessee senator pointed to the departure of top Justice
Department officials and reports that they had quit because they
believed Meese was hurting the department by staying on.
   ``President Reagan and Vice President Bush say, `Oh, it's no bid
deal. There are resignations all the time.' What insensitivity!
What contempt for the American people!'' said Gore.
   The Gore campaign raised about $108,000 at the Florida event,
said Mitchell Berger, one of the organizers.
   Earlier, Gore commented after a Capitol Hill celebration marking
his 40th birthday, an event that came as a relief to the candidate
who has grown weary of answering questions about running for
president while still in his 30s.
   ``Forty makes all the difference,'' he said.
   Gore reacted to questions at a news conference about his remarks
on Monday in New York, when he criticized Jackson as without
experience and said he was dismayed by the candidate's associations
with PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   Gore said that by his criticism he was holding Jackson, the
civil rights activist, to the same standard as other candidates.
   ``I've said exactly the same thing I've said over the last year,
and all of a sudden it's a big deal,'' Gore said. ``Well, the only
reason it seems to some people like a big deal is that Mike Dukakis
is afraid to say a single word about Jesse Jackson.''
   Dukakis, however, began cautiously speaking of differences
between himself and Jackson on the Middle East and domestic policy
on Wednesday. Dukakis said ``from time to time differences will
arise ... and those will come out over time.''
   Dukakis and Jackson have won the most Democratic delegates so
far, with Gore in third place.
   The Tennesse senator spoke to reporters in the sunshine in front
of the Capitol after joining in a birthday celebration in a Senate
office building.
   ``You know, Jack Benny was perpetually 39,'' Gore said. ``I've
been doing a kind of reverse Jack Benny in this campaign _ I've
been trying to turn 40.''
   Gore planned to spend the next four days campaigning in
Wisconsin before Tuesday's primary there.
   His campaign began airing a new television ad in that state
attacking Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca for closing the
Chrysler assembly plant in Kenosha. It shows Gore stating that
Iacocca was paid $20 million in 1986. ``I'll make these
corporations pay their share of the taxes and create jobs here in
America,'' Gore said in the ad.
   Gore was asked about his criticism of Jackson a day after his
rival said Gore's comments amounted to a personal attack and
canceled a meeting between the two. Gore called that
characterization ridiculous, and he faulted Dukakis for what he
termed a ``ludicrous'' hesitancy to engage Jackson in debate or
criticism.
   Gore is still trying to restart his campaign in the North, where
he has failed to duplicate his Southern success _ or even to
register in double-digits in the Illinois primary and Michigan
caucuses.
   He reacted strongly when asked by a questioner whether he has
been privately encouraged to rop out of the presidential race in
order to stop splitting the white vote _ a question that suggested
Jackson was profiting by the battle between Gore and Dukakis.
   Gore said the ``question has a racial if not racist premise.''
He said he had not been so urged and called it inappropriate to
talk about such racial divisions.

   Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond met Thursday
with Attorney General Edwin Meese III and expressed ``deep
concern'' on behalf of Congress about problems at the Justice
Department in the wake of the resignations of two of Meese's top
aides.
   Meese's meeting with Thurmond, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Judiciary Committee, was the strongest signal to date of
growing bipartisan concern in Congress over whether the attorney
general, the focus of an 11-month criminal investigation, can
continue to run the Justice Department.
   ``A number of people on Capitol Hill have expressed deep concern
about the problems at the Justice Department,'' Thurmond said in a
statement after the meeting. ``I went today to talk to the attorney
general to convey these concerns to him.''
   Minutes after the meeting, Meese refused to answer reporters'
questions about the resignations when he attended a news conference
at FBI headquarters on a drug bust.
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in Friday's editions that
Solicitor General Charles Fried, the Justice Department's
fourth-ranking official, this week urged Meese to resign but was
rebuffed.
   According to the newspaper, Fried told Meese in a meeting
Wednesday that the attorney general's legal problems were creating
turmoil within the department.
   After the meeting, Meese said he hoped and expected that the
solicitor general would stay on. Department officials told the
Times that Fried had stressed that he was making no judgment on
whether Meese was guilty of a crime. They said Fried told Meese
that the mounting dispute over his leadership and ethical standards
was hindering the department's work.
   ``Charles feels strongly that Meese has to go for the good of
the department,'' one official told the Times.
   Fried, reached at home Thursday night by The Associated Press,
refused to discuss any aspect of the story.
   ``I'm not going to comment on that,'' he said.
   The Times also reported that Lewis F. Powell Jr., the retired
Supreme Court justice, said Fried called him Monday evening ``very
upset and concerned, and very perplexed about what he should do.''
   Meese, who said Wednesday ``there's no reason'' for him to
resign, said he would answer questions on the resignations of his
aides ``within the next several days'' when ``I hope and I fully
expect ... to be announcing various appointments to fill those
vacancies.''
   ``The business of law enforcement is going forward energetically
and without interrupton,'' Meese said. ``Our strong management team
is on the job.''
   The attorney general, a longtime confidant of President Reagan,
stood somberly next FBI Director William Sessions as the FBI chief
praised Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney
General William Weld, who quit Tuesday because they felt Meese's
continuing legal troubles were hurting Justice Department
operations.
   ``I think they're very fine gentlemen, served their government
well, are to be commended for the service that they performed,''
Sessions said when asked about Burns and Weld, who oversaw all
federal criminal investigations.
   Meese, in response to a reporter's question, said he had no
plans to meet with Thurmond later in the day, neglecting to mention
that he had already done so.
   After the news conference and after Thurmond already had issued
his statement, Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland issued a
clarifying statement confirming that the meeting had occurred
before the news conference.
   Thurmond said at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee meeting in the
morning that he wouldn't ``countenance any corruption in any way,
shape or form in the Justice Department or any other department.''
   The Washington Post reported Thursday, and Justice Department
sources subsequently confirmed, that Weld had told Meese during a
meeting Tuesday that the criminal investigation of the attorney
general was a close call in terms of whether the attorney general
should be prosecuted.
   Weld went on to say that if he were the independent counsel
investigating Meese, he would present the case to a grand jury
seeking indictment, according to the sources, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Thursday that Reagan should meet
with Weld and then reconsider whether Meese should stay on the job.
Specter said Weld's reported remarks require a presidential inquiry
and decision.
   On Wednesday, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said flatly that Meese
should resign. Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West
Virginia also called for his resignation, saying Meese was ``the
crown jewel of the sleaze factor in Reagan administration history.''
   Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., told reporters Thursday that if
Meese encounters difficulty in finding capable replacements for
Burns and Weld and there is evidence the department is not
functioning well, and ``he ought to step aside.''
   But Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the Senate's deputy GOP leader,
said he was ``appalled'' at the hue and cry over Meese.
   ``They've never laid a glove on him yet,'' Simpson said, adding
there is no indication Meese is guilty of anything.
   Nancy Reagan's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said reports
that the first lady was campaigning for Meese's removal were
``absolutely not true.''
   ``She hasn't talked to anyone and no one has talked to her about
the issue,'' Mrs. Crispen said by telephone from Los Angeles, where
Mrs. Reagan was visiting before joining the president at their
California ranch Friday for an Easter vacation.
   The criminal investigation of Meese launched last May 11 by
independent counsel James McKay is continuing, and so far has
delved into his involvement through longtime friend E. Robert
Wallach with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a proposed $1
billion Iraqi pipeline project.
   A partner in the pipeline project, Swiss financier Bruce
Rappaport, had been scheduled to give a deposition about the case
to McKay last month but backed out and has apparently decided not
to cooperate with the investigation, The Washington Post reported
in Friday's editions.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in Washington and
abroad, said Rappaport was scheduled to give sworn testimony at a
meeting in London with McKay and his aides but changed his mind at
the last minute because he was afraid he might not remember
everything accurately.
   Rappaport was to have been given immunity from prosecution in
the case.
   McKay widened the probe this week by subpoenaing payroll records
and other documents of the Washington chapter of the Multiple
Sclerosis Society in connection with a $40,000-a-year job Meese's
wife, Ursula, got with the charity in 1985. Investigators are
examining Wallach's role in helping Mrs. Meese get the job.

<HEAD>Comets Not Unaltered Relics of Solar System's Birth, Analysis
Suggests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comets do not deserve a reputation as pure
samples of material from the birth of the solar system, because
they have been altered in deep space, suggests an analysis
published today.
   Heat from very bright stars and star explosions called
supernovae has altered their characteristics, researchers from the
University of Colorado at Boulder propose.
   ``There's no such thing as a pristine comet,'' said J. Michael
Shull, who presented the analysis with colleague S. Alan Stern in
today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   Comets are essentially dirty snowballs that formed at the birth
of the solar system. Scientists study them for clues to the
conditions surrounding the formation of the sun and planets.
   Trillions of comets are thought to orbit the sun some 10,000 to
100,000 times as far away as the Earth's orbit, Shull said. Those
comets have never been seen, but astronomers do spot comets that
have left that orbit and swung in toward the sun.
   While still in their distant orbits, the analysis contends, the
comets have been heated to differing extents by passing stars and
by supernova explosions. That caused boiling that obliterated the
original structure and chemical composition of the comet surfaces,
the analysis says.
   Paul Feldman, professor of physics and astronomy at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, called the proposal intriguing.
   Comets that return to view on a regular schedule have certainly
been heated and modified by repeated trips near the sun, he said,
but comets making their first trip to the inner solar system are
thought to contain pristine material.
   ``Their hypothesis is not likely to be easily tested by remote
observations from the ground or from earth-orbiting observatories,
but will await future missions to comets which can actually measure
the composition and structure of the ice directly'' he said.

<HEAD>Kenyan Ex-President's Nephew Fined $5,000 In Pot Importation
Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nephew of Kenya's founding president has
been fined $5,000 and credited for time served for his role in a
1,900-pound marijuana importation conspiracy.
   ``For your greed, you ... have failed your government and
certainly your family,'' U.S. District Judge Alfred M. Wolin said
Wednesday in sentencing Samuel Muigai, 36, nephew of Kenya's first
president Jomo Kenyatta.
   Muigai walked away a free man after paying the fine and serving
more than five months in jail since his arrest in October on
charges of conspiring to import the marijuana. Three co-defendants
were sentenced to prison.
   Muigai pleaded guilty to conspiring to import an unspecified
quantity of the drug, which carries a maximum term of five years in
prison.
   Wolin, who sentenced two Kenyan co-defendants to six years in
prison and a third to nine years for their guilty pleas, found that
Muigai played a ``truly passive'' role ``limited to greed,'' in the
scheme.
   A fifth Kenyan, millionaire arms dealer and land developer
Stephen Mwangi, 49, was found innocent after a trial earlier this
month. A Ugandan defendant, Mpigi Kabasha Mbogo, 39, is to be
sentenced Monday.
   The six men were arrested after they traveled to Gloucester
City, where the pot had just arrived aboard a ship. They were to be
paid $1 million in the deal, negotiated through undercover agents
in telephone calls to Kenya.
   Though Muigai's crime was an ``affront to the people of the
United States,'' Wolin said he was satisfied Muigai was remorseful
and had learned a ``bitter lesson.'' He also took note that Muigai
was the first to plead guilty.
   Muigai, dressed in a gray pin-stripped suit and white loafers,
apologized for his involvement in what he called an ``unfortunate
incident.''
   ``I would like to assure you, sir, that I don't intend and I
don't think I will ever stand in another court of law for charges
of any sort of criminal activity,'' he told the judge.
   Muiga's his attorneys argued that Muigai's co-defendants invited
him to meet with wealthy American businessmen interested in
developing some of his property.
   Even after learning the discussions with the ``businessmen,''
who turned out to be federal agents, concerned marijuana, Muigai
went along, hoping still to discuss the land deal, the court papers
said.
   The stiffest sentence, nine years, went to Steven Thuku, who
Wolin determined was the principal in the deal for making the
contacts with the sources of the marijuana and the other defendants.
   Wolin found that Geoffrey M. Tumbo, 45, and Daniel M. Githegi,
36, had less culpability and gave them six-year prison terms.
   They pleaded guilty to conspiring to import more than 110 pounds
of marijuana, a charge carrying a 20-year maximum penalty.

<HEAD>Meese Friend: Should Have Been More Sensitive To Appearance Of
Impropriety</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 2nd graf to show that interview published Thursday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III's friend
E. Robert Wallach says he should have been more sensitive to an
appearance of impropriety in helping Meese set up a financial
partnership with an investment manager who wound up on the board of
Wedtech Corp.
   In an interview published Thursday in the San Jose (Calif.)
Mercury News, Wallach said that he ``missed the boat completely''
on the potential conflict of interest in linking Meese with the
investment manager, W. Franklyn Chinn of San Francisco in May 1985.
   Meese knew at the time that Chinn was doing work for Wedtech.
Chinn subsequently become a member of Wedtech board of directors.
   Wallach and Chinn were indicted in December on racketeering
charges for allegedly extracting payments from Wedtech as part of a
scheme to influence Meese and other public officials to assist the
defense contractor.
   In 1981 and 1982, Wallach wrote Meese a dozen memos urging the
then-White House counselor's support for the Bronx, N.Y. defense
contractor. Meese interceded on Wedtech's behalf in connection with
the company's efforts to get a $32 million no-bid contract to build
small engines for the army. Wedtech ended up wining the contract in
1982.
   ``I just missed the boat completely on the Wedtech connection,''
Wallach said, referring to the potential for a conflict of
interest. ``Wedtech at the time was just an irrelevancy.
   ``I knew that my memos (to Meese) had had nothing to do with the
award of the (Wedtech) contract in 1982. ... We (Wallach and Meese)
were trapped by our own honest conduct. We never thought of
Wedtech. ... Our state of mind in April '85 was, we had not played
a major role in Wedtech.''
   Wallach also insisted that neither he nor Meese was aware of
memos in 1981 and 1982 from then White House counsel Fred Fielding
warning Meese's top deputy and other administration officials not
to intercede in Wedtech's military contract discussions because of
ethical and procedural considerations.
   ``On reflection, a more cautious approach on my part would have
been wise,'' said Wallach. ``A more cautious approach on his
(Meese's) part would have been wise.''
   In the interview with the San Jose newspaper, Wallach also said
Meese had ``nothing absolutely'' to do with a $150,000 payment to
Wallach in 1985 in connection with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline
deal.
   The $150,000 was a legal fee to Wallach by one of his clients,
Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, a partner in the pipeline project.
   The $150,000 wound up in a stock trading account owned by Chinn
and the money was, in effect, pooled with that of other investors,
including Meese, to generate profits in highly speculative stock
trading of brand new stock issues which were bought and sold on the
same day.
   Under this arrangement, Chinn turned a $40,000 profit for Meese
on a $50,000 investment in just 18 months.
   The pooling of money from Chinn's various investors, including
Meese, helped the financial manager obtain the funds to get new
stock issues. It would have been difficult for Chinn to obtain the
new issues of stock with Meese's money alone.
   Wallach said that when all of the facts are known, his and
Chinn's handling of the $150,000 originally paid to Wallach will
emerge as ``the classic bureaucratic error.'' He declined to
elaborate.
   Wallach said the main reason he introduced Meese to Chinn was
because Meese stood to make more money investing with Chinn than
with more conventional institutions.
   ``I probably was influenced disproportionately by Frank's
offering a high return,'' Wallach said.
   ``Should I have been more prudent and recommended him (Meese) to
a more major investment firm?'' Wallach asked. ``In retrospect,
yes.''

   A recent survey shows that while about 70 percent
of U.S. adults indicate they watch television during the evening
hours, only 12 percent said it is their principal activity.
   ``We found that most people are not just simply couch potatoes,
but do a number other things with their free time,'' said Carol
Hess, a research consultant for Lexington-based Decision Research
Corp.
   Most adults reported they combine television viewing with other
activities, such as cooking, cleaning and doing crafts, Hess said
Wednesday.
   The DRC survey, a follow-up to a previous leisure time poll
released last year, asked 1,000 adults during October, November and
December to describe how they spent the previous evening from 5
p.m. to 1 a.m.
   Reading was the second most popular activity, particularly among
older respondents, with 22 percent reporting books or magazines as
part of their evening.
   Men comprised the majority of the 18 percent saying they worked
during the evening, while the 9 percent reporting they shopped were
mostly women, according to the survey.
   Other top activities included dining out, 12 percent; with
sports or exercising, going to a meeting or having sex each noted
by 2 percent of the respondents. One percent went to a movie.
   ``We had a lot of other responses from knitting to spent last
night in jail to skinning a raccoon,'' said Hess.
   Yet only 15 percent rated their evening as ``great,'' with
satisfaction higher among older or married respondents or people
with annual incomes above $50,000.
   The recent survey was launched after DRC researchers last year
found that many respondents felt their leisure time was diminishing.
   ``We thought this was curious considering all the labor-saving
equipment and that, in theory, people have a five-day work week,''
said Hess.
   DRC research, however, indicates that people perceive they have
less leisure time because of the trend toward highly structured
activities outside of work, said Hess.
   ``When I ask you what are your favorite leisure activities, you
might say sailing or something,'' said Hess. ``You are not likely
to say you love going swimming at the health club five mornings a
week, although that is something you chose to do. It's not a
question that people have less leisure time. It's that people are
losing their discretionary time; time that is for myself.''
   Hess noted that the low percentage of inveterate ``couch
potatoes'' suggest people are seeking to gain more control over
their free time.
   ``I think we are looking here at people exercising more freedom
of choice,'' said Hess. ``It shows they can exercise their
discretionary power to pick what gives them pleasure rather than
accepting what's out there in a passive way.''

that forced it to restore his coverage.
   The Maryland insurance commissioner two weeks ago, citing data
that drivers like James are no more likely to crash than drivers
who don't carry radar detectors, threw out Geico Corp.'s rule
against underwriting drivers who own radar detectors.
   It was under that rule that Geico canceled James' policy, but a
trade association called RADAR won him reinstatement and filed a
complaint with state officials.
   ``I've never had an accident,'' said James, 45, who commutes to
work in Washington from suburban Maryland. He said he bought the
detector after speeding unintentionally and getting a ticket. ``I
don't speed anymore, I outgrew that years ago.''
   An estimated 4 million people nationally use radar detectors,
and advocates hope the ruling in Maryland will help keep them legal.
   ``This is the first ruling of its kind in the country,'' said
Janice Lee, president of the Cincinnati-based Radio Association
Defending Airwave Rights Inc., the trade group.
   The devices, which alert drivers that police may be tracking
them by scanning for certain radar frequencies, are illegal in
Virginia, Connecticut and Washington, D.C.
   Legislation to ban the detectors was introduced this year in 12
states and still has a chance of passing in Michigan, New Jersey,
New York, Mississippi and Massachusetts, said Ms. Lee, whose
organization represents about a dozen manufacturers with an
estimated $300 million in yearly sales.
   ``Geico tried to make law, and the commissioner told them they
had to play by everybody else's rules,'' Ms. Lee said.
   The ruling, written by Associate Deputy Insurance Commissioner
Thomas P. Raimondi, criticized Geico's ``vision (of) itself as the
Good Witch of the North who, alone among the 800 property and
casualty insurers, is pointing the magic anti-radar wand of the
good corporate citizen in condemnation of the use of radar devices
by the citizens of this state.''
   Highway safety groups say the detectors ought to be illegal
because they are used primarily to break the law.
   ``Speed is not a function of emotion or economics or politics,''
said Robert W. O'Brien, spokesman for the National Safety Council.
``Speed is a function of physics: The faster you go, the more
likely it is that you'll have an accident.''
   Companies such as State Farm Insurance Co., the nation's largest
auto insurer, and Aetna Insurance Co. said they have no detector
rules because most states recognize the devices as legal.
   Insurers also cited the dearth of direct evidence. The insurance
industry does not know how many accidents or how many claims are
related to detectors, said Harvey Seymour of the industry-funded
Insurance Information Institute.
   ``We oppose speeding and the use of radar detectors. (But) it's
very hard to statistically support that people with radar detectors
have more accidents,'' said Richard Doran, director of automobile
underwriting for Allstate Insurance Co., the nation's
second-largest auto insurer.
   Allstate has concluded that, although it might lose money on
drivers with radar detectors, its data would not support a ban in
court, Doran said.
   ``(Geico's) guideline was a little arbitrary,'' Doran said.
   Geico, based in Washington, D.C., last week failed to win an
injunction against the Maryland order, but says it will appeal in
Baltimore Circuit Court.
   And a study in Texas may show whether speeders are likely to be
using radar detectors.
   The federally financed study by the Texas Transportation
Institute at Texas A&M University is slated for completion late
this year. It will use two radar units to clock car speeds in four
states. One undetectable radar _ using a specially licensed
frequency _ will observe speeds before and after a detectable
signal is turned on.
   Using the same method last year in Maryland and Virginia, the
industry-backed Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that
29 percent of cars going faster than 70 mph, and 19 percent going
66 mph to 70 mph, slowed down abruptly when they encountered the
second radar.
   ``We know the effects of speed, and we know that these (radar
detectors) cause drivers to go faster. Therefore, our conclusion is
that people who use radar detectors would cause higher'' numbers of
fatalities, said John Cook, vice president of the institute.
   Arguing before the commission, Geico used that study and others
to calculate that drivers using detectors are equal to drivers
``with two more more violations and would have 2.41 times as many
accidents.''
   RADAR, on the other hand, cited a survey showing that drivers
using detectors were involved in fewer accidents and were more
likely to wear seat belts than drivers as a whole.

   There are at least four men in New York prisons
who have something in common with a new inmate, Robert Chambers:
They all killed somebody in New York City on Aug. 26, 1986.
   But the similarities end there. Unlike the killer of Jennifer
Levin, they are serving their time in obscurity. No camera-wielding
mobs hounded them when they surrendered, no tabloids splashed their
names in headlines.
   All four cases were in the impoverished South Bronx, uptown from
the grassy spot in Central Park where the former prep school
student killed Miss Levin, from the bar on Manhattan's East Side
patronized by Chambers, Miss Levin and other affluent young people.
   ``It isn't fair,'' said Angel Traverso, 16, a neighbor of one of
the victims, Rosa Dueno, 44. ``They make such a big deal out of
Jennifer Levin's death and Rosa's death means nothing.''
   Chambers, 21, started a five- to 15-year sentence Saturday for
killing Miss Levin, 18, during what he initially called an episode
of ``rough sex.'' The day before, while a jury deliberated murder
charges against him, he pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter.
   Chambers and the other defendants all killed people they knew,
and they were arrested quickly. Three of the four Bronx killers
pleaded guilty after bargaining with prosecutors, as Chambers did.
   But none went through the protracted litigation that Chambers
did, and all but one are serving longer sentences.
   The one who received a lighter term was Ms. Dueno's killer, Juan
Enrique. He had a history of beating Ms. Dueno, who was his
girlfriend, and on Aug. 26, 1986, he stabbed her to death.
   He was never charged with murder. He pleaded guilty to
second-degree manslaughter and was sentenced May 19 to
two-and-a-third to seven years in prison.
   In a city that averages about five homicides a day, the deaths
of Ms. Dueno and the others were largely unnoticed. The disposition
of the cases went unnoticed as well:
   _ Santos Cuello Valdez, charged with second-degree murder for
shooting Daniel Alvarez to death, pleaded guilty last May 14 to
first-degree manslaughter. Justice Elbert Hinkson sentenced him on
June 26 to seven to 21 years in prison.
   _ A grand jury charged Juan Quinones with second-degree murder
in the stabbing of Rachel Pajooh, 48. She allegedly had shot at him
once when he tried to rob her and had reported him to police. After
a non-jury trial, Justice Lawrence Bernstein convicted Quinones of
first-degree manslaughter and sentenced him on Oct. 7, 1987, to 12{
to 25 years in prison.
   _ Ronald Matthews, indicted on a charge of second-degree murder
after he smashed his father's head with a sledgehammer, pleaded
guilty to first-degree manslaughter and was sentenced by Justice
Ivan Warner on Oct. 13 to six to 18 years in prison.
   There is no indication as to whether the families of the victims
were consulted when the guilty pleas were negotiated; prosecutors
gave the Levin family the right to veto their agreement with
Chambers.
   And no news conferences were called when the Bronx cases were
wrapped up.
   Ed McCarthy, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney's
office, said the assistant district attorneys who prosecuted the
cases were not available to discuss them, or to compare them with
the more celebrated case in Manhattan.
   ``It's apples and oranges,'' he said. ``What happened there,
happened there. What happens here, happens here.''

   For $2 or so, you can hungrily cradle a barrel
of popcorn while watching characters in ``Babette's Feast'' ravish
blini with black caviar, quail stuffed with foie gras and other
magnificent morsels in what has to be one of the most inspiring
meals ever shown on the screen.
   For $88 more, you can follow this feast for the eyes with one
for the body.
   ``One thing will happen after you see this movie: You will be
starving,'' said Dro E. Proudian, general manager at Petrossian
Inc., whose restaurant is one of several around the the country
serving the seven-course feast during the run of the movie,
Denmark's entry for an Academy Award as best foreign film.
   ``When you see the film, how complicated the meal is, how
expensive, all the marketing,'' there will be a greater
understanding of the art of preparing a great meal, said Yannick
Cam, chef and owner at Le Pavillion in Washington, which begins
serving the feast in April.
   The movie, based on a story by Isak Dinesen, tells of two
unmarried and pious sisters who take a French political refugee,
Babette, into their home on the bleak coast of Norway, in return
for housekeeping. Fourteen years later, when Babette wins 10,000
francs in the lottery, she repays them with a feast so strange to
them that one sister, in anticipation, compares it to a witch's
sabbath.
   But Babette fills the hearts, as well as the bellies, of her 12
guests, mostly members of the sisters' religious community.
   ``It was a whole experience, that's why we did it,'' said Stella
Geller of West Orange, N.J., who with her husband followed the film
with dinner recently at Petrossian. ``I didn't leave a bite of
anything. I ate every bite.''
   So far, plans have been made for the feast at restaurants in
Philadelphia, Miami, Los Angeles, Washington, San Francisco and
Laguna Niguel, Calif., according to Alfred Rosenthal, Orion
Classics' gastronomic consultant for the dinners. Prices will vary
slightly, with $80 the lowest, without wines, he said.
   That will buy: turtle soup; blini with black caviar; quail
stuffed with foie gras baked in a pastry nest with truffle sauce;
salad; cheeses; rum cake with candied fruit; fresh fruit; coffee.
Add $35 for four wines.
   As the movie opens in more cities, theater owners and
restaurateurs can use a guide written by Rosenthal to help them
present the feast and find such ingredients as turtle meat.
   While the meal is expensive, Proudian called it a bargain,
noting the normal prices of just three ingredients: 30 grams of
fresh Russian Sevruga caviar ($21); 2{ ounces of fresh foie gras
($15); three-quarters of an ounce of black truffle ($30).
   ``The people who come here are adventurous, a lot of romantic
people,'' Proudian said in a recent interview at Petrossian, a
mirrored and marbled restaurant near Carnegie Hall.
   To meet their expectations and recreate the sense of abundance
evident on Babette's table, he said, ``the caviar has to be
heaping, you have to see the truffles, not just a speck here, a
slice there. When you put your knife into the quail, you have to
feel the foie gras.''
   ``It was extraordinarily difficult, because we had to recreate a
visual image on a plate,'' he said.
   Petrossian's chef, Michel Attali, said he encountered one
problem. In the film, the quail is served sitting in its pastry
nest with the head on. Believing that would not be acceptable here,
Attali fashioned pastry ``heads'' for the tiny game birds.
   But no matter how faithful, diners will not experience the same
mood as in the film, Cam said: ``First the house in the film, and
it was a little religious dinner. I don't think we can reproduce
that.''
   Still, Proudian said, ``The star of the movie is the food. So if
you are in this business, it's nice to see all of this dignity and
respect given to the preparation of food.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Reagan and Ortega Battle to a Draw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looks more and more as though President
Reagan will leave office without achieving his stated goal of
making Daniel Ortega say ``Uncle.''
   In the view of many Latin American experts, Reagan's policy of
keeping the pressure on Ortega's Nicaraguan government to bring
about peace and democracy has failed.
   ``You have peace, but you don't have freedom,'' says Neil
Pickett, an expert on national and international security affairs
at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis.
   ``They're about to leave office, and they've got a Contra
program that's falling apart on them,'' says Ed King, Latin
American adviser to Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd.
   As G. Pope Atkins, senior associate specializing in South
American affairs at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, sees it, the stated goal of the policy has kept shifting.
   ``The first one was simply to interdict Nicaraguan arms to El
Salvador,'' Atkins said. ``Then it was rather strongly implied that
the idea was to bring down the regime. And now the idea is that if
they (Nicaragua's leaders) will change, everything will be all
right.''
   Marlin Fitzwater, the president's chief spokesman, says the
administration's goal remains the same: ``The situation is that we
need aid to the Contras in the worst way.''
   But questions remain whether Wednesday's House vote to continue
non-lethal aid and leave the door open for military aid, and the
expected Senate vote today, will help further Reagan's objectives.
   Reagan has said his goal is to keep pressure on the Sandinistas
so they will live up to the promises of democratic reform that they
made when they took over from dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   At a news conference Feb. 21, 1985, Reagan was asked whether he
was advocating the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government. His
reply was: ``Not if the present government would turn around and
... say, `Uncle. All right, come back into the revolutionary
government, and let's straighten this out and institute the
goals.'''
   Now that the two sides have agreed on a cease-fire, will
Nicaragua's Marxist-led Sandinista government reform? And if it
doesn't, can the Contra rebels the Reagan administration has backed
survive as an effective force?
   Many think not.
   ``I think it would be awfully difficult to reorganize them,''
said Atkins. ``I doubt if they would be particularly interested in
that. I don't think they would want to go through the convolutions
of U.S. policy again.''
   King added that ``it's over for the time being unless the
Sandinistas back up on what they say they are going to do, and have
done, and the Contras change their orientation from where they are,
which is: let's get some kind of political opening going.''
   Pickett, too, sees ``the end of the resistance'' in the latest
developments, ``barring some miracle or barring some violation
before the truce is signed.''
   ``If the Sandinistas do something stupid before that, the
Contras can be saved,'' he said.
   King, the adviser to Byrd, said: ``The objective of the whole
exercise in the beginning was to protect U.S. security concerns in
the region. U.S. security concerns in the region are removal of the
Soviet and the Cuban advisers, guarantees of no bases, reduction of
Soviet weapons and guarantees of no border crossing.
   ``Now they are at a point where they don't have any of those
things arranged, they're about to leave office, and they've got a
Contra program that's falling apart on them,'' King said. ``I think
the whole thing is a disaster, frankly.''
   The less partisan sources are not calling it a disaster, but
they aren't proclaiming it a success either.

   Alaska continues to lead the nation in per
capita federal spending, but Virginia is closing in, new federal
figures show.
   The U.S. government spent about $5,421 per resident in Alaska
last year, making it the leading state in per capita spending.
   But second-place Virginia _ which moved up from third a year
earlier _ wasn't far behind at $5,317 per capita, according to the
Census Bureau.
   That $104 per capita difference in spending between the states
was down from a $246 spread in 1986.
   Maryland, which had been second in 1986, dropped to third place
with 1987 spending of $5,113.
   Both Maryland and Virginia benefit from their location adjacent
to the nation's capital. Many federal agencies have offices in the
suburbs, which also are home for consultants and suppliers of goods
for the government.
   If it were a state, the District of Columbia would easily lead
in per capita spending, averaging $23,360.
   Nationwide, federal spending averaged nearly $3,433 per American
last year, about $41 more than the year before.
   The report, ``Federal Expenditures by State for Fiscal Year
1987,'' broke down spending totaling $848 billion, covering
virtually everything except interest on the national debt.
   Direct payments to people was the largest share, totaling $384
billion. That includes Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and
other such programs.
   Buying goods and services was second, with $196 billion spent.
Salaries for federal employees totaled $127 billion, with $108
billion sent out to state and local governments and $33 billion
spent on research grants, agriculture subsidies and various other
purposes.
   Per capita, that amounts to $1,555 paid to individuals; $795 in
procurement; $514 in salaries; $437 in grants to state and local
government and other spending of $133.
   Alaska's top finish included high levels of aid to state and
local governments as well as pay for federal employees, but it was
way down the list in payments to individuals.
   Florida topped that category, with Social Security and Medicare
benefits for its large elderly population raising the state's
average.
   California was easily the leader in total federal spending, with
its large population, military bases and industry helping bring in
$100.7 billion. Even so, the Golden State finished only 14th in per
capita spending.

   Congressional investigators say the Defense
Logistics Agency should tighten controls over its ``fast-pay''
program to avoid paying for supplies that are never delivered.
   According to a General Accounting Office report released today,
one DLA purchasing office failed to take action to ensure
collection of more than $7 million in overpayments.
   ``I'm appalled that DLA is paying money for supplies that it
never received,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who, along with
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., released the GAO report. ``We need
sound business management at DLA.''
   The agency purchases food, clothing, fuel oil and other supplies
for the armed services.
   Under the fast-pay program, the agency pays vendors based on
shipping invoices instead of verifying receipt of the supplies. The
procedure is designed to expedite payments for small purchases.
   ``Internal controls established by the DLA purchasing offices do
not prevent possible fast-pay program abuse,'' said the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress. ``Potential missing depot shipments
are not always detected for timely follow-up and resolution.''
   The GAO said that in 52 fast-pay shipments valued at $71,267 to
the Defense Electronics Supply Center in Dayton, Ohio, the center
could not document the receipt of 16 shipments valued at $18,618.
In addition, the center failed to notify some of the vendors of the
missing shipments within 90 days.
   It also said action had not been taken as of last May to collect
more than $7 million in previously identified overpayments owed the
Defense Personnel Support Center in Philadelphia.
   The GAO also said that vendors with performance problems on
previous contracts have continued to receive fast-pay awards and
that controls have not been established to ensure the receipt of
supplies sent directly from vendors to overseas locations.
   In 1985, the Office of Management and Budget issued instructions
to limit the use of fast pay, saying it should not be used to
replace stocks in depots or when timely payment can be made. The
GAO said DLA believes it is not required to follow the requirements
until they are incorporated into the Federal Acquisition
Regulations.
   However, DLA spokesman Larry Wilson said the agency plans to be
in compliance with the OMB requirements by the end of the year even
though it is expected to cost an additional $2.5 million to process
the extra paperwork.

<HEAD>House Votes To Rehire Some Controllers Fired In 1981</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation calling for the rehiring of 1,000
air traffic controllers fired nearly seven years ago has won strong
approval in the House, although the Senate has yet to consider a
similar bill.
   The Reagan administration has steadfastly refused to rehire any
of the 11,400 controllers who were fired after they walked off
their jobs in 1981. The Transportation Department has urged that
such legislation be vetoed by President Reagan if it clears
Congress.
   The 234-180 House vote Wednesday calling for some of the fired
controllers to return to the Federal Aviation Administration came
two years after similar legislation was defeated by a 193-226
margin.
   Supporters of the legislation argued that there are too few
controllers to handle air traffic needs, especially at some of the
busiest towers and traffic control centers, and that the former
controllers could become fully trained more quickly than trainees
off the street.
   Rep. Guy Molinari, sponsor of the House resolution, said a
selected number of fired controllers should be rehired by the FAA
``for the sake of safety and the convenience of the flying public.''
   ``Today it's clearer than ever that the air traffic control
system is still severely strained,'' Molinari, R-N.Y., said during
floor debate. The legislation calls for selectively hiring 500 of
the fired controllers this year and another 500 next fiscal year.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, has estimated that as many as 6,000 of the 11,400 former
controllers still have an interest in returning to the FAA. Under
the legislation the FAA would be free to select the controllers it
wants to rehire.
   The FAA has steadily been increasing its controller workforce
and now has 14,450 controllers at various experience levels,
compared with 16,375 before the 1981 strike. The Transportation
Department plans to hire another 1,350 over the next 1{ years.
   While support for rehiring at least some of the fired
controllers was widespread, some congressmen continued to have deep
concerns about such a move.
   ``Putting the strikers and their replacements in the same
control tower is sure to create animosity between the two
factions,'' suggested Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark.
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., said the legislastion is ``sending
the wrong message'' to government workers and their unions. ``The
right to fire illegal strikers must not be compromised,'' Solomon
declared.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Witnesses Call For Quicker Action</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is being urged to
lead the industrialized world into new, tougher action against the
chemicals that scientists say are destroying the Earth's
stratospheric ozone layer.
   The call for strict international controls on
chlorofluourocarbons, or CFCs, is coming from senators, scientists
and two quarters that often are in deep disagreement:
environmentalists and chemical companies.
   ``We need a massive diplomatic mission,'' Sen. John Chafee,
R-R.I., said Wednesday as two Environment Committee subcommittees
heard renewed warnings that CFC's are depleting the ozone that
shields humans from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   Committee members and witnesses took turns saying that the
United States must take the lead to push other industrialized
nations into taking stronger measures against CFCs than contained
in last year's Montreal Protocol.
   That agreement could lead to a freeze on global CFC production
in 1999 at a level of 50 percent of the CFCs manufactured in 1986.
To take effect, the protocol needs ratification by nations
representing two-thirds of CFC production. So far, only the United
States and Mexico have acted.
   CFCs are widely used as refrigerants and industrial solvents and
in the production of foam products. They also serve as propellants
in aerosol cans, although such use was banned in the United States
in 1977.
   Witnesses said the administration should not only be pushing for
ratification but also be lobbying for an emergency international
gathering to consider a larger production freeze or even a ban on
CFCs.
   The protocol provides for a CFC review meeting sometime in 1990.
Lee Thomas, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,
said Tuesday he would press to have that meeting very early in 1990.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., called on President Reagan to make an
accelerated schedule for CFC reductions a priority item this June
when he and leaders of other industrialized democracies hold their
annual economic summit.
   Also calling for faster action was Sherwood Rowland, the
University of California-Irvine professor who in the 1970s was one
of the first scientists to warn of dangers posed by CFCs.
   ``Clearly the protocol is not going to do much of anything for
10 years,'' Rowland said. ``We need more rapid action than that.''
   David Doniger, senior attorney for the environmentalist Natural
Resources Defense Council, said a swift international response is
needed in light of the conclusion announced March 15 by a panel of
100 scientists convened by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   The panel said ozone depletion is occurring faster than
previously thought. Doniger said the losses cited by the panel
already are at levels EPA has projected for the year 2050 under the
production cuts specified by the Montreal protocol.
   ``I think we can attain a new worldwide agreement in a year and
end the use of these chemicals by the end of the century,'' Doniger
said.
   Joining the call for a stepped-up diplomatic effort were
representatives of two major U.S. producers of CFCs, E.I. DuPont De
Nemours & Co., and Allied-Signal Inc.
   ``All of us need to work to get as many nations as possible to
ratify the protocol as quickly as possible,'' said Marilyn
Montgomery, vice president and general manager of Allied-Signal's
Genetron Products.
   Elwood Blanchard, DuPont's executive vice president, said his
company believes that CFC-producing countries should be convened as
soon as possible ``to review the scientific findings and to
establish appropriate global responses to these findings.''
   He and Ms. Montgomery said their companies have begun efforts to
develop safe substitutes for CFCs, but neither could say when they
might be available.
   DuPont announced last week it was phasing out production of CFCs.

<HEAD>Coretta King Calls on Congress to Restrict Handgun Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHYLLIS MESSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King says Congress has ``acquiesced too long to the gun
lobby'' and she is urging lawmakers to vote to restrict sales of
handguns.
   Speaking on the seventh anniversary of the shooting of President
Reagan outside a Washington hotel, Coretta Scott King cited the
significantly lower murder statistics from countries that control
handgun sales.
   Such restrictions, she said, ``are more effective than capital
punishment'' in deterring killings. ``We need to end the needless
sacrifices of men, women and children on the altar of congressional
inaction.''
   She later added: ``Congress has acquiesced to the gun lobby. The
only thing that will bring an end to this inaction is an aroused
citizenry.''
   Mrs. King then signed a giant-size petition, sponsored by the
National Coalition to Ban Handguns, that calls for restrictions on
the sale of handguns. She will be honorary chairwoman of the
petition drive along with Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy.
   The petition drive, called ``A Time to Remember, A Time to End
Handgun Violence,'' coincides with the 20th anniversary of the
deaths of King and Kennedy. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968,
and Kennedy on June 6, 1968.
   In a separate statement, Sarah Brady, wife of White House Press
Secretary James Brady, who was wounded in the attack seven years
ago on Reagan, pleaded to Congress for stronger handgun control
laws.
   Mrs. Brady said she supports legislation that would require a
seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases to allow police to
conduct a background check.
   ``I'm firmly convinced that had such a proposal been in effect
seven years ago, John Hinckley would have been prevented from
purchasing the handgun he used to shoot the president, my husband
and two law enforcement officers,'' Mrs. Brady said.
   The National Coalition to Ban Handguns petition does not endorse
any specific piece of legislation. But Michael K. Beard of the
coalition said ``we hope it will stimulate this Congress to enact a
national waiting period requirement before a handgun may be
purchased, to ban the sale of non-detectable (plastic) handguns and
to ban Saturday Night Specials, the kind of handgun used to kill
Robert Kennedy.''

   Audiences seem to know what he means, but Vice
President George Bush doesn't always get the words out exactly
right as he campaigned this week in Wisconsin.
   During an appearance at Lawrence Univeristy in Appleton, Wis.,
the Republican presidential candidate told his audience, ``I want
to be the education president.''
   ``There is a need for help at the federal level ... so you can
afford to send your college to children,'' Bush declared.
   At another time in the same speech, he meant to talk about the
``high cost of college,'' but it came out: ``the high cost of
courage.''
   Speaking to a rally in a Milwaukee suburb, Bush appeared to
invent a new federal tax on farmers, declaring he favored a lower
``capital grains tax.''
   No doubt, he was referring to the capital gains tax. Bush has
urged a partial repeal of the part of the 1987 tax overhaul law
that taxes capital gains _ such as from the sale of a house, stocks
or business assets _ at the same level as other income.
   Bush's verbal tongue-twisting seems to be catching.
   Introducing the vice president at another Milwaukee-area
function, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson asserted: ``As the Reagan
presidency ends, it's time for the Bush pregnancy to begin.''

   As he campaigned in the area, Bush was repeatedly reminded by
local reporters of a previous campaign visit here, when he went to
a Milwaukee bowling alley _ and wound up sprawled on the lane.
Questions like ``Plan to do any bowling this time?'' have abounded.
   ``You have a good memory,'' he told one inqusitor.
   ``I did fall down. But so did nine pins,'' he said in defense of
his technique.

   At an aviation musuem in Oshkosh, Bush was presented with a
brown leather aviator's jacket and he climbed readily into the
cockpit of a 1949 Bearcat fighter.
   The plane was billed as similar to one he had flown as a Navy
pilot during World War II, a past his campaign strategists would
like to have remembered as often as possible.
   Well, it wasn't exactly like the kind of planes he used to fly,
``but it has the same engine,'' Bush said.
   Then Bush, who frequently has posed on and in various kinds of
heavy equipment during his campaign, held his right arm over his
head and flashed a ``V'' sign for photographers.
   ``Is this the Red Baron look?'' he asked.
   Then Bush was led to a full-scale replica of the Voyager, the
lightweight plane that set a record for flying non-stop around the
world.
   ``I'm anxious to learn about this,'' Bush said. ``This looks
like it may be a little tough.''
   He elaborated further. ``There's the inevitable question,'' he
said. ``How does one go to the bathroom?''

   A British mountain climber set off for the

   Bonington and a five-man team discovered 7-inch-by-4-inch
footprints 16,000 feet up the mountain last year. Periodic
sightings of the creature, also known as the yeti, have been
reported for decades.

   The restored presidential yacht USS Sequoia is
making a national tour before being returned once again to the
president of the United States after an 11-year hiatus.
   The Sequoia, which was sold in 1977 by President Carter as part
of an austerity move, has been repaired by a private group. It was
launched Wednesday on a 100-city, 22-state tour that will enable
thousands to see the vessel before it is officially returned to the
White House Nov. 15.
   ``What we have here is a Fourth of July celebration every
weekend in cities throughout the country,'' said Michael McGehee, a
member of the group that raised money to repair the 105-foot yacht.
``We're taking a piece of American history to the American people.''
   Private and corporate funding paid for the Sequoia's
restoration, and Josh Lanier, who chairs the nine-member
Presidential Yacht Trust's board of trustees, hopes the tour will
raise money for an endowment to pay for the ship's upkeep.
   ``This tour is a little like running a campaign,'' he joked.
``We have a good candidate, no opposition, and we're confident she
won't screw up on the evening news.''
   The Sequoia was built in 1925 and sold to the Commerce
Department in 1931. In 1933, after President Hoover wintered on it
in Florida, the Sequoia was acquired by the Navy and became the
president's official yacht.
   Over the next 44 years, the Sequoia served eight presidents. It
was the site of talks on nuclear controls during the Truman
administration, the venue of gala celebrations by President Kennedy
and the place where President Nixon told his family in 1974 that he
would resign the presidency.
   In 1977, as part of a widespread retrenchment program, Carter
directed that the vessel be sold. It was purchased for $286,000 by
a group of private investors.
   Over the next four years, the craft changed hands three times
and began to deteriorate. In 1981, a private trust was established
to purchase and restore the boat.
   After reading news accounts in 1983 about the boat's dilapidated
condition, Lanier, a former aide to Sen. Herman Talmadge, D-Ga.,
joined the effort to refurbish the craft.
   ``I remember thinking it was a crying shame that this boat had
fallen on such bad times, because I remember how it was used in the
Nixon and Ford administrations,'' he said.
   Minor repairs were made, and a little-publicized, 16-state tour
during the summer of 1984 drew surprisingly large crowds.
   ``Everyone told us it was a mistake for the federal government
to have sold the Sequoia,'' Lanier said. ``We then started raising
money for a full restoration, with the intention of returning the
vessel to the office of the president.''
   In June 1986, a six-month, $3.5 million restoration was
completed, and the Sequoia sailed to New York for the Statue of
Liberty centennial celebration. Since then, the Sequoia has been
moored in Washington and used for government functions.
   The Sequoia's tour will include ports in Virginia, South
Carolina and Florida in April, and to Gulf Coast cities in Alabama,
Louisiana and Texas in May. It then will sail up the Mississippi
River in June and July, stopping at ports in Mississippi, Arkansas,
Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois and Michigan.
   After visiting Great Lakes ports in August, the Sequoia will
stop at cities between Boston and Baltimore in September. The tour
will end Oct. 30 in Alexandria, Va.

   A newspaper said vast oil deposits have

the discovery.
   ``It is true that encouraging results have been achieved, but
conclusions drawn by the paper are rather grossly exaggerated,''
Nicholas Biwott said.
   Biwott issued a statement Wednesday after the Kenya Times
reported the energy minister had confirmed the presence of vast oil
deposits and had said that Kenya was ready to begin looking for
pump sites.
   The newspaper of the governing Kenya African National Union
Party also quoted Biwott as saying two of five international
companies prospecting in Kenya had struck oil.
   Biwott said test wells in the northern Turkana, Marsabit and
Isiolo districts had confirmed the presence of gas and oil, but
none of the wells had ``yielded hydrocarbons in commercial
quantities.''

   Jessica McClure, whose rescue from an
abandoned well last year attracted international attention, is
playing the role of a wee celebrity to help raise funds for a boy
with serious lung problems.
   Jessica, who turned 2 on Saturday, is participating in a balloon
release this evening to benefit 5-year-old Brennan Bolin, who needs
a heart-lung transplant, benefit coordinator Bonnie Arnold said.
   The plans called for Jessica to release the first balloon,
followed by children from Lancaster elementary schools, then ``a
drawing among those children for two toys signed by Jessica,'' Mrs.
Arnold said.
   Jessica got involved because the families of the children are
acquainted, according to Mrs. Arnold. The boy's grandmother lives
in Jessica's home town of Midland.
   Brennan has idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, a rare condition
in which bleeding occurs within the lungs' lining.

   Her famous split leap is now just a memory. But at
62, Bolshoi prima ballerina Maya Plisetskaya still dominates the
rest of the troupe.
   She's three times the age of many of her co-dancers and the
oldest ballerina of stature performing today. But Plisetskaya
nonetheless is living up to the advance publicity generated by
organizers of Making Music Together, the largest Soviet-U.S.
cultural exchange ever staged.
   Although other artists also have drawn capacity crowds since the
three-week festival opened March 11, Plisetksaya has reigned
supreme among the 285 featured Soviet performers as crowd-pleasers
go.
   A capacity audience of 4,100 crowded Boston's Wang Center for
the Performing Arts for a performance based on Bizet's ``Carmen''
Tuesday, clearly enjoying the grace of Nina Ananiashvili, the
strength of Adris Liepe and the near flawless mastery of other
young principals.
   But the normally restrained Boston audience went wild over
Plisetskaya as the title character. Many moved to the front for the
curtain call to get a closer look amid bravos and sustained
applause.

   In the Tang Dynasty 1,000 years ago,
boatmen carried rice and supplies to fight the northern barbarians.
Today, boatmen on barges still pass through Huaian, but now they
carry coal and bricks to keep China's great metropolises humming.
   Life goes on, changing but always the same along the world's
longest man-made waterway, the 1,000-mile Grand Canal, which Hua
Yuhua, a local official, describes ``as great a feat as the Great
Wall.''
   In Huaian, a 1,600-year-old town in coastal Jiangsu province,
the canal remains the lifeline.
   Huaian is a bumpy, four-hour drive from the provincial capital
of Nanjing and has no railway.
   ``We have looked to the water in developing our land,'' said the
local radio station director, Wang Ruoyuan.
   Every day about 1,200 barges, some in convoys of as many as 10,
pass through the town's two locks, where they are lowered or raised
about 10 feet.
   Along the shore, a sea of men in green and blue jackets load and
unload the coal, grain, vegetables, oil, roof tile, cotton, lumber
and gravel that traverse the 220-mile Jiangsu stretch from the
Yangtze River in the south to the city of Xuzhou in the north.
   The lucky ones have donkeys, but for most a strong back and
sturdy shoulders are crucial. People strapped to harnesses tug at
carts and wagons. On one bridge, a unique pulley system helps them
up an incline.
   Bicycles weave around bridge-side stalls that sell cabbage,
oranges, soft drinks and sugar cane. Children gather around to
watch an elderly couple puff oats with a hand bellows that fires a
blackened iron pressure vessel.
   Fishermen come by with cormorants perched on bicycle handlebars,
taking the black seabirds to catch fish for them.
   Work on the canal began in the 6th century B.C. But the early
7th century Emperor Yangdi built the main sections, from the
western capital of Luoyang eastward and the north-south channel
linking Hangzhou to Beijing, China's modern-day capital.
   Hundreds of thousands are believed to have been mobilized for
the project.
   Upon its completion, the emperor sailed its length at the head
of a flotilla extending in close file for 60 miles.
   During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), what served as the ministry
of transport was in Huaian, and the city had a population of
200,000, double its current number, town official Hua said.
   The canal fell into disrepair after the Tang Dynasty, but the
Kublai Khan rebuilt it in the 13th century.
   The Communist government, after coming to power in 1949, has
built an extensive irrigation and flood control system to make life
easier for the people of this waterlogged, impoverished area.
   The town fathers also hope Huaian's rich historical heritage
will draw tourists. It was the home to Han Xin, the Han dynasty
(206 B.C.-220 A.D.) general; Wu Chengen, writer of ``Journey to the
West,'' the classic of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and the late
Premier Chou En-lai.
   One small temple along the canal has a statue in memory of the
``washerwoman,'' an upright woman who helped Gen. Han when he was a
poor boy and later refused a reward of 1,000 taels of silver.
   Near that temple, outside their one-room brick homes with
upswept tile roofs, the washerwomen of today are still down at the
canal, hard at work.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retirees don't have to worry any more about
being penalized for underpayment of estimated taxes on their 1987
pensions.
   The Internal Revenue Service announced Wednesday that it will
waive penalties that otherwise would hit retirees who failed to pay
sufficient tax in advance on their pensions.
   ``The idea is to have equity between retired people and wage
earners,'' said IRS spokesman Johnell Hunter. ``Retired people will
now have the same benefits as wage earners.''
   The IRS announced last year that it would not impose penalties
on taxpayers who had too little withheld from their 1987 wages.
That announcement was made because of widespread taxpayer confusion
about the numerous tax-law revisions enacted in 1986 and a complex
new W-4 withholding form.
   Even with these two waivers, taxpayers with large amounts of
interest, dividends and other investment income still might be
penalized if they have to pay too much tax when they file their
returns. But the penalty would not apply to wage or pension
portions of income.
   As a rule, at least 90 percent of 1987 tax liability must have
been paid in advance through withholding or estimated quarterly
payments. Withholding is not required on pensions, although most
recipients opt to have tax taken out from each check.
   The IRS said most retirees will be automatically covered by the
waiver without having to take any additional action. Those who have
already filed a return and paid the estimated-tax penalty will have
any overpayment refunded.
   A taxpayer who receives a penalty notice dated before May 2,
1988, and has not responded should call the IRS toll-free line for
assistance, the agency said. That number is 800-424-1040.
   The waiver applies to any retirement income that must be
reported on Line 16b of Form 1040, including Individual Retirement
Accounts and profit-sharing distributions, employee savings plans,
pensions and annuities.
   In another decision affecting retirees, the IRS said owners of
multiple IRAs who passed the age of 70{ in 1987 will be allowed
more discretion in choosing from which IRA to take a distribution.
Such IRA owners are required to take money from an IRA by April 1.
   A recent change in the law required those with multiple IRA
accounts to divide the minimum required distribution among those
accounts.
   Under the change announced Wednesday a past-70{ IRA owner still
will have to calculate a required distribution from each account
but may then choose to take the entire payout from any one or more
accounts.
   The IRS announcement said taxpayers who already have received
payouts from their IRAs and want to take advantage of the new rule
may be able to return the distribution to one or more accounts
under existing ``rollover'' provisions. In general, an IRA owner
has a 60-day period each year during which an account may be rolled
over into another.
   This change could benefit, for example, a retiree who has some
high-earning IRAs and some that are earning less. The retiree might
find it beneficial to take the required minimum distribution from
the less lucrative IRA and keep the high earner intact.

   A relatively light snowfall this winter means
an accordingly reduced likelihood of major spring flooding, the
National Weather Service reports.
   ``Nothing in the outlook for the coming month indicates weather
conducive to major snowmelt flooding,'' said Michael Hudlow,
director of hydrology for the agency.
   Spring weather has prompted an early snowmelt in the Eastern
states, while in the West the snowpack is below normal, he said
Wednesday.
   That doesn't mean there won't be any local flooding, however,
Hudlow cautioned. Local storms can still cause flash flooding in
many areas.
   Plus, there is a potential for some minor snowmelt flooding in
upper Michigan and northwest Minnesota due to an early March
snowstorm in that area, officials said.
   While the light Western snowpack may be good news for
flood-prone areas, it does raise concern about adequate water
supplies in the summer for areas of Idaho, Washington and Oregon,
the Weather Service said.

   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett says
teacher Jaime Escalante's dramatic success in teaching calculus to
Hispanic teen-agers in East Los Angeles puts the lie to the notion
that poor children cannot learn.
   Bennett accompanied the Garfield High School teacher to the
Washington premiere of ``Stand and Deliver,'' a movie about
Escalante.
   ``I have been to his classroom. I have seen the miracle in
process,'' Bennett told the opening-night crowd. ``Jaime Escalante
is dedicated to his students, he is dedicated to their future. He
is a true, genuine American hero.''
   Escalante dined with Bennett at the Department of Education
beforehand after guest-teaching calculus at three suburban Virginia
schools. Today he was being feted at the embassy of his native
Bolivia.
   ``I feel great. What you're going to see is 90 percent true,''
said Escalante, who is portrayed on film by actor Edward James
Olmos of ``Miami Vice.''
   ``I'm not doing anything new. I'm just helping my students reach
their highest possible degree of personal development,'' he said.
   The movie shows how Escalante cajoled a rambunctious group of
teens from an East Los Angeles barrio into taking calculus, only to
have the Educational Testing Service suspect they cheated when they
passed the Advanced Placement test en masse in 1982.
   They retook the rigorous exam and passed again with flying
colors, and since then scores of Escalante's pupils have followed
in their footsteps. Eighty-seven received advanced college credit
in calculus last year.
   Escalante sold math to them as ``the great equalizer'' and told
the students that as descendants of the Mayans, they had math in
their bones.
   ``The only thing I'm doing is sharing knowledge,'' said the
teacher, who has seen the movie before and didn't stay for
Wednesday night's showing. He left when the lights went down,
telling Bennett he was worn out from teaching calculus all day.
   Over dinner at the Department of Education, Escalante expressed
concern that his students back at Garfield High ``are falling way
behind because of this trip,'' Bennett related afterwards.
   ``This guy is the real thing,'' said Bennett.
   Bennett emerged full of praise for the film, saying, ``I think
we're going to see a lot more courses in calculus. I think it's
going to obviously lend great support to the whole idea of
expectations, of kids living up to what we expect of them.
   ``It's a movie that defies the notion that children can't learn
_ that children of poor circumstance and background can't have
their part in the American dream,'' he said.
   Bennett himself has said repeatedly that poor minority children
are best served by schools that hold them to rigorous standards,
not ones that water down their demands.

<HEAD>Dole Wants To Remain Senate GOP Leader After 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole says he gave no serious thought
to quitting politics after his presidential campaign fizzled and
will try to keep his Republican leadership post in the next session
of Congress.
   ``I don't have any regrets,'' Dole said Wednesday in an
interview a day after he exited the GOP presidential race. ``I
think obviously you don't like to lose. But I think it probably
strengthens my convictions about politics and that you can make a
difference.''
   Relaxed in his Capitol office, Dole still expressed frustration
with his inability to blunt Vice President George Bush's success in
running as the heir apparent to President Reagan.
   Dole maintained that was the main reason for his downfall _ not
what he conceded were several tactical mistakes by his campaign.
   ``The bottom line is you can't beat Ronald Reagan,'' Dole said.
``I was running against Ronald Reagan Jr. in the South.''
   Added Dole, ``It's just this promotion idea that you just ought
to go up the ladder.''
   Republican Party ``winner-take-all'' rules in the primaries and
caucuses also contributed to his exit from the race, Dole said. If
delegates were divided proportionally, he said, ``I'd still be in
the race.''
   Although disappointed with the outcome of his presidential bid,
Dole said he was committed to serving out his full six-year term in
the Senate, which ends in 1992. In addition, he said he would seek
to remain the Republican leader when the Senate reorganizesafter
this fall's elections.
   ``I don't have anybody threatening me,'' Dole said. ``Pretty
tough precinct, but I think we're in good shape.''
   In analyzing the GOP presidential race, Dole conceded that his
campaign organization had blundered, particularly in New Hampshire
and South Carolina, and that those mistakes weakened his candidacy
early in the nominating process.
   The campaign, for example, did not respond to last-minute
television ads by Bush raising questions about whether Dole would
increase taxes. His campaign spent heavily early in the nominating
process, which caused problems in later contests.
   ``Now had we won New Hampshire, we still would have had a tough
race,'' Dole said.
   ``South Carolina we probably should have bypassed instead of
getting in there,'' he added.
   He said Bush's win in South Carolina helped boost the vice
president to a sweep of the Super Tuesday primaries in the South,
including North Carolina, Missouri and Oklahoma _ states the Dole
campaign had hoped to win.
   After Super Tuesday came Illinois. Dole said, ``I knew that we
weren't going to win Illinois and I knew then it was probably
over.''
   The campaign, he said, would end with a ``little debt'' but he
didn't know the exact amount. He also expressed reservations about
the management of the campaign, saying: ``I think as far as
organization, I'm not certain whether we had enough direction.''
   Asked what he would do differently, Dole replied: ``Keep the
press off the plane.''
   A contingent of reporters traveled on the same plane as Dole and
the senator said he thought he had received some unfair coverage
during the campaign.
   For example, Dole singled out the numerous stories written about
one of his Kansas associates, Dave Owen, who resigned as national
finance chairman of the Dole campaign in January after reports
raised questions involving his financial dealings.
   Dole complained that reporters on the campaign plane ``sit back
there and they scheme up these little things and the next thing
they're in Time or Newsweek.''

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis says he does
not intend to use negative campaigning to win the Democratic
presidential nomination over his primary rival, Jesse Jackson.
   Dukakis commented after another Democratic hopeful, Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee, criticized Jackson for his lack of
experience in government.
   ``We can discuss issues without attacking each other,'' Dukakis
said Wednesday. ``(The voters) don't want to know what Gore thinks
of Jackson.''
   Dukakis said his record as governor separates him from the other
candidates and gives him the best chance of beating Republican
candidate Vice President George Bush in November.
   ``I respect the other candidates,'' he said. ``But obviously I'm
in this to win. And I believe I have the best chance to beat Mr.
Bush in the fall.''
   This sentiment was echoed by Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who
announced his endorsement of Dukakis.
   ``Michael Dukakis has the best chance to unify the party and win
the White House for the Democrats in November,'' Obey said.
   Jackson has emerged as Dukakis' main challenger after last
weekend's win in the Michigan caucuses. Dukakis responded with a
big win Tuesday in the Connecticut primary, and all the Democratic
candidates are aiming at the Wisconsin primary Tuesday, along with
Colorado's caucuses on Monday.
   Dukakis, asked whether he lacks the passionate campaign style
used by Jackson, said: ``I don't want to go down as a great
communicator. There's no question my strength is as a doer. I want
to be a great builder.''
   Dukakis spoke earlier in the evening to students at Marquette
University, where he gave a detailed discussion of his views on
Central America.
   ``I want to help build a Central America ... where our energy
and our resources are devoted to building and educating and
investing, not killing and sabotaging and tearing down,'' he said.
   Dukakis said while the United States must respond ``firmly and
forcefully'' to any attempts by one country to subvert another, he
added that too often America has ``shown our neighbors a fist when
they needed a helping hand.''
   Dukakis said he is encouraged by the negotiations between the
Nicaraguan Sandinistas and Contra rebels, and he would push all
parties to meet the obligations under the peace plan of Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias.

<TEXT>
   Police recovered a page of notes written by
Albert Einstein that had been taken from a University of Texas
display case, and arrested the grandson of former football coach
Darrell Royal.
   An investigator said the page of handwritten notes was found
Tuesday at the home of 18-year-old Samuel K. Royal. Royal was
arrested Wednesday evening, said university police Lt. Ronald
Thomas.
   The page was reported missing last week from a locked glass
display case in a campus building. It was among six pages on
display from a series addressing Euclidean rotation.
   Investigators from the district attorney's office and the
university police department recovered the manuscript late Tuesday,
said District Attorney Ronald Earle. The investigators searched the
duplex on a tip provided by Crime Stoppers, he said.
   Royal's grandfather coached at Texas from 1957 through 1976, was
UT athletic director until 1979 and now is special assistant to the
president of the university. Darrell Royal did not return telephone
calls for comment to his Austin residence.
   The younger Royal leaves near the UT campus but is not a
student, officials said.
   The missing page is part of an archive of 60 to 70 pages ``upon
which Einstein wrote the notes representing his thinking as he was
trying to work out his theories near the end of his life,'' said
John Chalmers, librarian for the university's Harry Ransom
Humanities Research Center.
   Einstein, the famed physicist who formulated the theory of
relativity, apparently wrote the notes in the early 1950s. He died
in 1955.
   The display case was locked and the glass unbroken when the
theft was discovered. It is unclear whether the person who took the
document had a key to the case or removed the document in some
other way, Chalmers said.
   Although the page likely could have been sold for a few thousand
dollars, its value far exceeds that amount, Chalmers said.
   ``For all of us, it's a piece of our heritage, and it is not to
be replaced,'' he said. ``In that sense, it has no price.''

<HEAD>Total Of $2.6 Million Handed Out To Eight Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission has given the
presidential candidates another $2.6 million, bringing the total
dispensed from the public treasury for the 1988 campaign to $48.1
million.
   As of Wednesday, former TV evangelist Pat Robertson, who is
trailing far behind Vice President George Bush in the Republican
delegate race, remained the leader in overall matching funds
received, at nearly $8.5 million.
   Bush has collected $7.4 million and Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, who
dropped out of the race Tuesday, has received $7.1 million.
   Another recipient, Democrat Richard Gephardt, a congressman from
Missouri, also dropped out this week.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., faces loss of eligibility for
matching funds by virtue of receiving less than 10 percent of the
vote in two successive primaries _ Illinois and Connecticut.
   Gore notified the Federal Election Commission, as is his legal
prerogative, that he did not want the Puerto Rico ``beauty
contest'' primary on March 20 to count toward his eligibility, said
FEC spokesman Fred Eiland. A candidate may take that option if he
chooses not to campaign actively in a given state.
   Gore's matching funds for continued campaigning will be cut off
in 30 days unless he can get at least 20 percent in a primary
contest before that time. If he did not, he could receive matching
funds only for winding-down costs and debt satisfaction.
   The federal fund matches every contribution of $250 or less that
the candidates raise from individuals.
   The fund is supported by the $1 voluntary checkoff on individual
income tax returns.
   To be eligible, a candidate must first raise $100,000 across 20
states in contributions of $250 or less, with a minimum of $5,000
total from each state.
   The amounts certified on Wednesday, followed by the total the
candidates have received to date, are:
   Bush, $557,185, $7.4 million.
   Dole, $469,054, $7.1 million.
   Michael Dukakis, $254,386, $5.9 million.
   Gephardt, $286,176, $2.6 million.
   Gore, $117,312, $2.7 million.
   Jesse Jackson, $450,547, $1.5 million.
   Robertson, $307,766, $8.5 million.
   Paul Simon, $115,346, $2.8 million.

   Violent protests have persisted despite an army
ban on free news media access to the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
challenging Israeli contentions that television cameras fueled
Palestinian riots.
   The measures against the media have been unprecedented in
Israel's 20-year occupation of the territories.
   Reporters and photographers have been barred for at least three
days and possibly longer from entering the areas where 1.5 million
Palestinians live alongside 65,000 Jewish settlers.
   The only access is with Israeli army escorts, a procedure that
prevents journalists from talking freely with Palestinians.
   Authorities also have sought to cut off major sources of
information such as the Arab-run Palestine Press Service. The news
agency offices were padlocked by police on Wednesday.
   Neither measure has been entirely effective. The Gaza Strip has
remained sealed, because of its geographic isolation and because
telephone lines have been cut.
   But reporters have circumvented roadblocks in the West Bank by
using back roads, traveling with Jewish settlers or identifying
themselves as tourists.
   And Palestinian journalists have continued to keep the foreign
news media informed of breaking developments via telephone calls.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has argued that the media
restrictions coupled with preventative arrests, economic sanctions
and other measures will eventually have a calming effect.
   ``The cumulative effect of the measures ... will join to form a
system that will bring calm,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Reflecting official thinking, Arieh Shalev, who headed Israel's
military government in the West Bank from 1974 to 1976, said in an
interview that news coverage was a key to the Palestinian uprising.
   ``One of the most important elements of the uprising is to win
international sympathy and cause damage to Israel in the hope that
this will have political effect, as well,'' said Shalev, now of Tel
Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
   ``The restriction of the media is aimed at harming their
campaign for world public opinion. This is a step Israel is taking
to weaken the Palestinians, not to get at the journalists.''
   More than 120 Palestinians have been killed since violence began
Dec. 8. One Israeli soldier has been killed. Israel's use of
bullets to quell the riots prompted international criticism, as did
the policy of beating protesters.
   Liberal critics of the media restrictions, who were decidedly in
the minority, argued that Israel was sacrificing democratic
principles.
   Ido Dissentchik, editor of the mass circulation Maariv daily,
said in an interview the closure was a ``heavy price to pay.''
   ``I think it's an hysterical step. I hope that it doesn't
indicate that people in authority are losing their heads,'' said
Dissentchik. ``Israeli authorities must live with this problem
called democracy.''
   There has been a solid consensus among ordinary Israelis that
the riots were feeding off media coverage and that it would be
foolish and self-destructive to allow it to continue.
   The psychological basis for the decision to close off the areas,
at least in part, involves a unique Israeli sensitivity about being
a victim.
   One of the worst insults in Israel is to be called a ``fryar,''
Hebrew slang for patsy, a person who lets other people take
advantage of him.
   Many Israelis feel they are becoming just that: victims of their
own openness and democratic traditions.
   Officials also argue Israel has been subjected to a double
standard by the foreign news media, and that no Arab state would
have used the restraint Israel has shown.
   ``When Arabs kill Arabs it's not news,'' said one official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Officials also complained the media gave prominence to the
bloodshed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip but ignored loss of life
elsewhere in the world.
   One cited what he described as relatively fleeting coverage of
Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons on Iranian-occupied Kurdish
villages in which Iran claimed 5,000 people were killed.
   Another pointed to a newspaper that gave front-page play to the
shooting death of a Palestinian woman but carried deep inside the
paper the story of hundreds of people reportedly massacred in
Brazil.
   ``If this is the double standard the world is going to adopt,
then we can do without them,'' said the official.
   Officials also alleged anti-Israeli and even anti-Semitic bias.
They showed a reporter newspaper stories or cartoons equating
Israeli measures against Palestinians with those used against Jews
by Nazi Germany or which used Jewish symbols such as Stars of David
or menorah candelabras.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill To Revive Domestic Uranium Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has approved legislation designed
to revive the domestic uranium industry in a move that bodes
serious problems for a U.S.-Canadian trade pact.
   The measure, sent to the House on a 62-28 vote Wednesday, also
would restructure the government-owned industry, which prepares
uranium ore for use as fuel in commercial nuclear reactors.
   The legislation has prompted concern over the trade agreement
because it would impose a schedule of escalating fees on nuclear
utilities that load their reactors with more than 37.5 percent
foreign uranium.
   Opponents, including Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Daniel
Evans, R-Wash., argued that the provision would violate the recent
free trade pact signed with Canada, a leading exporter of uranium
that is cheaper and of higher grade than the ore produced by U.S.
mills.
   An attempt by Bradley and Evans to strike the import penalties
lost 47-45.
   In arguing for the bill, Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.,
complained that President Reagan's treaty negotiators let the
Canadians say, in effect, that ``We not only want your (uranium)
market, we want to wipe you out.''
   Reagan has vowed to veto any bill that violates the trade pact.
   The legislation would convert the Department of Energy's uranium
enrichment program, a multibillion-dollar loser since the
mid-1970s, into a corporation owned by the government. If the
enterprise begins turning profits, the treasury could sell the
stock in a bid to recover previous investments.
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., who guided the measure through
his Energy Committee, said it is ``the culmination of six years of
legislative effort to fashion a sound, sensible, and well-balanced
program to address the challenges we face today in the uranium
industry and the nuclear fuel cycle.''
   He estimated the bill would restore 20,000 jobs in the uranium
mining industry, which has dwindled to just 2,000 workers in this
decade. And he estimated the uranium enrichment workforce, cut by
half since 1980, could be restored to at least 12,000 jobs.
   The United States was once the world's only supplier of enriched
uranium, and the domestic nuclear power industry has grown at a far
slower rate than originally projected.
   The number of domestic uranium mines dropped from 362 in 1979 to
3 in 1986; net earnings for the industry were negative the last
three years; and imports accounted for an increasing share of
domestic requirements.
   Opponents say a provision settling the industry's debt to the
government for enrichment costs in exchange for $364 million in
future payments is a bailout for the industry. Their estimates of
the real cost range from $3 billion to $8.8 billion.
   The 1954 Atomic Energy Act required the government to be fully
compensated for its enrichment of nuclear fuel used by commercial
utilities. The process is performed at three DOE facilities, at Oak
Ridge, Tenn.; Paducah, Ky.; and Portsmouth, Ohio.
   Enrichment involves increasing the percentage of fissionable
material in natural uranium from 0.7 percent to about 3 percent,
the amount necessary for use in light-water reactors.
   Although the legislation would impose import fees on utilities
using more than 37.5 percent foreign uranium, the utilities would
be able to buy up to half their uranium from foreign suppliers
without penalty starting in 1995.
   Another section of the bill would create a $1 billion fund to
clean up or stablize large, mildly radioactive piles of uranium
tailings at 26 sites in Colorado, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas,
Utah, Washington state and Wyoming. The cost would be shared
equally by uranium mill owners, nuclear utilities and the
government.

   An 18-year-old woman, whose quest to end
her pregnancy was upheld by a district court but blocked an hour
later by the Utah Court of Appeals, obtained an abortion between
the two rulings Wednesday, a court spokeswoman said.
   The appellate court had scheduled a Monday hearing to consider
25-year-old Michael Reynolds' appeal of 3rd District Judge David S.
Young's decision to vacate an earlier restraining order, which
banned Reynolds' estranged wife, Jennifer, from ending her
pregnancy, in its eighth weeks.
   The higher court's ruling was issued within an hour of Young's
decision, but Mrs. Reynolds, who did not attend the court
proceedings, had an abortion before she was served with the
appellate court order, said Rosemary Gacnik, spokeswoman for the
state court system.
   ``She did have the abortion before she was served with the
papers, which would've prevented her from doing so,'' Gacnik said.
``It was during that time lapse between when the ban was lifted and
when the Court of Appeals issued its own restraining order.''
   Gacnik said Monday's hearing was now ``a moot issue,'' although
Mrs. Reynolds' attorneys had not filed a motion to vacate the
appellate court's order as of the close of court offices late
Wednesday.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if her attorney filed a motion to
vacate the hearing, but that remains to be seen,'' Gacnik said.
   Young, who last week ruled that Mrs. Reynolds could not have an
abortion pending resolution of a divorce-related custody dispute
involving both a 10-month-old infant and the unborn child, accepted
arguments by American Civil Liberties Union attorneys Wednesday
that the woman has a constitutional right to end her pregnancy.
   Young said while Reynolds may have the right to be consulted
about any abortion involving Mrs. Reynolds, she had the ultimate
authority over whether to carry the fetus to term.
   Following the hearing, defense attorney David Dolowitz said he
believed his client would ``secure an abortion'' as soon as
possible.
   Reynolds' attorney, Mitchell Barker, said Monday's hearing might
be pointless if the fetus had been aborted.
   ``If the abortion has taken place, we're going to have to make
some serious evaluation ... there's a pretty good argument that
would make it moot,'' he said.
   Utah is one of four states with laws requiring wives to notify
husbands of abortion decisions.
   During arguments before Young, Dolrowitz said Reynolds wanted
the court to order Mrs. Reynolds to ``do what he (Reynolds) wants
to do with her body.''
   Young's earlier restraining order was in effect ``telling my
client that she must use her body to carry his baby,'' Dolowitz
added.
   Co-counsel Julie Bryan said the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Roe
vs. Wade that husbands have no veto power over their wives'
abortion decisions.
   The high court ruled that when a husband and wife disagree over
an abortion, ``the view of only one of the two marriage partners
can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the
child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the
pregnancy ... the balance weighs in her favor,'' Bryan said.

<HEAD>HHS Chief Urges Cholesterol Testing In Effort Against Heart
Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's top health official
has some advice for Americans on how to avoid heart attacks: Get
your cholesterol checked and do something about it if it's too high.
   ``Most people can lower their cholesterol level by reducing the
amount of cholesterol and saturated fat in their diet,'' Health and
Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen said Wednesday. ``Some need
a combination of diet and drugs.''
   His point was that anyone can lower his or her blood
cholesterol, and that anyone with a level above 200
milligrams-per-deciliter _ which puts them at excessive risk for
heart attack _ should do so.
   That 200-milligram level takes in about half of all adult
Americans.
   ``About one in four adults has a cholesterol number of 240 or
more, which puts them at even greater risk and commands medical
attention,'' Bowen said at a news conference.
   ``First, know your number,'' said Bowen. ``Getting your level
checked is the only way to find out. Cholesterol, like high blood
pressure, is a silent killer. There are no signs or symptoms.''
   About 400 hospitals across the nation will offer cholesterol
testing May 4. Most will do it free, but a few will charge $3.
   That mass screening, the first in history, was organized
independently by the Voluntary Hospitals of America and announced
last week.
   Television spots promoting the program, called ``CountDown
USA,'' began airing this week and include a toll-free telephone
number _ 800-634-9541 _ for people to call weekdays from 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. EST to find out which hospitals in their areas will offer
the testing.
   An initial screening can be simple and quick. Small machines _
about 6,000 have been sold since they won market approval two years
ago _ take about three minutes to analyze blood drawn from a
finger-tip stick.
   If that preliminary figure is within the safety zone, no further
testing is indicated. If it is borderline or high, a more elaborate
analysis is needed of a regular blood sample.
   Television and radio talk show host Larry King said his
cholesterol count was above 300 a little over a year ago. ``I
didn't pay attention to it,'' he said. ``I had a heart attack Feb.
24, 1987. I had quadruple heart bypass surgery Dec. 1, 1987.''
   King pays attention now, he said, and has his count down to 170.
He also is featured in public service spots to be aired during the
next few weeks urging people to get tested.
   Bowen said research has shown that each 1 percent reduction in
cholesterol results in a 2 percent reduction in the risk of heart
disease. ``In other words, a reduction of 25 percent in the
cholesterol level can cut the risk of heart disease in half,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Woman Believed World's Oldest Person Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ulysses S. Grant was in the White House and
Gen. George Custer was one year away from making his last stand
when Orpha Nussbaum was born Aug. 13, 1875.
   Mrs. Nussbaum, believed by the Guinness Book of World Records to
be the world's oldest person, died Wednesday at age 112.
   She had pneumonia recently, but an official cause of death was
not released, said Diane Hostetler, director of nursing at
Fountainview Nursing Home, where Mrs. Nussbaum lived.
   ``Her condition worsened during the weekend,'' Miss Hostetler
said.
   ``She couldn't do anything for herself anymore,'' said a
stepdaughter-in-law, Betty Nussbaum. ``You can't do anything for a
person who doesn't want to live anymore.''
   Betty Nussbaum said she was saddened by the death, but said Mrs.
Nussbaum had lived a good life.
   Last month, Guinness officials said they believed she was the
oldest person alive.
   Mrs. Nussbaum was honored at a special ceremony in January when
officials placed the Goshen city seal on census documents
indicating she was born in 1875 on the family farm near Middlebury
about 10 miles away. She spent most of her life in Middlebury until
moving to the nursing home in 1982.
   Florence Knapp, who lived in a Philadelphia suburb, had been
recognized as the world's oldest person until her death Jan. 11.
She was 114 years and 94 days old.
   Guinness restricts recognition to those who can provide birth
records and other documentation.
   There had been some confusion whether Mrs. Nussbaum would be 112
or 113 last Aug. 13. For years she had maintained she was a year
older than she actually was.
   But a document found in the public library in this northern
Indiana city last September showed that the former Orpha Ulery was
4 years old when she was counted in the U.S. Census of 1880, making
her 112.
   Mrs. Nussbaum attributed her longevity to her strict obedience
to a biblical command, Betty Nussbaum said. ``She honored her
father and mother. That's it,'' she said.
   For many years Mrs. Nussbaum taught Sunday school in the Elkhart
and Goshen areas. When she was 93, she resumed writing poetry, a
hobby she had stopped in the 1920s.
   Mrs. Nussbaum married John Mischler, a minister, in 1897. After
his death, she married Frank Nussbaum in 1947. He died in 1959.

   Memory problems in rats caused by chronic
alcohol intake were mostly reversed with brain tissue transplants,
and such therapy may someday help alcoholics and victims of
Alzheimer's disease, a researcher says.
   ``I think that really means there's hope, if you blow your mind
with too much whiskey, maybe we'll be able to repair it with
transplants,'' or similarly ease mental deficits in Alzheimer's,
said Jeffrey Gray of the Institute of Psychiatry in London.
   But experts in alcohol-induced memory problems were skeptical,
questioning the resemblance of the rats' condition to that of
alcoholics and cautioning that any implication for treatment is
only speculation.
   Still, ``I think it's going to stimulate lots of excitement and
lots of further research,'' said Michael Eckardt, chief of the
clinical brain research section in the laboratory of clinical
studies at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
   Gray, head of the psychology department at the psychiatric
institute in London, reports the research with colleagues in
Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature.
   About 10 percent of alcoholics develop long-lasting memory loss,
either by itself or as part of an overall loss in intellectual
abilities, according to the federal alcohol institute.
   In the new work, 78 male rats drank an alcohol solution as the
only fluid in an otherwise normal diet for 28 weeks. Four weeks
later, they did poorer than other rats in learning to find food in
a maze.
   But rats that then got transplants of fetal rat brain tissue to
two brain areas, the neocortex and the hippocampus, later performed
almost as well as normal rats, the researchers said.
   The fetal tissue was rich in a substance called acetylcholine,
which some brain cells use to communicate. The transplants
apparently worked by raising inadequate levels of the substance in
the brain, Gray said.
   Alzheimer's is not related to alcohol. But an acetylcholine
defect has also been identified in that disease, which involves
problems in memory and thinking, Gray said.
   David Drachman of the University of Massachusetts in Worcester,
an Alzheimer's expert, said previous research has shown that
impairment of the brain's acetylcholine circuitry can hinder mental
performance. Treating that impairment has helped in regaining
mental powers, he said.
   But Alzheimer's affects far more of the brain than just
acetylcholine-using cells, and whether Gray's strategy would
significantly help Alzheimer patients remains to be seen, he said.
   In alcoholics, memory loss without other intellectual decline is
called Korsakoff's psychosis. Eckardt said scientists are still
studying whether it is caused by excessive alcohol intake, by a
deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in the alcoholic's usually poor
diet, or by a combination of those factors.
   The new research did not involve thiamine deficiency, so
connecting its results to Korsakoff's is speculative, Eckardt said.
   The rats did not display a type of brain damage, called
diencephalic lesions, that is characteristic of Korsakoff's. The
researchers said that suggests the lesions are not responsible for
the memory problems.
   But that is ``much too speculative,'' and clashes with evidence
that does implicate the lesions, said Philip Langlais, a
Korsakoff's researcher at the University of California, San Diego.
   The lesions are generally accepted as causing the memory
deficits in the condition, so the rats did not truly have an animal
version of Korsakoff's psychosis, said Marlene Oscar Berman,
professor of neurology and psychiatry at the Boston University
School of Medicine.

   Since President Reagan took office in 1981,
his policy of financing the Contra rebels in their war against
Nicaragua's Sandinista government has been one of the most divisive
foreign-policy questions facing Congress and the nation. Here is a
chronology of the ups and downs of that policy:
   1981 _ Congress, late in the year, approves $19 million in
covert military aid to the rebels. The money, to be managed by the
CIA, is part of a classified intelligence bill.
   1982 _ A second infusion of $19 million, again part of a
classified bill, is approved. This time, restrictive provisions are
added that prevent any of the money from being used to overthrow
the Sandinista government. There are reports, as well, that the CIA
has used an additional $10 million from its contingency fund.
   1983 _ The House votes to end Contra aid, but a later compromise
results in the appropriation of $24 million for the rebels. This
time, the money is appropriated openly, and the CIA is barred from
using any money from its contingency fund to supplement the new aid.
   1984 _ In April, reports surface that the CIA has supervised the
mining of three Nicaraguan ports, and Congress votes to cut off aid
to the rebels. But at the end of the year, lawmakers vote to set
aside $14 million for the rebels, to be released after Feb. 28,
1985, if Congress approves in a separate vote at that time.
Congress adds new restrictions, saying the CIA and the Pentagon may
not use the money to support paramilitary operations in Nicaragua
unless specifically authorized by Congress.
   1985 _ In April the Senate votes to release the $14 million, but
the House votes against the resolution, denying the money to the
rebels. That summer, Congress approves $27 million for the Contras
but restricts its use to food, clothing, medicine and other
``humanitarian'' aid. The money is directed to be used by the
administration as leverage to promote peace negotiations, and the
CIA and Defense Department are barred from any role in distributing
the money.
   1986 _ In the fall, Congress approves $100 million _ its largest
single appropriation for the rebels _ the bulk of it for military
aid. Restrictions on the CIA's role are lifted, except that the
agency remains barred from using its contingency fund.
   1987 _ In March, the House passes a moratorium on Contra aid in
an effort to hold up the final $40 million of the aid bill approved
in 1986, but the measure dies in the Senate. At the end of the
fiscal year, on Sept. 30, Congress begins a series of stopgap
funding measures that include money for ``non-lethal'' aid for the
rebels totaling another $20 million.
   1988 _ Under procedures laid out in late 1987, the House on Feb.
3 kills President Reagan's request for $36 million in rebel aid,
including $3.6 million in military aid. A month later, the House
also rejects a Democratic alternative that would have provided $30
million in solely humanitarian aid. The rebels reach a negotiated
truce with the Sandinistas on March 23, and a new $48 million
proposal is drafted in the House with bipartisan support.

   Tenor Alfredo Kraus brought dignity and elegance
to the title role of Massenet's ``Werther,'' the final opera to
enter this season's repertory at the Metropolitan Opera.
   Some tenors portray Werther as a self-pitying nut case as he
pines for his beloved Charlotte, who has married another man to
fulfill a promise to her dying mother.
   But in Wednesday's performance Kraus gave him the dignity of a
man feeling overwhelming love. Vocally he was lean, elegant,
refined, distinguished.
   Frederica von Stade as Charlotte sang well throughout but rather
blandly in the first two acts, as she denied her love for Werther
and stuck steadfastly to her husband. In Act 3, with her love
churning to the surface as Werther falls into suicidal depression,
Miss von Stade came through with passionate vocalizing.
   Dawn Upshaw sang Charlotte's sister Sophie in a voice as fresh
as spring. It almost seemed to lilt. Richard Stilwell did well with
Albert. All voices were well focused. Jean Fournet conducted his
first ``Werther'' at the Met, beautifully shaping the music.
   The present production, last heard at the Met eight years ago,
was new in 1971. Rudolf Heinrich's sets for Acts 1 and 2 are
realistic and attractive. After Werther's mind cracks, set walls
meet at odd angles. In the finale scene, his room looks like a coal
cellar.
   ``Werther'' will be heard on the Metropolitan's last Saturday
afternoon broadcast. The season ends April 16.

<HEAD>Jackson's Campaign Mainstays: `Economic Violence,' Anti-Drug
Message</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The message that Jesse Jackson has been
preaching with startling success on the Democratic campaign trail
is ``stop economic violence against American farmers and workers.
Stop drugs. Invest in our children. Reinvest in America.''
   ``There's nothing radical about his message,'' John White, the
Texan who was chairman of the Democratic Party during the Carter
administration and now a Jackson supporter, said Wednesday. ``It's
neither liberal nor conservative. It's the core language of the
Democratic Party.''
   But much of Jackson's platform is decidedly liberal and dovish.
The candidate himself calls it ``the opposite of Reaganomics.''
   He has promised a universal, comprehensive health program for
all Americans, a goal of Democrats since Harry Truman.
   He wants to double the budget for education and raise the
minimum wage.
   And he would pay for his social initiatives by raising taxes on
the rich and slashing Pentagon spending.
   Jackson, who has finished first or second in most of the
Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses and is close behind
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the delegate chase, has cast
himself as the candidate of the displaced farmer and factory
worker, the hungry and the homeless, and those who fear their
toehold on financial security is precarious.
   ``Economic violence haunts the lives of most Ameicans,'' Jackson
said in a policy paper.
   ``There is nothing wrong with the American worker, the family
farmer, or the small businessperson. There is something wrong with
the system.''
   Jackson has called for a moratorium on family farm foreclosures;
civil rights legislation to protect lesbians and gay men; tapping
public pension funds to build housing, roads, mass transit and
water systems; debt relief and an ``international Marshall Plan''
for the Third World; a national floor for welfare benefits; a
phase-out of nuclear power; a freeze on nuclear weapons, and a halt
to U.S. aid for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua and the UNITA
insurgents in Angola.
   He claims he could cut the deficit by one-third by raising taxes
on ``the richest 1 percent'' of Americans and on corporations.
   Here are some of Jackson's key positions:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MIDDLE EAST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson says, ``U.S. policy in the Middle East is fatally
flawed. It is not working for Israel, for the Palestinians or for
the interests of the United States.''
   He has called for an alternative policy that ``moves the process
that began at Camp David to the next progressive step.'' It would
be built on such principles as ``the right of Israel to exist (and)
the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,
including an independent state.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HEALTH CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson says there should be a universal, comprehensive health
care program for all, not just the elderly, ``no matter what their
income.''
   It would cover long-term care as well as services Medicare now
leaves uncovered, and it would be administered by the federal
government and ``paid for by earmarked health taxes and general
revenues.''
   Most hospitals and other institutions would remain private,
providing services under contract with the federal government at
regulated fees. By emphasizing prevention, it could actually be
cheaper than what Americans now pay, Jackson claims.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MILITARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson calls himself ``a true peace candidate,'' and boasts
that he is the only Democrat who opposed Reagan's invasion of
Grenada and his bombing of Libya. He also favors ending the U.S.
military build-up in the Persian Gulf.
   He proposes to save $40 billion by not building two new aircraft
carrier task forces, and ``tens of billions of dollars'' by
negotiating further arms reductions with the Soviets.
   He opposes building the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber,
the Trident D-5 missile, or any more MX missiles. He opposes
deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative, and wants to halt
U.S. troop maneuvers in Honduras.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``We must fight back against runaway corporations. Tax subsidies
which aid U.S. corporations to invest abroad must be eliminated,''
he said.
   Jackson has proposed borrowing with federal guarantees 10
percent of the $600 billion assets of public pension funds to
create an American Investment Bank for development projects.
   He says American business needs a new code of conduct, tougher
anti-trust laws and tax incentives to invest in new plants and
equipment. He would shift federal research and development funds
from the military to civilian uses, saying the United States is
``making what the world isn't buying.''
   Jackson would require advance warning of plant closures and
making business pay ``a fair share of the costs of dislocation.''
   He supports equal pay for jobs of comparable worth _ a key issue
for women _ and wants to raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage to
$4.65 and then index it to the growth of average wages.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson's anti-drug crusade, the centerpiece of his campaign,
calls for increased Coast Guard funding to stop the influx of
drugs. He would offer drug-producing countries substitute crops to
replace drug crops and tie cooperation to trade and foreign policy
decisions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FARMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``We need a moratorium on family farm foreclosures,'' says
Jackson.
   He would shift the focus of federal programs to family farmers
and help producers of raw commodities ``band together to become
their own processors'' and cut out the middlemen.
   He charges that four corporations control 80 percent of the
grain trade, and five companies hold 58 percent of the beef
industry.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson would double the $21 billion federal education budget to
boost aid for college students and provide ``full funding for
compensatory, bilingual and special education programs,'' as well
as Head Start, which now serves only a third of eligible children.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jackson would guarantee annual cost-of-living raises for Social
Security recipients and leave the program ``out of the budget
debate (to) stop striking fear into the hearts of our seniors.''

<HEAD>Jews Find Fewer Soviet Obstacles To Passover Celebrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jews are celebrating Passover with an abundance of
matzoh, the ancient symbol of freedom that is more available in
Moscow this year.
   Other changes since last Passover include a modest expansion of
Jewish culture, limited availability of some kosher foods and
visits by Soviet Jews to relatives abroad.
   Many of the capital's 200,000 Jews have been flocking to the
main synagogue to buy the thin, cracker-like unleavened bread eaten
during the eight-day commemoration of the freeing of the ancient
Hebrews from slavery in Egypt.
   Several Jews making purchases in the dark lobby of the Moscow
Choral Synagogue said matzoh is not as difficult to obtain as it
has been in the past.
   ``Times have become easier with glasnost,'' said Sasha, 26,
referring to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of more
openness on some issues. ``Under (former Soviet leader Leonid I.)
Brezhnev, people gathering in large groups around the synagogue
waiting to buy matzoh were driven away.''
   Earlier years also saw matzoh shortages.
   ``There were deficit problems with flour. Now, everything is
OK,'' said an elderly man who carried a rectangular package of
matzoh.
   Several afternoons before the start of the holiday at sundown
Friday, a steady stream of customers bought matzoh wrapped in white
or brown paper marked ``Kosher for Passover'' in Russian and Hebrew.
   Yuri A. Korzhenevich, one of the synagogue's two rabbis,
acknowledged in an interview that the government didn't provide
enough flour for matzoh from 1965-1969 but said this year's
allotment of 135 tons satisfied the demand.
   Trucks made deliveries daily to the synagogue from what
Korzhenevich calls a ``matzoh bakery,'' a tiny two-story,
pre-revolutionary brown building in downtown Moscow.
   The chief matzoh maker, Pavel N. Spaskin, gave a reporter a tour
of the bakery, tucked behind apartment buildings and across the
street from a popular cooperative restaurant.
   ``We've been producing matzoh here for 20 years,'' said Spaskin,
a small gray-haired man of 38.
   The bakery already had stopped production for the year, and its
stainless steel mixers and dough-rolling tables lay idle.
   Spaskin said he recently compared his product with American
matzoh.
   The American matzoh ``was more airy,'' he said. ``It would be
interesting to know the technology Americans use, or maybe it's a
different flour.''
   Aside from abundant matzoh supplies, the government has allowed
these improvements in Jewish life since last Passover:
   _Hungary's Jews sent in some Kosher wine, chickens and salami.
Religious books also have been imported.
   _A Jewish museum and library have been set up in private Moscow
apartments.
   _Last year, as relations with the West improved, more than 8,000
Soviet Jews were permitted to leave the country, nearly eight times
as many as the year before and the highest total since 1981.
   Among those who have left in recent months are longtime Jewish
activists and refuseniks Josef Begun, Vladimir Slepak, Ida Nudel,
Noam Meiman and Alexander Lerner and pianist Vladimir Feltsman.
   Soviet authorities also are allowing increased numbers of Jews
to travel to the West to visit relatives.
   In an exchange with the New York City Jewish community, American
Rabbi Marc Schneier and Cantor Joel Selter are scheduled to lead
Passover services in the Moscow Choral Synagogue on Friday, and the
Choral Synagogue's chief rabbi, Abraham Shayevich, will be in the
pulpit in New York.
   And there are more subtle signs of change. Michael Stolar, the
28-year-old son of Chicago-born refusenik Abe Stolar, said he and a
group of six friends meet daily in the Choral Synagogue to study
the Talmud, the writings on Jewish civil and religious law.
   ``Two to four years ago, you had to be quite careful about where
you prayed or studied. You could have an unexpected visit by the
militia,'' he said.
   Still, problems remain.
   Thousands of Jews are waiting to leave. And anti-Semitism
persists: a Soviet newspaper this week accused Moscow's other
synagogue of brainwashing Jewish children into wanting to go to
Israel, and the word ``No!'' was scrawled in English next to a Star
of David on an outside wall of the matzoh bakery.

   Barbara Bush says her husband is not ready
to start thinking about a Republican vice-presidential running mate
yet _ and even if he were, he'd keep it to himself.
   ``He ...said he didn't want to give it away now, or it would be
a boring Republican convention,'' Mrs. Bush said as she campaigned
for her husband at a country club lunch here on Wednesday.
   Mrs. Bush said she doesn't plan to change her style if her
husband is elected to the White House. The white-haired,
62-year-old Mrs. Bush said she shrugs off remarks that she looks
old enough to be the mother of her youthful-looking husband.
   ``I'd love to be a size 4, beautiful and twenty-years old,''
quipped Mrs. Bush. ``But I know I can't be that so I'll just be me.
... Sometimes the comments can be brutal but most times I make a
joke about it.''
   She said she enjoys the campaigning but doesn't think her
husband's public image reflects his real personality.
   ``People have no inkling how funny George is and how
extraordinarily caring he is,'' she said. ``I adore George Bush.
It's easy to.''

   Former Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater
says Jesse Jackson is the most intelligent Democratic presidential
candidate in the 1988 race.
   Goldwater, a Republican presidential candidate in 1964, said of
Jackson, ``he's the most intelligent man running on the Democratic

   ``Whether he'll make a good president, well, that's something
you can ask about any president,'' Goldwater said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Pollster Says Jackson Can't Win California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pollster Mervin Field says it is very
unlikely that Jesse Jackson could win the June 7 California
Democratic presidential primary in a two-man race against Michael
Dukakis.
   ``If Jesse Jackson wins in California, this would rank as one of
the biggest political happenings since the country was founded,''
Field told a luncheon of the Sacramento Press Club on Wednesday.
   But he said Jackson could do better in a three-way race
including Albert Gore.
   The San Francisco-based political pollster, who publishes the
California Poll, said he doesn't think the California primary ``is
as promising as Michigan and the other industrial states'' for
Jackson.
   California is not as economically distressed as those states and
Jackson's appeal is to the economically distressed, he said. And
the black population in California is not as large as in some other
states: 8 percent of the general population and 14 percent of
Democrats, he said.

<HEAD>Official Predicts 1.6 Million Turnout In Wisconsin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 1.6 million voters are
expected to go to the polls Tuesday in Wisconsin's presidential
preference primary, a state Elections Board official says.
   That turnout would be about 45 percent of Wisconsin's estimated
3.5 million eligible voters, said Kevin Kennedy, the board's
executive director.
   In Wisconsin's 1984 primary, voter participation dropped to 27.4
percent of the voting-age population.
   One factor in that turnout was the insistence of the national
Democratic Party that Wisconsin Democrats use a caucus system
instead of its open primary to select delegates to the national
convention.
   This year, the open primary, in which voters are not required to
state party preference, will again be used for delegate selection.

<HEAD>California Backers Fail To Get Cuomo's Name On Ballot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mario Cuomo supporters have failed to
gather enough signatures to put the New York governor's name on
California's presidential primary ballot, state officials say.
   But the head of a draft Cuomo committee said his group plans to
try to convince a court to add Cuomo to the list of Democratic
candidates on the June 7 ballot.
   ``We knew that when we submitted the names that we did not have
enough signatures, but we did it anyway because we felt that we had
substantially complied with a law that has serious constitutional
problems,'' said Steven Polard, a Los Angeles attorney who heads
the California Draft Cuomo for President Committee.
   Committee members turned in about 16,000 signatures, Polard
said. They needed at least 22,500 _ a minimum of 500 from each of
the state's 45 congressional districts, according to Caren
Daniels-Meade, a spokeswoman for Secretary of State March Fong Eu.
   But state election officials had said earlier that even if the
committee collected enough signatures they would not put Cuomo's
name on the ballot unless he authorized it.
   The New York governor has refused to enter the presidential
primaries but he has not ruled out accepting a draft at the
Democratic National Convention.
   Daniels-Meade said Cuomo will not appear on the California
ballot now unless he announces his candidacy for president,
qualifies for federal matching funds and actively campaigns for the
office.
   If those things happen, Eu can add Cuomo's name to the ballot,
she said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Passes Budget Plan Following Reagan's Priorities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A big boost for the space program along with
cuts in aid to local and state governments are contained in the
$1.1 trillion fiscal 1989 budget approved by the Senate Budget
Committee.
   The plan, closer to President Reagan's priorities than the
budget passed by the House earlier this month, was approved 18-3 on
Wednesday and sent to the full Senate for consideration.
   Committee chairman Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., and Sen. Pete V.
Domenici of New Mexico, the panel's senior Republican, drafted the
bipartisan compromise and it sailed through the committee in a
single day.
   There's even an outside chance Congress will meet its April 15
deadline for final budget action, although the Senate doesn't plan
to vote on the resolution until after next week's holiday recess.
   But opponents and supporters complained that while they were
living up to the terms of last fall's deficit reduction agreement
with Reagan, the result was to put off much-needed fiscal reforms
until next year.
   ``We need to get this out and then start showing what the
problems are going to be,'' said Chiles.
   Sen. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo., said it was mostly a plan to ``get
past the November election.''
   ``There's an old saying, `No guts, no glory,''' said Armstrong.
``And this is a no-glory budget.'' Armstrong and Sens. Steve Symms,
R-Idaho, and Kent Conrad, D-N.D., voted against the plan.
   Total deficit reduction in the Senate budget proposal would be
$7.2 billion, accomplished in part by holding spending on most
programs short of the full inflation increases they would normally
get. More than half the saving would come from selling off
government assets.
   It would meet the $136 billion deficit-reduction target of the
Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law only because the committee
decided to use optimistic White House economic projections. The
non-partisan Congressional Budget Office predicts a deficit more
than $30 billion higher.
   Last fall's pact with the president set overall spending limits
of $294 billion, $16.1 billion for foreign aid and $169.2 billion
for domestic spending other than Social Security and entitlement
programs.
   The agreement also included $14 billion in new taxes that were
enacted last year and will be in effect for fiscal 1989, which
begins Oct. 1.
   The Senate budget envisions spending $13 billion of the domestic
allocation on space and science in the year beginning Oct. 1, about
the same amount Reagan requested and nearly $1 billion more than
the House approved.
   In addition to the 27 percent increase for the space program,
that money would boost National Science Foundation programs by 11
percent and move ahead the proposed construction of a giant physics
project known as the superconducting super collider.
   Like the House, the Senate committee declined to kill any
programs, relying instead on across-the-board spending restraint to
reach deficit-reduction targets without making those tough choices
in an election year.
   But while most programs would get at least a partial inflation
boost, community and regional development would be cut $100 million
from last year's $5.8 billion last year.
   Tom Cochran, executive director of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, said aid to localities has been cut too deeply already
during the Reagan years. ``The priorities of this thing are out of
whack,'' he said of the Senate plan.
   A Republican amendment to carry out some of Reagan's plan to
eliminate those development programs was withdrawn, and Domenici
was defeated when he tried to require selling off two federally
owned oil tracts, and said that,
   ``Sooner or later, we're going to have to get rid of some
programs.'' But it was, Domenici said, still a ``a fair, balanced
budget.''
   The proposal would, like the administration and House budgets,
call for big increases in spending on AIDS research, air traffic
safety and education.
   The Senate plan assumes that if legislation providing
catastrophic health insurance for Medicare recipients is approved,
there will be an accompanying increase in premiums to cover the
cost.
   An additional $500 million would be provided to continue
supplying cheese and other surplus commodities to the needy.
   Like the president's budget, the Senate plan would grant 4.3
percent pay raises for the military and 2 percent for civilian
federal workers. The House adopted a 3 percent across-the-board pay
hike.

<HEAD>March Farm Price Index Up 10 Percent From Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lettuce prices bounced up again in March but
didn't approach their winter peaks, and the farm prices of cattle
eggs and broilers were up, too.
   But the Agriculture Department says this month's farm prices for
hogs, milk, wheat and sweet corn were down, and that left the March
index where it was in February.
   Even so, the March average of prices received by farmers was up
7.4 percent from a year ago, the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board said Wednesday.
   ``The price of lettuce increased sharply from February to March
but was well below record levels during the November through
January 1988 period,'' the report said. ``Calf prices dropped
slightly from February to March but were at the second highest
level since June of 1979.''
   Prices of cattle sold for beef were the highest since May 1979,
the report said. Hog and wheat prices declined from February, while
corn prices rose slightly.
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers may be in
the range of $50 billion to $55 billion this year, down from the
record level of $57 billion in 1987. That is the difference between
cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
   According to the preliminary March figures, based mostly on
mid-month averages, the index for crop prices was up 0.9 percent
from February and averaged 10 percent more than a year ago.
   Commercial vegetable prices rose 11 percent from last month but
were down 7.1 percent from March 1987.
   ``Higher prices for lettuce and tomatoes were major contributors
to the increase in the (vegetable) index,'' the report said.
   Lettuce prices were reported at $21.30 per 100 pounds, compared
with $11.10 in February and $35.60 in January.
   The index for livestock and livestock products was down 0.7
percent from February but was 4.2 percent above March 1987. Prices
were higher for cattle, eggs and broilers but were lower for hogs
and milk.
   March farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base
used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures, the same
as in February. A year ago the March index was 121 percent.
   No new figures for farm production costs were included in the
report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages because of
budget cutbacks.
   In January, however, farm expenses were unchanged from last fall
but averaged 4.4 percent above a year earlier. The next quarterly
figures will be reported in April.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $68.40 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $67.40 in February and the $59.30 reported for
March 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $41.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $45.80 in
March and $47.40 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $1.84 a bushel, was up from $1.83 in February and the
average of $1.47 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.64 per bushel, compared with $2.79 in February and
$2.57 a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $8.46 per 100 pounds, compared with $8.97 in
February and $3.62 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $5.93 per bushel, compared with $5.97 in February
and $4.73 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 56.9 cents per pound, compared
with 56.8 in February and 47.5 cents in March 1987.
   _Eggs were 50.8 cents per dozen, compared with 46.9 cents in
February and 54.4 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.30 in February
and $12.50 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 27.5 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
25.7 cents in February and 29.1 cents a year ago.

   The National Association of Wheat Growers says
its producers should receive incentives from the Agriculture
Department to sell grain on the open market rather than have to
forfeit it to the government when price support loans come due.
   Frank Johannsen, association president, said Wednesday that
wheat producers deserve the same kind of consideration given corn
producers who are being allowed to keep their grain under federal
price support for an additional year.
   That was a reference to Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng's
announcement Tuesday that price support loans for some old-crop
corn and sorghum will be extended a year longer than their normal
maturity dates.
   Johannsen, a Bayard, Neb., wheat farmer, said in a statement
released here that the association is ``seeking a way to encourage
growers to settle their maturing loans'' by paying them off with
generic certificates.
   The certificates are issued by USDA as payment-in-kind under
crop programs and can be exchanged for surplus commodities owned by
the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   If the price support loans are not repaid, a farmer must forfeit
the grain to the CCC, which cancels the debt.
   Once the CCC takes over the grain, it must be moved into
government storage. Much of the CCC wheat is currently being sold
back into the market in weekly auctions.
   ``Since current estimates are that it costs the government at
least 20 cents a bushel to move, store, catalog and exchange
forfeited wheat through weekly auctions, our proposal won't cost
anything extra and it will reduce some of the government's
logistical problems,'' Johannsen said. ``It has the added benefit
of keeping wheat moving in the pipeline of our much-improved
market.''
   Besides, he said, grain farmers ``have a right to expect
even-handed treatment'' from the department.

<HEAD>Teamsters Win Right To Try To Organize Coors Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Teamsters Union has eliminated a rival in
trying to unionize the once bitterly anti-union Adolph Coors Co.
after organizing Anheuser-Busch's newest brewery just two weeks ago.
   The AFL-CIO on Wednesday awarded sole organizing rights to the
Teamsters at Coors' lead brewery at Golden, Colo., less than 50
miles away from the new Anheuser-Busch facility at Fort Collins,
Colo.
   The labor federation ordered one of its veteran affiliates, the
Machinists Union, to withdraw from its campaign to organize the
same 3,200 Coors workers, saying the Teamsters had a much better
chance of succeeding.
   The decision was an outgrowth of the Teamsters' decision last
October to reaffiliate their 1.6 million members with the AFL-CIO.
The union was expelled from the federation 30 years earlier on
charges of corruption.
   A major factor in the AFL-CIO's decision to readmit the
Teamsters was ending the expensive fights and membership raids that
the two organizations constantly waged against each other. Many
employers often were able to avoid collective bargaining altogether
by playing one union against the other.
   The AFL-CIO last September had awarded the sole organizing
rights at Coors to the Machinists. The Teamsters had challenged
that ruling as soon as they were re-admitted to the federation last
Nov. 1.
   Coors, in the face of an intensive organizing effort by the
Teamsters since early 1986, last August signed an agreement with
the AFL-CIO ending a 10-year-old nationwide boycott of its beer by
the labor movement.
   In exchange, the company agreed to forgo erecting the usual
legal hurdles available to employers in opposing unions and allow
an AFL-CIO affiliate an unfettered attempt to organize its Golden
work force.
   However, that was before the Teamsters were back in the AFL-CIO.
And Teamsters officials admitted they now have concerns now about
how the Coors-AFL-CIO pact will hold up in the face of Wednesday's
action.
   ``We're elated,'' said Charles Klare, director of the Teamsters'
100,000-member brewery and soft drinks division. ``But there's a
lot to be found out yet. We've got to meet with Coors and determine
if they accept the fact that the AFL-CIO picked us.''
   The Machinists Union had argued before an arbitrator picked by
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland that the Teamsters should give up
the Coors effort based on last September's decision.
   The Teamsters countered they had an ongoing organizing campaign
at Coors a year before the Machinists entered the picture and had
gotten signatures on Teamster union cards from more than 30 percent
of the workers at Golden.
   Kirkland agreed with the Teamsters, according to witnesses at
the arbitration proceedings.
   ``It was a black-and-white case,'' said Vicki Saporta, the
Teamsters' director of organizing. ``We were there first and they
didn't have a single card signed. We're also the predominant union
in the industry. We have contracts at all 12 Anheuser-Busch
breweries covering some 9,000 workers.''
   Ms. Saporta said the Teamsters have another tactical advantage
in that it also has union contracts representing employees of more
than 180 local distributors of Coors' products nationwide.
   The Teamsters just last week ratified a new contract with
Anheuser-Busch raising the base pay for brewery production workers
from its current $16.50 an hour to $17.25 over the next three years.
   Just a week earlier, the union won a an organizing effort at
Anheuser-Busch's newest facility at Fort Collins to represent its
current work force of about 340 people, which is expected to grow
to 550 by next January.
   ``That was one of the factors the arbitrator took into
consideration,'' Klare said. ``Coors workers are averaging about
$3.50 to $4 an hour less than our members. Seeing how fellow
workers down the road are doing gives them a big incentive to come
in.''

   People who have been putting off writing
letters may want to get busy before Sunday, when the cost of
sending one rises to a quarter from 22 cents.
   The 14 percent increase in the price of first-class mail is
less, however, than the 18 percent increase for mailing newspapers
and magazines and the 25 percent increase for advertising mail.
   The rate increases, proposed last May, were designed to avoid
continuing losses by the Postal Service, officials said. The agency
was more than $220 million in the red last year.
   Some 6 billion ``E'' stamps have been distributed to post
offices across the nation to fill the gap until new 25-cent stamps
can be printed. The new stamps, without any price on them, are good
only for use within the country.
   They have no denomination because they had to be printed ahead
of time, before officials knew what new rate would be approved by
the indpendent Postal Rate Commission.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank has ordered post offices to
extend their hours during the next two weeks to help in the
changeover.
   Stamps are also being sold by mail and telephone. Phone orders,
by credit card, can be made by calling 1-800-STAMP24. There is a $2
service charge.
   Here are some examples of the new rates:
   _First-class letters:
   First ounce, 25 cents; additional ounces 20 cents. Up from 22
cents and 17 cents.
   Presorted by ZIP code, 21 cents. Up from 18 cents.

   Contra rebels said they attacked
Sandinista soldiers in two areas of the country in violation of a
temporary truce that is to be expanded into a 60-day cease-fire on
Friday.
   But the rebels' chief field commander said on Wednesday he
supports the peace accord with the leftist Sandinista government
that brought the truce.
   The two sides have not yet agreed on logistics of the
cease-fire, during which the roughly 10,000 Contra fighters are to
move into five zones while a lasting peace agreement is negotiated.
Talks resume Tuesday.
   A transcript of a Wednesday broadcast by the rebels'
Honduras-based Radio September 15 said rebels attacked in Zelaya
province along the Caribbean coast and in the central province of
Matagalpa province. It did not say when.
   ``Nicaraguan Resistance commandos cause casualties to the
pro-Soviet army,'' the transcript quoted the broadcast as saying.
   The pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario quoted military
sources as saying Contras killed four civilians and kidnapped two
on Saturday in the central province of Chontales.
   The Defense Ministry said on Wednesday it had no reports of
combat.
   Other reports have indicated rebels opposed to the cease-fire
agreement were staging attacks.
   However, Col. Enrique Bermudez, the chief Contra military field
commander, said Wednesday in Miami that he supports the peace
accord and will comply with it, despite his reservations. He has
said he doesn't trust the Sandinistas.
   ``We understand there can be differences, but during
negotiations we have to have a single position,'' he told a news
conference.
   In talks Monday and Tuesday, representatives of the government
and the U.S.-backed Contras agreed on the general locations of five
zones where the Contras are to begin gathering Friday. But they did
not further define the areas or work out the mechanics of how the
rebels will move into the zones.
   The preliminary peace accord signed March 23 in the southern
border town of Sapoa says the rebels may accept only humanitarian
aid from a neutral organization, such as the Red Cross, during the
period. But it does not say if they must lay down their weapons, an
issue that is expected to come up in the technical meeting in Sapoa
on Tuesday or in a meeting of high-ranking representatives of both
sides in Managua on Wednesday.
   In Washington, the House on Wednesday approved a $48 million
package of humanitarian aid for the Contras and for children
injured in the fighting. The Senate was to consider the measure
today and there was a chance it could be law before Congress
adjourns for Easter recess.
   U.S. aid to the Contras expired Feb. 29 and Contra leaders said
President Reagan's failure to secure them continued military
support in Congress contributed to their decision to sign the peace
accord.
   The six-year war was secondary in the minds of most Nicaraguans
this week. Banks, government offices, stores and most restaurants
closed for Holy Week vacations and residents headed for Pacific
coast beaches or other resort spots.
   Many first had to search for gasoline which is in short supply.
   La Prensa, the opposition newspaper, stopped publishing for the
week, citing a shortage of Soviet-supplied newsprint. The two
government papers printed their last edition for the week on
Wednesday.
   State-run television planned special broadcasts, including the
films ``Jesus of Nazareth'' and ``Ben Hur.'' Movie theaters in the
capital were showing ``Annie Hall,'' ``The Godfather,'' ``The Deer
Hunter,'' ``Amadeus,'' and ``Chariots of Fire,'' all with Spanish
subtitles.

<HEAD>Agenda Cites Shultz-Weinberger Opposition To Iran-Contra Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Documents just released by the congressional
Iran-Contra committees include a handwritten note offering new
evidence that Cabinet-level opposition to the Iran arms deal was on
the agenda of a January 1986 meeting attended by Vice President
George Bush.
   The vice president has maintained he was not aware of the
concerns of then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Secretary
of State George Shultz until much later.
   Had he been aware of their objections, Bush has said, he might
have advised the president against the sale. ``When you don't know
something, it's hard to react. We were not in the loop,'' Bush said
last August.
   Among documents released Wednesday was an agenda penned by
then-National Security Adviser John Poindexter for his Jan. 17,
1986, briefing of President Reagan and Bush. It includes an item
that states ``Shultz & Weinberger still recommend against.''
   The agenda also states that Attorney General Edwin Meese III and
the late CIA Director William Casey ``approve,'' and lists a ``new
finding'' _ or document to authorize the covert arms sales.
   Reagan signed the document that day.
   The scrawled 26-word agenda is marked ``Done'' at the top.
   Bush in January said this of the meeting: ``The president may
have signed a finding but there was no discussion of a finding in
front of me. I do not recall any suggestion of a finding that day.''
   Bush maintains that specific details were not discussed in the
briefing, which he considered to be an informal session, The
Washington Post reported today, citing an unidentified aide to the
vice president contacted Wednesday.
   The newspaper noted that a memo released earlier and related to
the same meeting stated that ``the secretaries do not recommend you
proceed with this plan.'' That memo, prepared for the president,
carried a Poindexter notation that Reagan had been briefed orally
and that Bush was among those present.
   Poindexter is among those under indictment in the Iran-Contra
affair.

   Jesse Jackson, answering critics who say he
lacks the government experience to be president, says ``Some
leaders don't hold office.''
   The Democratic presidential candidate also accused fellow
hopeful Albert Gore Jr. of personal attacks on him, a day after
Gore said Jackson lacked the qualifications for the presidency.
   Jackson returned to a site of his activism last year to
emphasize Wednesday that his personal style of leadership has been
in the streets, not in the government halls.
   ``Leadership stands with the people in the time of crisis,'' he
told about a 1,000 people at St. Frederick's Church here late
Wednesday. ``I stood with the people ... I stood with the P-40
workers in Cudahy.''
   Almost exactly a year ago _ on Palm Sunday 1987 _ Jackson
marched in the streets of this Milwaukee suburb to protest
management's actions in the strike of the United Food and
Commercial Workers local at the Patrick Cudahy meatpacking plant
here.
   Workers went on strike on Jan. 4, 1987, and are still out.
Replacement workers have been hired, but the company, owned by
Smithfield Foods, is trying to reoganize under the backruptcy laws.
   ``In your time of crisis, you called out to me and I
responded,'' Jackson told the crowd. ``In the time of this nation's
crisis, I want to be your president and I need your help.''
   Jackson began a three-day Wisconsin campaign swing Wednesday
after a day of private meetings in Washington with key leaders of
the party's Washington establishment and with campaign aides. He
planned a full day of campaigning across the state both today and
Saturday.
   ``Some officeholders are leaders. Some leaders don't hold
office,'' he said. ``But leaders stand with the people in the hour
of hardship and challenge.''
   On Tuesday, fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee attacked Jackson for lacking the requisite experience to
be president, and criticized his foreign policy views.
   On Wednesday, Jackson said he viewed Gore's comments as
``attacks, which were more personal than principled.'' The two were
to meet, but it fell through.
   Gore, told of Jackson's remark, asked: ``Is there supposed to be
some unwritten rule why Jesse Jackson cannot be criticized, why his
positions have to be just sacrosanct and nobody can say anything
about them for fear somebody will just misinterpret what you're
saying?''
   Jackson did not refer to Gore directly in his speech, but he did
tell reporters that he will lay his differences with the other
candidates as appropriate.
   ``If there are distinctions, I will discuss them,'' Jackson said.
   He emphasized that he wanted to keep his message positive and
pledged not to engage in personal attacks.
   But Gerald Austin, Jackson's campaign manager, told reporters on
the plane that Gore ``is the Democratic bully'' who has attacked
other candidates before. Austin derided Gore for saying
complimentary things about Jackson in a Monday debate and then
criticizing Jackson the next day.
   ``Gore doesn't deserve your attention or ours until he starts
winning some votes _ or at least breaks into double digits,''
Austin said of Gore's recently poor showing in primaries.
   Jackson's speech at the Cudahy church laid out more specifically
than before his definition of leadership.
   ``I have learned to lead in the gap ... the leadership gap in
the White House and the Executive Office building,'' he said.
``When the drugs flow into our country, Mrs. Reagan just says no.
Mr. Bush just says nothing. Mr. Reagan does nothing.
   ``I led the drive to ban drugs and to ban guns,'' Jackson said.
Jackson listed a variety of his previous actions as demonstrations
of leadership. He mentioned his ``standing with the auto workers at
Kenosha'' Wis., where Chrysler closed a plant shortly after
promising to keep it open for several more years. He talked of
standing with family farmers at foreclosure sales.
   He talked of his leadership in the fight against South Africa
and in personally asking Soviet leaders to improve human rights in
that nation.
   Jackson refered to his campaign as featuring ``a clear message
and an authentic leader who speaks directly to the people.''

   The dollar dropped nearly one yen against the
Japanese currency in Tokyo trading Thursday, while stock prices
declined slightly after three days of substantial gains.
   The dollar opened at 125.15 yen and slumped to 124.50 yen at the
close, down 0.93 yen from Wednesday's close of 125.43 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which rose 366.89 points on Wednesday to a
post-crash high, slipped 59.81 points, closing at 26,260.26 points.
   ``Fiscal year-end demand for dollars, which supported the dollar
in early trading, has come to an end,'' said an official of a major
commercial bank in Tokyo, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
Japanese fiscal year ends Thursday.
   On the stock exchange, traders said the market has come to a
rest after three days of sharp gains.
   The Nikkei Stock Average surged more than 1,000 points in the
previous three sessions. Wednesday's close of the stock market's
key barometer was 26,319.98 points, the first close above 26,000
since last October's market crash.

<HEAD>Iran Boosts Fuel Imports As Tanker War Takes Its Toll</HEAD>

   Iraqi air raids on Iran's refineries and
tankers in recent weeks appear to be taking an increasing toll on
Tehran's vital oil industry as the Persian Gulf war escalates
sharply.
   Shipping analysts believe the Iraqis will intensify air strikes
aimed at throttling Iran's oil exports while hammering Tehran and
other cities in a drive to pressure Iran to the negotiating table.
   ``We can't see an end to the tanker war,'' Eric Ramheim of the
Oslo-based International Association of Independent Tanker Owners
said.
   ``We had hoped the tanker war was coming to an end after a
recent lull, but the situation is worse now than it's been for a
long time. You think it's reached a peak, and then it just gets
worse,'' he said in a phone interview.
   Iran, one of the world's major oil producers, is having to
import record amounts of refined petroleum products, such as
kerosene and jet fuel, the Middle East Economic Survey reported
this week.
   ``This unprecedented sudden import of gas oil could be due to
damage inflicted on Iranian refineries because of the war,'' the
respected oil industry newsletter noted.
   But it noted as well that Tehran may also be ``taking
precautionary measures and stocking up these products in
anticipation of a further escalation in the war.''
   The sudden surge in refined imports has strategic implications
in the 7{-year-old war. It coincides with an unprecedented Iraqi
missile bombardment of Tehran and other key cities over the last
month.
   The Iranians may fear their battered refineries could be knocked
out altogether.
   The Economic Survey, a weekly published in Nicosia, said the
Iranians have chartered a 200,000-ton tanker from West Germany's
Marimpex trading company to deliver a full load of gas oil _ more
than 2 million barrels _ from Rotterdam next month.
   The Iranians have already taken delivery of nearly 3 million
42-gallon barrels of gas oil in recent weeks, industry sources
noted.
   That is a massive increase over the 300,000 barrels a day it has
been importing for the last 18 months. Recent Iraqi air raids have
reduced Iran's domestic refining capacity by as much as one-third.
   A large formation of Iraqi fighter-bombers attacked Iran's big
Kharg Island oil terminal in the northern end of the gulf on March
19, badly damaging two of the estimated 25 tankers that shuttle oil
to makeshift terminals farther south for transshipment to delivery
tankers.
   The 316,379-ton Avaj and the 249,829-ton Sanandaj were left in
flames with 50 crewmen killed. Shipping sources said both vessels
were so badly hit they will likely be scrapped.
   The loading facilities on Kharg, heavily defended by
anti-aircraft missile batteries, also were damaged, the economic
survey said.
   The main systems on the west of the island were knocked out in
the bombing, forcing the Iranians to switch loading to a smaller
jetty, slowing down exports that are Tehran's main source of
revenue for its war effort.
   Several other shuttle tankers, either owned by the state-run
National Iranian Tanker Co., or chartered by it, are believed to
have been put out of action in recent Iraqi air strikes.
   ``The Iraqis are the key,'' stressed Ramheim, of the
International Association of Independent Tanker Owners. ``Now
they're attacking again, we think the situation's going to get
worse because Iran always retaliates.''
   Because Iraq's gulf ports have been closed since the early days
of the war, the Iranians have to take revenge by attacking neutral
ships.
   After Iraq reported three air strikes on Iranian tankers,
Iranian gunboats on Monday attacked a Danish supertanker and a
Norwegian-operated tanker, setting both ablaze.
   London-based Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit says 4.7 million
tons of shipping has been sunk or written off since December
because of the tanker war. That includes the 280,000-ton Iranian
tanker Susangird, which went down after it was set on fire by Iraqi
Exocet missiles, killing 21 crewmen.
   Altogether, about 15 million tons of shipping has been lost
since 1981, Lloyd's and other agencies reported. That's more than
half the 24 million tons of merchant shipping sunk in World War II.
   Iran must ship its oil exports through the gulf, where its
tankers are prey to marauding Iraqi jets. Iraq exports its oil
through pipelines across neighboring Turkey and Saudi Arabia which
are far less vulnerable to attack.

<HEAD>Fired Weight Inspector Gets State Job Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB IMRIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fired truck weight inspector, who was so
large the Highway Patrol weighed him on a truck scale, got his
state job back and the patrol got a scolding for being biased
against fat people.
   The state Personnel Board unanimously ruled Wednesday that
Melvin Hansen's weight had not affected his work and that he was
discriminated against when Highway Patrol Superintendent Brian Berg
fired him July 31.
   The board ordered that Hansen, 48, receive back pay, which his
lawyer said totaled about $15,000.
   When he was fired, Hansen weighed 463 pounds, according to
testimony.
   State Insurance Commissioner Earl Pomeroy, chairman of the
five-member Personnel Board, said the importance the patrol placed
on Hansen's weight was discriminatory because it was not related to
his job performance.
   Assistant Attorney General Sandra Warren said the patrol would
appeal the ruling.
   Hansen, a truck weight inspector since 1977, lost his job at a
weigh station near the Minnesota border where he weighed trucks and
inspected cargo.
   A letter to Hansen listed his lack of control over his weight,
his inability to wear agency uniforms and his body odor as reasons
for his dismissal.
   Hansen did not attend the three-hour hearing Wednesday ``because
everybody wanted to see how big he was,'' said his attorney, Hal
Stutsman. ``His appearance would have only served to satisfy
curiosity.''
   Stutsman refused to give Hansen's current weight, putting it
somewhere between 320 and 463 pounds.
   The patrol once weighed Hansen on a truck scale, according to
testimony at the hearing.
   The action was dehumanizing and showed ``a shocking lack of
sensitivity and crass attitude on the part of Mr. Hansen's
supervisor,'' said state Personnel Division analyst Bonny Fetch,
who recommended Hansen's full reinstatement.
   The board's decision underscores that no state employee can be
dismissed for a weight problem unless weight standards are
necessary to do the job, Fetch said.

<HEAD>Education Department Says Smaller Classes Will Worsen Teacher
Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Education Department study says the
workload for secondary school teachers has ``never been lighter''
and efforts to reduce class size in hopes of spurring student
achievement are probably misguided.
   The study released Wednesday estimated it could cost up to $69
billion a year and require the hiring of 1 million new teachers to
reduce the typical class size from 24 to 15 students.
   It suggested school reformers look for ways to help teachers do
a better job of managing the children in their classrooms rather
than ``sink vast sums'' into efforts to reduce class size.
   The report, ``Class Size and Public Policy: Politics and
Panaceas,'' said efforts to boost students' test scores through
smaller classes ``will probably be a waste of money and effort.''
   The report was based on a review of past studies, not on any new
classroom research.
   There now are 24 pupils in the typical public elementary school
classroom, down from 30 in 1961. In secondary schools, the typical
class size is down from 27 to 22.
   The report by Tommy M. Tomlinson of the department's Office of
Educational Research and Improvement said, ``Smaller classes will
worsen the shortage of both teachers and classrooms.''
   ``If teachers today believe that the number of students per
class is too large and their workload too heavy, it is also true
that the number of students they teach has never been fewer and,
from that standpoint, their workload has never been lighter,'' it
said.
   The report noted several states, including Indiana, have made
smaller class size in the early grades a key ingredient of their
school reform efforts.
   Chester E. Finn Jr., the assistant secretary of education in
charge of research, said lowering class size has become ``an ersatz
reform goal around the country.''
   ``There are a lot of better and less costly things you can do
and get results,'' Finn said in an interview. ``There's no question
that good teachers in tiny classes are one of the reasons people
pay for expensive private schools. But it's not a very prudent
investment strategy if you're trying to improve the vast enterprise
of American education.''
   The National Education Association, the 1.85 million-member
teachers union, has a policy that states, ``excellence in the
classroom can best be attained by small class size,'' and it urges
affiliates to ``seek an optimum class size of 15 students.''
   Keith Geiger, the NEA's vice president, said in an interview:
``It is very expensive to lower it to 15, but they continually use
this rationale for doing nothing. We have elementary teachers out
there sitting with 38, 40, 42 kids in their class. That's the sad
part.''
   He said Utah and California have some of the most crowded
classrooms.
   ``We've got to move to less than 20-to-1 in the early elementary
grades if we're ever going to expect to reach these kids so we
don't have to spend all the money on remediation when they get into
junior and senior high school,'' Geiger said.
   The report, however, emphasized that Japan has achieved the
world's highest math achievement scores with math classes that
average 41 pupils.
   It said reducing the size of the typical class from 24 to 23
pupils would require 73,000 more teachers and cost $5 billion,
``not counting the expenses of building more classrooms.'' A
reduction to 20 students would require 335,000 new teachers and
cost $22.8 billion.
   Although teacher salaries average $26,500 nationally plus
fringes and benefits, the study estimated the overall cost of each
new teacher at $68,295.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Criticize Policy Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 800 Chinese students studying in the
United States have signed their names to an open letter opposing
China's policy to sharply reduce the number of students abroad, a
student organizer said today.
   ``We have had an overwhelming response from fellow students
across the country,'' said Pei Minxin, a 30-year-old doctoral
candidate at Harvard University. ``It's been a mixture of shock,
anger and action.''
   At a meeting late Wednesday at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, about 300 Chinese students shouted down a Chinese
consular official who came from New York to explain the policy,
said two Chinese sources speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``It was democracy in action,'' one source said.
   The letter, which appeared in Chinese-language newspapers across
the United States on Tuesday and Wednesday, said the policy would
hurt China's drive to modernize its economy.
   ``The recent unreasonable changes in the policies on overseas
study are fundamentally in conflict with the declared national
policy of reform and open door,'' read the letter, which was
translated by The Associated Press.
   The policy will also force many Chinese students in America to
return to China before obtaining their degrees, the letter said.
   The document was accompanied by the names and phone numbers of
21 Chinese students and a request for student supporters to add
their names to the list. By early today, more than 800 students had
done so, Pei said.
   Currently, about 40,000 Chinese students are studying abroad,
27,000 of them in the United States. Last year, 8,000 students came
to the United States from the People's Republic of China.
   Under the new policy, only 600 Chinese would be sent to America,
according to Chinese news reports, an official document seen in New
York and Chinese students who quoted government officials.
   Time limits on students studying abroad would also be imposed,
said the document, which was obtained from Chinese sources. That
rule could be particularly difficult for many Chinese, who need
time to master a foreign language before studying their specialty.
   A spokesman at China's embassy in Washington acknowledged
Wednesday that fewer students would be sent abroad, but denied
there has been a policy change.
   At the MIT meeting, the unidentified consular official confirmed
that a time limit had been placed on studies, the sources said.
``He said we have two years to do a masters (degree) and four or
five to get our Ph.D.,'' one source said.
   The policy is the result of a struggle between Chinese Premier
Li Peng and Communist Party Chairman Zhao Ziyang, said Boston
University history professor Merle Goldman.
   Zhao backs an ``open-door policy'' and increasingly liberal
economic reform. Li, a Soviet-educated engineer, wants to limit
China's contact with the West, and is concerned that Chinese
students studying abroad are becoming too Westernized, Ms. Goldman
said.
   When Chinese students come home, she said, ``they are already
infected by the political values of the United States. They absorb
Western political ideas and that could be troublesome for the
Chinese state.''
   At MIT, the official told students that China has felt the need
for more control over its students since January 1987, when more
than 1,000 Chinese nationals in America signed an open letter to
Beijing opposing conservative policies in their homeland, the
sources said.
   At that point a Chinese student jumped up and yelled, ``Control?
What do you mean by control. What kind of word is that?'' the
sources said.
   Zhang Longxi, a 40-year-old doctoral candidate at Harvard, said
he did not see the letter as a political statement.
   ``It is a bread-and-butter issue for me,'' he said. ``I need
time to study comparative literature.''
   ``We are only asking that the right to study and complete our
degrees be restored to us,'' Pei said.

   Novelist John Clellon Holmes, the
first to describe 1950s youth as a ``beat'' generation, died of
cancer. He was 62.
   Holmes, who died Wednesday, was a companion of Jack Kerouac,
Allen Ginsburg, William Burroughs and other chroniclers of the
``beat'' lifestyle in New York City after World War II.
   His first novel, ``Go,'' published in 1952, was about the beat
world, and appeared five years before Kerouac's more popular
beatnik novel, ``On The Road.''
   Holmes, a Holyoke, Mass., native, who was also a poet and a
critic, wrote more about the period and its philosophy in ``Nothing
More To Declare,'' published in 1967.
   However, he criticized the beatniks' 1960s successors, the
hippies, saying they had a ``fad culture'' characterized by ``a
feeling of helplessness.''
   Holmes became a visiting lecturer at the University of Arkansas
in 1957. In 1966, he became the school's first writer-in-residence.
He also taught at Yale, the University of Iowa, Bowling Green
University and Brown University. Holmes retired from teaching in
1986.
   ``Displaced Person: The Travel Essays of John Clellon Holmes,''
was published earlier this month by the University of Arkansas
Press.
   Holmes is survived by his wife, Shirley Allen Holmes; his mother
and two sisters.

<TEXT>
   The opposition today accused the
government of concealing massive corruption involving hundreds of
millions of dollars and demanded former President Chun Doo-hwan be
questioned about missing funds.
   The country's two main opposition parties claimed the government
had limited the scope of a probe into alleged corruption by Chun's
younger brother, charging information about the Chun family's
activities was being suppressed.
   ``The government has orchestrated another cover-up and fooled
the people,'' the Reunification Democratic Party charged.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy demanded President Chun be
questioned about allegations of widespread corruption under his
government and called for a full investigation.
   The governing Democratic Justice Party denied there was any
attempt to cover up corruption and said it was determined to expose
any official wrongdoing.
   The former president's brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was charged
early today with embezzling $10.4 million as head of Saemaul Undong
(New Community), a semi-official development program.
   The younger Chun, who was taken to a Seoul prison in handcuffs,
also was charged with taking bribes, influence peddling, evading
taxes and violation of business, land and construction laws.
   If convicted under special laws covering massive public fraud,
Chun could receive a sentence ranging from 10 years in prison to
death.
   Ten other people, including aides of the younger Chun and senior
Saemaul officials, also were indicted on embezzlement, bribery,
influence peddling and corruption charges, officials said.
   The other suspects include Chun Kyung-hwan's two brothers-in-law.
   The opposition charged that the younger Chun and his associates
had embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars, and the government
was concealing evidence to prevent a political backlash.
   Chief Prosecutor Kang Won-il said the younger Chun amassed a
fortune in money, land and stocks by using government and family
connections during the seven years he headed Saemaul.
   The former president had appointed him to the post.
   ``It is agonizing to me that I have caused trouble to my
brother,'' the younger Chun was quoted as saying by prosecutors.
   Kang said the younger Chun diverted government and Saemaul
funds, pressured corporations into making illegal donations,
arranged to get private businesses government contracts and
permits, and misappropriated land and buildings built with
government funds.
   Kang said the investigation was centering on charges Chun
diverted huge sums of money overseas for land speculation in the
United States and Australia. The prosecutor said the probe was
continuing and further revelations were expected.
   Saemaul was founded in 1971 to promote urban and rural
development. The younger Chun resigned as its chief in 1987 after
being linked to gangsters.
   Prosecutors are questioning government officials about charges
they aided or concealed Saemaul corruption to protect the former
president and his family.
   Former President Chun, who left office Feb. 25 after seven years
in power, has not been implicated in the Saemaul affair. He is on a
private American tour and met last week with President Reagan.

   Several of the largest insurance companies are
offering sharp discounts in premiums for drivers of cars with air
bags, the safety devices that inflate and protect a driver in a
serious accident.
   USAA, the country's sixth largest insurance company, announced
Wednesday a premium discount of up to 60 percent for personal
injury and medical coverage for air bag-equipped cars.
   The company also said it would contribute $300 to the purchase
or lease of a 1988 car equipped with an air bag.
   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. on Tuesday announced
a premium discount of from $3 to $24 for cars equipped with air
bags or passive belts, which automatically wrap around a car
occupant.
   Robert F. McDermott, chairman of USAA, told a news conference he
expected air bags to be available as an option or standard
equipment in several million cars within the next 18 months.
   The auto industry in the past has complained that while
insurance companies have campaigned to get air bags into cars they
have not offered car owners financial incentives to order the
safety devices.

<HEAD>Census-OMB Settle on 1990 Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispute between government agencies over the
questions to be asked on the 1990 Census has been settled, before
Friday's deadline for reporting to Congress.
   The Census Bureau reported Wednesday that it had settled its
differences with the White House Office of Management and Budget
over how many households would receive the longer, more detailed
form to obtain the national head count.
   OMB had wanted to reduce paperwork by deleting some questions
and reducing the number of people who get the more complex long
form.
   The two agencies have agreed that all 106 million households in
the nation will be sent the short form, while the more detailed
long form will go to 17.7 million. Census had wanted to sent it to
nearly 20 million households, OMB to limit it to 10 million.
   Short form questions on plumbing facilities and condominiums
will be switched to the long form, as OMB suggested. But other
questions will be retained, including the cost of uilities.
   Some things that were asked in the 1980 census will be dropped
in 1990. These include employment five years earlier, marital
history, weeks spent looking for work, number of bathrooms, air
conditioning and heating equipment, presence of an elevator and
type of fuel used for cooking and heating water.

<HEAD>Navy Secretary Takes Oath of Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Ball has become the nation's 67th
secretary of the Navy, pledging to keep his forces ``strong and
prepared'' to meet any challenge.
   Standing in an ornate Old Executive Office Building room first
used by Navy Secretary Richard Thompson in 1879, Ball said
Wednesday that by maintaining military strength, the United States
``preserve the peace and ultimately extend the special gift that is
freedom the world over.''
   President Reagan, making remarks at the swearing-in ceremony for
his former legislative liaison, said Ball had ``won the respect of
the leaders of both parties.'' He said ``I've repeatedly turned''
to Ball for help and advice in recent years.
   White House chief of staff Howard Baker swore in Ball as several
Cabinet officers, members of Congress and military officers looked
on. After Thompson, who served under President Rutherford B. Hayes,
14 Navy secretaries used the room, heavily decorated in naval motif.

<HEAD>Sears to Halt Lawn Dart Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. has agreed to halt
sales of lawn darts, following a federal complaint about the
potentially dangerous sports items, according to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
   Sears agreed in a consent decree to stop selling lawn darts
within a week, the commission said Wedenesday.
   The decree settles charges that the nationwide retailer offered
lawn darts for sale without required warning labels and in areas
near toy sales.
   ``Sears' prompt response to the commission's concerns should
serve as an example for manufacturers and other retailers of lawn
darts,'' said commission Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon.
   Lawn darts are an outdoor game in which large, pointed darts are
tossed at targets on the ground. They can pose a serious hazard,
with three deaths reported in the last 18 years and an estimated
670 annual injuries, the safety agency said.
   The agency asked that consumers report injuries or improper
sales of lawn darts by calling it at 1-800-638-2772.

<TEXT>
   Someday, doctors will have a system for
identifying stress-plagued patients who are headed for heart
trouble even though their blood pressure readings may look normal,
says a heart researcher.
   Dr. Robert S. Eliot, a cardiovascular researcher from Denver,
told cardiologists meeting in Atlanta this week that new ways of
testing can identify ``hot reactors'' _ stressed but seemingly
healthy people.
   ``These are people who fight saber-toothed tigers 30, 40 times a
day and don't even know it,'' Eliot told reporters Wednesday at the
annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology.
   ``A doctor can't tell from resting blood pressure (tests taken
at rest),'' he said, adding that conventional blood pressure
readings don't tell how much blood is pumping or how much
resistance the heart is fighting.
   Eliot, director of the cardiovascular institute at Denver's
Swedish Medical Center, has worked 10 years on ways to measure the
rapid, stress-induced fluctuations in the cardiovascular system.
   That work, he said, has yielded a 30-minute test using devices
to monitor heart performance, blood pressure and other factors to
find ``hot reactors,'' who apparently make up more than 10 percent
of the population.
   With so many seemingly healthy people at risk of illness, within
three to eight months in some cases, he said, ``I think it's worth
testing in people.''
   Eliot and his colleagues plan to expand their efforts to three
other locations next year. Someday soon, he hopes, physicians will
agree on a standard way of conducting such stress tests.
   ``We have a model,'' he said. ``It's been successful.''
   Those efforts are part of what Eliot terms ``a new kind of
medicine,'' emphasizing not just technical medical techniques, but
beneficial lifestyle adjustments. Some, he noted, have called it
``medicine from the 21st century _ teaching people what they can do
for themselves.''
   ``Drugs and surgery are not sufficient for most people'' with
cardiovascular problems, said Dr. Dean Ornish, an assistant
professor at the University of California at San Francisco School
of Medicine and president of the Preventative Medicine Research
Institute.
   ``Cardiology has tended to ignore the role of the brain on the
heart,'' Ornish said.

<TEXT>
   The grandson of a former University of
Texas football coach has been charged with stealing a missing page
of Albert Einstein's notes from a locked display case at the
school, police said.
   Samuel K. Royal, 18, was arrested Wednesday evening at his
Austin apartment, said Ronald Thomas, a university police
lieutenant.
   The page of handwritten notes, owned by the university, was
reported missing last week from a locked glass case on the fourth
floor of the Peter T. Flawn Academic Center. It was among six pages
on display from a series addressing the mathematical concept of
Euclidean rotation.
   Investigators said a telephoned tip led them to the younger
Royal's apartment Tuesday where the page was found in a photo
album, along with photographs of his grandfather, Darrell Royal,
the University of Texas' football coach from 1957 through 1976.
   Samuel Royal is not a university student. His father, Mack
Davis, is a custodian on the same floor of the academic center
where the display case was located.
   According to a court affidavit, a woman named Alissa Chambers,
who also lives at the apartment where the page was discovered, said
Samuel Royal ``walked in and flashed some papers in front of my
face and said, `These are the writings of Albert Einstein.'''
   Police could not immediately offer an explanation for the theft.
The display case was locked and the glass unbroken when the
document was discovered missing.
   The missing page is part of an archive of 60 or 70 pages ``upon
which Einstein wrote the notes representing his thinking as he was
trying to work out his theories near the end of his life,'' said
John Chalmers, librarian for UT's Harry Ransom Humanities Research
Center.
   The university has owned the papers for 25 years. Einstein
apparently wrote the notes several years before he died in 1955.
   Although the page likely could have been sold for a couple of
thousand dollars, Chalmers said, its value far exceeds that amount.
   ``For all of us, it's a piece of our heritage, and it is not to
be replaced. In that sense, it has no price,'' Chalmers said.
   Darrell Royal, who is special assistant to the president of the
university, did not return a telephone call to his Austin residence
on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Lady Carroll Bing, wife of opera impresario Sir
Rudolf Bing, was arrested outside Carnegie Hall for failing to
appear in court on charges she slapped an executive of a performing
arts management company.
   The arrest on 57th Street on Wednesday was the latest in a
series of legal entanglements for the couple.
   Lady Bing, 48, has been visiting Columbia Artists Management's
midtown Manhattan office frequently, often with her 86-year-old
husband, according to police.
   She was apparently upset that her husband, general manager of
the Metropolitan Opera from 1950 to 1972, had been dropped from
Columbia Artists' board of directors, police said. Columbia Artists
represents classical music artists and produces classical concerts.
   Lady Bing was arrested on a bench warrant issued after she
failed to appear in court Monday to answer charges of criminal
trespass and harassment, according to Detective Joseph McConville.
   The charges were filed last month by Barbara Quinones, vice
president for administration at Columbia Artists, who claimed that
Lady Bing entered her office without permission, harassed her and
slapped her face.
   Why Lady Bing returned to Columbia's offices Wednesday was not
known, McConville said.
   Ms. Quinones and her attorney, Todd Steckler, refused to comment
on the arrest.
   Shortly after the Bings' wedding 14 months ago, state Supreme
Court Justice Arthur Blyn declared that Bing suffered from
Alzheimer's disease and was unable to control his $900,000 estate.
   The judge appointed a conservator, barred Lady Bing from
spending her husband's assets and allowed Bing's lawyers to begin
annulment proceedings. A pretrial hearing on the annulment
proceedings is set for May 3.
   Bing said last year that he loved his wife and that he believed
allegations by longtime friends that she was misspending his money
were wrong.
   Blyn ordered Lady Bing not to take her husband out of the
court's jurisdiction.
   However, she took him to Florida and the West Indian island of
Anguilla. The couple disappeared before turning up in Great
Britain. They returned to New York late last year.
   In 1982, a Washington court found that Lady Bing, then Carroll
Douglass, was incapable of managing her own affairs, and appointed
as conservators her brother and sister.
   Bing, born in Vienna, Austria, went to Britain in the 1930s,
where he headed the Glyndebourne Opera and founded the famed
Edinburgh Festival. He moved to the United States in 1949, but
retained his British nationality and was knighted for his
contributions to music.

   A former Wedtech Corp. official has admitted
that he waited months before telling prosecutors about his alleged
attempt to offer a $200,000 bribe to U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   Mario Moreno, former vice chairman of the defunt Bronx defense
contractor, says prosecutors didn't ask him about Meese and he
didn't volunteer the information.
   A prosecutor, however, objected to defense attorney Dominick
Amorosa's line of questioning Wednesday at the racketeering trial
of Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Shannon explained, with the jury
out of the room, that prosecutors in Manhattan were barred from
inquiring about Meese because he was then being investigated in
Washington under the special prosecutor law.
   Meese has not been charged with any wrongdoing, although a
special prosecutor continues to investigate his dealings with
Wedtech, a local manufacturer that won millions of dollars in
defense contracts.
   The attorney general's legal troubles have placed him under
increasing pressure to step down, triggered in part by the
resignation of some of his top aides earlier this week.
   Ms. Shannon also said the special prosecutor initially was
investigating former White House aide Lyn Nofziger, not Meese,
until last May. Nofziger was convicted last month of illegal
lobbying for Wedtech.
   Biaggi, his eldest son, Richard, and the other co-defendants are
accused of turning Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise that paid
bribes to public officials and others.
   Moreno is one of four former Wedtech officers cooperating with
the government in a bid for leniency.
   He has previously testified that he and former Wedtech President
Anthony Guariglia offered $200,000 to E. Robert Wallach, a close
friend of the attorney general, ``to fix the case'' with Meese.
   He also said that Wallach never got back to them and the money
never was paid.
   In his 12th day on the witness stand, Moreno admitted under
prodding by Amorosa, Richard Biaggi's attorney, that he did not
tell prosecutors about the bribe offer until at least August 1987,
more than eight months after he and the other ex-Wedtech officers
began cooperating with investigators.
   Wallach, former Meese financial adviser W. Franklyn Chinn, and
another man have been indicted in a separate case, charged with
allegedly taking payoffs from Wedtech to influence Meese and other
government officials.
   All three have pleaded innocent.

<HEAD>Taiwan Replacing Nuclear Plant That Concerned U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government official today confirmed that
Taiwan is replacing a research nuclear reactor. The United States
long has worried the reactor could be used in an atomic weapons
development program.
   Liu Kuang-chi, secretary-general of the government Atomic Energy
Council, said the United States was assisting in converting the
reactor to a new system that would provide ``less possibility to
produce plutonium,'' a key component in the production of atomic
weapons.
   The comments were made one week after The New York Times
reported the Reagan administration pressured Taiwan to close the
reactor and to stop work on a secret installation that could have
processed the reactor's spent fuel to extract plutonium.
   Liu had earlier confirmed that the research reactor at Lung Tan,
25 miles southwest of Taipei, was closed in January but denied the
move was made because of U.S. pressure.
   Today, however, he acknowledged that ``maybe there's some
influence (from) the United States'' behind the decision to replace
the reactor, adding that Washington ``did express its concern about
our research.''
   The energy official said the U.S. concern over Lung Tan goes
back many years and may partly be caused by reports that India
developed atomic weaponry using a reactor of the same design.
   Liu reiterated Taiwan's position of not developing atomic bombs
and said of the Lung Tan overhaul, ``Since we decided not to make
(atomic) weapons, why not make them (the United States) happy?''
   Liu said the main reason for changing Lung Tan's design was to
make it compatible with Taiwan's nuclear power reactors, which run
on a different system.
   ``It's a major change, the reactor is completely changed,'' Liu
said. ``It is a very major task ... It is keeping everybody busy.''
He said the conversion would take at least two years, but he did
not have a cost estimate.
   According to Liu, the United States is providing technical help
and will provide assistance in obtaining fuel for testing the new
core.
   The Lung Tan reactor, which opened in 1973, has used heavy water
to control the splitting of atomic nuclei, a system that can use
natural uranium as fuel. The reactor is being converted to a
``light water'' system that requires enriched uranium fuel.
   Chang Kuo-lung, professor of physics of the National Taiwan
University, said the high-tech production of enriched uranium is
limited to a few countries, making the fuel comparatively difficult
to obtain and its use easier to monitor. Liu said Taiwan cannot
make the enriched fuel.
   Liu also stressed that Taiwan doesn't have facilities to process
spent fuel into weapons-grade plutonium. When asked whether Taiwan
had worked on a secret processing installation, he replied:
``Baloney.''
   Still, local newspapers have been filled with reports that the
U.S. government learned from a missing top-level Taiwanese nuclear
researcher that Taiwan had plans to make nuclear weapons.
   The media reports claim that Col. Chang Hsien-yi, former deputy
director of the official Nuclear Energy Research Center, is working
for the CIA and has moved to the United States since disappearing
in January.
   Liu, who previously worked with Chang, said he did not know
where the missing official was or what had happened to him.
   Taiwan's nuclear policy is a particularly sensitive topic
because Communist China has said Taiwan production of atomic
weapons would be a reason for invading the island, which Beijing
views as a renengade province.

   A storm packing winds up to 40 mph swirled around the Rockies
today, spreading more than 5 inches of snow from Utah to the Great
Plains.
   Rain fell across the Tennessee and lower Mississippi valleys,
prompting flash flood watches in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana
where recent rain left the ground saturated.
   Forecasters said up to 2 feet of snow were expected in the
foothills of the Colorado Rockies by Friday morning. So far, more
than 5 inches have fallen at Fort Collins, Colo., and more than 3
inches in parts of Wyoming.
   Snow also fell this morning in parts of Utah. Forecasters said 3
to 6 inches would fall today and be blown by strong northerly winds.
   Northeast winds gusted up to 40 mph this morning at Rock
Springs, Wyo., and Akron, Colo. In California, forecasters posted
wind advisories for parts of Southern California and a gale warning
for the northern coast.
   A heavy snow warning was issued for the eastern foothills of
northern Colorado through tonight. Snow advisories also were posted
in Nebraska's southern panhandle. In addition, forecasters issued
winter storm watches for parts of Wyoming and Kansas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
southern Plains across the lower Mississippi Valley, Alabama, the
Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys and the southern Appalachians;
Rain from Oklahoma and eastern Texas into Kentucky and Tennessee;
snow from northern Arizona and the central Rockies into the central
high Plains; windy conditions from Southern California into Western
Texas.
   Highs will be in the 50s or 60s in much of the nation; below
freezing over parts of Colorado and southeast Wyoming; 30s and 40s
from the northern and central Rockies across the northern Plains
into the upper Great Lakes region; 70s and low 80s over California,
the desert Southwest and from southern and eastern Texas to the

   A casket empty except for a dress, a rose and
other remembrances was interred during a brief ceremony attended by
a dozen mourners of Denise Naslund, allegedly murdered by killer
Ted Bundy 14 years ago.
   The 20-minute memorial on Wednesday was as close as Denise's
mother, Eleanor Rose, could get to the realization of a longtime
wish that her 18-year-old daughter be buried.
   Fragments of Denise's bones were found strewn in the wooded
Cascade foothills east of Seattle in the summer of 1974. King
County authorities, who kept the remains as part of their
investigation of Bundy, lost them years ago.
   Looking on through tears, Ms. Rose watched Wednesday as a pink
casket, containing only her daughter's favorite dress, a silk rose,
a crucifix and some photographs and letters, was buried at a
cemetery on a West Seattle hillside.
   ``Oh for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice
that is still,'' the Rev. Desmond McMahon quoted poet Alfred
Tennyson during the service.
   King County police called Bundy, 41, their prime suspect in the
deaths of Ms. Naslund and 23-year-old Janice Ott, but he never was
charged in the cases. He is on death row in Florida for three
murders in that state.

<HEAD>Irish Woman Recovering from Critical Injuries in St. Pat's Day
Accident</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young Irishwoman, critically injured in a St.
Patrick's Day traffic accident while on a visit to her jailed
boyfriend, emerged from a coma after prayers for her recovery, says
a family spokesman.
   Margaret Hanley ``was conscious and a smile came to her face,''
said Gerry Archbold, director of the Irish-American Heritage Center
here.
   The 22-year-old Dublin woman's condition was upgraded from
critical to fair. ``There's hope she will recover fully, but it's
too early to say,'' Dorothy DeWitt, nursing supervisor at Weiss
Memorial Hospital, said Wednesday.
   Miss Hanley, who was hit by a car March 17, was in a coma for 10
days. Her parents, Stephen and Ann Hanley, visited her bedside
daily, praying and hoping.
   Archbold attributed Miss Hanley's improvement to prayer.
   ``We prayed hard for her,'' he said. ``There were special
prayers during the Palm Sunday Mass at the center. Just shortly
after the Mass was over, she started to regain consciousness.
   ``She recognized voices, but she has a long way to go,''
Archbold said.
   Her recovery will take a long time, said Nancy Durbin, another
nursing supervisor.
   ``The fact that she has been up and talking is a very, very good
sign,'' said Miss DeWitt.
   A ventilator that helped Miss Hanley breathe has been removed,
but she is still being fed intravenously, Mrs. Durbin said.
   She said Miss Hanley tries to talk, and mouths words. Mrs.
Durbin said she does not know if the young woman has mentioned
Daniel Stokes, a 21-year-old native of Ireland whom she met last
year when he was there for a visit.
   Stokes, who returned to Chicago last November, says the two fell
in love. He is in the Cook County Jail on a charge of bludgeoning
his landlord to death. If convicted, he could receive the death
penalty.
   In addition to first-degree murder, he is charged with
residential burglary, armed robbery, home invasion and possession
of a stolen motor vehicle.
   Miss Hanley followed Stokes to Chicago last month. The accident
occurred the day before she planned to return to Ireland.

<BYLINE>Court Fight `Moot' As 18-Year-Old Woman Ends Pregnancy

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A divorcing couple's legal battle over
their unborn child apparently ended when the 18-year-old woman
underwent an abortion before she could be served with a court order
blocking the procedure.
   Jennifer Reynolds ended her 8-week-old pregnancy over her
estranged husband's objections in less than an hour Wednesday,
between the time a district court allowed the procedure and the
Utah Court of Appeals blocked it, said Rosemary Gacnick,
spokeswoman for the state court system.
   The abortion was performed before the appellate court could
serve Mrs. Reynolds with papers reinstating a temporary restraining
order vacated about an hour earlier by 3rd District Judge David S.
Young, Gacnik said.
   The appeals court had scheduled a Monday hearing to consider
25-year-old Michael Jon Reynolds' appeal of Young's decision, but
her husband's attorney said the hearing might be pointless if the
fetus had been aborted.
   ``If the abortion has taken place, we're going to have to make
some serious evaluation ... there's a pretty good argument that
would make it moot,'' said the attorney, Mitchell Barker.
   Young issued the original restraining order last week, when he
ruled that Mrs. Reynolds could not have an abortion pending
resolution of a divorce-related custody dispute involving a
10-month-old infant and the fetus.
   He vacated his own order on Wednesday when he accepted arguments
by American Civil Liberties Union attorneys that a woman has a
constitutional right to end her pregnancy.
   Young said while Reynolds may have the right to be consulted
about any abortion involving Mrs. Reynolds, she had the ultimate
authority over whether to carry the fetus to term.
   Barker acknowledged Mrs. Reynold's right to privacy, but said
her husband also had the right of procreation and that when the two
clash, it is the courts which must decide who prevails.
   Later, while Barker filed an appeal to the appellate division,
which reinstated the restraining order pending Monday's hearing,
Mrs. Reynolds drove off to have the abortion.
   ``Nobody wins _ no matter who wins,'' Reynolds said. ``It's not
my right or her right. I think the child's got a right of its own.
It's a baby. It's got a mind. It can't talk, it can't walk, but
it's got a right to be born.''
   Mrs. Reynolds could not be located for comment Wednesday night.
But television station KUTV quoted her as saying she would not
comment on the abortion, saying ``that's too sensitive and personal
a question.''

<HEAD>Bank Securities Bill Clears Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation granting bank holding companies
broad new securities powers is heading into the House after getting
an overwhelming endorsement in the Senate.
   Senators voted 94-2 Wednesday night to approve a bill that would
permit the mingling of commercial and investment banking for the
first time since the Depression.
   The legislation substantially revises restrictions on banks in
the Glass-Steagall Act, passed in 1933 in reaction to abuses
preceding the 1929 stock market crash.
   Proponents of change argued that developments in the financial
system, particularly in the last decade, threaten the ability of
banks to compete. Securities firms, for instance, offer bank-like
services such as commercial paper and money market mutual funds.
   The Senate bill would permit bank holding companies to
underwrite and sell mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper
and municipal revenue bonds immediately after the bill is approved
by both houses of Congress and signed by President Reagan, who
favors the bill.
   Bank holding companies would be allowed to underwrite and sell
corporate bonds and mutual funds six months after enactment. A vote
by Congress would be required in 1991 before bank holding companies
could underwrite corporate stock, the most lucrative securities
activity.
   Wednesday evening's vote came after nearly six hours of debate
in which Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire,
D-Wis., warded off amendments that could have unraveled the
delicate compromise adopted on an 18-2 vote by his committee
earlier this month.
   The bill is seen as something of a swan song for Proxmire, who
retires next year after more than 30 years in the Senate. Just
before its adoption, it was named the Proxmire Financial
Modernization Act of 1988.
   Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American Bankers
Association, the biggest industry group pushing for the bill's
passage, praised it as benefiting consumers.
   ``This should accelerate the momentum for enlightened financial
reform legislation in the House,'' he said.
   However, the House Banking Committee is split into many
factions. Its chairman, Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., has
released a proposal that would grant banks only a few securities
powers _ commercial paper, mortgage revenue bonds and asset-backed
securities _ and places more restrictions on banks.
   Ogilvie said bankers would work in the House to defeat limits on
banks' insurance activities, but his industry faces tougher going
there than it did in the Senate.
   One provision of the Senate bill would require banks to prove
they are meeting the needs of poor citizens and neighborhoods
before getting permission to exercise the new powers authorized in
the bill.
   Another prohibits misleading savings account advertisements, and
another requires lenders to disclose terms of home equity loans.

<HEAD>Former Public Guardian Found Guilty Of Theft, Misconduct</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A former public guardian, convicted of
stealing as much as $200,000 from mentally handicapped or elderly
wards, may have to repay all the money, a prosecutor says.
   Multnomah County Circuit Judge Winston L. Bradshaw on Wednesday
found Paul E. Nizdil, 44, guilty of 12 counts of felony theft and
12 counts of official misconduct, a misdemeanor. Sentencing was set
for May 24.
   Nizdil, who was fired in October as the county's public guardian
and conservator, was convicted after the defense and prosecution
agreed to submit police reports as the only evidence.
   The agreement calls for Nizdil to repay the stolen money, but
the exact amount was not set, defense attorney Janet Hoffman said.
The total could be upwards of $200,000, said Deputy District
Attorney Jeffrey Martin.
   Each theft count carries a maximum sentence of five years in
prison. Each misconduct count carries a maximum penalty of a year
in jail.
   Nizdil remains free on his own recognizance pending sentencing.
   Ms. Martin said the state had not yet prepared a sentencing
recommendation, but said the state had made no sentencing
concessions in its agreement with Nizdil.
   Nizdil was indicted on 22 counts each of theft and misconduct.
Ms. Martin said there was evidence of additional thefts, but said
that evidence will not be presented to a grand jury because of the
agreement.
   Ms. Martin said an investigation into Nizdil's conduct before
his firing had not been completed. If Nizdil continues cooperating
with the investigation, the state will move for dismissal of the
remaining counts, she said.
   Ms. Hoffman said Nizdil suffers from a compulsion to gamble, and
told the judge she would call two doctors to testify on Nizdil's
behalf at his sentencing.
   Last month, Nizdil repaid the county $65,334, the amount
identified up to that point as having been stolen.
   Since then, the state's estimate of the total amount taken from
elderly or mentally handicapped wards has increased from $114,000
to $200,000.
   Nizdil admitted to police that on several occasions he made
checks payable to a fictitious name for repairs allegedly made to
houses owned by wards. Nizdil told police he used money from the
checks to pay gambling debts.
   Nizdil was fired for reasons unrelated to the thefts. County
officials did not discover the missing money until January, when
tenants renting a house owned by a ward complained that repairs had
not been made.

<DATELINE>COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old nicknamed ``Buzz'' is
winging his way across America on a 10-day flight planned as the
longest trip by a boy believed to be the nation's youngest
unlicensed pilot.
   Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano, who earlier this month
made a one-mile solo in an ultra-light plane, was at the controls
of his father's twin-engine Cessna on Wednesday as it left John
Wayne Airport.
   Tony was accompanied by his flight instructor, Ed Fernett, and
Don Taylor, an observer from the National Aeronautics Association.
Taylor will verify that Tony is at the controls throughout the
flight.
   ``The goal is to do it by myself. Even if we lose an engine, I'm
gonna do it,'' Tony said in an interview before leaving.
   Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, said his son would fly four to
seven hours a day during the 10-day trip. Tony will not fly Sunday
so he can spend Easter with relatives in Massachusetts.
   Tony wants to break the longest-trip-by-youngest-pilot record
set by 10-year-old Christopher Lee Marshall of Oceano, who flew
from San Luis Obispo County to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and back to
Burbank last August.
   On March 13, Tony set a record as the youngest pilot to fly solo
when he flew his father's ultra-light plane _ which is not
regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration _ around Oceanside
Municipal Airport.
   In order for Tony to fly a larger plane like the Cessna, Tony
must have a licensed instructor in the cockpit with him.
   His latest trip includes landings in El Paso, Texas; Dallas;
Memphis, Tenn.; Gastonia, N.C.; Richmond, Va.; Bedford, Mass.;
Washington; Evansville, Ind.; St. Louis; Oklahoma City; Tucumcari,
N.M.; and Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Woman Claims As Many As 20 Men Raped Her</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine men have been charged with raping a
woman who told authorities that her attackers urged other men
gathered at an illegal cockfight to join in.
   The 19-year-old woman said she was abducted as she walked on a
street and taken to a rural South Texas area where as many as 20
men raped her in a parked car, according to assistant district
attorney Rodolfo V. Gutierrez.
   Warrants charging nine local men with sexual assault were
issued, said Efrain Perez, chief investigator with the Duval County
Sheriff's Department. Four were arrested as of Wednesday, and more
arrests were expected, said Gutierrez. Charges of kidnapping could
be added, he said.
   Authorities said many of the approximately 30 men at the illegal
sporting event Saturday night knew the attack was going on but did
nothing to rescue the victim, a mother of two children, even though
she was crying out for help.
   ``Morally, it was not right for them to stand there,'' Gutierrez
said, noting that legally the individuals could be charged with
failure to render aid.
   ``I don't think it was planned. I think it was spontaneous,'' he
said. ``There is no way to justify this.
   The victim was taken Sunday morning to Humana Hospital at Corpus
Christi for treatment and was released earlier this week, Carrillo
said.
   ``She was afraid to tell her husband,'' Carrillo said. ``He had
been looking for her all night.'' He said her husband convinced her
to file charges on Monday.
   Ricardo ``Rocky'' Carrillo, an investigator with the Duval
County District Attorney's office, said some of the alleged rapists
``egged others on'' to sexually assault the victim.
   Authorities said the woman was able to identify some of the men
while others attempted to disguise themselves by holding their
hands over their faces.
   The four arrested were Jose Carlos ``Payo'' Briones, 29, Roel
``Roy'' Torres, 24, Adolfo Quintanilla Jr., 28, and Roberto Andres
Garcia, 21, all of San Diego.
   All four were free on bonds of $20,000 each, a spokeswoman for
Justice of the Peace Amado Garcia Jr. said.
   Sexual assault is a second-degree felony punishable by a
sentence of two to 20 years in prison.

<HEAD>No Surprise: Men Prefer Short Skirts On Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While conceding that the style is inappropriate
at times, men are far less willing than women to once again consign
the miniskirt to fashion history, according to a poll published
today.
   Some 36 percent of men say they prefer above-the-knee hemlines
for women's skirts, according to the New York Times-CBS News poll.
That compares with only a quarter of adult women who say they've
worn a skirt that short in the past year.
   In addition, 71 percent of the men surveyed say they favor
skirts at or above the knee, while 46 percent of women say they
prefer skirts below the knee.
   While men, such as Greg Parker, a 25-year-old Palm Bay, Fla.
engineer, said they found the short skirts ``attractive'' and
``sexy-looking,'' they also admit that longer lengths are often
more practical.
   ``If you're in a (business) meeting and everyone's dressed
conservatively, there's less distraction'' with longer skirts,
Parker said.
   Ted Austin, a Richmond, Va. real-estate broker and developer,
likened working women in short skirts to men in shorts and beach
shirts at the office.
   ``I don't think it's acceptable today,'' he said.
   The less-than eager reaction from women to the shorter lengths
introduced en masse for spring precipitated a recent return by
designers to some longer lengths in their fall collections.
   Among different age groups, slightly more than half of women 18
to 29 years old said they'd worn miniskirts, while 27 percent of
women 30 to 44 and only 8 percent of women 45 to 64 said they had.
   That perhaps confirms the opinion of one poll respondent,
24-year-old model Regina Lynn of Rogersville, Ala., who said she's
noticed ``older women don't look good in them.''
   Only 20 percent of married women said they had worn miniskirts
in the last year, compared with 56 percent of the
never-been-marrieds.
   One unmarried woman who did not want her name used said it would
be a lie to say she did not choose her clothes partly to please men.
   ``I don't go out of my way if I'm going to be in a meeting all
day just with women,'' she said.
   The poll of 1,654 adults was conducted by telephone between
March 19 and 22 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus
3 percent for women and 4 percent for men. The potential error for
smaller subgroups is larger.

   Two freight trains collided about two
miles east of downtown, setting locomotives on fire and forcing the
brief evacuation of an estimated 200 people, officials said.
   Crews worked through the night to right the 22 freight cars and
five locomotives derailed in the Wednesday evening wreck.
   Two firefighters and a police officer were treated for smoke
inhalation at Flagstaff Regional Medical Center and released,
officials said.
   The eastbound Santa Fe trains collided when one failed to slow
for the other at a point where parallel tracks cross, said state
Corporation Commission spokesman Jon Poston.
   A fireball erupted from one of the diesel locomotive, then the
fire spread to other engines, said police Sgt. Pasqual Macias.
   ``Some of those engines were embedded into the ground, and they
were strewn all over _ some right side up, some perpendicular to
the track,'' said Fire Department Capt. Paul Hellenberg. Some of
the locomotives went down a 20-foot embankment, Hellenberg said.
   The evacuation of homes and businesses on the east side was
called off about two hours later because shipping manifests showed
there was no hazardous material near the fire.
   One car was loaded with explosives and another contained a
flammable liquid or gas, but neither derailed, said Hellenberg.
   Two streets were closed, but they reopened after the fire was
put out.
   The accident ripped out about 100 feet of railroad track,
Hellenberg said.

Reward</HEAD>

   A drug-case witness whose house was being
guarded by a police officer who was killed will receive a $25,000
reward in addition to $126,000 for his house.
   The city agreed to buy the home of Arjune, a Guyanese immigrant
who uses only one name, after officer Edward Byrne was slain Feb.
26 while guarding it. The officer was there because the house had
been firebombed twice after Arjune complained about neighborhood
drug dealers.
   Since Byrne's killing, for which four men have been arrested,
the city had been using the house as a base for a narcotics task
force.
   The city originally offered $140,000 for the house, which was
appraised at at $126,000.
   City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin last week forced a $13,500
cut in the price, arguing that if the city wanted to give Arjune a
reward, it should not do so by inflating the price of the house.
   Goldin said Wednesday he had arranged for private donors who
wished to remain anonymous to give the witness a $25,000 reward.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Waldheim May Have Worked For U.S., British
Intelligence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kurt Waldheim may have cooperated with U.S. and
British intelligence services after World War II in return for
having his German army record purged of incriminating evidence, a
British newspaper reported today.
   A panel of historians has concluded the Austrian president was
``in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the Balkans, knew
they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them. It also
said Waldheim concealed his wartime past and tried to make it seem
harmless once he could no longer hide it.
   The international panel of historians left open the question of
whether he was guilty of any crime. Waldheim has denied any
wrongdoing.
   The Times of London said today it had unearthed evidence that
British wartime documents and subsequent British Foreign Office
papers likely to relate to Waldheim's wartime role had been
suppressed.
   The report, by correspondent Robert Fisk, said the suppression
raised suspicion Waldheim may have collaborated with the Americans
and British after the war in return for having his German army
record purged.
   Fisk quoted Robert Herzstein, a University of South Carolina
history professor, as saying he believes Waldheim passed on large
amounts of information after the war to Allied intelligence agents,
especially on communist partisans in Yugoslavia and guerrillas in
Greece.
   Herzstein is due to publish a book next week that suggests
Waldheim worked for the Americans after the war.
   Fisk quoted him as saying several records of the British element
in the United Nations War Crimes Commission appeared to be missing
from the British government's Public Records Office.
   Fisk's report said The Times had examined hundreds of wartime
files at the Public Records Office. Fisk said that in one file on
military activities in Yugoslavia between May 1944 and the end of
the war, when Waldheim was in Dubrovnik, an entire section listed
in the index as ``allegations of murder of British prisoners of
war'' was missing.
   The reporter said a government order had closed a file on the
slayings to public access until the year 2021.
   He quoted officials at the Public Records Office as saying they
did not know when the order was issued. But he said the government
decision to prevent public access was taken before 1982, when
Waldheim ended his 10-year term as U.N. secretary-general.
   Allegations about Waldheim's alleged links to wartime atrocities
surfaced in 1986 during his campaign for the Austrian presidency.
   Fisk said attempts by The Times to seek access to specific
``closed'' files and to obtain reasons for their retention were
refused.

<TEXT>
   Two portable anti-aircraft missiles,
tentatively identified as Soviet-made SAM-7s, were found aboard an
Iranian gunboat recovered by the U.S. Navy last week, a Navy
spokesman said today.
   The weapons on the boat, found abandoned and drifting in the
Strait of Hormuz, also included three ``chaff rockets'' of unknown
origin and four other unidentified rockets with fusing devices.
   Chaff is a material blown into the air to confuse the homing
system of a radar-guided missile.
   Maj. Barry Willey, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command,
said the twin-barrelled gun mounted in the cockpit of the 30-foot
boat was a Soviet-made ZSU 23mm anti-aircraft weapon.
   The gun apparently had been used for attacks on ships in the
southern Persian Gulf and the Hormuz. It was rusty, but functional,
and was loaded for firing when found.
   Authoritative references say the Soviet SAM-7, a shoulder-fired
missile similar to the American-made Redeye, is known to be a part
of Iran's weapons inventory. But Willey said he did not know
whether it had previously been seen in the gulf.
   Iran also is believed to possess some U.S.-made Stinger
missiles, a more advanced missile than the Redeye. It fired at
least one at a U.S. helicopter last October, but missed.
   Several Stingers and a spent launcher were found in a sunken
Iranian speedboat recovered by U.S. Navy divers on Jan. 3.
   The gunboat, an open-cockpit, twin-diesel craft, was found by
the guided missile frigate Reuben James, drifting in 10-foot seas
in the Hormuz passage last Thursday.
   The boat's whereabouts were not disclosed. Willey would say only
that it was in U.S. Navy custody.
   U.S. officers have said they do not know why the boat apparently
was abandoned by the Iranians. It appeared to have been recently
vacated by its crew and was trailing a sea anchor.
   The fiberglass-hulled boat was the fourth Iranian small craft
captured by the Navy in the Persian Gulf in the past six months,
but the first taken in the southern waterway where Iran's naval
frigates and Revolutionary Guards concentrate their surface raids
on neutral shipping.
   In addition to the rockets and missiles, Willey said the boat
yielded one Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifle and 203 rounds of
ammunition, 500 rounds of ammunition for the mounted gun, and
related items.
   The missiles apparently were contained in a sealed wooden box,
six feet long, found in the bottom of the boat.
   Officers on the Reuben James did not open the box, but there was
speculation at the time that it might contain Stingers or other
portable rockets.
   The SAM-7, known as the ``Strela,'' or arrow in Russian, has an
effective range of about two miles, atttacking aircraft by homing
in on their engine exhaust.
   Although it has been replaced in the Soviet inventory by a newer
portable missile, the SAM-14, the Strela is still being produced
for Soviet forces and for export sales.
   It also is manufactured by China and Egypt, and more than 40
countries, including both Iran and Iraq, are believed to have the
weapon in their arsenals.
   U.S. officials gave no further information on the chaff rockets
found on the Iranian boat. Such rockets are carried aboard most
warships and aircraft in the gulf.

   The ``Mole Patrol'' is on a roll.
   For nine years, Officer Charles Myers worked underground,
patrolling the 3{-mile network of corridors, platforms and tunnels
of Philadelphia's mass-transit system. His unit was justly dubbed
the Mole Patrol.
   He now helps run the Police Department's two battery-powered
carts, which cruise silently through the concourse at the hub of
the city's transportation system.
   The white and blue industrial carts, fitted with searchlights,
rescue gear, two-way radio, roll bar and dome lights, can carry
8,400 pounds and have a top speed of about 10 mph. They cost $6,200
apiece.
   The new carts were quickly dubbed ``mole mobiles.'' After all,
``transit response vehicles'' just sounds too stuffy.
   Before the carts came, if Myers heard of trouble in another part
of the concourse, ``it would be a footrace,'' he said. ``You'd be
exhausted by the time you got there.''
   ``We see a very positive response by all the store owners,''
Capt. Lawrence Norton, commander of the transit unit, said
Wednesday.
   ``They see this cart, they come out and want to say hello. The
public stops you all the time,'' he said. ``They get a real kick
out of the fact that the police are down here in strength.''
   Within the next year the department hopes to add five more of
the vehicles, because a cart is cheaper than paying for extra
officers, Norton said.
   The vehicles are parked and recharged during morning and evening
rush hours, when the transit system's 350,000 daily passengers clog
the passageways.
   Myers said he and another officer arrested a burglar their first
night, when they received a suspicious-person report and sped off
to a far-off part of the concourse, which features stores,
restaurants and banks.
   ``Lo and behold, there's a man standing there inside a closed
store,'' Myers said. ``The only thing he said was, `I didn't hear
you coming.'''

   Sir William McMahon, a former prime
minister, died today after a long battle with cancer. He was 80.
   McMahon died early today at St. Luke's Hospital in Sydney and
was cremated in a private service shortly afterward, family members
said.
   McMahon served as prime minister and head of the Liberal Party
in 1971-72, and previously headed the Treasury and Foreign Affairs
Department.
   He became prime minister on March 10, 1971, after John Gorton
was ousted as prime minister and Liberal Party leader in a dispute
within the party. But McMahon lost to Gough Whitlam the following
year. McMahon entered Parliament in 1949.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of the Labor Party praised McMahon's
service.
   ``Although on opposite sides of the political fence, I found Sir
William a generous opponent. He maintained an enormous enthusiasm
for and interest in public affairs after his retirement from
Parliament and was constructive in his discussions on economics and
political matters,'' Hawke said in a statement.
   Liberal Party leader John Howard said: ``Few parliamentarians in
the postwar period could boast a career as rich and diverse as Sir
William's.''
   Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser called McMahon a
vigorous administrator and tenacious member of Parliament who would
be remembered for three decades of dedicated service.
   McMahon is survived by his wife, Lady Sonia, his son, Julian,
and two daughters, Belinda and Deborah.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Woman To Wear Sign Declaring Herself Sex Offender</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>

   A former preschool worker has been ordered to
wear a sign around her neck about her sex offenses after she
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of sexually assaulting two
girls.
   King County Superior Court Judge Warren Chan on Wednesday gave
Julia Lynn Guptill-Gilbert of Bothell a choice between spending 30
days in jail or wearing the sign for 60 days every time she goes
out in public.
   Ms. Guptill-Gilbert chose to wear the sign. She taught at a
Montessori school at the time of the assaults on two girls, aged 4
and 5.
   Chan left it up to county prosecutors to decide the size and
exact wording of the sign to be worn by the 19-year-old woman, who
is five months pregnant.
   ``My words to her were that she must wear a sign saying: `I've
been convicted of communicating with a minor for immoral
purposes,''' Chan said.
   Chan also ordered Ms. Guptill-Gilbert to write letters of
apology to both victims, who were in court.
   Both prosecution and defense attorneys objected to the ruling.
   ``Our office has a preference for punishment that includes
confinement, supervision and treatment, and we prefer those methods
over the ones used by the judge in this case,'' said Dan Donohoe,
the King County prosecutor's administrative assistant.
   ``You get to the matter of whether the punishment is cruel and
unusual,'' he said. ``I'm not a lawyer, but I do think it's
unusual.''
   Prosecutors had recommended a suspended one-year jail term for
Ms. Guptill-Gilbert, plus payment of counseling costs for the
children and a mental health evaluation for Ms. Guptill-Gilbert.
   Defense attorney Michael Frost said Ms. Guptill-Gilbert is
likely to stay in her residence the entire 60-day period to avoid
wearing the sign in public.
   Ms. Guptill-Gilbert already has moved to California, raising
questions about how sign order will be enforced.
   Chan has scheduled a court hearing May 4 to find out whether
California authorities will assume responsibility for monitoring
the punishment. The 60-day period for wearing the sign isn't to
begin until then.
   ``If she feels that wearing a sign is too much of a burden for
her out in the public, all she has to do is stay home, which serves
the same purpose as keeping her in the jail,'' Chan said.

<HEAD>Iraqi Missiles Hit Iran; Iranian Gunboats Attack Tanker In Gulf</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with three missiles fired at Iran

<TEXT>
   Iraq said today it would stop missile
attacks on Iranian cities for three days beginning at midnight,
then said it fired three missiles into Iran 10 hours before the
truce was to begin.
   In another development, an Iranian warship today attacked and
set ablaze a Cypriot supertanker in the southern Persian Gulf. The
tanker's crew of 45 was rescued by salvage tugboats after the
tanker ran aground.
   Also today, the U.S. Navy said two anti-aircraft missiles that
may be Soviet-made SAM-7s were found aboard an Iranian gunboat the
Navy discovered abandoned and drifting at the southern end of the
gulf.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said one
of the three Iraqi long-range missiles fired at Iran hit Qom, seat
of Iran's religious hierarchy, and two hit Isfahan, capital of the
ancient Persian empire.
   It said the missiles were fired about 2 p.m. local time, 10
hours before the proposed cease-fire was to begin.
   Iran had no immediate reaction to the missile attacks on
Isfahan, in western Iran, and Qom, 100 miles south of Tehran.
   But an Iranian Embassy official in Ankara, Turkey, was quoted as
saying today that Iran will comply with the proposed cease-fire if
Iraq does.
   ``Iranian attacks will automatically come to an end if Iraq
stops the war of the cities,'' embassy spokesman Riza Bagri was
quoted as saying by the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
   Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the missile duel
during which Iraq fired 105 missiles into Tehran, 13 into Qom and
10 into Isfahan since Feb. 29. Iran says it fired 45 missiles into
Baghdad, a city of 5 million people, and dozens into the northern
city of Mosul and other cities in Iraq.
   The Iraqi News Agency today quoted an unidentified government
spokesman as saying the cease-fire was ``a gesture of courtesy'' to
Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, who was scheduled to begin a
48-hour visit to Iraq on Friday.
   Ozal was on an official visit to Tehran on Feb. 29, and one of
the first Iraqi missiles fired into Tehran crashed near a downtown
hotel where members of the Turkish delegation were staying. None of
the Turkish officials was hurt.
   In the Persian Gulf, an Iranian warship attacked the 232,164-ton
Haven tanker near the Strait of Hormuz at the southern end of the
gulf sand set its load of Saudi crude oil on fire, gulf-based
shipping executives said.
   The ship drifted for more than three hours after the dawn attack
and eventually ran aground off the United Arab Emirates, said the
executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The crew was
rescued by salvage tugboats.
   At least eight tugs fought the fire on the grounded tanker for
three hours before the blaze was controlled, the executives said.
Oil was gushing out of two blasted cargo holds, burning on the
waters around the tanker.
   They said the Iranian warship launched three separate attacks on
the Haven over the course of an hour. The London-based Lloyd's
Shipping Intelligence Unit said the Iranian ship was a frigate and
the tanker was bound for Indonesia.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman today said two portable anti-aircraft
missiles, tentatively identified as Soviet-made SAM-7s, were aboard
an Iranian gunboat the Navy found abandoned and drifting in the
Strait of Hormuz last week.
   Maj. Barry Willey, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command,
said the twin-barrelled gun mounted in the cockpit of the 30-foot
boat was a Soviet-made ZSU 23mm anti-aircraft weapon.
   The gun, rusty but functional and loaded for firing when found,
apparently had been used for attacks on ships in the southern gulf
and Hormuz. The gun apparently was used for attacks on ships in the
southern gulf and the Hormuz.
   Authoritative references say the Soviet SAM-7, a shoulder-fired
missile similar to the U.S.-made Redeye, is known to be a part of
Iran's arms arsenal. But Willey said he did not know whether it was
previously seen in the gulf.

   A Stradivarius violin fetched a world record
auction price for a musical instrument of $889,240 at a Sotheby's
sale today, the auctioneers said.
   The violin, made in 1709 by Italian craftsman Antonio
Stradivari, is named after the master English violinist Marie Hall.
Composer Vaughan Williams composed ``The Lark Ascending'' for Hall,
which she first performed in 1920.
   An unidentified private South American buyer beat out two other
dealers bidding by telephone in a tense, two-minute auction.
   ``It was quite drawn out and tense and there was a round of
applause at the end,'' said Sotheby's spokeswoman Beth McHattie.
   The Marie Hall had been expected to sell for around $846,000,
and bidding started at $376,000, Sotheby's said.
   The previous highest auction price for a Stradivarius was
$728,000 for The Colossus, dated 1716, which was sold at Christie's
auction house in London last April.
   The Guinness Book of Records says the highest known price for a
Stradivarius was $1.2 million. But that was in a private sale of
Stradivarius' Alard violin by W. E. Hill and Sons to a Singaporean
on an unknown date.
   About 700 of 1,116 violins by Stradivarius have survived.
   Marie Hall, considered one of the finest violinists of her era,
died at age 72 in 1956.
   She acquired the violin in 1905 and it was passed on to her
daughter when she died. When it was last auctioned by Sotheby's in
November 1968, the violin sold for a then world record price of
$52,600.
   The violin was included in a day-long sale of violins, violas
and other stringed instruments.

   Medical malpractice attorney Harvey Wachsman
momentarily weighed the possibility of a lawsuit against the doctor
who delivered his son in the back seat of his car on Grand Central
Parkway in Queens.
   ``Maybe I should sue, just for practice,'' he said on Wednesday.
   But he immediately decided against it because the defendant
would have been, well, himself.
   Derek Wachsman weighed in at 6 pounds, 9 ounces at about 1 a.m.
Wednesday in the back seat of a Mercedes 560 SEL about 200 yards
west of La Guardia Airport.
   The elder Wachsman and his wife Kathy, also a malpractice
lawyer, left their home on Long Island about 12:15 a.m., heading
full-tilt for Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.
   But the baby wanted out well short of the hospital so Wachsman,
who was a neurosurgeon before he became a lawyer, pulled over,
delivered the baby and tied the umbilical cord with a shoelace.
   And what will Derek be when he grows up?
   ``A doctor and a lawyer,'' Wachsman said.

<TEXT>
   Ulysses S. Grant was in the White House and
Gen. George Custer was one year away from making his last stand
when Orpha Nusbaum was born Aug. 13, 1875.
   Mrs. Nusbaum, believed by the Guinness Book of World Records to
be the world's oldest person, died Wednesday at age 112.
   She had pneumonia recently, but an official cause of death was
not released, said Diane Hostetler, director of nursing at
Fountainview Nursing Home, where Mrs. Nusbaum lived.
   ``Her condition worsened during the weekend,'' Miss Hostetler
said.
   ``She couldn't do anything for herself anymore,'' said a
stepdaughter-in-law, Betty Nusbaum. ``You can't do anything for a
person who doesn't want to live anymore.''
   Betty Nusbaum said she was saddened by the death, but said Mrs.
Nusbaum had lived a good life.
   Last month, Guinness officials said they believed she was the
oldest person alive.
   Mrs. Nusbaum was honored at a special ceremony in January when
officials put the Goshen city seal on census documents indicating
she was born in 1875 on the family farm near Middlebury about 10
miles away. She spent most of her life in Middlebury until moving
to the nursing home in 1982.
   Florence Knapp, who lived in a Philadelphia suburb, had been
recognized as the world's oldest person until her death Jan. 11.
She was 114 years and 94 days old.
   Guinness restricts recognition to those who can provide birth
records and other documentation.
   There had been some confusion whether Mrs. Nusbaum would be 112
or 113 last Aug. 13. For years she had maintained she was a year
older than she actually was.
   But a document found in the public library in this northern
Indiana city last September showed that the former Orpha Ulery was
4 years old when she was counted in the U.S. Census of 1880, making
her 112.
   Mrs. Nusbaum attributed her longevity to her strict obedience to
a biblical command, Betty Nusbaum said. ``She honored her father
and mother. That's it,'' she said.
   For many years Mrs. Nusbaum taught Sunday school in the Elkhart
and Goshen areas. When she was 93, she resumed writing poetry, a
hobby she had stopped in the 1920s.
   Mrs. Nusbaum married John Mischler, a minister, in 1897. After
his death, she married Frank Nusbaum in 1947. He died in 1959.

<HEAD>Heart Disease Early Indicator Of Some AIDS Cases, Researchers Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardiologists should be aware that heart disease
can be an early indicator of AIDS, and some patients can live
longer with proper cardiac care, according to research presented at
the American College of Cardiology convention.
   In a 1983-86 study of 86 AIDS patients in Paris and Miami, 18
had heart disease and seven of those had heart disease before other
AIDS-related ailments, Dr. Evlin Kinney of the University of Miami
School of Medicine said Wednesday at the ACC meeting.
   ``Heart disease was present in 5 percent of all AIDS patients _
that's our estimate based on the patients we have seen,'' she said.
``Cardiologists need to be aware of AIDS heart disease.''
   While little could be done for AIDS patients suffering from
tumor-based heart disease, she said, cardiac disease stemming from
opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis _ rather than from
tumors _ can be treated, prolonging the lives of terminally ill
patients.
   ``There were patients who, with treatment, survived as long as
(AIDS) patients without heart disease,'' Kinney said. ``Some of
these patients, we did manage to prolong their lives for many
months.''
   AIDS cripples the body's ability to fight off disease, allowing
a variety of ailments _ including heart disease _ to cause death.
   Fourteen of the 18 AIDS heart patients were dead within four
months of diagnosis, but the other four _ all with
infection-related heart disease _ lived for about two years, she
said.
   Another participant in the study, Dr. Jean-Jacques Monsuez of
Hopital St. Louis in Paris, said early, specific diagnosis of the
ailments plaguing AIDS patients can help physicians prolong life.
Tuberculosis, for instance, is a frequent ailment in AIDS patients,
and it can be treated.
   ``If we can treat each organ involved, it's a very important
thing,'' Monsuez said.
   Kinney noted that there were only eight women among the 86 AIDS
patients studied, but half of them were suffering from AIDS-related
heart disease. While noting that the number of female patients was
small, she said, ``Females seem to be more susceptible to AIDS
heart disease ... the women were represented disproportionately.''

   Vandals went on a window-smashing spree at
the Wisconsin Capitol early today, knocking out windows in all four
wings of the building, including the governor's conference room,
security officers said.
   Michael Metcalf, chief of Capitol security, said one man was
apprehended but a second man got away.
   Officer Luke Schneider, who made the arrest, said the man
offered no resistance.
   Metcalf said two men apparently scaled the walls to second-story
balconies and began smashing the windows and high intensity lights
about 1 a.m.
   Thirty-two windows were broken, Metcalf said. It was not known
immediately how many lights were damaged.
   Metcalf estimated it would take between $10,000 aand $20,000 to
repair the damage.

   A U.S. Air Force jet fighter plunged
into the center of this small town today, killing the pilot and at
least one resident, setting homes on fire and forcing the
evacuation of about 60 people.
   The plane was carrying a canister of hydrazine, which forms
toxic gas when mixed with water, but local officials said there was
no evidence of a gas leak.
   Witnesses said the F-16 smashed into the roof of one home, tore
of the porch off another and started a ball of fire that sent
residents fleeing.
   ``There was a crash and then a loud explosion and buildings
caught fire,'' said Herbert Loef, a baker who lives three houses
away from the street from the crash site. The plane was demolished.
   Regional governor Berhard Ditteney said the body of a
60-year-old man was pulled from the rubble and rescue workers were
looking for other victims. At least one resident was injured.
   It was the second crash of a military aircraft in West Germany
in as many days. On Wednesday, a French Mirage jet fighter narrowly
missed a nuclear power plant in Bavaria, about 185 miles east of
today's crash site, before crashing and burning. The pilot was
killed.
   Today's crash occurred at 10 a.m. (3 a.m. EST) in the middle of
Forst, a town of 6,000 residents 60 miles south of Frankfurt,
police said. The pilot, whose identity was not immediately
released, was the only person aboard, the Air Force said.
   Wreckage was scattered over a wide area and thick black smoke
billowed from the crash site, witnesses said. Three homes were
destroyed and two were extensively damaged, including that of an
80-year-old woman who managed to escape unharmed when the plane hit
her house, officials said.
   Emergency crews evacuated more than 60 people from about 40
houses in the area, according to local police.
   A spokesman at the U.S. Air Force Base at Ramstein, Doug Moore,
said the jet had been declared missing after taking off from Hahn
Air Force Base in the Eifel Mountains.
   Lt. Col. Edward Neunherz, another base spokesman, told The
Associated Press by telephone that the F-16 was on a training
mission, but he had no further details.
   He confirmed the plane was carrying hydrazine, which is used to
refire jet engines in case of engine failure. But Neunherz added,
``That gas disperses easily in the event of an accident.''
   Norbert Scharer, spokesman for police in nearby Karlsruhe, said
there was no evidence to indicate any toxic gas was released.
   Scharer said he was told by American authorities that the plane
was carrying 500 rounds of practice ammunition but no live
ammunition.
   The F-16 was part of the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing, Neunherz
said.
   Wednesday's crash in the Bavarian village of Ohu unleashed a
wave of concern about military jets flying near nuclear power
plants. Environmentalists maintain the country had escaped disaster
by a ``split second'' when the jet crashed about one mile from the
Isar nuclear plant.
   But officials said there was no danger of an atomic accident
because of a concrete dome over the plant, which they said was
designed to withstand the force of a jet crash.

   Benjamin Netanyahu today said he resigned as
Israel's United Nations ambassador so he could speak out against
Secretary of State George P. Shultz's meeting with two
Arab-Americans linked to the PLO.
   ``The meeting raises a larger question of the value of American
commitments to us when we have made huge concessions to obtain
these guarantees,'' Netanyahu told The Associated Press, referring
to a 1975 American pledge not to meet with PLO members.
   ``As long as I was wearing an ambassador's suit, I couldn't
speak out openly,'' he told NBC ``Today'' from Tel Aviv. He said
the meeting could ``jeopardize Israel's very existence.''
   Netanyahu said he had been planning to resign in a few weeks,
but decided to speed it up after the Shultz meeting.
   His resignation was to take effect immediately. Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres has suggested Asher Ben-Natan, a former ambassador to
France and Germany, as a possible replacement.
   Netanyahu's resignation was the strongest message yet from
Israel regarding its displeasure over Shultz's meeting five days
ago with two members of the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
self-declared legislative body.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, sharpened his
opposition to the session with Edward Said and Ibrahim Abu Lughod,
both American citizens.
   He told members of his right-wing Likud bloc the meeting was ``a
slap in the face'' and said: ``The two men were representatives of
the PLO. It was possible to see on television how much they hate
Israel,'' the daily Yediot Ahronot reported today.
   Netanyahu, 39, who gained prominence as an articulate defender
of Israel's policies during his four years as U.N. ambassador, made
a surprise announcement of his resignation on Israel Television
Wednesday night.
   He said he was planning to resign ``in a matter of weeks''
anyway to allow him to begin campaigning for a seat as a Likud
legislator in November's elections.
   While stressing that he still had ``warm personal regard'' for
Shultz, Netanyahu said the secretary's meeting with Said and Abu
Lughod, both American citizens, had created ``a deep rift'' between
the United States and Israel.
   ``Even friends can sometimes take steps which are unacceptable
or dangerous,'' he said.
   Because of Shultz's meeting, Netanyahu said, ``It appears the
Palestine Liberation Organization will be introduced into the
proposed international conference through the back door.''
   ``The very clear possibility exists now that the PLO will sit
across the table from Israel in this conference and will be the
party we will be demanded to give land to,'' he said.
   ``Then the conference could result in a PLO state right in the
heart of Israel, threatening our very security, our very future.''
   Netanyahu said he would publicly oppose the American peace
initiative, particularily the portion which calls for an
international conference including the parties to the conflict and
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the
United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
   ``I will pound the pavement from city to city in order to
explain to the public the dangers of an international conference,''
he said.

   A lawyer for surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould says Baby M will be better equipped to deal with
her future if she continues to grow up knowing her natural mother.
   ``The best interest of this child is plainly to continue the
present relationship. It's a good relationship. Let's make it
better. Let's go to work,'' attorney Joel Siegal said Wednesday in
closing arguments in the Baby M visitation hearing.
   But an attorney for the child's father, William Stern, and his
wife Elizabeth, said the 2-year-old girl has an excellent
relationship with the Tenafly couple that should not be disrupted
by visitation for at least five years.
   ``She doesn't need two mothers when a functional mother and
father are everything this child needs,'' Frank Donahue said in his
summation.
   The 1{ hours of closing arguments brought to an end a long and
bitter courtroom fight for the child, now legally known as Melissa
Stern. The decision on visitation now rests with Superior Court
Judge Birger W. Sween, whose ruling is not expected before next
week.
   The dispute began after the child was born on March 27, 1986,
and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould reneged on a surrogacy contract with the
Sterns. It climaxed with an unprecedented Feb. 3 New Jersey Supreme
Court decision that outlawed surrogacy for pay.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 30, who currently sees her daughter during
two-hour, supervised visits once a week, said she wants
``meaningful'' and gradually expanded visitation.
   The Sterns have custody and want to delay Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's
visitation rights.
   Siegal warned the judge Wednesday that to reject immediate
visitation would go against the intent of the New Jersey Supreme
Court ruling and ``by indirection we are enforcing the surrogacy
contract.''
   Siegal said Wednesday that gradually expanded visitation by Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould is in Melissa's best interest.
   ``She will be better equipped to go forward and deal with
life,'' he said.
   Siegal said both sides should undergo counseling to heal wounds
and ensure a smooth visitation schedule.
   But Donahue rejected counseling.
   ``It's pie in the sky,'' Donahue said. ``It just doesn't happen
in our experience.''
   Donahue also said that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould may try to exploit
the child. He cited Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's decision to sell
pictures of her wedding with Wall Street accountant Dean Gould for
$20,000 to the Star magazine, a supermarket tabloid.
   ``One wonders what price a picture of Melissa would bring,''
Donahue said.

   You can carry your skis on the Mount
Washington Cog Railway, but you better not try to use them to ski
down the famous _ and treacherous _ Tuckerman Ravine.
   ``We don't plan to let the people who ride the train ski down
Tuckerman Ravine,'' said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Ned
Therrien. ``We will take some action to prevent people from
trespassing under federal regulations.''
   The railway last year proposed running a spring ski train to the
top of New England's highest peak for the Tuckerman ski season,
normally April and May. The Forest Service denied the necessary
permits.
   Railway Vice President Wayne Presby said the railway hasn't
advertised for skiers this year, but officials don't intend to try
to keep them off the rails.
   ``As a public utility, I can't discriminate against hikers,
sightseers or skiers,'' he said.
   The Forest Service said it feared letting skiers ride the train
up the mountain would increase the number of inexperienced skiers
trying to make the dangerous run down the ravine and its famed
headwall.
   Skiers who make the run have to hike nearly three miles to the
top of the mountain with their skis strapped to their backs.
   The Forest Service says forcing skiers to hike up the mountain
limits those who attempt the hairy descent to only the heartiest
and most experienced.
   Presby said the railway will begin operating this year on April
16.
   Meantime, Forest Service officials met Wednesday with Albert
Risch, who carries skiers to the headwall via chartered helicopter,
and urged him to stop the flights. The helicopter uses private
land, so the agency cannot order it to stop.
   Risch said he has not decided whether he'll bow to the agency's
wishes.

   Lebanese soldiers killed two Syrian
soldiers in a battle in a Christian enclave early today, the first
clash between the forces in more than two years, military sources
said.
   The Lebanese opened fire on a Syrian patrol that entered the
eastern edge of the Christians' 300-square-mile enclave in
northeast Lebanon before dawn, one source said.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two
sides clashed for about 30 minutes with automatic weapons and
grenades near the village of Zighrine. No Lebanese casualties were
reported.
   Zighrine, a Christian village, lies 15 miles northeast of Beirut.
   The source said the Syrian patrol ``withdrew from the Zighrine
area after the clash.'' He did not elaborate.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 25,000 troops
in eastern and northern provinces under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Syria also has 7,500 troops in Moslem west Beirut seeking to
restore law and order after years of militia anarchy.
   The Lebanese army fought a series of battles with the Syrians in
the northeastern mountains in January 1986 after Christian
President Amin Gemayel torpedoed a Syrian-brokered accord to end
Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.

   City officials rearranged two crosses made from
lillies at Easter flower shows after the American Civil Liberties
Union objected that the displays promoted religion on public
property.
   The two flower crosses had been part of the annual Spring and
Easter Flower Show at the Garfield Park Conservatory and the
Lincoln Park Conservatory, Nancy Kaszak, general attorney for the
Chicago Park District, said Wednesday.
   Ms. Kaszak said she was contacted Tuesday by an ACLU attorney
who csaid the crosses amounted to a display of religious symbols at
the conservatories, which are public property.
   Park workers converted the crosses at both conservatories into
pillars of flowers climbing almost to the ceiling, she said.
   ``My concern is that the cross put up by a public body on public
property was a violation of the First Amendment,'' said Jane
Whicher, staff counsel for the ACLU in Illinois. ``It shouldn't
have been erected in the first place, but I commend the park
district on removing it so quickly.''

   Cuba's official news agency reported that a
brother and sister were sentenced to eight-year prison terms in
Cuba after admitting that they spied for the CIA.
   The Prensa Latina dispatch from Havana, received here late
Wednesday, identified the two as Nestor Norberto Garcia Hernandez
and Gladys Juana Garcia Hernandez and said they had ``proven ties''
to the CIA.
   Prensa Latina said the two ``admitted during the trial their
activity in Cuba for that American center of espionage.''
   It said the maximum sentence for the charges was 10 years
imprisonment, and the Havana judge trying the case reduced it to
eight because the two confessed.
   Cuban television had reported in May 1987 that Ms. Garcia
Hernandez, said to be a Cuban resident of the United States,
recruited and trained her brother to work as a CIA agent.
   According to Prensa Latina's account of the televised charges,
Garcia Hernandez, believed to be a Cuban citizen, sent radio
messages from May 1985 to April 1987 to the CIA at its headquarters
in Langley, Va.
   The Cuban news agency also said that during the trial it was
proven that the two ``gathered economic, political and military
information for the CIA.''

   An abandoned fishing boat stacked with 3,765 pounds
of cocaine was seized within sight of Miami's skyline in the second
largest cocaine haul ever made by the U.S. Coast Guard, officials
said.
   ``It was in bales spread out on the deck,'' said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Joe Dye on Wednesday.
   The seizure ranked second to a two-ton shipment found on a
fishing boat off Puerto Rico last fall. The cocaine was in an
unregistered, twin-engine, 26-foot open fishing boat. There were no
belongings aboard.
   ``A passing boater called us and basically said, `Hey, there's a
boat out here and it's loaded,''' Dye said.
   At first, authorities thought it was loaded with marijuana,
which is normally found in bales of 50 to 100 pounds, Dye said.
   ``Originally they thought it was pot because it was packed in
Marlboro (cigarette) cartons,'' Dye said. ``They packed the cartons
with the kilos (of cocaine) and put the cartons into cases, which
were also marked `Marlboro.'''
   The wholesale value of the cocaine was estimated at about $26
million and its value on the streets could be as high as $169
million, said a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration
Task Force in Miami.

<HEAD>Pakistan Says Ready to Sign Accord; Soviet Says No Surprise if
Talks Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan said today it is ready to sign a
settlement to end the Afghanistan conflict and expects progress
soon on deciding when outside military aid to the Soviet-backed
government and guerrillas will end.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in an
interview released today it was possible the Afghanistan peace
talks would fail, but he said that would not necessarily stop the
Soviets from withdrawing their troops.
   The New York Times said Wednesday that U.S. officials received
indications the Soviet Union will consider allowing American aid to
the rebels to continue after the 115,000 Red Army troops begin
leaving Afghanistan.
   U.S. and Pakistani officials have said the issue of continued
aid to the Afghan government and the rebels fighting it is the last
obstacle in the way of an accord to end the war.
   Zain Noorani, Pakistan's acting Foreign Minister, said his
country will sign ``any time during the day or after the Easter
break, when the other three parties are ready to sign.''
   Noorani spoke after his side and an Afghan government delegation
resumed the U.N.-mediated talks. Pakistan represents the rebels,
and the other parties are the Soviet Union and the United States.
   ``From our point of view, all the ... instruments (of the peace
package) are complete,'' he said. ``We are hopeful that in the next
few days there ought to be some kind of progress'' on the aid
issue, he added.
   Washington has said it will not guarantee a settlement unless
the Soviet Union agrees to stop funding the Kabul government at the
same time the United States stops aid to the rebels.
   Shevardnadze's interview with the Bulgarian newspaper
Rabotnichesko Delo was carried by the Soviet news agency Tass.
Shevardnadze was in Bulgaria earlier this week for a Warsaw Pact
meeting.
   ``Not everything depends solely on us and the Afghan
government,'' Shevardnadze said, referring to the outcome of the
talks. ``This is why one cannot but take into account the
possibility that the talks may not lead to the accords expected of
them.''
   Shevardnadze said that if the Geneva talks fail, the Soviet
Union will withdraw its soldiers ``in a way convenient for the
government of Afghanistan and ourselves.'' He gave no indication
whether the Soviet Union would stick to the nine-month timetable
for withdrawal already agreed to in Geneva.
   He said an agreement could be implemented without U.S.
participation if Pakistan was willing to sign a document spelling
out the details of the Soviet withdrawal.
   ``It would certainly be better if it (the United States) becomes
a guarantor. But it is quite possible, in our opinion, to conclude
the Geneva process without the U.S. guarantees,'' he said.
   Zoorani rejected this, saying everything would have to be
renegotiated if one of the superpowers refuses its guarantor role.
   The Times, citing unidentified senior U.S. officials, said the
United States was considering an arrangement under which Pakistan
would sign the accord, but the United States and the Soviet Union
would have a separate understanding on aid to the insurgents.
   The new position was discussed by telephone Wednesday by
President Reagan and Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the
newspaper said.

   Communist Party officials of a southern city
paralyzed by a strike again appealed to Soviet leaders to resolve a
dispute between two Soviet ethnic groups but condemned the tactics
of protesters, a newspaper reported today.
   The appeal, adopted at a meeting Wednesday, did not persuade
people to return to work, according to one resident who said the
strike continued today in Stepanakert, the main city of the
disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The majority of people living in the region are Armenian, but it
is part of the republic of Azerbaijan. Armenians are demanding that
it be made part of neighboring Armenia.
   ``People aren't even thinking of going to work,'' said the
resident, a man answering the telephone at the Sovietsky Karabakh
newspaper. He refused to give his name or position.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said the meeting of the
Stepanakert City Committee was stormy and that one speaker, an
engineer, cried.
   ``The majority of the Communists decisively condemned the tactic
of `forced pressure' on the country's leadership, and along with
that every speaker underlined that the Nagorno-Karabakh problem has
not been removed, that it still needs a settlement,'' Izvestia said
in a report from Stepanakert.
   The City Committee passed a resolution containing the appeal to
national leaders, Izvestia said. It provided no other details.
   Wednesday's Soviet press reports said workers vowed to continue
the walkout until the government and party reversed their decisions
to leave Nagorno-Karabakh under the control of Azerbaijan.
   The city committee had asked national leaders to reconsider the
annexation demand in February after the Communist Party Central
Committee said Nagorno-Karabakh belongs to Azerbaijan. The
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, approved
a package of cultural and economic improvements for the region on
March 23 but did not address the territorial issue.
   Street demonstrations and strikes in Nagorno-Karabakh and
Armenia's capital, Yerevan, have tested Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness. At least 32 people
were killed in ethnic violence in Sumgait in Azerbaijan last month.
   All but essential services such as bread and milk factories and
some public transportation and medical clinics have been closed in
Stepanakert since the strike began March 24.
   The man at the Sovietsky Karabakh newspaper said there were no
demonstrations in Stepanakert and that police were keeping a low
profile.
   Yerevan police last week arrested several Armenian nationalists
who had been advocating the annexation.
   Today, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
provided the first official confirmation that Paruyr Ayrikyan, a
former political prisoner, was among those arrested.
   The spokesman, at a regular news briefing, said he did not know
under which criminal statute Ayrikyan was being held. Dissidents
have said authorities charged Ayrikyan with violating a law against
defamation of the Soviet state.
   The Soviet government has forbidden foreign journalists from
traveling to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has vacated the sentence of a
convicted arms broker because the U.S. government withheld
information about its arms sales to Iran when the man was sentenced.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Vining said Wednesday he would have
imposed a different sentence on Lemuel M. Stevens had he known
about the Reagan administration's arms sales.
   ``The judge should have all the information he can before he
sentences somebody, and in this case, he didn't,'' said Stevens'
attorney, Robert Stubbs III. ``He didn't have super-duper important
stuff.''
   Vining ruled that Attorney General Edwin Meese's knowledge of
U.S. arms sales to Iran should have been communicated to the
assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Stevens. He said the
government had a duty to disclose information about the scheme to
the defense and the court before sentencing.
   Vining said the government's arms sales to Iran ``in no way
affect the guilt of Stevens,'' who pleaded guilty to conspiring to
ship military equipment to Iran and Chile in 1984, when he was the
president of Marietta-based International Services and Logistics.
   But the judge wrote, ``This court continues to believe that the
government's conduct in selling arms to Iran while prosecuting an
individual for substantially similar conduct (even though such
conduct occurred at an earlier time) is relevant to the sentence to
be imposed ... and should have been disclosed.''
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said the government disagreed with the
ruling, but no decision has been made on an appeal.
   ``It may make sense for policy and practical reasons to
essentially let the matter lie where it is, but we have not reached
that decision yet,'' Barr said.
   ``I'm just grateful for his decision,'' said Stevens, now a
salesman of recreational vehicles. Vining released him on his own
recognizance in June 1987 pending a final order.
   Stubbs said he hoped Vining will re-sentence Stevens to the 17
months he already has served, four months short of the scheduled
release date under federal parole guidelines for his original
three-year sentence.

   Israel today clamped new restrictions on
Palestinians, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told hundreds of
cheering Jewish settlers in the West Bank that Israel would crush
the Palestinian uprising.
   ``We will continue to act against the violence until we stamp it
out,'' Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, told hundreds
of cheering Jewish settlers during a tour of Herodion, 5 miles
south of Bethlehem.
   In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Israeli troops sealed off the
city hall after reports of a bomb threat, Arab witnesses said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz defended his recent meeting
with Arab-Americans who belong to the Palestine Liberation
Organization's parliament-in-exile. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's
ambassador to the United Nations, said he was resigning
immediately, a few weeks earlier than he originally planned, to
speak out against the meeting.
   On Wednesday, when Palestinians observed Land Day, Israel
clamped down on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with
its toughest restrictions in 20 years of occupation.
   Land Day commemorates a confrontation on March 30, 1976, when
Israeli Arabs protested the forced sale of 1,600 acres of their
land for Jewish settlement. Six Arabs were killed.
   The army barred reporters from entering the West Bank and Gaza
Strip except in news pools with an army escort, and restricted the
movement of Palestinians.
   The measures, however, failed to prevent violence. Officials
said four Arabs were shot and killed and 39 were wounded by gunfire
Wednesday, and two were injured in Gaza.
   Israel radio said today the Interior Ministry placed new travel
restrictions on Palestinians from east Jerusalem, where 130,000
Arabs live. Israel annexed the predominantly Arab sector of the
city in 1967.
   It said Palestinians aged 16 to 35 now need special permits to
travel to Jordan, and these will be issued only if the request is
for a stay of at least nine months. The object is to stop the PLO
from sending couriers into the occupied territories.
   In Ramallah, Chamber of Commerce head Hadar Kasis told a
reporter the military authorities informed him Palestinians could
withdraw only $1,000 a month from bank accounts.
   Earlier restrictions bar Arabs from bringing more than $1,200 at
a time across the bridges from Jordan. The moves are designed to
keep the PLO from compensating merchants and workers for loss of
income during anti-Israeli strikes and protests.
   ``We are prepared for anything. ... We can exist just on bread
and zatar (a peppery spice),'' said Kasis, a gift-store owner.
   The Israeli army said it received reports of an explosion in the
Ramallah city hall area about midday today, and Arab witnesses said
soldiers briefly sealed off the area.
   The witnesses said Israeli or municipal officials apparently had
received a bomb threat, but the details were sketchy. Israel sealed
off the West Bank to media Monday night and the movements of
journalists were severely limited.
   The Israeli-appointed acting mayor, Ahmed Assayad, said there
was an unsuccessful attempt late Wednesday to break into the
building. He said he left City Hall about 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EST) and
knew of no attack.
   Underground leaflets signed by the PLO have ordered all Arab
municipal councils to resign, accusing them of collaborating with
Israeli authorities.
   In remarks broadcast today by Israel radio, Shultz reacted to
Israeli protests over his meeting last Saturday with Edward Said
and Ibrahim Abu Lughud. He said it was ``beyond the pale'' to
suggest he could not meet American citizens.
   Shultz also stressed the importance of finding Palestinian
negotiators: ``Palestinians are part of the peace issue. We have
got to find a way to be in contact with them.''
   Netanyahu resigned Wednesday because he contended the Reagan
administration was violating a commitment not to talk directly with
the PLO.
   ``I could not speak freely (about this) as long as I was
ambassador,'' he told The Associated Press.
   Shultz said he would press ahead with his peace initiative _
essentially an exchange of land for peace with the Arabs _ but
would wait until Arabs and Israelis are ready to talk peace before
asking U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez De Cuellar to send out
invitiations to an international conference.
   Violent protests by Palestinians against Israeli rule of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip began Dec. 8.
   Wednesday's fatalities brought to at least 123 the number of
Arabs killed by Israelis in the unrest, according to U.N. figures.
One Israeli soldier has been killed.

   A Nigerian cargo plane loaded with cows, a
limousine and tons of other goods crashed on takeoff from Cairo
International Airport today, killing all four crewmen, including an
American, officials said.
   The DC-8 was chartered by the Egyptian air transport company ZAS
and was bound for Sharjah, one of the seven emirates of the United
Arab Emirates. Ahmed Salem, operations chief of ZAS, told The
Associated Press the plane crashed on desert terrain just beyond
the runway at 4:10 a.m.
   Salem said the American pilot and three Nigerian crew members
were killed. A spokesman for ARAX, the Nigerian firm that owned the
plane, identified the pilot as Ernie Trapaga but didn't know his
age, hometown, or how long he had been with the company.
   Salem identified the American only as Trapanga and said he
didn't know his first name. It wasn't known which spelling of the
name was correct. Egypt's state-owned Middle East News Agency said
he was an American of Spanish origin.
   The ARAX spokesman, at the company's London office, identified
two of the Nigerians as Tony Thomas and Patrick Adjaye. The third
was identified only by his last name, Oladunni. Neither the
spokesman nor Salem had Oladunni's first name.
   The news agency quoted control tower officials as saying the
plane caught fire in the air. The agency said the pilot needed two
tries to get the plane into the air.
   The first time, he sped down the runway but failed to become
airborne.
   The second time, ``the plane caught fire as it was about 50
yards above the ground and crashed in the desert area around the
airport,'' the agency said.
   Airport officials said the aircraft's 28 tons of cargo included
50 cows and a Mercedes Benz limousine.
   Salem said the plane was a replacement for a DC-8 that slid off
a runway Wednesday in Denmark while en route to Cairo to pick up
the cargo. That plane was seriously damaged, and ARAX dispatched
another plane, with a different crew, to Egypt, Salem said.
   The plane involved in today's crash was destroyed, and officials
said the cows were killed.

   Jesse Jackson's campaign is planning an
intense effort to woo Democratic ``super delegates'' as the
likelihood increases that they will determine the party's nominee.
   Jackson aides say the campaign also is planning to seek new
money and hire an advance team, a staple of the other candidates'
campaigns. And they said that as scrutiny of Jackson increases, the
press and public can expect to see him offering more details and
specifics of his various domestic and foreign policy ideas.
   In two days of meetings here this week, Jackson met with his top
financial organizers and with prominent Democratic leaders whom he
hoped to pull into his camp, or at least milk for advice.
   His campaign manager, Gerald Austin, said there will be a
concerted plan to court super delegates, the 645 people who are
automatically Democratic convention delegates by virtue of their
status as party or elected officials.
   They are viewed as critical in this year's campaign, since it
appears no candidate by the end of the primary season will have the
2,082 delegates needed to lock up the nomination. The decision
could rest with the super delegates at the summer nominating
convention in Atlanta.
   So far, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has gained the most
support from established paty leaders. Jackson, who has a slight
lead in the popular vote cast so far, has said the super delegates
should ``respect the super voters'' and back whoever has the most
votes after the last primaries on June 7.
   Austin said the campaign will be phoning the super delegates and
mailing them information on what Jackson has accomplished and
soliciting their support.
   In addition, Jackson's supporters in Congress, particularly
members of the congressional Black Caucus, will contact super
delegates, said Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas.
   ``The front line is the congressional Black Caucus ... to talk
to our colleagues in our states, to lobby people who are super
delegates,'' he said.
   In fund-raising, Jackson's fortunes have grown steadily from a
shoestring budget to a $1-million month in March, the biggest
single fund-raising month of the campaign.
   Campaign aides said that since the March 8 Super Tuesday series
of primaries in 20 states, unsolicited donations have increased
dramatically, augmented by an active direct-mail program.
   ``The phones are ringing in Chicago'' at campaign headquarters,
said Austin. ``People want to get involved _ to do fund raisers in
states we've already contested.''
   Campaign chairman Willie Brown, the speaker of the California
Assembly, said the campaign has raised $1 million in California
alone. He said plans are to continue to increase the pace through a
series of fund-raising techniques and events.
   Jackson, however, spends the money as fast as it comes in and
still lags far behind the big warchest of Democratic money leader
Dukakis, who generally has cash on hand of $3 or $4 million,
according to financial reports.
   Leland said the campaign hopes to raise at least $3 million for
television alone between now and the end of the primary season.
   ``We're going to scorch the earth,'' Leland said.
   Jackson will air TV ads in every upcoming state, but will not
conduct the kind of saturation media effort that other candidates
have used, Austin said.
   ``We're showing you can win elections without spending the kind
of money these guys spend,'' he said.
   Austin said he is interviewing potential candidates to come on
board for advance work, in anticipation of more organization in
upcoming state primaries and caucuses.
   But he said that overall he does not anticipate expanding the
campaign staff of some 90 people, at least for now.
   ``We're just winning. We're going to continue to do what we've
done so far,'' he said.
   Campaign aides said Jackson has no plan to change his basic
message or his ``economic justice'' theme. But political director
Frank Watkins said there may be a few new issues coming out.
   ``We've got a few in the hopper,'' he said.
   In addition, Jackson is ready to offer more details and
specifics of the various programs and ideas he proposes, aides said.
   Watkins said the overall campaign operation has been working
well state-to-state, with the campaign tapping into existing
constituent organizations to serve as the underpinning for the
Jackson operation.
   ``We know who to look for when we go in there _ Hispanic groups,
women's groups, blacks, workers, farmers, environmentalists,
students,'' Watkins said.
   Part of the Jackson strategy, he acknowledged, is to refrain
from public predictions on how Jackson will run in a given contest.
   ``We were convinced we could win it from the beginning but
weren't anxious to wake anybody up,'' he said.
   Jackson leads in the popular vote total of states that have
voted so far, and is running a close second to Dukakis in the
delegate count.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today began closing
its offices for the Easter weekend with most of its employees
unpaid and hopes fading for a mediated settlement to the crisis
over strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   As the government closed down until Monday, a few more shops and
stores reopened their doors in Panama City, widening the cracks in
an 11-day-old general strike aimed at forcing Noriega's ouster.
   The closure of government offices left thousands of public
employees unpaid for the second time this month, despite a new
infusion of an estimated $19 million in quarterly tax revenues.
   About $5.5 million of that money reportedly came from taxes and
fees paid by U.S. companies doing business in Panama, despite a
number of official economic sanctions applied against Panama by the
United States.
   The United States has been trying to pressure Noriega to leave
the country. As head of the 15,000-member Panama Defense Forces, he
is the power behind the civilian government.
   The government, its opposition and the nation's Roman Catholic
leader all expressed doubt at prospects for negotiating an end to
the crisis.
   The reservations were voiced Wednesday just hours after the
mediation initiative involving Archbishop Marcos McGrath was
disclosed.
   McGrath announced through a spokesman on Tuesday that he was
willing to try to negotiate an end to 10 months of political
turmoil that have in the past month deepened into acute crisis.
   On Wednesday, he told journalists he remained willing to
proceed, but added: ``It is evident that for the government and for
the military, this process could be somewhat difficult, because as
far as they are concerned, the church is partial.''
   He said that ``the church has had the moral duty to criticize
those who have used force excessively'' as the government has
harshly suppressed anti-Noriega street protests.
   Baltazar Renan Alzpurua, columnist for the daily newspaper
Critica, which is run by the Defense Forces, expressed even greater
doubts about the archbishop's suitability as a mediator.
   Noreiga was indicted in the United States last month on federal
charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine, charges he denies.
   ``McGrath is from head to toe just another ugly American and he
cannot be the mediator,'' Renan wrote in Wednesday's paper. ``That
would be like inviting a thief to eat at your table.''
   McGrath's parents were U.S. nationals and the churchman still
speaks Spanish with an American accent.
   ``I have not asked to be mediator, and if the mediation can be
carried out by someone else or in another form, so be it,'' he said.
   The archbishop's intervention was proposed Sunday by President
Oscar Arias of Cost Rica and Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime
minister, who was visiting Costa Rica at the time.
   Angelica Guinard, a top leader of the opposition National Civil
Crusade, gave The Associated Press this assessment of the
prospective mediation: ``We don't have much hope of a positive
result. We cannot trust the military.''
   She said the regime's crackdown Monday, when an anti-government
march was smashed by riot troops and more than 20 crusade members
arrested, ``demonstrates that the government has no inclination to
dialogue ... How can you negotiate with someone who's pointing a
pistol at your head?''
   Ms. Guinard said the crusade, an alliance of 200 business, labor
and civic groups spearheading the drive to oust Noriega, is
considering calling off the general strike that has since March 21
shut down most of the country's economic activity. She said it may
have outlived its usefulness.
   Industry, construction and most commerce remained virtually
paralyzed Wednesday, but the city's three major supermarket chains
reopened. Visits to several of the stores found them doing brisk
but orderly business.
   Clients were buying only essentials, especially staples
including rice, oil, beans and milk. Most shoppers also were
stocking up on toilet paper.
   Banks have been closed for four weeks. Cash is extremely scarce,
almost everyone is doing without some things and many people are
nearly desperate.
   The banks closed after a run on deposits precipitated by the
political crisis. Noriega had orchestrated the ouster of President
Eric Delvalle on Feb. 26, hours after Delvalle tried to fire him.
   The United States, continuing to recognize Delvalle, on March 3
froze Panamanian government funds in U.S. banks. Delvalle is in
hiding.

<HEAD>Men Tested Without Permission For AIDS, Suing Doctors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men are suing doctors for allegedly
testing them for AIDS without their permission, complaining their
privacy was violated and that the test results caused them mental
anguish.
   The lawsuits say one of the three considered suicide and another
was forced to leave his home town because of societal pressure
after they were told they tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   Lawyer David Webber, who filed all three suits, said such
testing occurs more often than patients realize.
   ``I believe that such testing is going on all over,'' Webber
said. ``In most cases, people are tested without their knowledge
and simply never know.''
   Anna Forbes, a spokeswoman for Action AIDS, a nonprofit
organization that assists people with AIDS in the Philadelphia
area, said AIDS testing without permission is ``happening far too
frequently.''
   ``Often this testing is being done without consideration of the
impact it has on people and their families,'' she said. ``Telling
people that they are infected with the virus is a psychological
bombshell because you are dealing with an incurable disease.''
   A study published last week in the Journal of the American
Medical Association said 34 percent of 189 U.S. hospitals surveyed
rarely asked patients' permission before testing for the AIDS virus.
   The three men, who were not identified at their request, are
suing the doctors for more than $200,000 in damages. The doctors
and their representatives refused comment to comment on the suits.
   In one lawsuit, filed Wednesday in federal court in Harrisburg,
a 40-year-old man contends he was forced to leave his home after he
tested positive for exposure to the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. He said his physician never asked his
permission.
   The man said although he is infected with the virus, he does not
have AIDS or AIDS-related diseases.
   The plaintiff in another suit, filed in Philadelphia Common
Pleas Court, said he went to a hospital for treatment of a minor
eye infection and gave permission for a blood test but not for an
AIDS test. He contemplated suicide after he was told he tested
positive for AIDS, according to the suit.
   In the third suit, also filed in Philadelphia court, the
plaintiff alleges that he was tested for the AIDS virus without
permission after he went to her for a premarital blood test. A
second test showed he was not infected.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan and Pakistani President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq agreed during telephone talks to continue
aiding Afghan resistance forces after Soviet troops leave
Afghanistan if the Soviets continue backing the Kabul regime, U.S.
officials said today.
   The officials also confirmed reports that the Reagan
administration is actively involved in a new effort to settle the
aid issue with the Soviets.
   ``The United States has not and will not stop assisting the
Afghan resistance unless the Soviets stop aiding the Kabul
regime,'' State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   She said Reagan and Zia ``reaffirmed'' this view during a
telephone conversation on Wednesday.
   There has been concern within the administration that Pakistan _
through which U.S. assistance to the guerrillas is funnelled _
would halt the flow of aid once an agreement is signed.
   Pakistan is eager for a settlement and a Soviet troop withdrawal
because a pact would presumably permit millions of Afghan refugees
in Pakistan to return to their homeland.
   The presidents' conversation and a flurry of diplomatic activity
with the Soviets are part of an effort to finish a U.N.-sponsored
accord that would permit the orderly withdrawal of the Soviet
Union's 115,000 troops from Afghanistan and require a cessation of
outside aid to the guerrillas.
   The United States has agreed in principle to be a ``guarantor''
of the agreement, but has insisted it will stop aiding the Afghan
rebels after Soviet withdrawal only if Moscow stops sending
supplies and financial support to the Afghan government. The
Soviets have said they have a right to continue such aid under
treaties with the Kabul government.
   A State Department official today confirmed reports in The
Washington Post and The New York Times that the United States would
ask the Soviets to agree to a continuation of the two superpowers'
aid to their clients in the Afghan struggle.
   Instead of agreeing to a parallel cessation of aid, Moscow and
Washington would agree to a parallel continuation of assistance,
according to the proposal.
   During talks in Washington last week, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze reportedly did not specifically reject the
idea, but a State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said ``it would go too far to say he agreed to consider
it.
   ``There is some disagreement'' even within the administration on
how to interpret Shevardnadze's comments, the official added.
   Publicly, at a news conference March 23, Shevardnadze rejected
calls for a cessation of Soviet aid.
   The U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said some
administration figures were concerned about the legality of the
United States signing an Afghan peace accord that required a cutoff
of aid to the resistance forces while agreeing separately with the
Soviets to continue such assistance.

   The Warsaw Pact has offered to hold
separate talks on conventional forces and battlefield nuclear arms
and urged the superpowers to sign by July 1 a pact to halve their
long-range nuclear arsenals.
   The Soviet-led alliance's seven foreign ministers also said
Wednesday after a two-day meeting in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia
that the superpowers should agree to abide by the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Moscow says the treaty bars
development of a space-based missile defense system.
   The Warsaw Pact foreign ministers urged NATO to begin talks this
year on reducing conventional forces in Europe and backed down from
a longstanding position by offering separate negotiations on
battlefield nuclear weapons.
   The offer appeared aimed at overcoming a more than year-old
absence of movement toward new talks on reducing conventional
forces across Europe.
   ``We welcome the statements of the Warsaw Pact foreign ministers
... to the extent that they seem to reflect some of the concerns of
NATO members,'' said a NATO statement released today in Brussels,
Belgium.
   The statement added that it was important that the Warsaw Pact's
words be translated into concrete proposals at the negotiating
table.
   The appeals, published by the Bulgarian news agency BTA and
monitored in Vienna, indicated Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
is eager to seal a pact on intercontinental nuclear missiles but
not insisting it be ready to sign when he meets President Reagan in
Moscow May 29 to June 2.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vadim Loginov told journalists in
Sofia that the Kremlin still hopes the agreement can be signed
during the Moscow summit.
   But the Warsaw Pact statement indicated Moscow links a pact on
strategic arms to adherence to the 1972 ABM treaty, which sets
limits on superpower missile defenses.
   The Reagan administration has argued that the ABM accord permits
research and testing of the its space-based missile defense
project, popularly called ``Star Wars.'' Moscow insists the ABM
accord rules out any such system.
   The Warsaw Pact statement said talks on what the 16-nations
North Atlantic Treaty Organization calls conventional stability
should begin this year, but set no time for the separate
negotations on tactical nuclear and dual capability weapons.
   East-West disagreement over how to count Warsaw Pact and NATO
troop levels has stalled Vienna talks on reducing conventional
forces in central Europe since they opened in 1973. Those
negotations are likely to be wound down if new talks on
conventional stability are started.
   Agreement on new talks on conventional forces may pave the way
for settlement of other disputes, including human rights issues.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramilitary troops killed nine people
and injured 36 when they fired on a group of people who threw
stones at the soldiers' camp, news reports said today.
   Indian newspapers said the firing Tuesday night and Wednesday by
a unit of the paramilitary Assam Rifles occurred in Aizawl, the
capital of the northeastern state of Mizoram.
   A nighttime curfew was clamped on the town about 990 miles east
of New Delhi.
   Mizoram was the scene of a 20-year guerrilla war for
independence until 1986, when a peace accord was signed with the
Indian government.
   It was unclear what set off the incident, but the United News of
India said the civilians were angered over an alleged assault on a
local policeman Tuesday by members of the paramilitary unit.
   State Chief Minister Laldenga has asked Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi to remove Assam Rifles personnel from Mizoram for mutiny and
rebellion against the government, UNI said.
   Laldenga was the leader of the independence movement.
   The movement was fueled by what local residents, mainly members
of the Mizo tribe, perceived as a cultural threat from settlements
by Assamese and other ethnic groups from the west.
   The Assam Rifles were deployed in Mizoram during the guerrilla
war and remained after the peace pact as a reserve police force.
   UNI did not give details of the assault on the local policeman,
but many former guerrillas have been inducted into the state police
force since the accord was signed.

<TEXT>
   A man who has already been convicted
in one killing will go on trial here Monday on charges of
soliciting contract killings through Soldier of Fortune magazine,
officials said.
   Richard Michael Savage, 39, had been scheduled for trial earlier
this month in Houston, but U.S. District Judge James DeAnda granted
a change of venue after ruling Savage could not get a fair trial
there because of publicity in an unrelated civil case involving
Soldier of Fortune.
   On March 3, a federal civil jury in Houston awarded a $9.4
million judgment against Soldier of Fortune when it found the
magazine was negligent by publishing a classified advertisement
that led to a woman's slaying. Savage was not involved in that
killing.
   Gary Cobe, the assistant U.S. attorney in Houston who will
prosecute Savage, declined comment on the case Wednesday, but
confirmed the trial will begin Monday.
   Savage is already serving a 40-year prison term in Florida for
arranging the 1985 beating death of former West Palm Beach
Assistant City Manager Anita Spearman through an advertisement in
Soldier of Fortune.
   Alice V. Brado allegedly hired Savage through a Soldier of
Fortune advertisement to kill Dana Free.
   Savage was indicted in October 1986 along with Ms. Brado and
others in the murder-for-hire scheme. Among the charges against him
are four counts of use of interstate commerce facilities in the
commission of murder for hire, aiding and abetting, according to
the U.S. district clerk's office in Houston.
   Ms. Brado allegedly hired Savage through an ad in the magazine
to arrange the death of Free, whom she said absconded with her
$300,000 life savings. She pleaded guilty to charges stemming from
the scheme and died of emphysema in a Kentucky prison while serving
a five-year term.
   The indictment stated Brado paid Savage $20,000 to arrange
Free's murder, to have been carried out by William Clayton Buckley,
36, and Sherry Lynn Breeden, 22, both of Knoxville, Tenn.
   The pair allegedly tried to bomb Free's car in Atlanta during
June 1985, but Free escaped. On Oct. 12, 1985, two grenades were
thrown through his living room window, but no one was injured.
   Buckley and Ward C. Lambeth, a 61-year-old co-defendant, also
have pleaded guilty to charges in connection with the grenade
attack.

   A man has been arrested on charges linked to
a drug ring that was allegedly involved with Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, authorities said.
   Kenneth Mark Kiken, 37, was captured Wednesday in the southern
New Jersey town of Avalon on a fugitive warrant, John C. McGinley,
head of the FBI's New Jersey office. Kiken was arrested after a
routine license check by Avalon police on an out-of-state license
plate, he said.
   Kiken was named in a two-count indictment last January charging
him with conspiring to import and attempting to import 165,000
pounds of marijuana seized by the U.S. Coast Guard seized in
October 1985.
   The shipment was included in a June 1986 indictment in Tampa,
Fla. accusing Leigh Bruce Ritch and Steven Kalish of running a drug
ring that imported millions of pounds of marijuana and thousands of
pounds of cocaine into the United States.
   Kalish, who was arrested in July 1984, pleaded guilty,
cooperated with authorities in the investigation of Noriega and was
sentenced Feb. 25 to 14 years in prison, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Mark Jackowski in Tampa.
   Noriega was indicted Feb. 4 for taking $4 million from Kalish
and Ritch in payoffs to protect their operation and with laundering
more than $100 million of the ring's profits.
   The Noriega indictment covers the time period of June 1983 to
July 1984, and Jackowski said the government does not allege a
specific link between the charges against the Panamanian strongman
and the charges against Kiken.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Lucy McClain in Camden said Kiken waived
bail, a lawyer and opposition to sending him to Tampa authorities.
   Jackowski said Kiken would likely be brought to Florida next
week or the week after.
   Ritch was sentenced to 30 years for his conviction on the 1986
Tampa indictment, Jackowski said.

   A bookkeeper who admitted she shot her boss
to death has been acquitted of second-degree murder after
testifying that she was a victim of sexual harassment.
   Roxanna Ullery, 23, told a circuit court jury she killed Wayne
Evans at his Winter Park home Feb. 16, 1987, because he moved
threateningly toward her and a friend and she feared he was about
to rape and kill them.
   Ms. Ullery was convicted Wednesday of carrying a concealed
weapon and shooting a firearm, and prosecutors said she would
likely get a year of probation.
   The defendant said Evans, 30, owner of Cinco Construction Co.,
continually made lewd comments during her six months on the job and
would lift up her dress, fondle her breasts and call her into his
office where he would be masturbating.
   However, prosecutors claimed Ms. Ullery shot Evans because he
found out earlier in the day that she was embezzling money by
writing paychecks to people who did not work at the company. He
called her to his home to discuss the embezzlement, prosecutors
said.
   Jurors looked at checks totaling $9,000 that prosecutors said
Ms. Ullery signed and cashed. She said she did that at his
direction and that he had withheld more than $160,000 in Social
Security taxes from the government.
   The defense said Evans threatened her with jail if she didn't do
what he wanted.
   ``He threatened to turn her in and kill her and her son,'' said
defense attorney Charles Willits. ``What it amounted to was
psychological warfare.''

   Every time Wilburn ``Sonny'' Cockrell goes to
work, he plunges 230 feet into a Florida sinkhole and 12,000 years
into the past.
   Cockrell is an underwater archaeologist who is harvesting relics
from the Pleistocene Epoch, some of them human, from the depths of
Warm Mineral Springs, the spa that bills itself as Ponce de Leon's
``fountain of youth.''
   Cockrell's work as director of Florida State University's
research project is examined in an episode of PBS' ``Discoveries
Underwater,'' airing Monday. The eight-part documentary series from
KCET-TV Los Angeles and the BBC looks at shipwrecks, sunken
treasures and the lost city of Atlantis.
   The age of the bones in the Warm Mineral Springs sinkhole has
been established by carbon dating at about 12,000 years.
   ``I feel early man used this place to dispose of the dead,''
said Cockrell, a tall man with thick sandy hair and a big beard
starting to show gray. ``We've found the remains of more than 20
men so far. We've also found the bones of a giant ground sloth, a
saber-toothed cat, a North American horse and a type of camel
related to the llama.
   ``The climate was much cooler then. There were no palm trees and
very few pines. We've found trees down there, some nuts and pollen.
What we're trying to do is understand the humans against this
background.''
   The human remains are Paleo-Indians. Based on their skeletons,
they averaged about 5-foot-4 in height and 110 pounds in weight.
Cockrell said the skulls resemble those found in a cave in China
more than those of southeastern Indians.
   The bones have been preserved because the water in the sinkhole
has no oxygen. It is also very warm and has a high mineral content,
thus attracting many people to it for bathing, despite the
sulfurous smell.
   Cockrell has also pulled up relics from more recent times,
including Coca-Cola bottles and a deer skull.
   ``My principal interest as an underwater archaeologist is
looking for sites from the Ice Age that are now underwater,''
Cockrell said. ``Since the ice caps melted, the ocean level has
risen 300 feet worldwide. We were looking in the wrong places to
find early man. We should be looking for those sites that are now
up to 300 feet beneath the ocean.
   ``This sinkhole was once a cave that collapsed about 30,000
years ago. Things have been falling into it since then. We're
digging through many generations.''
   Diving to the bottom of the hole, 230 feet down at its deepest,
is dangerous and scary. It's pitch black at the bottom. It takes 93
minutes to decompress on the way up.
   Prior to coming to Warm Mineral Springs, Cockrell was Florida's
underwater archaeologist. That was a job that put him in daily
contact with underwater treasure salvagers, including Mel Fisher,
who found the multimillion-dollar wreck of the Atocha.
   Not all salvagers are legitimate, Cockrell said.
   ``Most of the money in finding sunken treasure is made on dry
land by people selling shares in shady salvage schemes,'' he said.
``There are also a lot of phony treasure maps for sale. We even
found one that was copied from the placemat at a fast food
restaurant. Some people are making big money selling cheap dental
gold in bars to look like Spanish gold.''
   Cockrell spent much of his time trying to preserve underwater
wrecks from predatory salvagers. He is a strong supporter of a bill
now before Congress to protect underwater wrecks.
   ``This bill would preserve wrecks for sport divers to visit,''
he said. ``It would not prevent anyone from diving on a wreck. It
would only prevent taking anything from a wreck without a permit.
Legitimate salvagers would still be able to recover treasure.''
   Cockrell, a native of Alabama, has been diving since 1959. He
originally began as a paleontologist but switched to archaeologist.
   ``My first dig was in Alabama for a zeuglodon, which was an
ancient whale with a neck,'' he said. ``You find a lot of whale
bones in Alabama. People even used them for building houses.''

   Extra officers were called to the
Talladega Federal Correctional Institute to quell an hour-long
disturbance involving Cuban prisoners, a spokeswoman said today.
   No injuries were reported in the Wednesday incident, but guards
had to use a tear gas-like chemcial agent on four detainees who
resisted officers, said Karen Stephens.
   ``At no time was the security or safety of the facility in
danger,'' she said. Ms. Stephens said it was unclear what prompted
the disturbance.
   Brian Ross, another spokesman for the facility, said the
disturbance was confined to one cell block holding 16 Cubans. He
said they made a lot of noise and covered the front of the block so
they could not be seen or counted.
   The Talladega prison holds 167 Cuban detainees, some of whom
were transferred to the facility following uprisings at federal
prisons in Atlanta and Oakdale, La., late last year.
   The Cubans arrived in the United States during the 1980 Mariel
boat lift.

<HEAD>Human-Powered Plane Makes Successful Test Flight</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with no flight scheduled Friday.

<DATELINE>IRAKLION, Crete (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-tech human-powered aircraft made a
successful series of test flights today in preparation for a
world-record distance attempt that also will recreate the ancient
Daedalus myth.
   But organizers of the Daedalus project called off plans for a
record bid on Friday because southerly gales were expected with
winds gusting up to 30 mph.
   Flight Director Steve K. Bussulari told reporters that the
68-pound ultralight Daedalus 88 ``is in good shape ... and we may
see favorable conditions'' for a flight on Saturday or Sunday.
   The aircraft completed six flights lasting less than three
minutes each in calm dawn weather above a Greek air force base
adjoining Iraklion airport.
   Five athlete pilots took turns to pedal the shimmering
pink-and-silver plane at speeds of around 14 mph, flying about 15
feet above the tarmac.
   The three-year Massachusetts Institute of Technology project
aims at breaking the world record for human-powered flight over the
74-mile distance from Crete to the island of Santorini, also known
as Thira.
   The flight also will update the myth of Daedalus. According to
the 3,500-year-old myth, the inventor and his son, Icarus, tried to
escape from Crete on wings made of feathers and wax. Daedalus
succeeded, but Icarus flew too close to the sun, the wax melted and
he fell into the sea.
   After nine days of blustery weather, conditions today appeared
near-perfect for the Santorini flight, which requires temperatures
below 70 degrees Fahrenheit and almost dead calm, a rare occurrence
on this wind-swept southern island.
   ``It feels like a day for the record, pretty calm. I was flying
the plane with no hands,'' said Frank Scioscia, 27, a professional
cyclist from Scranton, Pa.
   Bussulari, an MIT aerospace expert who will make the decision to
fly, said the record probably could have been set today, although
the plane would have met strong headwinds about five miles off
Santorini.
   ``But we felt we needed a test flight to shake down the
aeroplane,'' he said.
   The pilots _ four Americans and one Greek _ are taking turns to
stand by for 48 hours in readiness for the flight. The pilot who
had been scheduled to fly Friday is Greg Zack, 26, of Wilmington,
N.C., whose father was born in Greece.
   The pilot pumps bicycle pedals that turn the contraption's
propeller, and steers the plane with a joystick, coordinating with
ground-based radio instructions.
   ``For the record the pilot must keep pedaling a steady 15 mph
but the effort is equivalent to riding 23 miles an hour on land,''
said Glenn Tremml, a medical student from New Haven, Conn.
   Tremml set the 37.2-mile world record for human-powered flight
in California in 1987, flying a Daedalus prototype.
   After an unassisted takeoff, the pilot will skirt the offshore
island of Dia and head due north hoping to land on a sandy beach on
Santorini.
   Two Greek navy patrol boats and a flotilla of inflatable crafts
will escort the plane across the Aegean sea, ready to pick up the
pilot if he crashes and salvage the aircraft, although it probably
would be unuseable.
   Two backup flying machines are ready for assembly here if needed.
   Like Daedalus 88, they are constructed of lightweight composite
material _ graphite epoxy, plastic fiber and mylar, an extra-thin
plastic skin that covers the jetliner-sized 112-foot wingspan.
   The $1 million Daedalus project, with its 36-member team, has
produced new information on endurance and low altitude flying
aerodynamics and meteorology during its three years of development,
its organizers said.
   ``The project does have a research and educational application,
particularly in human physiology and aeronautics,'' said John S.
Langford, the project director. ``The plane itself doesn't have any
practical application. It should be seen as a work of art.''

<HEAD>Heavy Snows As Latest Spring Storm Blankets Colorado</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   March roared out of Colorado like a lion today,
pounding some areas with nearly two feet of snow and making travel
treacherous on snowy and ice-packed roads throughout the state.
   The storm caused numerous minor accidents during the morning
rush hour, giving motorists a longer-than-usual commute and
creating visibilities of near zero at times.
   ``The roads will continue to be pretty nasty,'' said National
Weather Service forecaster Mike Holzinger. ``I guess we would say
this is a worse-than-average storm. But we do get this kind of
weather in the spring.''
   At Stapleton International Airport at Denver, crowded with
travelers for the Easter weekend, public affairs officer Norm Avery
warned that delays of two hours or more could be expected.
   The snow and gusting winds were expected to continue through
tonight, with as much as 20 inches of snow possible in Denver's
western suburbs, Holzinger said. The weather service was calling
for total accumulations of up to 30 inches in the foothills.
   Snow emergencies were declared for Douglas, Arapahoe and Adams
counties and for the city fo Fort Collins, where more than a foot
of snow had fallen, but the Colorado State Patrol said there were
no reports of serious accidents.
   Stapleton officials said only the two main north-south runways
were being used early today because of winds out of the north.
Snowfall by 8 a.m. measured 8 inches at the airport, the weather
service said.
   Stapleton has about 650 departures and about an equal number of
arrivals daily, Avery noted. ``I would anticipate we'll see some
cancellations today and greatly impaired traffic operations because
of visibility,'' he said.
   ``Our biggest problem is we can't plow visibility. The snow is
not the problem. It's the lack of visibility it creates that is the
problem,'' he said.

   A leaky fuel pipe spilling oil onto
a hot engine is believed to have triggered a fire that crippled the
cruise ship Scandinavian Star earlier this month near Cancun,
Mexico.
   The leak occured in an inch-thick pipe that carries oil to the
main engine on the starboard side, said Lou Colucciello of the
National Transporation Safety Board. The pipe apparently leaked
near the engine and the oil ignited when it spilled on the hot
surface, he said.
   The fire March 16 on the St. Petersburg-based ship stranded 447
passengers on the return leg of a Mexican cruise about 35 miles off
the Yucatan peninsula.
   The passengers were flown back to Tampa.
   A four-member team from the NTSB Marine Accident Division spent
last week inspecting the ship in Miami and returned to Washington
to conduct more tests and analyze findings, Colucciello said.
   He said investigators have found no other possible cause;
however, the findings won't be conclusive until they test a piece
of pipe and some of the ship's fuel at a laboratory.

<HEAD>At Least 17 Killed As Tamils Attack Moslem Villages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tamil militants attacked and set fire
to two Moslem fishing villages in eastern Sri Lanka today, and at
least 17 people were killed, Indian and Sri Lankan sources said.
   The sources said the attackers burned a mosque and more than 80
mud-and-straw houses in villages near Kalmunai, 137 miles northeast
of Colombo, the capital. The sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Some reports said the death toll was higher. There also was
confusion over how many of the dead were Tamils and how many were
Moslems because a battle apparently broke out after the initial
attack.
   Moslems make up 7 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. They
have been caught up only rarely in the Tamil rebels' nearly
five-year war against the dominant Sinhalese for a separate Tamil
nation.
   But the Moslems make up about one-third of the population in
eastern Sri Lanka, which the rebels want as part of their homeland,
and they recently have come under attack.
   Under an Indian-sponsored peace accord, a vote is be held in the
island's north and east for a temporary council to rule the two
areas as one province.
   Both Sinhalese and Moslem leaders charge that the Tamils are
trying to drive out members of the other two communities to gain
political advantage.
   An Indian diplomat in Colombo said Indian peacekeeping troops
investigating the attack found 17 bodies in the villages of
Sainthamaruthu and Malaiyandu.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition her name not be used, said
six people also were injured. ``Indian troops have now moved a
battalion to the stricken villages,'' she said.
   India mantains about 40,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka under a peace
accord signed last July.
   A police official in Kalmunai, who also spoke anonymously, said
86 houses, all belonging to Moslem fisherman, were burned to the
ground. Many people fled into the nearby jungle, he said.
   Mohamad Ashroof, general secretary of the Sri Lankan Moslem
Congress, said in Colombo that he had firm reports the death toll
was 20 Moslems, including six who perished after taking refuge in
the mosque.
   But sources in the coastal city of Batticaloa, north of
Kalmunai, said survivors' accounts indicated 17 died, including
seven Tamils killed when Moslem villagers tried to repulse the
attack.
   The largest rebel militia, the Liberation Tigers, have been
operating in eastern Sri Lanka since being driven out of their
stronghold in the north by Indian troops.
   They have resisted the peace accord, which calls on the rebels
to give up their fight in exchange for more autonomy for Tamils.
   Tamils, mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the population.
They claim they are discriminated against by the Buddhist
Sinhalese, who form 75 percent and dominate the government and
military.
   Within the last month, nearly 150 civilians have been killed in
Sri Lanka's Eastern Province in attacks blamed on the Tamil rebels.
   Within the past week more than 30 Moslem-owned homes and
businesses have been looted or set afire in Kalmunai. Two weeks ago
seven Moslem businessmen in the area were kidnapped and are still
missing.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty Polish Gypsies who were arrested
at Los Angeles International Airport while carrying jewelry-stuffed
bags are part of an elusive nationwide burglary ring, authorities
said.
   Nineteen of the 20 men and women pleaded innocent in Pasadena
Municipal Court on Monday and Tuesday to charges of receiving
stolen property. One suspect is still to be arraigned.
   Sheriff's Detective Terry Wiese, who has tracked members of the
group since 1984, said they specialized in rifling senior citizens'
houses from coast to coast, often while the victims were at home.
   Group members are wanted in connection with a string of similar
burglaries across the country and in Canada, he said.
   ``We haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg, that's how big
we believe this activity is across the United States,'' Wiese said.
   Los Angeles Police Detective Larry Kagele, working with more
than two dozen law enforcement agencies in the case, said the
Gypsies would drive through affluent neighborhoods looking for
senior citizens standing outside their homes, watering their lawns
or chatting with neighbors.
   While a man remained at the wheel of the car, a woman would ask
the homeowner for directions or a drink of water. A second woman
would sneak into the house and rummage through bedroom dressers and
closets in search of jewelry, expensive heirlooms and silver,
Kagele said.
   ``If the woman was seen inside the house, she would make up a
quick story that she's looking for a `Joe' or `Sandy' and must have
the wrong address,'' Kagele said. ``It wasn't all that
sophisticated, but it worked.''
   Still wanted is the group's alleged Gypsy ``queen,'' Danuta
Reszuta, 31, authorities said.
   All 20 people arrested last week have been charged with one
count of receiving stolen property and held in lieu of $500,000
bail each. Police said the high bail was needed because alleged
members of the group have fled before trial in the past.
   Polish translators are assisting the Gypsies because none of the
20 speak enough English to follow their court proceedings.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service agents also are reviewing
their files on the suspicion that several may be in the United
States illegally.

   Here is a rundown of the legal problems that
have faced Attorney General Edwin Meese III in recent years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>July 26, 1983</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   White House counsel Fred F. Fielding begins reviewing
allegations that Meese, then White House counselor, and Michael
Deaver, at the time White House deputy chief of staff, received
$118,000 in loans arranged by John R. McKean, a tax accountant
later appointed to the Postal Service board of governors.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Sept. 27, 1983</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An Army inspector general finds that Meese's promotion to
colonel in the Army Reserve violated procedures, but said no
evidence was found of use of ``undue influence.'' The investigative
recommended against revoking Meese's promotion. Meese's promotion
was approved by Maj. Gen. William R. Berkman, whose reappointment
as chief of the Army Reserve was confirmed by the Senate on Feb.
24, 1983, the same day Meese's promotion was approved.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>March 27, 1984</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General William French Smith asks for a special
prosecutor to investigate allegations against Meese, who had
recently been nominated to be French's successor. The investigation
was prompted by reports that Meese failed to list on his financial
disclosure form an interest-free $15,000 loan his wife received
from Edwin Thomas. Thomas, his wife and son were appointed to
federal jobs. The investigation also would look into other
transactions, including the loan from McKean.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>April 5, 1984</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Senate investigators begin looking into Meese's failure to
report reimbursements he received for more than 30 trips he took as
White House counselor. One day later, former President Ford
suggests that Meese should resign, although Ford says he does not
believe Meese has broken any laws.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Sept. 20, 1984</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Special prosecutor Jacob A. Stein concludes there is no basis
for prosecuting Meese for ethical mistakes, and a three-judge panel
accepts the counsel's report. Stein had investigated 11 allegations
concerning Meese, including charges that Meese played a role in
awarding jobs to Thomas and his family in exchange for a $15,000
interest-free loan.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Jan. 28, 1985</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Two Office of Government Ethics staff concludes that Meese, then
attorney general-designate, violated conflict-of-interest rules,
but is overruled by the agency director. The preliminary finding
was changed after Meese's lawyers submitted a rebuttal. The staff
report found violations involving two individuals who helped Meese
financially and received high government jobs.
   After considerable debate, the Senate votes to confirm Meese and
he is sworn in as attorney general on Feb. 25, 1985.

   Meese announces that the United States secretly sold weapons to
Iran and that profits of between $10 million and $30 million were
diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. National security adviser
John M. Poindexter resigns and NSC aide Lt. Col. Oliver L. North is
fired.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dec. 18, 1986</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility
investigates Meese's decision to delay an FBI probe of an airline
involved in Iranian arms deals and weapons shipments to the
Contras. The Justice Department says Poindexter asked Meese in
October to delay the inquiry of Southern Air Transport, formerly
owned by the CIA. The FBI assists in investigating the 10-day delay.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Jan. 7, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department requests an independent counsel to
investigate allegations that former White House aide Lyn Nofziger
may have violated federal ethics laws by lobbying for the Wedtech
Corp., a defense contractor, shortly after leaving public office in
1983. The decision requesting a counsel is made by a deputy to
Meese, who removed himself from considering the request because he
knows Nofziger.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>April 6, 1987</HEAD>

   Meese acknowledges that he intervened on behalf of Wedtech to
ensure that it got a fair hearing from the Army in its effort to
win the engine contract. Meese also says his friend and former
lawyer, E. Robert Wallach, sent him a series of memorandums in 1981
and 1982 discussing Wedtech.

   The chairmen of the Senate and House judiciary committees ask
James McKay, the independent counsel, whether he can expand his
criminal investigation to include Meese's involvement with Wedtech.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>May 11, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Meese asks the special prosecutor investigating Nofziger's ties
to Wedtech to include him in the investigation. Meese also
announces that he has terminated his financial partnership with W.
Franklyn Chinn. In February, Chinn was forced to resign from the
Wedtech board because of allegedly questionable financial
transactions.

<TEXT>
   Sources familiar with the grand jury investigation into the
Iran-Contra affair tell The Associated Press that White House aides
who complained that Lt. Col. Oliver North may have been violating
the law were told Meese had approved North's actions.
   The sources also said Meese and North held meetings on a regular
basis before the Iran-Contra affair unraveled. The Justice
Department says Meese gave no legal clearance for North's
activities.

<HEAD>Jue 30, 1987</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Government Ethics says Meese violated financial
disclosure requirements after investing $60,000 with Chinn. The
agency's director said Meese voluntarily invested the money in 1985
under an arrangement that fails to qualify as a blind trust under
the 1978 Ethics in Government Act.

   A 9-year-old boy was in a coma Thursday
after he tried to hang himself, apparently after he saw a TV news
report of a mass suicide.
   Thaveesak Rojanapitakcheep was sent to Bangkok's Phetchavej
Hospital Tuesday after he was found suspended from a nylon rope,
which was attached to a hook used to hold a punching bag, doctors
said.
   Dr. Suchon Suriyayothin quoted the boy's father, Chaisit
Rojanapitakcheep, as saying that his son often talked about the
highly publicized suicides earlier this month.
   In that incident, six members of a family hanged themselves at
their home in Nonthaburi province near Bangkok in what police
described as a fit of religious fanaticism.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney shuffled his
Cabinet today with major changes in the controversial trade and
immigration portfolios. Mulroney faces a re-election campaign later
in the year.
   International Trade Minister Pat Carney, noted for her combative
style, was replaced by former Transport Minister John Crosbie, who
will take over responsibility for implementing the free-trade
agreement negotiated last year with the United States.
   The agreement dismantles tariffs and other trade barriers over
the next decade. It faces a ratification battle in Parliament later
this year and stubborn opposition from at least two of Canada's 10
provinces.
   Carney takes over as president of the Treasury Board, a post
formerly held by Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski.
   Changing more than a quarter of his 38-member Cabinet, Mulroney
replaced both Immigration Minister Benoit Bouchard and his deputy,
Gerry Weiner, following two years in which Canada has struggled to
curb an influx of up to 2,000 illegal aliens a month.
   Bouchard takes over as transport minister while Weiner becomes
minister of state for multiculturalism.
   Barbara McDougall, formerly in charge of women's affairs and
privatization, becomes immigration minister.
   In a surprise move, Mulroney reached outside Parliament to name
his old school friend Lucien Bouchard, recently Canada's ambassador
to France, his new secretary of state. He replaces David Crombie,
who resigned on Wednesday to take up a new government job as head
of a royal commission on the development of the Lake Ontario
waterfront in Toronto.
   The only other newcomer in the Cabinet is Vancouver-area member
of Parliament Gerry St. Germain, who becomes minister of state for
transport, the equivalent of a deputy minister.
   Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party was elected to a
five-year term in September 1984. He is expected to call an early
election this fall.

<HEAD>Government Cancels Dam Project Near Prague</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has canceled a
long-planned project to build a dam and hydroelectric power station
in a river valley west of Prague because it would cause ecological
damage, it was reported Thursday.
   Ecologists said it was the first case when a major project has
been canceled for ecology reasons in Czechoslovakia, expressing the
growing official and popular concern over increased pollution, the
Communist daily Rude Pravo reported.
   Serious objections to the Krivoklat dam, which was initiated in
the 1960s, were raised by the Ministry of Culture and local
officials, and that led to several postponements of the project.
   In 1977 the United Nations Educational and Science Organization
declared that the area should be preserved.
   Flooding in the Berounka river valley would destroy fauna and
flora surviving in the area since the Ice Age, as well as valuable
forests which are to be used to revitalize the tens of thousands of
acres of woods damaged by pollution in this country, ecologists say.
   The decision, however, was not expected to change official plans
for Czechoslovakia's most grandiose current project: the
construction of a giant dam and hydroelectric plant on the Danube
where it crosses the Hungarian border.
   Hungarian and Austrian environmentalists have said the project
will alter water levels and damage forests and farmland across a
wide area. But Czechoslovakia's planners are still going ahead with
a plant they say will provide enough power to reduce the burning of
sulfur-laden brown coal by 3.8 million tons a year.
   Brown coal and other materials used to fuel a rapid 1950s
industrialization inspired by the Soviets' Stalinist efforts have
inflicted great damage on the environment in Czechoslovakia, a
landlocked country whose natural assets are its forests and rivers.
   The damage grew unhindered throughout the 1970s, while the West
woke up to ecological issues. Now, a similar consciousness has
arisen in Czechoslovakia, causing popular alarm and forcing the
government to finance projects designed to restore environmental
standards to 1970 levels by the next millenium.

<HEAD>Zhao Ziyang Advises Nation Against Meat-Eating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang is calling on
the nation to eat less meat and more vegetables because farmers
can't grow enough grain to feed livestock.
   Zhao, speaking Wednesday with delegates to the current session
of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, said China
should learn from developed countries, where nutritionists are
discouraging excess consumption of meat.
   Zhao's comments, carried Thursday by the official Xinhua News
Agency, follow several articles in the official media warning that
the rapid increase in meat consumption can't continue amid
stagnating grain production.
   Since 1983, consumption of meat, poultry, eggs and fish has
risen 10 percent annually while agricultural production has gone up
only 2 percent or 3 percent a year.
   Last year, most large Chinese cities for the first time in
decades began rationing pork, China's favorite meat, because
farmers strapped by rising feed costs and low government prices for
pigs were not meeting the rising demand for pork.
   Zhao backed up a statement by acting Premier Li Peng, who in his
report at the opening of the congress last week said that ``for a
relatively long time, because of the restrictions imposed by the
amount of grain held per capita, a major increase in supplies of
meat, poultry, eggs and other animal food products will not be
possible.''
   Zhao said the government should guide the eating habits of the
nation just as it has held down population growth with its one
child policy.
   ``Since we've made world-acknowledged achievements in family
planning, why can't we guide the people in their food pattern?'' he
said.
   Zhao suggested that higher prices for pork could be used to
guide people to eat more chicken and rabbit than pork.
   China's grain production hit a record 407 million tons in 1984
but has failed to equal that since then. In the same period, grain
consumption, largely because of increased demand for meat products,
has increased by 15 million tons annually.
   The government must attain its optimistic goal of increasing
grain production to 500 million tons by the year 2000 just to keep
per-capita levels at the current 880 pounds because of population
growth.
   Last year, the average Chinese ate a little more than 37 pounds
of meat, including about 31 pounds of pork. The average American in
1984 consumed 143{ pounds of meat.

   The FBI cracked a major heroin-importing ring
involving trafficking through Sicily with the arrest today of more
than 200 organized crime figures, Justice Department sources said.
   The arrests are the result of a lengthy criminal investigation
in cooperation with Italian authorities, said the sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The government obtained warrants for the arrest of 45 people in
New York City, 11 in the nation's capital and 160 in Italy,
according to one source.
   Arrests were also expected in other cities, possibly including
Houston, Charlotte, N.C., and Los Angeles as well as in Florida,
the source said.
   The operation began in Washington in the fall of 1986 when an
undercover agent began purchasing drugs from a waiter at a local
restaurant, according to the source.
   Large quantities of cocaine and heroin were purchased in
Washington between October 1986 and last fall, the source said.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III and FBI officials were
scheduled to disclose details of the case at a news conference
later today at FBI headquarters in Washington.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan may start campaigning for George Bush early
this summer, the White House said today, giving his vice president
an early start on the fall campaign. Democratic presidential
contender Albert Gore Jr. criticized Jesse Jackson anew and asked
why the other Democrats are reluctant to do the same.
   The Republican Party began to close ranks behind the certain
nomination of Bush in marked contrast to the disarray in the
Democratic Party. One sure sign of the inevitability of Bush's
nomination is Reagan edging closer to dropping his transparent veil
of neutrality.
   ``We could see the president involved in some political
activities before the nominating convention'' in August in New
Orleans, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said a decision ``has not been finally made, although
everyone is aware ... that the reality of the situation is such
that the vice president is very close to having the nomination.''
   The Democrats campaigned mainly in Wisconsin, with a primary on
Tuesday, and Gore and Michael Dukakis argued about Jackson's
qualifications to be president.
   Jackson was stung by Gore's contention that, among other things,
he lacks the experience necessary to be president. Campaigning
Wednesday night in Wisconsin, he told a crowd at a church in the
working-class city of Cudahy: ``Some leaders don't hold office. But
leaders stand with the people in the hour of hardship and
challenge.''
   Earlier, Jackson complained to reporters at Washington's
National Airport that Gore's remarks constituted an attack ``more
personal than principled.'' Gore, passing through the same airport
a short while later, took issue with that, and criticized Jackson
anew.
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' the Tennessee senator said. ``He's
a major contender for the White House. Is he to be immune from any
questioning of his position on the issues or his approach to the
campaign? ... Is there a separate standard?''
   Gore and Jackson had planned to meet Wednesday, but it fell
through. In light of Gore's comments a day earlier, Jackson said,
``It's not necessary to meet at this time.''
   On Tuesday in New York, Gore said Jackson had a ``complete and
total lack'' of qualifications for the nation's highest office and
criticized his foreign policy views.
   Gore ridiculed rival Dukakis, saying the Massachusetts
governor's hesitancy to spell out differences with Jackson was
``ludicrous.'' Dukakis, campaigning in Wisconsin Wednesday night,
replied: ``We can discuss issues without attacking each
other...(Voters) don't want to know what Gore thinks of Jackson.''
   Dukakis has been under pressure as a result of recent losses to
Jackson in Illinois and Michigan. But he managed to recoup with a
solid 2-1 victory in Tuesday's Connecticut primary.
   With that victory, the Massachusetts governor again took the
lead in the national delegate race. According to the latest AP
count, Dukakis had 648.55, Jackson 642.55, Gore 367.8 and Sen. Paul
Simon 169.5, with 488.6 uncommitted.
   Asked by reporters in Boston on Wednesday to detail the
differences between himself and Jackson, Dukakis answered
cautiously. He mentioned disagreements over Middle East policy and
some domestic economic matters, but provided no specifics, saying
he would discuss the matter more fully in a Wisconsin speech later
this week.
   Dukakis hinted that Jackson's lack of any experience in elective
office ought to be considered by voters. But he quickly moved to
stress that any disagreements he had with Jackson had always been
``friendly and respectful.''
   That attitude got Gore's dander up.
   ``Is there supposed to be some unwritten rule why Jesse Jackson
cannot be criticized, why his positions have to be just sacrosanct,
and nobody can say anything about them for fear somebody will just
misinterpret what you're saying?'' he said.
   Sen. Paul Simon, campaigning in Wisconsin, suggested that fear
of alienating fervent Jackson supporters was keeping other
candidates from engaging in any real rough-and-tumble with him.
   ``You have to be careful. You don't want to be perceived as
anti-black,'' the Illinois senator said. Jackson has been getting
nearly unanimous black support in primary states, according to exit
polls.
   A spokesman for Bush said if the vice president faced Jackson in
the general election, he would have ``no reluctance'' to criticize
him as warranted.
   ``If Jackson is the nominee, we will feel very willing to attack
him on the issues,'' Bush spokesman Pete Teeley said. ``There will
be no reticence, there will be no reluctance.''
   The vice president virtually locked up the GOP nomination when
his principal rival, Sen. Bob Dole, left the race Tuesday. Former
television evangelist Pat Robertson is still formally in the
running, but has acknowledged he's not likely to come from behind
at this point.
   Bush has 813 delegates, according to the latest AP count, to
Robertson's 17. To nominate, 1,139 delegates are needed.
   With little to do but stay out of trouble, Bush sought to steer
clear of Meese and his problems.
   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney
General William F. Weld quit Tuesday. Justice Department sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two left their jobs
because they were concerned that Meese's continuing legal
difficulties were damaging the effectiveness and credibility of the
department.
   Meese, however, said Wednesday he would not resign.
   Bush said he was troubled by the resignations but added, ``I'm
not going to pass judgment'' on whether Meese should go.
   Bush did say Meese would not hold the top law enforcement post
in a Bush administration. ``It seems to me that the Justice
Department has to be above reproach. It is an agency that has
special responsibility,'' he said.
   Republicans turned their attention to platform matters. The
party opened platform hearings Wednesday in Washington, focusing on
foreign policy. The next hearing is scheduled May 31 in Kansas
City, Mo., and another is set in Los Angeles on June 30.

   U.S. officials point proudly to how many Latin
American countries have become democratic in recent years, but on
the hemispheric issues of most concern to President Reagan _
Nicaragua and Panama _ it's hard to find one willing to align
itself with American policy.
   On Tuesday, a day when the administration was issuing veiled
warnings about the possibility of military intervention in Panama,
a regional conclave in Caracas, Venezuela, decided that the United
States had already gone too far in its campaign against military
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``We urge the U.S. government to revoke immediately the coercive
measures it has adopted against Panama,'' the Latin American
Economic System said in a communique after a two-day meeting.
Nations ranging from rightist Chile to Marxist Cuba signed the
declaration.
   The underlying message was clear: the 26 countries are worried
that the United States is setting a precedent in Panama that could
be used against any one of them in the future.
   This consideration far outweighs the distaste that many have for
Noriega, named in two federal narcotics indictments. They believe
they themselves might be an American target some day if they get
caught smuggling drugs to the United States or run afoul of U.S.
policy in some other way.
   Over the past month, the administration has contributed to
Panama's economic collapse through measures that have had the
effect of aggravating an acute cash shortage in Panama.
   It has, for example, taken steps to deny Noriega access to some
$50 million in official Panamanian funds deposited in U.S. banks
and has withheld a $6.5 million payment due to Panama for services
related to Panama Canal operations.
   But many in Congress, where opposition to Noriega is virtually
unanimous, believe the administration has not gone far enough. Some
advocate a comprehensive trade embargo.
   The administration has moved against Noriega in the name of
restoring democracy in Panama, but none of the democracies which
now dominate the hemisphere has seen fit to back the U.S. actions.
   The one source of comfort for the United States concerning
Panama is that the only nations that have provided overt support
for Noriega are Cuba and Nicaragua.
   Another frustration for the administration has been the
persistent refusal of Latin American nations to support the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Some countries, such as Mexico, have
fought U.S. policy since the beginning while many others finessed
the issue by refusing to take a stand.
   Asked for an explanation, U.S. officials say many nations have
expressed support for the Contras in private but refuse to do so
publicly.
   The reason, officials say, is that these countries fear a
left-wing backlash at home if they side with the United States. To
ensure domestic tranquility, disassociation from U.S. policy has
been a time-honored tactic.
   All this generates considerable hand-wringing among
administration officials. The United States was once routinely
accused of backing unpopular dictators against the wishes of their
subjects.
   But, particularly in the case of Panama, the United States has
not been able to count on Latin American support even when it takes
an assertive stand against a strongman like Noriega.
   A generation ago, it was relatively easy for the United States
to win diplomatic support in the hemisphere. With minimal
opposition, Washington orchestrated the diplomatic and economic
isolation of Cuba's revolutionary government and won Latin American
support, with some exceptions, for its armed intervention in the
Dominican Republic in 1965.
   The sole recent instance in which the United States and Latin
America have been in harmony was in 1979, when there was a common
effort to bring down the Somoza family dynasty in Nicaragua. The
Carter administration called on President Anastasio Somoza to step
down and, within a month, he was gone.

   Prostitutes are masquerading as
schoolgirls to lure clients wary of getting infected with AIDS, the
head of Uganda's task force on the disease said Thursday.
   Dr. Samuel Okware, the head of the National Committee for
Prevention of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndome, said his
organization had started a nationwide program to warn people of the
charade.
   Men are ``diverting their attention to schoolgirls and ignoring
bar maids and prostitutes'' because of their fear of catching the
sexually transmitted disease, he said.
   Prostitutes are donning school uniforms and carrying books
during the late afternoon when students normally return home from
school, Okware said.
   He said in the last three months, the practice had become common
among prostitutes in Masaka, about 85 miles southwest of Kampala,
the capital.
   There are 2,300 confirmed cases of AIDS in Uganda, said Okware.

<TEXT>
   The soap opera ``General Hospital''
celebrates its 25th anniversary on Friday showing no signs of ill
health in the Nielsen ratings, a recovery that began when it went
on location and added such contemporary anti-heroes as Luke and
Laura.
   The show, which began as a straightforward hospital drama on
April 1, 1963, was almost dead in the ratings when Gloria Monty
took over as executive producer in 1978, infusing the show with
contemporary plots and characters. Since 1979, it has been
consistently No. 1 in daytime.
   In 1981, the wedding of shady characters Luke and Laura
attracted an audience of nearly 17 million people _ in prime time,
the equivalent might be a combination of a Super Bowl and the ``Who
Shot J.R.?'' episode of ``Dallas.''
   The show was so popular, even Elizabeth Taylor did a guest shot.
A popular song was inspired _ ``General Hospi-tale.''
   For the first quarter of 1988, ``General Hospital'' tied with
CBS' ``The Young and the Restless'' for first place in the daytime
Nielsens, with an average rating of 8.6 and 27 share. The rating is
a percentage of 88.6 million U.S. households with televisions. The
share is a percentage of the sets in use.
   John Beradino, as Dr. Steve Harvey, and Emily McLaughlin, as
nurse Jessie Brewer, have been with the show since it began. Rachel
Ames, who joined the next year as Audrey Hardy, also still appears.
   Under Monty's guidance the show was expanded to an hour and took
on action-oriented storylines that turned it into a pop phenomenon.
   ``General Hospital'' was one of the first daytime dramas to go
on location, shorten scenes to quicken the pacing and introduce
more contemporary characters.
   Wes Kenney, who had produced CBS' ``The Young and the Restless''
and NBC's ``Days of Our Lives,'' took over as executive producer
when Monty left a year ago.
   ```General Hospital' is an adventure-driven show that also
depends heavily on its characters,'' said Kenney. ``Lots of shows
rely on character and romance, but what Gloria introduced was
adventure and suspense, which no soap had ever done before. Another
thing Gloria introduced was remotes (location shooting). Last year
we did more than 17. We got to Nashville, Niagara Falls and Mount
Rushmore. We blew up a whole mountain in Pacific Palisades. We had
a snow storm at Big Bear.
   ``There's a tendency for all soaps to go on location, but I
think `General Hospital' has carried it out more successfully. We
use the remotes to push the story ahead rather than just as an
excuse to get out of the studio.''
   Since the departure of actors Anthony Geary and Genie Francis as
Luke Spencer and Laura Baldwin, no one has heated up the airwaves
the way they did. Luke and Laura were a departure from the good vs.
evil staple of daytime drama. They became magazine-cover heroes,
even though Laura once killed off an old boyfriend, and when she
was raped, the culprit turned out to be Luke.
   Among characters who now populate ``General Hospital'' are:
   _ The menage a trois of Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers), Anna
Devane (Finola Hughes), and Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan). Scorpio and
Anna were once married and had a child, but Scorpio later married
Holly (Emma Samms, before she went to ``Dynasty''). Anna and Duke
are now married, but there is a continuing competition for Anna by
the two men.
   _ Bobbie Spencer Meyer (Jackie Zeman) and Scott Baldwin (Kin
Shriner). Troublemaker Scott has just returned to the show and
renewed his relationship with Bobbie.
   _ Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) and her husband Tony Jones (Brad
Maule). Lucy, who had been an in-house villain, has turned around
with her marriage to surgeon Tony Jones. Some people still don't
like her, but her marriage gives her respect.
   _ Felicia Jones (Kristina Malandro) has not had a relationship
since the departure of Frisco (Jack Wagner) a year ago. Frisco is
supposedly away on a spy mission, but now that it appears Wagner
will not return, the writers will involve her in another
relationship. Her new story will center on her search for Frisco.
   _ Tom Hardy (David Wallace) has returned to the show and married

   ``I think people like stories that continue so they can relate

   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart
reportedly said preacher Oral Roberts freed him of ``demons with
long fingernails'' digging into his body before Swaggart decided to
defy his church and return to the pulpit.
   Swaggart, accused of motel trysts with a prostitute, intends to
return to the pulpit May 22, three months after stepping down,Bill
Treeby, his lawyer and a board member of Jimmy Swaggart World
Ministries, said Wednesday.
   Swaggart said several weeks ago that he has undergone extensive
prayer and counseling with Roberts, the Rev. Mike Evans of Euless,
Texas, Swaggart's friend and a fellow TV evangelist, said in a
television interview Wednesday.
   ``And he said to me that Oral Roberts called him up and told him
that he saw demons with long fingernails digging their flesh into
Jimmy Swaggart's body and that he cast those demon spirits out of
Jimmy Swaggart,'' Evans said.
   Evans told Dallas television station WFAA he did not know
whether Roberts' counseling led to Swaggart's plans to resume
preaching May 22, but said that Swaggart feels the process has
freed him of his sin.
   ``I am proud to confirm that,'' Oral Roberts' son, Richard, told
the television station.
   Gus Weill, a spokesman for Swaggart, said today that Roberts had
spoken to the evangelist only once.
   ``Rev. Oral Roberts is one of hundreds and hundreds of ministers
who have called Rev. Swaggart to pray with him and he deeply
appreciates those calls,'' Weill said. ``He spoke to Rev. Roberts
about four weeks ago and that was the only time he called him.''
   Swaggart's return May 22 coincides with the end of a three-month
suspension by the church's Louisiana council. The national church's
General Presbytery on Tuesday overruled that term as too lenient
and barred him from the pulpit for at least a year and ordered him
to undergo two years of rehabilitation and counseling.
   Treeby said there was a conflict within the Assemblies, the
nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, over whether the
national presbytery or the Louisiana council has the right to
discipline ministers.
   ``He is willing to submit himself to the Louisiana District,''
Treeby told a televised news conference at Swaggart's headquarters
here. ``He will be considering an appeal to the national
Presbytery.''
   However, Juleen Turnage, a spokeswoman for the national office
of the Assemblies in Springfield, Mo., said Swaggart's option to
return after three months ``does not exist anymore.''
   ``The General Presbytery overwhelmingly and without a dissenting
vote affirmed the authority of the Executive Presbytery to make
decisions on matters concerning ministerial credentials,'' she said
Wednesday.
   The 13-member Executive Presbytery acts as the church's board of
directors, while the 232-member General Presbytery is its oversight
body.
   The Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, the Assemblies' general
superintendent, said Tuesday that if Swaggart did not accept its
ruling, ``the Executive Presbytery would no doubt take action to
dismiss him.''
   Church officials originally said Swaggart had 30 days to appeal
the terms of his rehabilitation. However, Mrs. Turnage said
Wednesday church bylaws provide for an appeal only in cases of
dismissal, not suspension.
   Asked if a year away from the pulpit would ruin Swaggart's
lucrative ministry, Treeby said, ``He is weighing all those
considerations very carefully.''
   The ministry has said it took in $150 million in 1986 from its
worldwide operations, including sales. It contributes an estimated
$12 million a year to the Assemblies' foreign missions program.
   Louisiana Assemblies officials have close ties to Swaggart's
church, television and Bible school enterprise. Cecil Janway,
superintendent of the Louisiana district, also sits on the board of
Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.
   Although the Executive Presbytery interrupted its regular
bimonthly meeting to watch Treeby's news conference, ``We don't
consider that we've heard from Jimmy Swaggart, because we don't
communicate through television news conferences with our
disciplined ministers,'' Mrs. Turnage said.
   Swaggart tearfully stepped down from the pulpit on Feb. 21 after
confessing an unspecified sin. Church officials later said they had
seen photographs of the evangelist with a prostitute in a motel
room.
   According to the Presbytery's terms of rehabilitation, Swaggart
must stop preaching and distributing videotaped sermons for at
least one year, and undergo counseling and supervision by church
elders for two years.
   Swaggart is the latest evangelist to be forced from the pulpit.
His accuser, Marvin Gorman, was forced from the Assemblies of God
when he admitted to an immoral act with a woman. Jim and Tammy
Bakker were forced from their PTL ministry in a scandal that
included a sexual encounter between Bakker and former church
secretary Jessica Hahn.

   A house painter who was stabbed when
he tried to help a woman he thought was being raped has received
gifts of food and money and offers of a job.
   Tom Botsford, 27, has also gotten phone calls offering him
encouragement and a check, accompanied by a short letter that said,
``You qualify to get to heaven.''
   Most importantly, Botsford said, the admirers have rebuilt his
morale.
   Botsford was stabbed March 5 after he tried to break up a
dispute between a man and woman outside his apartment building.
   Botsford, who said he thought the woman was being raped, was
stabbed by the man three times. Authorities said there was not
enough evidence to charge Botsford's attacker.
   Botsford has no insurance to cover his medical bills, and his
pregnant wife, Cecelia, is not working. He is not eligible for
unemployment benefits.
   Almost four weeks after he was stabbed in his shoulder and
abdomen, Botsford still groans with pain when he pushes himself up
from the couch.
   But since his story appeared March 15 in The Fort Collins
Coloradoan, Botsford's wounds _ and his pride _ have started to
heal.
   Admirers have sent $170, and one man offered him a sales job.
Another note said, ``Give me a ring if you can't get a job.''
   An anonymous writer said, ``I appreciate your efforts to help. I
hope someone like you is around if one of my daughters are ever in
trouble.''

   Two prosecutors involved in a high-speed
chase have resigned in the wake of accusations that the driver was
semi-nude and tried to intimidate officers who stopped her.
   Assistant State Attorney Janine A. Bamping, 32, was stopped
March 20 and cited for allegedly fleeing and attempting to elude
police in a chase through Bradenton Beach.
   Her passenger, Assistant State Attorney Jerome B. Blevins, 27,
wasn't charged.
   Police said they didn't ask Ms. Bamping to get out of the car
for a sobriety test because she was undressed from the waist down.
Belvins was fully clothed, officers said.
   When asked while she was only partially clothed, she became
angry, flashed her state prosecutor's badge and used the name of a
county judge suggesting retribution against them, the officers said.
   Ms. Bamping was suspended with pay last week while State
Attorney Frank Schaub was on vacation. Schaub met with the
assistants Monday and accepted their resignations Wednesday.
   ``Both are competent prosecutors and their work will be
missed,'' Schaub said in a statement. He said he has asked the
governor's office to assign an outside state attorney to review the
charges, which Ms. Bamping apparently intends to fight.
   Schaub heads a staff of 46 assistants in the 12th Judicial
Circuit of three counties.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Government Will Repatriate Remains of 27 Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vietnamese government has informed the
United States it will repatriate the remains of what it believes
may be 27 American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, the
Pentagon said today.
   The remains will be delivered to U.S. military officials in
Hanoi on April 6 and transported to the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Honolulu for identification, the
Pentagon said in a statement.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the initiative taken by
Vietnam to repatriate these remains and hopes it represents just
one of many continued steps to resolve this long-standing
humanitarian issue,'' the Pentagon said.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said the
repatriation would be the largest single such transfer of remains
since the end of the war. The largest previous tranfer occurred on
Aug. 14, 1985, when the Vietnamese returned 26 remains.
   There are currently 2,404 Americans still listed as missing in
Indochina as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,767 are listed
as missing in either North or South Vietnam. The remains of 152
Americans have been repatriated to the United States and
subsequently identified by the laboratory since the end of the war.
   On March 2, the Vietnamese turned over 17 remains to U.S.
officials. Those remains have yet to be identified, however.
   The upcoming transfer would be the fourth since retired Army
Gen. John Vessey traveled to Hanoi last August as a special
presidential emissary, hoping to step up the process of accounting
for missing Americans.
   ``We've continued to press the Vietnamese and we are getting
some results,'' Howard said today.
   Asked if the Pentagon could explain the sudden increase in
repatriations, Howard replied: ``It's really not for us to do that.
The Vietnamese are the ones who should be explaining to the
American people and to the world what happened to the rest of the
remains and where they are.''
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said the
Vietnamese government notified U.S. officials during technical
meetings in mid-March that they were investigating 29 new reports
of remains being found or information regarding servicemen
uncovered.
   Earlier this week, the Vietnamese informed the United States it
did have 27 remains to repatriate, Schneider said.

   Rumbling spring thunderstorms have announced the
beginning of the unofficial tornado season that runs from April
through June across Texas and other Tornado Alley states in the
nation's heartland.
   From 1951 through 1986, there have been an average of 118
tornadoes in Texas per year, according to the state climatologist's
office in College Station.
   More than 60 percent of those occur between April and June,
records show. In April and June an average of 18 to 19 tornadoes
occur each month, but in May, when weather conditions are the most
unstable, that average increases to about 36.
   A few twisters were already recorded in early March in Texas but
they did little or no damage. A tornado that touched down Tuesday
in central Louisiana, near Bunkie, destroyed two brick homes.
   ``People should have plans of what they'll do in tornadoes. If
they wait until it gets there, it's going to be too late,'' said
Buddy McIntyre, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.
   Last May 22, a killer storm flattened the small West Texas town
of Saragosa, killing 30 people and injuring 162. In mid-November,
11 people died in East Texas when a series of tornadoes trashed
towns from Cherokee County to the Gulf Coast.
   ``A tornado is such a devastating kind of storm. No matter how
much preparation you do there is some property damage and some loss
of life. But there are some things you can do to protect yourself
and property,'' said Laureen Chernow, a spokeswoman for the
governor's division of emergency management.
   One is to know the difference between the tornado watches and
tornado warnings issued by the weather service.
   A watch means weather conditions are suitable for development of
a tornado, and people should keep a careful lookout for potential
funnel clouds.
   A tornado warning means one has already developed and has been
spotted. Take cover immediately and don't go outside, but if you
are in a car or mobile home you will be safer taking cover in the
nearest ditch or depression.
   At home, the best place to stay is a basement or underground
storm shelter. If no such shelter is available, go inside a closet
in the center of the house or bathroom or lie flat under a heavy
table.
   McIntyre noted that most fatalities in a tornado are from flying
debris, so ``we tell people to squat down, cover their heads and
present a low profile.''
   James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for Disaster
Research at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly try
to outrun tornadoes in their cars.
   During the 1979 Wichita Falls tornado that killed 53, McDonald
said, ``people jumped in their cars and drove down Main Street at
90 mph.'' Twenty-six people died while trying to outrun the twister.
   Another misconception is about opening windows. It was once
believed that windows needed to be open to equalize air pressure
between the storm and the inside of a house to prevent the house
from exploding.
   McIntyre said there are enough natural openings in a house to
equalize air pressure, and ``if that tornado wants to open your
windows, it'll do that for you.''

   The White House today hailed the advancement
of a new arms treaty in the Senate and said there is a good
possibility it will be ratified by the time President Reagan visits
Moscow for summit talks.
   Democratic vote-counters said the Senate will easily approve the
U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons,
despite Republican complaints over an amendment limiting future
presidential interpretations of the agreement.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., No. 2 in the Democratic
leadership, said his counts show no more than five of the 100
senators are likely to vote against the pact. Ratification requires
approval of 67 senators.
   ``I think there will be hurdles, but I don't expect it to be
turned down,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee.
   Both Pell and Cranston offered their assessments shortly after
the Foreign Relations Committee endorsed the pact Wednesday on a
17-2 vote that included the support of 10 Democrats and seven
Republicans. Only Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Larry Pressler,
R-S.D., voted against the treaty.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
it was ``a very good action. ... We're hopeful for good, strong
floor debate and passage as soon as possible.
   ``We certainly would like to have the treaty ratified before we
go to Moscow for the summit and it looks like that's a good
possibility,'' Fitzwater said. Reagan will arrive in Moscow on May
29 and remain there until June 2.
   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, requires both sides to destroy all
nuclear-armed missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   Among the weapons that will destroyed are the Soviet force of
650 SS-20s and other medium-range weapons aimed at western European
targets. The United States will give up Pershing II missiles
stationed in West Germany and ground-launched cruise missiles
stationed in five NATO nations.
   The pact is the first in the history of arms control to require
the actual destruction of the missiles that carry nuclear warheads.
It is also the first to require on-site inspection to verify
compliance.
   ``For the first time since Hiroshima, you see the number of
weapons going down,'' said Pell.
   The treaty will probably come to the Senate floor by late April
and when it does, Pell said, the most contentious issue will be the
Democratic-backed amendment.
   The amendment says that a future president cannot change the
U.S. intepretation of the treaty without congressional approval.
   The fight stems from Reagan's assertion that he can unilaterally
change the interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, a view challenged by congressional Democrats.
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., a supporter of the pact, called
the amendment ``a great mistake'' and said, ``it very frankly may
change my position in response to the treaty'' on the floor.
   Pressler predicted the amendment ``will lead to the defeat of
this treaty entirely because (with it), the votes aren't there.''
   The Foreign Relations vote was the third overwhelming
endorsement given the pact by a Senate committee. The Intelligence
Committee unanimously approved it and the Armed Services Committee
voted in favor by an 18-2 margin.
   The Armed Services Committee did express some concerns, and
Maynard Glitman, chief U.S. negotiator, tried to answer those fears
Wednesday in testimony before the Foreign Relations panel.
   Glitman said ``futuristic'' weapons such as lasers and particle
beam generators are banned by the treaty if they are carried on
``weapons delivery vehicles'' within the prohibited range.
   The Soviets ``understand that all future (weapons) systems
falling within the criteria will be banned,'' he told Helms.
   And if an unarmed medium-range missile were to strike and
destroy a target through impact alone, it would be considered a
weapon if it had been designed for that purpose, he said.
   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Armed Services chairman, said he
didn't think Glitman's comments had settled the issue. Nunn said he
would seek a more definitive clarification during Senate debate.
   Nunn said he might seek an amendment to the treaty requiring the
administration to obtain a specific statement from the Soviets
acknowledging that they had agreed not to produce, deploy or flight
test futuristic medium-range weapons.

<TEXT>
   New postal rates taking effect Sunday complete
a complex process that got under way 11 months ago.
   While most of the attention on the new 25-cent stamp has
occurred in the last few weeks, the rate was actually proposed by
the U.S. Postal Service in May 1987.
   Since then, there has been so much discussion that some
consumers may be confused about how many times rates have risen,
said John Griesemer, chairman of the Board of Governors of the
Postal Service.
   When it was made an independent federal agency in the early
1970s, the U.S. Postal Service was directed to break even by
raising rates to cover costs. The taxpayer subsidy that had been
provided to the old Post Office was gradually eliminated.
   But to prevent sudden, sharp rate hikes, a separate Postal Rate
Commission was set up to monitor mailing costs.
   Under the law, the Postal Service balances its funds over a term
of years. When losses accumulate it raises rates. Subsequently it
may show a surplus for some years, until costs rise to push it back
into the red and again result in another hike.
   The Postal Service lost $223 million in fiscal 1987, and the red
ink was expected to increase this year despite cost-cutting efforts.
   The agency had a $305 million surplus in 1986, following sharp
cost-cutting in the wake of 1985's loss of $251 million, agency
managers reported.
   Surpluses were reported in 1984, 1983 and 1982, following rate
increases in 1981.
   After the Postal Service's Board of Governors proposed new rates
last May, the case went to the Postal Rate Commission, which is
charged with listening to all interested persons and recommending
whether the new rates should take effect.
   The commission has 10 months to reach a decision, which then
goes back to the postal Board of Governors.
   The commission issued its ruling March 4, three days early. That
decision on a rate hike, which was close to the original request,
was then ordered into effect by the postal governors.

   Americans are paying more to laugh
less. But don't worry, the presidential election campaign should
produce some cheap chuckles.
   The 1988 Cost of Laughing Index, released to coincide with April
Fool's Day and adjusted for inflation, showed a 5.8 percent
increase in the humor scale over last year.
   The annual index, which measures 18 leading humor indicators,
compares the punch line to the bottom line. It showed the wholesale
price of rubber chickens increased $4.80 per dozen during the past
12 months.
   ``The trend in playful poultry is particularly worrisome,'' said
Malcolm Kushner, a self-described humor consultant who compiled the
index. ``Over the past two years, rubber chickens prices have
jumped 23 percent and dancing chicken telegrams have risen by 9
percent.
   ``Funny fowl may soon become a memory for most American
consumers.''
   Other increases included an 8 percent hike in comedy club ticket
prices and an 11 percent jump in the newstand price of Mad
Magazine. On the up side, the wholesale price of Groucho glasses
and arrow-through-the-head gags did not change.
   Former attorney Kushner, whose consulting operation is based in
Santa Cruz, also gives seminars on how to use humor to communicate.
His clients include IBM, Lockheed and the notoriously funny IRS.

<TEXT>
   A man trying to return a neighbor's
escaped pet wound up like an amateur facing pro wrestlers Hulk
Hogan or Andre the Giant _ he was pinned on the first fall by a
700-pound wrestling bear.
   Harry Dodge, a retired Cleveland Heights animal warden, opened
his door Wednesday when he heard a noise on his porch and spotted
his neighbor's trained and declawed black bear, Smoky.
   He realized Smoky apparently had broken out of his cage and took
some apples to lure him back home.
   The 7-foot-tall bear just tripped him and sat on him.
   ``The bear thought it was a wrestling match,'' said Lorain
County Deputy Sheriff Gary Abicht.
   The bear performs under the stage name Caesar at taverns or
social events and wrestles with anyone who thinks they can beat him.
   When authorities tried to remove Smoky from Dodge's yard in this
Cleveland suburb, the bear wouldn't even budge for four Lorain
County deputies, three or four policemen from Strongsville and two
officers from Olmsted Falls. So they tied him to a tree with a rope
until they located Smoky's owner, Salvatore Mazzola.
   Then, ``they gave him some peanut butter or something and lured
him into a trailer'' used to transport him, Abicht said.
   Abicht said Mazzola quarreled with a game warden at the scene
and was charged with obstructing official business. He was freed on
$1,500 bond.
   State Game Protector Tom Harrod said Thursday he was preparing
additional charges against Mazzola for not having state licenses
for Smoky and a bear cub named Magnum, or for a raccoon that lives
in Mazzola's house.
   Harrod said he put the animals in the custody of another animal
handler until Mazzola gets the permits.
   Dodge was treated at Southwest General Hospital for back and
neck strain.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1709 Stradivarius violin named in honor of
English concert musician Marie Hall was sold Thursday for $889,240,
the highest auction price ever paid for a musical instrument.
   The violin, acquired by Miss Hall in 1905, was bought by an
unidentified South American dealer, Sotheby's reported. The dealer
beat out two other foreign rivals bidding by telephone in a tense,
two-minute auction.
   The previous highest auction price for a violin by Italian
craftsman Antonio Stradivari was $728,000. ``The Colossus,'' dated
1716, was bought last year by Italian violinist Luigi Alberto
Bianchi.
   The Guinness Book of Records says the highest known price for a
Stradivarius is $1.2 million, but that was in a private sale of
Stradivari's ``Alard'' violin by British dealers W.E. Hill and Sons
to a Singapore dealer.
   Bidding started Thursday at $470,000, said Sotheby's spokeswoman
Beth McHattie said.
   Marie Hall, considered one of the finest violinists of her era,
died at age 72 in 1956. British composer Vaughan Williams dedicated
his ``The Lark Ascending'' to her, and she first performed it on
her Stradivarius in 1920.
   Miss Hall bequeathed the violin, previously known as the
``Viotti'' after Giovanni Battista Viotti, to her daughter.
   The owner who sold it on Thursday was not identified.
   The instrument was last auctioned in 1968, when it sold for
$52,600 _ a record at the time.
   Thursday's auction ``was quite drawn out and tense and there was
a round of applause at the end,'' said Ms. McHattie. ``We're
absolutely delighted to be the record holders again.''
   The violin, kept in very good condition, had been expected to
fetch up to $846,000, she said. It has a distinctive tiger-stripe
wood grain pattern and is varnished in a rich orange-brown color.
   About 700 of 1,116 violins by Stradivari have survived.

<HEAD>Bush Focuses on General Election Amid Talk of James Baker Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, his grip now firm
on the Republican presidential nomination, is shifting his focus to
the fall election amid speculation that Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III will resign to oversee his campaign.
   Reagan administration sources suggested that Baker, a longtime
Bush ally, likely would not make such a move before the GOP
convention in New Orleans Aug. 15-18, despite the withdrawal this
week of Sen. Bob Dole.
   Dole's exit from the race, virtually guaranteeing Bush will be
the GOP candidate, heightened expectations that Baker might speed
up a decision to join the Bush team.
   But a Treasury Department official, commenting only on condition
of anonymity, said on Thursday there was no truth to suggestions
that Baker might resign as early as August 1. The official would
not elaborate.
   Baker intends to participate in the seven-nation economic summit
in Toronto in late June, administration officials said.
   Meanwhile, President Reagan may begin campaigning for Bush even
before the party convention, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. The
White House had previously said that Reagan would remain neutral
until the convention.
   Fitzwater said that policy is being reconsidered ``in view of
the way the campaign has developed, and in view of the vice
president's now seemingly assured nomination.''
   Baker has longstanding ties to Bush and managed his 1980
presidential bid. He also was chairman of President Ford's 1976
camaign and senior adviser to the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign.
   Peter Teeley, a Bush campaign spokesman, said a discussion of
what role Baker might play in the Bush campaign, if any, was only
speculative at this time.
   However, Teeley added, ``Jim is very close to the vice president
and has been for a quarter of a century. There's no secret what
their relationship has been.''
   Baker could probably have any job in a Bush presidency that he
wanted, and there have been rumors for some time that he would like
to be secretary of state rather than continue on as treasury
secretary _ even though he has built an international reputation in
his current post and appears to enjoy the job.
   Bush on Wednesday told reporters he intended to ``have a new
Cabinet'' if elected. The answer responded specifically to a query
on embattled Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III but might also be taken as
a signal that there would be a new treasury secretary in a Bush
presidency.
   Baker became treasury secretary in 1985 after four years as
Reagan's chief of staff.
   Bush was back in Washington Thursday after a three-day swing
through Wisconsin. He scaled back campaign stops in that state,
which holds its primary election next Tuesday, after Dole's
withdrawal.
   Reagan had his regular weekly lunch with Bush on Thursday, but
Fitzwater said he did not know if campaign plans were discussed.
   The president's spokesman said a decision on any presidential
campaign activity in Bush's behalf before the convention ``has not
been finally made, although ... the vice president is very close to
having the nomination.''
   ``Pat Robertson is still a candidate, in a declared sense, but
he too recognizes the realities of the situation,'' Fitzwater said.
   The vice president called his new status, without a major GOP
rival, ``exhilarating,'' and campaign aides made use of the time in
Washington to plot future strategy _ including ways to keep
attention focused on Bush now that the nomination appears sewn up.
   ``It does take us out of the spotlight,'' spokesman Teeley
acknowledged. ``But he is the vice president. He will be the
nominee of the party. And he will be able to generate news.''
   For now, Bush is continuing with plans for campaign appearances
in states that have upcoming primaries and that will also be
important in the general election _ including New York, New Jersey,
Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   He is also planning fund-raising trips late next week to Texas
and Florida, states where he has already won primaries.
   While running on the record of the eight-year Reagan-Bush
administration, Bush has also been seeking to develop and flesh out
his own themes, including a heavy emphasis on educational issues.
   ``George Bush's job now is to solidify the Republican Party. He
can develop themes now for the Republicans in November. That's
something the Democrats can't do,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., who traveled with the vice president in Wisconsin this week.
   And, jokes Bush, ``It's important for a vice president not to
upstage his boss. And you don't know how hard it's been for me to
keep my charisma in check for the past seven years.''

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Kunce pleading innocent and
ADD details on child neglect charges and Stevens' death; picks up
7th graf pvs, ``Stevens' withered ... ''</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GALESBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who concealed her husband's death
for eight years and tended the corpse as if it were alive pleaded
guilty today to a felony forgery charge stemming from the death.
   But a former Chicago-area dentist accused of assisting her in
the forgery pleaded innocent and a jury trial was ordered.
   Carole Stevens, 42, entered her plea today in Knox County
Circuit Court before Associate Judge Harry Bulkeley.
   Mrs. Stevens was sentenced to two years probation and 12 days in
the county jail, for which she received credit for 12 days already
served. Officials said Mrs. Stevens still faces a hearing on child
neglect charges involving her two children, who are in foster care.
   Besides probation, Bulkeley ordered Mrs. Stevens to undergo a
psychiatric examination and told her to have no further contact
with her alleged partner in the deception, Richard G. Kunce, 56, a
former Aurora dentist.
   Kunce, in a brief appearance today before Judge Stephen Mathers,
pleaded innocent and left the courtroom. He still awaits a court
appearance on a felony charge of cruelty to children.
   In February, Mrs. Stevens and Kunce both pleaded guilty in Knox
County Court to misdemeanor charges of failing to report the May
1979 death of Carl L. Stevens, a diabetic who authorities say died
shortly after he joined a holistic health cult and stopped taking
his daily insulin shots.
   Steven's withered corpse was found Jan. 29 on a bed in the home,
where officials said his widow had cared for the body daily over
the past eight years, changing its clothes and moving it from room
to room.
   Following their guilty pleas on the misdemeanor charges, both
Mrs. Stevens and Kunce also faced felony forgery charges.
   Mrs. Stevens was accused of fabricating a power of attorney for
her dead husband in 1984. Kunce, who was a guest in the Stevens
house the past year, was charged with forgery for signing his name
to the document as a witness.
   Last week, Kunce asked a judge to withdraw his guilty plea on
the charge of failure to report Stevens' death. The hearing on
Kunce's request was postponed until late April.

<HEAD>One Year After Nuke Shutdown, Plant Appeals Directly To Public</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the year since Peach Bottom became the
first nuclear plant shut down because workers slept on the job,
shareholders have absorbed $72 million in replacement energy costs,
its operator said Thursday.
   Philadelphia Electric Co. said in a blunt ``open letter'' to
civic and governmental organizations in southeastern Pennsylvania
and northern Maryland that the episode has been ``an embarassment''
and that the plant would not restart until the company is
``completely satisfied'' conditions had changed.
   On March 31, 1987, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered
Peach Bottom closed indefinitely, citing a pattern of control room
operators dozing on duty and saying continued operation posed ``an
immediate threat to health and safety.''
   ``To date, the shutdown has caused the company's shareholders to
absorb approximately $72 million of higher replacement energy
costs, while the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission has ordered
PE customers' rates to be reduced by $30.4 million per year until
restart,'' PE said in the letter.
   ``There is no question that the public confidence has been
shaken as the result of this shutdown and this is the type of
communication with the public that will begin to rebuild that,'' PE
spokesman Neil McDermott said.
   The letter was signed by PE President and Chief Operating
Officer Joseph Paquette, who took over three weeks ago, after James
Everett III resigned in the face of mounting criticism over Peach
Bottom's restart.
   Paquette blamed problems at Peach Bottom in part on a lack of
leadership by senior managers and a stagnant ``culture'' at the
plant that was devoid of individual accountability and open
communication.
   Since the shutdown, PE has proposed reorganizing work crews,
removed all supervisors who were at the plant one year ago, hired a
former Navy rear admiral as plant manager, instituted a new
training program for operators, and fired four employees and
suspended seven others for drug-related activities. Most of the
drug problems were said to be with maintenance workers.
   PE officials hope Peach Bottom, near the Maryland border, will
be restarted this fall. But officials must first apply to the NRC
regional office, and the regional office would inform the NRC in
Washington when it was convinced the plant was ready.

   Michael J. Fox says he's pulled out of the fast
lane to enjoy a quieter life with actress Tracy Pollan, US magazine
reports in its April 18 issue.
   ``I definitely feel real settling going on _ almost on every
level,'' said Fox. ``In my personal life, I'm just calming down and
really enjoying building a life outside work. ... And on the work
level, I'm not freaking out about things.''
   Fox denied reports that he'll marry in May; but he and Pollan
have bought a Vermont homestead together, US reported.
   The two became friends while playing a couple on television's
``Family Ties.''
   ``I was goofing around at that point in my life. I was a little
more prone to stay out late and drive fast and work hard,'' said
Fox. ``I hope I wasn't a jerk. But if I was, I have a sneaking
suspicion not many people were going to tell me I was.''
   One of the exceptions, he said, was Pollan. ``We got along
really well, but if I was a jerk, she just went, `That was a really
particularly stupid thing to do.' And I just went, `Wow! That's
great!'''
   After Pollan left the show for other projects, the romance
developed.
   The result, he said, ``is something I never, ever, in my wildest
dreams thought would come to pass.''

   Michael Jackson, whose ``Bad'' album
failed to win any Grammys last month, was a big winner in the
second annual Soul Train Music Awards.
   Jackson was honored for 1987 male vocalist album of the year and
the title song was named best single by a male vocalist Wednesday.
   In the female vocalist category, Whitney Houston won best album
for ``Whitney,'' and Natalie Cole took the best single award for
``I Live for Your Love.''
   Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson's sister, won the best music
video award for ``Control.''
   Levert won best group jazz album for ``The Big Throwdown'' and
best group single for ``Cassanova.''
   Another double winner was LL Cool J, whose ``I Need Love'' won
best rap single, and ``Bigger & Deffer'' was named best rap album.
   The night's biggest loser was Jody Watley, last month's best new
artist Grammy winner. She had tied Michael Jackson for most
nominations with three, including best female single and album and
best video, but came up empty-handed.

   P0NTIAC, Mich. (AP) _ John Z. De Lorean is suing his tax
attorney, saying he lost a $700,000 refund because the lawyer
missed a filing deadline.
   The 63-year-old former auto executive said in a lawsuit filed
Wednesday in Oakland County Circuit Court that he was entitled to
$700,127 for overpayment of his 1982 federal income taxes, but tax
attorney Frank C. Shaler missed the April 15, 1986, deadline.
   ``It's a friendly lawsuit,'' De Lorean said by telephone from
his home in Bedminster, N.J. ``It was a slip-up on Frank's part,
and he reported it to his insurance company. It was something he
just missed on the statute of limitations. He was the one who told
me about it.''
   ``He's still my accountant. He's a real sweet guy.''
   Shaler declined comment.
   De Lorean, whose Northern Ireland-based sports car company
collapsed in 1982, said he is preparing to get back into the auto
business with plans to build a new, ``exotic'' sports car in West
Germany. In 1984, he was acquitted of federal charges of selling
cocaine.

<TEXT>
   A woman running for Congress says she's
been barred from an annual stag dinner that has become a regular
campaign event and which her opponent and several other candidates
are likely to attend.
   ``This isn't just a woman trying to get tickets,'' Marianne
Brewster said Wednesday. ``This is a candidate for the House of
Representatives.''
   Brewster, a Republican running in the 4th District race, said
she won't try to gain admission to the Forty & Eight Lasociete's
oyster dinner April 8 at Mount View High School.
   ``I do plan to stand outside and shake hands and do it that
way,'' said Brewster, a Bluefield businesswoman. ``I don't want to
cause problems, but it's difficult to have to combat this.''
   Frank Pisano, a member of Forty & Eight, an offshoot of the
American Legion, said he expects up to 1,200 people to attend the
dinner. Dozens of local, state and national office seekers
typically attend.
   U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, a Democrat seeking re-election to the 4th
District seat, previously has attended and he and several
candidates for high state office plan to attend this year, Pisano
said.
   Throughout its quarter-century history, the $15-a-head dinner
has been off limits to women, he said.
   ``The policy that we've had is that it's a stag affair,'' Pisano
said. ``I don't have the authority to say we can open it up to
these other people.''

   Former presidential aide Lyn Nofziger should
be imprisoned because he showed a ``total lack of remorse'' when
convicted of illegally lobbying the White House, independent
counsel James C. McKay said today in court papers.
   McKay recommended that Nofziger receive a prison term for three
counts of violating the Ethics in Government Act to ``impress
present and former government employees, as well as the general
public that Congress intended those restrictions be taken seriously
and that they will be enforced with meaningful penalties.''
   The prosecutor noted that Nofziger, 63, former White House
political director, likened his crime to ``running a stop sign''
following his conviction Feb. 11 on three counts of illegal
lobbying his former agency within a year of leaving government.
   ``Since being found guilty, defendant Nofziger has made a number
of remarks showing a total lack of remorse or contrition for his
offenses,'' McKay said in a sentencing memo to U.S. District Judge
Thomas Flannery.
   ``That intransigent attitude is a consideration arguing in favor
of a sentence that includes a period of incarceration,'' McKay said.
   As further evidence of Nofziger's lack of contrition, McKay
quoted a Feb. 18 letter to the court in which Nofziger wrote: ``I
have never thought, and I do not think today, that I am guilty
morally, ethically or legally of the crimes of which I am
convicted.''
   Nofziger is scheduled to be sentenced April 8 and could receive
two-year prison terms and a $10,000 fine for each of the three
convictions of illegally lobbying on behalf of Wedtech Corp., a
maritime engineers union and the manufacturer of the Air Force A-10
anti-tank plane.
   In addition to an unspecified prison term, McKay recommended
``that an appropriate fine be imposed for each violation and that
the fines be imposed cumulatively for the three violations.''
   ``Nofziger's special entree to the most powerful officials in
government, including the president himself, epitomized the very
danger to public perception about the integrity of governmental
decision-making that motivated Congress to enact the one-year
no-contact prohibition,'' McKay said.
   McKay also dismissed Nofziger's argument that he misunderstood
the ethics law, saying he had received a White House manual that
instructed all members of President Reagan's staff to review
carefully the rules on post-employment lobbying.
   In addition, Nofziger received extensive legal advice from a
private law firm about the law, McKay said.
   The sentencing memo referred to an incident in which Nofziger
allegedly uttered a profanity when told by one of his lawyers not
to make any White House contacts ``without first clearing it with
his lawyers.''
   During a bench conference out of hearing of jurors and the
public, Associate Independent Counsel Merrick Garland told the
judge that after responding with a profanity, Nofziger said ``these
are my friends and I am going back to them if I want to'',
according to the memo.
   McKay noted that ``defense counsel has attempted to minimize the
significance of this episode by asserting that defendant Nofziger's
profanity in response to his lawyer's advice was characteristic of
their client's jocularity.''
   ``Perhaps so,'' the sentencing memo continued. ``But his lawyers
at the time took the incident seriously. They have told staff
members of the independent counsel that this episode caused
concern'' within the law firm.
   ``Whatever his choice of words, however, it is evident that
defendant Nofziger was alerted to and deliberately chose to ignore
written and oral advice that Section 207(c) (of the law) applied to
him,'' McKay said.
   During the trial, defense lawyers unsuccessfully sought to claim
that Nofziger had acted with the advice of his counsel when he
lobbied the White House on behalf of at least one client. Flannery
refused to allow the defense to raise this argument, saying it was
legally impermissible.

   President Reagan may go on the road to
campaign for George Bush before the GOP convention to give his vice
president an edge going into the fall campaign, the White House
said Thursday.
   The move indicates that Reagan is ending his official neutrality
in the GOP race before the party's convention, scheduled for Aug.
15-18 in New Orleans.
   ``I just want to signal you that that is changing,''
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   ``The president has always been ready,'' the spokesman said.
``He's ready at the drop of a hat to get out there on the road.
He's ready to get into the campaign at any point.''
   However, Fitzwater said, ``The president has always wanted to
get involved in the political process as soon as possible. It's
simply that his position on neutrality required that that could not
happen until after the convention.''
   He said the president ``could decide to do some events earlier''
in the light of Bush's string of primary and caucus victories,
which have forced all other Republican candidates except the badly
lagging Pat Robertson from the field.
   ``I think that in view of the way the campaign has developed,
and in view of the vice president's now seemingly assured
nomination, that we would rethink that situation in view of those
new realities, and that we could see the president involved in some
political activities before the nominating convention _ activities
that are directly associated with the nominee,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said a decision ``has not been finally made, although
every one is aware ... that the reality of the situation is such
that the vice president is very close to having the nomination.''
   ``Pat Robertson is still a candidate, in a declared sense, but,
he, too recognizes the realities of the situation,'' he said.
   Bush has more than 800 of the 1,139 needed to win the
nomination, according to a count by The Associated Press. Robertson
has 17.
   Bush was having his regular weekly lunch with the president
Thursday. Fitzwater said he did not know what they planned to talk
about.
   Fitzwater said no decision had been made on an endorsement, and
no events had been scheduled or were expected to be scheduled soon.
   ``I simply want to open the door to this new prospect,'' he said.
   Reagan, who defeated Bush for the GOP presidential nomination in
1980, has often spoken of him in glowing terms, ranking him at or
near the top among U.S. vice presidents.

   An Alabama fugitive known as ``Wolf Boy''
faced federal charges today after a 16-year-old kidnap victim from
Illinois was found tied to a motel bed, FBI agents said.
   Agent Kevin Rust said Gary Williams, 30, an escape artist who
fled the county jail in Decatur, Ala., last October, was armed but
offered no resistance when FBI agents surrounded the Carro Motel
and arrested him Wednesday night.
   Agents had spotted the car of the kidnap victim at the Carro,
Rust said.
   Michelle Yokum, 16, of Casey, Ill., was found Wednesday morning
tied to a bed in a motel in nearby Corinth after employees heard
her cries.
   Yokum told authorities Williams had left in her car. She said
that she had been abducted at gunpoint Tuesday night in Illinois
while making a delivery in her car from the restaurant where she
worked. The teen-ager said she had not been harmed by Williams.
   Williams was scheduled for a hearing today on a federal escape
charge in Aberdeen, Miss.
   Williams reportedly has made 10 escapes in the last several
years and became known as ``Wolf Boy'' while hiding out in caves in
Alabama's Bankhead National Forest. He was serving a jail term for
grand larceny and had numerous property offenses on his record.
   Authorities said Williams apparently approached Yokum's car,
forced her at gunpoint to move over to the passenger's side, then
started driving south.
   FBI agents said Williams is a suspect in the abduction of a

<HEAD>Northeast Slipping to Least Populated Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The densely settled Northeast has become the
nation's least populated region, falling behind the West for the
first time, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
   The bureau also projected that Texas will surpass New York for
second place behind California in population by 1995.
   And between now and the year 2000, half of all U.S. population
growth will occur in just three states: California, Texas and
Florida, the report said.
   The projections are based on assumptions about trends in births,
deaths, immigration and movement within the country, bureau
demographer Signe Wetrogen explained.
   The Northeast has been declining in its share of the U.S.
population, with less growth than other areas, Wetrogen said in a
telephone interview. ``It is the one region with the highest share
of population in the older ages, and has low birth rates.''
   Population shifts to the South and West in recent years have
drawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, ``so the
(Northeast) region is left with more older people, and it's left
without anybody to have more kids,'' she said.
   The Northeastern states, relatively smaller in land area than
other parts of the country, remain the mosty densely packed,
however. New Jersey leads the nation with more than 1,000 people
per square mile.
   Between 1987 and 1988, the Western region increased from 49.6
million people to 50.5 million, the report said. At the same time,
the population of the Northeast edged upward from 50.1 million to
50.3 million, to slip into last place.
   The 1988 estimates listed the South with 85.1 million people,
followed by the Midwest with 59.6 million.
   Historical records show that, while it was the center of early
American development, the Northeast hasn't actually been the most
populous region since 1820, when the South edged ahead. It remained
second until 1880, falling to third behind both the Midwest and
South.
   By 1990, the projections call for the South to have 87.3 million
people, followed by the Midwest, 59.8 million; West, 52.3 million;
and Northeast, 50.6 million.
   By 2000, the counts are expected to be 96.9 million for the
South, 59.6 million for the Midwest, 59.4 million for the West and
51.8 million for the Northeast.
   By 2010, the report added, the West could replace the Midwest as
the second-most-populous region.
   State population projections showed California remaining
unchallenged as the largest state, growing from 28 million people
today to 29.1 million in 1990 and 33.5 million in 2000.
   Texas is expected to surpass New York for second rank by 1995.
The Empire State now leads Texas 17.7 million to 17.2 million, but
by 1995 Texas is projected to have just over 19 million people,
with New York at only 17.9 million.
   Florida is expected to remain the fourth-largest state, although
by the year 2010 it may be closing in on New York as well, the
Census Bureau said.
   By the year 2000, Illinois will have replaced Pennsylvania in
fifth place and Georgia will move into 10th, displacing North
Carolina, the report said.
   The U.S. population was projected to grow from 243.3 million in
1987 to 267.7 million in 2000.
   In that period, California is expected to add 6 million
residents, Florida 3.5 million and Texas 3.3 million. That means
those states would have growth of 12.8 million people, 52 percent
of the national increase of 24.4 million.
   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, West Virginia and the District of
Columbia were projected to lose population this decade.
   Population losses in the 1990s were predicted for nine more
states: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Dakota,
Nebraska, Kentucky, Montana and Wyoming. On the other hand, growth
was predicted to resume in the District of Columbia.
   During the 1990s, the maturing of the post-World War II Baby
Boom generation will be reflected in the growth of the 45-64 age
group in all parts of the country. The number of people aged 24 to
44 is expected to drop in the Northeast and Midwest but grow
elsewhere, the report said.
   The study said the South continues to have the largest
percentage of blacks in its population, 16 percent. More than half
of all black Americans reside in the South, and that is expected to
continue.

<HEAD>Gandhi Nephew Wants To Erect U.S. Memorials To Non-Violent
Activist</HEAD>

   A relative of India's revered pacifist
revolutionary, Mohandas Gandhi, is working to erect memorials to
him in 15 North American cities, but Boston is having a little
trouble finding a spot for its monument.
   The inspiration and money is coming from a foundation created by
Yoges Gandhi, a grandnephew of the man who led India to
independence in 1947 with non-violent protests.
   Gandhi said Wednesday he chose this city of monuments to
revolutionary heroes as one of the 15 cities because he wants to
remind people to be better to one another.
   ``The statue of Gandhi will encourage people to follow the path
of non-violence. We don't want to focus on the man, but what he has
done,'' said Gandhi.
   The founder and president of the 5-year-old Gandhi Foundation
said he already has $250,000 for the project. He wants the statues
erected by Oct. 2 for a national celebration of the 119th
anniversary of Gandhi's birth.
   Boston officials from Mayor Raymond Flynn on down have welcomed
the memorial.
   But finding a site for the statue or monument is a problem,
because of the city's current state of construction upheaval, from
its roads to its skyline.
   Mary Shannon is executive secretary of the Boston Art
Commission, the agency that decides what monuments look like and
where they go. She said the five-member panel is leaning toward a
bas relief that would include text to better convey Gandhi's
message.
   Mrs. Shannon said the site should be worked out within the next
few weeks and the design selected by May.
   A statue of Gandhi is not incongruous for Boston, where
Revolutionary War generals are remembered as well as abolitionists
and Gandhi devotee Martin Luther King Jr., said Mrs. Shannon.
   Two years ago the foundation erected a statue of Gandhi in New
York City's Union Square.
   Other cities on Gandhi's list are Atlanta, Chicago, Denver,
Honolulu, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco,
Memphis, Tenn., and, in Canada, Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.

   A 77-year-old widower who lives
in a tiny mobile home and depends on a bicycle for transportation
has collected about $21,000 in interest from a long-ignored savings
account.
   ``I didn't forget about it,'' Henry Kinslow said. ``That's why
you put money in a bank _ to let it collect interest.''
   Kinslow closed his account at OneBank in North Little Rock on
Wednesday, saying he didn't want to pedal 30 miles from Conway to
keep tabs on it.
   Kinslow, a retired electrical engineer and former hobo, had been
told by the state auditor's office that his $34,482.29 in savings
was in danger of government seizure because of a lack of account
activity.
   Kinslow said the last bank statement he received showed a
balance of about $13,500.
   That was in 1972. The statements stopped because he didn't give
the bank his change of address.
   The state auditor's staff says $750,000 hasn't been claimed by
nearly 2,500 people whose accounts or other scheduled transactions,
like utility deposits, have been inactive for at least seven years.
   The office is conducting a drive, called the Great Arkansas
Treasure Hunt, to notify owners of such accounts under a 1987 law
which mandates that money from such accounts that is unclaimed by
April 7, 1990, goes into state general revenues.
   Kinslow's balance was the largest unclaimed amount, the
auditor's office said.
   A news report about the notification drive caught the attention
of a teller at Kinslow's bank in Conway. The teller notified the
owner of the mobile home park where Kinslow lives, and the park
owner drove Kinslow to the North Little Rock bank.
   ``I wanted my money. I worked for about 25 years to make it,''
Kinslow said.
   What are his plans for the windfall?
   ``Put it in another bank,'' he said.

   The state Senate began working today on
rules for its votes on two articles of impeachment to oust Gov.
Evan Mecham, and one lawmaker said he would try to reinstate a
third charge that was dismissed.
   The Senate, acting as judge and jury in the first-term
Republican's trial, met briefly and adjourned into separate party
caucuses to discuss how the vote should be taken. It was expected
to reconvene this afternoon.
   Republican Sen. John Mawhinney, who voted against the motion
Wednesday to dismiss a charge that Mecham concealed a $350,000
campaign loan, said some senators had second thoughts.
   Mawhinney said his proposal would still allow the Senate to vote
next week on the first two charges, on which testimony already has
been heard. The third charge would be heard if Mecham was acquitted
on the other two.
   Wednesday's vote came as a surprise to many senators and set the
stage for a vote as early as Monday on two other charges against
the governor, who also faces a May 17 recall election and an April
21 criminal trial.
   The motion to dismiss the third charge was approved on a 16-12
vote. However two GOP senators who opposed the dismissal were ill
Wednesday but attended today's session. Thus, lawmakers said they
would have to change two other senators' minds to get the 16 votes
to reconsider.
   One of the two who were absent Wednesday, Sen. Greg Lunn, said
he believed it was a ``serious error'' to dismiss the third charge.
   Meanwhile, lawmakers were considering whether to vote on each of
the two impeachment articles as a whole or take separate votes on
all 11 subsections of the two articles.
   ``I've been accepting the body blows for about 15 months now ...
and the ribs are a little bit bruised,'' Mecham, an auto dealer and
perennial political outsider, told a group of GOP supporters
Wednesday.
   But he said he still had plans for ``when I get back there'' in
the governor's office.
   The vote to dismiss the third charge Wednesday was a surprise to
most involved, including the senator who made the motion,
Republican Wayne Stump.
   Several of those who voted to dismiss said they wanted to avoid
prejudicing Mecham's upcoming criminal trial on felony charges that
he concealed a $350,000 campaign loan. That would have been the
subject of evidence on the third impeachment charge and Stump said
it would have put the governor in ``quasi-double jeopardy.''
   The decision set the stage for a vote as early as Monday on two
other charges against the first-term Republican, who also faces a
May 17 recall election and an April 21 criminal trial.
   Mecham remains accused of misusing $80,000 from the governor's
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership and of trying to
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state
official.
   Those voting for the dismissal motion were an unusual coalition
of all 11 Senate Democrats plus five Republicans who have
steadfastly supported the governor.
   Lawmakers refused to predict whether there will be the
two-thirds majority of the 30-member Senate needed to convict on
the remaining two charges..
   Democratic Sen. Peter Rios disputed speculation that Democrats
voted for the dismissal motion because they think they have the
votes to boot Mecham.
   ``I think this needs to be brought to a conclusion,'' he said of
the 5-week-old impeachment trial, ``and this is my view of one way
to bring it to a conclusion.''
   ``I've always been confident,'' Mecham told reporters Wednesday
night. He refused to comment directly on the dismissal. Defense
attorney Jerris Leonard said he considered it a victory.
   If Mecham is convicted, Secretary of State Rose Mofford, who has
been acting governor since Mecham's Feb. 5 impeachment by the
House, would become governor.
   The Senate was expected to receive jury instructions this
afternoon. Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday morning, and
a vote can be taken any time afterward.
   Mecham has repeatedly insisted he is innocent of all wrongdoing
and that he is the victim of persecution by the state GOP
establishment and the media.
   He has been surrounded by controversy since he took office in
January 1987. The day after taking office, Mecham canceled a Martin
Luther King holiday for state workers on grounds it was illegally
created by his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt.
   He also has made comments that angered blacks, homosexuals,
women, Jews and Japanese.
   The governor said Wednesday night that if he is returned to
office he would be willing to declare that ``bygones can be
bygones'' in his relations with the Legislature.

   Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday he resigned as
U.N. ambassador to protest Secretary of State George P. Shultz's
meeting with two Arab-Americans linked to the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Netanyahu said the meeting Saturday in Washington endangered
Israel's security and ``raises a larger question of the value of
American commitments to us when we have made huge concessions to
obtain these guarantees.''
   ``I could not speak freely (about this) as long as I was
ambassador. So I had to make a choice,'' he told The Associated
Press.
   The surprise resignation of the articulate, U.S.-educated
Netanyahu _ a rising star in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
rightist Likud bloc _ was the strongest signal yet of Israeli
displeasure over the Shultz meeting.
   Shultz, in remarks on Israel radio, said it was unreasonable to
suggest he could not meet American citizens.
   But Netanyahu said Shultz's talks with Edward Said and Ibrahim
Abu Lughod violated a 1975 U.S. pledge not to meet with PLO
members. The two are members of the Palestine National Council, the
PLO's parliament-in-exile. U.S. officials said their membership on
the PNC doesn't make them PLO officials.
   In addition, he said, the United States appeared to be clearing
the way for PLO participation in Middle East peace talks and ``a
PLO state right in the heart of Israel, threatening our very
security, our very future.''
   Netanyahu, who had served as U.N. ambassador since 1984, said he
was planning to resign in several weeks anyway to begin campaigning
for a seat as a Likud legislator in November's elections.
   ``I decided to resign early because of the critical
developments,'' he said.
   Likud activists hope the 39-year-old Netanyahu will give an
electoral boost to the entire party, which narrowly missed winning
a majority in 1984 parliamentary elections.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres has suggested Asher Ben Natan, a
former ambassador to France and Germany, as a possible replacement
for Netanyahu.
   Netanyahu, considered a close friend of Shultz, said he still
had ``warm personal regard'' for the secretary of state but that
his meeting with Said and Abu Lughod had created ``a deep rift''
between the United States and Israel.
   ``Even friends can sometimes take steps which are unacceptable
or dangerous,'' he said.
   He said the meeting heightened Israeli concern about a
U.S.-Middle East peace plan, which calls for an international
conference leading to direct peace talks between Israel and its
Arab enemies.
   ``I will pound the pavement from city to city in order to
explain to the public the dangers of an international conference,''
he said.
   Shamir and fellow Likud mambers have staunchly opposed an
international forum, warning that Israel would be outnumbered by
its enemies and forced to make territorial concessions.
   ``The very clear possibility exists now that the PLO will sit
across the table from Israel in this conference and will be the
party we will be demanded to give land to,'' Netanyahu said.
   Shultz goes to Israel on Sunday in his second shuttle to
campaign for the peace plan, and he is likely to hear plenty of
complaints there about the meeting with Said and Abu Lughod.
   Shamir called the meeting ``a slap in the face'' and told party
members ``It was possible to see on television how much they (Said
and Abu Lughod) hate Israel,'' the daily Yediot Ahronot reported
Thursday.
   Netanyahu, the son of a Cornell University professor, has lived
in the United States most of his life. He attended high school in
Philadelphia and studied business administration at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Netanyahu's brother, Jonathan, became a national hero as the
senior commander during Israel's 1976 rescue of hostages in
Entebbe, Uganda. He was the only Israeli officer killed in the
operation.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Thursday re-enacted Jesus
Christ's last supper with his apostles by washing the feet of 12
priests in a solemn Holy Thursday ritual.
   Some 3,000 worshipers gathered for the two-hour ceremony in the
vast, marble-columned Basilica of St. John Lateran with its 16
rooftop figures of Christ, the apostles and saints silhouetted
against the early evening sky. The 17th century basilica, built on
an ancient Roman property, is the pope's church as bishop of Rome.
   Earlier Thursday, the pontiff celebrated Mass at St. Peter's
Basilica in Vatican City, leading Catholic clergymen _ including 22
cardinals, 30 bishops and some 1,000 priests _ in renewing their
vows of celibacy.
   During the evening ceremony, the 67-year-old pope, draped in
white vestments, washed the feet of the dozen mostly elderly
priests in a service symbolizing Jesus' humility before he was
crucified on Good Friday.
   Wearing a protective apron, the pontiff poured water from a
golden urn onto one foot of each priest, wiping it with a white
cloth before bending down to kiss it.
   The priests, dressed in white, red and gold, were seated on a
platform under the austere, gold-leaf nave of the basilica, which
is said to contain the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul and where
until a century ago popes were crowned.
   The service included hymns and chants by the Sistine Chapel
Choir, as well as a homily in Italian by the pope on the theme of
Christian humility.
   The two rites Thursday began four days of ceremonies that
culminate on Easter Sunday, celebrating the passion, death and
resurrection of Christ.
   On Friday, the pope is to carry a wooden cross in the
traditional Good Friday ceremony starting from the torch-lit
Colosseum. He will celebrate the Easter vigil on Saturday night,
and a Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square.

   Cher says she enjoyed making the movie
``Moonstruck'' because it gave her a chance to be part of a big,
traditional family.
   In real life, Cher, 40, lives with a 23-year-old acting student
and copes with the travails of motherhood. Her 11-year-old son,
Elijah Blue, is ``a little superficial,'' and her daughter,
18-year-old Chastity, ``dresses like a bum,'' she complained in an
interview with Film Comment magazine that was reprinted in the
April issue of US.
   ``I'm not a cookie-baking mother,'' said Cher, who is up for the
Academy Award for best actress for her role in ``Moonstruck.''
``Well, that's not true. I am a cookie-baking mother, but I'm not a
traditional cookie-baking mother.''
   Her boyfriend, Robert Camilletti, on the other hand, makes
bagels _ and Cher said it infuriates her when people ``dismiss him
as a bagel maker.''
   ``Do I feel insulted when they dismiss everything about him and
boil it down to that, without a moment's thought to what kind of a
human being he is? Yes. I lived with him when he was a doorman,
when he was a bartender. I don't really care what he is.''

<HEAD>China Unveils Draft Laws To Give Businesses Autonomy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday unveiled the long-awaited
laws that release businesses from the shackles of state plans and
promise factory managers and foreign joint ventures substantial
autonomy in making decisions.
   The two proposed laws and a draft constitutional amendment
legitimizing the private sector were submitted to the 2,970
delegates of the National People's Congress, China's legislature.
   The delegates are expected to discuss the measures in small
groups over the next week and approve them April 13, the last day
of the congress' 20-day session.
   Rather than break new ground, the proposed laws would formalize
changes already under way in the economy and clear up confusion
over the new practices. The proposed measure on joint ventures
would provide a legal framework for foreigners doing business in
China.
   Lu Dong, head of the State Economic Commission, said the
proposed law on state-owned enterprises was essential to China's
modernization.
   ``Whether or not (state-owned) enterprises can have great
vitality will have a great influence on the overall development of
our national economy,'' he told the delegates, gathered in the huge
Great Hall of the People.
   ``Therefore ... we must separate government and industry and
guarantee the autonomy of enterprise management,'' Lu said.
   The government hopes autonomy will turn China's often
debt-ridden, inefficient state stores and factories into lean,
competitive production machines. They will be free to respond to
changes in market demand and also will be free to go bankrupt if
they make bad decisions.
   It is no coincidence that the government plans to implement a
bankruptcy law later this year.
   More than 70 percent of China's 90,000 state-run enterprises
already have signed contracts with the government giving their
managers some degree of adminstrative autonomy. The new law is
intended to erase lingering ambiguities over the roles of managers,
local Communist Party officials, local government and unions.
   Similarly, the proposed law on Chinese-foreign joint ventures
and the constitutional amendment allowing private enterprise serve
to codify changes that have already been introduced.
   Although the draft state enterprise law probably is the most
widely discussed in Chinese history, having been submitted to
special seminars nationwide, Thursday was the first time its actual
wording was released to the general public.
   ``An enterpise shall, in accordance with law, make its own
managerial decisions (and) take full responsibility for its own
profits and losses,'' reads one of the 68 articles.
   Enterprises also will be allowed to sell their products on their
own after meeting state quotas, chose their own suppliers, set
their prices and enter into contracts with foreign parties.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping first suggested such a law in 1978,
when he began his campaign to reduce central planning and
revitalize the economy through monetary incentives. Versions have
been discussed by four previous legislative sessions, generating
debate unprecedented in China's largely rubber-stamp congress.
   Official media reports indicate the congress' standing Law
Committee made revisions almost up to the last minute. One major
criticism was that workers could be victimized by autocratic
managers.
   Late additions included several clauses that promise wide powers
to workers, thus substantially eroding business managers' promised
new autonomy.
   ``An enterprise shall ensure that its staff and workers enjoy
the status of masters. ... (and) shall practice democratic
management,'' the bill reads.
   It adds that workers' congresses must approve wage adjustments
and bonus distribution plans, and have the right to supervise and
call for the removal of top company officials.
   The draft law on joint ventures would help standardize the form
of contractural joint ventures and promote their growth, Zheng
Tuobin, foreign trade minister, told the congress.
   The bill states that the joint venture ``should not be
interfered with'' in making managerial decisions, and allows either
the Chinese or foreign partner to chair the board.
   Chinese companies already have formed more than 5,000 joint
ventures with foreign companies, with a total foreign investment of
about $3.38 billion.
   However, many foreign businesses have complained about the lack
of a legal framework for their joint venture agreements.
   The proposed constitutional amendment declares the private
sector to be ``a complement to the socialist public economy'' that
is allowed to exist within legal limits. China currently has more
than 18 million private-sector enterprises, most employing only one
or two people.
   A companion amendment declares that rights to use land may be
transferred. All land in China is considered owned by the whole
people, but in the past year several cities have sold land-use
rights for up to 50 years.

   Four legislative leaders on Thursday said
annual sessions were ``an experiment that didn't work'' and called
for a return to sessions every other year.
   ``We have seen legislative expenses rise and we have seen good
lawmakers make the hard choice not to run again because they cannot
be in Concord every year and at the same time make a living for
themselves and their families,'' House Speaker Douglas Scamman said
at a news conference.
   Scamman, House Majority Leader Vincent Palumbo, Senate President
William Bartlett, and Senate Democratic Leader Robert Preston
support a proposed constitutional amendment that would put the
change before voters in November.
   ``They (voters) should have the chance to judge the efficiency
of annual sessions based on the experience of the last four years
and to register their opinion with their vote,'' Scamman said.
   On Wednesday, the House Constitutional and Statuatory Revision
Committee voted 12-4 to recommend legislation that would put the
proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot. Voters approved
annual sessions in 1984.
   Those supporting annual sessions, including House Democratic
Leader Mary Chambers, say state business is too complicated for
legislators to meet every other year.
   ``I haven't seen a piece of legislation (this year) that
couldn't have waited until next year,'' Bartlett said.

   Two crosses made from lilies for separate Easter
flower shows were rearranged into pillars after the American Civil
Liberties Union objected that the displays promoted religion on
public property.
   The crosses, part of the annual Spring and Easter Flower Show at
the Garfield Park Conservatory and the Lincoln Park Conservatory,
were altered Wednesday, said Nancy Kaszak, general attorney for the
Chicago Park District.
   Ms. Kaszak said she was contacted Tuesday by an ACLU attorney
who contended the crosses were a display of religious symbols on
public property.
   Because of the protest, park workers converted the crosses at
both conservatories into pillars of flowers, she said.
   Jane Whicher, staff counsel for the ACLU in Illinois, said the
diplays were brought to her attention by a staff member who visited
the Lincoln Park Conservatory.
   ``My concern is that the cross put up by a public body on public
property was a violation of the First Amendment,'' Whicher said.
``It shouldn't have been erected in the first place, but I commend
the park district on removing it so quickly.''

   The FBI said today it had cracked a major
heroin-importing ring involving trafficking through Sicily and was
arresting 233 people in the United States and Italy.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III told a news conference it was
the largest international drug case ever developed by the federal
government and said it has been a ``stunning success.''
   The arrests were the result of a lengthy criminal investigation
in cooperation with Italian authorities, and involved the import of
southwest Asian heroin into the United States.
   The 69 defendants in the United States include 38 charged in New
York City, six in Los Angeles and Boston, 10 in Charlotte, N.C.,
eight in San Juan, Puerto Rico, two in Cleveland and five in
Washington, D.C. In Italy, authorities intend to charge 164 people,
the FBI said.
   U.S. Authorities seized six kilograms of heroin and four
kilograms of cocaine during the course of the investigation.
Italian authorities seized 22 kilograms of heroin last month.
   Meese said the purpose of the investigation has been to
penetrate organized drug operations and not just to make random
drug seizures.
   ``The tentacles of this network spread out across this
country,'' he said.
   The attorney general declined to speculate on what impact the
arrests will have on drug traffic in the United States.
   ``Nobody knows for sure the quantity of heroin or any other drug
coming into the United States,'' he said. But the FBI's strategy of
penetration ``is going to the heart of drug trafficing networks
rather than just cutting off the tentacles.''
   During the news conference to announce the drug arrests, Meese
refused to answer reporters' questions on the resignation of two of
his top aides amid increasing skepticism on Capitol Hill over
whether he can continue to run the Justice Department.
   Meese, who is the target of a broadening criminal investigation,
turned aside at least half a dozen questions relating to the
possibility that he might quit in the wake of Tuesday's
resignations of Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant
Attorney General William Weld.
   ``The business of law enforcement is going forward energetically
and without interruption,'' Meese said. ``Our strong management
team is on the job.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who has called for Meese's
resignation, said, ``I think he has lost his credibility. It's a
joke when he's talking about drug enforcement when everyone wants
to know why he's still attorney general.''
   Frank Story, chief of the narcotics section of the criminal
investigations division of the FBI, said authorities also have
seized business assets in connection with the arrests.
   Suspects arrested today have been charged with conspiracies to
import, possess and distribute drugs, the FBI said. Authorities
used physical and electronic surveillance during the investigation.
   Authorities were alerted to the presence of a Sicilian Mafia
drug network operating out of New York City and trafficking in
heroin by a 1985 drug case involving a New York pizza restaurant,
authorities said.
   A government affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
said two of the defendants in the current case operate pizza
restaurants in New York City and another is a former pizza
restaurant owner there.
   Two of the defendants in New York City and one of those charged
in Charlotte are fugitives from Italian drug convictions, The FBI
said.
   The Sicilian Mafia's drug trafficking plan involved exporting
cocaine from the United States to Italy, where it would be
exchanged for heroin and then smuggled back to the United States,
the FBI said.
   Meese said the difference in the price of cocaine here and in
Italy made the scheme profitable for the network.
   Meese and FBI Director William Sessions commended the
cooperation of the Italian government and law enforcement agencies
in coordinating the investigation and arrests.
   Sessions said Italian law enforcement officials have made 68
arrests so far and are pursuing fugitives in Italy, Sicily,
Venezuela and several U.S. cities.
   ``The Sicilian Mafia that today's actions are directed against
is one of the primary groups responsible for the importation of
southwest Asian heroin into the United States,'' he said.
   He said the three other primary groups bringing drugs into the
United States are Mexicans, Colombians and Asians.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Looking Into Further Allegations Against Chun's
Brother</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government prosecutors said Thursday
they would investigate allegations that former President Chun
Doo-hwan's brother diverted millions of dollars in government money
to real estate investments overseas.
   Chun Kyung-hwan was arrested early Thursday on charges he
embezzled $10.4 million while head of the semi-official Saemaul
Undong (New Community) development organization. He also was
charged with taking bribes, influence peddling, evading taxes and
violating business, land and construction laws.
   If convicted, Chun, 46, could receive a sentence ranging from 10
years in prison to death.
   ``Our investigation will continue to check other charges that he
diverted a huge amount of money for land speculation in the United
States and Australia,'' senior prosecutor Kang Won-il told
reporters.
   Eight other people, including aides of the younger Chun and
other senior Saemaul officials, also were arrested on embezzlement,
bribery and other charges, officials said. They included the former
president's two brothers-in-law.
   ``It is agonizing to me that I have caused trouble to my
brother,'' prosecutors quoted the younger Chun as saying.
   According to the arrest warrant, the younger Chun amassed a
fortune in cash, land and stocks by using government and family
connections.
   He was named head of Saemaul Undong in 1981, the year after his
brother seized power with military backing, and resigned the post
in 1987 after reports linked him to criminals.
   Meanwhile, opposition parties charged Thursday that the
government was covering up massive corruption in the scandal, and
demanded the former president be questioned in the probe.
   ``The government has orchestrated another cover-up and fooled
the people,'' the Reunification Democratic Party said in a
statement.
   The party, one of two main opposition groups, demanded Chun be
questioned about charges of widespread corruption during his
seven-year rule, which ended Feb. 24.
   Authorities have questioned some 200 politicians and business
leaders about corruption or trying to cover it up to protect former
President Chun and his family, but none has been formally
implicated.
   Kang said Thursday he did not plan to expand the investigation
to uncover other crimes under Chun because most such cases were
closed through trials.
   Many observers here believe the probe of Saemaul, which oversees
rural and urban development projects, is part of efforts by
President Roh Tae-woo to distance himself from his authoritarian
predecessor.
   In his presidential campaign pledge in December, Roh said he
would investigate all irregularities under Chun. The former
president has not been implicated in the scandal.
   Government officials said Thursday that Roh will register his
assets with government agencies to show his determination to
establish a clean government.
   The officials said Roh has urged the Ministry of Government
Administration to carry out administrative reforms, including the
property registration of high-ranking government officials.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus Changes And Strengthens As Disease Progesses,
Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The virus that causes AIDS actually changes
and grows more powerful as the immune deficiency disease
progresses, according to studies at the University of California in
San Francisco.
   In a report to be published Friday, Dr. Jay A. Levy, professor
of medicine at UCSF, said he and a group of researchers discovered
the changing virus by studying blood samples taken over a four-year
period from four men who were infected by the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   The scientists found that as the AIDS patients became sicker,
the virus seemed to evolve and strengthen.
   ``It's surprising,'' Levy said in an interview. ``The virus
doesn't just stay the same, but actually changes its biologic
features. It looks like the same virus, but it's probably evolving
within the individual.''
   The studies started while all four of the randomly selected
subjects tested positive for the HIV virus, but had not yet
developed AIDS. Three of the men later developed AIDS and two died.
The fourth continues to have no AIDS symptoms, even though he tests
positive for the virus.
   In the three who developed AIDS, Levy said the HIV viruses
isolated from their blood samples became more and more virulent as
their symptoms intensified. Virulence was tested by exposing the
isolated virus to cells in test tubes.
   Levy said that when the subjects were experiencing the most
severe AIDS symptoms, the HIV from their blood was able to multiply
more readily. It also could more easily infect cells and would
attack a greater variety of cells.
   Viruses isolated periodically from the patient who remained
without AIDS symptoms, however, did not show any change in
virulence, Levy said.
   Levy said it is obvious that the virus must be able to
reproduce, or replicate, in order to evolve this increasing
virulence. As a result, he said, if researchers can stop the virus
from replicating, then it could be kept harmless, even though it
continued to live within the patient.
   ``You wouldn't get rid of the virus ... They are kept for the
lifetime of the individual,'' said Levy. ``They would just never
become strong enough to cause disease.''
   The UCSF researchers now are searching for the HIV genes
responsible for increasing its virulence and its ability to
replicate. If this gene can be isolated, said Levy, ``then we can
actually target some approach (such as a drug) of getting at the
virus and arresting its replication.''
   Working with Levy in the research were Cecilia Cheng-Mayer,
Deborah Seto and Dr. Masatoshi Tateno.
   A report on the study was published Friday in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, attacks and
destroys lymphocytes, a key cell in the body's defenses against
disease. Without this defense, patients develop infections or rare
cancers that usually prove fatal.
   The HIV virus causes AIDS. Patients can test positive for the
presence of the HIV virus, but not have the symptoms of AIDS.
Scientists continue to be puzzled why the virus often remains
dormant for months, and even years in some cases, before patients
develop the AIDS-related symptoms.
   The HIV virus is spread through sexual contact or through the
exchange of blody fluids. It is most common among homosexual and
bisexual men, and among drug users who have shared injection
needles.
   Since 1981, the Centers for Disease Control report a total of
57,575 AIDS cases in the United States. Of these, 32,190 have died.
Nobody is known to have been cured of AIDS.
   Other developements in AIDS research include:
   _Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore report
they have found that a protein essential for the replication of the
HIV virus has a novel chemistry that may suggest a new approach to
an AIDS drug.
   Alan D. Frankel said he and his collegues have discovered that
molecules of an HIV protein called Tat are bound together by metal
atoms. He said there are other protein molecules that also use
metal atoms, but the structure in Tat is unique.
   This, he said, opens the possibility of attacking the HIV virus
by somehow blocking the binding of the metal atoms.
   The research, which also is reported in Science, was conducted
at Johns Hopkins by Frankel, David S. Bredt and Carl O. Pabo.

   _The CDC, in a reversal of earlier recommendations, said
Thursday that children infected with the AIDS virus should receive
vaccinations against measles.
   Previously, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee of the
CDC said that children showing AIDS symptoms should not be
vaccinated because their immune systems might be too weak to
tolerate the live-virus measles vaccine.
   ``It's felt that the benefit of getting the vaccine outweighs
the risk,'' said Dr. Lauri Markowitz, a CDC measles specialist.
   Childhood infection of AIDS is usually from an infected mother
at birth, or from the transfusion of blood infected with the HIV
virus.

   The Teamsters union and the trucking industry
reached a tentative agreement today on a national freight contract
covering some 200,000 drivers and warehouse workers.
   The three-year National Master Freight Agreement would replace a
contract of similar length with the industry's collective
bargaining arm, Trucking Management Inc., that was scheduled to
expire at midnight.
   Terms of the accord, which still must be ratified by
rank-and-file union members, were not disclosed immediately. But
Teamsters President Jackie Presser said it ``addresses the economic
need of our members and advances their legitimate claims for job
security.''
   Going into the talks, Teamsters officials were under pressure to
end a pattern of concessionary bargaining since the industry was
deregulated in 1980 and win wage and benefit gains in the range of
3 percent to 4 percent over their current base pay of $14.71 an
hour for drivers.
   While some large carriers are enjoying fairly healthy profits
now despite freight rate-cutting wars among them, several smaller
companies are having financial troubles.
   Teamster employees of the smaller firms had indicated they were
more interest in job protection than large wage gains.
   Since deregulation of trucking in the last year of the Carter
administration, at least 78 Teamster-organized carriers have gone
out of business or been swallowed up in mergers. The union has lost
about 120,000 members in the industry since 1979, although it has
stablized in recent years.
   ``Negotiations were difficult because the industry is in such
financial chaos,'' Presser said, encouraging his union's members to
ratify the accord. Under the Teamsters' constitution, it takes a
two-thirds membership vote to reject a contract approved by the
union's leaders.
   Duke Zeller, a spokesman for the union, said both sides had
agreed not to discuss details of the tentative contract until after
it had been submitted for a ratification vote.

<HEAD>Bold New Consumer's Guide Rates School Districts On Scale Of 0-100</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A first-of-its-kind guidebook rating some 500
metropolitan school districts offers families relocating to a new
area a way to begin answering the question: Where are the good
schools?
   The answers in ``Public Schools USA,'' (Williamson Publishing,
$17.95) a 366-page book by 25-year veteran education writer Charles
H. Harrison, aren't surprising: Larger urban districts like
Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington generally rate low, and
wealthier suburban districts, especially in the Northeast, score
high.
   But what is surprising is the book's daring ``Effective Schools
Index,'' which rates all 500 or so districts on a scale of 0-100.
   The highest score by any district was Brighton, N.Y., an
affluent Rochester suburb cited for an excellent program for gifted
students, with a near-perfect 98.
   At the opposite end, Oakland, Calif., scored 13. The book noted
high levels of classroom disruption, vandalism, lack of funds and
``fair to poor'' building maintenance.
   Still, the book to be published late April is meant as a
consumer guide, not a scientific study or survey. Its introduction
stresses: ``We have not tried to pick the so-called `best
districts' in an area.''
   Harrison, who spent a year and about $10,000 of his money
researching the book, profiled each district using 22 statistics
gathered in mailed questionnaires filled out by the districts
themselves.
   Using 10 of those 22 statistics, Harrison devised his
``effective schools index.'' The median score nationwide was 58.
   School districts earned from zero to 10 points on each of 10
criteria: average daily attendance, spending per pupil, dropout
rate, average combined SAT or ACT scores, percentage of eligible
students taking the SAT or ACT, number of Advanced Placement
courses, teacher-student ratios in elementary and secondary grades,
counselor-student ratio, and number of students per music
specialist.
   Districts that didn't provide a statistic or misinterpreted a
question received a zero.
   Twenty of the 26 districts that scored 85 or higher were in the
Northeast. A dozen were in the New York metropolitan area, and
seven of those were in Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island.
   Outside the Northeast, Elmhurst, Ill., scored 91; Mayfield,
Ohio, 86; South Euclid-Lyndhurst, Ohio, 86; Bloomfield Hills,
Mich., 93; Westside School District, Omaha, Neb., 89, and Kirkwood,
Mo., 88.
   But quite a number of districts did not respond to Harrison's
mailed requests and therefore received no rating, including New
York City, Boston, Detroit, Kansas City, Mo., Boise, Idaho,
Charleston, S.C., Newark, N.J., New Orleans and San Francisco.
   And the guide covered only districts with at least 2,500
students located within 25 miles of 52 core cities _ meaning
thousands of districts were excluded because of size or location.
   The book also evaluated ``quality of school leadership,''
``quality of instruction,'' and ``quality of school environment,''
drawing on the expertise of about 1,000 local education reporters,
parent groups and others.
   Those write-ups offer consumers a way to look beyond the
statistics.
   ``Statistically, cities seem to look bad,'' said Harrison in an
interview. ``But our profiles point out that there are conclaves of
excellence, magnet schools of high quality, good principals and
good teachers. We didn't want to write the cities off.''
   Houston, for example, scored a below-average 30 on the book's
effectiveness index. But the district's profile praised its gifted
programs, and added building maintenance is good, ``especially for
a district of this size.''
   On the other hand, Grandview, Mo., rates a strong 70, but its
write-up warns readers to ``take note of the low score on the state
competency test in math.''
   While the numerical rankings are sure to attract the most
attention, they can be misleading taken alone.
   For example, Ridgewood, N.J. scored 86, earning perfect 10s in
many of the index's 10 statistical categories. But it received only
3 out of 10 points for spending $5,034 per pupil, well below the
$5,544 average for New Jersey.
   While Harrison's index penalizes Ridgewood for
``underspending,'' Ridgewood's taxpayers may, in fact, be getting
better value for their education dollars than, say, White Plains,
N.Y., which scored a comparable 88 but was awarded the full 10
points for spending $11,500 per pupil.
   ``Some persons might argue that our information does not provide
a complete picture of a district,'' Harrison wrote. ``Frankly, we
have never heard two educators agree on what data would constitute
a complete picture.
   ``What we have done,'' he said, ``is to enable every American to
fairly evaluate hundreds of school districts ... using a great many
yardsticks that educators themselves, government statisticians, and
scientific researchers consider important and valid.''
   Copies of the book, or information about it, can be obtained by
calling the publisher at 1-800-356-8791.

   Officials here have hired an outside
expert to generate noise in their courtrooms.
   Court administrator Eugene L. Farkas said Wednesday that some of
the courtrooms in the county's new $15 million judicial complex are
so well designed acoustically that jurors and spectators are privy
to even whispered conferences between lawyers and the judge at the
bench.
   ``In the circular courtrooms there is excellent paneling, recess
lighting, acoustical tiles and the sound seems to ring the ceiling
and come down upon you,'' Farkas said.
   Noise Unlimited Inc. of Somerville is working on the problem.
The firm is experimenting with a noise generator that utilizes the
sound system in each courtroom to pump in low-level sounds that
help mask conversations.

   Men like to see women's legs. So what else is
new?
   What's new, according to a poll published Thursday, seems to be
that while 36 percent of men say they favor miniskirts on women,
and 71 percent say they like skirts at the knee or above, follow-up
interviews indicate men generally concede that women have to
consider whether showing too much leg is a wise career choice.
   Greg Parker, of Palm Beach, Fla., said he likes short skirts
because they're ``attractive'' and ``sexy.'' But, the 25-year-old
engineer said, ``if you're in a meeting and everyone's dressed
conservatively, there's less distraction.''
   In The New York Times-CBS telephone poll of 1,654 adults, a
quarter of the women questioned said they had worn a skirt above
their knees in the past year, while 46 percent of the women said
they prefer a length below the knee. The poll was conducted between
March 19 and 22.
   The tepid response of women to the new short styles had already
been made apparent at the cash registers to those in the fashion
trade, prompting designers to show some longer skirts in their fall
collections.

   Snoopy pops up in the darndest places,
but when the cartoon beagle was found cavorting with a grizzly bear
and a laboring miner on the state shield, California officials
thought some prankster had gone too far.
   The ``Peanuts'' comic strip canine first surfaced in official
circles on the February issue of the Department of Corrections
newsletter. He appeared to have taken the place of the Roman
goddess Minerva as she stood on guard, the Sierra Nevada range at
her back, a cluster of grapes at her feet.
   ``Frankly, we first thought it might be the inmates'' up to a
prank, said corrections spokesman Mike Van Winkle. ``If I still
didn't know anything about it, I would think it was definitely a
Snoopy,'' he said.
   But, no. It was a simple case of bureaucratic thriftiness,
according to Curt Soderlund, spokesman for the state Department of
General Services. He said a thin line on a printing plate had worn
out, creating the appearance of ``something canine.''
   It cost $50 to fix, he said.

<HEAD>Toshiba Import Ban Gets Approval from Trade Bill Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday
to attach to their sweeping trade bill tough sanctions against
Toshiba Corp. of Japan and a subsidiary for selling submarine
silencing equipment to the Soviets.
   House members relented and agreed to the measure despite Reagan
administration warnings that a similar provision was too inflexible
and could bring on a presidential veto.
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, urged lawmakers to ignore the warnings,
declaring that he was embarrassed by the Republican
administration's reluctance to discipline Toshiba.
   ``The State Department has been kicked in the shins and instead
of yelling `Ouch,' they have chosen to surrender,'' Garn said.
   The complex measure would ban U.S. government purchases of
Toshiba Corp. goods for three years. It would ban all sales in the
United States of products from its Toshiba Machine Co. subsidiary.
There would be no waivers, but exceptions could be made for
national security.
   The measure calls for two- to five-year import bans to punish
any companies that in the future might send militarily useful
equipment to communist countries in defiance of Cocom, an agreement
among Western nations that is designed to control the flow of such
goods.
   Retroactive sanctions contained in the measure also would apply
to Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk of Norway.
   Like Toshiba, that company allegedly was involved in the sale of
computerized milling equipment that the administration says has
been used to produce submarine propellors that are hard for
detection equipment to hear.
   Cabinet members warned lawmakers earlier this week that
stringent sanctions against Toshiba could mean a veto of the
1,000-page trade bill that lawmakers are drawing up in a
House-Senate conference committee.
   House members had been holding out for allowing the president to
make the decision on whether sanctions should be mandatory. But
after three hours of debate, they relented and accepted a somewhat
softened proposal by Garn.
   The full conference committee in theory could drop the provision
or alter it, although that would be hard to arrange.
   There was considerable reluctance, but no outright dissent, as
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., accepted
the Senate offer on behalf of the House.
   Rep. Stephen L. Neal, D-N.C., repeatedly urged the panel to
trust the judgments of the State and Defense departments as well as
the National Security Council that a Toshiba ban would amount to a
mistake.
   Garn retorted: ``I was elected as U.S. senator to represent the
State of Utah in the U.S. Senate, and not Toshiba and not England
and not the State Department and not (Defense Secretary) Frank
Carlucci.''

<HEAD>Tax Gap Expected Incease by One-Third To $114 Billion by 1992</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation and economic growth over the next
four years will boost by one-third _ to almost $114 billion _ the
gap between federal income taxes owed and voluntarily paid, the
Internal Revenue Service said Thursday.
   However, IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs cautioned Congress
against counting on that money as potential income to reduce the
federal budget deficit. An undetermined portion of the ``tax gap''
represents taxes that would not be worth the effort to collect even
if enforcement activities were stepped up.
   ``Our estimates of the income-tax gap are measures of total
non-compliance,'' Gibbs told the Senate Budget Committee. ``They
are not intended to be measures of the potential for additional
enforcement yields.''
   Using information collected in 1983, the IRS estimates the tax
gap at $84.9 billion for 1987. That is down from $95 billion in
1986. The agency projects an $87 billion gap next year and $113.7
billion in 1992.
   Gibbs said the estimates for this year and the future are less
than they would have been had not Congress made significant changes
in the tax law in 1986. Those changes included cuts in tax rates,
reduced itemized deductions and higher personal exemptions, which,
the IRS believes, will reduce incentives for cheating.
   That increase in voluntary compliance among individuals will be
offset by inflation and growth of the economy, Gibbs said.
   Although the new estimates still indicate a sizable tax gap, the
commissioner said, they are considerably below what the agency had
forecast in 1983. The 1983 projection was for a gap of $115 billion
for 1987.
   The IRS said individuals accounted for $63.5 bilion of the 1987
gap and corporations were to blame for the remaining $21.4 billion.
While the agency expects the voluntary compliance rate among
individuals will increase slightly over the next few years,
corporate compliance will decline, partly because the 1986 law
shifted a significant part of the tax burden from individuals to
corporations.
   Individuals' underreporting of income was to blame for $48.3
billion of the tax gap in 1987; overstated deductions, $6 billion;
overstated credits, $900 million; math errors, $1 billion; and the
failure of many people to even file a required return, $7.2 billion.
   Jerome Kurtz, who headed the IRS during the Carter
administration, cautioned against reading too much into the tax-gap
figures, noting they are estimates based on small samples. He and
Donald C. Alexander, who was IRS commissioner during the Nixon
administration, agreed on a major point: The agency must be given
enough money to provide a top level of service to taxpayers.
   Recalling several years of what he said were underfunding of the
IRS, Kurtz said, ``If you have to write a letter to the IRS to
straighten out an account, you're going to learn the meaning of
frustration.'' In hiring and retaining employees, he said, ``the
IRS is not competitive with private industry.''
   Alexander added: ``How can someone whose salary is so low as to
be eligible for food stamps be expected to answer all the complex
questions thrown at taxpayer assistance (employees) during the
current (return) filing period?''
   The telephone ``assistors'' who field taxpayers' telephoned
questions are paid as little as $13,000 a year _ considerable less
than many garbage collectors, Alexander said.
   Jennie S. Stathis, an associate director of the General
Accounting Office, which oversees other federal agencies for
Congress, said the IRS already is weighing several GAO
recommendations for reducing the tax gap.
   These include a capacity for matching business information
documents against business returns just as computers already match
individual wage and income statements against returns; stepping up
efforts to improve the reporting of taxable tips; and trying to
find a bigger share of illegal income to tax.

<HEAD>Medicare Won't Raise Payments for New Anti-Clotting Drug TPA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials said Thursday they have
decided against increasing Medicare payments to hospitals for
treating heart attack victims with an expensive new anti-clotting
drug called TPA.
   ``There is a question as to whether the circumstances involving
TPA are so unique as to justify some special accommodation,''
Medicare chief William L. Roper said in a letter to the American
Hospital Association. ``We have concluded that they are not.''
   The hospitals have been pressing the Health Care Financing
Administration to take into account the high cost of TPA _ which
runs about $2,000 a dose _ in paying for the treatment of heart
attack victims.
   Medicare pays hospitals a flat, predetermined amount for
treatment of various illnesses rather than reimbursing hospitals
for itemized expenses _ such as particular drugs or procedures _
used on a particular patient.
   Those fees are adjusted annually to take into account rising
costs and other factors and are predicated on the assumption that,
while a hospital may lose money on one patient, it is just as
likely to reap an excess profit on another patient with the same
diagnosis.
   TPA costs about 10 times as much as other clot-dissolving drugs,
such as streptokinase, which have been available longer and have
been used on many more patients.
   Nonetheless, an HCFA fact sheet issued in connection with the
decision raises the possibility that use of TPA ``may even result
in cost savings'' by reducing the length of time a heart attack
patient would need to be hospitalized.
   ``It is too early to know what the exact outcome will be,'' the
fact sheet said.
   It noted that if TPA use does prove to increase overall costs
for treating heart attack patients, such a determination would be
taken into account automatically in the annual hospital payment
adjustments.
   Although TPA, short for tissue plasminogen activator, has been
judged safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration for
quickly dissolving blood clots in heart attack patients, the
evidence is less clear on whether it is significantly more
effective than streptokinase in saving lives.
   Trials making a direct comparison between the two drugs are
about to begin in England, but results will not be known for a
couple of years.
   Study results released at the annual meeting of the American
College of Cardiology this week showed TPA reduced the number of
heart attack deaths by more than 50 percent, when compared to a
placebo, in a study of 700 patients. A much larger trial, involving
about 17,000 patients, showed a combination of streptokinase and
aspirin reduced mortality by nearly 60 percent.
   The HCFA fact sheet also said some of the warnings carried on
TPA labeling ``include factors likely to be more prevalent in the
Medicare population than in the general population.''
   ``For example, almost 50 percent of Medicare beneficiaries
admitted for (heart attacks) in fiscal year 1986 were 75 years or
older, an age cohort for which physicians are cautioned to weigh
the expected benefits of TPA against the risks,'' it said.

   The Vietnamese government is prepared to make
the single largest repatriation of American remains since the end
of the Vietnam War, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   ``We are announcing that Vietnam will repatriate 27 remains to
U.S. government representatives on April 6, 1988 in Hanoi,'' said
Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman.
   Once transferred in Hanoi, the remains will be flown to the
Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu, Hawaii, for
identification, Howard added.
   ``This will be the largest number of remains repatriated at one
time,'' the spokesman said. ``Previously, the largest turnover of
remains was 26 on Aug. 14, 1985.''
   There are currently 2,404 Americans still listed as missing in
Indochina as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,767 are listed
as missing in either North or South Vietnam. Up to now, the remains
of 152 Americans have been repatriated to the United States and
subsequently identified by the laboratory.
   On March 2, the Vietnamese turned over 17 remains to U.S.
officials. Those remains have yet to be identified, however.
   The upcoming transfer would be the fourth since retired Army
Gen. John Vessey traveled to Hanoi last August as a special
presidential emissary, hoping to step up the process of accounting
for missing Americans.
   ``We've continued to press the Vietnamese and we are getting
some results,'' Howard said Thursday.
   Asked if the Pentagon could explain the sudden increase in
repatriations, Howard replied: ``It's really not for us to do that.
The Vietnamese are the ones who should be explaining to the
American people and to the world what happened to the rest of the
remains and where they are.''
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, another Pentagon spokesman, said the
Vietnamese government informed U.S. officials during technical
meetings in mid-March they were investigating 29 new reports of
remains being found or information regarding servicemen uncovered.
   Then earlier this week, the Vietnamese disclosed they did have
27 remains to repatriate, Schneider added.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the initiative taken by
Vietnam to repatriate these remains and hopes it represents just
one of many continued steps to resolve this long-standing
humanitarian issue,'' the Pentagon said in a statement.

   High blood pressure patients given the drug
metoprolol had a 48 percent lower death rate than patients given
more commonly used drugs, researchers said Thursday.
   Metoprolol (pronounced muh-TAH-pro-lawl) is one of the heart
drugs known as beta blockers. The researchers said this is the
first study to show that beta blockers can prevent more deaths in
people with hypertension than can the widely used diuretics called
thiazides.
   The American Heart Association estimates that 59 million
Americans suffer from high blood pressure, or hypertension.
   ``We now have scientific proof that if we start with a beta
blocker ... we will have a substantial reduction in deaths,'' said
the study's principal author, Dr. John Wikstrand of Gothenburg
University's Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden.
   Customary practice in the United States had been to prescribe
diuretics first for high blood pressure and to try beta blockers
later if the diuretics weren't working, said Dr. Stevo Julius of
the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor.
   New recommendations by a committee of the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute say that diuretics, beta blockers, or two newer
classes of anti-hypertension drugs can serve as the first-line
treatment for high blood pressure, said Julius, an advisor to that
committee.
   Julius, who was not part of the study, joined Wikstrand at a
press conference at New York's Plaza Hotel to discuss the study's
findings. The press conference was sponsored by metoprolol's
developer, the Astra pharmaceutical company of Sweden, and by
Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceuticals, which holds the license to market the
drug in the United States.
   The results of the study will appear Friday in the Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   Two earlier studies that compared beta blockers and diuretics
failed to find any significant difference in the death rate, said
Dr. Curt Furberg of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Furberg, who recently wrote a medical journal article reviewing
anti-hypertension drugs, called the new study interesting. But, he
said in a telephone interview, ``I'm not sure how it's going to be
accepted. It's possible we need to test it in a separate study.''
   Wikstrand and colleagues at 66 centers in Europe and Canada
monitored 3,234 men given either metoprolol or diuretics for a
median period of 4.2 years. The researchers found a 48 percent
lower death rate among men given metoprolol than those given
diuretics.
   The drop was mostly due to a reduction in deaths from stroke and
coronary heart disease, two complications of high blood pressure,
the researchers said. There was no significant effect on other
causes of death, suggesting that the drugs are safe, they said.
   The thiazides make up one class of diuretics, which relieve high
blood pressure by stimulating the body to expel fluid, thus
lowering the total volume of blood in the bloodstream.
   Beta blockers block the stimulating action of adrenaline,
reducing the rate and the force at which the heart pumps blood
through the body _ and reducing high blood pressure.

<TEXT>
   A 23-year-old Wall Street ``whiz kid'' pleaded
guilty to mail and securities fraud charges Thursday, admitting he
bilked $10 million from scores of investors and spent the money on
himself and friends.
   ``I obtained money from investors, and told them I would invest
their money in securities. ... Instead I spent the money on art,
automobiles, two homes and furnishings,'' David Bloom told U.S.
District Judge David Edelstein.
   Bloom, a 1986 graduate of Duke University, faces five years in
prison and a maximum fine of double the amount lost by investors on
each count.
   Edelstein set sentencing for May 12. No sentencing agreement
accompanied his guilty plea.
   Several months before his scam was revealed, Bloom was profiled
in a New York Times Sunday magazine feature on new art collectors.
   According to court papers, Bloom _ who was not licensed as an
investment adviser _ used his clients' money to buy $5.5 million in
art work, a $1.9 million East Hampton beach house, an $830,000
Manhattan apartment, $800,000 in furnishings for the two homes, and
two cars worth $200,000.
   The defendant also bought ``numerous items of expensive jewelry
and deluxe trips to the Caribbean'' for himself, relatives and
friends, federal prosecutors charged.
   Investors were sent papers indicating their investments were
turning a profit, sometimes prompting them to turn over more money,
said prosecutor Robert Plotz.
   To lure additional investors, Bloom claimed to represent the
Rockefeller family, the Sultan of Brunei and Bill Cosby, even
though he did not.
   Bloom stood with his hands behind his back at Thursday's
25-minute hearing and politely answered Edelstein's questions.
   Asked if he realized his ``money management'' operation was
illegal, Bloom responded in a firm voice: ``Yes, your honor.''
   ``I said I was a money manager, but I did not invest their money
as I told them I would,'' he told the judge.
   All the art will be auctioned at Sotheby's near the end of May,
with the chance that some investors could still make a profit, said
Bloom's attorney, Peter Morrison.
   Bloom was arrested Jan. 14 on a federal complaint; he had 130
clients at his Greater Sutton Investors at the time of his arrest.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Says No Surprise If Afghan Talks Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in an
interview released Thursday that he would not be surprised if
Afghanistan peace talks fail, and he accused the United States and
Pakistan of blocking their success.
   The ruling Politburo discussed what action to take in the Geneva
talks in light of a U.S. ``departure'' from willingness to
participate in a political settlement in Afghanistan, the Tass news
agency said.
   Tass also carried an interview Shevardnadze gave to the
Bulgarian newspaper Rabotnichesko Delo earlier this week, when the
Soviet official was in Bulgaria for a Warsaw Pact meeting.
   ``Not everything depends solely on us and the Afghan
government,'' Shevardnadze said. ``This is why one cannot but take
into account the possibility that the talks may not lead to the
accords expected of them.
   ``If this happens, we shall not see this outcome as
unexpected,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Shevardnadze said that if the U.N.-mediated talks fail, the
Soviet Union will withdraw its 115,000 soldiers from Afghanistan
``in a way convenient for the government of Afghanistan and
ourselves.''
   He didn't indicate whether the Soviet Union would stick to the
nine-month withdrawal timetable already agreed to in Geneva.
   Shevardnadze accused the United States and Pakistan, which
represents the guerrillas in the talks, of putting up last-minute
barriers with demands that Soviet aid to the Afghan government
cease at the same time as U.S. aid to the insurgents.
   The demand is intended to give the guerrillas legitimacy ``as
something more than a group engaging in armed struggle against a
lawful government,'' he said.
   Tass said the Politburo, holding a regular weekly meeting
Thursday, reviewed Shevardnadze's discussions March 21-23 in
Washington with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   ``Note was taken of the actual departure by the American side
... from its earlier stated readiness to take part in a political
settlement of the situation around Afghanistan on the basis of the
Geneva accords. Variants of our further steps in this question were
studied with due consideration for this,'' Tass said.
   The news agency did not say how the United States had
backtracked or what steps the Politburo was considering.
   Talks aimed at ending the 10-year-old war in Afghanistan
recessed for the Easter holidays. Negotiations were scheduled to
resume Monday, but informal contacts were expected over the weekend.
   Pakistan's acting foreign minister, Zain Noorani, said he was
ready to sign an agreement anytime and hoped for progress soon on
the issue of aid to the warring sides.
   He rejected Shevardnadze's comments that an agreement could be
signed even if the United States did not participate.
   The entire deal then would have to be renegotiated, the
Pakistani diplomat said.
   The New York Times, in its Thursday edition, quoted unidentified
U.S. officials as saying Washington was considering an arrangement
under which Pakistan would sign the accord, but the United States
and Soviet Union would have a separate understanding on aid to the
guerrillas.

<TEXT>
   The frequency of autopsies is declining in the
United States, possibly making it harder for researchers to
determine causes of death, the national Centers for Disease Control
said.
   In 1985, autopsies were conducted in 14 percent of deaths in the
United States, down from 17 percent in 1980, the CDC reported
Thursday, citing data from the National Center for Health
Statistics.
   The decline ``may have adversely affected the accuracy of
determining the underlying cause of death,'' researchers with the
Atlanta-based CDC said in their weekly report.
   During the five-year period, the frequency of autopsies
performed varied widely among causes of death, from 12 percent of
natural deaths to 97 percent of homicides.
   Autopsies in natural deaths dropped from 13 percent in 1980 to
10 percent in 1985, the CDC said. On the other hand, autopsies
following unintentional injuries and poisonings rose from 46
percent to 51 percent, and autopsies in suicides rose from 48
percent to 52 percent.
   In 1985, 34 percent of autopsies performed in the United States
involved deaths from other than natural causes, compared to 30
percent in 1980, the CDC said.

   Directors of a new national award aimed at
promoting the quality of American products said Thursday they have
raised $2.2 million to finance the competition and will announce
the first winners in November.
   The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award was created by
Congress in August and named after the late commerce secretary, who
was killed last year in a horse riding accident.
   Officials said Thursday that a maximum of six awards will be
given annually _ two each for large manufacturing companies, large
service companies and smaller companies engaged in either
manufacturing or service.
   ``Quality is a key weapon in America's arsenal in the
international battle for markets,'' Commerce Secretary C. William
Verity said in making the announcement. ``This award, which will be
America's Nobel Prize for quality, should help recognize the firms
that are making a difference when it comes to quality.''
   The competition will be supervised by the Commerce Department's
National Bureau of Standards in conjunction with a private
foundation created by the legislation to raise money for the
contest each year.
   Directors of the new foundation are: Sanford N. McDonnell,
chairman emeritus of the McDonnell Douglas Corp.; John J. Hudiburg,
head of Florida Power & Light Co.; John Young, chairman of
Hewlett-Packard; and Robert C. Baldrige, brother of the late
commerce secretary.
   They said $2.2 million of a total goal of $9.9 million already
had been raised from American businesses.
   Hudiburg said the new award would indicate to the world that
``we're willing to invest whatever it takes to insure that
America's commitment to excellence is recognized both at home and
abroad.''
   Officials said the winning companies would be picked on the
baisis of such criteria as quality assurance programs, with the
largest weight in the judging going to customer satisfaction.
   After a review of written applications, the contest judges will
make on-site inspections to pick the winners. The prize will carry
no monetary award but winners will be allowed to mention the award
in advertising.
   The U.S. prize was modeled after the Deming prize, which Japan
has been awarding since 1951 to recognize quality achievements by
Japanese companies.
   The Japanese prize was named to honor W. Edwards Deming, an
American quality control export revered in Japan for his work with
Japanese companies after World War II.
   Companies interested in finding out more about the contest can
write: Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, National Bureau of
Standards, Gaithersburg, Md., 20899. Officials said an application
fee of $1,500 is being charged to cover expenses, with a deadline
of May 20 for applications.

<HEAD>US Company Signs Drug Pact With China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. pharmaceuticals company signed an
agreement with the Chinese government Thursday that officials say
could lead to increased American drug sales in China and
development of Chinese drugs for world markets.
   Officials of G. D. Searle & Co. and representatives of the State
Pharmaceutical Administration of China said it was too early to
tell what specific drugs might be involved in the research
agreement. But both sides said it could involve a range of
products, including possible future AIDS treatments developed in
China.
   ``This is a good beginning between the United States and
China,'' said Liu Yonggang, a vice president of the Chinese
administration who signed the Sino-Searle Research and Development
Trust at the Chinese Embassy. Speaking through a translator, Liu
said it was the first such agreement with an American company.
   The agreement says Searle will have the right to license
exclusively any products that result from research and development
under the trust.
   Richard U. DeSchutter, president of Searle's international
operations, said the company already sells seven products in China,
although sales have been less than $100,000 annually. He said the
agreement includes $500,000 for drug development, with provisions
for increased funding later.
   DeSchutter said the potential Chinese market for foreign drugs
could be between $3 billion and $5 billion annually. Imports of
drugs and medical devices last year reached about $300 million,
Chinese officials said. They had no figures for the U.S. share of
the market.
   Liu acknowledged that China, where herbal medicine makes up a
large share of the market, still lags behind other countries in
product quality and research.
   He said more than 1,800 factories manufacture drugs or medical
devices in China _ including 600 facilities producing 4,000 kinds
of herbal medicines. Liu said China doubled its production of
pharmaceuticals between 1979 and 1987 and plans to put more
emphasis on exports.
   Dr. Shen Jiaxiang, deputy director of the Chinese pharmaceutical
agency, said there are some ``interesting findings'' related to
AIDS in China, although the country has had only about a half dozen
cases of the fatal disease, all involving tourists.
   Shen, talking to reporters after the signing ceremonies, said
researchers have identified several Chinese traditional remedies
that enhance the human immune system. AIDS, or acquiried immune
deficiency syndrome, breaks down the body's resistance to other
diseases. More than 31,000 Americans have died of AIDS.
   ``We may provide some help, but we don't have a cure,'' Shen
said.
   He said AIDS research is not specifically mentioned in the
agreement with Searle, but it might be one area to discuss.
   DeSchutter said the company has been involved in AIDS research
and the pact could lead to some cooperation in that area with the
Chinese.
   ``We have not had a chance to talk that out, but it's possible
our approaches could be synergistic,'' he said after the news
conference.
   Searle, with headquarters in Skokie, Ill., develops,
manufactures and markets prescription pharmaceuticals worldwide. It
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Monsanto Co.

   A teen-ager was accused Thursday in the
slayings of his parents, who were shot on their wedding anniversary
with a high-powered rifle, authorities said.
   Keith Wood, 16, of Kalispell was charged with being a delinquent
youth by reason of committing deliberate homicide. Authorities said
he was taken into custody at school Wednesday and admitted to the
killings. He was being held in the Flathead County Juvenile
Detention Center.
   County Attorney Ted Lympus said he probably try to have the
teen-ager tried as an adult.
   Nancy Wood, 37, and Jimmie Wood, 38, were shot Tuesday night at
their home in a remote area 17 miles northwest of Kalispell,
authorities said.
   Wood's body was discovered Wednesday morning by a co-worker who
had gone to the house to investigate after Wood did not show up for
work. The co-worker notified authorities.
   Authorities say the boy allegedly shot his mother in the head
with a 30.-06 rifle, stuffed her body in a sleeping bag and dragged
it to a bedroom, where he waited for Wood.
   Wood arrived home about an hour later with a bouquet of yellow
roses for his wife on their wedding anniversary, and was shot in
the back of the head at close range, authorities said.
   Authorities said they knew of no motive.
   The Woods also have an 18-year-old son who lives in Kalispell
and was not at their home at the time of the shooting, authorities
said. Lympus said he did not know what anniversary the couple was
celebrating.

   Dwight Eisenhower was surly, angry and
disagreeable and ``didn't do a thing as president,'' according to
his predecessor, Harry Truman.
   In notes for a book Truman never completed, the former president
lists Eisenhower as one of eight presidents ``we could have done
without,'' the others being Zachary Taylor, Franklin Pierce, James
Buchanan, Ulysses Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Warren Harding and
Calvin Coolidge.
   In notes for a book Truman never completed, the former president
lists Eisenhower as one of eight presidents ``we could have done
without,'' including Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge.
   ``I'm not one of Mr. Eisenhower's admirers,'' Truman wrote. ``I
tried so hard to be pleasant and cooperative when I was turning the
office over to Eisenhower, but he acted as if I was his enemy
instead of the fellow who'd had the job just before him.''
   Once he was in the White House, ``Eisenhower never made any
effort to put forward the leadership to which he was entitled, and
he didn't have any program,'' Truman claimed.
   Ike wasn't even nice, according to the Missouri Democrat.
   ``It's interesting that a single thing, that great smile of
Eisenhower's, gave him the reputation of being a sunny and amiable
man,'' Truman wrote, ``when those of us who knew him well were all
too aware that he was essentially a surly, angry and disagreeable
man, and I just don't mean to me, either.''
   Truman's comments, many of which were dictated to secretaries
and relatives in the years between his departure from the White
House in 1953 and his death in 1972, have been collected in a book
titled ``More Plain Speaking,'' edited by his daughter, Margaret
Truman, and Scott Meredith. Parts of the book were published in the
April 3 Parade magazine.
   Besides the eight worst presidents, Truman listed his eight
best: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, James
Polk, Abraham Lincoln, Grover Cleveland, Woodrow Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt.

   Passenger deaths during airline flights are
extremely rare, but crews are not adequately prepared and medical
equipment aboard airliners is insufficient to deal with the
problem, researchers conclude.
   ``Airlines simply can't count on doctors being aboard flights,''
said Dr. Richard Cummins, one of five authors of a study published
in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``They should take a look at the duration of the flight, the
number of passengers aboard and determine what additional measures
are needed,'' added Cummins, an associate professor of medicine at
the University of Washington at Seattle.
   An average 72 passengers die during flights each year, which
researchers called ``a vanishingly small rate'' of three deaths per
10 million passengers.
   The study reviewed deaths reported from 1977 to 1984 to the
International Air Transport Association, which has 120 members and
carries 50 percent to 60 percent of the world's scheduled
international and domestic air traffic.
   Researchers concluded that 56 percent of the deaths appeared to
be heart-related.
   Nearly two-thirds of the deaths during flight involved men,
whose average age was 54. Doctors aboard the aircraft came forward
to offer assistance in 43 percent of the deaths, the study found.
   Researchers concluded, however, that programs are needed to
train flight attendants in the skills of basic cardiopulmonary
resuscitation and the use of automatic external defibrillators, the
electric-shock ``heart starters,'' said Cummins.
   ``They are not part of the on-board medical kits now, and we're
not advocating they be added to every flight,'' he said. ``But some
flights should have them.''
   ``If flight attendants can be trained to open airplane doors in
an emergency, they can be trained to operate a defibrillator,'' he
said. ``And the machine provides a simple way to diagnose many
kinds of cardiac arrest.
   William Jackman, spokesman for the American Transport
Association, a trade organization representing U.S. airlines, said
flight attendants on most major carriers already receive training
in CPR skills.
   Earlier this week, Delta Air Lines attendant Nancy Holt used CPR
to save a stricken passenger for the second time in her career. A
man collapsed just after boarding her plane in Atlanta and an
unidentified doctor on board helped her until paramedics arrived at
the airport.
   CPR proficiency is part of flight attendants' training, Ms. Holt
said, and ``you never forget it.''
   Jackman noted the Federal Aviation Administration did not
include defibrillators in its August 1986 guidelines on mandatory
equipment for airline medical kits. Those guidelines are scheduled
for review this summer.
   ``Basically, our policy has been to land as soon as possible,
and in this country, that means no more than 20 or 30 minutes no
matter where you are,'' said Jackman.
   ``Crews call ahead for medical teams at the runway and, once on
the ground, we're certain that experienced, capable doctors are
providing treatment,'' he added.
   ``And we just can't ask flight attendants to diagnose an ailment
... to know the difference between a heart attack and say, a
diabetic one,'' said Jackman.
   Cummins countered that a delay of 20 minutes or longer could
prove fatal in instances of sudden cardiac arrest.
   ``The law doesn't obligate the airlines,'' Cummins said, ``but
it's time they started taking responsibility in some of these
emergencies.''

   The 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction was awarded
Thursday to Toni Morrison for ``Beloved,'' a novel which was at the
center of controversy when it did not win two other major literary
prizes.
   The prize for drama went to ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' by Alfred
Uhry, which like ``Beloved'' deals with race relations in the
United States.
   The prize for general non-fiction went to Richard Rhodes for
``The Making of the Atomic Bomb.''
   The prize for biography went to David Herbert Donald for ``Look
Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe,'' about the American novelist.
Donald also won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1961 for
``Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War.''
   The prize in history went to Robert V. Bruce, a professor at
Boston University, for ``The Launching of Modern American Science
1846-1876.''
   William Meredith, an award-winning poet associated with
Connecticut College, won the poetry prize for ``Partial Accounts:
New and Selected Poems.''
   The prize for music was awarded to William Bolcom, a professor
at the University of Michigan, for ``12 New Etudes for Piano.''
   The focus of attention this year was on the fiction prize, which
was awarded against a backdrop of controversy and literary politics.
   After ``Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or
the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers
and critics signed a statement deploring Ms. Morrison's lack of
recognition.
   Because she had never won the National Book Award or the
Pulitzer Prize, said the statement, published as an open letter in
the New York Times Book Review, ``she has yet to receive the
national recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely
deserve.''
   Ms. Morrison's ``Song of Solomon'' did win the National Book
Critics Circle Award for 1977, but the two other awards are
considered more prestigious.
   ``Beloved'' is the agonizing story of a former slave in
post-Civil War Ohio who struggles to cope with the brutal death of
her daughter.
   Ms. Morrison uses flashbacks, multiple points of view and a
singularly vivid ghost to describe the emotional trauma of slavery
from the perspective of Sethe, who kills her daughter rather than
yield her to bondage.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' the drama winner, tells the story of an
irascible white woman and her black chauffeur. The play follows
their relationship over a quarter-century, ending in 1973.
   The play opened off-Broadway in April 1987 at the Playwrights
Horizons Studio Theater and later moved to a larger off-Broadway
theater where it is still running.
   ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb,'' the winner for general
non-fiction, won a National Book Award last fall in the same
category.
   Rhodes, who spent five years researching and writing the book,
said in a recent interview: ``The making of the bomb is a story on
the scale of `Moby Dick.' I don't see much of a difference between
writing fiction and fact, except, of course, that fact has to be
documented.''

   Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond met today with
embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III to convey the ``deep
concern'' expressed by some members of Congress in the wake of
resignations by two top Justice Department officials.
   The South Carolina senator, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, refused to comment further on the nature of
the discussions with Meese, who is under investigation by an
independent counsel.
   In a statement issued by his office, Thurmond said, ``a numn Capitol
Hill have expressed deep concern about the
problems at the Justice Department.
   ``I went today to talk to the attorney general to convey these
concerns to him.''
   The meeting with Thurmond was the reason Meese was late fber
of people oor a
scheduled 12:30 p.m. EST news conference at FBI headquarters, where
he refused to answer reporters' questions on the resignation of two
of his top aides. The resignations came amid increasing skepticism
on Capitol Hill over whether Meese can continue to run the Justice
Department.
   At the news conference, called to announce a major drug bust,
Meese briskly turned aside at least half a dozen questions relating
to the possibility that he might quit in the wake ofeld's reported remarks
require a presidential
inquiry and decision.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about Specter's
statement, said only, ``Thank you for his general views.''
Fitzwater said he had ``no reaction'' to the remarks attributed to
Weld.
   The presidential spokesman said Meese was at the White House
today for a ``security meeting'' on an undisclosed subject.
   ``The president was involved in the meeting,'' he said, but
``there were no private discussions between the two either before
or after the meeting and none are planned.''
   Meese is the target of a broadening criminal investigation.
Department sources have said the top officials quit because they
felt Meese's legal problems were ``poisoning'' the Justice
Department.
   On Wednesday, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said flatly that Meese
should resign. Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd also called for
his resignation, calling him ``the crown jewel of the sleaze factor
in Reagan administration history.''
   Specter, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, referred to a
report in today's Washington Post that quoted sources familiar with
Tuesday's meeting of Meese, Weld and Deputy Attorney General Arnold
Burns, at which Weld and Burns turned in their resignations.
   The Post said Weld told Meese the attorney general's situation
presented a close call but that if it were up to Weld he would
present it to the grand jury for an indictment.
   The New York Times, in a similar report, quoted sources as
saying Weld had previously commented that ``he would have to
seriously consider indicting Meese.'' The newspaper said that Weld,
asked about that comment, would not respond on the record.
   Specter, asked about the quotes attributed to Weld, said, ``Up
until this moment, or perhaps yesterday, you had a situation where
the independent counsel was looking ... but I think now is a
different matter. The president has to talk to Mr. Weld, has to
examine the facts and then has to make a presidential decision.''
   Specter earlier questioned ``whether the U.S. Department of
Justice can function'' with Meese in charge.
   ``You finally reach a place where there is a cloud of suspicion,
a sufficient cloud of suspicion, that I think you owe it to the
president to remove yourself,'' Packwood said.
   Weld told the Times that he had become concerned about the
collective ``damage'' being done to the Justice Department by
having a man under investigation as its leader.
   The Times quoted a source as saying Weld told his aides in
announcing his resignation that, to him, ``it was a question of
moral authority and the tarnishing of the department.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said today that Reagan's
``duty'' is ``to bring about the resignation of Mr. Meese.''
   ``The president owes a duty to the country that may be much
higher than that which he owes to his personal friend,'' Metzenbaum
said at the start of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on
antitrust matters.
   The question, said Metzenbaum, is, ``if Mr. Meese does not
shortly resign whether the public will be losing confidence in
government as a whole.''
   The Boston Herald, meanwhile, quoted Weld as saying in an
interview that, when he and Burns told Meese they were resigning,
the attorney general ``thought we were joking. I told him it was
so. He seemed a little taken jaback.''
   For his part, Meese said ``there's no reason to resign'' and
Reagan reiterated his support for his old friend, saying ``he's
been a friend for over 20 years. I have every confidence in him.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked Wednesday why
Meese remained on the job when White House chief of staff Howard
Baker, Vice President George Bush and first lady Nancy Reagan
wanted him out.
   ``I don't think any of that is true,'' Fitzwater replied.
   Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said today that
reports that the first lady was campaigning for Meese's removal
were ``absolutely not true.''
   ``She hasn't talked to anyone and no one has talked to her about
the issue,'' Mrs. Crispen said by telephone from Los Angeles, where
Mrs. Reagan is visiting before joining the president at their
California ranch Friday for an easter vacation.
   Quitting with Burns, the No. 2 official in the department, and
Weld, were four of their aides.
   Meese predicted on Wednesday that Solicitor General Charles
Fried, who had said he was reconsidering his future with the
department, would not follow suit.
   Meese, who met with Fried on Wednesday, said ``I have no doubt
that Mr. Fried will remain a strong member of the management team.''
   ``Business is operating as usual at the Justice Department,''
Meese declared. He said replacements were being sought for Burns
and Weld and that ``everything is going along well.''

   Presidents can be reluctant to fire their
closest aides, and President Reagan, who has shown great loyalty to
top advisers in the past, is unlikely to oust his longtime friend,
Attorney General Edwin Meese III, White House observers say.
   ``He's been a friend for over 20 years,'' Reagan told reporters
Wednesday in response to questions about whether he would remove
the attorney general, who faces mounting legal problems. ``I have
every confidence in him.''
   His statement recalled the time in the summer of 1984 when the
president, arriving in Dallas for the Republican National
Convention, was quizzed about whether he would oust Labor Secretary
Raymond Donovan, who faced a federal indictment.
   Reagan declared that he wouldn't give in to a ``lynch mob
atmosphere.''
   When Donovan finally was indicted, he saved Reagan the decision
by resigning immediately. Donovan later was found innocent in New
York court of larceny and fraud charges involving a construction
company he co-owned.
   Reagan so dislikes firing top aides that an embittered Secretary
of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. had to try at least twice to quit
before the president finally accepted his resignation in June 1982.
   Reagan didn't fire Interior Secretary James Watt after he made
offensive remarks about blacks, women, Jews and the handicapped in
1983. Watt offered to step aside.
   ``After watching Ronald Reagan and reading about him all these
years, I've come to the conclusion that it is a matter of
leadership style that dictates that he not fire people,'' said
Robert A. Bonatati, who was Reagan's labor adviser early in the
administration.
   ``He never gets on the side of firing people and he always
defends people who are under attack.''
   Reagan has said steadfastly that he thinks public officials
ought to be presumed innocent until found guilty in court. He's
even gone further than that with two major figures in the
Iran-Contra affair, saying he believes former national security
aides Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter are innocent of
charges they conspired to defraud the government.
   Reagan's close association with Meese goes back to his days as
governor of California from 1967-75, when Meese was a valued
counselor. During his first months in the presidency in 1981,
writes Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, ``Reagan valued Ed Meese's
advice above all others, believing that Meese would see to it that
conflicting points of view were presented to him without
coloration.''
   In quintessential Reagan style, the president threw his arm
around Meese when reporters tried to question him about the
attorney general early last fall, just after the two had appeared
in the White House press room to announce Anthony M. Kennedy's
selection for a Supreme Court vacancy.
   But Reagan is not the only president who has shown great loyalty
to his aides. A former high-ranking official in the Carter
administration, describing the difficulty that Jimmy Carter had in
ousting budget director Bert Lance, said ``it's always difficult
for presidents to let go of people close to them, and that was true
of Lance, and it's certainly true of Meese.''
   ``These are the toughest issues for presidents to face,'' said
the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Presidents do sometimes swing the ax, however. President
Eisenhower ousted top aide Sherman Adams and President Johnson got
rid of close associate Walter Jenkins. Gerald Ford eased out
Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz.
   ``It's a major problem for all presidents,'' said the University
of Virginia's Larry Sabato. ``But few presidents have been as
reluctant and as reticent as this president to ditch people who
become political liabilities. Eisenhower thought it was important
to be cleaner than a hound's tooth.''
   Bonatati noted he lost his job at the White House despite
Reagan's aversion to firing.
   He said that when Faith Ryan Whittlesey arrived in early March
1983 to succeed Elizabeth Dole as director of the White House
Office of Public Liaison, Whittlesey fired him and several other
presidential advisers with short notice.
   ``She pretty much cleaned house,'' Bonatati said.

   The Charlotte Observer, the Miami Herald and the
Wall Street Journal each won two 1988 Pulitzer Prizes on Thursday,
with the Observer receiving the gold medal for public service for
its reports on Jim and Tammy Bakker's PTL television ministry.
   The Observer and the Herald led Knight-Ridder newspapers to a
total of six Pulitzers.
   The Pulitzer Prize board cited the Observer for revealing misuse
of funds by the ministry ``through persistent coverage conducted in
the face of a massive campaign by PTL to discredit the newspaper.''
   The Observer's Doug Marlette also won a Pulitzer for his
editorial cartooning in Charlotte and at the Atlanta Constitution.
   The Herald's Dave Barry won the commentary Pulitzer for what the
board called ``his consistently effective use of humor as the
device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns.'' His
colleague Michel duCille won the feature photography award for
photographs of a housing project plagued by a cocaine epidemic.
   Daniel Hertzberg and James B. Stewart of the Journal won the
award for explanatory journalism for their stories about an
investment banker charged with insider trading and the day after
the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   The Journal also won a Pulitzer in specialized reporting for
Walt Bogdanich's series of reports on faulty testing by American
medical laboratories.
   Three Chicago Tribune reporters _ Dean Baquet, William Gaines
and Ann Marie Lipinski _ won the investigative reporting prize for
what the board termed ``detailed reporting on the self-interest and
waste that plague Chicago's City Council.''
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Ellen Soeteber, the Tribune's assistant
managing editor for metropolitan news. ``I think the team of
reporters deserved this so much. It was their concept. It was their
idea, and they brought it off beautifully. I'm so glad some of the
leaders in our profession recognized it.''
   Two Pulitzers were given for general news reporting. One went to
the staff of the Alabama Journal of Montgomery for an investigation
of the state's unusually high infant mortality rate, which prompted
remedial legislation. The second was awarded to the staff of the
Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune for an investigation that revealed
flaws in the Massachusetts prison furlough system and led to
reforms.
   Tim Weiner of The Philadelphia Inquirer, another Knight-Ridder
newspaper, won the national reporting prize for his series on a
secret Pentagon budget used to sponsor defense research and an arms
buildup.
   The international reporting Pulitzer was won by Thomas L.
Friedman of The New York Times for what the board called ``balanced
and informed coverage'' of Israel. It was Friedman's second
Pulitzer for international reporting; his first was in 1983 for his
reporting from Lebanon.
   Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press
Dispatch, also a Knight-Ridder newspaper, won the Pulitzer for
feature writing for her series about the life and death of an AIDS
victim in a rural community.
   Tom Shales of the Washington Post won the criticism award for
his writing on television, and Jane Healy of The Orlando Sentinel
won the editorial writing prize for editorials that protested
overdevelopment of Florida's Orange County.
   The Pulitzer for spot news photography was awarded to Scott Shaw
of the Odessa (Texas) American for his pictures of little Jessica
McClure being rescued from a well.
   Except for the award for public service, which brings with it a
gold medal, Pulitzers carry a cash prize of $3,000. The winners are
selected by the Pulitzer Prize board and announced by the president
of Columbia University, which administers the competition.

<HEAD>Teachers Union Chief Calls for Experimental Schools Within Present
System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the American Federation of
Teachers said Thursday that small groups of teachers should be
given the autonomy and funds to create experimental schools within
regular public schools.
   AFT President Albert Shanker said the current public school
system is not working for as many as 80 percent of the students and
``we've got to do something totally different.''
   Shanker suggested that groups of six to 12 teachers be allowed
to organize their own schools, provided they can win the approval
of principals, fellow teachers, parents and education authorities.
   ``It is time once again to take a major step forward in trying
to improve the schools of our nation,'' said Shanker, whose
665,000-member union represents teachers in some of the nation's
largest cities, including New York and Chicago.
   He said state-mandated reforms and more stringent standards
imposed over the past five years have improved schools for students
at the top, ``but unfortunately (reform) is bypassing about 80
percent of kids.''
   ``We now need to seek ways that will enable any group of
teachers ... and parents of children who want to do something
different to opt for a different type of school,'' he said in a
National Press Club address.
   The autonomous schools ``ought to get their per capita share of
what the school spends,'' he said. Public schools spend roughly
$4,000 per pupil on average.
   Shanker said, ``There would have to be a guarantee that such a
school would be left alone for five or 10 years provided that
parents wanted to keep sending their kids there.'' They would be
strictly voluntary for teachers and students.
   ``If there's anarchy, the customers will be gone in no time at
all,'' he said. ``This is not pie in the sky.''
   He said such a system would give teachers an alternative to
trying to ``shove reform down the throats'' of unwilling colleagues.
   Shanker said only a handful of districts now are trying to
restructure public schools. He claimed his idea could open the door
for thousands of experimental schools.
   Shanker said he would want the teachers to include in their
proposals ways for teachers to govern themselves, to give students
alternatives to sitting in class for six hours listening to
lectures and to spur cooperative learning. The students also should
``reflect the composition of the entire school'' and not just be
drawn from the top or bottom, he said.
   Last week, Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National
Education Association, proposed that state leaders and teacher
unions designate at least one experimental school district in each
of the 50 states.

   Paint that has built up on White House walls
since 1797 is being removed as part of a project designed to spruce
up the presidential residence for its bicentennial in 1992.
   The National Park Service said the job will involve removing
some 30 coats of paint and repairing some of the carved stonework
on the sandstone walls. Work began this week.
   The work will be done on the exterior north walls and part of
the south walls and will be the first time in nearly two centuries
that these walls have been exposed.
   The walls will be kept bare until the spring of 1989 to allow
the porous sandstone to dry so the paint will adhere to the walls
better. Repainting is scheduled for next spring.
   The paint is being removed by brushing chemicals on the walls
and then flushing them with a stream of water.
   The work is being done by Ramco Technologies of Hartford, Conn.,
under a $384,200 contract.
   Vincent Palumbo, master carver for the National Cathedral, will
oversee repair of the stone carvings.
   The project is part of a long-range exterior restoration program
to repair and replace deteriorated stonework, remove old paint,
repoint and seal masonry joints and then repaint. The east wall was
restored in 1980 and the north portico in 1984.
   The entire program is to be completed for the bicentennial of
the laying of the cornerstone of the ``President's House'' in 1792.
The White House has been the home and office of every president
since John Adams.

<TEXT>
   Democrats looking ahead to New York's April
19 presidential primary are focusing on the mystery of a Cuomo
endorsement and the status of Jesse Jackson's ticklish relationship
with the state's influential Jewish community.
   The questions are obvious:
   Will Gov. Mario Cuomo endorse his fellow Northeast governor,
Michael Dukakis? Or will he stay on the sideline, fueling
speculation that he wants the nomination for himself?
   Can Jackson overcome the sour taste lingering from his 1984
campaign when he infuriated New York Jews by privately referring to
New York City as ``Hymietown?''
   ``Jesse got 26 or 27 percent (of the vote) in '84 after the
`Hymietown' crack and with a Fritz Mondale who had a very strong
call on the black constituency,'' said Cuomo. ``He'll do at least
that this year and probably substantially better. If he does 10
points better, he'll be at 37 (percent). You have four candidates
in the race, that's a big number.''
   Cuomo, perhaps the most prominent Democratic non-candidate, has
said his endorsement means little, but even his chief political
adviser, son Andrew, doesn't buy that.
   ``In New York, it has a particular importance,'' said the
younger Cuomo. ``It helps the candidate among those people who
haven't made up their minds yet or who are soft in their support.''
   The governor has said that within the next week or so he will
either endorse someone or announce that he's sitting it out.
   In 1984, Cuomo got behind Walter Mondale early, and with the
governor's powerful political machine in charge, Mondale scored an
important victory to blunt Gary Hart's insurgent campaign.
   At times, the New York governor has appeared to lean toward
Dukakis, but lately he has been saying nice things about Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and has been proclaiming that Jackson could
win in November at the head of the ticket or would be good as the
vice presidential candidate.
   And Cuomo has said Jackson could well win the New York primary,
an outcome that would seriously damage Dukakis, Jackson's chief
rival for front-runner status, and perhaps increase the likelihood
of a deadlocked national convention.
   Polls have thus far have shown Dukakis in the lead and Jackson
doing only slightly better than the 26 percent he won in 1984.
   Also on the New York ballot will be Democrat Paul Simon and an
uncommitted slate of delegates sponsored by a group of New York's
elected county clerks who would like to see Cuomo in the race. They
say the uncommitted delegates could be valuable to Cuomo if there's
any move to draft him at the party's national convention in Atlanta.
   While Cuomo has said he doesn't want a draft, he has refused to
rule out accepting one. New York City Mayor Edward Koch, one of the
state's most powerful Democrats, has said he's ready to lead a
draft-Cuomo move at the Atlanta convention.
   Numbers make New York's Democratic primary important. As the
second largest state in the nation, New York's 275-member
delegation will be second in size only to California's with 336
delegates. The New York primary results will determine the
allocation of 255 of the delegates.
   For Gore, New York could mark a new beginning or the end of the
road.
   ``I have to have a result in the New York primary that convinces
you that this campaign has gained a significant momentum,'' Gore
told a group of prominent New Yorkers early this week.
   In an attempt to carry that off, Gore has hired New York
political consultant David Garth, agreed to pump more than $1
million into New York and adopted a new campaign strategy of
attacking Jackson.
   In a speech to Jewish leaders, Gore contrasted his support of
Israel with Jackson's recognition of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   In New York's Democratic primaries, Jews traditionally represent
about 25 percent of the electorate with blacks at about the same
level. While Jackson is expected to capture the lion's share of the
black vote, anything more than a single-digit showing for him among
Jewish voters would be considered something of a miracle.
   Nonetheless, a recent poll by the Marist College Institute for
Public Opinion found that among Jewish Democrats surveyed,
Jackson's favorable rating has jumped to 36 percent from 17 percent
in January. But less than 4 percent of those Jewish Democrats
surveyed in the most recent poll said they would vote for Jackson.
   A Gallup poll, conducted at the end of last week, had Dukakis
leading at 44 percent to 28 percent for Jackson. Gore was at 3
percent and Simon at 2 percent.

   A cold shower won't do it, but a hot bath will
be just fine for mangoes imported from Mexico, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   The dip in hot water is prescribed to destroy hitchhiking fruit
flies that could come into the United States from Mexico, said
James W. Glosser, acting administrator of the department's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   About 65 percent of the mangoes eaten in the United States come
from Mexico and were previously fumigated with a chemical, ethylene
dibromide. However, the Environmental Protection Agency banned this
treatment.
   Glosser said the hot-water dip ``destroys all the fruit fly
species that exist in Mexico.''

<HEAD>Iraq Stops Missile Attacks; Iran Shells Tanker</HEAD>

   Iraq fired three missiles into Iranian
cities Thursday, then said it would stop for three days. No further
attacks by either side were reported in the month-old round of the
``war of the cities.''
   The Iraqi News Agency said the cease-fire would begin Thursday
midnight (4 p.m. EST) and last through the three days of a visit to
Baghdad by Turgut Ozal, prime minister of Turkey.
   As the announced time passed, neither side had reported any
attacks on each other's cities for hours.
   A Cypriot supertanker set afire by an Iranian warship earlier
Thursday meanwhile ran aground in the Persian Gulf.
   In Ankara, the Turkish capital, Iranian Embassy spokesman Riza
Bagri said Iran's missile launchings would ``automatically come to
an end'' if Iraq stopped attacking Iranian cities with rockets and
bombs.
   Tehran radio did not confirm Bagri's statement, but said Iraq
was the ``instigator'' of attacks on cities and Iran took
``retaliatory measures.''
   Hundreds of civilians have been killed since the missile duel
began Feb. 29 and thousands have died in raids on cities since the
Iran-Iraq war began in September 1980.
   An Iranian warship pounded the 232,164-ton supertanker Haven,
loaded with 1.5 million barrels of Saudi Arabian crude, for 90
minutes at dawn Thursday. The 45-member crew was rescued from the
burning ship, which ran aground later off the United Arab Emirates.
   Shipping executives believed the attack was a response to
several Iraqi attacks in recent days on tankers owned or chartered
by Iran. About 500 ships have been attacked by both sides.
   A U.S. Navy spokesman said two portable anti-aircraft missiles,
tentatively identified as Soviet-made SAM-7s, were found on a
drifting Iranian speedboat the Navy recovered last week. The
Iranians use speedboats for attacks on neutral shipping.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutionary patriarch,
exhorted his people to new effort in the long conflict, declaring:
``Today is the day of war. Today we must rush to the war front in
order to inflict punishing blows on the enemy, and with the help of
God we will succeed.''
   ``The enemy has proved his brutal actions by firing chemical
weapons on residential areas,'' he said in remarks reported by
Tehran radio.
   A dispatch from Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said a team of Swiss physicians arrived to visit victims of alleged
Iraqi chemical weapons attacks on border towns.
   It also said Iraq dropped chemical bombs on Marivan, a Kurdish
town about 25 miles northeast of Halabja, killing ``a number'' of
civilians.
   Iran claims Iraq dropped gas bombs on Halabja and two nearby
Kurdish towns in Iraq two weeks ago, after Iranian troops captured
them. Iran said 5,000 people were killed in the attack and 5,000
wounded.
   Iraq said it fired two surface-to-surface missiles Thursday into
Isfahan, which was Persia's capital in the 17th century, and one
into Qom, seat of Iran's religious hierarchy.
   Since the missile exchange began, Iraq has reported launching
105 missiles at Iranian cities. Iran says it has fired 45 missiles
at Baghdad and dozens into other Iraqi cities.
   Turkish Embassy officials in Baghdad said Ozal would arrive
Friday afternoon accompanied by senior officials. Turkey maintains
good relations with both Iraq and Iran and has tried to act as
mediaor.
   An Iraqi government spokesman was quoted by the official news
agency as saying attacks on Iranian cities would not resume ``until
six hours after the Turkish prime minister's departure'' on Sunday.
   The Cypriot tanker was attacked near the narrow Strait of
Hormuz, through which all ships must pass to enter or leave the
gulf. Shipping executives said it drifted for more than three hours
before running aground.
   Crew members huddled on the stern, unable because of the fire to
reach the engine room and stop the engines, and they were rescued a
few at a time. Tugboats brought the blaze under control later, said
the informants, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Maj. Barry Willey, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command,
said the SAM-7s were found along with other weapons in an abandoned
Iranian speedboat picked up in the Strait of Hormuz a week ago.
   He said a twin-barreled gun mounted in the cockpit of the
30-foot boat was a Soviet-made ZSU 23mm anti-aircraft weapon.
   SAM-7 missiles, which Iran is known to possess, are
shoulder-fired weapons similar to the U.S.-made Redeye.

<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd said
Thursday he will not call up the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile
treaty for debate until the question of whether the pact bans
futuristic weapons is better resolved.
   But Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the Senate's deputy GOP leader,
said the White House has put ``400 lawyers to work'' on the issue
and added: ``I think it can be resolved.''
   Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., a member of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said, however, that the general question of futuristic
weapons is a serious one and must be addressed sooner or later.
   Hecht said U.S. intelligence reports show the Soviet Union has
10,000 scientists working on the development of futuristic weapons
using lasers and directed energy.
   Hecht said the information came from a classified intelligence
briefing, but that he had been given permission to release it.
   Byrd told reporters that the question of futuristic weapons had
been addressed inadequately by the administration and it was not
clear that they are banned by the treaty's restrictions.
   ``It is too important to risk going ahead,'' Byrd said. ``It is
better to be sure, to be cautious and to be right. I intend not to
call it up until it is better resolved than it is now.''
   ``The treaty has to be good for us,'' Byrd said, adding that his
decision to delay action on the treaty is ``a signal to the
administration not to do in haste'' what should be done with care.
   On another treaty issue, a group of Republican senators told
reporters at a luncheon meeting they believed compromise eventually
will be reached on a move by Democrats to attach to the pact
language intended to bind future presidents to the current view of
the meaning and impact of the treaty.
   Sen. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, called the Democratic effort ``an egregious
insult to President Reagan'' and said it will not be settled
without a pitched battle.
   ``The Democrats will not let the treaty die because of this but
we might come perilously close before someone backs down,'' Evans
said.
   ``There is one group trying to kill the treaty and another group
trying to embarrass the president, and neither group will win,''
Evans said.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he also believed the
controversy will be resolved.
   ``The Democrats will not let the treaty die on this issue,''
McConnell said. ``I cannot believe that when push comes to shove
they are going to want to be held responsible by the American
people for failure to ratify this treaty.''
   The dispute grew out the Reagan administration's
reinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to
permit the deloyment of a strategic defense system.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 17-2 vote on
Wednesday to approve the treaty and send it to the full Senate,
where it was expected to be taken up following next week's Easter
recess.
   Ambassador Maynard Glitman, the chief U.S. negotiator for the
treaty, told the committee that the treaty does ban future weapons
and that the Soviets understands they are banned.
   Glitman said the treaty calls for the elimination of all
``weapon delivery vehicles'' with a range from between 400 miles
and 3,400 miles, asserting this covers all weapons, not just those
armed with nuclear warheads.

   Five statues of the late President John F. Kennedy
were displayed on a tabletop Thursday for members of a special
legislative board who will select one of the designs for a monument
on the Statehouse lawn.
   Selection of the winning sculpture design will conclude a
yearlong competition that included hundreds of entries from artists
around the country.
   Three of the statues on display at the John F. Kennedy Library
were made of white plaster, one of bronze and one, still wet, of
clay. They ranged in height from 2 feet to 3 feet.
   All the finalists show Kennedy in traditional design in full
figure. In one submission, he is wearing an open overcoat, which is
blowing in the wind.
   The five semifinalist sculptors are: Frederick Hart of Markham,
Va.; Penelope Jencks of Newton; Robert White of St. James, Va.;
Isable McIlvain of Concord, and Norman Legassie, Jr. of Old Lyme,
Conn.
   ``For the past 25 years, since the death of John F. Kennedy,
Massachusetts has been without an official state monument to its
beloved native son,'' said state Rep. John MacGovern, the
commission chairman. ``The absence of the late president from this
state's proud display of monuments is about to be corrected with a
memorial that every citizen of the commonwealth can be proud of.''
   After a brief introduction by former Kennedy aide Dave Powers,
MacGovern said the nationwide search for a sculptor was almost
over. Paraphrasing Winston Churchill, MacGovern said, ``this is not
the beginning of the end, it is perhaps the end of the beginning.''
   Commission members will be casting their votes for a memorial
finalist over the next few days.
   Caroline Kennedy, Kennedy's daughter and a member of the
commission, will attend the April 7 news conference annoucing the
winning sculpture.
   The JFK statue, which will be the commonwealth's official
monument to Kennedy, will be erected on the west front lawn of the
Statehouse. It is hoped that the dedication of the memorial will
take place May 29, 1989, which would have been Kennedy's 72nd
birthday.
   Kennedy, a Democrat who was elected president in 1960 and
assassinated in 1963, began his political career in the 1940s
representing Boston in Congress.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Honduras Exercise To Cost At Least $5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deployment of more than 3,100 troops to
Honduras as a show of force and warning to Nicaragua will cost at
least $5 million, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said final
figures won't be available for 30 to 60 days. But, he said, ``The
total cost of the operation is estimated at somewhere between $5
million and $10 million.''
   Howard was asked about the cost of the so-called Emergency
Deployment Readiness Exercise after announcing the last soldiers
from the 82nd Airborne Division had returned home to Fort Bragg,
N.C., Thursday morning.
   ``Some logistical support people will be returning tomorrow
(Friday),'' he added. ``All the equipment and supplies not expended
in the operation will be returned to the United States.''
   Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne and the 7th Light Infantry
Division at Fort Ord, Calif., were airlifted on March 17 and 18
after Nicaraguan troops crossed into Honduras to mount an attack on
U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas.
   The American soldiers were then flown to different parts of
Honduras for exercises with Honduran army units.
   ``We're very pleased with the accomplishments of this
exercise,'' Howard said. ``It demonstrates the responsiveness and
deployability of the Army's light forces in a joint operation.''

   Regional Communist Party officials admitted they
are powerless to end an ethnic dispute that has led to a massive
work stoppage by Armenians in a southern city, and they appealed to
Moscow for help, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The government daily Izvestia said the Stepanakert City
Committee unanimously passed a resolution calling on national party
leaders to again take up the issue of the Nagorno-Karabakh region
of Azerbaijan.
   Armenians are demanding that the Armenian-dominated region be
made part of their republic, which neighbors Azerbaijan.
   The local committee's appeal, adopted at a meeting Wednesday,
did not persuade people to return to work, according to one
resident in Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``People aren't even thinking of going to work,'' said the
resident, a man answering the telephone at the Sovietsky Karabakh
newspaper Thursday. He refused to identify himself.
   Izvestia said the plenary meeting of the Stepanakert City
Committee was stormy and that one speaker broke down and cried.
   ``The majority of the Communists decisively condemned the tactic
of `forced pressure' on the country's leadership, and along with
that every speaker underlined that the Nagorno-Karabakh problem has
not been removed, that it still needs a settlement,'' Izvestia said.
   Izvestia said the work stoppage gave new ammunition to people
who say Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms permit too
much outspokenness.
   Izvestia quoted a Stepanakert party official, Robert Kocharyan,
as saying that ``continuing worker absences give supporters of the
old (way) grounds to say: `Here's your result! You let the people
get out of hand. You shouldn't give them such an occasion.'''
   Izvestia did not provide other details of the meeting, and a
woman answering the telephone at the city committee's offices
referred all questions to the party Central Committee in Moscow.
   Stepanakert workers have vowed to continue the walkout, which
began March 24, until the central government and party reverse
their decisions to keep Nagorno-Karabakh under the control of
Azerbaijan.
   The Communist Party Central Committee refused the Armenians'
demand in February and was asked by the local committee to
reconsider the decision. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
national parliament, ordered cultural and economic improvements for
the region on March 23 but did not address the territorial issue.
   All but bakeries and dairies, some stores and some public
transportation and medical clinics have been closed in Stepanakert
since the strike began.
   Kocharyan said just 308 workers, only one-fifth of the force,
showed up Thursday at the silk factory where he works.
   ``For me that's zero, and as a party secretary, I'm ashamed for
myself and my comrades,'' he told Izvestia.
   The man at the Sovietsky Karabakh newspaper said there were no
demonstrations in Stepanakert and that few policemen were on the
street.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov provided
the first official confirmation that Paruyr Ayrikyan, a former
political prisoner, was among Armenian nationalists arrested last
week in the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
   The spokesman, at a regular news briefing, said he did not know
under which criminal statute Ayrikyan was being held.
   The Soviet government has forbidden foreign journalists from
traveling to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Gerasimov was asked
about that policy after he criticized Israel's government for
barring journalists from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where unrest has raged since December.
   ``I have to reject your parallel,'' Gerasimov said. ``We have
not occupied anybody anywhere in this situation.'' He said
journalists would have to ``wait a little while'' to visit the
region, ``until the passions cool down.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pompidou Center is displaying more than 400
works by the Russian-born painter Marc Chagall that were turned
over to the government in lieu of taxes.
   Many of them have never been seen before in public.
   ``The value of the collection cannot be estimated,'' said
Finance Minister Edouard Balladur. ``The government never could
have afforded to allocate such sums to enrich the national
heritage.''
   Chagall died in 1985 at his home in southern France at the age
of 97. Working steadily until the end, he left behind a vast
private collection of oil paintings, drawings, mosaics, sketches,
book illustrations, set designs, and engravings worth countless
millions of dollars.
   The works, previously owned by the Chagall family, are displayed
in four galleries on the Pompidou Center's fourth floor.
   The works represent the second largest donation ever accepted in
lieu of death duties. The largest one came from Pablo Picasso's
heirs and constitute what is now the permanent collection of the
Picasso Museum, housed in the Hotel Sale in central Paris.
   Government officials have not decided how the Chagall collection
will be dispersed among France's many national museums, but it is
likely that works with biblical themes will go to the National
Museum of Chagall's Biblical Message in Nice.
   Many of the works on show are known to have been among the ones
the artist loved the best. They include ``Bella au Col Blanc,''
(1917), a sensitive portrait of his first wife, Bella, dressed in a
low-cut dark dress, her graceful features and black hair set off by
a wide, white collar.
   Bella died in New York in 1944. Chagall married Valentina
Brodsky in 1952.
   The painting has a cubist touch, and many critics say it is
reminiscent of Picasso's masterpiece ``Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.''
   ``The paintings look fine in Paris, but they weren't bad in my
house either,'' said Chagall's widow, known as Vava, during a tour
of the show.
   The exhibition, which runs until June 5, also features ``Les
Maries de la Tour Eiffel'' (1938-39), set and costume designs
created for Moscow's Jewish Theater including those for Gogol's
``Revizor,'' and several self-portraits.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has
published a booklet designed to teach ``latchkey'' children basic
skills they will need to make their time at home alone safer.
   The 16-page booklet, titled ``What If I'm Home Alone? Your
Family's Guide to Home and Personal Safety Skills,'' teaches
children such things as how to get home from school safely, how to
use a telephone in an emergency, how to escape a fire and how to
deal with strangers who knock at the door.
   The publication is written in an easy-to-read, entertaining
style with large type and illustrations. It also includes a quiz at
the end so parents can assess how well their children understand
the safety tips.
   The booklet opens with a letter to parents suggesting ways they
can make their home safer and includes a form for emergency and
other phone numbers they can fill in and post near the telephone.
   The booklet is part of a CPB public service campaign designed to
help American families cope with changes in society that have left
a majority of families headed by a single parent or two working
parents.
   An estimated 5 million to 6 million children ages 5 to 12 who
daily come home to an empty house or apartment or have to care for
younger siblings, CPB said.
   The campaign is being run in conjunction with public
broadcasting's year-long, national ``Child Care America'' project
being kicked off April 10. The project will focus attention on the
issue throughout the year with outreach activities and programming,
including a PBS documentary called ``Who Cares for the Children?''
   CPB is a private, nonprofit corporation funded by Congress to
develop noncommercial radio and television services.
   Copies of the booklet are available for $1 each, by check, by
writing to ``What If I'm Home Alone?,'' Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, P.O. Box 33039-LK, Washington, D.C., 20033.

<TEXT>
   The warning broadcast over the radio for the
first time Thursday was simple: three beeps, a pause, then three
more beeps.
   That signal would mean Iraq has launched a poison gas attack on
Tehran, where Iraqi missiles have fallen day and night and where
fears of chemical warfare by Baghdad are growing.
   After the warning beeps on Tehran Radio, an announcer said:
``God willing, we hope no such thing will ever happen, but the
enemy is so mean and despicable he could do anything.''
   An official of the Islamic Guidance Ministry escorting visiting
Western correspondents around the battered capital, a city of more
than 6 million people, said the Iraqis ``would pay dearly if they
dared to do it.''
   The city of Tehran seems to have paid enough already. Officials
said half of its population has left since Iraq's missiles began
wrecking apartment houses, markets, shops, office buildings,
hospitals and schools.
   On Thursday, many Tehran schools and stores stayed closed in
case of attack, but people came up to the streets from underground
shelters. There were few of the traffic jams for which Tehran was
notorious before the missiles.
   The missiles that have been rained on the city since Feb. 29,
when the Iraqis began firing such weapons into Tehran for the first
time in the war.
   Iraq says it has launched more than 100 surface-to-surface
rockets at Tehran in that period. Others have have hit the holy
city of Qom, 100 miles to the south, and Isfahan in central Iran,
which was the capital of Persia during the 17th century.
   Iran has fired about half as many missiles into Baghdad, a city
of 5 million.
   A statement by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini exhorted his people
to ignore Iraqi missiles and turn out for the April 8 parliamentary
elections.
   ``Even if the nation is subjected to missile and bombing
attacks, it will go to the ballot box,'' said the statement, read
on the radio by an announcer. ``I personally will participate in
the elections under any conditions.''
   By Thursday, no Iraqi missiles had exploded in Tehran for three
days, although other cities were hit. Iraq declared Thursday that
it was suspending attacks for three days because of a visit to
Baghdad by Turgut Ozal, prime minister of Turkey.
   Officials in Tehran said they believe the reason is the
scheduled arrival Monday of two U.N. experts, James Holger of the
United States and Dr. Manuel Carmona of Spain, to investigate the
alleged Iraqi gas attacks in Kurdistan. A 1925 Geneva agreement
outlaws the use of chemical weapons.
   Civilians usually have about four minutes notice of incoming
rockets after they are detected by radar installations at the
border, about 290 miles to the west.
   The radio and street loudspeakers blare warnings. People scurry
to bomb shelters, basements and underground parking lots. Yellow
signs on walls show where shelters are located.
   State television broadcasts film of Londoners sheltering in
subway stations during the German blitz of 1940. The message seems
to be that, like Britain and its Allies, Iran will win the war.
   But it is poison gas that residents of Tehran fear most,
according to those questioned randomly on the streets Thursday.
   Iran said Iraqi warplanes dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs
on three Kurdish towns in northeast Iraq on March 16-17 after
Iranian troops have captured them.
   The Iranians, at war with Iraq since September 1980, said 5,000
civilians and some Iranian soldiers were killed, and another 5,000
people were wounded. They claimed the Iraqis dropped chemical bombs
because the Kurds, long in rebellion against Iraq, welcomed their
``liberators.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency also said Thursday
that Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on villages in the
Marivan border region of northwest Iran earlier in the day, killing
several people.
   After months of international criticism for failing to comply
with a cease-fire resolution the U.N. Security Council passed last
summer, Iran is making all the mileage possible from the claims of
chemical warfare.
   Tehran's official press has likened the alleged Iraqi use of gas
bombs in Kurdistan to the Americans dropping atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, and demanded international
condemnation of Iraq. Iraq has denied the claims.

   An Iranian gunboat was seized last weekend by
Oman after an incident at sea during which the boat's skipper was
killed in an apparent mutiny, Pentagon officials said Thursday.
   The officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not
identified, said a lone surviving Iranian crewman remained in Omani
custody and that the body of the gunboat's skipper had been
recovered.
   The sources stressed that details of the incident were still
sketchy, primarily because the Omani government had yet to share
much information.
   But the officials said it appeared the captain was shot and
killed by the surviving crewman after tossing a second crewman
overboard to his death.
   A preliminary intelligence report suggests the altercation began
when the two crewmen refused the captain's order to mount an attack
on a nearby commercial ship, one source added.
   The officials said it remained unclear whether the Iranian
survivor had purposely motored toward Oman after the incident or
simply had become disoriented. In either event, he was intercepted
by an Omani patrol vessel and taken into custody sometime over the
weekend, the sources said.
   The officials stressed the Pentagon was not attaching any
particular significance to the mutiny by suggesting, for example,
it demonstrated widespread discord within Iran's military.
   ``We think it's an isolated incident,'' said one source. ``But
we think it's an interesting isolated incident.''
   As recounted by the sources, the affair occurred aboard a
Swedish-built Boghammer patrol boat. Those vessels are about 43
feet long and have been modified by Iran to carry machine guns and
other weapons, and used extensively for attacks on Persian Gulf
shipping.
   ``As best we can piece together, the two crewmen refused an
order to mount an attack,'' said one source. ``So the skipper threw
one of them overboard. At that point, the second crewman shot the
skipper. Then he either took the boat to Oman or else got lost.''

   A Canadian military jet having problems
with its oxygen system made an emergency landing Thursday at
Charleston's Yeager Airport after the pilot became dizzy, officials
said.
   The airport director said the single-seat F-A-18 and another
traveling with it landed safely at 4 p.m. The pilot, who was not
immediately identified, was treated at the scene and was reported
to be OK.
   Jeff Bubar, the airport manager, said one jet experienced
problems with its liquid oxygen supply and the pilot was forced to
seek the nearest airport with military facilities.
   ``The pilot was having problems with his oxygen system and was
feeling lght-headed and having problems breathing and decided to
put it down,'' said Robert Greter of the Civil Air Patrol.
   Greter said the jets carry liquid oxygen that is coverted into
gas.
   ``He didn't faint. He just felt slightly ill,'' said Dr. Jerill
Cavender, who treated the pilot.
   Cavender said the pilot was flying at 33,000 feet when the
system apparently had problems converting the liquid into gas.
   Randy Clark, air traffic control supervisor for the Federal
Aviation Administration, said the planes were en route from Florida
to Canada on a training flight.
   The West Virginia Air National Guard, which maintains facilities
at Yeager Airport, refused to comment.
   Firefighters late Thursday afternoon still were keeping an eye
on the slate-gray, 75-foot-long planes parked on a corner of the
tarmac.
   The twin-engine attack jet, known as the Hornet, was built by
McDonnell-Douglas Corp. The planes that landed in Charleston
appeared to have missiles beneath each wing, but it was not clear
whether they were live.
   The plane is designed primarily for air-to-air combat and for
air-to-ground bombings.
   One plane was decorated with an Indian and crossed tomahawks on
one of its two tailfins, and the other was decorated with a
saber-tooth tiger.

<HEAD>Mulroney Shuffles Cabinet In Pre-Election Buildup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced a major
Cabinet shuffle Thursday, bringing in an old school friend and
changing the key trade and immigration portfolios.
   ``This puts us in fighting trim for an election, when it
comes,'' the prime minister said.
   Mulroney is expected to call an election this fall or early in
1989, well before the August 1989 end of his Progressive
Conservative Party's five-year term. Canadian governments
traditionally call early elections when their popularity ratings
are high.
   The most important change was the post of minister for
international trade.
   The combative incumbent, Pat Carney, was transferred to
presidency of the Treasury Board, which had been held by Deputy
Prime Minister Don Mazankowski.
   Transport Minister John Crosbie, an affable Newfoundlander noted
for his witty ripostes in the House of Commons, took over at trade.
   He will have the task of winning Parliament's approval of the
free-trade agreement reached with the United States last year and
selling the country on the 10-year deal.
   At least two of Canada's 10 provinces, including powerful
Ontario, oppose the treaty, which would dismantle tariffs and
loosen other barriers in the world's largest trading partnership.
   Once a contender for the Conservative leadership, Crosbie
favored free trade long before Mulroney was converted to the
concept. Referring to his reputation as a somewhat of a renegade,
Crosbie told reporters: ``I certainly want to be a cannon (but) not
a loose one.''
   The biggest surprise in the reshaping of the 38-member Cabinet
was Mulroney's decision to bring in an old friend from his student
days at Laval University, Lucien Bouchard.
   Bouchard, the Canadian ambassador to France since 1985, was
named secretary of state and a member of the inner Cabinet as
Mulroney attempted to shore up support in Quebec province following
a series of scandals involving provincial ministers.
   Bouchard is a former supporter of the separatist Parti Quebecois
and voted in favor of autonomy for the province, dominated by
French-speakers, in a 1980 referendum. The referendum was defeated,
and Bouchard eventually joined the Conservative camp.
   ``I have to prove it is possible to be both a Canadian and a
Quebecer,'' Bouchard said Thursday after new Cabinet members were
sworn in by Governor General Jeanne Sauve in Ottawa.
   A lawyer from Chicoutimi, Bouchard is not a member of Parliament
but can serve in the Cabinet pending the next by-election for an
empty seat from Quebec. He replaces David Crombie who resigned
Wednesday to head a commission on the development of the Lake
Ontario waterfront.
   Employment and Immigration Minister Benoit Bouchard and his
deputy, Gerry Weiner, were both shifted from a department that has
been criticized by the opposition for the influx of illegal aliens
into Canada, estimated at 2,000 per month. Bouchard takes over as
transport minister, while Weiner becomes minister of state for
multiculturalism.
   The Bouchards are not related.
   The new immigration minister is Barbara McDougall, formerly in
charge of privatization. Her deputy is Monique Vezina, who moves
from supply and services.
   Foreign Minister Joe Clark and Finance Minister Michael Wilson
kept their jobs.
   The latest polls show the Conservatives have rebounded this year
from their third-place standing over the last two years.
   Thanks to strong economic growth and a drop in unemployment to
7.8 percent _ a seven-year low _ the Conservatives are
neck-and-neck with the main opposition Liberal Party and socialist
New Democratic Party.

   Hog farmers continue to expand production, an
Agriculture Department report showed Thursday.
   As of March 1, the inventory of hogs and pigs in the 10 major
pork states totaled an estimated 40.5 million head, up 6 percent
from both a year ago and two years ago, the report said.
   The number of breeding hogs was up 4 percent and 10 percent from
March 1 of 1987 and 1986, respectively, to 5.42 million head. That
indicated further production increases in the months ahead.
   Officials said the March 1 inventory of market hogs _ animals
headed for slaughter and the consumer market _ totaled 35.1 million
head, up 6 percent and 5 percent from the previous two years.
   The pig crop during the winter months of December, January and
February was 15.8 million head, up 6 percent from the same period
of 1986-87, the report said, and 11 percent more than in the winter
of two years ago.
   Looking a future prospects, the report said hog farmers surveyed
intend to have 2.4 million sows give birth in the March-May period,
2 percent more than a year ago and 11 percent more than the actual
farrowings of two years ago.
   The 10 leading hog states account for about 79 percent of the
nation's pork. The following list shows the March 1 inventory. The
first number, in thousands, is the total number of hogs in the
state, the second is the March 1 figure's percentage of a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Soviets Buy Another 100,000 Tons of U.S. Corn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sovet Union has bought an additional
101,600 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement between the two countries, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 101,600 tons of
corn would be about 4 million bushels.
   Corn prices recently have been averaging about $1.90 per bushel
at the farm level, meaning the sale could have a farm value of
around $7.6 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought 4.1
million tons of corn, plus more than 7.48 million tons of wheat;
818,400 tons of soybeans, and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

   The Assemblies of God state council that
wanted Jimmy Swaggart barred from preaching for three months will
meet Friday and may endorse the harsher penalty demanded by the
church's national leaders, a member said Thursday.
   The TV evangelist had cited the Louisiana District Council's
recommendation for a three-month ban when he said through his
lawyer Wednesday that he would defy the Assemblies national
leadership's order that he step down for a year.
   Swaggart stepped down from the pulpit Feb. 21 after tearfully
confessing to an undisclosed sin. A prostitute has said Swaggart
paid her to pose nude for him.
   Risking dismissal by national church leaders, Swaggart plans to
return to preaching May 22, three months after he stepped down,
said his lawyer, Bill Treeby.
   Juleen Turnage, national Assemblies of God spokeswoman at the
church's headquarters in Springfield, Mo., said the Louisiana
district presbytery would meet in Baton Rouge on Friday to discuss
Swaggart's case. She said she had no other details and the national
office did not plan to send a representative.
   The Rev. Ansley Orfila of Slidell, La., one of 19 members of the
Louisiana council, said there was little the council could do to
challenge the penalty imposed by the national body. He said
Swaggart probably will leave the denomination.
   Referring to the church's national leaders, Orfila told the
Springfield (Mo.) News-Leader: ``The executive presbytery may not
have the right to discipline him, but they have the power. I don't
think we'll meet to defy them. Maybe it will be just to decide how
to handle things.''
   Contacted Thursday, Orfila confirmed what he told the newspaper
but declined to comment further.
   State church officials decided to meet Friday after discussing
the case in a telephone conference call, the newspaper said. The
call was made shortly after the church's national officials
announced Tuesday that they had rejected the three-month ban as too
lenient.
   The Rev. Forrest Hall, secretary-treasurer of the Louisiana
District Council, said the state church will probably wind up
supporting the national recommendation. ``But the men of the
district are independent-minded,'' he told the News-Leader.
   Gus Weill, a spokesman for Swaggart, said Thursday he was
unaware of any meeting by the district council.
   Meanwhile, one of Swaggart's fellow ministers said that Swaggart
claimed evangelist Oral Roberts had cast demons out of him and that
Swaggart's feeling of being released from sin might have played a
role in his decision to return to the pulpit this spring.
   But a spokesman for the Tulsa, Okla.-based evangelist said
Roberts did not recommend Swaggart's immediate return to the pulpit.
   ``If anyone is to report that Oral Roberts is recommending that
Jimmy Swaggart defy the Assembly of God ruling from Springfield,
that is not accurate,'' said Roberts' son Richard. ``My dad had
nothing to do with his decision. We believe that that is a matter
that Jimmy Swaggart must make his own decision and follow the
leading of God.''
   The Rev. Mike Evans, pastor of the Church on the Move in Euless,
Texas, said Wednesday that while he was visiting Baton Rouge in
February, Swaggart told him of Roberts' prayer.
   ``Oral Roberts called him up and told him that he saw demons
with long fingernails digging the flesh into Jimmy Swaggart's body
and he cast those demons out of his body,'' said Evans. ``I think
this explains some of the rationale behind Jimmy's decision to
return to television after three months.''

<HEAD>Toni Morrison and Her ``Beloved'' Are Redeemed</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Pulitzers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES A. BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Toni Morrison felt ``kind of a redemption'' when
she won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her spellbinding and
searing song of slavery, ``Beloved.''
   ``I thought it was quite possible that the value of the book
would not be allowed to be the only consideration that the
(Pulitzer) committee would have to consider, and that saddened
me,'' Morrison said Thursday.
   The editor, playwright and author had been the epicenter of a
literary earthquake and controversy.
   After ``Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or
the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers
and critics signed a statement deploring the celebrated writer's
lack of recognition.
   Morrison's ``Song of Solomon'' did win the National Book Critics
Circle Award for 1977, but the two other awards are considered more
prestigious.
   The statement, published as an open letter in the New York Times
Book Review in January, was signed by such literary figures as the
writers Maya Angelou, Amiri Baraka, John Williams and John Edgar
Wideman, the poet June Jordan and critic Henry Louis Gates Jr.
   ``Beloved,'' they said, was ``a gift to our community, our
country, our conscience.''
   The statement said Morrison ``has yet to receive the national
recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely deserve.''
   Although Morrison said she didn't know a campaign was being
mounted on her behalf, when she read the letter, she felt wonderful.
   ``It says you're valuable to us. It doesn't say you're flawless;
it just says we esteem you. It's kind of obit information _ the
kind of thing you never expect.''
   However, Morrison said she was hurt by charges that she had
manipulated other writers.
   ``The only manipulations are between the covers of the book,''
she said. ``There was an article some one read to me on the phone
about `affirmative- action prizes.' That's depressing.
   ``Somebody told me that I should simply come out and declare
that I did not want the Pulitzer,'' she continued. ``So I dismissed
all of it very happily from my mind until today. And I had genuine
astonishment that the committee made a decision on the merits of
the book.''
   The fiction committee consisted of Julian Moynahan, critic and
professor of English at Rutgers University; critic Richard Eder, a
former Pulitzer winner; and the writer Alice Adams.
   Moynahan said the jurors made their recommendations six weeks
before the letter was published and felt no pressure to recommend
Morrison's book.
   ``I think her book is one of the greatest American novels I've
ever read in my life,'' he said.
   The best-selling ``Beloved,'' published by Knopf, is partly
based on a true account of an escaped slaved named Margaret Garner
who decided to kill her child rather than see her returned to
bondage. It was a chilling choice faced by many during the horrors
of slavery; many Africans chose suicide in the Atlantic during the
crossing on slave ships, and others killed their children or wives
before leaving the continent.
   In language rich and riveting, Morrison tells the tale of Sethe,
who escapes from Kentucky and struggles to survive in post-bellum
Ohio in a house haunted by her dead baby.
   The 57-year-old Morrison, who grew up in Lorain, Ohio, had heard
the Garner story and found herself curious and puzzled by the woman
herself.
   ``In spite of all the political furor about her, the woman was
elusive,'' the writer said. ``She was described always as being so
serene, so calm. But she said very little. The mystery was not the
situation but what goes on inside a woman like that; what was she
feeling?''
   Morrison, a former Random House editor whose other works include
the novels ``Tar Baby'' and ``Song of Solomon,'' and the play
``Dreaming Emmett,'' said ``Beloved'' is the best writing she's
ever done.

   Democratic front-runners Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson
sharply attacked the Reagan administration on Thursday as they
pointed toward next week's primary showdown in Wisconsin. The White
House said President Reagan was ready to begin working for George
Bush, the Republican nominee-to-be.
   Democratic hopeful Albert Gore aimed his fire at his party
rivals, saying that Dukakis was ``afraid to say a single word about
Jesse Jackson.'' Gore said he would continue to criticize Jackson,
adding he intended to treat him like he would any other combatant
in the race.

   Dukakis, criticized for campaigning in an aloof manner, served
lunch at a senior citizen center and then served up a stinging up
attack on the Reagan administration in an evening speech.
   ``This administration has walked away from the American dream,''
he said. ``I'm running for president because during the past seven
years I've seen too many people thrown out into the streets after
decades on the job...and I've talked to too many local leaders
who've seen their communities become ghost towns of boarded up
hopes and foreclosed dreams.''

   Jackson called on embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese to
resign. ``It is not a question of guilt or innocence. He simple
cannot fulfill the requirements of the job,'' Jackson said.
   ``Ed Meese deserves due process. We deserve an attorney
general,'' he said, referring to Meese's troubled legal situation
and recent resignations by high Justice Department aides.
   On the Republican side, Bush and his aides were looking ahead to
general election strategy, and GOP sources said one serious
possibility was for Treasury Secretary James Baker III to resign
and oversee the campaign.
   Baker was Bush's campaign manager in his unsuccessful 1980 run.
   In contrast, Democrats were still trying to clear up their muddy
nomination picture.
   Gore defended his own criticism of Jackson and characterized
Dukakis as timid on the same score as the Democratic field pointed
toward Wisconsin, next way station on the campaign marathon.
   Suellen Albrecht, the state party chairwoman, said either
Jackson or Dukakis figures to win in her state. But Gore began
running a television commercial attacking Chrysler Corp. Chairman
Lee Iacocca for closing a plant in Wisconsin, and Sen. Paul Simon
was campaigning in what could be his last stand.
   Dukakis and Jackson were in a close race for the lead in
national convention delegates, although neither man had even a
third of the 2,082 needed to win the nomination.
   Jackson's victory in the Michigan caucuses last week elevated
him to the front rank of the race, to the dismay of some party
officials who fear his race and liberal positions would lead to a
massive Democratic defeat in the fall if he should be nominated.
   Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, a Jackson supporter, told a Capitol
Hill news conference that there is evidence of a ``Stop Jesse
Movement'' forming among Southern Democrats _ and he saw a certain
irony in that.
   ``I would suggest to you that the people involved in this effort
are probably people who did not want to see a Mike Dukakis or Jesse
Jackson in this race. ... They're now coalescing behind a Mike
Dukakis candidacy,'' he said.
   There is no question that Jackson has been the talk of the race
since his stunning Michigan landslide last Saturday.
   Gore, who picked up the endorsement of the Milwaukee Sentinel on
Thursday, has criticized Jackson in recent days for lacking
experience and for associating in the past with PLO Leader Yasser
Arafat and Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   He said he was holding Jackson to the same standard as he would
any other politician, and added that Dukakis ``is afraid to say a
single word about Jesse Jackson.''
   Jackson spent the day foraging for votes in Wisconsin, and he
told an audience of high school students that it is not always the
elected officials who lead the drive for change.
   ``The reality is that this drive for social justice, this drive
for equal protection under the law was led by young America. I was
part of the generation, of that leadership. I learned to lead by
heading a student body as a college student,'' he said.
   Jackson picked up an endorsemnent from Richard Congdon, an
attorney who headed Richard Gephardt's now-defunct campaign in
Wisconsin.
   And he got some kind words from withdrawn candidate Gary Hart.
The one-time front-runner in the race said Jackson's campaign has
been sending a message to the party's leaders that the voters are
dissatisfied with politics as usual.
   ``Jesse is as much a messenger to the party leaders as a bearer
of his own message,'' Hart said in an interview with the Denver
Post. The former Colorado senator also said he has advised Jackson
to deliver a series of speeches on the budget deficit, education,
military reform and other issues _ and added that he was ``more
than prepared'' to help himn write them.
   Among the Republicans, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
did not say when Reagan would begin campaigning for Bush. But he
said the situation that once led the president to declare his
neutrality in the GOP race had changed following Sen. Bob Dole's
withdrawal from the campaign.
   Pat Robertson is Bush's only active challenger, but Fitzwater
noted that the former television evangelist ``recognizes the
realities of the situation.''

   Former presidential aide Lyn Nofziger should
be imprisoned for illegally lobbying the White House because he
flouted the law and compared his offense to ``running a stop
sign,'' a prosecutor said Thursday in court papers.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay said in a sentencing memo
that remarks Nofziger made following his conviction Feb. 11 showed
``a total lack of remorse or contrition'' about violating the
Ethics in Government Act's ban on lobbying former colleagues less
than a year afte leaving government service.
   Nofziger, 63, should be fined and imprisoned to ``impress
present and former government employees, as well as the general
public, that Congress intended those restrictions to be taken
seriously and that they will be enforced with meaningful
penalties,'' McKay said in the memo filed with U.S. District Judge
Thomas A. Flannery.
   Minutes after the verdict, Nofziger stood outside the U.S.
Courthouse and called the ethics statute ``a lousy law.'' He also
said, ``I don't think I did anything wrong'' and compared the
offense to ``running a stop sign.''
   Nofziger, President Reagan's former political director, repeated
his profession of innocence in a Feb. 18 letter to the court that
was quoted in the prosecution brief. ``I have never thought, and I
do not think today, that I am guilty morally, ethically or legally
of the crimes of which I am convicted,'' he wrote.
   McKay said ``that intransigent attitude is a consideration
arguing in favor of a sentence that includes a period of
incarceration.''
   The sentencing is scheduled for April 8.
   ``To request jail time for a 63-year-old man with a spotless
record of public service who did not intend to violate the law is
ridiculous, unnecessary and totally lacking in compassion,'' said
defense lawyer E. Lawrence Barcella.
   McKay said Nofziger also ignored the advice of lawyers he
consulted about the ethics law when he left Reagan's staff in early
1982 to form a consulting business with Mark A. Bragg.
   The prosecution brief recounted an incident in which Nofziger
uttered a profanity when one of the attorneys, Martin L. Artiano,
advised him not to make any White House contacts without first
contacting the law firm.
   During the trial, associate independent counsel Merrick Garland
related the episode to the judge during a bench conference out of
hearing of the jury and the public, according to the trial
transcript.
   Garland told the judge that after responding with the profanity,
Nofziger said, ``These are my friends and I am going back to them
if I want to.''
   McKay noted in the sentencing memo that Nofziger's defense
lawyers have ``attempted to minimize the significance of this
episode by asserting that defendant Nofziger's profanity ... was
characteristic of their client's jocularity.''
   ``Perhaps so,'' McKay wrote, ``but his lawyers at the time took
the incident seriously. They have told staff members of the
independent counsel that this episode caused concern'' within the
law firm.
   ``Whatever his choice of words, however, it is evident that
defendant Nofziger was alerted to and deliberately chose to ignore
written and oral advice that Section 207(c) (of the ethics law)
applied to him,'' McKay said.
   ``Lyn doesn't recall ever having such a conversation,'' Barcella
said. Artiano only recalled it after ``a lot of prompting'' during
``repeated interviews with the independent counsel and numerous
sessions with the grand jury,'' Barcella said.
   ``Even Artiano has said Lyn was joking when he said it and
thereafter Lyn came and asked for their advice about Ethics in
Government Act matters,'' Barcella said.
   Flannery did not allow the defense to argue during the trial
that Nofziger acted with advice of legal counsel when he lobbied
the White House.
   Nofziger could be sentenced to up to two years in prison and
fined up to $10,000 on each of three counts of illegally lobbying
the White House on behalf of Wedtech Corp., a maritime engineers'
union and the manufacturer of the Air Force's A-10 anti-tank plane.
   McKay did not make a specific recommendation about the length of
the prison term but said Nofziger should be fined cumulatively for
each of the three convictions.
   ``Nofziger's special entree to the most powerful officials in
government, including the president himself, epitomized the very
danger to public perception about the integrity of governmental
decision-making that motivated Congress to enact the one-year
no-contact prohibition,'' the prosecutor said.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Jesse Jackson called Thursday
for the resignation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III and said,
``It is not a question of guilt or innocence. He simply cannot
fulfill the requirements of the job.''
   The presidential hopeful, a longtime critic of President
Reagan's Justice Department, said he is ``appalled at the state of
emergency'' there. He blamed the problems on Reagan's tolerance of
what he called a low moral tone in the administration.
   ``Justice is the jugular vien of democracy. With justice, almost
everything is possible,'' Jackson told at rally of about 2,000 at
the Sheboygan Armory. ``Without justice, almost nothing is
possible.''
   Jackson said Meese must go because he is being consumed
defending himself against allegations of wrongdoing. The candidate
called the recent resignations of top Justice officials ``a
national disgrace'' because, he said, they left ``rather than have
their reputations sullied in association with the attorney
general.''
   To an enthusiastic, mostly white crowd which cheered his attacks
on Meese, Jackson said:
   ``Increasingly, the administration of justice is being
sacrificed to the defense of the attorney general. ... This is not
a question of the shameful prospect of an attorney general who
spends more time in court as a defendant than as a prosecutor.''
   The attorney general must take the lead in shaping national
policies to cut drug traffic and reduce crime, activities that
simply take a great deal of time, Jackson argued.
   ``It is not a question of guilt or innocence. He simply cannot
fulfill the requirements of the job. Ed Meese deserves due process.
We deserve an attorney general,'' he said.
   Jackson said Meese will probably not resign, so Reagan must ask
him to leave.
   ``Today in Washington, once again there is a leadership vacuum
in this collapsing administration,'' Jackson said. ``Ed Meese does
not have the judgment to submit his resignation. The president does
not exercise leadership to ask for it. The vice president _ now
leader of his party _ does not have the strength to get the
president to act,'' Jackson said. ``So the nation must depend _
once again _ on Mrs. Reagan.''
   Then, taking the line from Mrs. Reagan's drug campaign, the
Democrat added: ``When Mr. Meese asks Mr. Reagan whether he should
stay on, Mrs. Reagan should advise him, `Just say no.'''
   Jackson would not respond directly to attacks from fellow
Democratic candidate Sen. Albert Gore Jr. on his lack of
govermental experience. But the civil rights activist did so by
implication.
   ``Some officeholders are not leaders,'' he said in Sheboygan.
``All leaders are not officeholders.''
   At Pulaski High School in the heart of Southside Milwaukee,
Jackson talked to 2,000 students about the nature of leadership.
   He detailed major civil rights achievements _ the Civil Rights
Act, voting rights, open housing _ and then talked about who was
responsible.
   ``These rich achievments are in some elected officials' resumes,
but the reality is that this drive for social justice, this drive
for equal protection under the law was led by young America. I was
part of the generation, of that leadership,'' he said.
   Southside Milwaukee was the site of sometimes violent
confrontations during the 1960s as activists marched into all-white
neighborhoods to support open housing laws. Jackson received a warm
welcome from the mostly white crowd.
   In Washington, Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas, who said Wednesday
he believes a ``stop Jesse'' movement is afoot, told a news
conference that ``while there is evidence that a movement aimed at
stopping Jesse has been mounted by Jackson detractors, we have not
yet identified exactly who they are.''
   Leland speculated that ``the architects of Super Tuesday are
behind this.''
   Jackson picked up the endorsement of Richard Congdon, a Waukesha
lawyer who headed Richard Gephardt's campaign in the state.
   Jackson is on the air in Wisconsin with a $40,000 television
buy, said campaign manager Gerald Austin.

   The Charlotte Observer on Thursday won the 1988
Pulitzer Prize for public service for its coverage of the PTL
financial scandal that brought down Jim and Tammy Bakker and
created turmoil in televangelism.
   The North Carolina paper, the Wall Street Journal and The Miami
Herald each took two of the awards.
   In its citation for the public service award, one of six
Pulitzers awarded to Knight-Ridder papers, the prize board said the
Observer revealed misuse of funds by the ministry ``through
persistent coverage conducted in the face of a massive campaign by
PTL to discredit the newspaper.''
   The other prize-winning Knight-Ridder papers are The
Philadelphia Inquirer, the Herald, and the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch.
   In the arts, novelist Toni Morrison _ whose failure to win other
writing awards over the past year caused a literary controversy _
received the Pulitzer for fiction for her novel ``Beloved.''
``Driving Miss Daisy'' by Alfred Uhry and ``The Making of the
Atomic Bomb'' by Richard Rhodes won the prizes for drama and
general non-fiction, respectively.
   Winners reacted gleefully to the news. ``I'm in a state of
slack-jawed dumbfoundedness,'' said Tom Shales of the Washington
Post, who won the criticism award for his writings on television.
   Tim Weiner of the Inquirer celebrated his national reporting
award _ for a series of reports on a secret Pentagon budget used to
sponsor defense research and an arms buildup _ by climbing on a
desk and lighting up a stogie, while listening to his colleagues'
applause.
   Weiner said he felt as if he had just received a ``$10 million
check from Ed McMahon. I'm just a very happy guy and very lucky.''
   Pulitzers for general news reporting went to the Alabama Journal
of Montgomery for an investigation of the state's unusually high
infant mortality rate, and to the Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune
for stories that showed flaws in the Massachusetts prison furlough
system.
   The Chicago Tribune's Dean Baquet, William Gaines and Ann Marie
Lipinski won the Pulitzer for investigative reporting for stories
on ``the self-interest and waste that plagued Chicago's City
Council.''
   Daniel Hertzberg and James B. Stewart of the Wall Street Journal
won the Pulitzer for explanatory journalism for stories about an
investment banker charged with insider trading and about the day
after the October stock market crash. The Journal's other Pulitzer
_ for specialized reporting _ went to Walt Bogdanich for a series
on faulty testing by medical laboratories.
   Thomas L. Friedman of The New York Times won the Pulitzer for
international reporting for what the Pulitzer board termed
``balanced and informed coverage of Israel.'' Friedman also won a
Pulitzer for international reporting in 1983.
   The Miami Herald's two awards came in commentary and feature
photography. Dave Barry won the former for what the board called
``consistently effective use of humor as a device for presenting
fresh insights into serious concerns''; Michel duCille won the
latter for photographs of the decay and rehabilitation of a housing
project with a cocaine problem.
   Other journalism awards included:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Feature writing, to Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul Pioneer
Press Dispatch for her series about the life and death of an AIDS
victim in a farm community.
   _Editorial writing, to Jane Healy of The Orlando Sentinel for
editorials that protested overdevelopment of Florida's Orange
County.
   _Editorial cartooning, to Doug Marlette of the Atlanta
Constitution and the Charlotte Observer.
   _Spot news photography, to Scott Shaw of the Odessa (Texas)
American for his pictures of little Jessica McClure being rescued
from the well into which she had fallen.
   Winners are selected by the Pulitzer board, which is guided but
not limited by a series of finalists submitted by nominating juries
in various categories.
   The Alabama Journal's investigation of infant mortality was
entered in the public service category, where it was a finalist,
but the board awarded it the prize for general news.
   Weiner's series on the Pentagon budget was entered in
explanatory journalism and national reporting. It was chosen a
finalist by the explanatory jury, but the board gave it a Pulitzer
for national reporting.
   Other arts awards included:

<TEXT>
   A sophisticated, ultralight aircraft run
by human power made six successful test flights Thursday preparing
for a record distance attempt inspired by the 3,500-year-old Greek
myth of Daedalus.
   The record attempt was to be made Friday, but organizers of the
3-year-old, $1 million project postponed the flight until the
weekend because gusts of up to 30 mph are expected Friday.
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology project is aimed at
breaking the world record for human-powered flight over the 74-mile
distance from Crete to the island of Santorini, also known as Thira.
   Thursday's test flights each lasted less than three minutes in
calm dawn weather above a Greek air force base next to Iraklion
airport.
   Flight Director Steve K. Bussulari, an MIT aerospace expert,
told reporters the 68-pound Daedalus 88 ``is in good shape ... and
we may see favorable conditions'' for a flight Saturday or Sunday.
   Five pilots _ four Americans and a Greek _ took turns pedaling
the pink-and-silver ultralight at speeds of about 14 mph, flying
about 15 feet above the tarmac.
   The craft is named in honor of the mythical inventor Daedalus,
who tried with his son Icarus to escape from Crete on wings made of
feathers and wax. Daedalus succeeded, but Icarus flew too near the
sun, the wax melted and he fell into the sea.
   The record flight requires temperatures below 70 degrees and
almost dead calm.
   Conditions appeared perfect Thursday following nine days of
blustery weather.
   Frank Scioscia, 27, a professional cyclist from Scranton, Pa.,
reported, ``It feels like a day for the record, pretty calm. I was
flying the plane with no hands.''
   But Bussulari noted that Daedalus 88 would have run into strong
headwinds about five miles off Santorini and that in any case, ``We
felt we needed a test flight to shake down the airplane.''
   The pilots are taking turns standing by in readiness for the
flight. The pilot who had been scheduled to fly Friday was Greg
Zack, 26, of Wilmington, N.C., whose father was born in Greece.
   The pilot pumps bicycle pedals that turn the ultralight's
propeller. He uses a joystick to steer the plane, coordinating with
ground-based radio instructions.
   ``For the record the pilot must keep pedaling a steady 15 mph
but the effort is equivalent to riding 23 miles an hour on land,''
said Glenn Tremml, a medical student from New Haven, Conn.
   Tremml set the 37.2-mile world record for human-powered flight
in California in 1987, flying a Daedalus prototype.
   Two backup flying machines are ready if needed.
   All the craft are made of lightweight composite material _
graphite epoxy, plastic fiber and mylar, an extra-thin plastic skin
that covers the 112-foot wingspan.
   Its organizers said the Daedalus project has produced new
information on endurance and low altitude flying aerodynamics and
meteorology during its three years of development.
   Project director John S. Langford explained, ``The project does
have a research and educational application, particularly in human
physiology and aeronautics. The plane itself doesn't have any
practical application. It should be seen as a work of art.''

<TEXT>
   Israeli forces left their
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in south Lebanon Thursday
afternoon in pursuit of Lebanese communist guerrillas who tried to
infiltrate, police reported.
   They said three guerrillas were wounded in a 30-minute firefight
four miles into the foothills of Mount Hermon, north of the
security zone. A guerrilla who escaped told reporters in the
Syrian-policed town of Hasbaya there were at least four Israeli
casualties.
   Israeli authorities did not comment on the claim and it could
not be verified independently.
   Police said the eight-man guerrilla squad was caught trying to
infiltrate into the zone, which Israel established north of its
border in 1985 after withdrawing most of its occupation army from
south Lebanon.
   Two helicopter gunships strafed olive groves on Mount Hermon's
slopes as about 40 soldiers chased the fleeing guerrillas, police
said.
   Militiamen of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army left the
zone on Wednesday to attack Shiite Moslem guerrillas in the village
of Kfar Roumman, with the aid of Israeli gunships.
   Police said seven people, including two Shiite guerrillas, were
killed and 15 wounded in and around Kfar Roumman.

   The White House announced steps Thursday to
encourage American companies to withhold payments from Panama and
warned that mandatory action will be considered if the voluntary
measures are not sufficient.
   The action follows the disclosure that some American firms are
paying taxes and fees to Panama for doing business there,
undercutting the economic sanctions imposed by the United States to
force the ouster of strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Announcing the new action, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``we are giving U.S. companies and persons an
incentive and opportunity not to provide financial support to the
Noriega regime.
   ``Should these measures prove insufficient, we will review
additional legal steps that may be necessary to deny transfer of
funds to the Noriega regime from U.S. companies and persons,''
Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said U.S. government payments owed the government of
Panama will be deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.
The United States already is withholding canal fees, toll payments
and other funds. Fitzwater said withholding taxes for U.S. employes
in Panama and rental payments also will go in the new account.
   He also said the Justice Department will take part in legal
cases by private parties who owe debts to Panama, declaring
President Eric Delvalle is the legitimate leader of the country.
The U.S. Treasury Department will help establish an account for
payment of funds in these cases.
   Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service will issue guidance
explaining how tax credits can be claimed for Panamanian income
taxes paid into an account at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York,
instead of to the Noriega government.
   Fitzwater said he did know how much money would be involved by
the action, but estimated it could deprive Noriega of ``millions
and millions.''
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the Senate voted 92-1 to approve a
resolution urging President Reagan to act at once to cut off the
flow of dollars from U.S. corporations to the Noriega regime.
   Panama has received an infusion of an estimated $19 million in
quarterly tax revenues. About $5.5 million of that money reportedly
came from taxes and fees paid by U.S. companies doing business in
Panama.
   Texaco Inc. and Eastern Airlines confirmed they had made
payments to the Panamanian government and said they were a routine
part of their business there.
   Fitzwater said the administration understands the legal concerns
of the companies involved. ``I'm not trying to cast any blame or
concern upon them. That was the system. They've got their laws.
They've got things they've got to comply with and we're trying to
help them through changes in IRS regulation.''
   He played down the amount of money involved, saying it was not
significant.
   Asked if it was not a setback for U.S. efforts, Fitzwater said,
``It's a minor setback in the sense that one day there's zero
(money) and the next day there's something, but these are fairly
small payments in the total picture and are not going to solve Mr.
Noriega's very serious and long-term problem.''
   He said the administration was studying a plan by which the
companies would make tax payments into an account in the United
States controlled by President Eric Delvalle, who has been in
hiding since demanding Noriega's resignation.
   The United States continues to recognize Delvalle as the
legitimate head of Panama's government.
   The Senate resolution was introduced by Majority Leader Robert
C. Byrd of West Virginia.
   ``The use of these monies (paid by American companies) has
enabled Gen. Noriega to buy himself time and prolong himself in
power as he ruthlessly continues in his efforts to thwart the
democratic will of the people of Panama and crush the general
strike,'' Byrd said.
   The resolution urges Reagan to use his authority under the
Emergency Economic Powers Act ``to prevent future transfers to the
Noriega regime of currency and credit subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States.''
   It also urges Reagan to consider placing such funds into an
escrow account until Noriega is ousted and democratic rule restored
in Panama.
   Only Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., voted against the resolution.
He did not explain the reasons for his vote.
   In another legislative move, Sen. David Durenburger, R-Minn.,
introduced legislation to deny U.S. foreign tax credits to American
companies which have made tax payments to Noriega's regime.
   ``In effect, the U.S. taxpayer is not going to subsidize the
illegal Noriega government,'' Durenburger said.
   Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri said its payments covered
corporate income, sales and excise taxes due for March. He said the
company does not see any conflict with U.S. economic sanctions.
   ``We continue our operations in Panama based on normal
commercial considerations,'' Maneri said. ``We do not become
involved in any political activity in a host nation; we're just
doing business down there.''
   Eastern spokeswoman Virginia Sanchez said the airline paid about
$178,000 in cash for monthly operating fees, including navigational
aids, communications, airport rentals and landing fees.
   ``There is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary about these
payments,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, a group of 13 senators urged the administration to
make arrangements to help Panama's banking system resume normal
operations after Noriega's departure.
   In a letter to Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, the
senators suggested the Treasury use the resources of the Exchange
Stabilization Fund to provide the National Bank of Panama with a
line of credit for the Panamanian banking system.
   The senators said the funds should be made available only after
the United States government is satisfied that Panama acted to
eliminate the use of Panamanian banks ``by drug traffickers to
shield illegal activities.''
   The letter was signed by Sens. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis.;
Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Alfonse M.
D'Amato, R-N.Y.; Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.; Dave Durenberger,
R-Minn.; Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; John W.
Warner, R-Va.; Pete Wilson, R-Calif.; Christopher J Dodd, D-Conn.;
John F. Kerry, D-Mass.; and Bob Graham, D-Fla.

<HEAD>Senators Says They Will Suspend Arms to Saudis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of 31 senators urged the
administration Thursday to suspend all arms sales to Saudi Arabia
until the Arab kingdom withdraws the Chinese-made missiles deployed
in its desert.
   In a letter to Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the senators
asked the administration to reconsider its planned notification to
Congress of a $450 million support package for AWACS radar
surveillance planes. The money is for training and maintenance of
the sophisticated intelligence planes which the United States has
sold the Saudis.
   In light of recent revelations that Saudi Arabia is deploying
Chinese-made intermediate-range ballistic missiles with a range of
about 1,850 miles, ``we strongly believe that our current policy
toward arms sales to Saudi Arabia must be re-examined,'' the letter
said.
   ``In light of the tremendous threat to regional security, the
United States should reconsider any new arms sales to the kingdom
until this matter is fully resolved and the Chinese missiles are
withdrawn,'' the senators wrote.
   They also urged the administration to ``make unequivocable its
absolute opposition to the presence of the Chinese missiles, which
represent a new and grave threat to the peace of the region.''
   Shultz will be meeting with Saudi officials in Riyadh next week
during a shuttle mission to the Mideast which begins Sunday. He
will be lobbying for Israeli-Arab peace talks, but is also expected
to bring up the Chinese missiles.
   Shultz already expressed U.S. concern about the sale of the
CSS-2 rockets to the Saudis when he spoke in Washington earlier
this month with China's Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian.
   The State Department has said it views the missiles as part of a
disturbing trend of missile proliferation in the gulf region and in
the Mideast.
   Saudi Arbia, an ally of Iraq's, says it needed the missiles to
protect itself in case of a further escalation in the Iran-Iraq
war, especially in view of Iranian threats.
   But U.S. officials say the Saudis bought the missiles in
frustration over repeated attempts by Congress to block American
arms sales.
   Saudi Arabia began negotiating the deal with the Chinese in
1985, after Congress blocked the sale of 48 F-15 jet fighters to
Saudi Arabia. Congress late last year agreed to sell the Saudis 24
F-15s in order to maintain Saudi air strength at its current levels.
   The CSS-2 rockets, which U.S. officials say are not yet
operational, also have a nuclear capability. But both China and
Saudi Arabia have assured the United States they do not intend to
arm the rockets with nuclear warheads.
   ``We are also deeply concerned that the Saudis hid the fact that
they possess these weapons,'' the letter said. Saudi Arabia
reportedly concealed from the United States the deal with China for
two years, before U.S. aerial intelligence photos exposed the deal.
   ``I am most concerned that our intelligence services were unable
to detect the acquisition of these missiles,'' said Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., in a letter to the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee. Helms called on Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., to hold
hearings about the missiles when Congress returns from Easter
recess next month.
   Helms said the committee must discuss, among other things,
``what this (intelligence) failure suggests about our government's
ability to detect'' intermediate-range nuclear missiles in the
Soviet Union. Helms is strongly opposed to the U.S.-Soviet treaty
which eliminates such missiles from both countries' arsenals.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebel Group Offers Direct Talks With Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola's main rebel movement called
Thursday for peace talks with the government of President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos to end a 13-year bush war.
   In a statement released in Lisbon, the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola said it was ``ready now to start
talks with the (governing party) without preconditions.''
   The note was signed by Jonas Savimbi, leader of the guerrillas,
who receive aid from South Africa and the United States. It said
the future of Angola ``depends on the will of all Angolans to free
themselves from foreign tutelage.''
   The note also said ``peace will come necessarily from direct
contact'' between the guerrilla group and the ruling Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola.
   The guerrillas have fought the government since losing a civil
war to the Popular Movement following Angola's independence from
Portugal in 1975. The insurgents have demanded a power-sharing
accord.
   Angolan government officials estimate more than 9,000 South
African troops are in southern Angola aiding the guerrillas. Soviet
advisers and approximately 40,000 Cuban troops aid the government
forces.
   The note said the guerrilla group ``categorically rejects all
fictitious interpretation of reconciliation in Angola by way of
amnesty, clemency or any so-called program of harmony.''
   The point was an apparent reference to reports Wednesday that
the government was willing to offer amnesty to the guerrillas if
South Africa and the United States halt all support for the
insurgents.
   The guerrilla proposal comes on the heels of discussions among
the United States, Angola, South Africa and Cuba on an end to
foreign aid to both sides.

   Church leaders said Thursday they are working with
the authorities to ease restrictions on religion in a society
dominated by atheists, but may fail unless clerical dissidents stop
causing trouble.
   Metropolitan Filaret of Kiev and Galitsky said the Rev. Gleb
Yakunin, a former political prisoner, and the Rev. Nikolai Gainov
were two of those in the Russian Orthodox church who seek ``to
press on us methods of solving our problems that would lead to
confrontation between church and state.''
   He described the dissidents as a small group of priests and lay
people.
   The church always has cooperated with the government, which is
dominated by the officially atheist Communist Party, but its
leaders say they want to moderate a 1929 law that requires
registration of religious groups and prevents charitable activities
and religious education of the young.
   Although they did not directly attack the law during a news
conference, their veiled criticisms appeared to be among the
strongest in years.
   Filaret stressed, however, that the church ``will continue to
use the same method of solving problems it has used in the whole
post-revolutionary period.''
   Last week, Yakunin called for the resignation of Patriarch
Pimen, 78, as head of the Russian Orthodox church on grounds he is
ill and senile.
   The priest also has criticized the willingness of church leaders
to subordinate themselves to the government, demanding greater
freedom to practice religion and publication of more religious
books.
   Yakunin was excluded from the ministry for 20 years, but
reinstated last year and assigned to a small parish outside Moscow.
   Contacted by telephone Thursday night, Yakunin said Filaret's
comments were moderate.
   ``Earlier they (church leaders) would have taken our work away
and imprisoned us. It's a sign of perestroika that they are willing
to listen to us,'' Yakunin said, referring to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's word for restructuring of society.
   Yakunin said he and Gainov are not seeking confrontation between
church and state but simply want to ``help the church improve its
situation.''
   ``We think church leaders are falling behind matters of
perestroika and want them to work more actively,'' he said.
   Filaret said the church has the right to discipline dissidents,
but ``we are urging them to use common sense and join with us to
solve the problems.''
   Archbishop Kiril of Smolensk said the government is rewriting
the 1929 law and consulting Russian Orthodox officials, but
described the consultations as a ``discussion of principle'' not
involving the text.
   Kiril said the law, adopted at the height of anti-religious
fervor after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, was no longer
appropriate for Soviet society.
   He said the replacement statute should be ready soon, but the
text was not complete and he could not provide details. The
archbishop said church officials were optimistic that it ``will
open the possibility for a fuller church life for all believers.''
   A list was revealed of nine people who will be made saints
during celebrations in June of the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity in what is now the Soviet Union.
   Metropolitan Yuvenali of Krutitsky and Kolomensky granted that
the list did not include anyone killed during the repression after
the revolution, as critics have demanded. He said study of the
issue would continue.
   Yuvenali accused the Russian Orthodox church that split away
after the revolution and now is based abroad of canonizing such
people for political purposes.
   Church officials said Patriarch Pimen participated in opening
and closing ceremonies and fulfilled his other obligations during a
three-day conference completed Thursday.

   A U.S. Air Force jet fighter slammed
into the middle of this small town and exploded Thursday, killing
the American pilot and at least one resident, injuring 16 people
and forcing scores to evacuate.
   ``The neighborhood looks like the bombed-out houses of World War
II,'' said Herbert Loef, a 52-year-old baker who lives down the
street from where the F-16 crashed into at least five homes.
   In Washington, Air Force spokesman Capt. Virginia Cody
identified the pilot as Lt. Thomas Edward Doyle, 24, of Oroville,
Calif. He entered active duty in May 1985 and had been at Hahn Air
Base since September 1987. He graduated from the Air Force Academy
in 1985.
   Wreckage was scattered over a wide area, and several hours after
the flames had been doused, black smoke still billowed from Forst,
a town of 6,000 people.
   Emergency crews evacuated more than 70 residents because the
plane was carrying a canister of hydrazine, which is used to
restart engines and which produces toxic gas when mixed with water.
Officials said there was no evidence of a gas leak.
   The plane crashed eight miles from a nuclear power plant, one
day after a French jet fighter crashed and exploded just a mile
from a nuclear plant in the West German state of Bavaria. The pilot
in that accident also was killed.
   The crashes sparked calls from members of West Germany's
opposition Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens party
for more restrictions on military training flights.
   Witnesses reported seeing smoke and flames pouring from the F-16
as it plunged toward Forst, about 60 miles south of Frankfurt. It
struck the roof of one house, tore off the front of another and set
several on fire, they said.
   Hilde Loef said her first thought when she saw the jet was, ``My
God, the planes are coming awfully low today.''
   ``Then I saw smoke and flames streaming out of the jet,'' she
said.
   The body of Theo Huber, 60, was found in the wreckage of his
home, officials said. Rescuers were searching for any other victims.
   Twelve firefighters were hospitalized for smoke inhalation, two
residents were treated for shock, and two more were being held for
observation in a hospital after apparently suffering smoke
inhalation, officials said.
   Authorities said the 10 a.m. disaster could have been far worse
had the plane crashed a couple of hours earlier, before residents
left for work.
   U.S. Air Force Maj. Gregory Smith told reporters at the scene
that an investigation into the cause of the crash was under way. He
said there was no live ammunition on the jet.
   The F-16 was part of the 50th Tactical Fighter Wing based at the
Hahn Air Base in the nearby Eifel Mountains, said Lt. Col. Edward
Neunherz, another Air Force spokesman.
   The crash occurred 185 miles west of Wednesday's crash of the
French jet fighter, which went down in the Bavarian village of Ohu
near the Isar nuclear plant.
   Environmentalists maintained the country had escaped disaster by
a ``split second,'' and the accident raised concerns about military
flights over nuclear power plants. But officials said the concrete
domes built over West German nuclear plants are designed to
withstand the force of a plane crash, so there was no danger of a
nuclear accident.

<TEXT>
   After hours of backroom negotiations
Thursday, the Arizona Senate let stand its dismissal of the third
and strongest impeachment charge against Gov. Evan Mecham.
   The decision not to reinstate the charge cleared the way for
final arguments Monday on two other counts against the first-term
Republican. Senators could vote Monday or Tuesday on whether he
should be removed from office.
   ``Is there any other matter to be taken up?'' asked Arizona
Chief Justice Frank X. Gordon as the senators convened in the late
afternoon after a day of caucuses and private meetings. Gordon's
question was answered with silence.
   Gordon then wished the Senate luck in reading and understanding
a thick stack of legal instructions given to them as they left for
the weekend.
   Mecham 63, is the first U.S. governor in six decades to face an
impeachment trial.
   On Wednesday, the Senate decided 16-12 to dismiss a charge that
he concealed a $350,000 campaign loan and to vote to convict or
acquit on two other charges _ that he tried to obstruct an
investigation of an alleged death threat by a staff member and that
he misused $80,000 from a protocol fund.
   The campaign loan charge was considered the strongest of the
three because there is more extensive documentation of what
occurred and because it is the only one that also has led to a
criminal indictment against Mecham.
   In contrast, the obstruction charge boils down in part to which
of two people to believe, and the other in part to technical
definitions of whether the $80,000 was public or private money.
   Several senators, in voting for dismissal, had said they feared
they would prejudice Mecham's criminal trial April 21 if they took
evidence on the last charge.
   Alan Stephens, Democratic minority leader, said Thursday neither
he nor the 10 other Democrats who voted for dismissal were willing
to reconsider.
   One of those who voted on the prevailing side would have had to
seek reconsideration for the matter to be reopened.
   ``There was a lot of backroom manipulating today,'' said
Stephens. ``People apparently made their decisions on the merits of
the arguments and that didn't change in 24 hours.''
   Only five of the 19 Senate Republicans supported the dismissal
of the last charge. Senate rules gave members 24 hours to rescind
any action.
   Stephens said his main concern was not letting the trial drag on
past Mecham's scheduled May 17 recall election. But some
Republicans argued that they were duty-bound to hear all the
evidence on all the charges.
   Republican Tony West complained angrily that the Democrats had
divided the impeachment proceeding along partisan lines for the
first time since it began Feb. 29. ``That action yesterday was
political roulette,'' he said.
   ``If there are not the votes to convict, and Gov. Mecham is back
on the ninth floor (in the governor's office) on Wednesday ... they
have dealt themselves a losing hand,'' West said.
   It would require a two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate to
convict Mecham. If he is convict, the Senate may then take a vote
to disqualify him from ever holding office again.

<HEAD>March Leaves Like a Lion in Colorado</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   March went out like a lion in much of Colorado on Thursday,
unloading more than 3 feet of snow, but the weather was more like
the proverbial lamb in much of the East and South.
   In south-central Colorado, 42 inches of snow were reported near
Rye by afternoon. Near Fort Collins in the northern part of the
state, Buckhorn Mountain logged 34 inches before noon, while
Bellevue recorded 27 inches.
   As the slow-moving storm continued to dump snow on the region,
the weather service issued a winter storm warning for blowing and
drifting snow and poor driving conditions as slush on roadways
turned to ice at nightfall.
   At Denver's Stapleton International Airport, crowded with
holiday weekend travelers, spokesman Norm Avery warned that delays
of two hours or more could be expected. Snowfall at midafternoon at
the airport was 8 inches.
   A winter storm watch was posted for northwestern Kansas, where
rain was expected to change to snow overnight and heavy snow was
possible Friday.
   Advisories for snow and blowing snow were posted for
southeastern Wyoming and the southern Nebraska Panhandle. By
midday, the Snowy Range Ski Area near Laramie, Wyo., reported 22
inches of snow.
   During the morning, high winds were reported in Utah, where
gusts reached 80 mph at Centerville.
   Elsewhere, a wind advisory continued in the mountains and
deserts of Southern California and in northwestern Arizona. A
freeze warning was posted for Thursday night for higher elevations
in southeastern Arizona.
   Skies were sunny in New England, and in much of the nation west
of the Rockies, while temperatures reached the 70s and occasionally
the 80s from Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast and in Southern
California.
   Early afternoon readings were in the 30s and 40s in the upper
Mississippi Valley, though, and were below freezing in the northern
Rockies.
   Rain extended from the southern half of the Great Plains to the
lower Ohio Valley, with thunderstorms mainly along the central Gulf
Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 16
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 84 degrees at Avon Park,
Fla., and Fort Myers, Fla. The early-morning low for the nation was
8 degrees below zero at Yellowstone Park.
   Heavier snowfall for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 4 inches at Denver and 3 inches at Pueblo, Colo. Heavier
rainfall included 0.68 inch at New Orleans; 0.46 inch at Memphis,
Tenn., and 0.45 inch at Jonesboro, Ark.
   The forecast for Friday called for snow in the central high
Plains and the central Rockies; showers and thunderstorms in the
southern Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee
Valley; rain showers from the central Plains across the lower Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic states, and fair to partly
sunny skies will prevail across the rest of the nation.
   Highs only in the 30s and 40s were forecast from northern New
Mexico and Arizona to Nebraska, and in the upper Mississippi Valley
and the upper Great Lakes; in the 60s and 70s in much of Oregon and
western Nevada, and across much of the southern tier of states and
the mid-Atlantic Coast; up to the low 80s in California, the lower
Rio Grande Valley and Florida, and in the 50s in most of the rest
of the nation.

   A former Conrail engineer sent to prison on
state charges in an Amtrak crash that killed 16 people was indicted
Thursday on federal charges including lying to investigators about
his drug use the day of the accident.
   Rick L. Gates, 33, of Essex, was charged with conspiracy,
obstruction of an agency investigation and making false statements,
said U.S. Attorney Breckinridge Willcox.
   The collision of the passenger train and three locomotives
operated by Gates was the worst accident in Amtrak history.
   The indictment alleges Gates lied under oath to National
Transportation Safety Board investigators after the Jan. 4, 1987,
crash near Chase, saying he had not consumed any drugs that day.
   Gates, however, shared a marijuana cigarette with brakeman
Edward Cromwell that day, according to the statement of facts read
into the record when he pleaded guilty in Baltimore County Circuit
Court on Feb. 17.
   The indictment also alleges Gates falsely testified about the
status of the signals he saw in the three Conrail locomotives and
along the tracks that day and about what pre-departure tests he
conducted.
   The conspiracy count alleges he joined with Cromwell to develop
a false story about what happened.
   Gates was the only person named in the indictment. If convicted,
Gates faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine
on each count.
   On Tuesday, Gates was sentenced to five years in prison and
fined $1,000 on a misdemeanor charge of manslaughter by locomotive.
   Sixteen people were killed and more than 170 others were injured
in the crash. Gates originally was charged with 16 counts, but
Gates agreed to a plea bargain, merging the names of all 16 victims
into a single count.
   Willcox said he had deferred any federal action against Gates
until the state prosecution had ended.
   ``Now that those charges have been resolved, it is appropriate
to vindicate the strong federal interest in ensuring that the
National Transportation Safety Board hearings are not obstructed by
those with the most direct and relevant information,'' the
prosecutor said.

   Supporters of slain judicial candidate
Julian Pierce asked Gov. Jim Martin on Thursday to convene a
special legislative session to allow another minority candidate to
seek the post.
   Martin was noncommittal after the closed meeting in his office.
He said he would consult with Pierce's former opponent, party and
legislative leaders and others, and expected to reach a decision
next week.
   Pierce, 42, a Lumbee Indian attorney, was shot to death Saturday
at his rural home in racially troubled Robeson County, where he was
running for a newly created Superior Court judgeship.
   At first, authorities said the killing looked like a political
assassination. But Tuesday they arrested a young Indian man and
said a second suspect committed suicide, and attributed Pierce's
killing to a romantic dispute.
   Pierce and Robeson County District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt,
who is white, were slated to meet in the May 3 Democratic primary.
   Under law, if a candidate dies more than 30 days after filing
for a primary has closed, his opponent wins the nomination. In this
case, there is no Republican in the race, so Britt would also
automatically win the general election in November.
   Supporters of Pierce asked for a special session to amend the
law to let another candidate enter the race.
   The governor, who planned to meet with Britt on Friday, told
reporters: ``I'm going to do my best to try to get input that I
need and then take a brief time to think about it very prayfully
and come up with the best answer that I can.''
   The new Superior Court judgeship was created under a law
intended to help a non-white candidate get elected in a county
where blacks and Indians make up 58 percent of the registered
voters.
   Two months ago, the Robesonian newspaper office was seized for
several hours by two Lumbees who said they wanted to call attention
to racial injustice and official corruption.
   Harvey Godwin, who was manager of Pierce's campaign, said that
was pleased with the discussion with the governor and that Martin
``listened to every word. ... I was impressed with him.''
   Pierce supporters have decided on a replacement candidate,
Godwin said, but he declined to identify the person.
   Britt has not commented on the special session question.
   Earlier, Martin said there was no reason to doubt that Pierce's
slaying resulted from a romantic dispute. He chided those who
continue to suggest otherwise, saying some want to stir up more
racial strife in Robeson County.
   ``There are people who want to take advantage of the problems
... and they're going to make up all kinds of theories,'' Martin
said.
   Sheriff Hubert Stone said John Goins, 24, killed Pierce and
later took his own life. Goins blamed Pierce for disrupting Goins'
relationship with the daughter of a woman Pierce was dating,
according to Stone.
   The other suspect, Sandy Gordon Chavis, is described as a
longtime friend of Goins.
   Martin said that Goins had left suicide notes and that there was
solid evidence linking him to the slaying.
   Vernon Bellecourt, a representative of the American Indian
Movement, said Wednesday that Goins' personal feelings ``could have
been manipulated by those that would have motives to see that
Julian Pierce was out of the way.''

   A bikini contest planned for Thursday
night by a University of Massachusetts fraternity to raise money
for charity was canceled hours before it was to begin after women
students threatened to picket.
   Joe Giarusso, assistant general manager of the off-campus Pink
Cadillac bar where the contest was to have been held, said the
makers of Miller Lite beer withdrew as sponsors.
   ``There are no prizes and the event has been canceled,'' he
said. He refused further comment.
   Women had earlier vowed to picket the bar, and 34 students had
signed a petition denouncing the contest organized by Delta Upsilon
as sanctioning ``ogling and girl watching.''
   Robert O'Brien, chairman of the fund-raising committee of Delta
Upsilon, said the contest was canceled ``because of a small, vocal
minority. We did not back down. It is our legal right to have the
contest.''
   Sue Madden, a UMass graduate student and an organizer of the
protest, was making placards for the demonstration when she learned
the contest was off.
   ``We're all stunned,'' she said. ``We're pleased that Miller
Lite was sensitive to this issue to help us achieve our cause.''
   ``Often women are reduced to their body parts in this society
and we don't think men have a right to judge us for our bodies,''
protester Becky Lockwood said earlier. ``This is objectifying women
to make money off us.''
   Delta Upsilon fraternity brothers said they didn't understand
the furor.
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said fraternity president Paul Kearney.
``Why should they be upset if it's a fund-raiser? They do it
everywhere else.'' He added: ``If they go to the beach, are they
going to call that sexist too?''
   O'Brien had said proceeds of the contest would be used by the
fraternity, which has $10 in its account, for its yearly beer keg
roll, a charity event that benefits the Jimmy Fund.
   The Jimmy Fund, the official charity of the Boston Red Sox,
raises money to fight cancer in children. Last year Delta Upsilon
raised $3,000 for the Jimmy Fund rolling empty beer kegs from
Boston 100 miles west to Amherst.
   The fraternity circulated fliers last week saying the bikini
contest was being presented by ``Delta Upsilon & The Jimmy Fund in
association with the Amherst Police'' department, but the event is
not sponsored by the Jimmy Fund.
   Jimmy Fund associate director Michael Rafferty said he asked the
fraternity not to use its name for the event.
   Police Chief Donald Maia, who had accepted an invitation to
emcee the contest, changed his mind over the weekend, saying he had
thought the contest was a beauty pageant.
   ``It's gone beyond that now,'' he said. ``It would be
inappropriate for me to be there.''
   Roger Libby, a former UMass sex education professor who tours
campuses lecturing on safe sex, said he would replace Maia as emcee.
   Jimmy Fund planning director Mark Cummings said the organization
approves only those activities that turn over entire proceeds to
the fund. He added, ``It is in bad form and bad taste to use the
Jimmy Fund with this contest.''

   Tim Weiner blushed happily and climbed on top of
a desk Thursday as his colleagues at The Philadelphia Inquirer
applauded after he captured the Pulitzer Prize for national
reporting.
   But Tom Shales of the Washington Post was in shock.
   ``I'm in a state of slack-jawed dumbfoundedness,'' said Shales,
the winner for criticism for his writing on television. ``I'm
shocked and delighted and very proud of the paper. It's an award
that really comes to the paper _ not to me; it's a nice feeling to
have brought it to the paper.''
   Reporters at the Inquirer, which claimed its 14th prize in 13
years, crowded around the newsroom and applauded when word of
Weiner's prize moved on The Associated Press wire.
   The recipient, who won for his series on a secret Pentagon
budget used to sponsor defense research and an arms buildup,
climbed onto a desk to say, ``I thank you very much.'' He then
puffed on a cigar.
   Weiner, 31, who came to the Inquirer in 1982 from the Kansas
City Times, said he feels like he just received a ``$10 million
check from Ed McMahon. I'm just a very happy guy and very lucky.''
   Toni Morrison, winner of the fiction award for ``Beloved,'' said
joy was uppermost in her feelings because ``I really was thinking
dark and difficult thoughts about what was available to this book
in terms of recognition.''
   The book became a center of controversy when it did not win two
other major literary prizes, and Morrison said she respected the
Pulitzer committee for ignoring ``outside matters of speculation
and gossip and some slander.''
   Knight-Ridder newspapers won six awards, including two each at
The Miami Herald and the Charlotte (N.C.) Observer and one each at
the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch and the Inquirer.
   Jim Batten, Knight-Ridder president, said the group has ``worked
hard over the years to attract some of the best people in the
American newspaper business and create a climate that encourages
people to do their best work.''
   Dave Barry, the 40-year-old Miami Herald humorist who won for
commentary, said he hopes winning the Pulitzer ``will make me
taller.''
   ``It's fun to win a Pulitzer; everybody should do it,'' Barry
said.
   His fellow Miami staff member, photographer Michel duCille,
garnered his second Pulitzer for photos of apartments inundated by
the drug crack.
   ``I don't want to lessen the Pulitzers, but I feel more proud
that the photos ... made changes in the community,'' duCille said.
   Cartoonist Doug Marlette, 37, who moved from The Charlotte
Observer to The Atlanta Constitution during the year, was honored
for work done at both papers.
   He said his biting approach can be traced in part to ``a
grandmother bayoneted by a guardsman during a mill strike in the
Carolinas. There are some rebellious genes floating around in me.''
   At the Alabama Journal in Montgomery, ``There was a lot of
dancing and yelling and singing when the announcement came over the
wire _ but that's not unusual for the Journal newsroom,'' quipped
Jim Tharpe, managing editor.
   The Journal and the Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune each won an
award for general news reporting; the Alabama paper's series dealt
with infant mortality.
   ``The Journal decided it was time to commit some resources to
the problem,'' said Bill Brown, executive editor of the Journal and
its sister daily, The Montgomery Advertiser.
   ``A Pulitzer Prize is nice,'' said Tharpe, ``but it's a plaque
on the wall. If we hope something will come of our work as
journalists, it's that the state will deal with the problem of
infant mortality.''
   At the Chicago Tribune, the winners were Dean Baquet, William
Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski for investigative reporting on ``on
the self-interest and waste that plague Chicago's City Council.''
   ``We're thrilled. It's been quite a few years since we've won
one here for local news coverage,'' said Ellen Soeteber, assistant
Tribune managing editor for metropolitan news.
   ``I think the team of reporters deserved this so much. ... It
was their idea, and they brought it off beautifully,'' she said.
``I'm so glad some of the leaders in our profession recognized it.''
   The Wall Street Journal captured two prizes: Walt Bogdanich for
specialized reporting and Daniel Hertzberg and James B. Stewart for
explanatory journalism.
   ``I know many great people who have only been recognized after
they died, but all else being equal, it's wonderful to get
recognition,'' said Stewart, 36.
   ``If I can win the Pulitzer Prize, the Cleveland Indians can win
the pennant this summer,'' said Bogdanich.
   Scott Shaw, a photographer for the Odessa (Texas) American, said
he had not been expecting to win the spot news award for his
coverage of the 58-hour operation that rescued little Jessica
McClure and fascinated a nation.
   ``I am pretty young. I am just pretty surprised,'' said Shaw,
24. ``Ever since I took the photo that night, the editors said I
was going to win. They were sure of it that night. And so it
happened.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government accused the United
States on Thursday of looking for a pretext to invade Panama, and
said it ordered its military not to harm Americans in the country.
   Government offices closed Thursday for a long Easter weekend
that looks bleak for 130,000 public employees, who were left
without paychecks for the second time this month.
   An eerie quiet gripped the streets of Panama City, which had
been filled in recent days with demonstrations against Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the Defense Forces commander who controls the
civilian government.
   Manuel Solis Palma, the president installed by Noriega, said in
a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that
U.S. armed forces in Panama and its waters constituted a threat to
the country.
   ``In spite of the situation created by the mobilization of U.S.
forces ... the Defense Forces of Panama have orders to refrain from
using lethal or destructive weapons at any time against the armed
forces of the United States or against U.S. civilians,'' said the
letter, released by the presidency.
   The ``mobilization'' of forces apparently referred to the
passage this week of the U.S. helicopter carrier Okinawa through
the Panama Canal, and U.S. military maneuvers in Panama that began
in early March.
   ``Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic
of Panama ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a
charge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching of
acts of war against Panama,'' the letter said.
   The Reagan administration has raised the possibility that the
U.S. military might be used to protect the estimated 50,000
American citizens in Panama against possible harrassment by that
country's security forces.
   It made the suggestion after Panamanian soldiers arrested and
beat several journalists, including American reporters, during a
raid Monday on a Panama City hotel.
   With most businesses and industries observing an 11-day-old
general strike against Noriega Thursday, the largest congregations
of people in Panama City were found in the food lines of welfare
agencies.
   Leaders of the National Civic Crusade were meeting to plan new
strategies in their frustrated effort to oust Noriega.
   ``We'll be talking over the weekend, discussing where we go from
here,'' said Roberto Aleman, a director of the Crusade, a coalition
of about 200 professional, business, labor, political and other
groups.
   In Caracas, former President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela
said he understood Noriega had promised to resign in May, the
unofficial start of a presidential campaign leading to elections in
May 1989. The general is under indictment in the United States on
drug trafficking charges.
   Major supermarkets and drug stores, and a few small shops, were
open Thursday in Panama City but most merchants observed the
strike. The groceries and pharmacies reopened Wednesday _ under
heavy government pressure, according to reports.
   The government closed its doors without meeting another $33
million payday for most ot its 130,000 employees despite the
collection this week of $19 million in quarterly tax revenues.
   About $5.5 million was said to be taxes and fees from U.S.
companies doing business in Panama, including Texaco, Eastern
Airlines and a banana-growing subsidiary of United Brands.
   In Washington, the White House announced tax incentives and
other measures Thursday to encourage American companies to withhold
payments from Panama. The Reagan administration said mandatory
action would be considered if the voluntary measures are not
sufficient.
   Most Panamanians were short of cash and food as a result of the
strike and the cash crisis, which was caused in part by a U.S.
freeze on Panamanian assets in American banks.
   The sanctions were imposed in February after Noriega supporters
in the National Assembly voted to oust Panama's civilian president,
Eric Arturo Delvalle, in retaliation for Delvalle's attempt to fire
Noriega.
   Banks have been closed since March 3.
   At a news conference in Caracas, Perez said Noriega had promised
Monsignor Marcos Antonio McGrath, the Catholic archbishop of
Panama, that he would step aside upon completion of his term of
service in May.
   But by law, military officers in Panama are supposed to resign
after 25 years of active service, and Noriega's official biography
shows that he entered the service in 1962, or 26 years ago.
   Perez and the leaders of Costa Rica and Spain asked McGrath to
serve as a mediator between Noriega and his opponents.

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Senate on Thursday appeared to
be just days away from the moment of truth in Gov. Evan Mecham's
impeachment trial after dismissing the third and most serious
charge against him.
   Senators declined to predict the outcome of next week's vote on
the two remaining charges. A two-thirds majority of the 30-member
Senate would be needed to remove the first-term Republican from
office.
   ``I'm prepared to vote,'' Republican Sen. Carol Macdonald said
one day after testimony was completed on the second impeachment
count. Like other senators, she declined to say what she had
decided.
   Many senators said they will wait until Monday's closing
arguments by prosecution and defense lawyers before deciding
whether to remove Mecham from office.
   The vote is likely to be taken Monday or Tuesday on impeachment
charges that Mecham tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged
death threat by a state official and that he misused $80,000 from
the governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   But before the vote could be taken, senators had to resolve a
last-minute political imbroglio Thursday over the dismissal of the
third charge, that Mecham concealed a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Wednesday's surprise vote to dismiss that article and vote on
the first two led to charges and counter-charges by Republicans and
Democrats that each side was playing politics.
   After a day of backroom negotiations Thursday, the Senate
decided against reinstating the third charge. Wednesday's action
was approved by all 11 Democrats but only five of the Senate's 19
Republicans.
   Attorneys had indicated Wednesday it would take at least five
weeks to present the case on the third charge.
   Republican Sen. Greg Lunn, who opposed throwing out the article,
said the dismissal was a ``serious error'' and added, ``Frankly,
I'm resentful, at this late stage in these proceedings, that we're
cutting deals as if this were an amendment to another piece of
legislation in order to get us out before adjournment.''
   Senate Republican Majority Leader Robert Usdane was more
philosophical, saying, ``It's a political trial. It's just a matter
of the way we work.''
   Mecham wanted the $350,000 loan count dismissed on grounds that
having it tried first in the Senate would taint his April 21
criminal trial on similar charges.
   The 16-12 vote to grant the governor's wish resulted from a
combination of Mecham's five staunchest GOP backers _ who want all
the charges dismissed _ and all 11 Democrats, who have been trying
for weeks to force the Senate to vote on each impeachment article
as evidence is completed.
   The Democrats contended their strategy was aimed at ensuring a
Senate vote on whether to remove Mecham from office well before he
is to face a May 17 recall election.
   Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat, said Republicans
possibly ``saw the potential for some to take advantage of this ...
and create a situation where they would never, never have to cast a
vote on this'' because Mecham could be removed from office by the
recall before the Senate got a chance to vote.
   Because the Senate can make its own rules, lawmakers will not
have to reach their conclusions ``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' as
in a criminal trial. Instead, they are to decide if there is
``clear and convincing evidence'' to convict Mecham, and it's up to
each of them to decide what that means.
   Also, GOP Sen. Bill DeLong noted, the governor does not have to
be guilty of a crime to be convicted in an impeachment trial;
Mecham can be removed for malfeasance in office.
   ``There's more than just the guilt or innocence on the
charges,'' DeLong said, adding that he expected senators to be told
by the presiding officer that they must ``take action which is in
the best interest of Arizona ... based on (Mecham's) ability to
continue in office.''

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Palestinian
rebellion called Thursday for riots during the visit of Secretary
of State George P. Shultz next week, and Israel's prime minister
vowed to crush the uprising.
   Soldiers shot one Palestinian dead, bringing the Arab death toll
to at least 124 since violence began Dec. 8 in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, where 1.5 million Palestinians live. An
Israeli soldier also has been killed.
   Israeli officials lifted a three-day closure of the West Bank as
scheduled at 3 a.m. Friday (8 p.m. EST Thursday), allowing
residents to travel out of their towns and villages. A curfew that
confined people in the Gaza Strip to their homes was also ended at
that time.
   Five-hour nightly curfews imposed before the shutdown were
scheduled to continue in Gaza. The end of the three-day confinement
meant that journalists could travel freely in the territories.
   Issuance of Leaflet No. 12 from leaders of the rebellion
indicated Israel had not removed its leadership despite mass
arrests last week of more than 1,000 people, including those Israel
said were responsible for publishing the leaflets.
   Arabs known to be involved have said that, if the Israelis
caught some of them, other people would be ready to take their
places.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told hundreds of cheering Jewish
settlers Israel would crush the rebellion in the lands it has
controlled since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   ``Some Arabs are going crazy down there. They are trying to harm
what we have built,'' Shamir said at Herodion, site of the biblical
King Herod's palace.
   ``They say ... this land belongs to the rioters, the killers,
the terrorists. But if somebody tries to harm this ... we will
break his hand on these rocks.''
   Authorities put new restrictions on the 130,000 Arabs of east
Jerusalem but Greek Orthodox Christians, fearing for their safety,
decided nonetheless to cancel pre-Easter processions.
   Soldiers allowed the 650,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to
leave their homes for the first time in three days when the army
lifted a curfew for five hours.
   Street clashes between young Arabs and soldiers soon began in
Khan Yunis, Rafah and the Jabaliya refugee camp, and the army
restored the curfew at Jabaliya, Israel radio said.
   One Palestinian was wounded in Rafah, the radio said. Shifa
Hospital officials said another Arab from Khan Yunis was shot in
the neck and Israel television said a Palestinian was wounded in
the West Bank city of Tulkarm.
   In the West Bank city of Yatta, soldiers shot an 18-year-old
Palestinian dead during several hours of clashes with protesters
hurling rocks and bottles, the army said.
   Mayor Ismael Abu Hemaid said Suleiman Ahmed al Jundi died of a
stomach wound.
   The latest leaflet, signed by the Palestine Liberation
Organization, urged ``all the Arab world to block Shultz' plan and
to stop him from killing the uprising.''
   It ordered riots Monday through Wednesday of next week to
protest the Shultz visit and a proposed U.S. peace plan. The
secretary of state is to begin a shuttle through the region Sunday.
   ``We are telling the Arab world, we don't need money. We are
ready to starve. We will never kneel. We are going to die as
martyrs,'' the leaflet said.
   Shamir's equally tough declaration at Herodion: ``We will
continue to act against the violence until we stamp it out.''
   Military jeeps escorted Shamir's car and a busload of
journalists through an army roadblock sealing off the West Bank.
Reporters saw six Palestinian flags, which are outlawed, hanging
from power lines.
   Patriarch Diodorus of Jerusalem canceled three pre-Easter
processions of the Greek Orthodox church because of the violence,
said the Rev. Thimoteus Margaritis, church spokesman.
   He said it was the first cancellation since the 1967 war.
Margaritis said only 1,500 pilgrims were expected for the Orthodox
Easter on April 10, compared with 10,000 last year.
   Tourism to Israel declined 13 percent in the first week of March
compared with the same period of 1987, a Tourism Ministry
spokeswoman said.
   Benjamin Netanyahu announced his resignation as Israel's U.N.
ambassador to protest a meeting between Shultz and two
Arab-Americans linked to the PLO.
   It was the strongest indication yet of Israeli displeasure over
the meeting last Saturday with the members of the Palestine
National Council, which acts as the PLO legislature.
   In remarks broadcast on Israel radio, Shultz said it was
``beyond the pale'' to suggest he could not meet with American
citizens.
   The Interior Ministry imposed new travel restrictions on Arabs
in east Jerusalem, requiring Palestinians aged 16-35 to have
special permits for trips to Jordan, ministry spokeswoman Tova
Elinson said. She said permits would be issued only for stays of
nine months or longer.
   Israel radio said the limitations were designed to stop the PLO
from sending couriers into the occupied territories.

   Despite an uncertain outlook, Secretary
of State George P. Shultz was set Thursday to try again to persuade
Arabs and Israelis to open negotiations May 1.
   Shultz made no prediction on how much progress the U.S. peace
plan would make in the Middle East during his shuttle diplomacy
there next week, but he was cautiously upbeat, particularly about
King Hussein of Jordan.
   ``The Jordanians are quite intrigued with this,'' Shultz said,
``and I look forward to intensive discussions with the king.''
   He described the Israelis, meanwhile, as having ``varying
views.'' Clearly referring to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Shultz
said he would point out that the peace conference he is proposing
is not the active authority that is causing objections in Jerusalem.
   It simply would set up direct negotiations between the Arabs and
Israelis, Shultz said.
   Israel, Jordan and Syria all have neither accepted nor rejected
Shultz's proposal.
   ``When they are reluctant to say no, it means everybody
understands the importance of trying to find a way to peace and
security,'' he told reporters aboard his U.S. Air Force jet.
   After refueling here, Shultz headed for Rome for Easter
observances and meetings with Italian officials. He is shopping for
a new home for 72 U.S. F-16 jet fighters that Spain will expel from
the Torrejon air base near Madrid in 1991.
   Italy is a prime candidate, along with Portugal and Turkey.
   Then Shultz flies to Israel on Sunday to begin a five-day
Mideast venture that also will take him to Jordan, Syria, Egypt and
Saudi Arabia. It will be Shultz's second intensive tour of the
Middle East in a month.
   During his trip, Shultz also hoped to make headway on Lebanon in
discussions with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   The State Department's director of Lebanon, Jordan and Syrian
affairs, April Glaspie, already is in Damascus where Shultz will
see Assad next week.
   U.S. and diplomatic sources said the Syrian leader may be
interested in arrangements for a new distribution of power among
vying sects in Lebanon's 12-year-old civil war.
   Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of 21 senators urged Shultz to
refrain from meeting with members of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, saying his meeting last week with two Palestinian
Americans ``sets a dangerous precedent.''
   Shultz met last Saturday in Washington with two university
professors who are members of the Palestine National Council, the
PLO's parliamentary arm. He denied that his meeting violated U.S.
law which forbids negotiating with the PLO, saying that not all PNC
members are also members in the PLO.
   But the senators said they see ``no distinction between the PLO
and the PNC.''
   The senators said they wished Shultz success on his mission and
hoped he would be able to meet with Palestinians who are not PLO
members. An attempt by Shultz to meet with 15 Palestinians from the
Israeli-occupied territories during his last trip to the region
several weeks ago failed when the PLO refused to endorse the
meeting and the Palestinians did not show up.
   The mid-March deadline he set for a reply to his plan for
negotiations has passed. But impelled by violence on the
Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza _ 123 Palestinian Arabs and an
Israeli soldier have been killed in less than three months _ Shultz
is determined to keep trying.
   U.S. officials find some hope in the fact that while Israel,
Jordan and Syria have not accepted the plan they also have not
rejected it. Only Egypt has given its endorsement.
   The plan calls for a Mideast conference in April to launch the
negotiations. They would open on May 1 and deal with providing some
form of self-rule to Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Israel would deal with a joint delegation of Jordanians and
Palestinian Arabs to work an interim arrangement to last three
years.
   Meanwhile, negotiations on an overall settlement of the
Arab-Israeli dispute that also would involve Syria would begin in
December.
   Primarily because of Syria's key role in the Middle East, Shultz
had drawn Assad into the discussions after several years of icy
relations, U.S. officials said.
   But they said Shultz also was taking up with Assad the
possibility of new arrangements in Lebanon, where the Syrians have
dominated politics. Assad, meanwhile, may be interested in reducing
Syria's involvement in the country, said the officials, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>US Seeking Agreement From Soviets on Continued Aid to Combatants</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: New thruout with Shultz saying Soviets could keep arming

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Thursday the Soviet Union could keep arming Marxist forces in
Afghanistan as part of a peace agreement, provided the United
States could maintain supplies to the rebels.
   ``It would be better to have a moratorium,'' Shultz said as he
launched another overseas trip to pursue peace in the Middle East.
   But, he told reporters aboard a U.S. Air Force jet en route to
Rome, ``To date, the Soviets have not wanted to do that.''
   The issue of U.S. and Soviet military aid to rival forces is the
main roadblock to an agreement to end the war in Afghanistan after
more than eight years.
   Shultz proposed in March to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze that both sides declare a moratorium. It would be in
effect while the Soviets withdrew their estimated 120,000 trroops
and for three months afterward.
   The Soviets accused the United States of posing a last-minute
obstacle to an agreement. Negotiations between Afghanistan and
Pakistan, which were held under U.N. auspices, stalled.
   Shultz, who will go on to Jerusalem on Sunday to begin a
five-day Mideast shuttle, made it clear he preferred a suspension
of Soviet aid to the Marxists and U.S. support for the resistance
group. U.S. aid has included Stinger missiles that were effective
against Soviet aircraft and helicopters.
   But Shultz said the overall goal was ``a balanced outcome.'' He
said there was nothing in the Geneva accords on Afghanistan ``that
tells us we cannot support our friends.''
   He said, ``If the Soviets exercise restraint, we are prepared to
exercise restraint.''
   Shultz said he did not know whether the Soviets would go along
with providing equal levels of aid to the two sides.
   But he stressed the United States was prepared to guarantee a
settlement even while aid kept flowing to the combatants.
   ``If we have signed the accords and see a need to support our
friends, we will be able to do it,'' he said.
   Shultz said he discussed the idea on the telephone Wednesday
with Pakistani Prime Minister Mohammad Kahn Junejo and that
President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq then called President Reagan.
   ``So these things are in place,'' Shnultz said. ``Where we will
all come out remains to be seen.''
   U.S. officials in Washington said earlier that the Reagan
administration was seeking Moscow's approval for continued outside
aid to the Afghan combatants after Soviet troops are withdrawn.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there has been no
indication of approval from the Soviets. Other officials sought to
dispel the notion that the Soviets had even indicated a willingness
to consider the proposal.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, their clients in
Afghanistan and the government of neighboring Pakistan, have been
involved for months in U.N.-sponsored efforts to bring about a
withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops fighting in
Afghanistan.
   The Soviets have agreed in principle to begin the troop
withdrawal two months after a settlement is reached and Pakistan is
eager for such a deal so that millions of Afghan refugees on
Pakistani territory can go home.
   Preventing a final agreement, however, has been a U.S. demand
that the Kremlin stop aiding the Afghan government after Soviet
troops depart. Until such aid ceases, the United States will
continue backing the Afghan rebels, Reagan has said.
   During talks with Shevardnadze in Washington last month, Shultz
renewed a plea for what the United States has been calling a
``symmetrical cessation'' of superpower aid to the Afghan
combatants.
   The new proposal, rather than calling for symmetrical cessation
of aid, envisions parallel continuation of assistance.
   ``We now express the policy in terms of `we will continue aid to
the Mujahadeen as long as the Soviet Union continues aid to the
Kabul government,''' Fitzwater said.
   ``The basic point to make is that our policy has not changed in
the sense that we will not desert the Afghan rebels,'' the
spokesman said. ``We will not cut off money to them as long as the
Soviets are providing aid.''
   Fitzwater did not explain how the new U.S. language might be
more palatable to the Soviets except to say ``there are some
negotiating reasons why it could hopefully allow the agreement to
be signed in Geneva and clear the way for a pullout.''
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said ``it would go too far,'' to say Shevardnadze signaled an
interest in the proposal last week, although he did not
specifically reject the idea.
   The source said that before the U.S. proposal was devised, some
administration officials warned against making an agreement to
continue aid to the Afghan combatants part of a secret
understanding with the Soviets.
   It would be against U.S. law to sign an Afghan peace accord that
required a cutoff of aid to the resistance forces while agreeing
privately with the Soviets to continue such assistance, the
official said.
   Asked on Thursday if a decision to continue aid would be part of
an open agreement, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman
said ``that's always been our stance.''

<HEAD>President Says Troops Fighting ``Grim Battles'' With Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam, in
a rare mention of northern Ethopian insurgents, said Thursday his
troops are fighting ``grim battles'' against secessionist rebels,
Radio Ethiopia reported.
   It was the first government comment on reports of a new rebel
offensive, which resulted in the capture last week of a strategic
town and three Soviet officers advising the Ethiopian army.
   The rebel Tigray People's Liberation Front claimed Thursday it
had also captured Axum and Adowa, two historic towns in northern
Ethiopia.
   Assesa Mamo, North American representative of the Tigray
People's Liberation Front, said rebels took the towns Thursday
after a three-day battle.
   Mamo spoke from Washington in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press bureau in Nairobi, Kenya.
   State-owned Radio Ethiopia quoted Mengistu as saying rebels in
Tigray and neighboring Eritrea had launched a ``systematic and
highly destructive campaign,'' disrupting transport and
communications networks in their regions.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Mengistu's statement indicated the fighting must be serious. They
said there were reports the Ethiopian leader is preparing a huge
counteroffensive against rebels of the Eritrea People's Liberation
Front and the Tigray rebel group.
   It is believed to be the first time Mengistu has conceded
publicly that the rebels, whom the government normally calls
``bandits,'' are in any way effective.
   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies 13 years ago when, with a
group of army officers, he dethroned Emperor Haile Selassie and
helped set up a Marxist government.
   Mengistu made the comments about the rebels in a report to the
eighth regular meeting of the Central Committee of his Marxist
Workers' Party of Ethiopia.
   He appealed to Ethiopians to ``rise in unity in the face of this
new challenge,'' according to Radio Ethiopia.
   The radio gave no further details of Mengistu's speech and it
was not clear whether his comments concerned the rebels' claims on
Axum and Adowa.
   Axum is 110 miles south of Asmara, Eritrea's provincial capital,
and Adowa is 30 miles from Axum.
   Eritrean rebels said Sunday they captured the town of Afabet,
killing or capturing 18,000 Ethiopian troops. The rebels said one
Soviet officer was killed and three taken prisoner. Afabet is 100
miles north of Asmara.
   The rebels claimed to have wiped out three government divisions
and captured tanks, weapons and other military equipment worth
millions of dollars.
   There was no way to verify the rebels' claims. But Western
diplomats in Addis Ababa said the figure of 18,000 troops, a third
of troops stationed in the north, sounded preposterous.
   The Soviet Union confirmed three of its advisers were captured,
but said nothing of a fourth officer being killed.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in Africa's
oldest civil war.
   Rebels in Tigray claimed they captured three towns and more than
3,500 government soldiers in March. There is no way to confirm
independently such rebel reports, on which the government refuses
to comment.
   The fighting has aggravated relief efforts in the north, the
worst-hit drought region of Ethiopia. Most of the 6 to 7 million
Ethiopians threatened with starvation this year live in the north.
   Because of rebel activities, the government often closes roads
in the region, cutting off truck convoys.
   The U.N. World Food Program reported Thursday that a relief
convoy reached the town of Wukro in Tigray province, bringing the
first major food delivery to the drought-stricken area since
January.
   The emergency shipment of 1,500 metric tons, enough to feed
100,000 people for a month, arrived Sunday, said David Morton, the
U.N. representative in Ethiopia.

   House approval of $48 million in humanitarian
aid for the Contra rebels and for children injured in Nicaragua's
civil war marks the first time in more than five years that
lawmakers have been able to set aside partisan divisions on the
issue.
   The House voted 345 to 70 late Wednesday to approve the aid
package and send what the chamber's leaders said was a strong
signal of support to the rebels and the leftist Sandinista
government, which are trying to forge a long-term cease-fire.
   The winning margin came from 179 Democratic votes and 166 GOP
votes. The largest group of dissenters seemed to be liberal
Democrats, many of whom oppose any form of Contra aid on principle.

temporary truce that is to be expanded into a 60-day cease-fire on
Friday.
   But the rebels' chief field commander said on Wednesday he
supports the peace accord with the leftist Sandinista government
that brought the truce.
   The two sides have not yet agreed on logistics of the
cease-fire, during which the roughly 10,000 Contra fighters are to
move into five zones while a lasting peace agreement is negotiated.
Talks resume Tuesday.

   The FBI and Italian authorities on Thursday
arrested more than 130 people and cracked a major Sicilian Mafia
drug ring that used cocaine from the United States to buy heroin in
Italy for return to U.S. markets, officials said.
   The FBI said that 69 people had been arrested in the United
States and 68 in Italy by midday. Authorities said 96 others were
being sought by Italian authorities.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III called it ``the largest
international drug case ever developed by the Department of
Justice.'' He said it would have a ``significant impact on heroin
imports into this country from Italy,'' but he said he could not
say what volume of drugs has been affected.

   The virus that causes AIDS actually changes

progresses, according to studies at the University of California in

   In a report to be published Friday, Dr. Jay A. Levy, professor
of medicine at UCSF, said he and a group of researchers discovered
the changing virus by studying blood samples taken over a four-year
period from four men who were infected by the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   The scientists found that as the AIDS patients became sicker,
the virus seemed to evolve and strengthen.

<HEAD>Comedy Makes a Rare Appearance Among Best Actor Nominees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedy makes a rare appearance in this year's
Academy Awards, with stand-up comic Robin Williams vying with four
dramatic performers for the prize as best actor.
   Some critics of Oscar's seriousness argue that Steve Martin
should have been nominated for best actor because of his modern-day
Cyrano in ``Roxanne.'' But in a year that saw a number of
impressive performances by comedians, only Williams drew the nod
for his manic disc jockey in ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''
   Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, the real-life announcer who
regaled American troops with jokes and rock 'n' roll over the army
radio service. The funny side of the role was a breeze for
Williams, and director Barry Levinson allowed him free rein.
   ``Obviously, the radio part offered me a chance to do some
open-field running,'' Williams says. ``Barry had been a comic
himself, and he would spark to some of my suggestions and let me go
with them. Many of the things in the movie, like the James Brown
impression and playing records at different speeds, happened
spontaneously.''
   Williams' depth of feeling in the later, dramatic scenes of
``Good Morning, Vietnam'' surprised some reviewers. Williams
studied drama under John Houseman at the famed Juilliard School in
New York, but even then his comedic side was emerging. One of his
teachers chided him: ``You're mimicking people. Where is YOUR
voice?'' He soon found it. After a broken romance, Williams dropped
out of Juilliard and began playing West Coast comedy clubs.
   The comic's contenders in the best actor race are thought of as
being more dramatic thespians.
   Michael Douglas was considered for two powerful roles: as the
venomous inside trader of ``Wall Street'' and the erring husband of
``Fatal Attraction.'' The actors branch of the Academy decided to
nominate him for ``Wall Street.''
   ``It was a marvelous role that Oliver Stone wrote,'' Douglas
says. ``I don't know why he chose me for the part, but he must have
seen something in me that even I didn't even know about.
   ``Playing a heavy is just fantastic; it's so much more fun than
being the good guy. I can understand the attraction that (villains)
have for actors.
   ``All of us try to be civilized human beings, but deep down
inside we have this feeling to tell everything like it is. The part
of Gordon Gecco was a wonderful opportunity for this release. After
playing moral redeeeming characters and goodie guys, it was a
ball.''
   Can an actor win an Oscar for a performance in a foreign
language? Sophia Loren did it in 1961 with ``Two Women.'' Now
Marcello Mastroianni stands a chance for his role as the vain
Italian aristocrat who pursues a new love to Russia in ``Dark
Eyes.''
   Mastroianni has acted in 116 films, and he still averages three
a year. Why does he work so hard at 64?
   ``Basically, I am an empty person,'' he said. ``When I act I
feel complete because I use the personalities of these characters
to fill this emptiness. I am also a childish person, and what
better way to live life than by traveling to all these countries
and getting paid to have fun and act like a fool, no?''
   What William Hurt feels about acting is not publicly known,
since he is one of the least interviewed of film stars. Obviously,
he is doing something right, since he has been nominated three
times in seven films and won the Oscar for ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman'' two years ago.
   His latest nomination came for his portrayal of Tom Grunick, the
handsome but not-too-bright network anchor man in ``Broadcast
News.'' Hurt's few interviews have produced somewhat turgid quotes.
As he himself explains: ``I have, fortunately or unforunately,
skill at going down paths of endless non sequiturs.
   In a recent Premiere magazine interview, Hurt expounded on what
he considered the major question of ``Broadcast News.''
   ``What is the nature, to put it simply, of romance in our time?
What are our motives in wanting to be together? How do we pair up?
Who do we mate with, and why do we do it? A lot of us don't know
the answer, a lot of us feel in flux,'' he said.
   Jack Nicholson has also been recently scarce in the media,
apparently content to do his work without theorizing about it in
public. In 1987, he shone in three roles: as the devil in ``The
Witches of Eastwick''; as the Depression bum in ``Ironweed''; as
star network anchor in ``Broadcast News.'' He won his ninth
nomination for his role as the former big-league ballplayer in
``Ironweed.''
   Despite the cynical roles he has played, Nicholson has
maintained that he remains an optimist. In a 1986 interview he
remarked:
   ``I don't want to do what I accuse other people of doing: not
taking the time to smell the roses. Something very wonderful has
happened to me. I don't want the fact that I see this endless din
and gloom in the world to make me incapable of expressing something
that's quite frankly wonderful. I'm a very fortunate person to be
where I am and do what I do.''

   Anne Ramsey found out that she had been
nominated for an Academy Award as supporting actress when a friend
called her at 5 a.m.
   ``Within 15 minutes a television crew was at the house,'' she
said. ``I had time to wash my face, and that was about all. I was
absolutely flabbergasted.''
   The nomination of Ramsey, Danny DeVito's horrendous mother in
``Throw Momma From the Train,'' provided one of the highlights of a
race that includes a 60-year veteran of films, the cousin of a
presidential candidate, a classic Argentine actress and a young
actress who stood her own against a galvanizing performance by
Glenn Close.
   Here is a look at the nominees:
   Norma Aleandro played the Mexican Indian who devoted her life to
be the constant companion of a severely handicapped girl in
``Gaby.'' A distinguished theater actress in Buenos Aires, she was
forced into exile by the military government of Argentina. After
the junta was overthrown, she returned home to star in the
Oscar-winning ``The Official Story,'' which dealt with the
atrocities of the regime.
   ``Gaby'' was Miss Aleandro's first film in English. She regrets
that the movie has found a limited audience, apparently because
people were scared away by its theme.
   ``It's not a sad movie,'' she says. ``We are not speaking about
sadness. We are speaking about people, about seeking freedom.
Sometimes people forget that freedom is in the mind.''
   Anne Archer was nominated for the part of Michael Douglas' wife
in ``Fatal Attraction.'' Considering the galvanic role afforded
Glenn Close as the vengeful other woman, you might think that
Archer would have had reservations about her role.
   ``Not at all,'' she says. ``I always thought that (the wife) was
a strong and interesting character, and she got to go through an
interesting change. That is something you always look for: It's
important that a character be different at the end of a script than
in the beginning.
   ``She was sexy and vulnerable and strong. An interesting lady. I
never felt even remotely that she would be overshadowed.''
   Ann Sothern made her first movie in 1929, according to the
record books. After a long and diverse career in films and
television, mostly in comedy, she won her first Academy recognition
for a serious role in ``The Whales of August.''
   Along with co-stars Bette Davis, Lillian Gish and Vincent Price,
Sothern filmed ``The Whales of August'' on a remote Maine island.
   ``There was no hotel, only a tiny store,'' she recalls. ``We all
stayed in private homes; mine was a lobster fisherman's. The
weather was murder: beautiful and sunny in the morning, and stormy
in the afternoon.
   ``There was absolutely nothing to do at night. Fortunately, I
brought my cook and my poker chips.''
   Olympia Dukakis has long been a working actress in theater,
films and television, but she didn't impress a national audience
until ``Moonstruck.'' Her success came at the same time her first
cousin, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, sought the Democratic
nomination for president.
   She grew up in a Greek family in which everybody argued
politics. After graduating from Boston University, she worked as a
physical therapist to earn enough money to return and study theater
arts.
   Despite her newfound fame, she intends to remain in the theater;
she is the artistic director of the Whole Theater in Montclair, N.J.
   ``I'm not convinced this being a celebrity is going to be
long-lived,'' she says cautiously.
   Fame was also a long time coming for Ramsey: ``Thirty-nine years
later, after everything I've tried to do and everything I've
wanted, this has happened. What a curious moment. Thank God, thank
Danny (DeVito, who directed `Momma'), thank everybody.''
   Ramsey has more to be thankful for than an Academy nomination. A
year and a half ago, she underwent surgery for cancer of the
tongue. She apparently has recovered, but reconstruction of her
tongue gave her slurred speech. Happily, it fit perfectly into the
character of the fierce Momma.
   The actress admits that she dreamed of an Oscar as a child
growing up in suburban New York.
   ``I have a diary in which I wrote about it,'' she said. ``I was
a real movie buff when I was a little girl. I read all the fan
magazines, and I wrote for autographs and pictures from the stars.
I wanted to be an actress from the time my father took me to see
`The Petrified Forest' at the age of 4.
   ``I fell in love with actors, especially in the romantic films _
Tyrone Power, Errol Flynn, Greer Garson, Walter Pidgeon. I just
loved movies. And now this (nomination) has happened. It's
unbelievable.''

<HEAD>Book Revives Mystery of Nazi Massacre in France</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ORADOUR-SUR-GLANE, France (AP) _ Just after lunch on the warm
afternoon of June 10, 1944, the Nazi SS began rounding up people in
this prosperous country town and dividing them into groups. Then
they tortured, shot and burned them.
   Historians have long pondered the reasons for the slaughter of
642 children, women and men and the destruction of
Oradour-sur-Glane, carried out four days after the Allied invasion
of Normandy in a village with no history of ties to the French
Resistance.
   A new book by a British businessman, Robin Mackness, claims to
solve the mystery, suggesting that the massacre was a desperate
attempt by the Nazis to find a lost fortune in gold.
   Survivors of the massacre and the families of those who died
have vowed to stop publication in France of ``Oradour, Massacre and
Aftermath,'' already No. 5 on the British bestseller list and
scheduled for publication by Random House in the United States this
fall. They claim the book warps history and insults the memory of
Oradour's ``martyrs.''
   Robert Hebras, 62, who says he hid under the bodies of his
neighbors to escape Nazi bullets, put it more bluntly.
   ``Everyone makes money from the name of Oradour-sur-Glane. This
must cease.''
   Oradour has been preserved _ in ruins _ exactly as it was the
day the Germans marched off after the slaughter. In 1945 the French
government declared the centuries-old village near Limoges a
national historic site and it has been visited by more than 500,000
people each year.
   Plaques mark the sheds, cellars and barns where men were shot in
the knees, interrogated, then machine gunned and their bodies
burned.
   A cross stands outside the church where women and children
huddled in terror for hours listening to gunfire kill their menfolk
before the SS came to gun them down and set the sanctuary ablaze.
   A piece of twisted metal in the corner of the altar was once a
baby carriage. A car on the village green rusts where it was parked
by the mayor's son.
   Only 13 people survived.
   ``My wife lost all her family, her mother, sister, uncle,
aunt,'' said Rene Montaigne, a spokesman for the survivors'
association. ``She still goes to the ruins because she feels at
home there. She sees them all, even though they are dead.''
   The new Oradour-sur-Glane, built adjacent to the ruins, has
taken decades to recover.
   ``No one got married here for 20 years and it was only a couple
of years ago that we had a wedding in June,'' said Dr. Robert
Lapuelle, mayor of the town since 1959. ``It was 1963 before we had
enough youngsters to make a soccer team.
   ``No wonder people here are upset about this book.''
   Mackness' story is full of intrigue and personal adventure
involving smuggled gold ingots and a shadowy figure named Raoul.
   Mackness writes that Raoul told him that the ingots were a part
of more than half a ton of gold that he and a few French Resistance
companions seized during a midnight ambush of an SS convoy.
   According to the book, the only survivors of the ambush were
Raoul, who buried the treasure by the side of the road, and a
German soldier who reported the event.
   The gold apparently was a sort of floating pension fund for some
officers of the 2nd SS Panzer Division, planning to stash it in
Swiss banks for after the war, Mackness writes.
   It goes on to say that following the ambush, SS Maj. Otto
Dickmann rushed to the scene and, finding nothing and panicking,
dashed to Oradour, the nearest village.
   About 10 books have offered different explanations for the
slaughter. But all have left questions dangling.
   Mackness claims to answer many of these, but he seems to be
having trouble getting anyone to accept his story because his
sources are concealed.
   Dickmann and Raoul are dead. Mackness refuses to divulge the
names of his living sources, many of whom, he says, fear
prosecution for the massacre.
   For many historians, Mackness' word isn't enough.
   ``No historic fact allows me to give this business the least
credibility,'' Jacques Delarue, a French historian, was quoted by
the French newspaper Le Figaro as saying.
   But Mackness stands by his story.
   ``It fits the known historical facts,'' he said in a telephone
interview from London.
   ``The people in France who object to my book haven't read it
because it hasn't been, and may not be, published there.''
   In Oradour, Mackness is accused of dancing on the graves of the
dead.
   ``Mr. Mackness' ambush never happened, at least not near
Oradour,'' said Mayor Lapuelle, who added that the villagers want
to preserve the simple, brutal truth of the event, so ``this will
never happen again.''

   ``I had a brother at Khe Sahn,
   ``Fightin' off them Viet Cong.
   ``They're still there.
   ``He's all gone.''
   _ Bruce Springsteen.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bruce Springsteen has turned down untold amounts
of money for commercial use of his song, ``Born in the U.S.A.'' He
gave it to the makers of HBO's ``Dear America: Letters Home from
Vietnam'' for free.
   Filmmaker Bill Couturie edited thousands of feet of archival
footage into a backdrop for the letters in this devastating
90-minute documentary, premiering Sunday on HBO.
   Besides Springsteen, the soundtrack includes vintage '60s rock
from such artists as the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and Marvin Gaye.
The letters are read off-camera by a star-studded cast of voices,
including Robert De Niro, Kathleen Turner, Robin Williams and
Michael J. Fox, who all donated their time.
   At a recent screening in New York, some members of the audience
were so moved by the film they were unable to get out of their
seats when it was over.
   The documentary is based on the book of the same name and plays
on HBO throughout April.
   ``Dear America'' is different from other Vietnam movies in that
it is told in the words of the vets themselves in the often
strikingly eloquent letters they wrote to loved ones back home:
   _ A lieutenant who had just seen a soldier lose his leg writes
to his brother, ``I've never seen such bravery and guts before and
I'm stunned by it. You shoulda seen my men fight. They were going
after wounded men no one else would go after. You shoulda seen my
brave men.''
   _ Writes Army nurse Lynda Van Devanter, ``I'm sick of facing,
every day, a new bunch of children ripped to pieces. They're just
kids _ eighteen, nineteen years old! It stinks! Whole lives ahead
of them _ cut off. I'm sick to death of it. I've got to get out of
here ...''
   Almost all the footage came from the heretofore untapped NBC
News archives. ABC's Vietnam footage had already been used in
several movies, and CBS does not allow outside producers to use its
archives. NBC's library had been closed to filmmakers until General
Electric bought the network and changed the policy.
   ``I happened to be at the right place at the right time,'' said
Couturie.
   HBO said that because Couturie shot none of the film, the
Academy Awards committee turned down the documentary for Oscar
consideration, but HBO plans to put it up for an Emmy.
   Couturie said his interviews with vets from an earlier project
convinced him of the importance of the letters, virtually the only
link between those in Vietnam and ``the world.'' The other link was
rock 'n' roll.
   The soundtrack is an '60s treasury. But Springsteen's ``Born in
the U.S.A.'' became the anthem of Vietnam veterans' disillusionment
and courage in the '80s.
   Springsteen had allowed the song to be used once before, in the
Vietnam play ``Tracers,'' produced by Tom Bird, co-producer of the
HBO film. Couturie just had to have the song for the ending of
``Dear America.''
   ``We went to Springsteen and asked him if we could use it, and
he immediately said yes. It didn't take one second for him to say
yes. In fact, his comment was, `It's the vets' song. Of course, you
can use it,''' Couturie said.
   Springsteen donated the song on the condition that all the music
be donated, giving the producers leverage to obtain the other music
without cost.
   The film is structured chronologically and punctuated by stark
graphics describing the escalation of the conflict. The combination
of music and pictures evokes the era, not just the war.
   But above it all are the words.
   Couturie knew what he wanted in the reading of the letters _ a
delicate balance of emotion that didn't go over the edge into
melodrama. He found himself giving direction to the biggest names
in acting _ De Niro, Williams, Turner, Fox, Martin Sheen, Sean
Penn, Willem Dafoe, Brian Dennehy, John Heard, Harvey Keitel, Randy
Quaid, Howard Rollins Jr. and John Savage, among others.
   Ellen Burstyn reads the last, most devastating letter, from a
mother to a son who died in the conflict 15 years earlier.
   When Burstyn arrived at the studio, Couturie said, she brushed
him off, insisting brusquely that they just get on with it.
   ``My heart was sinking,'' he said. ``I was going, oh, God, this
woman has a lunch date or something and wants to get out of here,
and this is the most crucial letter in the film, and I really blew
it, I've picked the wrong person.'' She was not the wrong person.
She had been rehearsing the letter on her own and couldn't discuss
it, she had to just do it.
   ``That's the only letter that was done in one take,'' Couturie
said. ``She went in and just nailed it. It was an awesome
performance.''

   Try as they might, Lutherans in this proud
mill town can't seem to forgive or forget the controversy that
shook their church when a mild-mannered pastor added protest to
prayer.
   Sunday after Sunday four years ago, D. Douglas Roth preached
against ``corporate evil'' and the moral imperative of helping
workers in this economically strapped area.
   Often the sermons were delivered after he and others burst into
services attended by steel industry executives. The protesters put
dead fish in safe deposit boxes, and sprayed skunk oil at banks.
   The protests climaxed in January 1985 when seven of Roth's
supporters, including his wife, barricaded themselves inside
Trinity Lutheran Church in defiance of a court order, only to be
routed by sheriff's deputies.
   Now, many of the faithful are back in their pews, worshipping
with a new minister. Roth, now defrocked, conducts Lutheran-style
services every Sunday for a smaller flock at a Pentecostal
sanctuary across town.
   The protest group, Denominational Ministry Strategy, has changed
its name to DMX to mimic its main target, USX Corp., which used to
be United States Steel Corp.
   And the controversy surrounding DMX's tactics rumbles on.
   ``This group can't back off and say, `Well, maybe we were wrong.
We've caused a lot of heartache and we're sorry,'' said Mary
Gahagen, 70, a lay official at the newly organized Lutheran Church
of the Holy Spirit in what used to be Trinity Lutheran.
   ``For the ones living here, they'll never get over it,'' said
the Rev. Walter Koehler, 61, the church's new pastor. ``It's not
hatred, but it borders on that.''
   Roth and other DMX supporters take it all in stride.
   ``They think we're crazy,'' said Roth, 36, wearing, as always,
his clerical collar. ``They know we'll do whatever it takes.''
   Roth's latest brush with the law came March 4 during Prince
Charles' visit to a Pittsburgh area jobs center for the unemployed.
Roth and another DMX supporter were arrested while protesting
outside, but were cleared of disorderly conduct charges.
   ``We're upsetting and making all sorts of impact without even
having to lift a finger,'' boasted Daniel Solberg, 37, another
defrocked Lutheran minister and a DMX leader. His brother, actor
David Soul, periodically has lent his support.
   Gone are all but a half dozen of the Lutheran pastors who helped
organize the church-sponsored ministry in the early 1980s. The
group soon charged Pittsburgh-area corporate giants like USX and
Mellon Bank with abandoning once-prosperous steel towns along the
Monongahela and Ohio rivers.
   ``This is a small but vocal minority. I think people understand
that,'' said the Rev. Edward Kappeler, 56, an official of the
Southwestern Pennsylvania Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America. ``The broad consensus of the Lutheran church is that
the church is doing what it can in the areas the DMX has always
professed to be concerned about.''
   Gone, too, are the unionists who backed the rebel clergymen's
cause. ``It became a church battle, that's what happened,''
explained Ron Weisen, 51, a former United Steelworkers local
president.
   As for Roth, he says his defrocking and going on welfare have
helped him empathize more with the problems he was protesting and
made him more credible among the unemployed.
   ``There are prices to be paid, particularly in the family,''
said Roth, a father of four. ``But family is exactly why you do
this. How can you look your children in the eyes and say, `Well, we
have to take care of ourselves'? It's very bad theology.''
   The unorthodox crusade began in earnest on Easter 1984 when DMX
supporters stormed into an affluent Pittsburgh church and railed
against ``corporate evil.'' They declared that overseas investments
by steelmakers and other businesses were contributing to the area's
high jobless rate.
   The next Sunday, and the next and the next, similar disruptions
were staged at other churches in this rusting steel mill valley.
   As the hostilities escalated, Roth's congregation sought and won
his removal. Refusing to leave, he was arrested at Trinity
Lutheran's altar in November 1984 and jailed for 112 days for civil
contempt of court.
   Because of the turmoil, the synod's executive board ordered the
60-year-old stone church locked and the 145-member congregation
disbanded. Koehler arrived in September 1986, and the new parish
was organized last October.
   Koehler's first sermon touched on forgiveness, although he
``didn't beat it to the ground.''
   He's since had his own faith and patience sorely tested. He said
the words ``Scab Pastor'' have been spray-painted on church
property, glue has been squeezed into door locks, a stained glass
window was shattered by a rock, and an outside gas meter
mysteriously was turned off one bitterly cold night.
   ``I was prepared for a lot worse than has happened,'' Koehler
said. ``I brainwashed myself before I came here that I was not
going to let their nonsense get to me.''
   While the DMX has not claimed responsibility for the vandalism,
Roth acknowledged ``people are still upset that this abomination of
church is there. They're just reacting to the removal of this valid
ministry.''
   He's appealing the synod executive board's decision to declare
the congregation defunct. He's also appealing two jail sentences
that are pending as a result of past protests.
   ``I will be back as an ordained pastor. I will be at Trinity
without a doubt,'' he said, nodding emphatically. ``It's just a
matter of how much more do they want to lose before I win.''

<HEAD>Film Teaches Safe Sex to Retarded Adults</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Retarded men and women around the nation are
being shown an explicit videotape about sex in hopes it will help
keep them safe from AIDS.
   The video uses startling illustrations _ including still
photographs of surrogates in specific sexual positions.
   ``You can't generalize or use words. They don't know what you're
talking about,'' explained Alice Rose, program director of the
Cerebral Palsy Association of San Francisco, which will present the
video at 12 group homes.
   ``Their ability to abstract information is impaired,'' added
Rebecca Porper, a public health educator from the New York City
Department of Health who appears in the film. ``You have to deal
absolutely in black and white, with no grays, and it has to be
reiterated in several ways, preferably multi-sensory.''
   The Young Adult Institute, the non-profit agency that created
the 17-minute video, with help from the city health department,
acknowledges the idea offends some people.
   ``Someone called from Iowa and said, `How dare you put
homosexuals on the tape?''' said Perry Samowitz, the institute's
training director. ``We don't want to come across as crazy liberals
from New York who are promoting promiscuity. But what are the
alternatives? We don't want our clients to die _ no matter who
gives us flak.''
   The main goal is ``to make sure a condom is worn'' if a retarded
adult decides to have sex, Samowitz said.
   For Tina Mills, who has Down's syndrome and lives with 14 other
mildly retarded people in their 20s and 30s at a suburban Yonkers
apartment building, talking about AIDS is scary. But after she saw
the video, she said, ``I tried to urge that (condom use) to a
friend at the workshop.''
   ``There are times I don't really want to talk about it or think
about it,'' agreed fellow resident Dan Sigman. ``It's kind of
painful, but it's better to learn all about it. AIDS kills.''
   No statistics indicate how many AIDS victims are retarded,
according to Chuck Fallis, spokesman for the federal Centers for
Disease Control. Ms. Porper said she knew of eight AIDS cases among
the retarded in the metropolitan area, and a retarded New Yorker
died last year of AIDS contracted through a blood transfusion,
according to Lou Ganim, a spokesman for the state Office of Mental
Health and Developmental Disabilities.
   The risk of AIDS is no less real for the retarded. And so the
film is explicit.
   In one photograph, male surrogates are positioned as if they
were about to engage in anal sex so viewers can understand the link
between that practice and AIDS. Oral sex and the use of condoms in
heterosexual intercourse are also illustrated.
   ``I'm sure we'll get one or two people who will go bananas about
it,'' said Ms. Rose. ``A small proportion of people do not believe
that their children, whether adults or not, have a right to be
active or have knowledge of sexual activity.''
   ``I don't dare bring it up with my parents,'' said Abbie Colpoys
of the Yonkers group home.
   ``My parents talk a lot about that kind of thing. They warn me
about what could happen to me,'' said Ms. Mills. ``I say, `Ma,
please _ I can take care of myself. I care about myself.'''
   Teachers stress in group discussions that the film is not
intended to advocate any act, and that abstinence is acceptable.
Role-playing is included to help participants refuse unsafe sex.
   ``It teaches them how to be sensitive and relate to people in a
caring, responsible way,'' said Joel M. Levy, executive director of
the YAI, which runs 50 programs for the retarded in the New York
area, including 24 group homes.
   Group home residents also practice putting condoms on a plastic
penis and are told to use condoms themselves, even when it's not
clear where a romantic moment will lead.
   ``The mildly and moderately retarded know their judgment is
impaired,'' said Ms. Porper. ``If you give them a choice they are
incapable of making _ like when to put on a condom _ it raises
tremendous anxieties in them.''
   Some professionals have qualms about the film's approach.
   ``I think the general feeling of our staff is that it was too
negative, too scary,'' said Cathy Berger, prevention specialist
with the Wisconsin Council on Developmental Disabilities. YAI sent
the tape to 150 agencies, and the Wisconsin council was among five
that returned it, said Samowitz.
   ``They (the filmmakers) see this as a very serious issue and
their intent is to make people aware of it by scaring them. We're
concerned about that approach,'' said Ms. Berger.
   It also concerns Yonkers group home resident Sandy Mintzer. She
and her boyfriend understand safe sex, but cannot use condoms
because of poor hand coordination _ a problem for some retarded
people.
   ``It's hard to talk about because it's scary,'' said Ms.
Mintzer, who adamantly refused to see the film a second time.
   ``Sometimes, denial is an easier way of dealing with scary
feelings,'' the residential supervisor, Laura Eldridge, told others
in the group. ``But I don't feel it's healthy.''
   Some members of the Wisconsin council also were bothered by the
film's explicit nature or felt that it ``left some questions that
might confuse people,'' said Ms. Berger.
   They agree the retarded need AIDS education, she said. ``But
it's not like there's a canned program that works for everybody.
Agencies have different perspectives, and communities have
different attitudes.''
   The film is out of the question for Roman Catholic programs for
the retarded because of religious doctrine against condoms and
premarital sex, said Monsignor James Cassidy, director of health
and hospitals for the New York Archdiocese.
   ``We'd be against it purely from the medical point of view,''
said Cassidy. ``Condoms fail. If we relied solely on condoms, we'd
have every darn one of the females pregnant.''
   Instead, abstinence is taught to the 350 retarded adults served
through archdiocese programs. ``It's just a reinforcement of what
we've been doing all along,'' said Cassidy.
   Ganim, the spokesman for the New York mental health office, felt
ambivalent about the film.
   ``I certainly know it's explicit and some people have expressed
concerns about that,'' he said. ``But by and large, what we have
heard back about the tape has been positive. They've brought up the
fact that there is a need for this kind of thing.''
   Dr. Lloyd Kolbe, chief of the CDC's Office of School Health and
Special Projects, said no one has studied what kind of AIDS
information is available for the retarded and what might be
effective.
   Kolbe said CDC guidelines issued in January suggested that
schools address the issue of AIDS education for the disabled.
   ``We need to think about it,'' said Kolbe. ``The questions, I
think, are important ones.''
   ``It's not like you should just forget about it and pretend AIDS
doesn't exist,'' said Lauren Hoffman, a resident at the group home.
``A woman has to be prepared.''

   Rod Matthews was a sullen, introverted boy,
fascinated with death, obsessed with fire. Shaun Ouillette was
outgoing and happy; he played hockey and talked of counseling
troubled youths.
   Sixteen months ago Matthews beat Ouillette to death with a
baseball bat. Last month the 15-year-old was found guilty of
second-degree murder and given life in prison.
   The horrible crime wasn't the only link between murderer and
victim. Both took Ritalin, a stimulant used to calm hyperactive
children.
   And while the trial served as a stage to the debate over the
drug, it also provided testimony on how Ritalin, in combination
with other treatment, can help children, and how its casual use can
allow deeper problems to go undetected.
   Matthews' attorney, John Philip White, claimed the drug nudged
the boy into the madness it took to plan and commit murder. The
Citizens Commission on Human Rights, an anti-psychiatry group
connected with the Church of Scientology, trumpeted the case as an
example of the dangers it associates with the drug.
   A stream of psychiatrists and psychologists gave offsetting
testimony. Defense witnesses said Matthews was psychotic, that the
Ritalin ``enhanced'' his obsession to kill. Prosecution witnesses
said the boy's emotional problems were not enough to obscure his
notion of right and wrong. Ritalin, they said, played no factor.
   Ironically, Ouillette's mother, Jeanne Quinn, says Ritalin
helped her son, calming him enough to allow the counseling and
therapy that taught him how to control himself.
   Guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics say Ritalin
should be prescribed after detailed diagnosis and used only in
combination with counseling and careful monitoring. According to
testimony, Matthews received Ritalin without other therapy.
   His mother, Janet, portrayed him as a quiet child who said
little more than yes or no in his early years. When he became a
behavioral problem in the third grade, a pediatrican prescribed
Ritalin.
   Mrs. Matthews said there were no special psychological or
physical tests, no monitoring of her son's progress over the next
five years.
   Mrs. Matthews said her son went off the drug a few months before
the killing, then asked for more pills a few weeks later. A bottle
of Ritalin was found in his school locker; no one knows if he was
taking the drug at the time of the killing.
   In contrast, Mrs. Quinn said her son ``went through all kinds of
tests'' before he was diagnosed as hyperactive and given Ritalin at
age 7.
   She said she attended sessions for parents with hyperactive
children, watched her son's diet and diverted his energies into
activities like hockey and bicycling.
   After four years, Ouillette was weaned from the drug.
   ``We had taught him to learn self-discipline and self-control,''
she said.
   White said the effect Ritalin had on his client remains a
mystery, but he believes that reliance on the drug, instead of
testing and therapy, played a role in the tragedy.
   ``The whole affair was a lost opportunity to spot a potential
problem,'' he said. ``As a result, we've got one boy in prison and
another boy dead.''

   One hyperactive student is greatly helped by
Ritalin, so the teacher encourages the parents of others to try it
_ and they tell other parents about the happy results. Ritalin's
success many have led to its excess: some fear it's now overused.
The second story in a three-day series, `R' is for Ritalin, looks
at the increased role of a prescribed drug in the nation's schools.

   Something new is tucked amid the workbooks, pencils and
sandwiches in an increasing number of school backpacks each day. It
is a pill, no bigger than button candy, prescribed to help
youngsters get through their multiplication tables, spelling tests
and geography lessons.
   The pill is Ritalin, a stimulant that can assist hyperactive
children in concentrating, completing their work and controlling
frenzied outbursts that turn classrooms to chaos.
   Some parents describe Ritalin as a godsend.
   ``It was like the difference between day and night,'' said Nancy
Anderson, a Buffalo, Minn., mother whose daughter, 11, and son, 8,
take the drug. ``The first day Sarah took Ritalin was the first
time she was able to read something and understand it. That night
she told me and started crying.
   ``I cried, too.''
   But Ritalin's success may be leading to its excess. As many as 1
million children may take the drug, and happy endings like the
Andersons' are encouraging more doctors to prescribe it, sometimes
with less triumphant results.
   Many doctors say superficial diagnosis and limited follow-up
have led to the medicating of the children who don't need it, or
who need additional counseling to learn how to tame the confusion
inside their minds.
   ``I know of several communities and school districts where
people are excessively prescribing medication for children without
adequately evaluating them,'' said Russell Barkely, director of
psychology at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.
Barkely said these communities to the west and north of Boston
``may be seeing the children once a year and renewing the
prescription by telephone.''
   The five states with the highest per-capita consumption of
Ritalin _ Utah, Maryland, Georgia, Minnesota and Michigan _ have
begun investigating its use.
   Georgia officials alarmed by high Ritalin use in suburban
Atlanta found school personnel were urging Ritalin treatment on
parents.
   ``We looked at what was driving the marketplace and wound up
with the conclusion that it was the school systems,'' said Andrew
Watry, executive director of Georgia's Composite State Board of
Medical Examiners. ``Parents were calling us with a lot of
anecdotal information about how their arms were twisted to take the
medication.''
   LaVarne Parker, a suburban Atlanta mother, believes Ritalin is
used as a chemical billy club to subdue problem students. She has
filed suit against the doctor and school officials who encouraged
her to medicate her son.
   ``It's almost like someone said we've got a pill to give a child
who won't do what you want him to do,'' she said.
   When Susan Marshall's son, Bradley, had trouble in first-grade
at Hingham, Mass., she sought medical help on the school's advice.
Her pediatrian prescribed Ritalin.
   But Bradley did not improve and, according to his mother,
suffered from insomnia, depression and a loss of appetite. Mrs.
Marshall finally took Bradley to a neurologist who found the boy's
problems were due to a hemiparesis, a limited brain injury not
treatable by Ritalin.
   The Marshalls are suing the pediatrician.
   ``He simply prescribed Ritalin,'' she said. ``We were not given
a diagnosis.''
   Parents like Mrs. Marshall and Mrs. Parker claim Ritalin carries
harsh side effects, from facial tics and lost appetite to
depression and suicide. Their anxieties are fed by the Citizens
Commission on Human Rights _ a group, supported by the Church of
Scientology, that opposes psychiatric treatment and is conducting a
nationwide media campaign against Ritalin.
   Doctors and government regulators dismiss most charges against
Ritalin as exaggerated and unsubstantiated, citing some 500
research papers that mostly agree side effects are temporary and
minimal.
   Manufactured by Ciba-Geigy Corp. and known generically as
methylphenidate, Ritalin is one in a small group of drugs used to
treat childhood behavioral disorders and narcolepsy. As a Class II
drug, it is listed, along with amphetamines, morphine and the
painkiller Demerol, as a drug with legitimate use but high
potential for abuse.
   Prescribing drugs for problem children is not new. The Roman
physican Galen suggested opium for overactive children in the first
century. Research in the 1930s indicated that treating hyperactive
children with stimulants, usually amphetamines, helped calm them.
Ritalin was developed in 1955 as an alternative to amphetamines.
   What has changed in the last decade is the awareness _ some say
overawareness _ of the malady that Ritalin is used to treat.
   Known variously over years as hyperactivity, hyperkinesis and
minimal brain disfunction, the syndrome is now called attention
deficit disorder, a catch-all of symptoms ranging from wild,
destructive behavior to an inability to concentrate or, in
educational jargon, ``stay on task.''
   Researchers say 3 to 10 percent of the nation's 45 million
schoolchildren exhibit some symptoms of ADD.
   The American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic bible lists
ADD symptoms such as fidgeting, difficulty awaiting turns at games,
blurting out answers before being called on, excessive talking and
a penchant for losing things.
   While many parents would recognize some of these noisome habits
in their children, ADD parents say it is the intensity of the
behavior that separates theirs from normal children.
   ``It's the constantness of it,'' said Jean Conner Harrison, a
West Newbury, Mass., mother who publishes a newsletter for ADD
families. ``You are trapped in it. You can't take these children
anywhere, you can't get babysitters to stay with them. It is so
emotionally tough to get through this day by day.''
   ADD is the single most researched area of child psychology. Some
600 research papers on the subject were published last year. ADD
seminars are commonly held around the country for doctors,
educators and parents.
   Regional diagnostic clinics have sprung up, often near research
centers in states with high Ritalin use. As a result, more and more
children are being diagnosed with ADD and treated with medication.
   Critics note with alarm that Ritalin production has doubled
since 1983. But the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which
sets production levels, says that statistic sheds little light on
how many people take a drug.
   A better gauge is number of prescriptions. An FDA report shows
2.2 million prescriptions for Ritalin and related drugs were filled
and refilled in 1986. The figure does not show the number of people
using the drug, but it does indicate an increase in use _ the
number is 14 percent higher than in 1983.
   ``That's unusual,'' said Carlene Baum, an FDA psychologist.
``The average annual increase in prescriptions for most drugs is 1
percent.''
   No one is certain how many of the nation's children get a daily
dose of Ritalin. Daniel Safer, a Johns Hopkins University child
psychiatrist who has studied surveys at various school districts,
believes 600,000 to 800,000 schoolchildren receive stimulant
medication, mostly Ritalin.
   ``It's been going up steadily,'' said Safer, ``and I don't see
it going down.''

   In 1971, 1.1 percent of Baltimore County school students were
taking Ritalin, Safer said. By 1983, the number was up to 3.5
percent.
   ``The increase is a multiple of factors: parent-teacher
satisfaction, the ease of treatment and its relative success,'' he
said.
   Most Maryland school districts recommend parents seek medical
help only after teachers, counselors and administrators have met to
discuss a problem student.
   ``We don't prescribe Ritalin,'' said Robert Dubel,
superintendent of the Baltimore County School District. ``All we do
is refer children to medical help, the same as we would if a child
had problems seeing a blackboard. We would tell the parents and
they would have the child's eyes examined.''
   Yet when Baltimore County officials, threatened with a lawsuit,
reviewed their policy late last year, they found such a measured
response was not always the case.
   ``I am convinced that we probably do have some people out there
who sidestep some of the procedures and say `You have to get that
child on Ritalin,''' said Thomas Farley, an assistant county
attorney.
   In Georgia, Watry, the director of the medical examiners' board,
tells of one school counselor who would ``pressure parents on a
mass scale to use Ritalin.''
   ``He told parents he was playing the percentages because it had
helped with so many cases,'' said Watry.
   Late last year a special study group for the Georgia Department
of Education recommended school personnel be warned against
``pressuring'' parents to seek medication and leave diagnosis and
treatment to medical professionals.
   But often these professionals are not doing a complete job.
   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends extensive testing
and discussion among doctors, parents and educators before
prescribing medication.
   Guidelines also stress that medication is only part of the
solution. Counseling, therapy, tutoring, even special classes for
parents are recommended.
   ``Almost everybody in the field will say you have to do more
than give the pill,'' said James Satterfield, a Los Angeles-area
psychiatrist whose research found hyperactive children responded
dramatically better to a combination of therapy and Ritalin.
   ``We've heard about pediatricians who have said, `Here's six
months of prescription, come back when it runs out,''' he said.
``That gives a message to parents that here's this magic pill, you
don't need any other treatment.''
   But some question if many of those getting treatment need it.
   Thomas Long, a psychologist and director of the National Center
for Family Studies at the Catholic University of America, believes
doctors choose medication when counseling and different parenting
might be enough.
   ``We have created a society that relies on medication to solve
our problems,'' he said. ``The first thing you go to when you have
a problem is some kind of pill.''

<TEXT>
   Each weekday morning our 7-year-old son Tom
starts breakfast with a tiny white tablet he calls his ``daydream
pill.''
   The pill has become part of our daily routine. There was a time
when my wife and I, people who think twice before taking aspirin,
would have been incredulous had you told us we'd be giving our
child a behavior-modifying drug.
   As Tom grew into an active toddler, he gave no indication
anything was amiss; we were sure he was a superstar. With blond
curls and a sturdy well-coordinated body, he was quick and good at
everything: an early walker and talker, a cheerful elf full of
eager questions.
   But by the time Tom was ready for kindergarten, we were
concerned. He couldn't seem to keep his mind on a task. He didn't
like to play alone, and he didn't stay with an activity for more
than a few minutes.
   We hoped it was just immaturity. Perhaps we had spoiled him?
   With his quick mind and pleasing personality, Tom drifted
through kindergarten. We wondered why he wasn't picking up academic
skills as quickly as we'd anticipated, but his school reports were
generally good and he was having a good year with soccer and T-ball.
   Everything changed in first grade. He was one of 30 classmates,
and most of the school day required independent seatwork.
   We realized something was very wrong when Tom began collapsing
into tantrums of free-floating rage and frustration after school.
We were completely taken aback, especially because we had high
confidence in his small, caring school.
   We were mystified by our little soccer player's rage. At what?
Was it the oversized class?
   The school principal assured us that, although the class was
large, the children were doing fine.
   We spoke to psychologist friends about whether some deep-seated
anxiety could be surfacing.
   Tom himself was unable to give us any clues until one night in
the midst of an emotional collapse, he said, over and over, ``I'm
dumb.''
   Fortunately for us all, Tom's class took a group intelligence
test about this time. Tom's score was so high in comparison with
his performance that the principal called us in. She wanted to do
further testing and mentioned ``attention deficit,'' a term that
seemed to fit the child we knew.
   The principal also mentioned Ritalin, saying she had seen
dramatic changes in kids like Tom. We were appalled by the
suggestion we give our boy a drug, skeptical that this was the
proper way to approach a learning problem.
   Instead, we tried a highly publicized diet and spent an
agonizing month keeping Tom from many of his favorite foods, ones
with cyclamates and additives. The stress of the diet increased
Tom's rage and frustration.
   We next urged the school to institute behavioral techniques,
such as rewarding Tom for even brief periods of concentration.
These helped, but only moderately, and we started to reconsider.
   After reading all the research we could find, and considering
the side effects (such as the possibility Tom would be one-quarter
inch shorter as an adult), we concluded the risks of trying Ritalin
were minimal.
   A factor in our decision was our own dependence on our morning
cups of coffee, which help us get going and stay focused. Were we
depriving Tom of the equivalent of a morning cup of coffee?
   The pediatrician said Tom might temporarily lose his appetite or
have trouble sleeping. None of this happened, and Tom was
surpringly amenable to taking the tiny pill.
   Indeed, Tom was the first to let us know it was making some
difference. He started calling it his ``daydream pill,'' saying it
helped him control the daydreams that distracted him in class. His
teacher soon reported his behavior was improving, and we saw this
reflected in his school work.
   Still, we couldn't be certain it wasn't just a placebo effect on
Tom and the teacher.
   This year, with a new teacher who shared our lingering
reservations, we withheld the Ritalin for a couple of weeks.
Simultaneously, Tom and his teacher reported he couldn't
concentrate and urged us to return to the pill.
   With the increased demands of second grade, Tom has begun taking
an additional 5 milligrams at lunch. Occasionally, when he's having
trouble staying with his homework, he'll say, ``Maybe I should take
a pill.'' Last week we filled yet another prescription at the
pharmacy where we are now recognized as regulars.
   Last month, Tom proudly brought home a report card with B's in
math and English and A's _ his first ever _ in reading and
spelling. In categories such as deportment, handwriting and follows
directions, which last year produced a string of F's for failure
and N's for non-satisfactory, there were 2 N's and 13 S's _ for
satisfactory.
   Is Ritalin a panacea? No. Even with the pill, Tom's attention
deficit still requires the guidance of a skillful teacher.
   Are we comfortable about him taking medicine? Yes and no.
   We like the results but are uncomfortable treating a symptom,
the cause of which no one knows. We are especially uncomfortable
that the psychologists and doctors seem unconcerned why Tom has
trouble paying attention.
   Will we keep giving him the pill? Yes, at least while Tom thinks
it's helpful. We'll also keep trying to find a deeper understanding
of what's involved.
   As Tom says, ``It's not perfect, but it works, some.''

<HEAD>Parents Beware: Diagnosing ADD Difficult, Treatment Complex</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-R Is for Ritalin II</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For parents facing a decision on whether to medicate a child
with Ritalin, psychiatrists and pediatricians offer some advice:
Make sure the diagnosis is made carefully and the treatment
involves more than just taking pills.
   Ritalin is commonly prescribed for hyperactive children with
attention deficit disorder, but too often they are diagnosed
without proper testing and evaluation, they say.
   And if a treatment does not include counseling and educational
therapies, it probably is faulty, the experts add.
   ``I think there are children given the drug who do not have
ADD,'' said Dr. Jerry Wiener, president of the American Academy of
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. ``And if they do, drugs alone are
not going to resolve that. Very often mistakes are made of making
the diagnosis and then only prescribing the drug.''
   Parents, Wiener said, should expect five things of their
physician:
   _ A complete and thorough diagnosis.
   _ Information about possible side effects.
   _ Close monitoring of the effects of medication through regular
visits.
   _ Information about alternative treatments.
   _ An explanation of the consequences if medication is not used.
   ``If the physician does not do these things, parents have every
reason ... to seek medical help elsewhere,'' Wiener said.
   The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders says an ADD diagnosis must
include signs of inattention and impulsivity, as well as onset
before age 7 and duration of at least six months. Other disorders
must be ruled out.
   An ADD study group appointed by the Georgia Department of
Education called ADD ``one of the most time-consuming of the
disorders of childhood to evaluate.''
   Dr. Michael Levine, a San Antonio, Texas, child hyperactivity
expert, said he spends two hours taking history and 10 hours
testing before making an ADD diagnosis.
   ``When you see Johnny staring out the window or bouncing off the
walls, you don't know if he's off-task because of a brain filter
problem (treatable with Ritalin), a learning disability or a
behavioral problem,'' Levine said.
   Once an ADD diagnosis is made, experts say, too often the child
is treated only with medications such as Ritalin _ the prescribed
way to go until as recently as 1970. The latest research shows that
a more effective treatment combines medication with therapy and
counseling.
   ``Everyone agrees that you have to do something more than give a
pill,'' said Dr. James Satterfield of Encino, Calif., who pioneered
some ADD research. ``In the real world, most of the children get
one treatment, seldom two, never three _ and the most common would
be medication.''

   Daily doses of the drug Ritalin are increasingly
the treatment of choice for children diagnosed with attention
deficit disorder. Not surprisingly, more and more clinics are
specializing in such diagnosis and treatment. And schools are often
enthusiastic about Ritalin's success. Two stories offer inside
looks at one such clinic, where an 11-year-old girl learned she
would begin what might be years of Ritalin therapy, and at a school
where teachers credit Ritalin with helping children conquer their
emotional and academic despair. A third story looks at Utah, the
state with the youngest population, a reputation for moral
conservatism _ and the highest per capita use of Ritalin in the
nation.

   Her school principal had urged her mother to make
the four-hour drive from rural northern Michigan. Now 11-year-old
Chrissie sat in a tiny, windowless office where a psychologist
peppered her with questions.
   The morning would end with doctors at the Attention Deficit
Disorder Clinic of Children's Hospital telling Chrissie her
baffling problems at home and in school would mean treatment with
the stimulant Ritalin, quite likely for years.
   But first doctors tested Chrissie: spelling tests, math tests,
reading tests, questions about her family life. They probed her
moods, whether she ever felt like committing suicide (``once or
twice,'' she said.) They examined her school grades, read reports
from teachers.
   They even had Chrissie, a sliver-thin, pretty girl with straight
blond hair, draw a picture of herself. The 2-inch-high sketch spoke
volumes to the psychologist about the youngster's poor self-image.
   Finally the psychologist asked Chrissie for three wishes.
   ``A horse ranch,'' the girl said after several moments. ``A
happy life. And people who care who can help me through this tough
time.
   ``I haven't really been happy since I was 2 or so. I yell at my
parents. Later I wish I hadn't done it. They're very good to me. So
I haven't had a very happy life.''
   Chrissie, which is not the girl's real name, indeed had many
problems, the doctors concluded. But she hardly fit the popular,
often mistaken, stereotype of children who take Ritalin.
   First, boys are eight times more likely than girls to be
diagnosed as having ADD. Second, Chrissie wasn't ``bouncing off the
walls.'' In fact, many youngsters recommended for Ritalin treatment
are not discipline problems and appear calm in most situations.
   Chrissie, said psychologist Arthur Robin, is ``a classic case of
a kid whose ADD was not caught as a young kid.'' Pre-adolescents
and teen-agers who unexplainedly struggle with school for years
often arrive at ADD clinics deeply depressed as a result of their
attention problems.
   The key was her inability to complete tasks and concentrate.
Tests suggested she was weak in math, easily frustrated,
dangerously depressed, and had a poor self-image.
   Chrissie knows she has troubles. ``I have quite a problem paying
attention in school. I've had it since kindergarten,'' she told a
visitor in a brief break from testing. ``I sometimes just have to
get out of my seat. I go to the drinking fountain, and I'm not even
thirsty. It's weird.
   ``If I have a problem, I'd really like to know about it.''
   Fewer than 100 such ADD clinics operate around the country,
according to Wade Horn, a psychologist who heads one at Children's
Hospital National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Nearly all
start with the assumption that ADD is essentially a physiological
disease that in most cases can be treated chemically.
   Some clinics simply juggle prescriptions, using placebos and
Ritalin or other stimulant drugs alternately to find the most
effective treatment. They leave the followup and monitoring to
others, often the family pediatrician.
   Others, like the Detroit clinic, employ pediatricians,
psychologists and social workers to look at the child in totality.
That means that counseling and changes in lessons or surroundings
are often part of the treatment. But at the heart of these clinics
is the conviction that Ritalin therapy helps most patients.
   Since it opened in September 1986, the ADD Clinic here has
examined some 600 patients and has a three-month waiting list, said
Dr. Sheldon Brenner, a pediatrician and co-director of the clinic.
At least three-quarters were diagnosed as having ADD, and about 85
percent of those were placed on medication, usually Ritalin.
   Once treatment begins, doctors rely on teacher questionnaires,
report cards and parents to monitor whether Ritalin is helping the
child in school and whether it is having side effects.
   Chrissie's teacher wrote this description of her on a Conners
Questionnaire, the standardized form used to evaluate children
suspected of having attention deficit disorder:
   ``Chrissie is not a behavior problem,'' her teacher wrote. ``I
just do not have her attention 90 percent of the time. ... On the
day we had our first bit of snow last fall, I was trying to help
her understand something. She looked at me and smiled, saying `I
wonder what my kitten thinks of snow? She never saw it before.'
Sometimes it seems her mind is way off somewhere else.''
   Chrissie and her mother sat expressionless as the doctors later
told them that Ritalin and psychological counseling ``should make a
difference.''
   Her mother expressed mild surprise over the prescription.
``Ritalin has a bad name,'' she said after the doctors had left the
room. ``I was somewhat surprised because I associated Ritalin with
hyperactivity.''
   How is Chrissie doing? After six weeks of Ritalin and
counseling, Chrissie's teachers told doctors she had shown mild
improvement in attention span and a marked improvement in her
ability to sit still and stick to school work. Even with an
increase in dosage, to 30 milligrams a day, she has exhibited no
side effects.
   Progress, but no quick miracles, then, for Chrissie. The Ritalin
therapy continues.

   One of Jane Easton's pupils takes
the drug Ritalin to calm his hyperactivity and help him pay
attention. She challenged a visitor to guess who.
   Chris was the obvious choice. Seated with three other boys at a
semicircular desk in a special education class at Scotch Elementary
School, the third-grader fidgeted in his chair, got up several
times to sharpen his pencil, drummed his fingers, asked questions
repeatedly and never seemed to hear the answers.
   The guess was wrong. Instead, the child on Ritalin was a slender
boy with flaming red hair who calmly sailed through a reading
comprehension quiz and listened attentively to a lesson on
homonyms. Easton says he's doing so well he probably will leave
handicapped classes forever in the fall.
   At Scotch Elementary, they believe in Ritalin _ and teachers
point to cases like these to vindicate their faith in the
controversial drug.
   Far from thinking Ritalin creates passive ``zombies,'' as some
critics have charged, teachers and parents alike in this affluent
northwest Detroit suburb seem convinced of Ritalin's track record
for turning emotional and academic despair into success.
   Grades and attention span often improve, and some youngsters who
might have spent entire school careers isolated in classes for the
disabled have managed to rejoin their regular peers with the help
of the drug.
   Most of all, teachers like Easton resent the assertion by some
that Ritalin is merely a cynical way for schools to silence problem
children while claiming they are trying to help them.
   ``I read that this is the way we treat kids we can't handle.
It's not true. It's just not true,'' said Easton, whose daughter
has taken the drug for four years.
   While an estimated 1-2 percent of the nation's 40 million
schoolchildren take Ritalin, Dr. Paul H. Wender, a Salt Lake City
psychiatrist and author of several books on attention deficit
disorder, or ADD, believes 3-to-10 percent of all children have
hyperactivity problems.
   At Scotch Elementary, approximately 5 percent of the 550 pupils
drop by principal Carl Childress's office each day to take a pill.
   Several elements help explain why Ritalin is commonplace at
Scotch Elementary; teachers and school administrators have attended
seminars and taken other training to recognize symptoms of ADD.
Area doctors are not only willing to prescribe Ritalin but also to
work with teachers and schools to monitor its success. And parents
generally seem to accept the professionalism, good faith and
judgment of the teachers and doctors.
   ``When you first start talking to parents about this, they're
devastated,'' said principal Carl Childress. ``Then 90 percent
react that it is a medical problem.''
   Childress tells of a youngster named George who has taken
Ritalin for two years. He had been assigned to a ``resource room,''
where handicapped children get individual instruction for part of
each day.
   ``He had an incident every day of losing his temper, punching
someone or screaming in vile terms,'' said Childress. ``Now he's
out of special education. He's a winner.''
   Childress, like other educators, insists ``we never recommend
medication.'' But that's only partly true. If the school's
psychologist, social worker or reading specialist believes a child
has ADD, they know which doctors will nearly always prescribe
Ritalin.
   At the top of the list is Dr. Ruth Robin, a pediatrician who
operates the Attention Deficit Center in nearby Southfield, Mich.
Schools from all over Michigan and northern Ohio recommend her, and
prospective patients often wait 6-8 weeks for an appointment. She
now treats 1,500 youngsters for ADD, some as young as 3. Almost
invariably, she prescribes Ritalin or similar medication.
   ``I work magic with the medicine,'' she said in an interview in
her office. ``I'm willing to try things.
   ``We're talking about large numbers of kids who are getting a
bum steer in life, from kindergarten on. Some look like couch
potatoes. They don't all look alike,'' she said.
   But even Ritalin's advocates admit it isn't always
well-monitored. Teachers are supposed to provide crucial
information enabling doctors to set the right dosage, or to
determine if drugs are necessary at all to academic success.
   Such monitoring is frequent when medication first begins. After
that, ``there really isn't that much to do unless there's a
problem,'' the doctor said.
   Childress said Robin and other ADD specialists typically send
teachers questionnaires to fill out for the first 2-4 weeks of
medication, then gradually less frequently until ``we feel we're on
a steady course. At a certain point we step out of the picture
unless the teacher notices a problem.''
   Still, Ritalin remains a ``last resort,'' said Childress.
Teachers might, for example, put distractible children in study
carrels _ desks with three sides blocked off so the child can't see
in front or to either side.
   But when ``we've exhausted all those things ... logged the
classroom observations,'' Childress said, ``we would just as soon
get a recommendation to try something else.''

   Utah is a state of large, close-knit
families whose religion frowns on the use of liquor and caffeine.
It is also a state with the nation's largest appetite for the
stimulant drug Ritalin.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration said that in 1986 pharmacies
along the state's Wasatch Front received 25,000 grams of the drug
used for hyperactive children, or 1,558 grams for every 100,000
population.
   That figure compares to 1,218 grams per 100,000 residents of
Maryland, the next highest Ritalin state. In New York, the figure
was 347 grams per 100,000.
   The reasons for Utah's high use of Ritalin are many. They may
point the way for the future in other parts of the country.
   ``What we are doing here is, in some ways, ahead of many parts
of the country,'' said Paul Wender, a psychiatrist and researcher
at the University of Utah.
   Utah has the youngest population of any state, with nearly a
quarter of its residents aged 5 to 17. It also leads the nation in
the size of individual families, about 4.3 children per household.
   Consequently it has the nation's most crowded classrooms with
24.6 students per teacher. Although Utah ranks near the top of the
list in the amount of state money, 47 percent, going to education,
it is last in per capita spending on education, at $2,372 per
student.
   So when the fragile balance in these overcrowded classrooms is
threatened by disruptive children, ``the pressures on parents and
teachers are going to lead people to look for solutions ... and one
of the solutions is medication,'' said Stevan Kukic, state director
of special education.
   In the Salt Lake School District, an estimated 2 percent of the
60,000 students receive Ritalin or one of its cousins for attention
deficit disorder, a syndrome that includes hyperactive as well as
inattentive pupils.
   ``It is becoming more acceptable in the parents' minds and the
teachers' minds,'' said Julie Miller, a special education teacher
whose son takes Ritalin. ``When the teachers see the dramatic
effect it can have on problem students, they want them medicated so
they can learn.''
   Sam Goldstein, a psychologist who saw 100 ADD children at his
clinic last year, estimates a quarter of his patients are referred
by the schools. Another 25 percent come at the suggestion of other
parents whose children take Ritalin. Half his patients were sent by
pediatricans.
   Utah's medical community also contributes to Ritalin use.
Reseachers at the University of Utah are considered leaders in ADD
study. Their philosophies are passed on to their students, many of
whom later set up practice nearby.
   As a result, Salt Lake has three clinics that specialize in the
diagnosis and treatment of ADD children _ many larger cities across
the country have none. Psychologists, psychiatrists and
pediatricians share information and refer patients for treatment.
   ``In a community this size it is easier to make an impact with
an idea, especially an idea that appeals to people,'' said
Goldstein.
   Parents of ADD children describe their successes with Ritalin as
more than appealing. Kathy Miner cries when she talks about the
effect Ritalin has had on her 11-year-old son, Jeremy.
   ``There has been such a remarkable change in this child,'' she
said. ``From the time he was 7 he talked about suicide. Now he's on
the student council and is so thrilled with life.''
   Mrs. Miner has joined others in a local support group for ADD
parents. The gatherings can be emotional: laughter about the
bruises and stitches their children have collected while rocketing
around the house, tears as they talk about the difference treatment
has brought.
   ``I wanted to share the knowledge with other families,'' said
the group's founder, Terri Steineckert, whose son, Tyler, 11, has
taken Ritalin for more than a year. ``It is very traumatic to put a
child on drugs, but if you have a good experience, you're
converted,'' she said.

   Fifteen years since six members of the
Alday family were murdered on their farm, shock has turned to
bitter impatience as retrials of three defendants threaten to take
the case into the next decade.
   The retrials, ordered despite what a federal court called
obvious guilt, have burdened tiny, rural Seminole County.
   Tucked into Georgia's southwest corner and with just 9,500
people, Seminole County has about $1 million a year to spend. The
cost of the appeals is expected to exceed $600,000. Other counties
are holding the retrials, but they send their bills to Seminole,
the site of the murders.
   The second retrial, of Wayne Coleman, 41, starts Monday in
Decatur.
   Judicial juggling replaced questions of guilt or innocence years
ago, and that rankles here, where concepts of right and wrong are
stark and pure.
   Ned Alday, 62, his brother Aubrey, 57, and sons Jerry, 35,
Jimmy, 30, and Chester, 25, were shot to death in Jerry's trailer
as they arrived singly or in pairs May 14, 1973. Jerry's wife,
Mary, 26, was raped there, driven to a field six miles away, raped
and sodomized again and shot twice in the back.
   Their graves, marked by a $20,000 black marble slab, lie near a
cedar tree planted more than a century ago at Spring Hill Baptist
Church by Isaac Alday.
   An irrigation well stands on the site of the trailer 12 miles
from Donalsonville.
   But faded ``Remember The Aldays'' stickers remain on a few
vehicles, and in the local courthouse is a cartoon depicting the
appellate judges who overturned the convictions as the Three
Stooges. ``Remember them in May during `Respect For Law Week,'''
reads the caption.
   ``There won't be justice for the Alday family until (the
killers) all fry,'' said Eddie Gail, nursing a soft drink at the
local pool hall. ``The court found them guilty, they know they're
guilty, and that should be the end of it.''
   Coleman, then 26 years old, his half-brother Carl Isaacs, 19,
and George Dungee, 35,, all escapees from a Maryland prison farm,
were arrested in West Virginia shortly after the killings.
   Mary Alday's wristwatch was in Dungee's pocket. The men had
three of the weapons used to kill the Aldays. Coleman's confession
was read in court.
   The three were tried separately in Donalsonville and sentenced
in 1974 to die.
   Billy Isaacs, Carl's 15-year-old brother, had been picked up in
Baltimore County after the prison break. A witness to the murders,
he turned state's evidence and was sentenced to 40 years in prison.
   Billy testified that Carl laughed after killing Aubrey Alday.
``I asked him what was so funny,'' Billy recalled. ``He said, `That
bastard begged for mercy.'''
   He testified his brother shot four of the victims and that
Coleman and Dungee killed one each. Some of the Aldays were shot in
the head as many as seven times.
   In 1985 the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, while citing
``overwhelming evidence of ... guilt,'' ruled there also was
``overwhelming evidence that the community had prejudiced both
guilt and sentence.''
   A lower court had ruled that the convictions and sentences were
based on ``the overwhelmingly uncontroverted evidence of their
willful participation in what is generally regarded as the most
heinous criminal orgy in the history of the state.''
   But the appellate ruling held that the trials should have been
moved because of pre-trial publicity and inflammatory statements by
some officials. Failure to overturn the convictions, it said,
``would mean an obviously guilty defendant would have no right to a
fair trial.''
   More than 100,000 people signed petitions calling for the
impeachment of the three judges, but the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
their decision.
   ``The judges and lawyers that did that are the ones who should
be hung first,'' said Mel Johnson, who operates a crossroads store
not far from where the Aldays are buried.
   He said time had not dulled emotions.
   ``When people around here get to talking about it, they get so
mad they almost start to fight,'' he said. ``It's still very much
alive. And not a day goes by but what someone doesn't stop by here
and ask for directions to the cemetery, people from all walks of
life, some of them from as far as New York.''
   According to retrial testimony, the defendants were heading back
to Maryland from Florida in a stolen car. They were burglarizing
the trailer when Aldays started arriving.
   In 1977, Carl Isaacs, in a television documentary interview,
said the four were after money but didn't want to go back to jail.
``We figured that they couldn't take us back to prison if they
couldn't talk.''
   Isaacs was retried earlier this year in Perry, convicted and
sentenced again to death. Dungee will be retried in Columbus later.
   Meanwhile, the bills for everything from lawyers to false teeth
keep piling up.
   Since 1985, Seminole County has paid about $327,400, most of it
to other counties for lodging the prisoners, holding hearings,
transportation, security and lawyers' fees.
   County Clerk Bobby Nichols said costs for the Isaacs trial were
about $160,000, and he wasn't optimistic that costs for Coleman's
retrial would be lower.
   ``(Houston County, where Isaacs was tried) charged us $890 just
for opening and closing the courtroom. They called it extra
custodial service. When Isaacs needed a new suit to go to trial in,
we paid for that.''
   Coleman has no teeth. At a recent competency hearing, for which
Seminole County also paid, his lawyers asked that he be provided
dentures for the trial.
   ``In July of 1987, we provided him with upper and lower dentures
at a cost of $350,'' Nichols said with a frown. ``If it were up to
me he wouldn't get another set.''
   He said Seminole County is feeling the pinch.
   ``We have been able to continue basic services thus far,'' he
said. ``I don't know how much longer we will be able to. We depend
on agriculture here, and agriculture is in disarray with
foreclosures and all.''
   The county borrowed $210,000 so it could function while it paid
retrial costs.
   ``If we don't get a lot more help from the state it could leave
us in a very precarious way,'' he said. The state has paid $153,000
so far.
   Nichols said the cost of the initial trials was less than
$10,000, and each lasted less than a week. Lawyers say appeals
could last another decade.
   At Eds Pool Room, as in the rest of Donalsonville, memories of
the Aldays and the killings are becoming the stuff of legend.
   The small group gathered there remembered Ned Alday as a man who
could stretch facts to transparent thinness.
   ``But he only told lies on himself,'' said one patron quickly.
``They used to say about him that he had to hire (someone) to call
his hogs because he told so many lies his hogs wouldn't believe
him.''
   There was a silence.
   ``People liked Ned,'' Eddie Gail said. ``And those boys was good
boys, as far as I knew. And she was a good woman.''

<HEAD>Greece Follows Dukakis Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KERIN HOPE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MYTILENE, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' cousins in Greece like
to tell how his father ran away from his home on the Turkish
mainland to a merchant uncle who lived on the Greek island of
Mytilene, after being forbidden to leave for America.
   A telegram was sent home saying that young Panos was safe. ``And
the answer came, `Tie him up in a bundle if necessary and send him
back,''' said Elly Petridou, a retired bank employee who still
lives on the island.
   ``But my grandfather _ Panos' uncle _ knew the future lay in
America and didn't obey,'' she said. ``Instead, he found Panos an
English teacher and later on paid his fare from Mytilene to
America. ... And eventually his parents followed him there.''
   That was early in this century. Today, at least a few ``Mike
Dukakis-President'' stickers are showing up as far away from
America as this northern Aegean island where his father lived, as
Greek interest grows in the Massachusetts governor's campaign for
the White House.
   Greek television newscasts lead off with coverage of the U.S.
primaries, and Athens newspapers run front-page stories detailing
Dukakis' progress.
   Politicians and analysts discuss the 54-year-old Democrat's lack
of experience in foreign affairs. And they study his campaign
speeches for clues to what might be future American policy.
   Dukakis, in interviews with Greek media, stresses his Greek
heritage. But he avoids comment on eastern Mediterranean disputes
such as the Greek-Turkish disagreement over Aegean oil rights and
the divided island of Cyprus.
   A mix of pride and caution marks the mood among the half-dozen
cousins and their families who make up the Dukakis clan in Greece.
   ``We all think Mike is an exceptional person and we're convinced
he'll win the Democratic nomination. But that's still a long way
from getting to the White House,'' Patra Zourelli, a second cousin
who lives on Mytilene _ also known as Lesbos _ said in an interview.
   From a political standpoint in the United States, ``I can tell
you it's an advantage to be an immigrant's son,'' Dukakis was
recently quoted as telling the Athens daily Vrathyni. ``The
minorities see in me their children's opportunity to get ahead.''
   Dukakis' father, Panos, became a respected family doctor in
Brookline, Mass. His mother, Euterpe, now 83 and campaigning
actively for her son, was one of the first Greek-American women to
qualify as a teacher.
   ``Dukakis is probably unique in that his parents made it to the
professional classes. ... Usually it's the second generation which
makes that jump,'' Alexander Kitroeff, a historian who teaches at
Queens College, New York, said in a telephone interview.
   Dukakis' father was the youngest of four brothers who left
Greece as teen-agers in the early 1900s. It was a time when Greeks
flocked to America, working in textile factories, flower stalls and
shoeshine parlors to escape dire poverty at home.
   Mytilene, lying close to Turkey and covered with millions of
olive trees, boasts a literary tradition that began in the 7th
century B.C. with Sappho, Europe's first woman poet. Another lyric
poet from the island, Odysseus Elytis, won the Nobel Prize for
literature in 1979.
   The Dukakis family came from Pelopi, a cluster of stone houses
reached by a dirt road winding up Mytilene's highest mountain and
still considered one of the poorest villages on the island.
   Dukakis' grandfather moved away in the 1880s to make a better
life on the nearby coast of Turkey, where Greeks prospered as
store-owners and merchants.
   ``Mike's grandfather and mine were cousins who both left the
village of Pelopi and settled in Edremit on the Turkish side. His
grandfather ran a general store and mine ran a bakery,'' George
Grigoriou-Dukakis, 76, a retired agronomist, said in an interview.
   The Dukakis property at the top of the village was sold in 1933
and Yiannis Manolis, the villager who bought it, keeps the yellowed
sale contract in his pocket.
   ``I want to stay around long enough to welcome Michalis back
here as president,'' said Manolis, 81, who lives in a two-story
house he built on the ruins of the Dukakis home.
   There are no records surviving to clarify whether Dukakis'
father was born on Mytilene _ then ruled by Turkey _ or in Edremit.
   Dukakis' mother was born in the northern city of Larissa, then a
sleepy farm town but now a booming center for the Thessaly region.
   ``Cousin Euterpe is a tough lady who'd be called a feminist if
she were young now. ... Her family all left for the States in the
early 1900s after losing their land to the Turks,'' said Nikos
Milingos, a third cousin who runs a farm chemicals business.
   Like most of the relatives, the Milingos family first met
Dukakis when he came to Greece in 1976 during his first term as
governor. Now they visit Massachussetts regularly.
   ``We found him very warm and welcoming, but he's certainly a man
of principle,'' said Olympia Milingos. ``When we went for dinner at
their home in the days of energy-saving, Euterpe told us to take
sweaters because the heating would be low _ and it was.''
   The Greek-American community in the United States, numbering
between 1 million and 3 million by various estimates, is pouring in
funds to back its ``patrida'' (homeland) candidate.
   According to Dukakis aides, around 25 percent of his first $15
million in campaign funds came from Greek-Americans.
   Apart from the wish to claim a U.S. president of Greek descent,
many in Greece say that Dukakis' election would repair the damage
to their self-image caused by former Vice President Spiro Agnew.
   ``Spiro Agnew was an embarrassment to Greece and the migrant
tradition. It's a bad memory for us that we'd like to erase through
Dukakis,'' said former Culture Minister Dimitris Nianias, a member
of parliament for Mytilene.

   It is the evening of April 4, 1968. The
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. leans over a balcony railing at The
Lorraine Motel. The crack of a single shot from a high-powered
rifle shatters the air.
   Suddenly, he's gone.
   This much is clearly documented. But who killed the 39-year-old
civil rights leader and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize?
   James Earl Ray, the small-time thief who pleaded guilty, has
spent the past 20 years trying to prove he didn't do it. He talks
of a shadowy ``Raoul.''
   Other principals in the case hold widely varying opinions: Ray's
attorneys disagree on whether he was the triggerman; the prosecutor
acknowledges he wasn't confident about the case; the chairman of a
congressional committee that studied the assassination says he
still thinks Ray was part of a larger, unsolved conspiracy.
   The questions remain. What of the cigarette butts found in the
getaway car _ given that Ray did not smoke? What of the clothing in
two sizes in the car's trunk?
   The fatal shot came from a communal bathroom at the rear of a
flophouse across a narrow street from The Lorraine Motel. Ray
maintains he was not in that bathroom when the shot was fired.
   ``I was a few blocks away, trying to get a tire fixed on my
car,'' he said in a recent interview with The Associated Press at
Brushy Mountain State Prison, where he is serving a 99-year
sentence. ``When I started back to my room I saw a police roadblock
had been set up; it was about that time that I heard on my car
radio King had been shot and the police were looking for a man in a
white Mustang, the same kind of car I was driving, so I took off
for Atlanta.''
   Ray, who had checked into the rooming house the day King was
killed, said he was in Memphis to take part in an illicit
gun-running scheme. He said the scheme was concocted by a mystery
man named Raoul, an international smuggler whom Ray contends he met
several months earlier at a waterfront bar in Montreal.
   He also says Raoul, whom he describes as a blond man with a
Latin American accent, set him up to be framed for King's murder.
   ``The fact is I don't know who killed King,'' said Ray, who
recently turned 60. ``I only pleaded guilty because I was
desperate. I had been in isolation for eight months in the Memphis
jail, and Percy Foreman was pressuring me to cop a plea. He was
telling me my family would get in trouble and I'd get the death
penalty if I didn't do what he said.''
   Foreman, the Houston attorney who represented Ray when he
entered his guilty plea March 10, 1969, angrily disputes these
assertions.
   ``The s.o.b. got down on his knees and thanked me for saving his
life when I told him I had gotten the prosecutor to go along with a
guilty plea,'' Foreman said when contacted in Houston recently.
   Foreman, now in his mid-80s, says he thinks Ray was extremely
fortunate not to have stood trial. He also rejects Ray's story
about Raoul. ``I think he acted alone,'' he said.
   Asked what might have motivated Ray to commit such an act,
Foreman said, ``It was racism. His conversations simply steamed
with racist remarks.''
   Ray, who was a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary at
the time King was killed, denies he harbored any ill will toward
King and defies anyone to prove otherwise.
   ``King was just another politician to me,'' he said. ``Why would
I want to do something like kill a big-shot politician, me a
fugitive, and bring all that heat down on myself?''
   He admits buying the rifle, a Remington Gamemaster, 30.06
caliber, that authorities say was the murder weapon. But he says he
bought, at a Birmingham, Ala., gun shop, at Raoul's instruction and
with money provided by Raoul.
   ``I gave the rifle to Raoul,'' Ray said. ``If I had been buying
it to kill King, you can bet I wouldn't have bought it at a gun
shop. I would have gotten it from a fence, so it couldn't have been
traced.''
   Birmingham lawyer Arthur Hanes Sr. said he tends to believe that
story. He represented Ray for four months before Foreman.
   ``I've never believed Ray shot King,'' said Hanes, a former FBI
agent and one-time Birmingham mayor. ``I personally stood in that
flophouse bathroom and looked across to the motel balcony where the
Rev. King was standing when he was shot. It was a difficult angle.
Ray simply didn't have enough expertise with rifles to make a shot
like that, in my opinion.''
   Hanes also said he had never heard Ray utter a single racist
statement.
   ``I've given this case a lot of thought, and I've concluded
someone assisted Ray,'' he added, ``but I can't say who.''
   The case should have gone to trial, he said, ``to clear the air,
if nothing else. I tried to get the judge to try the case, but he
said there was too much pressure, from the government and the
Memphis business community, to accept a guilty plea and avoid the
publicity that a trial would generate.''
   The judge, W. Preston Battle, died a week after Ray's guilty
plea. However, the chief prosecutor, Philip Canale, acknowledged
last week that, contrary to Foreman's assertion, he had been happy
to get a plea from Ray.
   ``It would have been a big, time-consuming and expensive trial
with dozens and dozens of witnesses from all over the country,''
said Canale, now an assistant U.S. Attorney in Memphis. ``I have
never regretted the guilty plea because we got a substantial
sentence. Also, I didn't want to take a chance on getting a cranky
juror and having a mistrial.''

   Canale added that although he had no eyewitness and the evidence
against Ray was largely circumstantial, he doesn't buy the
conspiracy theory.
   ``I think he acted alone,'' he said, noting that the FBI had
found Ray's fingerprint on the rifle discarded by the gunman near
the scene of the crime.
   However, supporters of Ray's story say his fingerprint was on
the rifle because he had purchased it. They also note that, while
Ray is a lifelong non-smoker, Viceroy cigarette butts were found in
the rooming house bathroom and in his car ashtray, and that two
sizes of clothing were found in his trunk.
   Ray said the fact that Raoul often used his car may explain the
butts in the ashtray and clothes in the trunk. ``As for cigarettes
in the bathroom I can't say because I was never in that bathroom,''
he said. ``My prints were never found in there, you know.''
   Then there were the two white Mustangs. The late Guy Canipe,
whose amusement company was located next door to the flophouse,
told investigators he saw a fleeing man ditch a rifle and a small
overnight bag in front of his store and then drive away in a white
Mustang, one of two that had been parked in front of the store that
afternoon. He described the man as having dark hair and a beard.
   Ray, who was captured in London two months after King's death,
says the fact that the gunman ditched the rifle and his bag _ which
Ray says he had left in his room when he went to get the tire fixed
_ shows somebody was trying to frame him.
   ``Why would I have dumped my stuff there for the police to find
when all I had to do was put it in the car and drive away?'' he
asked.
   After two years of hearings, ending in 1978, the House Select
Committee on Assassinations couldn't answer that question. The
committee issued a report saying Ray probably had been part of a
larger conspiracy.
   But while the committee couldn't say who else had participated
in the plot, it did exonerate the CIA and FBI, both of which had
conducted extensive illegal surveillance and smear campaigns
against King throughout the 1960s. Former FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover was known to have hated King.
   FBI agents testified that no evidence could be found of
conspiracies involving the Mafia, Ku Klux Klan or foreign
communists.
   Some of King's friends, however, still feel that letting
Hoover's FBI investigate King's assassination was like letting a
hungry fox guard a henhouse.
   ``I have no proof but I feel in my heart that the government,
probably the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover, and perhaps the CIA, were
involved,'' says the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, who was with King
when he died in a Memphis hospital an hour after the shooting.
   ``It's just a pity but, given the way things were back then,
we'll probably never know the whole truth about one of the greatest
tragedies of our time.''

   James Earl Ray has spent most of his ``free
time'' at Brushy Mountain State Prison plotting ways to get out,
either by going over the wall or into a courtroom.
   So far, he's been more successful at breaking out. In 1977,
inmate No. 65477 managed to scale the wall and remain free for
three days before being apprehended in the rugged hills near the
prison.
   A couple of years earlier, he escaped from his cell through an
air vent only to be captured inside the prison walls a few hours
later.
   But the 60-year-old Alton, Ill., native hasn't been able to get
back into court since March 10, 1969, the day he pleaded guilty to
killing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   And although he is doggedly determined to win a day in court,
Ray apparently has become more resigned to prison life than he was
in his escape-artist days, which included a 1967 breakout from the
Missouri State Penitentiary, where he was serving 20 years for
armed robbery.
   ``He's a good inmate,'' said James Worthington, an officer at
Brushy Mountain, a maximum security prison 40 miles west of
Knoxville. ``He does good time and doesn't cause us any trouble _
not of late, anyway.''
   Ray works in the prison laundry, earning $1 a day. He shares an
11-by-8-foot cell with another inmate and spends most of his
weekends in the prison law library.
   ``I work five days a week, from 7 a.m. to 3 o'clock in the
afternoon,'' he said in a recent interview with The Associated
Press. ``We get an hour a day for exercise in the yard through the
week and two hours on Saturdays and Sundays.''
   He maintained, as he has ever since pleading guilty, that he
didn't kill King and doesn't know who did. He said he pleaded
guilty only because he was pressured into it.
   Ray speaks in a quiet but determined voice when discussing his
legal problems. Although he has spent nearly half of his life
behind bars he still looks fit: his hair is dark, with white
sideburns, his dark blue eyes are alert and his body is trim in a
blue denim uniform.
   ``It's always a good idea to keep fit in prison,'' he said,
rubbing a scar on his left cheek, the result of an attack by three
black inmates in 1980. Two of his attackers got 60-year sentences
for attempted murder, and the third was given 20 years.
   ``I got careless for a moment,'' he said, recalling the assault.
``Like a fool I went into the law library when there were no guards
present. But, then I was lucky, too; they stabbed me in the arm,

   Worthington describes Ray as a quiet loner who usually keeps to
himself when he goes out to the prison yard for exercise with other
prisoners.
   Although married in 1983 to a Nashville artist who was teaching
art appreciation to inmates, Ray hasn't had a visitor since last
fall. To pass the time, he reads and paints _ mostly watercolor
landscapes from memory.
   He recently helped prepare a second edition of his
autobiography, which he said he wrote to tell his side of the story
about the King assassination.
   As for his 99-year sentence, he said, ``I really don't think I
should have had to spend all this time in prison. I didn't kill
anybody.''

   A day of reckoning for the rival suitors of
Federated Department Stores Inc. passed without ushering one of
them _ Campeau Corp. or R.H. Macy & Co. _ to the altar, but it
appeared Macy raised the stakes in the $6 billion takeover battle.
   Federated's board of directors was expected to choose between
the companies' final bids Wednesday, but deliberations dragged on
all day and into the night with no sign of an end to the
2-month-old contest.
   Federated spokesman Jim Sluzewski said late Wednesday evening he
did not know when a decision would be announced.

   American Stores Co. stock soared amid market
rumors that Lucky Stores Inc. might be planning a ``Pac-Man''
takeover bid to counter its supermarket rival's acquisition offer.
   American Stores has launched a $45-a-share tender offer for
Lucky, which would produce a deal worth about $1.74 billion.
American later said it would boost the offer to $50 a share, or
$1.93 billion, if Lucky's management supported the acquistion.
   Lucky declined to comment Wednesday, but analysts said Lucky
might be considering making its own bid for American Stores. In New
York Stock Exchange trading, American Stores jumped $2.75 a share
to $59.75, while Lucky fell $1.50 a share to $48.37{.

   The second consecutive monthly decline in
orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods is no cause for
alarm, analysts say.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for durable
and non-durable goods dropped 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$210.86 billion last month following a 0.6 percent decline in
January.
   Economists said while businesses cut back on orders in the early
part of the year, the cutbacks were moderate and may set the stage
for faster growth.

   The 42-page study released Wednesday said the five Japanese
companies are illegally selling compact pickup trucks for 10

their Japanese home market.
   One of the companies accused, Toyota Motor Corp., immediately

   The Internal Revenue Service says it will
waive penalties for underpayments of estimated tax on most types of
retirement income for 1987.
   The agency earlier had decided not to impose such penalties on
wages earned in 1987, because of widespread confusion about the new
tax law and a complex W-4 withholding form.
   In another decision affecting retirees, the IRS said Wednesday
that owners of multiple Individual Retirement Accounts who passed
the age of 70{ in 1987 will be allowed more discretion in choosing
from which account to take a distribution. Such owners are required

   A positive new report on U.S. stocks of refined
oil products has helped lift oil prices out of a temporary slump.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May delivery
of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, settled
Wednesday at $17.08 per 42-gallon barrel, up 10 cents from
Tuesday's close.
   Among refined products, the April contract for wholesale heating
oil jumped 0.45 cent a gallon to 48.60 cents. Unleaded gasoline for
April rose by 0.39 cent a gallon to 48.65 cents.
   Trading on the exchange was described as light, muted by the
approach of the Easter holiday weekend.
   The advance came on the heels of a modest decline on Tuesday _
which had broken a four-day rally as many investors sold futures
contracts and took profits.
   The recent strength stems from hopes that the pricing committee
of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
achieve an agreement to prop up prices, analysts say. The pricing
panel is due to meet in Vienna, Austria, starting April 9.
   Prices have risen in nine of the last 12 trading sessions on the
Mercantile Exchange.
   Traders said prices got an additional boost in Wednesday's
session from the latest weekly report on U.S. oil stocks compiled
by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group based in
Washington.
   The API statistics, released after the market closed on Tuesday,
showed substantial drawdowns in stocks of both gasoline and heating
oil in the week ended March 25 compared with the previous week.
   The decrease in product inventories was seen as indicating a
continued robust demand, analysts said.
   ``We had a fairly rational reaction here'' to the API figures,
said Bob Baker, an oil futures analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.

<HEAD>Factory Orders For Manufactured Goods Declines</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Economists shrugged off an 0.8 percent decline in orders to U.S.
factories for manufactured goods during February, even though it
represented the second consecutive monthly decline.
   The financial markets put in a mixed performance Wednesday. On
Wall Street, the stock market faltered but the dollar showed signs
of steadying in foreign exchange, where the British pound stole
center stage. Bond prices were little changed.
   Orders for durable and non-durable goods dropped to a seasonally
adjusted $210.86 billion last month following a 0.6 percent decline
in January, the Commerce Department said.
   The February setback was the biggest since a 1.4 percent drop
last August and marked the first time that factory orders have
fallen for two consecutive months since the summer of 1986.
   Economists said the declines indicated that businesses cut back
on orders in the early part of the year to help trim high levels of
unsold goods that had built up in the final quarter of 1987.
   While this process will dampen growth, economists said it
appeared that the cutbacks had been moderate and would set the
stage for faster growth in the months ahead.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more
than 10 points in the early going, closed with a 20.22-point loss
at 1,978.12.
   Investors were reluctant to take large positions ahead of the
upcoming three-day Easter weekend.
   The dollar showed signs of steadying after a wave of tumbles,
but it was the pound that posted far greater gains, rising in New
York to $1.8780 from $1.86425.
   In the past seven years, the pound has hit a low of $1.0470, in
February 1985, and a high of $2.4525 in November 1980.
   In jumping to its highest levels in two years, the British
currency has been boosted by a strong economy, Britain's relatively
high interest rates and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
unrelenting grip on inflation.
   Bond prices eased slightly. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year
issue fell 7-32 point, or about $2.50 per $1,000 in face value, to
yield 8.77 percent.
   Oil prices rebounded from a temporary setback. On the New York
Mercantile Exchange, contracts for May delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, settled at $17.08 per
42-gallon barrel, up 10 cents from Tuesday's close.

<HEAD>Japan Most Creditworthy Again; Switzerland New No. 2</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-World Credit-List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland has displaced West Germany as the
world's second most creditworthy nation behind Japan, a new survey
of international bankers reveals.
   The United States _ for many years the bankers' No. 1 darling _
remains stuck in fourth place. And in general the world's bankers
seem to be taking a gloomier view of the world debt situation.
   In a survey of 112 nations, Institutional Investor, an American
financial magazine, finds that the average country's credit rating
in March has dropped considerably from a similar survey last
September.
   Every six months the New York-based monthly asks about 100
international banks to rate the creditworthiness of more than 100
nations on a scale of 0 to 100. In the magazine's March survey
Japan ranks first with a score of 94.6, and North Korea 112th with
4.0.
   The global average rating was 38.9, down 0.4 points from last
September, and down 1.1 points from March 1987. Institutional
Investor notes that this is the fourth consecutive drop from the
peak of 40.6 attained in March 1986.
   Countries with higher credit ratings generally find it easier to
borrow from international commercial banks and are likely to obtain
more favorable credit terms.
   ``The most stable region in recent surveys has been Western
Europe,'' the magazine says, ``but this time it registered the
biggest gain of any region, rising 0.6 points to 73.9.''
   One banker noted that a rising German mark may cause export
difficulties for West Germany and it faces greater unemployment
difficulties than Switzerland.
   Portugal's rating rose 2.2 points, thanks largely to ``an
austerity program... European Community entry, and...full-fledged
transition to democracy.''
   Despite Japan's pre-eminence, the Asia-Pacific region,
comprising 19 countries ``led the decliners with a sizable 1.4
point fall'' in the average country rating.
   Australia fell 2.2 points, the second-largest drop in the
survey, due mainly to ``continued balance of payments deficits...
and the fact that its borrowing has now reached a very high
percentage of gross national product.''
   The Middle East, comprising 14 nations, was up an average 0.4
points ``largely because no news is good news for the region.
   ``The biggest gainer was Cyprus, up 1.9 points, because of...
consistent improvement in the current account.''
   In Eastern Europe ``the big gainer was Rumania, up 2.2 points
because of increased banker confidence that it would maintain its
repayment schedule.''
   ``Africa had more gainers than losers _ 14 nations to 11 _ yet
its overall rating fell 0.3 points.''
   ``The Congo fell 2.0 points, the third-biggest drop in the
survey,'' probably due in large part to a lack of financial
information on the country.
   In North America the United States dropped 1.5 points, due
mainly to the budget and foreign trade deficits and the decline of
the dollar.
   In Latin America ``Brazil fell 2.3 points, the biggest decline
in the survey'' because of political uncertainties and the lack of
a coherent economic policy in the Third World's biggest debtor
nation.

<TEXT>
   Lucky Stores Inc. may turn the tables on rival
grocer American Stores Co. to thwart the pursuer's $1.74 billion
buyout offer, analysts say.
   Talk of the rarely used ``Pac-Man defense'' pushed American
Stores stock up $2.75 to $59.75 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange Wednesday, while Lucky lost $1.50 a share to close at
$48.37{.
   Earlier this week American Stores launched a $45-a-share tender
offer for Lucky. But the Salt Lake City-based supermarket giant
later said it was prepared to boost the offer to $50 a share, or
$1.93 billion, if Lucky's management supported the acquisition.
   Lucky has declined to comment on the offers, but analysts said
rumors focused on whether Lucky might be considering making its own
bid for American Stores.
   A combination of the two companies would rival Kroger Co. as the
nation's largest supermarket operation.
   Lucky Stores spokeswoman Lissa Perlman said the company
``doesn't comment on rumors.'' The only comment Lucky has made is
that its board is studying American Stores' two proposals.
   ``There has been conjecture all along about what options Lucky
might have,'' said Jonathan Ziegler, an analyst with the investment
firm Sutro & Co. in San Francisco.
   Ziegler noted that Lucky, which operates in the lucrative
California market, would have to take on a huge amount of debt to
acquire American Stores.
   Analysts specualted Lucky might be trying to put American Stores
stock ``in play'' on Wall Street to take the spotlight off itself.
   The rumors came a day after American Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs
complained of ``various reports'' that Lucky might be considering a
``defensive acquisition'' of another company to make itself
financial unattractive.
   In a letter Tuesday to Lucky's board of directors, Skaggs
cautioned against a maneuver that could interfere with his
company's takeover plans and warned that any attempt to ``frustrate
the choice given to your shareholders through a defensive
acquisition'' would affect American's willingness to increase its
tender offer to $50 a share.
   Skaggs reiterated that American Stores would consider divesting
stores if it acquired Lucky, in order to mitigate any antitrust
concerns that might exist.
   American Stores is the nation's third largest grocery retailer
with 1,700 stores and annual sales of $15 billion. Lucky is the
sixth largest with 480 stores and sales of $7 billion.
   American Stores filed a lawsuit last week in Delaware charging
Lucky and its executives with breaching their fiduciary duties by
``following a course of conduct directed toward entrenching
themselves in control of Lucky Stores.''
   As part of defensive measures taken over a year ago to stave off
corporate raider Asher Edelman, Lucky voted senior management
lucrative ``golden parachute'' contracts and announced a
restructuring plan that included changing the company's state of
incorporation from California to Delaware and a buy-back of 27
percent of its outstanding shares.
   The company has noted that its bylaws also contain an
anti-takeover provision limiting the voting power of any
shareholder who acquires more than 10 percent of Lucky's stock.

between third-party data bases and their own PC software tools.''
   ``It fits in their long-term strategy,'' said John Maxwell III
of Dillon Read & Co. Inc. in New York. ``It's a positive step for
the future.''
   Analysts say Blueprint is part of Lotus' strategy to expand
applications for its software in a period of increased competition
from spreadsheet manufacturers, such as Borland International Corp.
of Scotts Valley, Calif.
   Lotus stock rebounded slightly following Wednesday's
announcement.
   The stock had tumbled nearly $7 a share since last week after
the Cambridge-based firm announced plans to delay release of the
Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 spreadsheet software until the fourth
quarter. The delay caused analysts to cut 1988 per-share earnings
estimates from about $1.95 to about $1.50.
   Lotus stock closed up 50 cents a share to $22.50 in
over-the-counter trading Wednesday.
   The Blueprint kit, scheduled to be released late this year, will
aid data base manufacturers in creating drives that will greatly
streamline the process of accessing software not specially designed
for Lotus systems, said Lotus spokeswoman Betsy Kosheff.
   The drives will be sold to consumers by data base firms
including Oracle Corp. of Belmont, Calif., which has formally
announced plans to place a Blueprint drive in its upcoming product
line. Other firms expressing interest in Blueprint include Microrim
Inc., PC Publishing Inc. and Synex Systems Corp., according to the
Lotus statement.
   Kosheff said the drive will allow Lotus system users to hit one
key to connect with various data bases, rather than the many steps
now required. Data obtained through Blueprint drives will be
compatible with existing and planned Lotus software, including
spreadsheets and graphics, she said.
   Lotus spokesman Philip Greenough said Blueprint is an
enhancement of Application Connection, a Lotus-created data base
connection drive introduced in 1986.
   The Blueprint drives will be available for use on all sizes of
Lotus computer systems, said Greenough.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against all major currencies in
early European trading today. Gold prices rose.
   In London, the British pound, spurred by market expectations
that Britain's Conservative government would not move to hold it
down, rose to $1.8798, up from $1.8790 late Wednesday.
   Dealers anticipated quiet trading ahead of a four-day Easter
holiday weekend.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar dropped against the Japanese yen to close at the
day's low of 124.50 yen, down 0.93 yen from Wednesday. Later, in
London, the dollar fell further and was quoted at 124.28 yen.
   ``Profit-taking dollar selling brought the dollar down, but
besides that there was no notable movement in the market,'' said
Ken Iiya of the Bank of Tokyo.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6584 West German marks, down from
1.6625; 1.3677 Swiss francs, down from 1.3732; 5.6265 French
francs, down from 5.6505; 1.8632 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8725;
1,230.25 Italian lire, down from 1,235.50; 1.2355 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2370.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $457.30 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $453.60. At mid-morning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $458.00.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $458, up from $454.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.02 to close at a bid $458.81.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.76 a troy
ounce, up from late Wednesday's $6.65.

   The dollar dropped sharply against the yen today
while stock prices fell slightly after three days of substantial
gains.
   After opening lower at 125.15 yen, the dollar dropped further
and closed at 124.50 yen, the day's low, down 0.93 yen from
Wednesday's close of 125.43 yen.
   The Bank of Japan appeared to step into the market to support
the dollar late in the morning and at the outset of the afternoon
session, traders said.
   ``Profit-taking dollar selling brought the dollar down, but
besides that there was no notable movement in the market,'' said
Ken Iiya of the Bank of Tokyo. The market still is anticipating a
weaker dollar, he said.
   Another trader said market participants were hesitant about
trading while awaiting the scheduled release of U.S. economic data
on Friday. In addition, he said, New York markets will close for a
holiday Friday and will not provide any lead for Tokyo after the
data is released.
   Figures to be released Friday include U.S. unemployment in March
and construction expenditures in February.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which rose 366.89 points Wednesday to a post-crash
high, sliped 59.81 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 26,260.26
points.
   ``The market has come to a rest as investors stepped to the
sidelines, following the three days of sharp gains,'' said Yoshio
Shimoyama of Nikko Securities. The Nikkei average gained more than
1,000 points in the three days.
   The dollar's fall did not affect the market, which kept a
positive mood about prospects for the new fiscal year beginning
Friday, he said.
   Investors also were cautious while awaiting the U.S. economic
data, traders said. The volume of the first section was estimated
at 1.4 billion shares, down from 1.8 billion shares Wednesday.

   Prices fell on the London Stock Exchange today,
depressed by the continuing strength of the British currency and by
previous declines in New York and Tokyo.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was off 12.3
points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,744.6 at midday.
   Volume was a low 175 million shares, down from 232 million
shares a day earlier.
   Volume was light on the last day before the extended Easter
holiday weekend. The London market is closed on Friday and Monday.
   The market remained in negative territory all morning, moving in
a narrow range after an early markdown, dealers said.
   The early markdown was caused by the previous drop in New York
and Tokyo and by sterling's recent rise against the Deutsche mark.
   Sterling was boosted by comments on Wednesday by Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who emphasized the government's
commitment to fight inflation.
   Currency dealers interpreted Lawson's statements as evidence the
government will tolerate further rises in sterling without cutting
interest rates again.
   Sterling's rise depressed the major exporting companies' stocks
that get a competitive advantage from a weak pound.

   Mythology failed to record who supplied the wax
and feathers for Daedalus' wings 3,500 years ago. That omission is
not being repeated in 1988.
   Thanks to the miracle of modern public relations, corporate
backers are getting a share of the acclaim in the current attempt
to recreate the mythical flight of Daedalus from the Greek island
of Crete.
   A high-tech human-powered aircraft made a successful series of
test flights today in Iraklion, Crete, in preparation for a
world-record distance attempt that also will recreate the ancient
Daedalus myth.
   The 68-pound ultralight Daedalus 88 completed six flights
lasting less than three minutes each in calm dawn weather above a
Greek air force base adjoining Iraklion airport.
   Five athlete pilots took turns to pedal the shimmering
pink-and-silver plane at speeds of around 14 mph, flying about 15
feet above the tarmac.
   News releases, an innovation unknown in ancient Greece, have let
it be known to the world that Arrow Gear Co. of Downers Grove,
Ill., supplied gearboxes for the Daedalus aircraft.
   Poly-Flex Inc. of Walworth, Wis., donated plastic wheels.
Polar-Electro KY of Kempele, Finland, contributed heart rate
monitors. Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. sponsored the prototype Light
Eagle aircraft.
   The design and construction of the Daedalus is mainly the work
of students, faculty, staff and recent alumni of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   John S. Langford, the program manager, is on leave from the
Institute for Defense Analyses in Alexandria, Va.
   The attraction of the Daedalus Project for a corporate sponsor
is obvious. It brings together high technology, teamwork,
imagination and daring.
   ``It's been a super project. It's a natural fit for us,'' said
Clare Hertel, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Shaklee Corp.
   Shaklee sponsors the Daedalus crew and United Technologies Corp.
is the financial sponsor of the aircraft itself. The two companies
are treating the project as part of their research-and-development
efforts.
   Shaklee says the energy drink it is developing for the Daedalus
pilots might lead to a beverage for endurance athletes that could
be sold commercially.
   In cooperation with Yale University's Ethan Nadel, Shaklee has
developed a drink containing easily digestible carbohydrates for
quick energy.
   ``If they (pilots) run out of energy or feel fatigued, no matter
how wonderful the plane is, the engine might run out,'' said James
Whittam, Shaklee's vice president for science and technology.
   Whittam said Shaklee has recently improved the flavor of its
experimental beverage, but won't describe the flavor.
   ``It won't be a fruit punch, I can tell you that,'' Whittam
said. ``It's our secret weapon.''
   Shaklee, a company with an eye for the dramatic, has also
sponsored the U.S. Ski Team, the around-the-world flight of the
Voyager and Ned Gillette's rowboat trip from South America to
Antarctica.
   The engine of the Daedalus is a human being, so the jet engine
builders at United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney don't have much to
learn from it. But the air conditioner makers at Carrier could gain
insights into how to keep air flowing smoothly over slowly turning
blades, said Russell Meyerand Jr., chief scientist of the Hartford,
Conn.-based company.
   Better understanding of air flows could also help in
streamlining the exterior frame of Otis elevators. It could even
help the company develop concepts for a solar-powered aircraft that
would hover at 100,000 feet and serve as a communications relay
station for communications, Meyerand said.
   The high-altitude aircraft would presumably have military uses.
Meyerand said it would be developed only if it received government
support.
   United Technologies says it has contributed $430,000 to the
Daedalus Project, plus engineering and materials support. Shaklee
says it has contributed about $225,000, including food for the
athletes and research at Yale University on the high-energy drink.
   United Technologies sees its participation in part as a way of
recruiting engineers from colleges such as MIT and inspiring a new
generation of students.
   ``I hope that young men and women ... might be encouraged,''
Meyerand said. ``Rather than becoming a lawyer _ there are too many
of them anyway _ they might go to engineering school.''

<HEAD>Audi: Shift-Lock Has Worked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Audi of America Inc. is lashing out at critics of
the shift lock on its 5000S models with automatic transmission,
which it says has prevented sudden acceleration.
   ``They have refused to accept, and to Audi's dismay, continue to
refuse to accept, the truth about unintended acceleration,'' the
importer said. The shift lock ``has been recognized worldwide as
the best device available to prevent unintended acceleration,''
Audi said Wednesday.
   The automaker made its comments as part of a report in which it
said it had received nearly 400 complaints about the shift lock.
   The lock prevents drivers from shifting out of park unless a
foot is on the brake pedal. A car's engine cannot overcome its
brake, nor can a defect in the engine or transmission affect the
brake system because the systems are not connected.
   Following studies of reports of unintended acceleration in the
Audi car and in vehicles by many other automakers including General
Motors Corp. and Mercedes-Benz, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration labeled it an industry-wide phenomenon apparently
caused by driver error.
   The shift lock prevents drivers from making the error _ hitting
the gas pedal instead of the brake. Most Japanese automakers are
planning to install them as standard equipment.
   Audi said critics' attempts to discredit the shift lock serve as
attempts to prevent drivers from increasing their awareness of
which pedal they are stepping on.
   In a report to the NHTSA, Audi submitted an analysis of the
device's performance and information on 396 consumer complaints
received on models with shift locks.
   Audi installed shift locks on 1978-1986 models during a recall
that began in September 1986 and remains in effect. It included
them as standard equipment on 1987 and 1988 models.
   Of the 396 compaints, Audi said, all but 22 did not fit the
pattern of unintended acceleration. Of the 22, 15 involved
improperly installed shift locks. In the other seven cases, drivers
shifted into gear from neutral instead of park.
   The device has no effect when the car is in neutral. In all 22
cases, tests found the brakes functioned properly, Audi said.
   Audi said it has received no complaints of sudden acceleration
in 1988 models. It received 16 complaints on 1987 models, but none
proved to be cases of sudden acceleration, Audi said.
   Audi said it has installed shift locks on more than 170,000
cars, including 93 percent of its 1984-1986 fleet and 38 percent of
its 1978-1983 fleet.
   ``Both Audi and the federal agency continue to urge all owners
of cars which have not yet responded to make dealer appointments as
quickly as possible,'' the company said.
   ``The automatic shift lock is an effective cure,'' Audi said in
the conclusion of its report to NHTSA. ``Accident records and
insurance statistics demonstrate that the Audi 5000 is among the
safest cars in the United States.''

   The stock market showed no clear trend today in
an atmosphere of caution heading into the long Easter-Passover
weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.48 to
1,980.60 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the early
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 308 up, 632
down and 471 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.95 million shares as of 10

   Analysts said traders were reluctant to carry big positions
through the weekend, especially with a Labor Department report
coming Friday on the employment situation for March.
   Both the stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday, and
thus will not have a chance to respond to any surprises in the
employment data until Monday.
   In the last set of figures, a much stronger-than-expected
increase in nonfarm payroll employment dealt the bond market a
sharp setback.
   Brokers said money managers at investing institutions had pretty
much completed maneuvers to ready their portfolios for reports to
clients on their performance in the first quarter, which ends with
today's trading.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express rose ] to
24[; International Business Machines [ to 105\, and American
Telephone & Telegraph \ to 26}. But General Electric was unchanged
at 40\ and Ford Motor slipped [ to 43{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.02 to 146.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .34 at 293.33.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a
20.22-point loss at 1,978.12.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 568 up, 918 down and 468 unchanged. Big Board volume
totaled 151.81 million shares, against 152.69 million in the

   Contel Corp. will pay a former president $275,000
a year for life in return for his agreement last year to resign,
the company said this week.
   John Lemasters, 53, will also receive stock and medical benefits
from Atlanta-based Contel, the former Continental Telephone Co.,
the company said in its proxy statement mailed to shareholders.
   A Contel spokesman said the benefits would continue for the rest
of Lemasters' life.
   Lemasters resigned as head of the $3 billion company April 30,
1987, following the failure of a proposed merger he had spearheaded
with Communications Satellite Corp. of Washington, D.C. He headed
Contel for two years.
   Contel officials acknowledged Wednesday they had received
telephone calls from some shareholders criticizing the termination
agreement, reached last year.
   A Contel spokesman said the agreement was a compromise to
persuade Lemasters to give up his original contract, which included
a $380,000 base salary in 1986 and a special stock bonus worth more
than $800,000 over four years. Lemasters also agreed not to work
for a competitor.
   Lemasters, now president of a Pompano Beach, Fla., computer
firm, is to provide consulting and other services to Contel until
Aug. 3, 1988.

<HEAD>RepublicBank Expects Big First-Quarter Loss, May Default on Debts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ailing First RepublicBank Corp., a major bank
holding company that recently received a $1 billion federal
bailout, said it expects a significant first-quarter loss.
   The Dallas-based company also reported Wednesday in documents
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it may
default on about $33 million in long-term debts, a move which could
prompt creditors to demand immediate repayment.
   ``These factors, among others, indicate that the corporation may
be unable to continue in its present form,'' First RepublicBank
said in a draft of its annual report to shareholders filed with the
SEC. Shareholders have not yet received the report.
   Meanwhile, two class action suits have been filed by investors
against the company and seven of its top executives in federal
district court in Dallas.
   First RepublicBank, Texas' largest bank holding company and the
13th-largest in the nation, said it expects a ``significant loss''
during the first quarter of 1988. Company insiders expect the loss
to exceed $500 million.
   The loss was caused by major deposit outflows, increases in
funding costs and in problem loans, especially in real estate.
   The company received a $1 billion bailout from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. on March 17.
   In giving the aid, the FDIC said no protection was offered for
First RepublicBank's creditors and shareholders. At the same time,
the company suspended dividend payments to holders of preferred
shares.
   The two class action suits accuse First RepublicBank of
misleading investors about the company's financial health.
   The investors allege misrepresentation and fraud in the sale of
securities issued before RepublicBank Corp. acquired InterFirst
Corp. last June.
   In the first suit, New York investor Martin Theodores claims
that he and other investors saw the value of their First
RepublicBank securities plummet after the company's bailout
request. He claims that investors weren't adequately informed about
First RepublicBank's condition and the possibility that the company
would seek federal assistance.
   First RepublicBank spokesman Joe Bowles declined comment on the
litigation.
   In documents filed with the SEC, First RepublicBank said it may
default on about $33 million in long-term debt during the first
half of the year.
   If that happens and creditors demand immediate repayment, the
company said, ``the holders of as much as approximately half of the
consolidated long-term debt of First Republic may have the right to
accelerate the due date of their debt.''

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed
today in very light activity on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Little price movement was expected with many traders taking to
the sidelines ahead of two eagerly awaited Agriculture Department
reports due out after the close, analysts said.
   The annual report on spring planting intentions will give the
market a broad indication of the potential size of this year's corn
and soybean crops.
   The quarterly grain stocks report will reveal the levels of
grain on hand as of March 1.
   Together, the reports will indicate whether futures prices
should go higher to encourage more planting to meet the expected
demand, or lower to discourage plantings.
   ``People are afraid to take any position going into these
reports whether the news is positive, negative or neutral,'' said
Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It's been
a good four or five years since we've had that kind of situation.''
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.02} a bushel; corn was \ cent to
{ cent lower with May at $2.09\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1
cent lower with May at $1.60 a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower
to 1\ cents higher with May at $6.48{ a bushel.
   Most cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mostly
lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

   It's been slipped into everything from frying
pans to space suits to the nation's political vernacular, and now
Teflon, still the slickest solid on Earth, is sliding into its
second half-century.
   Discovered accidentally April 6, 1938, by a young chemist named
Roy J. Plunkett, the waxy white plastic turns 50 this week, still
dominating dozens of scientific and consumer uses with no hint of a
higher-tech replacement.
   It keeps the eggs from sticking to frying pans, for sure. But it
also coats electrical wires, chemical tanks, jogging suits and
lightbulbs. It's used to patch human hearts. It keeps the Statue of
Liberty from rusting.
   ``The applications, as far as I can tell, are no smaller than
our imaginations,'' says Plunkett, now a septuagenarian retiree
from the Du Pont chemical company. ``I'm amazed at the impact. And
there's more to go.''
   The reason for Teflon's endurance is simple: Nothing else is so
slippery, so tough and such a good insulator, all at the same time.
Even after five decades, ``It is unique in these qualities,'' says
professor Fred McGarry, a specialist in such materials at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   It's a discovery that almost slipped away. Plunkett, two years
out of college, was working with refrigeration gases in a Du Pont
lab in Deepwater, N.J., when an assistant pulled a cylinder of
Freon out of a dry ice storage bin, turned it on _ and nothing came
out.
   Someone else might have assumed the cylinder had leaked and
tossed it away. Plunkett didn't. He weighed the cylinder. He shook
it. He cut it open.
   ``A white solid material was obtained, which was supposed to be
a polymerized product'' of the Freon compound, Plunkett recorded
laconically in his lab notebook entry of 4-6-38.
   Voila.
   ``People describe it as a lucky chance, a bit of serendipity or
a flash of brilliance,'' says Plunkett, an inductee into the
National Inventors Hall of Fame. ``I like to think of it as a
combination of all three.''
   The serendipity, he notes, extended beyond the discovery itself.
It soon was found that the chance chemical reaction that produced
Teflon can have unhappy consequences. ``If there was any luck
involved in the discovery,'' says Plunkett, ``probably part of it
was that we didn't get blown up.''
   Du Pont testers gradually established Teflon's extraordinary
properties. It is ``damn near inert,'' says McGarry; it won't react
with chemicals or break down in the environment. It withstands
temperatures from 400 degrees below zero to 500 degrees above.
Energy passes through it without heating it up. It holds together
in a vacuum, meaning it's perfect for use in outer space.
   Lawrence English, editor of Materials Engineering magazine,
likens the impact of Teflon to that of the transistor. ``There's
nothing quite like it,'' he says. ``It's pervasive in technical
environments _ all over the place, in a lot of really curious and
diverse applications.''
   At the beginning, it was under wraps, restricted to government
defense work from 1941, when Du Pont first was able to produce it,
until 1948. It was used in the Manhattan Project for gaskets and
vessel linings to contain a highly corrosive chemical needed in the
production of the atom bomb.
   It also coated wires in electronic devices, making them
considerably fire resistant. Today, the greatest commercial use of
Teflon is in wire coating, followed by gaskets and shaft seals and
pipe and tank coatings.
   Teflon didn't reach the public eye until May 1956, when a store
in Nice, France, put the fist Teflon-lined pan on its shelves. The
idea stuck, and an estimated 500 million pots and pans coated with
Teflon have been sold since.
   It wasn't until 20 years later that Teflon moved from kitchen to
clothes closet. Robert Gore, who was in the wire coating business,
found that a piece of stretched Teflon has pores big enough to let
water vapor out but too small to let water droplets in. He stuck it
to fabric and called it Gore-Tex, the first waterproof-breathable
clothing.
   Teflon's next frontier was the language. That breakthrough came
the morning of Aug. 2, 1983, as Pat Schroeder was cooking eggs for
the kids. Schroeder happens to be a Democratic congresswoman, and
as she slid the eggs out of a frying pan, she reflected on the way
political accountability, in her view, slid off President Reagan.
   ``I said, `He's just like this pan,'' she recalled last week.
``Nothing sticks.''
   Members of Congress may start the day's session with one-minute
speeches, and this is how Schroeder started hers that day: ``Mr.
Speaker, after carefully watching Ronald Reagan, he is attempting a
great breakthrough in political technology _ he has been perfecting
the Teflon-coated presidency.''
   The phrase, picked up by the papers, caught on within weeks.
``Americans love shorthand descriptions of things,'' reflects
Schroeder. ``The only problem was that it didn't work. Still
nothing stuck to him.''
   Political efficacy aside, one outfit that didn't appreciate the
publicity was Du Pont, which holds the Teflon trademark even though
the patent on the formula has long expired.
   ``They were most unhappy. A guy came by my office from their
corporate headquarters and kind of snarled and growled about it,''
even threatening a copyright infringement lawsuit if she kept using
the phrase, Schroeder says. ``I could hardly keep a straight face.''
   But when it comes to Teflon, there hasn't been much else for Du
Pont to snarl or growl about _ a spokeswoman says the company has
sold 2.4 billion pounds of Teflon. The current price is about $5.50
a pound.
   As for Plunkett, his work with Teflon ended almost as soon as it
was begun. After three months, he was transferred to another Du
Pont lab. He spent his career working with Freon, not Teflon.
   Plunkett did not get a direct share of Teflon profits. Du Pont
doesn't work that way. But the company has two bonus pay systems,
one for outstanding work and another for a contribution beyond the
call of duty.
   Says Plunkett: ``I got 'em both.''

<HEAD>MCI Looking for Positive Cash Flow by Early 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. expects that by early
1989 the company will achieve a positive cash flow for the first
time in its 20-year history, a company spokesman confirmed Thursday.
   Once that goal is achieved, MCI plans to reduce its debt and
later begin buying back the 16 percent stake in the company held by
International Business Machines Corp., said spokesman Bernard
Goodrich.
   The company, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier,
wants to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio from 67 percent to around
40 percent over the next four years, Goodrich said.
   ``At that point, we would look at the market and see if the next
step is to buy back the IBM stock,'' he said. ``We're talking three
to four years before we would consider that and then we'd have to
consider market conditions.''
   Goodrich confirmed a report in Thursday's editions of The Wall
Street Journal, in which MCI officials outlined the company's
future plans.
   Financial pressures on the company have eased now that it has
finished building its digital network. It also has added 800
service, operator services and direct-dial service virtually
worldwide to match the offerings of industry leader American
Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   MCI acquired IBM's share of Satellite Business Systems in 1986
in exchange for 47 million shares of MCI stock. Under the
agreement, IBM cannot acquire more than 30 percent of MCI's stock
without the company's approval.
   With a stock repurchase, MCI could assure its independence and
increase its earnings per share, Goodrich said.
   MCI ended 1987 with earnings of $88 million, or 31 cents per
share, on revenues of $3.94 billion. The company's capital and
other expenses exceeded its cash flow by $200 million last year.
   IBM had no comment on MCI's stock-repurchase plans.
   A company achieves positive cash flow when its net profit plus
depreciation is greater than its expenditures on dividends and
investment in plant and equipment. MCI does not pay dividends.

<HEAD>Income Taxes Fair? Consider This</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the benefits proclaimed for the Tax Reform
Act of 1986 were simplicity and fairness, but with each tax return
filed this year those claims become more questionable.
   Simplicity obviously hasn't been achieved. And fairness? While a
quality such as this involves less obvious and more subjective
judgments, there is evidence to suggest it is absent from many
chapters of the 1986 law.
   Consider this: An investor in mutual funds could be forced to
pay taxes on profits never realized _ in fact, pay taxes on money
lost.
   Mutual funds, remember, are viewed as the sanctuary of the small
investor who doesn't have time or inclination to challenge the
marketplace. What could be simpler, such people reason, than to
turn over funds to professionals?
   The problem with this reasoning, as experienced investors know,
is that there are good funds, mediocre funds and poor ones, just as
there are superior stocks, ordinary stocks and stocks that go
nowhere but down.
   While that can be surprising enough to some folks, it is nothing
compared to the shock of finding, as many will, that they have
incurred taxes while losing money, thanks to the 1986 tax law.
   Howard Ruff, publisher of The Ruff Times, a widely circulated
economic newsletter, calls attention to this bizarre twist. Its
elements are easy to follow:
   1. Unlike individual investors who can decide when to buy or
sell an investment, a mutual fund investor leaves that decision to
the fund's manager.
   2. When a fund sells investments, 98 percent of the net gains
must be paid out as a distribution to the fund's shareholders.
   3. The money is either given in cash or automatically reinvested
in more fund shares. But either way, the shareholder must pay tax
on the distribution. All shareholders in the fund are equally
liable.
   4. However, because the fund made money on its investment does
not mean the shareholder made money on his or her investment. It's
a matter of timing.
   5. That timing becomes especially relevant because of the
enormous, 5-year price runup of many funds _ and the sudden
collapse on Oct. 19. Those who were with the fund for five years
did indeed gain; many others didn't.
   6. For example, an individual who bought on Oct. 15 might have
paid a premium for fund shares. The fund then sold some investments
for a profit. The investor didn't share in those profits _ but he
is taxed as if he did.
   7. Making the situation more outrageous, says Ruff, is that such
an investor might have seen his investment plummet, for two reasons:
   First, whenever a fund makes a distribution, the fund's net
asset value is reduced by the amount of the distribution. Secondly,
the crash reduced the value even more, in some instances by huge
percentages.
   Ruff offers this example:
   ``Let's say you paid $18.11 per share for a fund after Bloody
Monday. Since then the fund has distributed $2.42 in capital gains.
   ``The net asset value of the fund was reduced by the $2.42
distribution, and has subsequently fallen another 34 cents. But,
since you must pay 68 cents in capital gains taxes on the $2.42
distribution, your real loss is $1.02.''
   Remember, the fund might have had a gain on the particular stock
it sold. You might not have had a gain, and you might have had a
loss. It doesn't matter.
   This is the worst of both worlds, says Ruff. ``First you get
zapped by the bear market, then Uncle Sam rubs salt in the wound by
taxing a gain you never realized.''

   The stock market lapsed into a broad decline
today in an atmosphere of caution heading into the long
Easter-Passover weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.95 to 1,968.17
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 381 up, 913
down and 488 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to carry big positions
through the weekend, especially with a Labor Department report
coming Friday on the employment situation for March.
   Both the stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday, and
thus will not have a chance to respond to any surprises in the
employment data until Monday.
   In the last set of figures, a much stronger-than-expected
increase in nonfarm payroll employment dealt the bond market a
sharp setback.
   Brokers said money managers at investing institutions had pretty
much completed maneuvers to ready their portfolios for reports to
clients on their performance in the first quarter, which ends with
today's trading.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Motors, down { at
70}; Merck, down 1{ at 156; International Paper, down 1 at 40\, and
Procter & Gamble, down { at 77|.
   Atlantic Richfield rose 1{ to 83. The company said its
first-quarter earnings are expected to come in above $2 a share,
against $1.31 in the comparable period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.77 to 145.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .51 at 293.16.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 67.27 million shares at
noontime, down from 74.81 million at the same point Wednesday.

   House and Senate negotiators broke a
longstanding deadlock today and moved to place sharp import curbs
on Toshiba Corp. and a subsidiary for selling submarine-silencing
equipment to the Soviets.
   Approval of the Toshiba provision as part of a sweeping trade
bill came despite Reagan administration opposition and a major
lobbying campaign by the Japanese electronics manufacturer.
   On the eve of the action, several Cabinet officials warned
lawmakers that a stringent punishment for Toshiba could precipitate
a presidential veto of the 1,000-page trade bill. They said the
president should have more flexibility in determining national
security and trade relations with other countries.
   ``I was elected as a U.S. senator to represent the State of Utah
in the U.S. Senate and not Toshiba and not England and not the
State Department and not Frank Carlucci,'' declared Sen. Jake Garn,
R-Utah, in urging lawmakers to defy administration opposition.
   He said he was embarrassed that a Republican administration
would fight the sanctions, adding, ``The State Department has been
kicked in the shins and instead of saying ouch they have chosen to
surrender.
   The provision was accepted by a subcommittee of a House-Senate
conference committee working on a compromise version of the trade
bill.
   It would ban for three years U.S. government procurement of
Toshiba Corp. products. The company has massive sales within the
United States of televisions, microwaves and other electronic
products.
   It would ban import for three years of products manufactured by
Toshiba Machine Corp., the subsidiary involved with the Norwegian
firm of Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk in selling sophisticated
computerized milling equipment to the Soviets that the
administration says has greatly submarine propeller noise.
   There would be exemptions for national security.
   The measure also provides for a two to five-year ban in the
future on imports of products by foreign makers that violate the
so-called Cocom agreement under which western nations act to keep
high-tech equipment with military uses out of communist hands. But
the president could waive such action against parent companies in
some cases.
   Lawmakers are pushing to put the finishing touches on the trade
bill before starting on their spring break.
   ``We're going to give it our best,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, said Wednesday as a House-Senate conference committee
plowed through a stack of proposals but stopped short of the big
decisions.
   Congress wants to have all the provisions wrapped up except a
few minor loose ends before heading for its spring break at the end
of the week.
   The committee, attempting to fashion a compromise between rival
1,000-page trade bills passed by the two houses, heard Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., appeal to lawmakers to save the heart of his
controversial trade plan.
   The plan to force 10 percent annual reductions in unfair
surpluses that other countries run with the United States formed
the centerpiece of Gephardt's abandoned campaign for president.
   He said any final version should focus on key countries that
make unfair trade practices part of a systematic trade strategy.
Wholesale negotiations should be shunned in favor of working on
major trade trouble spots, he said.
   Mandatory retaliation is needed when negotiations fail, he said.
``You have to have a stick in the closet,'' he said. But he added
that flexibility is necessary in dealing with trading partners and
the president should have the power to waive retaliation.

<HEAD>Trump Gives Up Tender Offer for Resorts International Stock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER GILLOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Donald Trump gave up his $22-a-share
tender offer for the Resorts International Inc. stock he doesn't
own, saying he is confident a takeover bid by
entertainer-businessman Merv Griffin will never be approved.
   Control of Resorts International is now held by Trump, who owns
nearly all of Resorts' 572,000 Class B shares that have 100 votes
each, giving him 88 percent of the company's voting power.
   On Wednesday, Griffin revised his offer for $36 a share for all
of the company's Class A stock and called for Resorts to sell
Griffin 1.2 million new Class B shares at the same price. The new
stock would give Griffin voting control.
   The company has 5.7 million Class A common shares that have one
vote each.
   Trump said late Wednesday he will return all tendered shares
after his offer. The merger agreement expires at midnight tonight.
   Trump said he will never sell his Class B stock and will not pay
more than $22 for Class A stock.
   Griffin said Wednesday he is no longer making his offer
contingent upon Trump tendering his Class B stock or terminating a
five-year management contract valued at about $100 million for
Resorts' hotel-casinos in New Jersey and the Bahamas.
   Consummation of the offer would result in Griffin owning a
majority of the voting power and more than 90 percent of the equity
of Resorts.
   Trump would be able to participate in Griffin's new offer only
by converting his stock to Class A shares.
   Griffin, through his privately held investment firm, Griffin
Co., made his revised offer to Resorts' outside directors, noting
he believes only those board members should vote on the proposal.
   ``The other directors have interests in Mr. Trump's competing
bid,'' Griffin said.
   Three of Resorts' six directors are nominees of Trump, who is
the company's chairman.
   Resorts referred media inquiries to Trump. Trump's attorney,
Jack Nusbaum of New York, said Trump would continue to use his
voting power to resist Griffin's offer and it was unlikely Resorts'
outside directors would meet independently to consider the proposal.
   Trump is offering $22 a share to buy the Resorts stock he
doesn't already own and take the company private.
   In mid-March, Griffin countered with a bid of $35 a share, or
$225 million, for all of the company's stock, but it was contingent
upon Trump tendering his stock and terminating the management pact.
Trump has repeatedly indicated he wouldn't agree to either
contingency.
   Griffin subsequently said he would boost his bid to $295
million, with Resorts' board members able to decide how to
apportion the additional $70 million between Class A and Class B
holders. The move was seen as a way to pay a higher price to Trump,
but the New Yorker again said he wasn't interested.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Says It Pays To Shop Around for Long-Distance Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-distance calling options are many and
prices are competitive, but residential consumers as well as small
and larger businesses still can save money by shopping around,
according to a private survey.
   The report by the Telecommunications Research & Action Center
shows that most of the long-distance companies offer various
calling plans, each one benefiting different calling patterns.
   The nonprofit, consumer group recommends that residential
consumers periodically compare available options _ annually for
those whose long-distance costs are less than $10 per month and
more often when monthly bills are more than $25.
   Though cost gaps between competing companies and plans have
narrowed, ``the risk in picking the wrong plan can result in paying
substantially more in long-distance service,'' said Samuel A.
Simon, a consultant to the consumer group.
   The survey outlined the options available from eight of the
largest long-distance carriers and the costs, calculated in various
call volumes, of the plans.
   The survey also compared costs for businesses that spend up to
$8,000 a month on long-distance calling. For these business
callers, some of the calling plans available _ including new
``virtual WATS'' plans _ can save 25 percent over standard rates of
even the lowest cost companies, TRAC says.
   Unlike traditional WATS service, the new ``virtual WATS'' plans
offered by all the major companies require no special installation
or dedicated lines.
   The residential and small business comparisons include the
option of access-code dialing, or casual calling, which allows a
caller to reach a long-distance carrier other than their chosen one
by dialing an access code, 10 plus a different three-digit number
for each company. This option can be cheaper than some ``dial 1''
plans at lower call volumes, but volume discounts are generally not
available with code dialing.
   A comparison of the costs for a sample residential monthly bill
_ 20 calls totaling 380 minutes, 70 percent of which are calculated
at night-weekend rates _ showed AT&T's Reach Out America bonus plan
was the cheapest at $53.84.
   MidAmerica standard service followed at $54.06, US Sprint
standard service at $54.60, AT&T's Reach Out America basic plan at
$55.14, US Sprint 10333 and 10777 access at $55.24, MCI standard
rates at $55.62.
   When a sampling of 33 calls were priced, US Sprint standard
rates were least expensive, followed by US Sprint 10333 and 10777
access, MCI standard rates, MCI's Prime Calling Option and the AT&T
Reach Out America plans.
   Another sample of 20 calls, this time with 70 percent of the 380
minutes calculated at daytime rates, was analyzed to assess the
costs a small business might pay. In that comparison, MCI standard
rates were least expensive at $88.88, followed by US Sprint
standard rates at $89.32, Allnet standard service at $89.95, TDX
standard service at $90.08, and MCI 10222 access at $90.03.
   The survey's residential and small business results are
available in a chart for $1, the business chart for $10. Include a
stamped, self-addressed, business-size envelope and mail to TRAC,
P.O. Box 12038, Washington, D.C. 20005.

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Fall to Lowest Levels in Nearly Six Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBIN STAINER</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa prices reacted to forecasts of large world
surpluses by falling Thursday to their lowest levels in nearly six
years, traders said.
   Cocoa beans for May delivery fell to $1,692 a metric ton, $30
lower than overnight levels and their lowest price since mid-1982.
   Traders said the market reflected the prospect of a fourth
consecutive season of surpluses, with record world production
forecast in the current season running from October 1987 to
September 1988.
   International merchants Gill and Duffus said in a report
released Thursday that, based on expected record crops in the Ivory
Coast, Brazil and Malaysia, it is forecasting 1987-88 world output
to hit a record 2.106 million tons _ up six percent from 1986-87.
   They said this ``remarkable growth'' in production would cause
output to exceed consumption by 122,000 metric tons, despite a 3.6
percent rise in consumption over 1986-87.
   Such an imbalance would take accumulated inventories by the end
of the present season to 713,000 tons, the highest since 1964-65,
they said.
   The Ivory Coast crop is estimated to be 630,000 tons compared
with 590,000 in 1986-87; Brazil's 426,000 tons vs. 369,000; and
Malaysia's 190,000, up from 164,000.
   Gill and Duffus projected Nigerian output will be 135,000 tons,
up 55,000 tons from 1986-87 and the biggest since 1984-85. Ghana's

   The stock market drifted in a narrow range today
in an atmosphere of caution heading into the long Easter-Passover
weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 10 points at
its midsession low, was up 4.64 at 1,982.76 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 545 up, 853 down and
504 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to carry big positions
through the weekend, especially with a Labor Department report
coming Friday on the employment situation for March.
   Both the stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday, and
thus will not have a chance to respond to any surprises in the
employment data until Monday.
   In the last set of figures, a much stronger-than-expected
increase in nonfarm payroll employment dealt the bond market a
sharp setback.
   Brokers said money managers at investing institutions had pretty
much completed maneuvers to ready their portfolios for reports to
clients on their performance in the first quarter, which ends with
today's trading.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up 2| at 107}; American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at
26}; Exxon, up { at 42\, and American Express, up | at 24].
   Atlantic Richfield rose 2 to 83{. The company said its
first-quarter earnings are expected to come in above $2 a share,
against $1.31 in the comparable period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.02 to 146.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .54 at 294.21.

<TEXT>
   In new public service commercials for the United
Way, a mugger tears a coat off the back of a homeless man, an
assailant grabs an unsuspecting woman and an older man is felled at
the office by a heart attack.
   By the end of the 30-second ads, the homeless man gets a new
coat, the distraught woman dresses up to face the world again and
the older man enjoys restored health on a beach.
   They each got help from agencies assisted by donations to the
United Way.
   Roberta van der Voort, a senior vice president of United Way of
America Inc., said Thursday that by showing people the ``vital
link'' between their donations and good deeds, the ads may help
dispell skepticism about charitable organizations.
   Ruth Wooden, president of the Advertising Council, the
non-profit organization that oversees $1.1 billion a year in public
service advertising, said the United Way is the first organization
to address the issues of homelessness and rape in a national
advertising campaign.
   She said she expects ``exceptionally strong media play'' for the
campaign with the media donating more than $70 million in free time
and space this year, up from $40 million donated for the national
United Way campaign last year.
   The ads were created by the New York-based agency Lowe Marschalk
Inc., which took over responsibility for the campaign this year.
The ads continue the theme ``The United Way. It brings out the best
in all of us.''
   Van der Voort said the United Way raised about $2.6 billion last
year and channelled the money to 37,000 agencies that help people
in some way.
   But she said research showed many people were unaware that
United Way donations helped organizations such as the Salvation
Army provide coats to the homeless, rape crisis centers counsel
abused women and the Red Cross provide training that often helps
save the lives of heart attack victims.
   She said Lowe Marschalk was asked to ``tell a story in 30
seconds'' that demonstrates how donations help people in the
community.
   ``Twenty minutes ago, this man's last shred of dignity was
stripped right off his back,'' a narrator says in the spot where a
mugger tears the coat from a homeless man.
   ``Where do you go when your world is this cold, this cruel,''
the voice asks as the homeless man shivers in the shadow of a stone
column.
   The commercial then shows the man putting on a new coat, as Lowe
Marschalk makes the connection it has been asked to draw in three
succinct phrases.
   ``He got help at the Salvation Army. They got help from the
United Way. Thank God, the United Way got help from you,'' the
narrator says.
   The Advertising Council is distributing the commercials and
radio versions of the ads to networks, cable outlets and local
stations across the country. Print versions of the campaign should
be ready in a month, said Lowe Marschalk's president, Andrew J.
Langer.
   The agency has previously created public service campaigns for a
free press, Amnesty International and the city of New York.

<HEAD>Company, Two Executives Fined $604,000 For Using Foreign Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company fined $604,000 for using foreign-made
steel in hacksaws sold to the government will appeal a verdict that
found it violated the Buy American Act, its attorney said Thursday.
   ``It is not a rational interpretation of the Buy American Act,''
said Jerome Facher, who represented Rule Industries in the case.
   A U.S. District Court jury on Wednesday convicted Rule
Industries and two of its executives of 302 violations of the act,
which calls for goods purchased by the federal government for
public use be manfactured with mostly American-made parts.
   The number of violations corresponds with the number of invoices
the company submitted during its contracts with the General
Services Administration in 1981 and 1982 totaling $1.3 million.
   The jury ruled the company was liable because it purchased
10-inch steel ``blanks'' from suppliers in Sweden and Japan. The
blanks were milled, hardened and tempered in the United States.
   Rulings in the case indicated that it would not have been a
violation of the act had Gloucester-based Rule Industries purchased
sheets or coils of steel from foreign suppliers and cut the blanks
from them.
   ``The act is really being interpreted in a bizarre fashion,''
Facher said. ``It's a very complex and old piece of legislation
that dates back to the Depression and has never really been
definitively interpreted by a court.''
   The case is believed to be the first jury trial in the
enforcement of the 55-year-old act, U.S. Attorney Frank L. McNamara
Jr. said.
   McNamara had filed a civil lawsuit in 1985 against Rule
Industries, a diversified manufacturer of marine and hardware
products; its president, William Anastos, and its vice president,
Gary Sable. Each was charged with violating the act.
   The jury said the defendants falsely represented that domestic
steel was used to fulfill four contracts with the GSA, the main
contracting arm of the federal government.
   Rule Industries officials had said when the suit was filed the
GSA was well aware of its steel-purchasing practices.
   During the trial, several former employees testified that Rule
Industries executives hid the source of the steel by destroying
containers shipped from overseas, blackening out foreign markings
and removing shipping labels from packages.
   ``There were a number of very honest employees who got offended
when their company lied to the government,'' said Richard Stearns,
a first assistant U.S. attorney.

<HEAD>Federated Board Puts Off Decision After Macy Revises Bid</HEAD>

   The board of Federated Department Stores Inc.
put off until Friday a decision on whether to reaffirm its merger
agreement with R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. or accept the competing bid of
Campeau Corp.
   In a statement today, Federated said both suitors presented
revised bids of more than $6.6 billion each to the board at its
day-long meeting Wednesday.
   The board had been expected to announce today whether it would
reaffirm its support for its agreement with Macy or reverse itself
and choose Campeau's offer.
   However, Federated said Macy submitted another revised offer
this morning and the board would meet again Friday morning to
consider both bids.
   For the first time since it announced its cash-and-stock offer a
month ago, Macy put a value on the stock end of its bid and also
gave shareholders the option of taking all cash for their shares,
Federated said in a statement.
   In its bid today, Macy offered $78.92 a share in cash for 80
percent of Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares, and said it
would pay $60 in cash or exchange five shares in a new company,
Macy's-Federated Inc., for each remaining Federated share.
   The deal had a blended value of $75.14 a share, or a total of
$6.73 billion, Federated said.
   In its latest bid, Campeau offered to pay $74 a share for
approximately 80 percent of Federated's shares, and the same amount
for the remaining 20 percent after a merger, Federated said. That
would make the Toronto-based developer's bid worth $6.62 billion.
   Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.
in Los Angeles, said Macy had an edge over Campeau with the offers
now on the table, but he cautioned, ``Campeau could always come out
and say they're going to offer a higher bid.''
   Wall Street analysts had said Macy would be forced to put a
value on the ``stub'' _ or securities _ portion of its offer to
compete with Campeau. Many investors, including arbitragers who
hold a sizeable portion of Federated stock, were leaning toward the
certainty of Campeau's all-cash offer.
   Investors reacted enthusiastically to the higher bidding.
Federated stock was up $2.25 to $72.50 in early afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Before Wednesday's meeting, Campeau offered $73 a share in cash,
or $6.53 billion. Campeau had said it would pay $82 each for 70.5
million Federated shares and $37 for each of the remainder of
Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares in a subsequent merger.
   Campeau also had proposed a friendly merger under which it would
pay $73 a share for 70.5 million shares in a tender offer and $73
for the remaining shares following the merger.
   Macy's offer prior to the Federated board meeting on Wednesday
was $77.35 a share in cash for 70.43 million Federated shares, for
a total of $5.4 billion. Macy said it would exchange shares in the
merged company and issue convertible debt securities for the
remainder of Federated's shares. Analysts valued the offer at $6.3
billion.
   Federated said Macy presented an offer at the meeting similar to
today's proposal, but which had an aggregate value of $73.88 a
share or a total of $6.61 billion. That offer was superseded by
today's bid.
   Campeau had no comment on the latest Macy bid, Campeau
spokeswoman Joele Frank said.
   Federated gave Macy Chairman Edward Finkelstein and Campeau
Chairman Robert Campeau the opportunity to address the board on
Wednesday, but the New York Times reported in today's editions that
Campeau declined to appear. Finkelstein spoke to the directors and
presented ``his vision of the combined company,'' the Times said.
   Campeau has fought the merger agreement Federated forged with
Macy a month ago with lawsuits and higher bids. If Federated's
directors again select Macy's offer, Toronto-based Campeau is
expected to continue in court the battle it began with a
$47-a-share offer on Jan. 25.
   Macy's offer was scheduled to expire Monday. The expiration of
the Campeau offer was uncertain, pending completion of financing
requirements for the acquisition.
   Federated had given both companies the chance to submit what it
called ``final bids'' after Campeau's most recent offer.
   On Tuesday, the companies were in court after Federated
announced procedures for the submission of final offers. Campeau
objected to the guidelines on grounds they favored Macy, but U.S.
District Judge Leonard Sand denied the Canadian company's request
for a temporary restraining order blocking the procedures.
   Campeau argued the procedures were illegal because they embraced
Federated's ``poison pill'' takeover defense and agreements between
Federated and Macy.
   Federated asked that whichever company was not chosen either
terminate its offer or extend it for 30 business days. An extension
would give the advantage to whichever company Federated backed,
because shareholders would likely tender their shares to the suitor
whose offer expired first.
   Sand stipulated that Federated could not invoke defensive
measures _ including its controversial poison pill _ before the
losing party had a chance to challenge those measures in court.
   The poison pill would make a takeover attempt more expensive by
allowing the retailer's shareholders to buy more company stock at a
discount, unless Federated's management supported the bid. Campeau
had sought unsuccessfully in court to have the pill invalidated.
   Campeau also objected to an agreement under which Federated
would pay Macy ``break-up'' fees if a Macy-Federated merger failed
for reasons other than a Macy default.
   Federated's divisions include Bloomingdale's, Burdine's,
Filene's, Foley's, Lazarus and Rich's department stores; Ralphs
supermarkets; Gold Circle discount stores; and Main Street and
Children's Place specialty stores.
   Macy owns nearly 100 department and specialty stores.
   Campeau, which started in real estate development in Canada,
moved into the U.S. retail market at the end of 1986 by acquiring
Allied Stores Corp.

<HEAD>PIP Agrees to $67.9 Million Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Postal Instant Press Inc., the nation's
largest franchiser of printing centers, said Thursday it has agreed
to be taken private by a management-led investor group for $67.9
million, or $17.41 per share.
   The pact ends six weeks of on-again, off-again acquisition
negotiations.
   An earlier, $17-per-share bid by the management group, headed by
PIP's chief executive Thomas Marotto, was permitted to expire two
weeks ago when the company entered into talks with an unidentified
third party that was offering $17.50 per share, or $68.25 million.
   However, PIP said Thursday that ``serious questions arose as to
the firmness of that offer'' and Marotto's group boosted its bid.
   PIP has 3.9 million shares outstanding.
   Marotto's group includes the Chicago-based investment firm of
Golder Thoma & Cressey, which specializes in leveraged buyouts in
which the assets of the firm being acquired are pledged as
collateral to line up takeover financing.
   PIP has about 1,000 printing centers in the United States,
Canada and the United Kingdom, all but a few of them franchised.
   Last year, the company escaped a hostile bid by Tarrytown,
N.Y.-based Kane-Miller Corp.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. illegally charged $100
deductibles to perform some automobile repairs it should have done
in New York State for free under the state's lemon law, a mid-level
state appeals court ruled.
   The Appellate Division of the state's Supreme Court decided
Thursday that Ford was ``unjustly enriched'' by charging New York
consumers the deductibles and must make restitution.
   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams contended in court
that the state's 1983 lemon law, designed to provide New Yorkers
with replacement vehicles or money back if their new cars exhibit
irreparable flaws, did not allow Ford to impose the deductibles.
   According to court papers, Ford paid the cost of all repairs for
its new cars during the first 12 months or 12,000 miles. But under
an extended limited warranty, the automaker charged $100 each time
it made repairs to the power train and other major components of
cars with 12,000 to 18,000 miles or between one and two years old.
   Abrams argued in court that the state's lemon law prohibits
automakers from imposing a deductible for repairs on new cars
during their first 18,000 miles or two years.
   A state Supreme Court justice in Albany, Harold Hughes, ruled in
December 1986 that the lemon law prohibits Ford from imposing the
deductibles, but he did not order the automaker to provide
restitution.
   In the 5-0 ruling by the appellate division Thursday, however,
Presiding Justice A. Franklin Mahoney said he and his colleagues
``choose to exercise our discretion'' by ordering Ford to give the
money back.
   Mahoney rejected arguments by Ford attorneys that New York's
lemon law is unconstitutional and that it violates interstate
commerce laws.
   Mahoney conceded that while Ford may not have detailed records
of all customers it improperly charged for repairs, ``it would not
be impracticable to give purchasers during the relevant time period
a general notice and a time period to come forward.''
   Mahoney sent the matter back to the state Supreme Court level to
devise an ``appropriate restitution procedure'' for Ford to follow.
   He was joined in his decision by state Supreme Court Justices T.
Paul Kane, John Casey, Leonard Weiss and Thomas Mercure.
   Nancy Connell, a spokeswoman for Abrams, said the attorney
general's office has no accurate total of how many New Yorkers were
improperly charged the deductibles. But she said it's believed
refunds could total ``in the millions of dollars.''
   Philip Lacovara, a Washington-based attorney who represented
Ford in the case, did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment.
   The ruling could be appealed to the state's highest court, the
Court of Appeals.

   Wall Street ``whiz kid'' David Bloom pleaded
guilty to mail and securities fraud today for allegedly bilking
investors out of $10 million which the 23-year-old sunk into art
work, cars and two fully furnished homes for himself.
   ``I said I was a money manager, but I did not invest their money
as I told them I would,'' the baby-faced 1986 Duke University
graduate told U.S. District Judge David Edelstein.
   Bloom told duped investors that he also represented the
Rockefeller family, the Sultan of Brunei and Bill Cosby, even
though he didn't.
   Bloom, who was once profiled in a New York Times Magazine
feature on new art collectors, faces five years in prison and a
maximum fine of double the amount lost by investors at his May 12
sentencing. No sentencing agreement accompanied his guilty plea.
   Wearing a dark gray suit, white shirt and blue tie, Bloom stood
with his hands behind his back and politely answered Edelstein's
questions about the scam during a 25-minute hearing.
   Asked if he realized his ``money management'' operation was
illegal, Bloom responded, ``Yes, your honor.''
   According to court papers, Bloom _ who was not licensed as an
investment advisor _ used his clients' funds to buy $5.5 million in
art work; a $1.9 million East Hampton beach house; an $830,000
Manhattan apartment; $800,000 in furnishings for the two homes; and
two cars worth $200,000.
   The defendant also bought ``numerous items of expensive jewelry
and deluxe trips to the Caribbean'' for himself, family and
friends, federal prosecutors charged.
   All the art work will be auctioned at Sotheby's near the end of
May, with the chance that some investors could still make a profit,
said Bloom's attorney, Peter Morrison.
   Bloom was arrested Jan. 14 on a federal complaint; he had 130
clients at his Greater Sutton Investors at the time of his arrest.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mixed Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade in light trading ahead of two
important government reports and the three-day holiday weekend,
analysts said.
   The Agriculture Department's annual report on spring planting
intentions and its quarterly report on grain stocks, both due out
after the close on Thursday, were expected to set the trend for
corn and soybean futures prices for the next 30 days.
   Together, the reports were expected to indicate whether futures
prices should go higher to encourage more planting to meet the
expected demand, or lower to discourage plantings, analysts said.
   The reports were to be released at 2 p.m. CST. The markets
cannot react until Monday, however, because they will be closed
Friday.
   Soybean prices advanced in Thursday's session while wheat and
corn prices retreated.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 3\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $2.99 a bushel; corn was { cent

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Thursday it
plans a broad series of joint ventures with Siemens A.G., the giant
European electrical equipment manufacturer.
   ``These agreements will strengthen the competitive position of
both companies in today's global markets by combining our
respective world-leading technologies and capabilities,''
Westinghouse Chairman John C. Marous said in announcing the signing
of a letter of intent.
   The two companies together will make, sell and service factory
automation equipment, industrial circuit breakers and industrial
controls, Westinghouse said. The joint ventures, covering more than
20 products, will operate in selected world markets, including the
United States.
   Westinghouse, the largest U.S. electrical equipment
manufacturer, said it will own 51 percent of the joint ventures,
which will need the approval of government regulators and directors
of both companies..
   Westinghouse and Siemens have cooperated in various ways as
customers and in licensing agreements for more than 50 years,
Marous said.
   The approximately 358,000 employees of Munich-based Siemens
generated 1987 sales of $30.4 billion. The 110,000 employees of
Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse generated 1987 sales of $10.7 billion.
   The joint ventures in factory automation will combine existing
Westinghouse operations that employ 2,700 people, 1,700 of them in
the United States, and Siemens operations in Peabody, Mass., and
Roswell, Ga., employing 370 people.
   Businesses will be created to fulfill plans for the other two
areas, industrial circuit breakers and industrial controls, said
Westinghouse spokesman James P. Schmitt.

   The stock market declined slightly today in an
atmosphere of caution heading into the long Easter-Passover weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.66 to 1,976.46

   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in the overall tally

out Friday on the employment situation for March.
   Both the stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday, and
thus will not have a chance to respond to any surprises in the
employment data until Monday.
   In the last monthly set of figures, a much
stronger-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll employment dealt
the bond market a sharp setback.
   Brokers said money managers at investing institutions had pretty
much completed maneuvers to ready their portfolios for reports to
clients on their performance in the first quarter, which ends with
today's trading.
   Atlantic Richfield rose 2 to 83{. The company said its
first-quarter earnings are expected to come in above $2 a share,
against $1.31 in the comparable period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .31 to 145.91. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .34 at 294.01.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 114.31 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>Sears Applies for Second Bank in Delaware</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck & Co. has filed with the
state to charter a second bank in Delaware.
   Sears, which already owns Greenwood Trust Co., has filed an
application to open a credit card bank called Discover Card Bank of
New Castle, Susan L. Winters, acting deputy bank commissioner, said
Wednesday.
   The filing comes under that part of Delaware law that pertains
to any new bank being established in the state. A hearing is set
for May 2 on the application.
   Sears issues its Discover credit card through Greenwood Trust,
which it acquired in 1985.
   Ms. Winters said Sears plans to transfer some of Greenwood
Trust's credit card acounts to the new bank if it is approved.
   Under federal banking laws, the growth of non-banks, which
includes Greenwood Trust, are restricted. Ms. Winter said the new
bank's ability to grow would not be restricted.
   When the federal law restricting the growth of non-banks was
filed, ``Sears made a commitment to look for ways to continue to
make credit card loans,'' said Paul Marrone for Dean Witter
Reynolds, the Sears subsidiary that oversees Discover Card
operations.
   ``The application we have filed is a first step in the
development of that commitment,'' Marrone said.

<HEAD>Bonds Sold To Finance Kohlberg's Buyout of Jim Walter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what is being billed as one of the largest
non-government issues in history, $1.45 billion in bonds have been
sold to help Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. pay off bank loans from
its buyout of Jim Walter Corp.
   Kohlberg Kravis took Jim Walters private last year for about
$2.4 billion, about $2 billion of which was financed by bank loans.
Since then the New York-based investment firm has been selling
selected Jim Walter's assets to help finance the deal.
   Jim Walter, which has its headquarters in Tampa, Fla., is a
diversified building materials and natural resources company that
operates primarily in the South and Southwest. It also is one of
the country's largest home builders, specializing in inexpensive,
partially finished ``shell'' houses.
   Walter had 74,000 single-family mortgages in 22 states totaling
$1.74 billion that were packaged together to back the bond issue.
   ``KKR realized they had a very unusual asset in these
mortgages,'' said Peter Hoey, senior vice president of Financial
Security Assurance.
   Hoey said the bond issue was ``totally sold out to a blue-chip
list'' comprised of large pension funds, life insurance companies
and banks from around the world.
   The mortgages were sold to a special trust and used to back the
bond issue, which Financial Security guaranteed with a triple-A
rating.
   Homeowners pay their morgtages into the trust, which has a
cushion to protect against any defaults by homeowners. That cash
flow will pay the interest on the bonds, which were sold in five
different maturities, each carrying a different interest rate.
   ``The purpose was not to take weak credit and make it triple-A
and take on risk, but to take complex and unusual collateral that
the marketplace has difficulty understanding'' and package it to
sell, Hoey said.
   The average buyer of a Jim Walter home requires a low-cost
mortgage and therefore is not a typical homebuyer.
   Jim Walter does not provide the land on which its houses are
built, which cuts down on the price of the homes. In addition, the
company leaves its houses as much as 30 percent incomplete, making
them affordable to blue-collar, first-time homebuyers, Hoey said.
   Kohlberg Kravis has spearheaded a number of major leveraged
buyouts, including the $6.2 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos. The
company said this week that it is seeking permission to acquire up
to 15 percent of Texaco Inc.

   Assets of the nation's 420 money market mutual
funds fell $548.4 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $278.23 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $730.3 million drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 210 general purpose funds rose $624.5 million to $82.86
billion, assets of 98 broker-dealer funds dropped $620.2 million to
$117.04 billion, and assets of 112 institutional funds declined
$552.7 million to $78.33 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds was
unchanged in the week ended Tuesday at 6.04 percent, according to
Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in Holliston,
Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 6.05 percent from 6.07 percent
the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, down from 44 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was
unchanged from a week earlier at 5.70 percent as of Wednesday.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was also unchanged, at 5.15 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.78
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 6.79 the
previous week. Yields were 7.12 percent on 1-year CDs, unchanged;
7.53 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.52 percent; and 7.99 percent
on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

   Fremont General Corp. said Thursday
it has agreed to sell all of its property and casualty insurance
operations to a management-led group for $82 million in cash, notes
and stock warrants.
   The operations are being acquired by a new company formed by
managers of a Fremont General subsidiary, Fremont Insurance Co.
   Being sold are Fremont Indemnity Co., Fremont Comspensation
Insurance Co., Fremont Reinsurance Co. and Comstock Insurance Co.
The latter two operations were discontinued last year, and Fremont
General sought unsuccessfully to spin off the first two to
shareholders.
   Upon completion of the deal, Fremont General will remain a
financial services concern with commercial and life insurance
operations, a real estate finance unit and half ownership of a
workers compensation insurance firm. It also is awaiting regulatory
approval to acquire Malibu Savings & Loan Association.
   Under terms of the deal announced Thursday, Fremont General will
receive $20 million in cash, a 90-day note for $5 million,
preferred stock with warrants to purchase 9.9 percent of the
buyer's outstanding shares valued at $35 million, and a 10-year
zero-coupon note valued at $22 million.

<HEAD>Resorts Stock Falls as Trump Ends Bid, Vows to Block Griffin Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of Resorts International Inc. stock
slumped Thursday as investor Donald Trump, who holds 88 percent of
the company's voting power, withdrew his bid to take the
hotel-casino operator private and indicated he would block a
higher, rival offer by entertainer Merv Griffin.
   Resorts' Class A stock fell by $1.62{ per share to $28.87{ in
trading on the American Stock Exchange.
   Griffin's bid, which was revised Wednesday for the second time,
was an attempt to make an end run around Trump's repeated
objections and force Resorts' outside directors to vote on the plan
free of Trump's influence.
   ``The Delaware courts have consistently ruled that a
corporation's outside directors are charged with the duty to
conduct a fair bidding contest,'' the Griffin Co. said Thursday.
   ``Outside directors have been authorized by the courts to take
all reasonable steps, including diluting a major shareholder, in
order to obtain the best deal for the public shareholders.''
   However, some analysts were skeptical of whether Griffin could
succeed.
   ``Because Griffin's offer is conditional, they (Resorts' outside
directors) have an out. They can simply refuse to consider it on
grounds that it is unlikely it would be able to succeed,'' said Lee
Isgur, a leisure-time industry analyst with PaineWebber in New York.
   Resorts' board, composed of Trump and two of his nominees plus
three outside directors, is scheduled to meet Monday. Trump is
chairman of Resorts.
   Griffin's latest proposal dropped two previous conditions _ that
Trump agree to sell his stock and terminate a lucrative five-year
contract to operate Resorts properties in New Jersey and the
Bahamas.
   Instead, Griffin imposed a new contingency _ that Resorts agree
to sell him 1.2 million new shares of Class B stock, which carries
100 votes per share and would give Griffin more votes that Trump.
   Trump owns nearly all of the company's current 572,000 Class B
shares.
   He was offering $22 per share for the company's 5.7 million
Class A shares, which carry only one vote per share and hence only
12 percent of the company's voting strentgh. But he said the offer
was allowed to expire at 12:01 a.m. Friday and all tendered shares
will be returned to their owners.
   Griffin is offering $36 per share for the Class A stock, and the
same price for the 1.2 million new Class B shares he is seeking.
   Attorney Alan Applebauam, who represents the independent
directors, indicated that he feels all Resorts directors including
those nominated by Trump have the right to vote on Griffin's merger
proposal.
   But he said that the question of whether only outside directors
should vote on the proposal to issue new Class B stock to Griffin
``is a matter for further research.''
   Trump's attorney, Jack Nusbaum, reiterated that he feels the
full board should take up Griffin's offer.

<TEXT>
   The dollar headed lower Thursday in subdued,
pre-holiday dealings.
   Gold lost ground in domestic trading after rising overseas.
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $454 a troy
ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $456.25 late Wednesday.
   Traders said the dollar moved in a narrow range throughout the
session, closing near its opening levels. Most of the pressure on
the currency came earlier in overseas trading, said Stephen Dakin,
foreign exchange manager at Union Bank of Switzerland.
   The Japanese yen and the British pound remained very strong,
which served to ``drag the dollar down and push other (major)
currencies up,'' Dakin said.
   Traders spent the session squaring up their positions ahead of
the Easter and Passover holiday weekend. Many dealers did not plan
to trade on Friday, while others said they would work only half a
day.
   ``You won't see a real market back until Tuesday,'' said Lou
Calvello, a trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., in
reference to the four-day weekend European dealers are taking.
   Trading also was thin in Europe, where the dollar fell to a
six-year low against the pound.
   The British currency continued to draw strength from Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's comments late Wednesday that
fighting inflation takes priority over maintaining a stable
exchange rate, dealers said.
   The Bank of England reportedly intervened briefly in the early
going in an effort to stem the pound's strong advance, but the
currency continued to climb later in the afternoon.
   In London, the dollar hit its lowest level against the pound
since January 1982. It cost $1.8878 to buy one pound, more
expensive than $1.8790 late Wednesday. In New York, one pound cost
$1.8874, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.8780.
   Earlier in Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's
begins, the dollar dropped against the Japanese yen to close at the
day's low of 124.50 yen, down 0.93 yen from Wednesday.
   Later in London, the dollar fell further and was quoted at
124.15 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 124.35 yen, down from
125.025 yen on Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday, included: 1.65875 West German marks, down from 1.66285;
1.3650 Swiss francs, down from 1.37215; 5.6170 French francs, down
from 5.6330; 1,229.00 Italian lire, down from 1,232.75, and 1.2354
Canadian dollars, down from 1.23575.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.6555 West German marks, down from 1.6625; 1.3635 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3732; 5.6130 French francs, down from 5.6505;
1.8575 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8725; 1,229.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,235.50, and 1.2339 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2370.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery was bid at $454.40, down from Wednesday's late bid of
$457.80.
   But gold rose overseas. In London, gold finished at a late bid
price of $454.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's
$453.60. In Zurich gold closed at a bid $457.50, compared with
$454.50 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.02 to close at a bid $458.81.
   Silver fell on New York's Comex to $6.755 a troy ounce, down
from Wedneday's $6.757 an ounce. In London the metal traded at a
late bid price of $6.72 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's
$6.65.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply increased in late March, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The report, however, had no impact on interest rates in the
credit markets.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $9.4 billion to a
seasonally adjusted average of $2,976.5 billion in the week ended
March 21 from $2,967.1 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased $5.3 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,744.7 billion from $2,967.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose $6.3 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $766.7 billion from a revised $760.4
billion. For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $759 billion, a 3.1
percent increase from the prior 13 weeks.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In setting its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
M2 and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The Fed
has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $131 million in
the week ended March 23, compared with a decline of $48 million a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $220 million, down from $325 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $273.7 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $274.5 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Hog Contract Plunges The Limit In Pre-Report Sell-Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The contract for June delivery of live hogs plunged the
150-point limit for daily trading Thursday on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in a late sell-off ahead of an important
government report, analysts said.
   On other markets, in mostly thin trading ahead of the three-day
weekend, grains and soybeans were mixed; precious metals retreated;
energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Speculation that the Agriculture Department's quarterly 10-state
hogs and pigs report would prove bearish for the pork complex
sparked the late plunge in hog prices, analysts said.
   But when the report came out after the close, experts called it
neutral to bullish.
   The report showed the hog and pig count in states that account
for 80 percent of U.S. production at about 40.5 million head as of
March 1, a 6 percent increase over the same date a year ago.
   The average of analysts' pre-report estimates was a 5.9 percent
increase. The market had already adjusted to reflect the estimates,
so many analysts termed the report neutral for pork futures prices.
   But a breakdown of the report showed relatively small increases
of 3 percent for hogs weighing 60-119 pounds, and 4 percent for
hogs weighing 120-179 pounds.
   Those animals will be coming to market in April and May,
resulting in a smaller increase in slaughters than the market
experienced in March, said Tom O'Hare, an analyst in New York with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   The likely near-term outcome is slightly higher pork futures
prices, especially on contracts for delivery in the summer and
fall, O'Hare said.
   ``Initially, it may help the back months and the fronts may sit
still,'' he said. ``But as people realize that kills are not
picking up, I think it's going to help everything.''
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .58 cent lower with the April
contract at 74.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with March at 82.77 cents a pound; hogs were
1.50 cents lower to .17 cent higher with April at 45.52 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .42 cent lower to .50 cent higher
with May at 56.12 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade ahead of two eagerly awaited government reports.
   The Agriculture Department's annual report on spring planting
intentions and its quarterly report on grain stocks, both issued
after the close, were construed as very bullish for soybeans and
slightly bearish for corn and wheat.
   The plantings report, based on farmer surveys conducted in
March, predicted about a 1 percent increase in soybean acreage to
57.9 million acres. The number was well below the average
pre-report estimate of 59.1 million acres.
   Soybean stocks, estimated at nearly 1.15 billion bushels as of
March 1, were slightly below the average pre-report estimate.
   Because the markets will be closed Friday, they cannot react to
the reports until Monday. Analysts said they expected soybean
futures prices to climb sharply to encourage more farmers to plant
soybeans.
   During the next two weeks, ``I think we may go 30 to 60 cents
higher from (current) levels,'' said Cathy Leow, assistant vice
president of Thomson-McKinnon Securities Inc.
   The reports showed corn planting intentions at 66.9 million
acres, up 2 percent from last year but slightly below expectations.
That number was offset by the corn stocks estimate of 7.6 billion
bushels, slightly above pre-report estimates.
   Wheat plantings were estimated at about 65 million acres, down
very slightly from last year's total, while wheat stocks were
pegged at 1.9 billion bushels, down significantly from last year
but above expectations.
   In trading Thursday, wheat settled 3 cents lower to { cent
higher with May at $2.99\ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to { cent
higher with May at $2.09} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 3 cents
higher with May at $1.61{ a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 4{
cents higher with May at $6.53{ a bushel.
   Precious metal futures retreated slightly on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $3.40 lower across the board with April at $454.40
a troy ounce; silver was 0.2 cent to 1 cent lower with April at
$6.755 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil futures ended nearly unchanged while refined products
prices were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 1 cent
higher with May at $17.08 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to .45
cent lower with April at 48.15 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .15 cent lower to .02 cent higher with April at 48.67 cents a
gallon.

<HEAD>USDA Says Corn Plantings To Rise By 2 Percent This Spring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn farmers intend to increase plantings this
spring to 66.9 million acres, up 2 percent from 1987 but still one
of the smallest planted areas in 18 years, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said an annual
U.S. survey of more than 70,000 farmers in early March also showed
1988 planting increases for some other crops, including soybeans,
cotton, durum wheat, rice, peanuts, tobacco and sweet potatoes.
   Decreases were indicated for sorghum, barley, oats, winter
wheat, other spring wheat and dry edible beans.
   According to USDA records, if farmers follow through with
current plans, 1988 corn plantings would be the third-smallest
since fewer than 66.9 million acres were planted in 1970.
   Despite the increase from 1987, this year's plantings would fall
13 percent below the 76.7 million acres planted for the 1986 corn
harvest.
   The planted acreage dropped to 60.2 million acres in 1983, a
year of drought and massive government acreage cutbacks.
   Officials cautioned that the actual acreage planted by farmers
this spring ``may vary from intentions because of the effects of
weather, availability of production inputs, changes in market
conditions prior to planting'' and the impact of the USDA report
itself.
   Soybean plantings were indicated at 58 million acres, up 1
percent from last year but still the second lowest acreage since
1976.
   Total wheat plantings, which include winter wheat seeded last
fall for harvest this year, were shown at 65.1 million acres, down
1 percent from 1987.
   Winter wheat plants were reported at 48.6 million acres, down
0.4 percent from 1987, and ``other'' spring wheat was shown at 12.8
million acres, down 7 percent from last year. Durum wheat, at 3.73
million acres, was up 12 percent.
   Other crops surveyed included:
   _Cotton plantings, 11.6 million acres, up 11 percent from 1987.
   _Sorghum, 10.7 million acres, down 9 percent, the smallest
acreage in 57 years.
   _Barley, 10.3 million acres, down 7 percent.
   _Oats, 16.3 million acres, down 9 percent.
   _Rice, 2.8 million acres, up 19 percent.
   _Peanuts, 1.6 million acres, up 3 percent, the most since 1958.
   _Tobacco, 633,000 acres, up 5 percent.
   _Dry edible beans, 1.38 million acres, down 23 percent.
   _Sweet potatoes, 97,600 acres, up 1 percent.

   Bond prices finished narrowly mixed Thursday in
trading muted by anticipation of the three-day holiday weekend.
   The Treasury's closely-watched 30-year issue edged up [ point,
or about $1 for every $1,000 in face value, as its yield slipped to
8.75 percent from 8.76 percent late Wednesday.
   The credit markets are scheduled to be closed on Friday in
observance of Passover and Good Friday.
   Many traders were hesitant about taking a big position in the
fixed-income market in advance of Friday's scheduled release of
unemployment figures for March. With the U.S. markets closed, there
would be little chance to unwind those positions until Monday if
the numbers turned up a surprise.
   The bond market has been closely tracking fluctuations in the
dollar, and the dollar moved in a narrow range throughout the
session, closing near its opening levels. Bond prices initially
moved lower but later recovered.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged, intermediate maturities were mixed with
some off 1-32 point and others up 2-32 point and 20-year issues
fell 3-32 point, according to the financial information firm
Telerate Inc.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.06 to 111.64.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 0.28 to 281.04.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 5.72
percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills were unchanged at 6.04 percent and one-year bills
rose 1 basis point to 6.37 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6} percent, up from 6| percent late Wednesday.

   Stock prices pieced together some modest gains
in a quiet session Thursday amid what analysts described as an
atmosphere of caution heading into the long Easter-Passover weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.94 to 1,988.06,
finishing the week with a gain of 9.11 points. For the first
quarter of the year, the average chalked up a net gain of 49.23
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 824 up, 678 down and 479 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 139.87 million shares, down from 151.81
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index added
.38 to 146.60.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to carry big positions
through the weekend, especially with a Labor Department report due
out Friday on the employment situation for March.
   Both the stock and bond markets will be closed on Friday, and
thus will not have a chance to respond to any surprises in the
employment data until Monday.
   In the last monthly set of figures, a much
stronger-than-expected increase in nonfarm payroll employment dealt
the bond market a sharp setback.
   Brokers said money managers at investing institutions had pretty
much completed maneuvers to ready their portfolios for reports to
clients on their performance in the first quarter as of Thursday's
close.
   The market got something of a boost from a rally in the shares
of International Business Machines and Digital Equipment, two
widely followed stocks that have been slumping lately. IBM shares
climbed 2{ to 107| and Digital 1} to 104{.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &
Telegraph, up { at 27; Exxon, up \ at 42; American Express, up | at
24], and General Motors, up [ at 71].
   Atlantic Richfield rose 2{ to 84. The company said its
first-quarter earnings are expected to come in above $2 a share,
against $1.31 in the comparable period last year.
   Federated Department Stores gained 2| to 72| as the bidding
competition for the company between Campeau Corp. and R.H. Macy
continued.
   Minstar jumped 2] to 26\ in the over-the-counter market. The
company said it had received a proposal from its chairman, Irwin
Jacobs, to acquire it for $29 a share in cash and securities.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.20 billion, or 0.36
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 164.27 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.02 to 300.39,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.82 at 258.89.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 2.86 to 374.64. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 296.43, up 2.76.

<HEAD>Two Countries Prepare to Sign New Five-Year Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and the United States have reached
substantial agreement on a new five-year pact to expand their
scientific and technical cooperation, the State Department said
Thursday.
   The new agreement, to be concluded in about three months, seeks
incentives to boost the flow of American students, researchers and
scientific workers to Japan, said officials of both countries who
declined to be named. They said more than 10 times as many Japanese
are currently in U.S. classrooms, laboratories and factories as
Americans studying or working in Japan.
   The 1980 U.S.-Japanese scientific exchange agreement, extended
several times since its expiration in 1985, was extended for
another three months ``to allow for legal editing of the new
document, and signing at a high level,'' the department said.
   It will be considerably more detailed than the existing pact on
the two countries' scientific and technological relationship and
also provide a new management structure to oversee that
relationship, the State Department said.
   It will provide for protection of patents and other intellectual
property rights while calling for the widest dissemination of
information resulting from joint research, the announcement said.
   Both countries were concerned about the need to increase the
flow of Americans to Japan, said the sources. They said the new
agreement provides steps to be taken by both sides to make Japan
more attractive for U.S. scientists and easier for them to go
there. It envisions more funding for Japanese language study and
fellowships by the United States, one said.
   The estimate that there are 10 times as many Japanese students
and scientists currently in America as Americans in Japan is a
rough minimum estimate, because in the United States it is
difficult to count students of science separately from those of
other subjects or even from tourists, one official said.

<HEAD>Internal Bank Board Probe Finds `No Criminal Activity'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal agency that regulates savings
institutions said Thursday that an internal investigation has found
no criminal activity by a subsidiary agency that manages property
from bankrupt S&Ls.
   However, the report, by Federal Home Loan Bank Board Inspector
General Paul Gibbons, did reveal ``ineffective business practices''
by the Federal Asset Disposition Association.
   The investigation was requested in September by Rep. James
Florio, D-N.J., after a critic of FADA complained that he was being
investigated by a private detective.
   William T. Juliano, a Mount Laurel, N.J., developer who was
threatening a lawsuit against FADA, charged that the agency,
through its law firm, hired a detective agency to probe his
financial affairs.
   Juliano, according to Florio, reported that his office was
broken into on Sept. 14 and that eavesdropping equipment was found
in the ceiling.
   Gibbons, however, said New Jersey State Police had found no
evidence of wiretapping at Juliano's office and local police had
closed their break-in investigation for lack of evidence.
   Jon Shure, a spokesman for Florio, said the congressman had just
received the report and had not had a chance to review it.
   But, he added, ``We are still pursuing our own look into FADA.
It is still very much a live issue. Nothing would be in that report
that would make us say, `OK we're not interested in FADA anymore.'''
   Shure said there has been no result reported from a parallel
investigation of the charges by the Justice Department. He said
Florio has asked Congress' investigative arm, the General
Accounting Office, to review the bank board report.
   Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, said the report made no
judgment about the propriety of hiring a private detective agency,
whose investigators in questioning Juliano identified themselves as
representing a firm selling credit card.
   Hoyle said the detective agency was hired without the knowledge
of bank board officials and that the board subsequently directed
that no investigators be hired without its permission.
   The bank board report also found no evidence to support
allegations leveled by two others: Pasquale Verona, a Fort Myers,
Fla., real estate investor, and Joe R. Dobson, a Austin, Texas,
developer.
   Verona charged that FADA officials offered him a bribe, in the
form of a consulting fee, if he would back off from complaints he
made to members of Congress about the agency.
   Dobson, according to Florio, said his office was broken into and
ransacked after he told FADA officials he had secretly taped his
conversations with them.
   Members of Congress, real estate investors and others have
criticized FADA for being too sluggish in selling property from
bankrupt S&Ls, thus depriving the cash-short federal fund that
insures S&L deposits of money. They have said the agency is riddled
with conflicts of interest and wastes money.
   Among the poor business practices acknowledged by the bank board
report were failure to return telephone calls to investors
interested in buying property managed by FADA and poor
dissemination of bidding information.
   The House Banking Committee, meanwhile, has been preparing its
own, broader report on FADA, which according to an industry
newsletter is being held up by the committee chairman, Rep.
Ferdnand G. St Germain, D-R.I.
   The March 28 issue of Bank Letter cited unidentified sources who
said St Germain, in the wake of a federal court ruling that raised
questions about congressional immunity, feared the highly critical
report might draw a slander suit.
   Congressional sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the newsletter's account adding that Republicans on the
committee were blocking publication of the report in the
Congressional Record, which would be immune to a libel suit.
   Rick Maurano, an aide to St Germain, said the congressman was
unavailable Thursday evening to comment on the FADA investigation.
House Banking Committee aides did not return telephone calls on the
subject.

<HEAD>GE To Proceed Unopposed With Offer For Roper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. reached an agreement
Thursday with rival bidder Whirlpool Corp., allowing it to proceed
unopposed with a $507.6 million offer to acquire Roper Corp.
   GE spokesman George Jamison said the Connecticut-based company's
offer of $54 per share would be extended until 5 p.m. Monday.
   Whirlpool simultaneously announced it was terminating its
$50-per-share offer.
   The battle to acquire Roper, an appliance and lawn equipment
manufacturer based in Augusta, Ga., began last November. Earlier
Thursday, GE and Whirlpool said they were negotiating to resolve
their dispute over the proposed acquisition.
   ``For GE, the Roper factories and Roper's strong Sears
relationship makes this an important niche acquisition that will
significantly strengthen our appliance business in an increasingly
competitive global market,'' said Roger W. Schipke, GE senior vice
president in charge of the company's appliance business.
   Roper had recommended Tuesday that its shareholders accept GE's
latest tender offer, rather than the $470 million bid from
Whirlpool.
   Whirlpool and GE agreed Tuesday in Delaware Court of Chancery
that there would be no open market purchases of Roper stock until a
judge ruled on a GE request for a temporary restraining order.
   The companies said Thursday that agreement was being continued
while they negotiated, and eventually the two came to an accord.
   GE sought an order to prevent Whirlpool from making a ``street
sweep'' of Roper stock through market professionals rather than
from public shareholders. The reqest came in a hearing on a GE
application for a preliminary injunction to block a Whirlpool
acquisition of Roper.
   The terms of the agreement between GE and Whirlpool allow GE to
acquire Roper and its manufacturing capacity for kitchen ranges and
lawn equipment. Whirlpool, in return, will get rights to the Roper
name for major appliances. GE will supply Whirlpool with
Roper-brand electric and gas ranges at competitive prices for at
least two years, according to a press release from the companies.
   The parties also agreed to other commercial relationships
whereby GE would sell to Whirlpool certain industrial components
and materials.
   Lawsuits filed by both companies will be withdrawn upon
completion of GE's tender offer, the companies said.

   House and Senate negotiators reached tentative
agreement Thursday night on a sweeping trade bill designed to open
foreign markets, but only after loading it with provisions that
lawmakers said could invite a veto.
   Repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies, tough trade
sanctions against Toshiba Corp. of Japan and millions of dollars in
new subsidies designed to boost U.S. grain exports were tentatively
included.
   ``We're going to need a trade policy in the next couple of years
and I think this is as good as anything that's going to come across
the president's desk,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
   Rostenkowski and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, worked out the details of the central agreement
in private in the final hours of negotiations over different
versions of the bill passed last year by both houses.
   The measure erased a provision for driving down unwarranted
foreign trade surpluses that had been sponsored by erstwhile
Democratic presidential hopeful Richard A. Gephardt.
   ``The Senate version prevailed and I think that's unfortunate
and I'm against the bill,'' the Missouri congressman told reporters.
   Reagan administration veto threats hovered over the legislation,
and some members of the House-Senate conference committee were
disatisified with the bargain worked out between Bentsen and
Rostenkowski.
   ``My chairman has reached an agreement with Sen. Bentsen and has
laid it at the feet of the conferees with only a sort of very
general discussion and is now winging his way to Istanbul,'' said
Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn.
   He said that it was uncertain that Rostenkowski would be able to
sell the package to other House members of a House-Senate trade
conference committee.
   Reagan administration officials had been threatening a veto over
provisions requiring employers to provide workers with notice of
plant closings and the Toshiba sanctions.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said in a statement Thursday night
that the plant closing provision and another relating to foreign
investment ``clearly would sink the legislation unless they were
removed.''
   Thursday afternoon, however, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater appeared to back off a bit, saying that the
administration was not trying to signal a veto and still hoped to
receive a trade bill that it could sign.
   Rostenkowski told reporters before leaving on a congressional
fact-finding trip to Turkey that he hoped to get sufficient members
of the conference committee to sign the final product.
   ``When you get down to the serious negotiating, something has to
lose sometimes and I understand that the administration is
disappointed in some of this legislation,'' he said.
   Final arrangement began to fall into place Thursday morning when
one of 17 separate groups of conferees adopted the trade sanctions
against Toshiba and a subsidiary for selling computerized machinery
to the Soviets for the silencing of submarine propellers.
   The measure would ban U.S. government purchases of Toshiba
equipment for three years. It would bar import of products of the
Toshiba Machine Corp. subsidiary for three years. In the future,
such violations would be punishble by import bans of two to five
years.
   The House had held out for leaving retaliation up to the
president but Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, refused to accept that
proposal and won out in the end. Another group of conferees broke
up without taking action on a proposal by Rep. John Bryant,
D-Texas, to require registration of foreign property ownership in
the United States. They said they would wrap up the issue in one
final meeting after the spring break.
   Repeal of the windfall profits tax was a major goal of Bentsen,
who is running for reelection this year in a state hammered hard by
low oil prices.
   Congress approved the tax in 1979 to when oil prices were
soaring. But the collapse of OPEC sent them plunging in 1985 and
dried up revenues from the tax. Critics say they want repeal
because the tax means costly paperwork.
   Farm lawmakers, meeting separately, said they were close to
agreement on a provision that would put in place export subsidies
of up to $500 million in 1990 unless negotiators reach agreement by
then on phasing out agricultural subsidies under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The so-called triggered marketing loan would benefit producers
of wheat, feed grains, soybeans and other oilseed crops.
   Farm lawmakers also agreed on boosting by $1 billion the Export
Enhancement Program, which furnishes grain companies and others
with surplus government crops to induce them to ship American grain
overseas.
   Gephardt's plan would have required the U.S. trade
representative to roll back ``excess and unwarranted'' foreign
trade surpluses by 10 percent annualluy if negotiations failed to
do the job.
   In its place, Bentsen and Rostenkowski adopted a Senate proposal
that would require the trade representative to list foreign unfair
trade practices and if necessary take action to force trading
partners to end them.
   The agreement between the two also transferred authority to
impose retaliatory import curbs from the president to the U.S.
trade representative _ a step that the White House had vigorously
opposed and which Rostenkowski had sought. But it provided
authority to waive such retaliation if the cost ``would be
substantially out of proportion to the benefits of action.''
   The president would retain his authority to decide whether to
grant import relief to industries that were hard hit by surges in
imports.
