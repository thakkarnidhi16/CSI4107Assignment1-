   An explosion on an oil tanker docked at a
loading platform in the Long Island Sound Wednesday night knocked
several people into the water, authorities said, and at least one
person was missing.
   The blast shook the area and could be heard for miles around at
about 10 p.m.
   ``I've never experienced an earthquake but it must be something
like this,'' police Sgt. Anthony Iannone said. ``We've had several
residents report that their windows were blown out.''
   The Coast Guard was searching the water for a missing person,
Chief Warrant Officer Myron Verville said. He said he was unaware
of any injuries.
   The tanker, the Fiona, was unloading oil, which is then piped to
the Northport plant of the Long Island Lighting Co., said Gene
Geisinger of the Northport Fire Department.
   The platform is located about 2 miles north of the plant in the
Sound, he said.
   ``We have reports of people in the water and scuba divers are
out there trying to find them,'' Geisinger said.
   Geisinger and county police said the explosion did not start a
fire. But it could be felt more than 10 miles away, said Suffolk
County Police Officer Albert Droscoski.
   Ray Golden, a spokesman for the Long Island Lighting Co., said
he had received reports of the explosion but did not have details.

   The jury in the McMartin Pre-School
molestation trial may not hear about a romance between a social
worker who gathered evidence from children in the case and a
newscaster who covered the story, a judge ruled Wednesday.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders said the defense had not
shown that it was relevant to the trial.
   The defense had suggested that Wayne Satz, a former KABC
reporter, influenced the interviews that Kee MacFarlane conducted
with children from the preschool as part of her job at Children's
Institute International. The attorneys also argued that her
credibility might be damaged if jurors knew about the relationship.
   ``I don't see from what's been presented that there's a
substantial issue for the jury,'' Pounders said after hearing Ms.
MacFarlane testify about the relationship outside the presence of
the jury.
   Ms. MacFarlane, whose testimony in pretrial hearings concerned
her use of games and picture coloring to get children to talk of
the alleged abuse, told the judge that her romance with Satz began
after the interviews were completed.
   Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61,
are on trial on 100 molestation and conspiracy charges linked to
their now defunct McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. The case
has been in Los Angeles courts for five years.
   ``We're not trying to demonstrate that Wayne Satz obtained
information from Kee MacFarlane to enhance his career,'' said
defense attorney Dean Gits. ``What we're trying to show is that Kee
MacFarlane had a relationship with Wayne Satz to enhance her
career.''
   Ms. MacFarlane has denied being a source for Satz's stories
broadcast on KABC-TV on the McMartin case, although she
acknowledged Wednesday that they discussed it at the time.
   Satz, who is no longer with the television station, sat in the
courtroom while Ms. MacFarlane was questioned. But Pounders ruled
he was protected from testifying by California's news reporter
shield law.
   Pounders said that although ``the relationship has an impact on
the case,'' he would allow only general testimony about the affair
during Wednesday's hearing and no exploration of minute details,
which he said would be prejudicial and might violate Ms.
MacFarlane's privacy rights.
   He also limited testimony to late 1983 to March 1984, when Ms.
MacFarlane ended her interviews with children and indictments were
issued. He is previewing the testimony before jurors hear it.
   Ms. MacFarlane said they met when Satz came to interview her for
a general story on child molestations.
   In late 1983, before stories about the case broke, Ms.
MacFarlane said she received a phone message from Satz saying he
wanted to discuss Raymond Buckey, who would later become a
defendant.
   She said she turned to a co-worker, Sandra Krebbs, and said,
``My God, Sandy, he's gotten wind of the case.''
   ``He knew a lot of things about this case,'' she said. ``Some of
them were things I knew. Some were things I didn't know.''
   At another point she said, ``I remember being shocked at what
kind of information he had. It was startling to me. He seemed to
know everything.''
   ``Did you ever become boyfriend and girlfriend with Wayne
Satz?'' Gits asked Ms. MacFarlane.
   ``Yes,'' she answered after a brief pause.
   ``When, in your best estimation, did that happen?'' he asked.
   ``It was after March 1984,'' she said, but added she could not
be sure because ``relationships evolve over time.''
   Ms. MacFarlane did not say when the relationship ended. She has
since married someone else. Satz was fired by KABC-TV last year in
a dispute unrelated to the McMartin case.

<HEAD>Santana Strikes Chord in Musical Scene after Two Decades</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When jazz great Miles Davis recently
praised the originality of Carlos Santana, the low-key musician
expressed satisfaction that he still strikes a singular chord on
the musical scene after two decades.
   ``For Miles to tell me this, hey, that's a great compliment, but
it shows that I'm not on stagnant water,'' said Santana, who's
admired for his stirring guitar solos. ``Stagnant water stinks. You
need water to go out, you need water to come in _ all the time. And
in order to do it, you have to become a student. Once you have a
master's and you know everything, it's a drag.''
   To keep his music flowing, Santana will release a three-record
LP early next month and has launched a tour that reunites Gregg
Rolie, Jose ``Chepito'' Areas and Michael Shrieve, three original
members of the band that evolved during jam sessions in San
Francisco's heavily Hispanic Mission District.
   The Santana Blues Band made its debut in 1968 at the Fillmore
West where Santana recently held court at a small side table
overlooking busy Geary Street, talking about his new album, the
feelings behind his music and the popularity of Latin-rhythm groups.
   The Mexican-born Santana arrived in San Francisco in 1961,
entering the national spotlight with a show-stopping performance at
Woodstock in 1969. He has gone on to earn 14 gold albums, nine
platinum albums and sell more than 25 million records worldwide.
   Despite a pocketful of popular hits _ including ``Evil Ways,''
``Black Magic Woman,'' ``Oye Como Va,'' ``Soul Sacrifice'' and
``Europa'' _ the 41-year-old Santana has continued experimenting.
The new anthology, including some unreleased cuts, serves to ``give
a testimony of the things we have become and lived.''
   ``We're looking to take the music further. I mean, play the
music and respect it for the way you play it, but also embrace the
future and take some new chances,'' said the slender, mustachioed
Santana.
   ``We want to serve the people with our music,'' he said. ``Music
is a healing force if played correctly. I really believe that,
aside from being the universal language, it's a healing force and
reminds us that we have more things in common than we think.''
   For Santana, who began playing guitar at age 8, music has never
been a strictly commercial endeavor.
   ``Music is not to make a living,'' he said. ``Music is to help
the conditioning of life. People play for many different reasons
and all of them according to their heart's capacity. My capacity
tells me that I can do a great service by doing music correctly.
People know when you're playing something from your heart and when
you're just giving lip service.''
   Before Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine began doing
the ``Conga'' and Los Lobos started playing ``Tex-Mex,'' Santana
was infusing his music with the ``Latin rhythm.''
   In past cuts such as ``Samba Pa Ti,'' ``Oye Como Va'' and
``Black Magic Woman,'' Santana showcased ``salsa'' when it was
still considered something to add to Mexican dishes.
   Still, most of the recent publicity surrounding Hispanic-theme
movies _ ``La Bamba,'' ``Stand and Deliver'' and ``Milagro
Beanfield War'' _ and Latin-rhythm musical groups fail to even
mention Santana.
   ``For Gloria Estefan and Los Lobos and all the other
Spanish-speaking people today, if they want to go to the future,
they got to go through me first,'' Santana said.
   On the other hand, Santana expressed satisfaction his music has
not been easily categorized, and points out his innovative music
has endured for two decades.
   ``I consider myself a musician and a stylist, in bringing forth
a certain thing that all generations can relate to,'' he said.
``That's better for me than being something mega-everything for
three years.''
   The new album, titled ``Viva Santana!,'' is the latest of 25 LPs
released during his career. He also cut albums with Buddy Miles and
John McLaughlin.
   The tour began on Aug. 26 at Tacoma, Wash. Some scheduled stops
include St. Louis, Richmond, Va., New York, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas
and Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Tiber Lovers Try To Turn The Tide For Rome's Polluted River</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smelly sewage notwithstanding, the Tiber is having a
renaissance.
   Once the river was the lifeline of Rome. From ancient times to
just a century ago, Romans bathed, fished and washed their clothes
in it.
   Rome's unplanned development boom after World War II, however,
proved too much for the river. In 20 years, the population swelled
from 1 million to more than 3 million.
   Anyone foolish enough to swim in the Tiber risks fatal infection
from the untreated sewage that pours into it daily. Today's Romans
don't have the habit of going down to the river _ a stroll there
means sidestepping broken bottles, rats and syringes discarded by
drug addicts.
   But this summer gave Tiber lovers hope the tide is turning their
way in the battle against pollution and neglect.
   With an eye on developing tourist attractions for 1990, when
Rome hosts the World Cup soccer games, the city offered free boat
rides during July. The response was so great that the promotion was
extended into September.
   Tickets sold out for sunset cruises to the romantic setting of a
play performed at the Roman amphitheater at Ostia Antica, the
Tiber's ancient port.
   Hot, breezeless nights found young Romans playing cards and
dancing on Tiberina Island.
   ``The fish will return, there will be pleasure boats. This isn't
the Thames, but there's reason to believe the Tiber can be made
livable for flora and flauna,'' said Aurelio S. Misiti, a sanitary
engineer and professor at Rome's La Sapienza University. His
department works closely with the city on Tiber projects.
   While dictator Benito Mussolini had declared the river
contaminated and banned swimming and transport in 1924, Misiti
noted, postwar governments didn't get around to prohibiting the
dumping of sewage into it until 1976.
   ``In 1974, Rome started building the first purification plant,''
Misiti said in an interview. ``Now there are four plants, but they
can only handle a bit less than half the discharge, and that's just
talking about urban waste, not industry's, which is supposed to be
handled by the factories themselves.'' The sewage treatment program
was supposed to have been completed years ago.
   Misiti said it should be finished by 1992 and ``after that the
Tiber should return to normal.''
   Just outside the city, fisherman pull in edible catch from the
river, which begins its 251-mile course in the Etruscan Apennines.
   Paola Ruggeri of the World Wildlife Fund says the city for the
most part doesn't enforce regulations forcing factories to purify
their wastes before spilling them into the Tiber.
   Since 1982, her group has rented from the city a stretch of
riverbank and intends to keep it as a green oasis.
   Willows, poplars, even a fig tree, lean out to the water, making
that stretch look more like Mark Twain's Mississippi than a river
channeled through a noisy, traffic-plagued international city.
   ``Every week volunteers come to clean it and every week we find
a mountain of garbage,'' Ms. Ruggeri said.
   Until about a century ago, the city spilled down to the river
banks, leaving Rome vulnerable to devastating floods, roughly every
couple of hundred years.
   After many suggestions, including those of Giuseppe Garibaldi,
the unification hero, the government began walling off the Tiber
and demolishing buildings at river-level. Now pedestrians and cars
move along, at bridge-deck level, with the Tiber's murky green
waters are out of sight below.
   Earlier this year, when the city planned its annual April 21
celebrations of the legendary founding of Rome by Romulus along the
left bank of the Tiber, it hosted an exhibit about excavations done
in the last 10 years, when the river became a distinct department
within the city's Superintendency of Archaeology.
   Tourists walking along the river can see the excavation of a
three-level storehouse for jars of oil, wine and fish sauce left
dockside by barges at the ancient port near what is now Testaccio,
a blue-collar workers' neighborhood.
   ``In the past, the city lived on its river. Rome was a kind of
Venice, a Copenhagen, a London or a Paris,'' said Claudio
Mocchegiani Carpano, head of the city's underwater archaeology
department.
   ``A thousand years from now, when they dig up artifacts from the
20th century, they'll find out that the Tiber just ran through Rome
and served as a sewer,'' Carpano said.

   In the narrow and crowded lanes of the
old bazaar, a 25-inch-tall man sits in a store selling candy and
hoping to find a wife.
   ``It is a hard life to be a dwarf, and to be the world's
shortest living matured man is even harder,'' Gul Mohammad said in
his whispery voice as he counted coins and handed sweets to
children much taller than he.
   Mohammad is 3.3 inches shorter than the shortest living adult
listed by the 1988 Guinness Book of Records, Nelson de la Rosa of
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
   ``No one noticed me before, until a local newspaper reporter had
a chance meeting with a friend of mine, who told her about me,''
Mohammad, 32, said in an interview Tuesday.
   He is the eldest of four children of Noor Mohammad and Fatma
Begum.
   ``My first issue were twins, Gul and Zahoor. Both were
dwarfs,''' Fatma said in her one-room home in the Ballimaran
district of Old Delhi. ``Zahoor died after four years, but Gul
lived to become a man.''
   Her other children, a boy and a girl, grew to normal size.
   Gul, which means flower in the Urdu language, is lonely and
wants to get married. He was 10 when his father died. His mother
soon remarried, and Gul was sent to live with his maternal uncle,
where he stays today.
   ``I want to marry someone who is of normal height so that she
can carry me around, feed me and give me bath. ... I do not want to
live on the charity of my relatives forever,'' he said.
   His arms are so short that his hands ``can't reach his head
while bathing,'' said his aunt, Nargis Begum.
   Mohammad started his candy business with an investment of about
$35, but he has been robbed twice.
   ``I could not do anything. I have decided when I marry I will
ask my wife to sit with me in the candy store,'' he said with a
broad smile.
   Mohammad, whose only vice is smoking, giggles constantly.
   ``I used to get very upset when people laughed at me, but I
figured out if I laughed back that fixes them,'' he said.
   ``Being the shortest man is not a joke. It is a hard
existence,'' Mohammad said.
   Walking is difficult for Mohammad, who pays about 30 cents a day
to teen-agers who piggyback him where he wants to go.
   ``I can't get onto a rickshaw or sit on a bicycle. It is
difficult to balance,'' he said.
   Mohammad's neighbors are fond of him. ``He is our pride. When he
becomes world-famous, we will all be very, very happy,'' said
Ashraf Rizvi, a travel agent who brought Mohammad to the attention
of the National Herald newspaper.
   Mohammad's uncle, Manzoor Hussain, said a circus once tried to
buy him. ``I would have gladly agreed to let Mohammad work in the
circus but to lose him forever is something impossible.''
   He said the circus offered the equivalent of $14,285 for
Mohammad, a staggering amount in India where the per capita annual
income is $290.
   Hussain hopes Mohammad will find a bride.
   ``But who will marry him? Maybe one day when he is famous
someone will come and offer him her hand,'' the uncle said. ``But
the problem is that Mohammad wants a normal-height women, not a
dwarf like him.''

   A burned and terrified German
girl, not yet in her teens, asked of the American soldiers holding
her, ``Am I going to die? Am I going to die?''
   ``I just can't get that face out of my mind,'' one of them said
later.
   A young airman said God helped him save injured people after the
crash Sunday at the Ramstein air show. A woman told of the anguish
she felt when her husband was assigned to retrieve the remains of
victims.
   The unofficial U.S. military newspaper Stars and Stripes
published an account Tuesday of moving stories told at ``grief
clinic'' that was closed to other news media. City Editor Betty
Luman said a reporter from the newspaper attended the clinic on the
condition that the participants not be identified.
   ``One of the tech sergeants from my squadron was holding a 10-to
12-year-old German girl,'' a soldier said. ``She was burned, but I
couldn't tell how bad.
   ``She just kept looking at me asking `Am I going to die? Am I
going to die?' And I couldn't tell her one way or the other, so I
just kept looking at her and saying: `You're all right. You'll be
fine.' And she kept screaming for her mom. And I just can't get
that face out of my mind.''
   A 21-year-old airman said: ``I was actually putting my hands
inside their backs and sides to keep their veins shut. I think God
put my feeling aside so that I could get in there and help.''
   Tears welled in a woman's eyes as she told of her husband's
assignment to collect the remains.
   ``I knew he had to talk about it,'' she said. ``I didn't want to
talk about it, but I knew I had to. I'm here for me, but I'm here
for him, too.''
   1st Lt. Alan Sattler, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Base at
Ramstein, told The Associated Press the general news media were not
invited to the session Monday because, ``after all, this was aimed
at healing the people involved.'' Stars and Stripes said the
meeting of eight survivors with mental health experts was the first
of several the Air Force is sponsoring to help people deal with the
tragedy.
   Its report said: ``Survivors spoke of experiencing depression,
lack of sleep, loss of appetite, decreasing interest in things they
usually do, guilt and recurring visions. And they cried.''

   Women's groups and other organizations
are demanding compulsory AIDS tests for the thousands of foreigners
who will visit South Korea for the Olympics.
   The groups contend the influx of visitors could spread acquired
immune deficiency syndrome in a nation that has reported just a few
AIDS cases and enacted tough laws to curb the spread of the disease.
   ``It must be compulsory for all foreign visitors during the
Olympic period to show medical certificates confirming they are
free from the disease,'' said So Mi-yong of the Women's Hot Line.
   The government, worried about offending foreigners, has said
there will be no mandatory AIDS tests. Health officials say it
would be impossible to test the 200,000 expected visitors.
   Health authorities have reported two AIDS deaths and about 30
cases of the AIDS virus, mainly among prostitutes, since the first
case was reported in South Korea in 1985.
   But Olympics authorities and government officials are adopting a
number of measures to try to ensure the Games do not expose the
nation to AIDS any more than is necessary.
   Seoul residents have been receiving handbills headlined ``AIDS''
and warning people that they must take every precaution to avoid
the disease.
   ``It is a horrible disease that cannot be stopped by any method
except preventative measures,'' the leaflet warns.
   City health officials said the warning was being distributed on
the eve of the Olympics to raise public awareness before the
visitors arrive. Leaflets are being sent to all households in the
city of 10 million people.
   The pamphlet makes no reference to the Olympics, but it does say
the first diagnosed case discovered in South Korea was an American.
It also stresses the high number of AIDS cases overseas.
   Free condoms will be distributed at the Olympic Athletes Village
that will house 13,000 athletes and officials, officials said.
Officials did not know if condoms would be provided to the 6,000
journalists in the Press Village.
   Health authorities and police will watch the city's prostitutes
during the Olympics to make sure they have been tested for AIDS as
required by law, officials say.
   ``We will be taking special measures during the Olympics,'' said
Dr. Lee Sung-woo, director general of the Bureau of Public Health.
   Seoul officials also have conducted a public education campaign
in recent months to alert the public to AIDS. Posters have been put
up in subways and other places.
   But some civic groups and opposition lawmakers say the measures
are not enough. They contend the only certain defense against the
disease is to require all foreigners to prove they are not infected
with AIDS.
   National Assemblyman Park Sil called for mandatory testing of
all foreigners coming to the Olympics. ``There is no guarantee they
won't bring this deadly disease,'' he said.
   Women's groups say it is unfair to test prostitutes and not
foreigners who may infect them. Civic groups formed a council to
press for mandatory testing.
   ``It is ridiculous to require AIDS tests only on hostesses with
frequent contacts with foreigners,'' said Ms. So of the Women's Hot
Line.
   Tough laws were enacted this year to limit the spread of AIDS.
The law allows authorities to monitor and regulate people infected
with AIDS or the AIDS virus.
   Under the law, people with AIDS who have intercourse without
using protection such as condoms face up to three years in prison,
officials have the power to isolate AIDS sufferers, and doctors who
fail to report cases face jail terms.
   Most South Koreans see AIDS as a ``foreign'' disease and insist
their nation can be spared if controls are imposed on foreigners.
The government has rejected demands for mandatory AIDS tests for
foreigners for fear of offending other nations and discouraging
business and tourism.
   Health officials admit it is only a matter of time before AIDS
spreads in South Korea and testing of foreigners would do little to
stop the disease. The government hopes its public campaigns will do
more to limit its spread.

   The white-led government has
released the names of 801 people held without charge for at least
30 days under state-of-emergency regulations. The great majority
are black.
   The list, released Tuesday, includes many prominent
anti-apartheid activists who have been held for most or all of the
state of emergency declared on June 12, 1986.
   Among them are Zwalakhe Sisulu, editor of the black-oriented
newspaper New Nation, and Murphy Morobe, chief spokesman for the
now-banned United Democratic Front coalition.
   Virtually all the detainees on the list are black, but among
them are a handful of whites. The only white held for the entire
emergency is Raymond Suttner, a law lecturer at the University of
the Witwatersrand.
   The government is not required to report the names of detainess
held less than 30 days and has never issued comprehensive figures
for the number of detentions during the emergency.
   Monitoring groups estimate that 30,000 people have been held for
varying periods.

   A mother said she asked the court for
leniency on behalf of the drunken driver who killed her son because
the 21-year-old former soldier deserved the chance to change his
ways.
   Jefferson Circuit Judge Ellen Ewing granted Margaret Smith's
request and ordered Richard Brinkley to serve 90 days in jail.
Ewing suspended the rest of a five-year prison term and placed him
on five years' probation.
   Ms. Smith said it had been hard to accept the loss of her
25-year-old son, Patrick, in such an accident.
   ``I feel like the most important thing in my life has been taken
away from me,'' she told the judge Monday. ``Every time I go by ...
I'll be reminded of where my son died, and that hurts very much.
   ``But I feel like Mr. Brinkley is very young, too, and he should
have the chance to maybe change his ways.''
   Brinkley, of Decatur, Ark., had been charged with second-degree
manslaughter. But in July he pleaded guilty to the reduced charge
of reckless homicide as part of an agreement with Assistant
Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine.
   The accident occurred Dec. 12 as Brinkley was driving the wrong
direction in the westbound lanes of the Gene Snyder Freeway.
Brinkley's pickup collided with Smith's car, and Smith died at the
scene of multiple injuries.
   A test showed Brinkley's blood-alcohol level was 0.14 percent,
above the state's 0.1 percent at which a person is presumed
intoxicated.
   At the urging of Smith's mother, Wine had recommended that
Brinkley be placed on probation so he could give public talks about
the dangers of drunken driving.
   Brinkley, who had been stationed at Fort Knox, was discharged
from the Army this month, primarily because of the accident, said
defense attorney Doug Miller.

   Camp owners on Little Cobbossee Lake
discovered a new island, and it floats as the wind shifts.
   ``It's pretty wild to see,'' Tom Gordon, of the Cobbossee
Watershed District, said Tuesday. ``You can have a stretch of beach
one day and the next day have wetland.''
   The island, covered with cattails, grass and wild rice, is
apparently a chunk of wetland that broke off from the mainland and
floated out into the lake, Gordon said.
   ``It is a real inconvenience for property owners,'' Gordon said.
   One resident, Paul Kendall, said he thought he could push the
island, with help from other boaters, to shore in a less bothersome
area. There, he said, it would have to be tied down to prevent it
from floating back out.
   But Kendall also had another idea for getting rid of the island.
   ``Hey,'' he asked a visitor, ``you want some land?''

   Eight passengers and two crew members were
injured Tuesday when a USAir jet, traveling from Pittsburgh to Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., encountered severe turbulence over South
Carolina, officials said.
   The plane made an unscheduled stop in Savannah, where the
injured were taken to Memorial Medical Center for treatment, mostly
of bruises and scrapes. One passenger, an unidentified pregnant
woman, was admitted for overnight observation, said Dave Shipley, a
spokesman for USAir in Washington.
   About 100 other passengers on the flight were put on other
planes to continue their travel, Shipley said. The National
Transportation Safety Board will investigate, he added.
   Shipley said the pilot of the Boeing 737-300 was passing some
thunderstorms when a sudden jolt hit the plane 30 miles south of
Columbia, S.C.
   ``There were thunderstorms in the area and none of them were
painted (reflected) on his radar,'' Shipley said. ``He was
maneuvering around them visually when it hit.''

   A grass and brush fire raged out of
control Tuesday afternoon, quickly destroyed five expensive homes
and badly damaged two others.
   The blaze was controlled about two hours after it began in this
rural community about 20 miles east of San Francisco, said Fire
Capt. Greg Holm.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   Orinda Police Chief John Dashnor said police and fire
investigators are canvassing the area to check out second-hand
reports that a teen-ager was seen shortly before the fire carrying
a bottle rocket, a homemade fireworks device.
   Several people reported hearing sounds like firecrackers minutes
before the blaze broke out, said Holm.
   ``We are investigating it as a suspicious fire, but the cause
has not been determined,'' he added.
   Five houses, each worth about $1 million, were destroyed and two
others had an undetermined amount of damage, said Fire Chief Ed
Lucas.
   Many residents were not at home when the fire broke out. The
flames rapidly spread through the dry brush and tree-covered hills,
destroying several houses in just minutes. About 10 acres were
burned, said firefighter Marty O'Connell.
   Beverly Hopp, whose 33-year-old home was destroyed in the blaze,
said several children helped her rescue her four dogs from the
flames. The only property she and husband, Al, were able to save
was a desk containing money and insurance papers.
   ``This has been the worst time of my life,'' she said ``What do
you do after all these years?''
   Nancy Artist, a homeowner and 18-year resident, said the fire
came within yards of her home.
   ``The hills are steep, and when the wind comes up, it makes
those hills like chimneys with flames just coming right up them,''
Artist said.
   Shifting winds, gusting up to 22 mph, made it difficult for
firefighters to contain the blaze. The fire shifted directions
several times because of the winds, officials said.
   ``One time it's going down the hills, then seconds later it's
going up the hills faster than it came down,'' Artist said.
   Lynne Cechettini, 16, was napping when her sister woke her up
and told her about the fire.
   ``I looked out the kitchen and there was this huge flame wall
and I thought for sure our house was gone,'' said Cechettini, whose
hair was filled with ashes. Only the roof of the Cechettini's home
burned.
   The homes were situated among grassland dotted by patches of
California scrub oaks, pine and eucalyptus trees and low-lying
bushes.

<HEAD>U.S. Style Marriage and Divorce Criticized by Americans, Japanese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese attitudes toward marriage, divorce
and the family are changing but the American model is an
unattractive one, young adults from both countries said at a
cultural exchange.
   Thirty university students from Japan and 30 from the United
States, ranging in age from 17 to 25, compared cultural and social
traditions at a gathering that produced strong criticism from both
sides of the high U.S. divorce rate.
   The United States in 1985 had five divorces and 10.2 marriages
per 1,000 people. Comparable Japanese figures were 1.39 divorces
and 6.2 marriages per 1,000.
   ``Americans seem so crazy about kids, but when they divorce
aren't they forgetting about the children?'' said Tadakatsu Tsuruno
of Tokyo at the daylong session last week in Washington
co-sponsored by Nihon Keizai, a Japanese economic newspaper, and
Konica, the photographic and electronics company. The Japanese,
from 11 universities, were winners of an essay contest on the two
countries' roles in the world. The Americans were engaged in
Japanese or other foreign studies at U.S. universities.
   University of Maryland student Scott Larson said the high U.S.
divorce rate ``is a sign of how individualism has gone out of
control'' in the United States. He called it ``individualism with
no altruism.''
   But despite their criticism of U.S. trends, Tsuruno and other
Japanese said things also are changing at home.
   ``The Japanese attitude to marriage is approaching the American
way ... with people thinking more for themselves,'' Tsuruno noted.
``We still have arranged marriages, but 99 percent of my generation
will find wives by themselves.''
   Noriko Takahashi, a Tokyo University medical student, said she
will make the final decision on her future husband although she
will consult with her parents.
   She said that if someone simply wants romance, ``you can have it
without marriage. But the reason for marriage is to have children
and propagate generation after generation'' of the family.
   Laura Pochop of Brown University said Japan's divorce rate is
likely to rise as Japanese women acquire the ability to support
themselves. Without it, she said, many Japanese wives are forced to
accept their husbands' liaisons with other women, ``a situation
American women would find intolerable.''
   A moderator, Prof. Martin Weinstein of the University of
Illinois and Washington's Center for Strategic and International
Studies, said Japan's divorce rate is rising, with more older women
divorcing after raising their children to adulthood.

<HEAD>Judge Says HUD Must Consider Homeless When Selling Foreclosed
Houses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development must consider the needs of the homeless before the
agency auctions off government-owned, foreclosed homes to the
highest bidder, a federal judge says.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene temporarily barred HUD on
Tuesday from selling 170 single-family homes in the metropolitan
Washington area. The sale was scheduled for today.
   Last week, another federal judge in Washington blocked HUD from
selling 200 foreclosed homes in Michigan.
   The actions are part of a broader effort to force the federal
government to make some of HUD's inventory of 47,000 foreclosed
houses available to the homeless.
   Greene, in issuing his temporary restraining order, said HUD had
violated federal laws by refusing to make a survey of its stock of
buildings and properties and determine which might be transferred
to non-profit groups that provide services for the homeless.
   He also said HUD has not complied with the law which calls for
``the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home
and a suitable living environment for every American family.''
   ``HUD cannot just sell to the highest bidder,'' he said. ``The
government cannot not just consider the amount of revenue coming
in.''
   Greene said his temporary restraining order would last until
Sept. 14 while Judge Oliver Gasch, who has jurisdiction over the
case, schedules further action.
   HUD is acquiring foreclosed properties at a rate of about 7,000
each month. Because it has been selling between 6,000 and 7,000 of
the properties monthly, the agency has accumulated a ``rolling
inventory'' of about 47,000 homes, the largest backlog in its
history.
   The surge in HUD's stock of properties reflects a rash of
foreclosures on properties in the oil-producing states, and an
increase in the overall volume of homes insured by HUD in the wake
of lower interest rates two years ago.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Polish Developments Test US-Soviet Relations</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-Soviet relations were in a whirlwind of
confusion even before Polish workers staged their latest occupation
strikes.
   The United States is engaged in the always disorienting process
of choosing a new president.
   And the Soviet Union is emerging from a tumultuous Communist
Party conference filled with boisterous calls for economic reform
and greater democratization.
   ``Not only is it a period of great flux, but as far as the
Soviet Union is concerned, it is in the most fluid state since the
(1917 Russian) revolution,'' said Madeleine Albright, the chief
foreign policy adviser to Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis. Ms. Albright, born in Czechoslovakia, is an expert on
East-West relations and a professor at Georgetown University.
   The latest Polish upheaval poses, loud and clear, one of the
unanswered questions about the reform program of Kremlin leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev: How much political power are communist
authorities willing to hand over to their people in return for a
popular commitment to invigorate the economy?
   The wrong answer from Moscow or Warsaw to that question will
present the next American president with a dilemma.
   ``The problem that the next president is going to have to decide
is whether to continue to demand perfection from the Soviet bloc,
or whether to just declare victory and accept any change for the
better. And there is no question that things are getting better,''
said Jerry Hough, a Soviet expert at Duke University.
   ``It seems that everybody is holding his breath,'' said Charles
Fairbanks of the Johns Hopkins center for advanced international
studies. ``There is a marked movement toward detente, but no one is
sure how much momentum it has.''
   A new explosion of violence in Poland could delay or derail the
train.
   Two weeks ago Polish workers, with their backs to the economic
wall, began a second wave of occupation strikes this year,
demanding that the government recognize and negotiate with the
banned Solidarity trade union.
   The strikes forced Polish leaders to meet today with
Solidarity's leader, Lech Walesa, with whom they had vowed not to
negotiate since releasing him from martial law internment in 1982.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has introduced reforms
which, like Gorbachev's program, loosen central controls and allow
a greater role for market forces. But the Polish reforms have not
stimulated the economy: production remains sluggish and the foreign
debt has risen to $40 billion.
   The government's decision to meet with Walesa could be a major
step on the road toward a healthier Poland.
   Gorbachev has been silent on the Polish predicament, but he said
in Yugoslavia earlier this year that there were many paths to
socialism. Many people interpreted that to mean the Soviets would
not force Polish communists to smash a resurgent Solidarity, as
they did in the military crackdown of December 1981.
   The head of the largest U.S. trade union, AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland, last week urged the Reagan administration to invoke
provisions of the new trade bill calling for sanctions against
nations that violate workers' rights.
   Poland's communist authorities ``should be denied access to the
American market under those provisions since they are in violation
of worker rights,'' Kirkland said.
   Poland is desperately trying to break into Western markets and
to secure credits from the United States and the International
Monetary Fund.
   The Reagan administration has lifted most of the sanctions it
imposed against Poland and is in no hurry to slap them back on just
as U.S.-Soviet relations are improving. But new credits are out of
the question until Poland stabilizes its political situation.
   The administration, says State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley, hopes Polish communist authorities can find the path to
``national reconciliation.''
   ``Free labor unions can help the Polish economic reform effort,
not hinder it,`` Mrs. Oakley says. ``Indeed, it is hard to see how
economic reform can succeed without the participation of free trade
unions.''
   Another State Department official said ``we've been telling the
Polish government very consistently that their ability to reform
the economy and our ability to support that process will depend on
national reconciliation''; in other words, give Solidarity a slice
of the political pie.
   ``That's not ideology, that's practicality. No one is going to
accept the kind of austerity needed for economic reform without
making sure they get political reforms first,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   This is one area in which the Reagan administration and the
would-be Dukakis administration are pretty close, Albright says.
Last week, the Dukakis campaign urged Poland to legalize Solidarity.

<HEAD>Soviets Focusing on Futuristic Submarine Force</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is committed to a highly
advanced, nuclear-powered submarine force even though the Kremlin
faces the same type of funding woes confronting the Pentagon,
according to a new blueprint for the Russian navy now being studied
in the West.
   The blueprint is a book blessed by Fleet Adm. Sergei Gorshkov,
known as the ``father'' of the modern Russian navy. It envisions
submarines that can travel at 50 knots to 60 knots underwater ``in
the near term'' and ultimately up to 100 knots, while diving to
depths of 6,600 feet and carrying thermal-and laser-homing
torpedoes that can travel at 300 knots.
   The book, ``The Navy: Its Role, Prospects for Development and
Employment,'' was published in Moscow earlier this year and is now
being translated and analyzed by the U.S. Office of Naval
Intelligence.
   That office already has prepared a three-page summary, however,
that concludes the book ``in its scope is the most powerful Soviet
monograph on the navy since Gorshkov's `Sea Power of the State' (in
1976) and is clearly intended to demonstrate why the Soviet navy
must continue the Gorshkov legacy of fielding a high-technology,
high-seas navy despite evident fiscal constraints.''
   The book apparently was authored by several individuals but was
edited and carries a foreword by Gorshkov, for three decades the
driving force behind the Soviet navy.
   According to the Navy intelligence office, the book ``offers the
West an insight into the future composition and employment of the
Soviet navy,'' highlighting ``three key naval missions.''
   They include hunting and destroying U.S. and other Western
submarines before they could launch their missiles in a war;
destroying Western military and economic targets through nuclear
strikes from Soviet submarines; ``and destroying hostile naval
forces to gain command of the sea around the Eurasian periphery.''
   Throughout the book, special attention is given to
anti-submarine warfare and the threat posed by American subs, the
summary continued.
   ``The authors project a highly dynamic undersea warfare
environment with goals of 2,000-meter (6,600 feet) diving depths;
high-speed submarines, 50 to 60 knots in the near term and 100
knots in the out-years; future high-speed torpedoes, 200 to 300
knots, with thermal and laser homing; 50-kilometer (30-mile)
anti-submarine warfare missiles; and improved acoustic and
non-acoustic submarine sensors.''
   A knot is equal to 1.15 miles per hour, meaning the submarines
ultimately envisioned by the Soviets would be able to travel 115
mph.
   The Soviet Union already has the fastest nuclear-powered
submarines in the world; its Alfa and Akula attack subs can exceed
40 knots underwater. The U.S. Navy in the past has deliberately
eschewed the goal of building faster submarines, preferring instead
to emphasize quiet operation.
   As for the ``strike mission'' of attacking Western targets with
submarines, the book makes ``specific reference to `covert launches
from short ranges against targets and areas covered by anti-missile
defense systems' in order to decrease reaction time and increase
missile survivability,'' the summary said.
   ``Such comments highlight the potential importance of recent
Soviet sea-launched ballistic missile launches to test short-range,
short time-of-flight trajectories.''
   The book appears to be ``the Soviet navy's first salvo in
staking out its future role in Soviet national security policy
under the newly proclaimed defensive doctrine and `reasonable
sufficiency' philosophy,'' the American analysts added.
   Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev and top Soviet defense
officials have insisted to U.S. officials in recent months that
they are shifting their military orientation from an offensive to a
defensive stance and intend to maintain only a force that is
sufficiently large for protection.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has pressed the Soviets for
more details of their plans in several high-level meetings while
expressing doubts the Soviets are really changing their
offensive-minded doctrine.
   The new book reflects the current Soviet emphasis on defense by
devoting ``considerable attention ... to the defensive roles of the
Soviet navy,'' the summary said.
   The book says, though, that ``naval force composition is likely
to continue to emphasize nuclear submarines both for defensive
anti-submarine warfare missions and strategic nuclear strike.''

<HEAD>Striking Mom Reaches Settlement With Kids After 42 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took 42 days to settle their labor
dispute, but Gretchen Schulte, Kenosha's striking mom, has put down
her picket signs and signed a negotiated contract with her children.
   ``It was 100 percent worth it,'' she said. ``I don't even care
about the publicity and criticism. Even that was worth it. All that
matters is here in this house. And I think we've all learned
something.''
   ``It's great to be free,'' daughter Heidi said Tuesday, as she
relished the lifting of her grounding restrictions.
   Schulte went on strike July 18 to protest what she said was
disrespect and disobedience by her four children, 14-year-old twins
Eric and Julie; Heidi, 13; and Jerry, 8.
   She hung picket signs and nixed such duties as cooking,
cleaning, chauffering and laundering. A possible turning point came
recently when she refused to pay for her children's school clothes.
   Final negotiations Sunday lasted from noon until 6:40 p.m. when
the detailed contracts were signed.
   ``It was very emotional, traumatic,'' said Schulte, 42. ``There
was a lot of crying and screaming.''
   The family had to take a break when debate became too heated,
but the talks resumed after Schulte's husband, Theodore, cooked
dinner and family members cooled off.
   Even before the pact was signed, the children were outside
celebrating.
   ``Before I finished writing my name, they were jumping around at
the street corner, yelling, `It's over! It's over!''' the mother
said with a smile.
   ``Yesterday was the best day of my life and I plan to have
another one today,'' Eric said Tuesday.
   But in case anyone gets complacent, the contracts are taped on
the walls as reminders.
   Schulte no longer tells the children what needs to be done but
simply has them review their contracts.
   The handwritten documents contain specific instructions for
practically every chore and privilege.
   For example, the ``rec room'' contract states that parents will
provide a recreation room, and all radios, newspaper delivery bags,
shoes and jackets will be kept there.
   It also calls for removal of all cans, bottles and wrappers from
the room by 6 p.m. and specifies that failure to obey is punishable
by loss of television privileges for one week.
   The contracts, 11 of them in all, fill a notebook.
   Schulte had no regrets about the strike and insisted she would
have kept the children grounded and out of school if they had not
shaped up.
   ``But I knew they would come around,'' she said. ``I knew I had
the hammer.''

<HEAD>Farm Prices up in August but Trend Moderating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm commodity prices as a group were still
going up last month, although a new Agriculture Department report
shows that some major items were starting to level off in August.
   The department's overall price index rose 2.1 percent from July,
averaging 13 percent more than in August 1987. Also, the new
figures released on Tuesday showed that the index rose only 2.9
percent in July instead of the preliminary reading of 3.6 percent
announced a month ago.
   Since April, as drought cut into this year's harvest prospects,
farm commodity prices overall have climbed 10.8 percent. However,
there were some indications in the August report that the upward
spiral began to weaken.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that higher prices for cattle, apples, tomatoes
and lettuce contributed most to the August increase, while prices
declined for cotton, corn, onions and soybeans.
   In the earlier months, corn and soybeans helped lead the way for
rising prices. However, by late July, widespread rains began to
dampen further increases, although the drought of 1988 has not been
broken by any means.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade on Tuesday grain and soybean
futures closed sharply higher, but it was on the strength of new
export business, not further crop losses due to drought, analysts
said.
   Moreover, they said, the corn and soybean crops have passed
their most critical stages of development.
   Based on Aug. 1 estimates, this year's corn harvest may drop 37
percent from 1987; wheat, 13 percent; and soybeans 23 percent.
   ``All feed grain and soybean prices declined from July, but
rough (unmilled) rice and all wheat prices increased slightly,''
the report said. ``Average prices of beef cattle and calves
increased sharply from July but were below the high levels recorded
during February through May of this year.''
   Prices of some major commodities are based on mid-month averages
and then are revised the following month when additional
information is available.
   As a commodity group, prices of feed grains and hay dropped 2.8
percent from July to August, but still averaged 68 percent above a
year ago, the report said.
   Prices of meat animals rose 4.3 percent as a group but averaged
0.6 percent below the year-earlier mark. Beef cattle prices
averaged $66.40 per 100 pounds of liveweight, up $3.20 from July.
Hog prices increased $1 from July to $46.80 in August.
   Apple prices at the farm level, rose to 26.1 cents per pound in
August from 19.7 cents in July and 16 cents a year ago. Lettuce was
reported at $12.20 per 100 pounds, up from $7.62 in July but far
below the $18 of last year. Tomatoes, at $41.70 per 100 pounds,
were up from $31 in July and $17.30 in August 1987.
   Overall, the August all-crops price index was up 2.3 percent
from July, averaging 33 percent above the year-ago level.
   The August price index for all livestock and livestock products
was up 3.4 percent from July and averaged 1.3 percent more than a
year earlier. Higher prices for cattle, hogs, milk, turkeys and
eggs accounted for the increase from July.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
Before the drought took hold, USDA was predicting a 1988 food price
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
   Department officials have predicted that the drought may add 2
percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected
increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That
could mean a 1989 food price increase in the range of 6 percent to
7 percent.
   Tuesday's report said:
   _Cattle averaged $66.40 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $63.20 in July and $61.90 reported for August
1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $45.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $44.10 in
July and $58.60 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.66 a bushel, was down from $2.72 in July and the
average of $1.47 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.56 per bushel, compared with $3.50 in July and $2.36 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.61 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.51 in July
and $3.74 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $8.40 per bushel, compared with $8.50 in July and
$5.02 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 55.2 cents per pound, compared
with 58.6 in July and 63.7 cents in August 1987.
   _Eggs were 59.9 cents per dozen, compared with 62.2 cents in
July and 51.9 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $11.60 per 100 pounds, compared with $11.40 in July
and $12.20 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 41.9 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
42.1 cents in July and 31.7 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>Government Can't Claim Cross Is `Non-Religious,' Judge Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge Christian cross is an inappropriate
government war memorial at a Marine base in Hawaii, according to a
federal judge who says a non-religious monument would be more
suitable.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled Tuesday that the
65-foot wooden cross that is lit each night at Camp H.M. Smith in
the Honolulu suburbs on Oahu must be removed or replaced by a
secular symbol.
   The judge said the cross amounts to an unconstitutional
endorsement of religion by the government. The cross was challenged
by the Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A.
   ``The needless use of means that are inherently religious makes
a message of endorsement likely if not unavoidable,'' the judge
wrote in his opinion.
   ``The 65-foot lighted cross on Bordelon Field at Camp Smith may
fairly be considered to convey a message of governmental
endorsement of Christianity,'' Hogan said. ``The use of a cross as
a memorial to fallen or missing servicemen is a use of what to some
is a religious symbol where a non-religious one likely would have
done as well.''
   The judge stayed his order for 60 days to give the Reagan
administration, the Navy and the Marine Corps an opportunity to
seek another stay from an appellate court while they appeal his
decision.
   The Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A. contended in its lawsuit
that the wooden cross on a prominent point at the Marine base
violated the Constitution's ban on governmental endorsement of a
particular religion.
   The government argued during a hearing in May that the cross,
erected 22 years ago, served purely a secular purpose of honoring
Marines killed in the Vietnam war or are missing in action.
   But the Jewish veterans' group argued that the cross cannot be
considered a secular object because it is the ``symbol of the
passion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.''
   The government did not deny the religious significance of the
cross, but said ``the history of the memorial is clear; it was
erected as a secular monument.''
   Hogan, however, noted evidence that the original cross was built
in April 1966 for Easter sunrise services and that it was rebuilt,
after a fire, in time to be lit at Christmas 1983.
   ``Unfortunately, the government's choice of the principal and
universally recognized symbol of Christianity to achieve a secular
goal cannot withstand scrutiny in this instance,'' Hogan said.
   ``The principal symbol of Christianity, this nation's dominant
religion, simply is too laden with religious meaning to be
appropriate for a government memorial assertedly free of any
religious message.''

   Delays in getting the space shuttle back into
operation have led NASA to postpone its most ambitious scientific
mission, the launch of the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said Tuesday
that by moving the telescope launch from June 1 next year to Feb.
1, 1990, it can stay on schedule for launching three major
scientific probes that are dependent on planets being in favorable
position.
   Those launches are: Magellan, which will map the planet Venus,
in April 1989; Galileo, a U.S.-German project to survey Jupiter and
its moons, scheduled October 1989; and Ulysses, a cooperative
project with the European Space Agency, in October 1990.
   The first space shuttle flight since the Challenger exploded in
January 1986 has been postponed five times. NASA said it won't set
a new date until after a flight readiness review on Sept. 13-14,
but that it hopes to make the flight late next month or in early
October.
   The space telescope is in storage, but is costing the space
agency $7 million a month to keep it in working order. In space,
the telescope is expected to be able to look at objects 14 billion
light years away _ almost to the beginning of the universe.
   Ground-based observatories, which must look through Earth's
atmospheric veil, can only see light that originated about 2
billion light years ago.

<HEAD>Officials Claim Success in Drug Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities say a 30-nation narcotics
crackdown resulted in more than 1,200 arrests in the past month and
should lead to further drug busts in this hemisphere.
   ``Some operations are still going on,'' Charles Gutensohn, head
of cocaine investigations at the Drug Enforcement Administration,
said Tuesday.
   Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh and a host of other U.S.
and foreign officials said Tuesday that 30 countries had
participated in a series of anti-drug trafficking operations this
month, primarily in South and Central America.
   Thornburgh said authorities seized 11 tons of cocaine and
destroyed 244 tons of marijuana, 118,000 coca plants and 13 cocaine
laboratories. Authorities also demolished seven hidden airstrips
and seized $3.8 million in cash, he said.
   While Thornburgh said the effort did not represent victory in
the war against drugs, he said the ``cooperative nature'' of the
operations represented a new avenue in stamping out trafficking.
   ``Heretofore, each of the nations of the Americas has been
pursuing the war on drugs in a more or less unilateral or bilateral
fashion,'' he said.
   The participating countries, all members of the International
Drug Enforcement Conference, shared resources and intelligence and,
in a few cases, staged cross-border operations.
   Thornburgh said the United States did not orchestrate the drug
busts, though it did serve as a clearinghouse for data. Instead,
each country planned and executed its drug operations, often in
concert with other countries.
   ``By doing it all over at once, you disrupt the operation,''
Gutensohn said.
   Since many drug traffickers ignore national boundaries, it is
vital to close in on traffickers on many fronts, he said.
   In Peru, for instance, military authorities seized cocaine
laboratories in the Upper Huallaga Valley that are used by members
of the powerful Medellin and Calli drug cartels, based in Colombia.
Cocaine labs also were seized in Colombia itself, as well as
Bolivia.
   Among some other actions cited by the officials:
   _About 100 National Guardsmen in Arizona, Florida and Texas
helped border patrol officials inspect vehicles that crossed into
the United States.
   _As a result of information developed abroad, New York officials
seized two tons of cocaine and about $2 million in cash.
   _Military officers from Colombia and Venezuela operated along
the joint border.
   _Officials in Panama and Costa Rica worked together to seize
chemicals used for cocaine at points along the border. Panama
participated in the operation as a member of the conference, but
did not receive any ``centralized intelligence'' from the United
States, Thornburgh said.
   Panama's military dictator, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, has
been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on charges of
drug trafficking and money laundering. Washington has sought his
ouster since early this year, applying economic sanctions that have
hurt Panama's economy.
   _European nations and Canada stepped up monitoring of vessels,
cargo and aircraft arriving from South America.

<HEAD>Nixon Was Reluctant To Tape White House Sessions, Former Aide Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Nixon's former top aide says the 37th
president not only was reluctant to install an extensive taping
system in the White House, but that he quickly lost awareness that
his every conversation was being recorded.
   ``The historiography of the Nixon administration will eventually
be much the richer as a result of Richard Nixon's decision to
tape-record his meetings and telephone conversations,'' writes H.R.
Haldeman, Nixon's onetime chief of staff. ``Nixon was not thinking
of historians when he made this decision, but they will be the
ultimate beneficiaries.''
   Haldeman discusses the origin of the taping system, which
provided the evidence that eventually drove Nixon from office in
the Watergate scandal, in the summer issue of Prologue, the
quarterly publication of the National Archives.
   Haldeman's latest account is much softer in tone and less
critical of Nixon than when he described the same events in a 1978
book, ``The Ends of Power.''
   ``It is amazing to me when I think back to the first days, weeks
and months of the taping system's existence how quickly I forgot
about it,'' Haldeman writes. ``For a short time, I worried that it
might not be working, and I dispatched someone to test the
machinery. But the worry quickly passed, as did any awareness at
all that Nixon's conversations _ my conversations, often _ were
being taped. I think Nixon lost his awareness of the system even
more quickly than I did.''
   That dovetails with Nixon's own memory that ``initially I was
conscious of the taping, but before long I accepted it as part of
the surroundings.''
   Haldeman says his book 10 years ago focused on the Watergate
scandal that drove Nixon from office in 1974 and that, ``It was
unfortunately sensational in many instances where I would have
preferred it to be more reasoned and thorough.''
   Nixon fired Haldeman in April 1973 at the height of the coverup
of the break-in at Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate
complex in Washington. Haldeman served an 18-month prison term for
his part in the affair. In the book he said Nixon had ``fudged''
the tape story in various ways, ``climaxing with the assertion on
television in 1977 that he had ordered me to destroy all of the
tapes.'' There is no reference to that in the Prologue article.
   The former aide said he chose to write about the taping system
because the archives next year will release 60 hours of the
recordings for public listening.
   ``Nixon abhorred the idea of taping the president's meetings and
telephone conversations,'' Haldeman writes. He said he and Nixon
discovered the taping system of his predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson,
on inauguration day and that the new president ordered it removed.
   The major reason for the system, Haldeman says now as before,
was Nixon's failed attempt to halt inaccurate reports that came out
of his meetings with various people. Other reasons, he said, were
that Nixon wanted records for his memoirs and an accurate account
of what foreign leaders said to him.
   ``Something had to be done, both Nixon and I agreed, to ensure
that we possessed an accurate record of what was said in
meetings,'' Haldeman writes. They had tried using note-takers but
quit because they inhibited conversations, and they had tried
debriefing visitors as they left the Oval Office.
   In late 1970 or early 1971, Haldeman recalls, word got to Nixon
that Johnson felt he was foolish for not keeping a record of what
was going on and that such a record was necessary for memoirs.
   ``Nixon suddenly was receptive to the idea of taping his
meetings,'' Haldeman says. ``Finally, still reluctantly, Nixon
agreed that taping was the best way.''

   Some state and local Democratic leaders say
that while Michael Dukakis' Republican rivals have made their grab
for the national spotlight, his campaign has been making important
organizational gains in the field.
   Around the country, Dukakis field leaders and Democratic Party
state and local leaders contend the appearance of flagging momentum
on the part of the Dukakis campaign is at worst a temporary problem
_ a part of the ups and downs of a campaign that will balance in
the end.
   Dukakis campaign officials have said they were devoting much of
their summer efforts to building organization in the states, and
party officials in some key states point to organizational gains.
   ``Now is the time for quiet organizational activity that doesn't
get much publicity but pays off at the end,'' said Lanny J. Davis,
Democratic national committeeman from Maryland. ``Dukakis has put
together perhaps the best field organization ever put together by a
presidential candidate. None of that gets headlines, but you'll see
evidence of it in the fall.''
   In Ohio, a critical industrial state, party spokeswoman Carol
Rowan said the party has hired 15 field coordinators to work with
the Dukakis campaign. ``We are getting everything into place in the
grass roots, and that's where this election will be won,'' she said.
   Iowa state House Speaker Don Avenson said a Dukakis organization
has been built in regional areas of the state far earlier than in
previous Democratic campaigns. Party chairman Bonnie Campbell said
there are 12 Dukakis field workers and six administrators in this
important Midwestern farm state that has gone Republican in recent
years.
   ``We're seeing organizational work developing very, very early
in a campaign,'' Avenson said. ``Compared to recent years, it's
unprecedented.''
   In Minnesota, a good state for Dukakis, the campaign has opened
15 state offices, compared with one for Republican George Bush,
according to Dukakis campaign director Pat Forciea.
   But in South Carolina, a difficult state for Dukakis, state
campaign director Det Bowers said, ``We're operating almost totally
on volunteers.''
   In New York, Erie County Democratic chairman Joseph Crangle
acknowledged some ``sluggishness'' in the Dukakis campaign in
recent weeks and said the problem has been discussed at local
organizational meetings. He said some Dukakis supporters may have
become overconfident in view of Dukakis's lead in the polls after
the Democratic convention.
   That lead vanished in the glare of attention on Bush and the GOP
convention in New Orleans. The focus on the Republican ticket was
prolonged after the convention because of the controversial
selection of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as vice presidential
nominee.
   In Missouri, a battleground state for the fall campaign, party
executive director Todd Patterson said ``the Quayle mess'' had
drawn publicity to the Republican ticket _ and that it had hurt
Dukakis, even though much of the attention was critical.
   ``Right now, they've cut Dukakis off at the knees in terms of
publicity,'' Patterson said. ``I believe in my heart that Dukakis
will eventually win Missouri, but I think we have to get back on
track.''
   Dukakis himself voiced frustration on Monday that he has been
unable to draw attention to his economic themes because of the
attention on Quayle and on Bush's attacks on him.
   ``The Dukakis campaign has lost some of its early momentum,''
said Richard Lodge, chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee
in Tennessee. ``I think George Bush has controlled the debate, but
he has done it through the traditional Republican trick of
distorting Governor Dukakis's record.''
   Dukakis sought to take the offensive Tuesday, aggressively
attacking Bush on crime, defense spending and his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``I don't think Democrats have been pushing forward as
aggressively and quickly as the Republicans,'' said Patterson, the
Missouri Democrat. ``The Republicans have been forced to move
quickly because they've had to stir the dust up so voters won't see
where they're at in the road.''
   Some state Democrats dismissed talk of the campaign stalling, or
said it's so early it doesn't matter.
   ``The campaign is won in the last two weeks, not the first two
weeks,'' Alabama party chairman John Baker said.

<HEAD>Boos Follow Quayle On Campaign Trail, But They're For the Press</HEAD>

   There are plenty of boos on the campaign trail
with Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle, but they're
not for the candidate. They're for the press entourage traveling
with him.
   The press is generally seen by pro-Quayle audiences as the skunk
at the picnic as he makes his way around the country, because of
reporters' questions about the National Guard, his academic record,
his resume and various other personal details Quayle has called
``side events.''
   ``Let him alone!'' the audience shouts as reporters try to
waylay the vice presidential nominee. Some of the shouts are less
polite.
   Signs like ``Media Beware,'' ``Cut Sam Donaldson's Tongue Out''
and ``Press Go Home'' greet the traveling press.
   Last week, on Quayle's seven-state trip, at almost every stop
were identical signs with the word ``Press'' encircled in red and
with a red slash mark through the word, leading some to suspect an
organized effort.
   At a stop in Columbia, Mo., one unidentified teen-ager held such
a sign and told reporters, ``Someone gave it to me when I came in
the door and I liked it.''
   David Prosperi, Quayle's spokesman, said he had no idea where
the signs came from.
   ``I'm quite confident that it is nobody affiliated with the
Bush-Quayle organization in any way, shape or form,'' he said.
``That's just not the way we do business.''
   Prosperi said Quayle does not intend to ``have a fight with the
press.''
   ``We're here to have a fight with the other guys on the
issues,'' he said.
   Quayle was asked Sunday as he flew home whether he felt at times
as if he were running against the news media, instead of the
Democrats.
   ``I'm running with George Bush,'' he replied.
   Quayle won't say whether he thinks the press is out to get him,
telling reporters ``only you can answer that question.'' But he
says he does not disagree with his wife, Marilyn, who last week
said she felt the press was biased against Quayle because he was a
conservative.
   But Quayle has made it clear he dislikes the intensive media
scrutiny that has followed him since he became Bush's running mate
and allegations surfaced that he pulled strings to get into the
National Guard during the Vietnam War and into law school after an
average performance in college.
   At the California State Fair in Sacramento, Quayle petted a
Labrador retriever guide dog and when the dog just lay there with
his eyes rolled up, Quayle said, ``Now I know how it feels to be
hounded.''
   He tends to make sarcastic references to the press in his stump
speech, often referring to ``my newfound friends in the news
media'' or ``my cheering section.''
   The references are not lost on the audiences. At one appearance
in West Carrollton, Ohio, reporters who tried to ask Quayle about
the National Guard issue as he made his way shaking hands were
dealt with roughly.
   A large woman hit one female reporter's arm and shoulder and
turned and dealt another one a hefty body block. She said the two
women were endangering a group of Scouts.
   ``I'm just trying to protect the children,'' she shouted.
   The hostility reached its peak at a rally in Quayle's hometown
of Huntington, Ind., as he and Bush campaigned together on their
first day after the Republican convention. At a news conference
that was piped to the crowd over the public address system, the
crowd cheered Quayle's answers and booed reporters' questions.
   ``B-o-r-i-n-g,'' they shouted.
   On Tuesday, Quayle couldn't resist another reference to the
press, when he spoke to the International Association of Fire
Chiefs. ``I feel that I am very accustomed to fighting fires these
last couple of weeks.''
   When he was presented with a fire chief's hat, Quayle said:
``This is going to be prominently displayed on my airplane ...
right in front of where the press is sitting.''
   The hat will join another memento. At a California stop last
week, Quayle's aides quickly grabbed up a bumper sticker which
stated: ``I Don't Love the Liberal Media.''
   It is affixed it to the cabin door that faces the press section
of the aircraft.

<TEXT>
   The Emmys show was fledgling Fox Broadcasting
Co.'s highest-rated ever even though it was the second lowest-rated
Emmys presentations, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures.
   ``The 40th Annual Emmy Awards'' broadcast Sunday ranked 33rd
among network shows with a rating of 10.4 and an 18 share, Fox's
highest showing among the networks.
   NBC won the night with ``Police Academy 2: First Assignment.''
Fox also trailed CBS' ``Blood and Orchids, Part 1,'' but that
didn't faze Fox President Jamie Kellner.
   ``I'm very pleased to be the No. 3 network nationally,'' he
said. ``I also think that we put a great show on.
   ``It's the first time we've ever over-delivered for advertisers,
so it was good for them, too,'' Kellner said. He said Fox had
guaranteed a 10.0 rating. Last year's Emmys was the lowest-rated
ever with an 8.8 its first of three years on Fox. When NBC carried
the Emmys in 1986, it got a rating of 23.7 and a 36 share.
   Otherwise, it was a week of reruns with NBC's ``The Cosby Show''
back in first place.
   The rest of the top 10 included NBC's ``A Different World,''
``Cheers'' and ``Night Court,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder,
She Wrote,'' NBC's ``Police Academy 2,'' ``Golden Girls,'' ``Amen''
and ``Hunter.''
   NBC won the week that ended Sunday with an average, prime-time
rating of 12.2. CBS had a 9.7 and ABC had 8.9. But the
three-network share of 56 percent was a rebound from the all-time
low 47 during the week of the Republican National Convention.
   Each rating point represents the antion's 886,000 households
with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   In the evening news race, ``ABC World News Tonight'' pulled into
the lead with a 9.3 rating and 20 share. The ``CBS Evening News''
was second with a 9.0 and 20. ``NBC Nightly News'' remained in
third with an 8.6 and 18 share.

   Actress Julianne Phillips, looking to give
``The Boss'' the boot from their 3-year-old marriage, has claimed
``irreconcilable differences'' with rock superstar Bruce
Springsteen.
   Miss Phillips' one-page divorce petition filed Tuesday in Los
Angeles Superior Court seeks unspecified spousal support and says
property rights will be determined later, said her attorney, Arlene
Colman-Schwimmer.
   The Springsteens maintain a home in the area, Ms.
Colman-Schwimmer said.
   ``Starting the divorce is simple. It's the complications that
arise later that are the problems,'' she said.
   A spokesman for the singer could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   Springsteen, known as ``The Boss,'' has recorded such rock hits
as ``Born To Run,'' ``Thunder Road'' and ``Tunnel of Love,'' which
was dedicated to Miss Phillips.
   The couple, who met backstage at one of Springsteen's concerts,
were married May 13, 1985, in Miss Phillips' hometown of Lake
Oswego, Ore.
   They have no children, and a spokeswoman for Springsteen, 38,
has previously denied reports he and Miss Phillips, 28, separated
over the issue of starting a family.

   He no longer looks much like a ``splinter,'' but
to many of his fans baseball batting great Ted Williams is still
splendid at 70.
   ``He's a kid forever as far as I'm concerned,'' said Ed Stack,
president of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. ``Ted's
very much a young person. He's never going to be old; he's that
type of guy.''
   Williams, dubbed the ``Splendid Splinter'' when he played for
the Boston Red Sox at a lean 165 pounds, had some extra weight on
his frame as he celebrated his 70th birthday Tuesday, but the image
of major league baseball's last .400-season hitter was still fresh
in fans' minds.
   Williams, who retired in 1960, still shows up at Red Sox spring
training camp in Winter Haven, Fla., sharing his hitting philosophy
with players who heard about the legend of ``Teddy Ballgame'' from
their fathers.
   ``My dad talked about him a lot,'' said Red Sox outfielder Mike
Greenwell, a leading hitter in the American League this season.
``He was big when my dad was growing up.''

   A TV cameraman suffered a cut to his head when
Houston Rockets star Akeem Olajuwon grabbed his equipment after
being questioned about a lawsuit filed against him by his former
girlfriend, a reporter said.
   The former girlfriend, Lita Spencer, claims the 6-11 National
Basketball Association center deserted her because he wanted a
taller woman to bear his sons.
   KHOU-TV reporter Mark Watts said he and cameraman Jim Shipley
had gone to Olajuwon's house Tuesday to get comment about the
lawsuit.
   ``He started shouting at us and told us to get away,'' Watts
said, adding that the two started to leave the house.
   But Olajuwon ran after the cameraman and grabbed his video
equipment, causing it to hit Shipley's forehead, Watts said.
Shipley was treated and released at a hospital without needing
stitches.
   In her lawsuit filed Friday in federal court, Ms. Spencer asks
for $9 million in damages on grounds that Olajuwon refused to marry
her after she became pregnant in an attempt to prove to him that
she could bear children.
   Ms. Spencer, a petite, University of Houston law school student,
contends Olajuwon left her for ``a taller woman who is more likely
to bear tall sons worthy of his genetic heritage.'' The suit says
Olajuwon breached a contract when he backed out of his promise to
marry Ms. Spencer.
   ``When basketball season starts, I will have something to say,''
Olajuwon said. ``Until then, I have no comment.''

   New Jersey gaming regulators have
thrown a roadblock in the way of entertainer Merv Griffin, who has
won approval to buy Resorts International Inc. from developer
Donald Trump.
   Griffin's proposed trust agreement _ needed before he can buy
the Resorts stock from Trump, the controlling stockholder, and
Class A shareholders _ failed to win approval Tuesday from the
state Casino Control Commission.
   The trust agreement is necessary in case the commission finds
Griffin ineligible for a New Jersey gaming license. In that case,
the trust would run the company until Griffin could appeal the
decision or sell off the company's assets.
   The commission voted 3-2 against the proposed trust agreement,
largely because it calls for a trustee to take control of The
Griffin Co. rather than just the Resorts stock.
   Griffin officials wanted the trust agreement to cover The
Griffin Co. to ensure the firm is able to take advantage of prior
tax losses of Resorts, potentially worth $100 million.
   The former talk show host, however, said he still expects the
deal to go through.

   Despite strong objections from the
prosecutor, a judge sentenced a cocaine dealer to stage benefit
rock n' roll concerts for juvenile drug treatment programs rather
than a prison term.
   The Santa Clara County prosecutor who tried the case had asked
the judge for a six-year sentence for 26-year-old Dan Nelson, a San
Jose concert promoter.
   ``This is a better deal for society,'' said Nelson, whom a jury
in April found guilty of offering cocaine for sale, possessing the
drug for sale and being armed during the undercover narcotics
transaction that incriminated him.
   Agents testified he carried a briefcase with 17 ounces of
cocaine and a loaded handgun.
   The sentence was handed down last week by Superior Court Judge
Paul R. Teilh. Nelson could avoid spending even a night in prison,
but must donate 1,820 hours of community service work and pay a
$5,000 fine.
   Nelson, who has no previous record, also was sentenced to a year
in the county jail, but would be allowed to work during the day and
spend his evenings at home with an electronic monitor clamped to
his ankle.
   ``I'm upset and very, very disappointed,'' said Deputy District
Attorney Margaret Dufreschou. ``We're trying to make a real
deterrent against drug sales, and I don't think this helps.
   ``Getting arrested and going to prison are part of the cost of
doing business for drug dealers. What this does is lower their cost
of doing business,'' she said.
   However, Vince Schiraldi of the National Center on Institutions
and Alternatives in San Francisco called the judge's sentence
``courageous and wise.''
   ``We're punishing the guy and getting a very needed community
service at the same time. There are winners all the way around.''

   The unidentified owner retrieved the smaller lizard Sunday. But

   Acting Police Chief Robert T. Burger said Tuesday that workers

located near a marsh, where it is feeding on rodents.
   The owner is a student who police won't identify because he is

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa left for
Warsaw on Wednesday for his first talks with Polish authorities
since Solidarity was banned. The government hoped the meeting would
end two weeks of labor unrest.
   Asked what he would discuss with Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak during the talks, Walesa said: ``How to make up for the
past seven years.'' Solidarity was crushed in a 1981 military
crackdown.
   Walesa traveled by car with senior Solidarity adviser Tadeusz
Mazowiecki.
   The meeting Walesa's advisers said would be held Wednesday would
follow four days of maneuvering started by Kiszczak's proposal on
Friday that officials and worker representatives hold
``round-table'' discussions.
   A communique from the Communist Party's ruling Politburo,
distributed by the official news agency PAP, mentioned a
round-table meeting, endorsed it and said Kiszczak should ``carry
on with the mission entrusted to him.''
   It was not clear, however, whether the reference was to the
Wednesday meeting or the minister's original proposal on Friday. No
other official reference was made to Walesa-Kiszczak talks.
   Ten enterprises in Poland remained on strike. At its height, the
current labor trouble involved 20 sites employing 100,000 people
and was the worst since 1980.
   Solidarity spokesmen said there was no agreement for an
immediate end to the strikes, in which a central demand has been
making Solidarity legal again. Mazowiecki called the decision for
talks ``a historic moment.''
   Walesa last met with the government on behalf of the union in
late 1981.
   On Tuesday evening, Walesa left the strikebound Lenin shipyard,
where he works as an electrician, to confer with advisers and
Bishop Tadeusz Goclowski at nearby St. Brygida's church. He emerged
from the rectory with the bishop later to cheers and chants from
supporters.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said earlier in the day that
talks could begin as soon as Walesa called off the strike at the
Lenin shipyard, where the Soviet bloc's first free union was born
in the labor uprising of 1980, but aide Piotr Konopka said: ``For
the present, the strike is still on.''
   He said Walesa would attend the Wednesday meeting as president
of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity, the labor
federation's full name.
   While the government expressed its willingness to talk, strikers
at the Stalowa Wola steel mill in southeastern Poland said soldiers
had moved into the town and helicopters flew over the plant.
   Workers are occupying the shipyard and steel mill, as is
customary during strikes in Poland.
   In a reference to the Stalowa Wola strike, Kiszczak's ministry
and the armed forces general staff issued a statement saying: ``In
case of the continuation of the illegal strike action, appropriate
lawful measures will be taken.''
   Adam Michnik, a historian and senior Walesa adviser, said
Tuesday night: ``The talks begin exactly on the anniversary of the
August agreements'' that created Solidarity as a legal union in
1980.
   ``We want to believe that a new chance begins and it will be at
a time when Poles can make use of this chance,'' he said. ``The
results of this meeting tomorrow will be very important for the
fate of the country and the world.''
   Mazowiecki said: ``We hope that this meeting will serve the
purpose of dialogue and agreement and the most important issue,
which is trade union pluralism and the legalization of Solidarity.''
   Urban told his weekly news conference Tuesday: ``The stoppage of
strikes by Mr. Lech Walesa and the shipyard where he works would
mean automatically convening a round table.''
   He said no rules had been made for the agenda of the
``round-table'' talks with representatives of various segments of
society, to be moderated by Kiszczak, who suggested them last
Friday.
   ``We are ready for talks ... with all those who respect the law,
a significant symptom of which is avoiding participation in illegal
srikes and moreover contributing to their stoppage,'' Urban said.
   Walesa had said he would not call off the Lenin shipyard strike
unless Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's government promised to include
trade union pluralism in the discussion and he was allowed to take
part as the recognized leader of Solidarity.
   He traditionally marks the Aug. 31 date of the signing of the
Gdansk agreements by laying a wreath at a monument to workers
killed in labor unrest during 1970. It is near the Lenin shipyard's
main gate.
   Michnik said earlier that Urban's statement represented only a
``preliminary step'' because it ``does not say exactly what can be
understood by the term round table, who would sit at it, and the
subject of the talks.''
   Most strikers have demanded higher pay and better working
conditions in addition to legalization of Solidarity, but the
status of the outlawed union is the only demand at Stalowa Wola.
Piotr Niemczyk, a Solidarity spokesman in Warsaw, said the workers
had authoritized Walesa to negotiate for them.

<TEXT>
   Anxious to rid itself of the hordes of
skunks roaming streets, yards, buildings and gardens, the city has
put out a contract on the malodorous animals.
   Panguitch officials say the town's 1,400 residents have had it
up to their noses, prompting authorities to offer a $5-a-skunk
reward to encourage the trapping and destruction of the animals.
   ``It's a whole stinking problem,'' quipped City Manager Bruce
Fullmer. ``This is a farming community, and the skunks come out of
the fields and into the community once in a while.''
   Fullmer said that in the past, this southwestern Utah town
contracted with resident Van Barney _ ``a pretty good man for
handling skunks'' _ to get rid of the animals, but he died last
year.
   The reward is aimed at enticing two animal control officers to
take up the task, he said.
   Officials won't turn down residents who find a skunk or two
under a shed or an old house. But officials aren't trying to
encourage residents to go out and gather skins and then turn them
in for the reward, Fullmer said.

<TEXT>
   Seemingly unaffected, buffalo roam the
parched South Dakota prairie on America's largest bison ranch while
crops wither and domestic livestock suffer and even die because of
the drought.
   ``Nature sure gave them about everything it takes to survive ...
except the bullet,'' said Roy Houck, who with his late wife,
Nellie, started the Houck Buffalo Ranch nearly three decades ago.
   The hardy bison, native to North America, were hunted to near
extinction in the late 1800s for its skins and meat.
   Houck's buffalo forage on brown grass and linger near water
holes. The ranch has more than 200 ponds, all of which have been
drawn down by the drought, and some are almost dry.
   Depending on the season, 3,000 to 4,500 buffalo inhabit the
50,000-acre ranch that's fenced into 35 pastures.
   After the various herds are allowed to graze in one pasture for
a few weeks, the gate to the next pasture is opened, and the huge
beasts move into the area to resume foraging.
   ``The main breeding herd, we don't feed them anything but
grass,'' said the 83-year-old Houck. ``We try to supplement the
calves a little the first year to give them a boost.''
   Although the drought seems not to have affected the herd, its
impact may show up next spring in a smaller calf crop, Houck said,
explaining that this is the mating season.
   ``These cows won't conceive if they're not in good shape,''
Houck said, glancing over at the rummaging animals about 30 yards
away. ``But so far these cows look pretty good. They're holding
their meat pretty well.''
   The ranch hasn't had a decent rain in more than a year, and
100-plus-degree temperatures have been common all summer.
   But the drought of 1988 is no match yet for the Dust Bowl days
of the 1930s, Houck said.
   ``The dry dust storms of the '30s still haunt me,'' he said.
``It was so dry in the spring of 1934 the grass never even
sprouted.''
   Not that Houck isn't concerned now.
   ``If we're forced into another year of drought, we'll probably
have to graze our pastures a lot longer than we'd like to,'' he
said. ``After going through those dry '30s, you wonder how long
it's going to last.
   ``We've got to be pretty cautious because you can't just load
buffalo on a truck and take them to the sale barn.''
   Buffalo enjoy their freedom, and are handled as little as
possible.
   ``When you get them in confinement, they've only got one thought
in mind and that's to get away,'' Houck said. ``If you happen to be
in the way, that's too bad.''
   Horses once were used to round up the buffalo. Four-wheel drive
trucks are now used.
   ``Buffaloes don't seem to like horses'' and besides can outrun
them, Houck said. One of his sons once ``got his horse knocked
right out from under him'' by an angry buffalo.
   When buffaloes are 2 years old, they are sorted for bulls and
heifers. Most bulls go to slaughter and heifers are kept for
breeding.
   Between 800 and 1,000 are butchered on the ranch each year,
Houck said.
   The market for buffalo meat, which is very low in fat, has been
good, Houck said. ``Right now, we're getting $2 a pound for dressed
buffalo meat.''
   Once an endangered species, buffalo have made a remarkable
comeback, said Mary Duvall, executive director of the National
Buffalo Association. Buffalo numbers are estimated at between
75,000 and 100,000, she said.
   Their numbers reached into the millions before pioneers began
forging westward and found them to be easy prey, dipping to a
historical low near 1,000 head in 1889, Duvall said.
   Realizing the common misconception that buffalo still are
endangered was a hindrance to marketing efforts, Houck helped form
the Fort Pierre-based association, whose members now number about
1,200 buffalo producers.
   The Houcks began ranching by raising cattle. They switched to
buffalo after a March 1966 blizzard that killed more than 200 of
their cattle but not a single buffalo.
   ``They'll just stick their noses down into the snow and eat this
grass, and they'll stay fat on it,'' Houck said. ``I wonder how
they do it, but they do.''

<HEAD>California Governor Squashes Proposed State Mollusk</HEAD>

   When it comes to representing
California, the banana slug just won't do, Gov. George Deukmejian
said in vetoing a bill that designated the slimy, slothful creature
the state's official mollusk.
   The veto by the image-conscious governor, announced Tuesday,
squashed the hopes of a group of Blue Birds and Camp Fire girls
from the San Francisco Bay area who led the campaign to make the
banana slug a state mascot.
   ``I feel really bad that he vetoed it,'' says Grace Moses, 9,
whose Blue Bird troop worked six weeks lobbying. ``I mean, why did
he have to do that? He didn't know anything about it. I hope he
watched the news about it.''
   Deukmejian said he vetoed the bill because the large, brilliant
yellow mollusk, which can eat poison oak without getting a rash,
isn't a true Californian.
   ``If there is a need to designate a state mollusk, it would be
more appropriate to select one that is indigenous to California and
perhaps one that is more representative of the international
reputation that California enjoys,'' he said in his veto message.
   The governor added that the dubious honor of being the banana
slug's home state may belong to wetter neighbors to the north,
since the species was first identified near the mouth of the
Columbia River in Oregon and lives as far north as Alaska.
   But members of the Redwood City Dynamite Blue Birds and the
office of the legislator who carried their slug bill said the
governor is misinformed about the banana slug, which has the
scientific name Ariolimax columbianus and lives in damp coastal
forest areas throughout the Pacific Northwest.
   Janice Hopcraft, an aide to Democratic Assemblyman Bryon Sher,
said four of five kinds of banana slugs are native to California.
   ``I think basically the banana slug has gotten a bad rap,'' said
Hopcraft, who wore a yellow armband Tuesday in memory of Sher's
bill. ``They're obviously easy to look down upon and they do have
some odd habits. Perhaps, the governor looked too much at that and
not their good side.
   ``As far as its representative qualities, it's absolutely a
unique example of the diversity of California's wildlife.''
   Deukmejian, a Republican who's made a personal campaign of
promoting California trade nationally and overseas, suggested the
Golden State may not need an official slug at all.
   And if California must have a mollusk, he'd prefer the pismo
clam, black abalone, red abalone, turban shell, two-spotted
octupus, common squid or another breed of mussel unique to the
state.
   California has several official mascots, including a tree, a
fossil, a reptile, a fish, a rock and even a state insect in
addition to the usual bird, animal and flower. The Legislature sent
a bill to the governor Monday that would designate the square dance
as the official folk dance, and the West Coast swing, or jitterbug,
as the official dance.
   Deukmejian has not acted on that measure.
   The banana slug gained notoriety a few years ago when students
at the University of California, Santa Cruz chose it as the
official school mascot over the sea lion, despite the objections of
the university's president.

<TEXT>
   To firefighters on the
front lines, breathing the smoke is like going through four packs
of cigarettes a day, but for those elsewhere in Yellowstone, it
poses little danger, doctors say.
   ``I think the main thing is it's much more an irritant,'' said
Dr. Osman Sawyer, who works at the Old Faithful medical clinic in
the nation's oldest national park.
   Allan Pardee, a retiree from Casa Grande, Ariz., who spends
summers working in a general store at Old Faithful, can attest to
the irritation.
   ``Whenever we get these inversions, we'd get all choked up,''
Pardee said Monday when he came to the clinic seeking relief. ``The
last few days, it's been really bad.
   ``We like to walk back and forth to work,'' he continued. ``It's
about three-quarters of a mile, but it's gotten so bad that by the
time we got to work we could hardly talk to anybody.''
   Pardee's decision to turn to the clinic came on the second
straight day of a weather inversion that trapped smoke from fires
five miles away over the Old Faithful complex. At times during the
two-day period the smoke was so heavy that nearby ridges were
obscured.
   ``We tried bandanas and it worked better than nothing,'' he said.
   Tek Kilgore, a nurse, offered him some surgical masks.
   ``This may just let us stay a little longer,'' Pardee said on
the way back to work.
   Smoke conditions in the park were moderate to heavy throughout
the day Tuesday.
   While in past days the smoke has hung over Old Faithful like a
dense morning mist, Sawyer and Kilgore haven't seen a rise in the
number of patients.
   For one thing, said Kilgore, tourism has gone down as the fires
have churned up, and those tourists who have serious respiratory
conditions likely have stayed away.
   While there are no official figures for August, preliminary
statistics show a 15 to 20 percent decline in tourism during the
first two weeks of the month.
   The drop in patients has been noteable, Kilgore said. During
normal summers, 25-30 people seek help at the clinic each day,
compared with just two to five now, said Kilgore.
   Most who have come have had minor respiratory problems, said
Sawyer.
   For those people away from the fire lines, the smoke's biggest
harm is from irritating particulates, said Sawyer.
   ``It's not the same in terms of lung injuries,'' he said. ``It's
probably no different than living in Denver or L.A.''

   Israel's shutdown of Arab labor federations
with 80,000 workers and an association of 108 charities is
disrupting institutions that Palestinians hope will form the basis
of a future state.
   Palestinians charge that destroying grassroots organizations is
the whole object of Israel's move, coming after the outlawing of
the so-called popular committees that have guided the 8-month-old
uprising against Israeli occupation.
   ``They want them closed so when a Palestinian state comes, it
will find no infrastructure,'' said Walid Asali, head of the
Palestinian Lawyers Association, one of seven professional groups
shut by the Israelis.
   Israeli authorities accuse the organizations involved of being
fronts for Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization. They
claim the groups distribute funds, recruit members or organize
protests against Israeli rule.
   An army order closed the Palestinians' Federation of Labor last
Thursday, the professional groups a day later and the Palestinian
charities association last Sunday. All were shut for one year.
   The professional organizations represent a total of 10,000
doctors, lawyers, dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians, engineers
and agricultural specialists. The labor federation groups 55 unions
with 70,000 members and covers almost the whole Palestinian work
force.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy Israeli army spokesman, said the two
institutions and the charity association were ideal conduits for
the PLO underground, providing offices, workers and communications
links.
   ``In the past month, they became more and more active and were
being used by the PLO,'' he said.
   Gissin noted that the groups became more important when the
government recently outlawed so-called popular committees, which
had taken over local government functions such as street cleaning.
   The committees also organized demonstrations and enforced
compliance with general strike calls. The army arrested more than
300 of the groups' leaders.
   Gissin said the PLO also was trying to tighten its grip on
social groups that had been linked to Jordan until King Hussein
announced July 31 that he was cutting adminstrative ties with the
occupied West Bank.
   Ghassan Ayoub, a member of the labor federation's 13-member
executive committee, denied the group was working for the PLO, but
acknowledged that some of its activities furthered the uprising.
   The federation negotiated agreements with Palestinian factories
that guaranteed workers would be paid for days when they took part
in general strikes, Ayoub said.
   He said the group also guaranteed full or partial pay for people
unable to reach their work place because of curfews imposed by
Israel.
   Ayoub said the agreements had nothing to do with the PLO, but
were protections that any union would seek for its members: ``We
are unionists, not politicians.''
   He said the federations' main task was to provide health
insurance to members and assistance to families whose breadwinners
lost their jobs or were injured in the unrest, which has claimed
255 Palestinian lives since it began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also
have died.
   Raed Abu Sabra, another federation official, said the union
group also makes monthly payments of about $120 to families of
workers jailed by Israel.
   Clayton Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative, said last week
that the United States was reviewing Israel's special trade status
after the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee complained of
indiscriminate closures of Palestinian unions.
   But Israeli officials said the complaint did not recognize
Israel's security concerns, and Gissin said the government tried to
be sensitive to the social functions of the institutions.
   ``We have to think twice, because (the groups) serve other
functions such as improving social conditions and social welfare,''
he said. ``We don't want to stop those activities, but when it
involves the PLO we have no choice.''
   Both Ayoub and Asali of the lawyers' association said the
closing down of their offices would not stop their work on behalf
of laborers and professionals. Ayoub said offices of the
federation's various unions remained open throughout the West Bank.
   But the two said seizure of union documents from the offices
would impede their organizations' work.
   Ayoub also said workers' committees were afraid to meet because
of earlier arrests of labor leaders
   He also said he Israel might close union medical clinics. Gissin
said no such action would be taken.
   The 42-year-old Ayoub was released three weeks ago after more
than four months in jail. He was held under a law that does not
require charges to be filed, but he said he was accused of being a
member of Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction.
   He said neither he nor the federation was connected to Fatah,
but added: ``We want our independent state and we feel it's our
right to say so.''

   A Northwest Airlines flight en route from
San Francisco to Detroit made an emergency landing here Tuesday
after fumes from a West German tourist's empty gasoline can filled
the cabin, authorities said.
   Cal Clegg, FBI special agent for Utah, said the flight was
diverted after the crew smelled the fumes.
   ``Without knowing the full details, they decided to divert the
plane to Salt Lake,'' Clegg said.
   He said a West German tourist, whose name and hometown were not
available, was interviewed and authorities determined it was an
innocent mistake.
   ``In a nutshell, one of the passengers, a West German who had
been touring the United States, had taken on board with him what
was an apparently empty gas can that still had vapors in it,''
Clegg said. ``During compression and decompression, the vapors
emitted into the cabin area.''
   Clegg said the tourist, who was traveling alone, had rented a
car earlier and ran out of gas.
   ``He had purchased this can and then decided to take it home to
West Germany with him because he had paid for it and apparently
they don't have metal gasoline cans in West Germany, just
plastic,'' Clegg said.
   He said he was unsure how the man got past security guards
before boarding the plane. The can was in carry-on luggage in a
plastic bag with souvenirs, he said.
   ``According to everybody we interviewed out there, the
individual was totally cooperative,'' Clegg said. ``He apologized
and everything else. There were no threats made. No hostile action
on his part in any way.''
   Frank Ratliff, airport operations manager, said the flight left
Salt Lake City about 5:30 p.m. MDT and the man was released,
although he was not on the flight.
   ``He will be on another flight,'' Ratliff said. ``We will not
file charges and it will be turned over to the FAA.''
   Clegg said the flight had originated in Seattle, but Al Stuart,
airport operations supervisor, said the flight began in San
Francisco.

   Producer-director Stanley Kramer has been
signed to produce and direct a movie about the life of Lech Walesa,
leader of Poland's outlawed Solidarity union.
   The screenplay for the movie, ``Polonaise,'' was written by
Daniel Taradash, who won an Oscar in 1953 for ``Here to Eternity.''
The script is based on lengthy meetings with Walesa in Poland, the
newly formed Movie Associates Inc. said in announcing the project
Tuesday.
   Kramer, 74, has tackled numerous films about social issues
including ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,'' ``Judgment at
Nuremberg,'' and ``Inherit the Wind.''
   Other Kramer films include ``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World''
and ``The Runner Stumbles.''
   Production is to begin in the fall.

   A Chinese jetliner landing in pouring rain
skidded into the sea off the runway at Hong Kong's airport
Wednesday and broke in half, killing six of the 89 people on board,
the government said.
   Flight 301 from Canton, the capital of China's Guangdong
province about 90 miles northwest of this British colony, crashed
at 9:19 a.m. (9:19 p.m. EDT), government-run Radio Television Hong
Kong reported.
   Five of the dead were among the 11-member Chinese crew,
according to a statement released by the airline. The nationality
of the single dead passenger was not immediately known.
   The radio reported that at least three of the dead were
recovered from the wreckage of the plane, which was partially
submerged. Thirteen people were injured.
   Hundreds of divers, aided by helicopters and boats, scoured the
water in search of survivors.
   Small rubber rafts with rescue personnel bobbed around the
wreckage of the British Aerospace Trident jet as fire engines
crowded onto Kai Tak Airport's only runway, which juts into
Victoria Harbor.
   `It fell into the sea at the end of the runway,'' police
spokesman Tony Leung said of the jetliner of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China, China's flag carrier.
   The Government Information Services said 83 people were rescued
and 13 were hospitalized. It said the plane carried 78 passengers
and 11 crew members.
   Government spokesmen at the scene said six people were confirmed
dead.
   The radio interviewed an unidentified passenger who claimed that
some of the plane's safety belts did not work. ``That's why when
the plane landed so hard, people simply were flying,'' the woman
passenger told the station.
   Japanese media in Tokyo reported the flight manifest indicated
12 Japanese were on the plane. An official at Queen Elizabeth
Hospital in Hong Kong said one of the injured was from France. The
government said the rest of the injured were Chinese.
   The radio reported that helicopters ferried some of the rescued
passengers to military hospitals and that an emergency treatment
center was set up at the airport.
   All incoming and outgoing flights were canceled, the radio said.
   There was no immediate indication of what caused the accident.
   The worst accident at Kai Tak occurred in 1967, when a Thai
International flight crashed into the harbor killing 24 of 73
people on board.
   Two cargo planes have crashed on take-off from Kai Tak since
then, but no one was killed in those accidents.

<TEXT>
   There's probably no way for national TV talk
shows to completely safeguard themselves against determined
hoaxers, say the producers of three shows that featured ``guests''
who turned out to be phonies.
   Two part-time actors said Tuesday they posed as people with
sexual problems to get on national television, putting one over on
Oprah Winfrey, Sally Jessy Raphael and Gerald Rivera.
   Tani Freiwald, 37, and Wes Bailey, 33, both of Chicago, appeared
Tuesday on yet another talk show, ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``After you go through the first one, they get really easy,''
Ms. Freiwald said.
   Ms. Freiwald said she first appeared in November on ``The Oprah
Winfrey Show'' in Chicago, posing as a woman who had been married
14 years and hated sex.
   ``I don't see anyway we could have double checked this guest's
(Ms. Freiwald's) story based on the fact that she was presented to
us on a doctor's referral,'' said Debra DiMaio, Winfrey's executive
producer.
   ``I consider it to be an isolated incident _ I don't think there
are a lot of people who want to come on national television and
create a personal problem that's probably considered embarrassing
by the general public.''
   Bailey and Ms. Freiwald said they were asked to appear on the
talk shows by a Chicago psychologist-author, Dean C. Dauw, for whom
Ms. Freiwald was working as an office manager.
   ``He asked me to do it because the surrogates he does have
working for him are neither presentable or articulate enough'' to
go on television, Ms. Freiwald said.
   Dauw did not return calls to his home or office, but he was
quoted by the Omaha World-Herald as saying that Ms. Freiwald worked
as an office manager and a sex surrogate, a stand-in sexual partner
employed by a therapist, and Bailey was a client and that they were
not acting.
   In May, Ms. Freiwald and Bailey appeared on ``The Sally Jessy
Raphael Show,'' which originates from New Haven, Conn., with Bailey
posing as an impotent husband and Ms. Freiwald as his sex
surrogate. In July, they appeared on ``Geraldo,'' Bailey playing a
35-year-old virgin and Ms. Freiwald, a sex surrogate.
   Bailey said the only time he was worried during the talk-show
stints was when Raphael assured the studio audience that the two
were not actors reproducing a scene.
   ``There was a little clenching in the stomachs ... but we've
both been performers all our adult lives,'' Bailey said.
   Burt Dubrow, Raphael's executive producer, said the show was
simply duped, despite its safeguards.
   ``How do you know you're really talking to Burt Dubrow?'' he
asked during a telephone interview. ``You don't. We have basically
the same procedures as you do. We go to people who are credible and
legitimate. In this particular case we went to a doctor who wrote
seven books, we asked him if he knew of a sex surrogate, and he
found someone who worked for him. ... He's claiming as early as
this morning to me that she is a sex surrogate, so we don't know
exactly where we stand.''
   Rivera reacted angrily Monday when he learned the real
identities of his ``guests.''
   ``These people are admitting now to having committed fraud or at
least misrepresentation ... and we're going to go after them,''
Rivera said.
   ``This is something that goes right to the integrity of the
broadcast itself. I'm really spitting mad.''
   Delia Fine, his senior producer, said guests are often found
with the help of experts and organizations and then put through a
rigorous pre-interview process.
   ``If someone really has the intention to put one over on you,
I'm not sure what all the safeguards are to protect yourself,'' she
said.
   Ms. Fine said guests sign a release ``that says basically
they're going to be telling the truth.''
   ``We absolutely try and do everything we can do, but if someone
is determined to do it there always are ways to get through,'' said
Lorri Benson, senior producer of ``Donahue,'' which was not a
victim this time.
   ``Thank God we weren't involved in this one, but it does, I
think, hurt everybody's credibility.''

   Vietnam is again willing to cooperate with the
United States in accounting for the more than 1,700 American
military personnel still missing in the Vietnam War, the State
Department says.
   Vietnamese officials had suspended cooperation Aug. 3 in
retaliation against U.S. unwillingness to improve diplomatic
relations until Hanoi withdraws troops from Cambodia.
   A U.S. technical team will meet next month with Vietnamese
authorities in Hanoi to work out details for a joint field survey
and excavation activities in Vietnam, department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said on Tuesday. She said a U.S. team also will
visit Hanoi on Sept. 5-8 to discuss a plan to allow private
American organizations to treat Vietnamese with war-related
disabilities.
   Mrs. Oakley said Vietnam has not agreed to resume discussions on
resettlement in the United States of former political detainees who
were associated with the former U.S.-backed government in Saigon.

test-marketing,'' said John Banzhaf, executive director of Action
on Smoking and Health, based in Washington, D.C. ``They wanted to
get a jump on it. After all, it's a lot more difficult to get the
genie back in the bottle after the fact.''
   Reynolds Tobacco announced Tuesday that the new cigarette, which
simulates smoking by heating a flavor capsule instead of burning
tobacco, will be test-marketed in St. Louis, Phoenix and Tucson,
Ariz., starting Oct. 1.
   Reynolds, one of the nation's largest cigarette manufacturers
and a subsidiary of Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco Inc., began selling
the new brand, Premier, this week to distributors, supermarkets and
discount chains in the cities.
   While it will cost about 25 percent more _ or about 30 cents a
pack _ than the company's other brands, Reynolds believes it could
become its best-selling brand. The company will use a variety of
messages, including one that touts the cigarette as ``Premier _ the
Cleaner Smoke.''
   Banzhaf said about two dozen anti-smoking groups met with Food
and Drug Administration officials recently to urge the agency to
regulate the cigarette.
   Joyce Taylor, branch director of the Arizona Lung Association in
Tucson, said that if the FDA doesn't get involved, smokers won't
know what they're inhaling.
   ``My theory is that regardless of what (company officials) are
saying, if they're going to light it, they're still going to have
carbon monoxide, which is one of the major irritants in smoke, and
nicotine,'' she said.
   ``They're not telling us what's in that packet. They don't want
the FDA to be involved, because then they would have to tell
everybody what they put into tobacco smoke.''
   Company officials, however, are not making any health claims,
which could invite scrutiny by the FDA.
   ``If a product is sold with claims to make cigarettes safer, it
is a medical device'' and subject to FDA approval, said William
Grigg, an agency spokesman.
   ``This is not a safe or safer cigarette,'' said Richard Kampe,
president of Reynolds' development divison. ``It's a cleaner
cigarette.'' He said the term ``smokeless cigarette'' used by the
media to describe the product is a misnomer.
   The cigarette contains a packet of tobacco extracts that is
heated, not burned, through a ``carbon heat source'' lit at the
tip. The result is a cigarette without odor and only a trace of ash
or smoke that could irritate people nearby, Kampe said.
   ``It reduces many of the controversial compounds associated with
burning cigarettes and virtually eliminates sidestream smoke,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Officer Recounts Dramatic Submarine Rescue</HEAD>

   Peruvian sailors broke the Pacific's surface
``gasping and screaming from pain'' after a rapid 110-foot ascent
from their sunken submarine, which was running out of fresh air, a
navy officer said.
   The Peruvian navy said Tuesday that one of the sailors died of
the bends on Monday but that the others were recovering.
   The navy originally said 21 sailors were saved Saturday with a
U.S.-supplied diving bell that brought them slowly to the surface.
   But the officer, who participated in the rescue operation, said
Tuesday that the diving bell did not arrive in time for the trapped
crewmen, who ``would surely have died'' if they did not use a
dangerous escape chamber similar to a torpedo tube.
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that after
their escape the men, suffering from severe cases of the bends,
were rushed in speedboats to decompression chambers on shore.
   Four other sailors were killed shortly after the Japanese
fishing boat Kyowa Maru rammed the submarine Pacocha on Friday
three miles off the Callao harbor, causing the vessel to sink in 15
minutes.
   The navy said 45 sailors of the 52 sailors aboard either were
rescued or survived by jumping into the water as the submarine went
down.
   Three sailors are still missing and presumed dead.
   The submarine's commander Daniel Nieve and three crewmen were
killed shortly after the crash. The navy said Nieve led the
evacuation but died sealing a hatch to protect the men inside.
   The navy officer who spoke with The Associated Press gave this
account:
   Rescuers reached the site at 8 p.m. and divers swam to the
crippled Pacocha shortly after midnight. The vessel was half full
of water and divers did not think anyone was alive.
   Divers tapped in code on the crippled submarine's hull, which
drew a response and the trapped crewmen began communicating with
divers via a message hatch on the craft's side.
   ``They said they had food and air and everyone was calm,'' the
officer said.
   At 8 a.m. Saturday navy officials decided to await help from the
United States and a specially-designed diving bell was due late
Saturday night.
   But air supplies dwindled faster than expected and toxic gas
from the vessel's flooded batteries began seeping into the dry
compartment where the sailors had sealed themselves.
   Attempts to inject air from another submarine failed.
   At 9:30 a.m. the trapped crewmen sent a message saying they
needed air and were going to attempt to escape the vessel using an
emergency pressure chamber, a life-threatening maneuver even if
successful.
   Four men at a time, wearing life preservers and masks, crammed
into a tiny chamber similar to a torpedo tube, sealed themselves
from the craft, allowed in water to equalize pressure with the
ocean, and opened a hatch.
   An instant earlier, they emptied their lungs of air because a
rapid release of pressure at the surface could explode their lungs.
   Divers waited outside the sub and aimed the crewmen toward the
surface. The sailors shot more than 100 feet in 30 seconds, pushed
up by their life preservers.
   ``They came up gasping and screaming from pain,'' due to the
tremendous pressure change, the officer said.
   The first group, which escaped at about 10:30 a.m., was followed
by groups every hour or two. The final three hit the surface at
6:15 p.m., more than 22 hours after the submarine sank.
   One of the 21 crewmen died Monday from a cerebral embulism
caused by his ascent from the ocean floor, but officials said the
others appeared out of danger.
   The bends, or decompression sickness, is caused by the formation
of nitrogen bubbles in the blood or body tissues as the result of a
sudden lowering of atmospheric pressure. It is characterized by
tightness in the chest, by pains in the joints, and by convulsions
and collapse in severe cases.

   Hazel Dawn, whose singing and acting career in
the early 1900s included a starring role in the original ``Ziegfeld
Follies,'' has died. She was 98.
   Miss Dawn died Sunday at the home of her daughter in Manhattan.
   She began her career in London musical comedies and made her
Broadway stage debut in 1911 in a hit musical, ``The Pink Lady.''
   Miss Dawn went on to become a celebrated singer and actress
until her marriage in 1927 to a Montana mining engineer, Charles
Gruwell, after which she largely gave up her career.
   After Gruwell, reportedly ``one of the richest men in the
West,'' died in 1941, she went to work in the casting department of
the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. She retired from there
about 25 years ago.
   Miss Dawn is survived by her daughter, Dawn Gruwell Kaufman, and
her son, Charles E. Gruwell, both of New York, five grandsons and
seven great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Drawn by adventure and hopes of big
profits, Florida's 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are getting
ready to begin the state's first legal gator hunt in 26 years.
   More than 5,000 novice and skilled hunters alike scrambled to
apply for the permits after game officials announced the hunt,
designed to trim an alligator population that was once threatened
by poachers but is now an estimated at 1 million.
   Wide-eyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps, lakes and
streams with hopes of cashing in on their catch, which can bring as
much as $1,000 for a 10-foot gator's skin and meat.
   But some experts are wondering if the permit holders really know
what they're in for.
   ``You got to laugh when you hear these people say they're going
to make money off this hunt,'' said 37-year-old Dale Dunaway, who
operates one of Florida's few alligator processing plants.
   ``They don't figure in the time, expenses _ and don't forget the
danger,'' Dunaway said Tuesday. ``I'd like to see some people's
faces the first time a gator takes a bite at their airboat.
   For 30 days beginning at sunset Thursday, the randomly selected
permit holders will be allowed to hunt in designated areas where
the gator population is extraordinarily high.
   Waterfront residents all over Florida called for a hunt against
the carnivorous reptiles after a 10{-foot bull gator killed
4-year-old Erin Glover in the Gulf Coast community of Englewood in
June.
   But game officials have placed tight restrictions on the hunt.
Permit holders will be working at night, when flashlights make the
reptiles' eyes glow eerily red. And they are not allowed to use
guns, relying on clubs, traps and hooks attached to poles.
   The harvest is limited to up to 3,435 gators, with each hunter
limited to 15 gators each.
   ``We expect to be up non-stop from Thursday until about Monday,
either skinning or hunting,'' Dunaway said at his 2-year-old
processing operation in this remote southwest Florida town. ``We're
gonna be looking at a lot of dead gators.''
   Skinning an average alligator is a full day's work, Dunaway
reckons.
   First he plunges his hunting knife through the gator's thick
hide at the tip of its tail. Then, it's a slow and difficult cut to
the snout.
   ``You got to look at it as an hour a foot to properly skin and
gut a gator,'' said Dunaway. ``There's no way around it. It's hard
work, you bet.''
   Some of the experienced hunters will be permitted to use the
equipment at the gator house, a cement frame enclosed by screen
wire and decorated by deer antlers.
   But the novice trappers will have to sit and watch their catch
be pried apart.
   Alligators are cut up the back to preserve the valuable hide
covering the belly and underarms, said Dunaway. The hide, which
sells for about $42 a foot to foreign manufacturers, is submerged
in a brine solution for about a week.
   The excess flesh is then scraped off and the skin is sun dried.
   ``And we bury the innards as far away as possible,'' said
Dunaway. ``They got a powerful smell and if you ever cut open the
stomach you better start running.''
   The meat, which Dunaway says makes a nice addition to spaghetti
sauce, must be frozen within hours after the alligator is killed.
One 12-foot gator bought to the plant in 1986 yielded 230 pounds of
meat.
   ``You're fixing to eat gator for a long time with a catch like
that,'' said Dunaway's 24-year-old brother, Grant.
   Yet the gator business is just a hobby for the Dunaways and
their uncle William Busby, 36. All will take vacation time from
their jobs to process the gators.
   They say the best they can do charging a $30 fee and $2 a pound
is break even.
   ``We just like it out here with the gators,'' said Grant.

<HEAD>Some Georgia Blacks Dukakis Campaign Unresponsive To Their
Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's failed
presidential bid continue to have difficulties with the Georgia
campaign of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, with one black
leader leaving the Dukakis camp amid complaints of unreasonable
demands from Jackson loyalists.
   The Rev. Cameron Alexander, designated as a co-chairman of the
Dukakis campaign in Georgia, Tuesday accused the campaign of
ignoring the political demands by Jackson backers aimed at
promoting the interests of minorities.
   Michael deVegter, director of the Dukakis campaign in Georgia,
said that Jackson forces had made unreasonable demands during weeks
of negotiations, including that all major contacts with the black
community be channeled through the Jackson organization and that 40
percent of the funds of the Georgia Dukakis campaign be controlled
by the Jackson forces.

   A voter registration plan is being worked out by
Massachusetts backers of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and aides to
Michael Dukakis.
   The two camps have met nearly every Tuesday since the Democratic
convention in July. To date, the meetings at Dukakis presidential
campaign headquarters have produced few specifics. But participants
on both sides said the process itself was an important expression
of cooperation.
   ``This is a part of our outreach _ sitting down at the table
with Jackson supporters and saying, `What do you think? We
appreciate your input,''' Phil Stanley, the Massachusetts
coordinator for the Dukakis campaign, said Tuesday.
   ``We are trying to get the campaign to be more reflective of the
diversity within the state and to embrace the Jackson constituency
in a more significant way than we've had to date,'' said Boston
City Councilor Bruce Bolling, the top Jackson coordinator for
Massachusetts.

   A national association of nurses is endorsing
Democrat Michael Dukakis for president.
   The American Nurses' Association, which says it represents the
more than 2 million registered nurses in the United States, says
one out of every 44 registered women voters is a nurse.
   Irene Agnos, chairwoman of the group's political action
committee, said the positions of Dukakis and running mate Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen on health care issues were a key factor in the
endorsement.
   ``We think that as president, Dukakis will make a difference for
this country and for health care consumers, and we look forward to
making a difference in his campaign,'' said Lucille Joel, nurses
association president.
   The organization in 1985 decided it would endorse a presidential
candidate after interviewing both major party candidates.
Association officials recently met with Dukakis, but Republican
George Bush declined their invitation to be interviewed, according
to an association news release.

<TEXT>
   Two Soviets and the first Afghan in space docked
their Soyuz-TM 6 capsule with the Mir orbiting space station today,
joining two Soviet cosmonauts who have been in space more than
eight months, Tass reported.
   The state-run news agency said the capsule linked up with the
space station at 9:41 a.m. Moscow time (1:41 a.m. EDT).
   ``The cosmonauts feel well,'' Tass said in a brief dispatch.
   The capsule, launched two days ago from the Baikonur Space
Center in Soviet Central Asia, carried a veteran cosmonaut, a
doctor and an Afghan air force pilot.
   Soviet television showed a live transmission of the crew
entering the space station and meeting with the cosmonauts already
on board.
   Afghan cosmonaut Abdul Ahad Mohmand was shown reading portions
of the Koran, the Moslem holy book.
   The cosmonauts who have been aboard Mir for eight months have
been reported in good health, but Dr. Valery Polyakov will stay on
to monitor their health as they try to set an endurance record.
   Tass did not say how long Mohmand and the third new arrival,
Vladimir Lyakhov, would remain aboard the station with its crew.
   Polyakov, an expert on space endurance, is to monitor the health
of Vladimir Titov, 40, and Musa Manarov, 37, who have been in space
since Dec., 21 and are hoping to break a 326-day endurance record
set by Yuri Romanenko.
   Tass said Polyakov had bone marrow removed before the flight.
When he returns to Earth, more marrow is to be removed and the
samples compared.
   Scientists are trying to determine how to counter bone marrow
depletion, which results from prolonged space flight. Polyakov also
will study motion sickness.
   Space officials say the endurance tests are a step toward
determining whether a manned flight to Mars, which they estimate
would take three years, is feasible.
   Mohmand, 29, is to take part in experiments to identify oil, gas
and other mineral deposits in Afghanistan and to predict runoff of
snow and ice in efforts to alleviate water shortages.
   His presence represents efforts by the Kremlin to boost the
prestige of Afghanistan's pro-Soviet government as Soviet troops
withdraw. The Soviets have agreed to withdraw all their troops by
Feb. 15. Half of the 100,000 soldiers have left Afghanistan since
withdrawal began in May.
   The flight is the 47-year-old Lyakhov's third space mission. He
was in space for 175 days in 1979 and took part in a 150-day
mission in 1983.

<HEAD>Harvard In Pact With TV Networks, Writers To Fight Drunken Driving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime time TV characters this fall will begin
turning down drinks in a coordinated assault on drunken driving
initiated by Harvard University health researchers.
   Make-believe wives will designate make-believe husbands as
non-drinking drivers. Teen-agers who drink will take taxis. And for
the next few years polltakers will be trying to find out if viewers
are coming under the influence of the push for a ``designated
driver.''
   ``The goal of the project is to achieve a fundamental change in
American social norms regarding drinking and driving,'' Jay
Winsten, assistant dean of Harvard's School of Public Health and
director of its Center for Health Communication, said Tuesday night.
   ``In attempting to achieve that change, we're asking the
entertainment, communication and advertising industries to work
with us to add momentum behind changes that are already beginning
to occur in America,'' he said of the Harvard Alcohol Project.
   Winsten said the commitment was made by 13 television studios in
Los Angeles that are responsible for more than 70 percent of prime
time weekly programming on ABC, CBS and NBC.
   The executives pledged to ask their writers and producers to
introduce in their scripts the notion that drinking and driving is
taboo, through devices as simple as having drinkers take taxis or
saying, ``No thanks, I'm driving.''
   Winsten said if the television campaign succeeds, others will be
tried. But drunken driving was the priority, he said, reciting
these statistics: drunken driving kills 24,000 people each year;
studies show as few as two drinks can make a fatal accident twice
as likely; two of five Americans will be victims of a drunken
driver.
   In January, Winsten began meeting with Hollywood executives to
forge the agreements. In April, he won a unanimous endorsement from
the board of the Writers Guild of America-West, whose members write
for prime time TV.
   The networks also agreed to run public service announcements in
December to encourage the ``designated driver'' idea, The New York
Times reported today.
   The New York advertising firm, Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton,
has provided advertising research on the designated driver idea,
and the Gallup Organization said it will donate its services to
poll the public to find out whether the TV campaign is working, the
newspaper said.
   Gallup research shows that 78 percent of all drivers would be
willing to serve occasionally as designated drivers.
   Winsten said the campaign will continue for at least three to
five years before its real impact will be known.
   The campaign has precedents, he said. Television networks during
the past year or two have been using their characters to encourage
the use of seatbelts and to try to take the glamour out of alcohol.
But Winsten said he believed this was the first such effort
mobilized by a school of public health.

   Four councilmen refused a third time to
change their votes against a housing desegregation plan, as
requests from them and the city to continue a stay of contempt
fines went to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Unless the Supreme Court takes their side, the defiant
councilmen will be hit with criminal charges, the state agency that
has taken over Yonkers' finances warned Tuesday.
   `It's the city councilmen who are defying the law and putting
the city's financial profile at risk, who are putting all the
citizens of Yonkers at risk,'' said Gail Shaffer, head of the
state's Emergency Financial Control Board.
   The $500-a-day fines against the councilmen, along with
potentially devastating fines against the city that could reach $1
million a day, were imposed by federal Judge Leonard Sand. He found
them in contempt Aug. 2, the day after the council's first 4-3
rejection of the court-ordered plan.
   On Friday, a federal appeals panel upheld the contempt finding
but gave Yonkers a week to take the case to the Supreme Court
before reinstating the penalties.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall on Tuesday referred the four
applications from the councilmen and one from the city to the full
Supreme Court, according to a court spokesman who gave no
indication when the court might rule on a stay.
   Only after a stay is granted would the court consider the appeal
of Sand's contempt finding.
   At the City Council's regular meeting Tuesday night, Councilmen
Henry Spallone, Nicholas Longo, Edward Fagan and Peter Chema again
rejected a zoning amendment needed to carry out a housing plan that
the council had accepted last January.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, during a visit to Yonkers, said the city
must ``end its illegal resistance'' to the plan. He added that he
would be willing to meet with the four but would not specify when
that would happen.
   Three of the four said they would be happy to meet with Jackson,
while Spallone said, ``Have him call me.''
   Sand ordered the plan to remedy what he determined in a 1985
ruling to have been 40 years of deliberate segregation in housing
and education in the city.
   The plan calls for 200 low-income public housing units to be
built in the predominantly white east side of Yonkers, with 800
moderate-income apartments to be built throughout the city.
   Unless a stay is granted, the fines, currently suspended, will
be reimposed Friday. The councilmen have paid $3,500 each. The city
has paid $12,700. Its daily payment would resume at $12,800 and
double daily until it reaches $1 million a day, when it will be
capped.
   That would give the city an estimated 70 days until bankruptcy.
   Shaffer said that if the Supreme Court appeal is turned down,
she will notify District Attorney Carl Vergari that the councilmen
are breaking state law by endangering the city's fiscal stability.
   The four already face possible imprisonment as early as Sunday
for contempt.
   ``I feel it is unfortunate that people elected to uphold the law
and defend the law are breaking and defying the law,'' Shaffer said.
   Her remarks came a day after Gov. Mario Cuomo said he would
initiate removal proceedings and urge the councilmen's jailing if
the Supreme Court refused the stay.

   Here is a chronology of the main
political events in Chile since Gen. Augusto Pinochet seized power
in a coup 15 years ago:
   Sept. 11, 1973 _ Pinochet leads the armed forces in a bloody
coup that overthrows President Salvador Allende, a Marxist elected
in 1970. Allende dies in the coup and the new government says he

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Down In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, while share prices fell back.
   The dollar opened at 134.93 yen and inched up to close the day
at 134.97 yen, up 0.58 yen from Tuesday's close of 134.39 yen. It
moved between 134.80 yen and 135.13 yen, with spot trading
estimated at $5.9 billion.
   ``The dollar rose because investors started selling the yen,
realizing that interest rates in Japan have become the lowest,''
said a foreign exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo.
   ``The rise in interest rates in Europe last week is finally
affecting us,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 132.55 points Tuesday, lost 145.70
points, or 0.53 percent, closing the day at 27,365.95.
   Although the market opened higher, the Nikkei index then
reversed direction and lost its earlier gains.
   The weakening yen was the main cause of the stock market's
decline, a trader with a major securities firm in Tokyo said.
   ``Investors got discouraged by the weakening yen, and the
trading was very thin,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Volume on the market's first section was estimated at
400 million shares.
   Stock prices were lower almost across the board except for a few
high-tech issues, such as Sony and Matsushita, which some investors
bought shortly before the closing of the market, the trader said.

<TEXT>
   California firefighters battled more than 170 fires, while gusts
in Yellowstone threatened to fan a 90,000-acre blaze toward 600
cabins and the park superintendent said there was no end in sight
to this summer's wildfires.
   Montana ranchers prepared for possible evacuation today, and
crews fought woodland blazes in Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Nevada
and Utah.
   In California, nearly 9,500 lightning strikes Tuesday sparked
scores of blazes a year after a similar barrage spawned devastating
fires. Firefighters said more than 4,600 acres had burned, but they
held most of the blazes to an acre or less in the drought-parched
wildlands.
   Crews were hampered by 100-plus-degree temperatures, winds and
lightning in some areas. The unfavorable conditions were expected
to continue today.
   Altogether on state land, 73 lightning-sparked fires burned
2,700 acres, said state Department of Forestry spokeswoman Karen
Terrill.
   U.S. Forest Service spokesman Matt Mathes said 43
lightning-caused fires in Southern California national forests
burned just 30 acres, while 60 blazes in Northern California
national forests blackened 1,900 acres.
   ``We are flying over the areas to determine if there are any
(other) hot spots,'' Terrill said.
   Near San Francisco, fire swept through dry brush and trees
Tuesday in Orinda, destroying five houses and badly damaging two
others.
   Police believe an electronically ignited toy rocket may have
sparked the blaze, which was controlled in about two hours without
reports of injuries.
   ``This has been the worst time of my life,'' said Beverly Hopp,
whose 33-year-old home was destroyed. ``What do you do after all
these years?''
   The only thing she and her husband, Al, could save was a desk
containing money and insurance papers.
   In Wyoming, flames from the 90,000-acre North Fork fire at
Yellowstone National Park moved to within a quarter-mile Tuesday of
the Canyon hotel and campground complex. A military helicopter
dropped foam on the visitors center and other buildings in the
complex, which includes hundreds of wooden cabins.
   Park officials closed the area last week when flames moved to
within a half mile.
   Firefighters hoped for an early winter to quell blazes burning
about a fifth of the 2.2 million-acre park, but Yellowstone's
superintendent offered little encouragement.
   ``When will this end? Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, that's
anybody's guess,'' Robert Barbee told about 100 people Tuesday
night at a meeting in nearby Gardiner, Mont.
   Gusty winds forecast for this afternoon threatened to again
close some park roads that were put off limits Tuesday afternoon
but later reopened. The wind ended several days of calm weather.
   Yellowstone spokeswoman Linda Young said activity on the
34,000-acre Wolf Lake fire forced closure of one road, and a
flareup in North Fork blaze closed Yellowstone's west entrance for
several hours. The entrance was later reopened, but Young said it
could be closed again today depending on the fire's activity.
   To the north in Montana, winds played havoc with efforts to
control the 190,000-acre Clover-Mist fire, burning in Yellowstone
and in neighboring Shoshone National Forest.
   Officials closed U.S. 212 near Cooke City for a time Tuesday as
soldiers chased spot fires.
   Ranchers were planning for possible evacuation today along
western Montana's Rocky Mountain Front where a previously
``let-it-burn'' wilderness fire jumped onto national forest and
private land Tuesday. Hundreds of firefighters rushed to keep it
from spreading further.
   The 39,000-acre blaze in the Scapegoat Wilderness roared into
Lewis and Clark National Forest, burning 7,000 additional acres.
   Livestock and horses were removed from cabins threatened by the
9-week-old blaze, which was sparked by lightning, and some ranchers
left as a precaution. Authorities did not know how many people
lived in the sparsely populated area.
   In Idaho, crews near the Wyoming line worked to protect ranches
in the Caribou National Forest after a 6,000-acre fire burned to
within a mile of the properties Tuesday. One family was evacuated
because they lack a telephone and couldn't be notified in case the
blaze blew up. Seventeen major fires are burning 70,000 acres in
Idaho.
   The number of firefighters more than doubled Tuesday to 679 at
Oregon's biggest forest fire, which has burned 36,000 acres in the
Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's Canyon National
Recreation Area.
   Favorable weather in eastern Washington helped thousands of
firefighters gain a handle on fires burning on more than 23,000
acres. Winds were light Tuesday as crews cut trails around nearly
70 percent of major fires on the Colville Indian Reservation and
the Colville National Forest, officials said.

   Here is a brief outline of forest fires in the Western states:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WYOMING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eight forest fires are burning in Yellowstone National Park and
four in the surrounding national forests in northwestern Wyoming.
   Flames from the 90,000-acre North Fork fire at Yellowstone moved
to within a quarter-mile Tuesday of the Canyon hotel and campground
complex. A military helicopter dropped foam on the Canyon visitors
center and other buildings.
   The fires have charred about 450,000 acres of the 2.2
million-acre park. Officials said they have spent $54.4 million
fighting them and about 8,400 firefighters, including hundreds of
soldiers, are at work.
   The largest fire outside Yellowstone, the Mink Creek fire,
covers 108,000 acres of the Bridger-Teton National Forest.

<HEAD>MONTANA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eight major fires had burned about 188,000 acres of Montana
forests by Tuesday. Four were in designated wilderness areas,
including one that has spread into Yellowstone National Park.
Ranchers near the growing, 46,000-acre Scapegoat Wilderness blaze,
the state's largest, were warned they may have to evacuate today.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IDAHO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,500 firefighters and dozens of National Guardsmen
were fighting 17 major fires over 70,000 acres.
   Crews were expected to use bulldozers to dig fire lines today
around ranches in the Caribou National Forest threatened by the
7,000-acre Trail Creek blaze. Crews also were protecting summer
homes from the 17,000-acre Battle Axe wilderness fire northeast of
Challis and a communications site from the 3300-acre West Jay fire
in the Clearwater National Forest east of Lewiston. More than $3
million in commercial timber has been lost, mostly to the
7,500-acre Eagle Bar fire near Hells Canyon on the Oregon border.
   The terrain is parched by a second straight year of drought, and
Gov. Cecil Andrus put the entire state under an extreme fire
emergency.

<HEAD>OREGON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Forces battling Oregon's biggest forest fire, the 35,700-acre
lightning-sparked Tepee Butte blaze in the state's northeastern
corner, were more than doubled Tuesday to 679 people.
   In the state's eastern high desert, firefighters expected to
contain today the Shirttail Creek fire, 30 miles southeast of
Baker. The fire broke out Monday in an industrial area and burned
5,000 acres of rangeland.
   More than 52,000 acres have burned since lighting storms touched
off fires last week.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CALIFORNIA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 9,500 lightning strikes Monday and early Tuesday ignited
more than 170 brush and timber blazes in California, a year after a
similar storm spawned devastating fires.
   Although most of the fires were kept to an acre or less,
firefighters said hot, windy weather in the drought-parched forests
hindered their work.
   In the San Francisco Bay area, fire swept through dry brush and
trees Tuesday in Orinda, destroying five houses and badly damaging
two others. Police believe an electronically ignited toy rocket may
have sparked the blaze.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WASHINGTON:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Favorable weather helped thousands of firefighters gain a handle
on major fires burning on more than 23,000 acres of trees and brush
in eastern Washington state.
   Winds were light Tuesday as crews cut trails around nearly 70
percent of separate major fires on the Colville Indian Reservation
and the Colville National Forest.
   The state's largest fire was on the Indian reservation, where
9,250 acres of timber and brush burned.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UTAH:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters predicted imminent control over a 525-acre fire
near northern Utah's Pineview Reservoir. Crews also were getting
the upper hand on two small fires, the 60-acre North Millcreek
blaze, in eastern Utah's Uinta Mountains, and the 30-acre
Butterfield Canyon fire in Salt Lake County.
   Also in northern Utah, Salt Lake County crews used shovels to
put the finishing touches on a 100-acre brush and grass fire in
Butterfield Canyon.

<HEAD>Two Former Continental Illinois Officials Sentenced To Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two ex-bank officers sentenced to prison
for crimes that contributed to the near-collapse of Continental
Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. held his head and wept as he
apologized for the people he had hurt.
   Sentenced Tuesday were John R. Lytle, a former Continental vice
president, and William G. Patterson, the head of energy lending at
the now-defunct Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City.
   Lytle, 53, and Patterson, 38, pleaded guilty June 30 to one
criminal charge each for a scheme in which Lytle allegedly took
kickbacks in exchange for arranging to have Continental buy
millions of dollars in risky energy loans from Penn Square.
   Penn Square failed in 1982, and Continental Illinois nearly
collapsed two years later after an unprecedented run on its
deposits. Continental was kept afloat by a $4.5 billion government
bailout.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur sentenced Lytle to 3{ years in
prison, despite Lytle's pleas for probation. Shadur sentenced
Patterson to a 2-year term. The maximum sentence allowed under
their plea bargain was five years.
   Patterson, who held his head and choked back tears as he spoke
in his own defense, said he was sorry for his actions and was
concerned about his family. He had sought a sentence of probation
and community service.
   ``I'm sorry for the people in Chicago and Oklahoma,'' he said.
``I think of that a lot.''
   Patterson's attorney, Burck Bailey, said after the sentencing,
``We're relieved to have it behind us.''
   Lytle, testifying before his sentencing, said he accepted
responsibility for his actions. He asked the judge to sentence him
to no more than six months in prison and assign him to work with
the poor on Chicago's West Side.
   But the judge said Lytle seemed, at times, ``unwilling to
confront the realities'' of what he had done.
   ``You allowed your conduct as a bank officer ... to be driven
impermissibly by your desire for personal benefits,'' Shadur said.
   Lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds, while
Patterson pleaded guilty to a charge that he aided and abetted
Lytle. The pleas came two months after a trial of the two ended
with a deadlocked jury.
   Prosecutors said Patterson had manipulated Lytle and a third
man, Oklahoma drilling contractor Jere Sturgis, in schemes to save
his own failing bank. Sturgis was acquitted of wire fraud charges.
   Defense attorneys contended that Continental Illinois was
saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive
lending policy.

   Sister Barbara Hawkins, the principal of
Josephinum High School, once thought she'd have to hold a memorial
service, not a birthday party, when the all-girls school turns 100
in two years.
   The school on the city's rough West Side was set to close as
recently as 1985, but the Sisters of Christian Charity
underestimated the will of alumni, parents and corporations who
opened their wallets to help keep the Roman Catholic school alive.
   Today, the donations are increasing and enrollment has soared 50
percent. For now, Sister Hawkins says, the school is in good
condition, no longer on the critical list.
   ``We're growing,'' says Assistant Principal Ron Rescigno, who
often makes a recruiting pitch from church pulpits in the mostly
Hispanic neighborhood. ``When parents come in with their kids they
say they can't tolerate the public schools.''
   The longstanding troubles in Chicago's public school system have
indeed helped Josephinum, where only about half of the 310 students
are Catholic.
   Frustrated by teacher strikes and violence, and concerned about
the quality of a system labeled one of the nation's worst by
outgoing U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett, many parents are
sending children elsewhere.
   ``That's a repeated story,'' Sister Hawkins said. ``We had 48
students who transferred here last year. They've been to public
school. They didn't do well. They're intimidated.''
   At Josephinum, there's no graffiti on the walls and the floors
shine like the chrome on a well-polished Chevy.
   ``Register at the Jo,'' a sign reads in the lobby. Students say
they're glad they did.
   Evette Sanchez, an 18-year-old senior, failed her freshman year
at a public school, so she enrolled at Josephinum and started from
scratch.
   ``Since I've been here, my grades are up,'' Miss Sanchez said
Tuesday, the second day of the new academic year. ``Although it's
all girls, it's fun. Teachers in public schools don't care; they
just get paid.''
   Sophomore Patrina Ross, 15, said, ``It's not too large. The
teachers are all concerned. Everyone has friends.''
   A glance at the composite photos of Josephinum graduates
provides proof of the neighborhood's changing face. In the
mid-1960s, when enrollment reached an all-time high of 850, the
school was filled mostly with the daughters of Polish, German and
Ukrainian immigrants.
   Today, those ethnic Eastern Europeans have been replaced by a
student body that is 50 percent black and 37 percent Hispanic, many
of them from families with low incomes and little education.
   About half of this year's students have grants ranging from $100
to $500 to help cover the annual tuition of $1,295. Sister Hawkins
calls them ``work-study scholarships.''
   ``They just don't get money handed to them,'' she said.
``They're assigned to a teacher. They might clean a room, might run
off papers, staple things together.''
   The tough neighborhood, Rescigno says, gives the school the
quality of an oasis.
   ``Many come from very poor backgrounds, problems that we can't
even imagine,'' he said. ``We're like a haven seven or eight hours
a day, especially if your father's a pusher or your mother walks
the street.''
   To keep financially afloat, the school now has a development
director. During the 1986-87 academic year, 670 donors gave
$96,000. A year later, the amount grew to $169,000.
   Kraft Inc. gave $10,000 to help Josephinum produce a music video
that Rescigno will use during his recruiting stops at area
elementary schools _ trips that some day might boost enrollment to
400 students.

   A sluggish cold front dumped heavy rain over portions of the
Southeast today, causing some street flooding, while the northern
half of the nation remained dry.
   The heaviest rain was reported at Columbia, S.C., where more
than 2 inches fell in an hour and a total of 4 inches fell in three
hours.
   Galveston, Texas, also was drenched this morning when 1{ inches
of rain fell in 45 minutes, flooding streets.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included more than 2{ inches in Tampa, Fla., and more than 2 inches
at Savannah, Ga.
   In the Southwest, showers and thunderstorms diminished Tuesday
night. The northern half of the nation was dry this morning.
   Tropical storm Uleki became Hurricane Uleki on Tuesday night.
Uleki was 385 miles south of Hilo, on the island of Hawaii, and was
moving to the west and northwest at 10-15 mph. The present course
will keep the hurricane well to the south of Hawaii.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the eastern Carolinas across Georgia and Florida to the
central Gulf Coast region, and over extreme southern Texas;
scattered showers and thunderstorms from western Texas across the
southern Rockies to the mountains and deserts of southern
California; widely scattered thunderstorms over portions of South
Dakota and Minnesota; smoky skies over Wyoming and southeast
Montana due to forest fires; and mostly sunny skies in the rest of
the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s along portions
of the Pacific Coast, and from the Great Lakes region across the
upper Ohio Valley and the northern and central Appalachians to New
England; in the 90s over the central and southern intermountain
region; between 100 and 110 over the desert Southwest and inland
valleys of California; in the 90s over much of the central and
southern Plains and central Florida; and in the 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 43

<HEAD>Dollar Higher In Modest Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in European trading this morning
after senior Japanese officials said their country is leaving its
base rate unchanged in keeping with international policy
commitments.
   Gold prices fell because of the stronger dollar, dealers said.
   Foreign exchange dealers predicted a relatively quiet session as
the market waits for Friday's release of U.S. unemployment figures.
   Traders in Italy said they expected the dollar to register
further gains against the Japanese yen because of the decision not
to raise interest rates.
   ``It's logical that if interest rates rise in the U.S. and most
of Europe and not in Japan, then the yen has to suffer. The only
surprise is that the effect was delayed,'' said a trader with an
Italian commercial bank in Milan.
   The trader cautioned, however, that the dollar's rise against
the yen could be blocked by profit-taking or fears of intervention
by the Bank of Japan.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.58 yen to a closing 134.97 yen. Later, in
London, it rose to 136.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with the rates late
Tuesday:
   _1.8745 West German marks, up from 1.8678
   _1.5828 Swiss francs, up from 1.5760
   _6.3635 French francs, up from 6.3385
   _2.1180 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1080
   _1,391.60 Italian lire, up from 1,387.50
   _1.2395 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2386
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.683 from $1.691 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $428.00 a troy ounce. At
midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $426.35. Both were down from Tuesday's late
bid of $428.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price for gold was $427.10, down from $428.50
late Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.60 to close at $429.96.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.45 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.55.

   Thieves made off with ``as many furs as they

the store's front window early today, police said.
   The robbers drove the stolen van into the front window of
Antonovich Furs, ``ran into the store and grabbed as many furs as

in a car, said Sgt. Ed Burns, a police spokesman.
   There was no immediate estimate on the value of the furs taken

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared that
Iran's war with Iraq is not over and accused the United States and
the Soviet Union of plotting against the Islamic Republic, Tehran
Radio reported.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, meanwhile, accused
Iraq of seeking to wreck peace talks in Geneva by raising
``unnecessary or out-of-place issues.'' Both men spoke Tuesday.
   In Baghdad, the Al-Thawra daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath
Socialist Party, charged that Iran's insistence it share the vital
Shatt-al-Arab waterway with Iraq was hampering the negotiations.
   It accused Tehran of seeking to string out the talks to ``buy
time'' to rebuild its military forces.
   Iran and Iraq have been observing a cease-fire since Aug. 20.
The war began in September 1980.
   Khomeini's comments came as the Geneva talks under U.N. auspices
were suspended because of differences over troop withdrawals and
Shatt-al-Arab, Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini urged Iranians
to man the front lines in the now-dormant Persian Gulf war, but
also called for a national effort in Iran's post-war reconstruction.
   ``We must take it that we are still at war,'' the 88-year-old
religious patriarch declared.
   He added: ``Our enemy, be it big enemies such as America and the
Soviet Union or their surrogates such as (Iraqi President) Saddam
(Hussein) and others, are constantly plotting because they have
seen how Islam has become a major force in the world. We must never
lose sight of that fact.''
   Iran's state-run television network, also monitored in Nicosia,
showed Khomeini sitting on a sofa at his home in the north Tehran
suburb of Jamaran meeting with President Ali Khamenei, Prime
Minister Hussein Musavi and other senior figures.
   Khomeini noted: ``It is possible that the enemy pretends now
that the problem has been solved. But it's not true. People who are
against us still exist and their numbers are large. We should not
trust anything.''
   Khomeini said that reconstruction of Iran's missile-battered
cities and damaged industrial centers could not be accomplished in
a short time.
   ``They pounded us for eight years and destroyed our cities. We
must persevere so that, God willing, we may be able to do the job
in a few years ... The people should cooperate and bring all their
power to bear on this major issue.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said in a commentary that Baghdad's claim of sovereignty
over the 120-mile Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the southern border
between the two countries before the war, was the main stumbling
block in the Geneva talks.
   The Iraqis have said they consider the 1975 Algiers agreement,
which drew the boundary down the middle of the waterway, as invalid
and claim the frontier should be on the eastern, Iranian, bank.
   Saddam tore up the Algiers document during a television
appearance five days before the Iraqi Army invaded Iran on Sept.
22, 1980.
   Iran insists that the Algiers agreement is still valid.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mayor Edward I. Koch,
invoking Democratic unity in November, moved to set aside bad
feelings stemming from Koch's criticism of the former presidential
candidate in the New York primary.
   The two were scheduled to meet today at the New York City office
of Gov. Mario Cuomo, who arranged the meeting apparently to unify
their support for the Democratic presidential nominee,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   Koch, noting that Dukakis has slipped in the polls since the
Republican convention, said Tuesday, ``We've got to get that surge
back.
   ``In fact, it may very well be that the surge will start with
the meeting that Jesse Jackson and I have tomorrow if we jointly
come out of that meeting united,'' the mayor said. But, he added,
``we have issues that separate us, no question about it.''
   Jackson, during a visit Tuesday to homeless people maintaining a
vigil at City Hall Park, said there would be no discussion at
today's meeting about Koch's strong criticism of him in April's New
York primary.
   Koch strongly endorsed Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee in the
Democratic presidential primary and just as strongly opposed
Jackson, suggesting that Jews would be ``crazy'' to vote for
Jackson because of his support for Palestinian self-determination
in the Middle East. Blacks all over the country reacted with
outrage, as did many Jews.
   On Monday, Jackson said that although the mayor ``operated
beneath the dignity of that office,'' the need for Democratic unity
in November overrode other considerations.

   Athletes who take high doses of steroids may risk
addiction similar to narcotic abuse, doctors warn.
   In a letter in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine,
doctors report a case of steroid dependence in a man who regularly
took four kinds of steroids.
   The 23-year-old body-builder told doctors he could not stop
taking anabolic steroids without experiencing withdrawal symptoms,
depression and disabling fatigue. He said he sometimes felt
uncontrollably violent, paranoid and suicidal.
   After a week off steroids, he told doctors that he couldn't bear
his depression, fatigue and drug craving and intended to resume
taking the drugs.
   ``Some of the clinical features of this patient resemble those
frequently observed in cases of opioid dependence,'' the doctors
wrote.
   The letter was written by Drs. Forest Tennant of Community
Health Projects Medical Group in West Covina, Calif., David L.
Black of Vanderbilt Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Hospital in
Nashville and Robert O. Voy of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
   Other researchers have also pointed out that people who abuse
steroids may suffer hallucinations, delusions, manic episodes and
other temporary mental illness.
   According to one estimate, as many as 1 million athletes in the
United States may be using steroids to build up their muscles. The
drugs retard the tendency of muscle to break down.
   Steroids can also cause a variety of other side effects,
including liver damage, sterility and testicular shrinking.

   President Daniel Ortega announced a
new currency devaluation and wage increases to shore up an economy
he said has been damaged by U.S. support for the Contra rebels.
   Ortega gave few details in a 40-minute speech Tuesday on
state-run radio but said the measures would increase production and
``permit survival while working toward peace in Nicaragua.''
   A source who attended a closed-door meeting in Planning Minister
Alejandro Martinez Cuenca's office after the speech said the
government devalued its currency, the cordoba, from 80 to 180 per
$1 at the official rate.
   The leftist Sandinista government normally conducts its foreign
trade at the official rate.
   Wage hikes range from 60 percent for state agricultural workers
to 35 percent for urban government workers, the source said. The
average worker earned about $16 a month before the raise.
   ``The new exchange rate will stimulate exports, and the salary
adjustments come as the first crops arrive at the markets,'' said
the pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario.
   Ortega said the measures were in line with reforms enacted in
February, when inflation was running at an annual rate of more than
1,300 percent.
   Among those measures, the government issued a new currency
valued at 10 per dollar. In June, it removed most wage and price
controls.
   Ortega also updated the casualty toll to 54,000 in the
seven-year civil war between the Sandinistas and the Contras. He
said that figure included 28,000 dead and damages of $12 billion,
but he did not break down casualties among government forces,
Contras and civilians.
   ``The Nicaraguan people pay a high cost to be able to defend the
revolutionary process,'' he said. ``The economic measures have a
political basis and have to be seen in the revolutionary process,
which has a socialist orientation.''
   Ortega renewed his call for direct talks with the United States,
last held in 1984.
   ``We have insisted on direct talks with the Yankee government to
discuss national security issues, not internal subjects, and we
maintain that position,'' he said.
   The United States has rejected the idea of direct talks with the
Sandinistas, who signed a preliminary cease-fire agreement with the
Contras in March but saw peace talks break off in June.

<HEAD>Civil War, Food Shortages, Flooding Starving Refugees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people are fleeing civil war
and food shortages in the southern Sudan, and many die during the
trek northward or in flood-ravaged refugee camps, an opposition
party said.
   An Irish relief official says millions of people face starvation
in the south.
   A statement issued by the Union of Sudanese African Parties, a
grouping of southern political parties, did not specify how many
people who fled the fierce fighting and famine in the south were
dying.
   ``I would not say by the thousands, but they are dying,'' said a
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anomymity.
   The statement quoted the Bishop of el-Obeid, capital of
Kordofan, 225 miles southwest of Khartoum, as saying people were
flocking by the hundreds every day asking for food and help to
continue their journey northward.
   ``This shows you how the food shortages and the long journey,
which in some cases is done on foot, can kill women, children and
old people,'' the statement said.
   The Rev. Aengus Finucane, director of the Dublin-based aid
agency Concern, called for airlifts of food to regions of the
country made inaccessible by the 5-year-old war.
   ``Two million people are facing death from the ravages of war
and starvation,'' Finucane said at Dublin Airport after returning
from a two-week visit to Khartoum, Sudan's capital.
   Trains carrying thousands of ``living skeletons'' were arriving
in the north every few days, and hundreds of other refugees trekked
on foot to camps, he said.
   About 40 people per day were dying at refugee camps at El
Meriam, 500 miles from Khartoum, said Finucane. His organization
has 34 workers in Sudan.
   In 1983, the Sudan People's Liberation Army _ made up mainly of
Christians and animists _ took up arms against the Moslem majority
government in the north. The SPLA claims to control 90 percent of
the countryside in the south, with the army in command only in the
major cities.
   Fighting between the army and the rebels has forced an estimated
820,000 southerners to leave their crops and cattle behind and seek
shelter around the cities in Sudan and neighboring Ethiopia, where
they become totally dependent on relief food for their livelihood.
   In Khartoum, about 400,000 refugees live in extreme poverty in
tin and canvas shacks around the city. These shantytowns were among
the hardest hit areas in the worst floods in the country's history
this month that sent the Nile River over its banks.
   The floods have left 1.5 million people homeless, at least 91
dead, tens of thousands of homes destroyed and some of Sudan's most
fertile farmland inundated.

   A prankster who specializes in duping the news
media has struck again, inventing a tale of a school for beggars
that was reported by The Miami Herald, New York magazine and the
British Broadcasting Corp.
   The Herald on Sunday published a story about Omar Rockford's
school for panhandlers in New York, where beggars are taught to
trick people out of their money.
   There is no school, the newspaper reported today. Alan Abel,
also known as ``the Happy Hoaxer,'' posed as Omar and got a few
actor friends to play beggar-students.
   ``I do it to shake up the natives,'' Abel, 62, said Tuesday
after confirming the hoax from his home in Westport, Conn.
``Between the latest ax murders and hostages being taken, it
provides levity in the news and a social commentary on the poor.''
   His Omar the beggar scam isn't new. Last year, Abel duped a
Newsday reporter into writing a detailed story about it, with
pictures. The Herald and the BBC heard of Omar in an Aug. 29 cover
story about beggars in New York magazine.
   The Omar School is listed in the telephone book, and someone
purporting to be an answering service took the calls. Abel showed
up for the Herald interview with an array of news clippings about
his top ``graduates.''
   Abel's scams go back to the 1950s with a widely reported bogus
campaign to clothe horses. ``A nude horse is a rude horse,'' he
said.
   He engineered a mass swoon-in on the ``Donahue'' show, a hoax he
later said was sponsored by FAINT _ the Fight Against Idiotic
Neurotic TV.
   He once got The New York Times to run his premature obituary. He
said he ``died'' in Utah while scouting scenes for his horror movie
_ ``Who's Going to Bite Your Neck, My Dear, When All of My Teeth
Are Gone?''

<HEAD>South Africa Says Its Troops Out Of Angola</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   RUNDU, South-West Africa (AP) _ Soldiers dismantled a pontoon
bridge after army trucks carried the last South African troops out
of Angola in an effort to end a 13-year-old civil war.
   Nearly 1,000 South African soldiers, who supported Angola's
anti-Marxist guerrillas, crossed into South-West Africa on Tuesday,
said Lt. Gen. Ian Gleeson, South Africa's army chief of staff.
   The withdrawal completed the first phase of a U.S.-mediated
cease-fire and peace plan aimed at ending the civil war in Angola _
whose Marxist government is backed by thousands of Cuban troops _
and granting independence to South-West Africa, which is controlled
by South Africa.
   ``As of this moment, we are out of Angola,'' Gleeson said at a
ceremony in this town on the Angolan border. He said there had been
no truce violations.
   South African and foreign journalists were flown to Rundu to
witness the pullout of the last South African forces.
   South Africa says it will grant independence to South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia, after Cuba withdraws its troops from
Angola. The Cubans reportedly have offered to leave Angola in 24
months.
   An estimated 2,500 South African troops have gradually retreated
to Namibia after a cease-fire was declared Aug. 8. The troops
supported the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
or UNITA, which controls about one-third of the country.
   The United States mediated peace talks and a cease-fire among
Angola, Cuba and South Africa. UNITA, also backed by the United
States, is not a party to the agreement.
   The four countries involved in the negotiations met last week in
Brazzaville, Congo, but failed to set timetables for withdrawal of
the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola and for Namibian
independence. Another round of talks is planned next week in
Brazzaville.
   Cuban and Angolan officers serving on a cease-fire monitoring
committee watched as soldiers dismantled the bridge across the
Okavango River while villagers washed their clothes nearby.
   The South African trucks crossing into Rundu carried troops and
supplies, and some towed giant G-5 long-range cannons across the
shallow river.
   Many of the vehicles had graffiti scrawled on them, such as ``No
retreat, no surrender'' and ``Hello, mom.'' The troops were greeted
by a banner that read, ``Welcome, winners.''
   Gleeson said South Africa will not conduct any more raids into
Angola in pursuit of guerrillas of the South-West African People's
Organization. He said SWAPO, which has been fighting to end South
African rule over South-West Africa, said it will observe a
cease-fire starting Sept. 1.
   South Africa has intervened in Angola regularly since 1975, when
it invaded the country on the eve of Angolan independence from
Portugal. South African army officers said their maximum strength
in Angola was 3,000 men, although other reports claimed the force
was twice that size during battles in October.

<TEXT>
   A man who killed himself with a pistol
he bought less than a week earlier said in a suicide note ``it's
actually scary'' how easy it is to obtain a handgun in Florida, his
mother says.
   Robert Edward Park, 31, who suffered from depression and had
been disfigured in an auto accident, shot himself in a Marietta,
Ga., hotel last week after mailing the note, dated Aug. 22, to his
mother.
   Park had left his Boca Raton home for Marietta after buying the
gun, said his mother, Elsie Banting.
   Mrs. Banting said Monday she was sure he bought the weapon
within a week of his suicide. She added that showed the need for
gun control.
   ``I'm hoping people will read about the death and pay attention
and get angry,'' she said. ``I think it's terrible.''
   Park was critically injured in a 1984 accident that severed an
ear and broke his jaw in eight places. Reconstructive surgery
helped, but he still was depressed, family members said. He was a
waiter at the time of his death.
   ``I found out very recently how simple it is to buy a gun in
Florida,'' Park wrote, according to his mother. ``It's actually
scary. No wonder the crime rate is so high. This may be an
interesting case for gun control.''
   Last year Florida reduced to two days ``cooling-off'' periods of
up to a few weeks for buying a gun and eliminated other
restrictions on handgun ownership. Critics, including police
agencies, say the change has led to increased violence.
   Clark had been arrested twice for drunken driving and was facing
a court appearance when he disappeared. He also attempted suicide
previously, slashing his wrists with a meat cleaver, said his
brother-in-law, Timothy Babbitt.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis has resurrected the Iran-Contra
scandal as a campaign issue against George Bush, and the
Massachusetts governor's top adviser said today Bush had yet to
explain his role in the arms-for-hostages affair.
   ``His role and participation in Iran-Contra and exchange of arms
with the Ayatollah (Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran) for hostages is a
very serious issue,'' Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas said
on ``CBS This Morning.'' ``He hasn't answered that question.''
   Brountas said ``there's a very serious issue of George Bush's
judgment. When he was supposed to be in charge of fighting the
battle against terrorism ... he apparently endorsed a decision ...
to trade arms with the ayatollah for hostages, which happens to be
one of the most disastrous events in foreign policy history.''
   Dukakis on Tuesday questioned whether Bush's failure to block
the arms deal showed he lacked the judgment to be president.
Dukakis noted that Bush was head of an anti-terrorism task force
that shortly before the 1985 arms deal with Iran issued a report
warning against concessions to terrorist nations.
   The Democratic presidential nominee was spending most of today
at the Massachusetts Statehouse before flying to California for
three days of campaigning in Western states.
   He spent Tuesday in Western Massachusetts on a gubernatorial
trip, but took time to launch his harshest attack on Bush to date
and declare that he was going to respond aggressively to Republican
criticism.
   Dukakis, in a meeting with area editors and later at a news
conference, noted Bush's position as head of an anti-terrorism task
force that shortly before the 1985 arms deal with Iran issued a
report warning against concessions to terrorist nations.
   ``The president and the vice president and a number of other
people, over the opposition of the secretary of state and the
secretary of defense by the way, proceeded to do precisely what
that commission said you should never do,'' Dukakis said.
   ``How can you possibly sit there and do nothing while we traded
arms to a terrorist nation?'' he asked.
   At the news conference, Dukakis cited a new book by Maine Sens.
William Cohen and George Mitchell in which they said the Republican
nominee appeared to have endorsed the arms-for-hostages deal.
   ``Making tough decisions is a test of leadership,'' Dukakis
said. ``George Bush endorsed the decision to sell arms to Iran and
in doing so he failed that test.''
   Cohen, a Republican, and Mitchell, a Democrat, were members of
the congressional Iran-Contra investigating panel. Mitchell was
visiting with Dukakis today.
   Dukakis, asked to respond to Bush's charges that he was too
willing to make concession to the Soviets in arms negotiations,
said the American people should match his record of making tough
decisions with that of the vice president.
   Dukakis mentioned the Iran-Contra affair, the Reagan
administration's dealings with Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega and Bush's support of deposed Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos in the early 1980s.
   ``I would be very concerned about someone with that kind of
judgment negotiating with the Soviet Union,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor also returned Bush's rhetorical
salvos that Dukakis was soft on defense, and reiterated his
opposition to the Star Wars anti-missile system, two new
supercarrier task forces and rail-based MX missiles.
   ``Mr. Bush says he wants them all,'' Dukakis said. ``You can't
have them all, not if you're serious about providing the resources
our conventional forces need and not if you're serious about
getting that deficit down.''
   Dukakis, characterizing Bush as irresponsible on fiscal matters,
mentioned Bush's support of the ``exotic'' weapons systems,
increased education spending, a tax-credit for child care and a $40
billion cut in the capital gains tax.
   ``That is not a responsible approach to the basic fiscal
problems, or for that matter the national security problems, which
face our country,'' the Democratic nominee said.
   Dukakis also lashed out against Bush's record on crime.
   ``What's the Bush record? What's the Dukakis record? I don't
know what the Bush record is,'' Dukakis said. ``It's a blank. On
the rare occasions when the vice president has been asked to do
something on this subject, it's been a failure.''
   Dukakis said he wished the campaign rhetoric was focused more on
major issues but he adopted a more aggressive stance against GOP
attacks, which have included questions about Dukakis' patriotism
and jokes about his height.
   ``If it continues, you have to respond,'' he said. ``I think
that's unfortunate, but I think it's very clear what kind of
campaign the Republicans are running and I think we're going to
have to deal with it.''

<HEAD>ABM Review Ends, US Statement Threatening Action</HEAD>

   The United States said today it was not satisfied
with the Soviet response to its concerns about radar under
construction in Siberia and threatened to take action that could
terminate or suspend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   In a statement issued at the close of a one-week conference
reviewing the ABM treaty, the U.S. delegation said ``the Soviet
Union gave no indication that it was prepared to correct'' its
violations of the treaty ``without linking their agreement to do so
to unacceptable demands.''
   The statement also made plain that the U.S. side now links
dismantling of the Krasnoyarsk radar to agreement in other arms
control negotiations in Geneva.
   ``The United States has also made clear that the continuing
existence of the Krasnoyarsk radar makes it impossible to conclude
any future arms agreements'' in separate negotiations on reducing
intercontinental nuclear forces, known as the START talks, and on
space and defense systems, it said.
   The Soviet Union did not immediately issue its own statement,
and the Soviet diplomatic mission said a spokesman was not
immediately available.
   The U.S. statement referred to the radar under construction at
Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, which the United States has long
maintained constitutes a violation of the ABM treaty because it is
not situated at the edge of the country, pointed outward, as the
treaty stipulates such a radar must be.
   The statement said the United States has observed a slowdown in
construction of the radar, but insists the radar must be dismantled.
   The statement said that the violation ``is very serious,
especially when it is recognized that the radar constitutes one of
a network of such radars'' that have the potential to support
ballistic missile defenses.
   The U.S. side also raised the issue of Soviet deployment last
year of two other radars in Gomel, near Kiev, the statement said.
   The ABM treaty limits each side to deploying one ABM system
comprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles and constrains
radars for early warning which could, because of their location,
orientation and capability, contribute to an ABM defense.
   The aim is to prevent either side from creating a full,
country-wide protective network, under the theory that neither side
would launch a nuclear attack if it feared devastating retaliation.
   The Soviet Union has an ABM system deployed around Moscow. The
United States has not deployed one.
   The U.S. statement called the radar a material breach of the
treaty and said the United States ``reserves all its rights,
consistent with international law, to take appropriate and
proportionate responses in the future.''
   The statement did not elaborate on what those responses might
be. But an information sheet distributed last week by the U.S.
mission says that according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, if one party charges ``material breach,'' it is entitled
to invoke the breach ``as a ground for terminating the treaty or
suspending its operation in whole or in part.''
   Such action would apparently free the United States to conduct
uninhibited research and deployment of its Strategic Defense
Initiative, currently in the research stage, which aims at creating
a space-based missile defense.
   The Soviet Union has charged that some SDI research violates the
ABM treaty, but in its public statements has not specified where it
draws the line.
   Both sides link compliance with the ABM treaty to progress at
other arms control negotiations under way in Geneva.
   The Soviet Union has long made agreement on limiting SDI
research a precondition for a START agreement. The United States
has rejected such a linkage.
   The START talks have been going on in Geneva since March 1985.
The two sides have agreed in principle on reducing their forces by
50 percent, but many issues remain to be resolved.

   The simulated failure of space
shuttle Discovery's right engine forced astronauts to shift their
craft into a low orbit as part of a final rehearsal for the first
post-Challenger mission.
   The 56-hour simulation began Tuesday and involved about 300
people at Johnson Space Center.
   ``The first thing after launch, when they were going into orbit,
the right engine failed so that they had to do what's called `abort
to orbit,''' NASA spokeswoman Barbara Selby said.
   ``That means the shuttle can still make it into orbit, but lower
than planned, so they have to adjust their activities,'' Ms. Selby
said. ``They did achieve the ATO, as we call it, and made the
necessary adjustments to continue the mission.''
   The shuttle crew faced another problem later Tuesday when they
tried to deploy the $100 million communications satellite.
   A tilt table used to deploy the satellite stuck at a 24-degree
angle. Two crewmen were to go outside the orbiter today to manually
adjust the table to the needed 50-degree angle, Ms. Selby said.
That simulation was to take place under water.
   Discovery's four-day mission will be the first shuttle flight
since the Challenger explosion 2{ years ago.
   Commander Rick Hauck, pilot Richard Covey and mission
specialists David Hilmers, Mike Lounge and George ``Pinky'' Nelson
are expected to face about 150 simulated problems during the test,
which is to be completed Thursday evening.
   As many as 200 others are taking part in the rehearsal in New
Mexico and California, spokesman Brian Welch said.
   The launch of Discovery is slated for late September or early
October, if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen leak are repaired
in time.

   A con man accused of posing as the son of a
Time Inc. executive to get a hotel room and VIP treatment was
sentenced to three years in prison.
   ``Most of the criminals I've dealt with are stupid, but not this
guy,'' Assistant District Attorney Jim Costello said of 29-year-old
David Lee Geiken of Gothenburg, Neb. ``He showed real brains and
intelligence.''
   Geiken accepted a plea bargain in which he pleaded guilty to
defrauding an innkeeper.
   Geiken told the San Francisco Chronicle he was in Los Angeles in
May when he decided on conning the magazine. He said a telephone
call to a Time Inc. operator provided him with the name of chairman
J. Richard Munro.
   He phoned Time offices in San Francisco and said Munro's son
needed a plane ticket from Los Angeles to San Francisco, spending
money and ``a nice room.''
   He received the ticket, a room at an elegant hotel and $400 in
cash. A chauffered limousine was waiting when he arrived in San
Francisco.
   Geiken served more than four years in prison for obtaining a
yacht and crew by pretending to be the son of the chief executive
of 20th Century Studios.

   The first contestant in this year's Miss
America Pageant arrived in Atlantic City this morning with about 20
pieces of luggage.
   ``Last week I reported that I'd only have eight,'' Miss New York
Mia Seminoff said with a grin.
   The 23-year-old Manhattan resident arrived on a small plane at
the Atlantic City Airport here at 7:30 a.m. Five pageant hostesses
fought off yawns while waiting to greet her.
   ``This is the earliest I ever remember anyone arriving,'' said
hostess Millie Frambe.
   Miss Seminoff said the early arrival hour made sense. ``Now we
have the day in front of us to settle down and try to relax,'' she
said.
   Miss Seminoff was the first of 51 women who will arrive
Wednesday and Thursday in the seaside resort to compete for the
title of Miss America on Sept. 10.
   The contestants are arriving earlier than usual this year to
rehearse a more elaborate production number, pageant director
Leonard Horn said.
   Despite the early hour, Miss Seminoff happily posed for
photographers. When she realized that one button on her navy blue
and white linen dress had become undone, she quickly placed one
hand over the button hole and waved with the other.

<HEAD>Vietnam To Resume Joint Search For Missing Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES W. HATTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam told the United States it is
willing to resume joint searches for American servicemen missing in
the Vietnam War.
   The decision was revealed in an Aug. 27 letter from Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach to retired Gen. John W. Vessey, a special
U.S. presidential envoy. A text of the letter, carried Tuesday by
Radio Hanoi, was seen today in Bangkok.
   Thach told Vessey in an Aug. 3 letter that Vietnam was
temporarily suspending full cooperation because of what he called
America's ``hostile policy'' toward Vietnam. Thach cited Assistant
Secretary of State Gaston Sigur's testimony before a congressional
committee in July in which Sigur urged the continued isolation of
Vietnam.
   Vessey, President Reagan's envoy on humanitarian issues relating
to Vietnam, replied to Thach two days later that Sigur's testimony
merely reflected the U.S. administration's ``longstanding viewpoint
on relations with Vietnam.''
   He said the United States would continue implementing previous
agreements with Vietnam and its humanitarian aid.
   Thach replied in his Aug. 27 letter that the U.S. ``declaration
that it will make the normalization of bilateral relations
conditional upon the settlement of the MIA issues is at variance
with the agreement between ... (Vessey) and myself.''
   But he said settlement of humanitarian issues ``should be
separated from political issues.''
   ``With the desire that the U.S. government will adopt a suitable
attitude ... the Vietnamese side agrees to let the U.S. side
participate in joint investigation and survey activities as
concerns the issue of American MIAs and is prepared to hold
meetings of specialists from the two sides to discuss specific
plans from 9 to 12 September 1988,'' Thach wrote.
   Thach and Vessey agreed in August 1987 that Vietnam would
accelerate its accounting of nearly 1,800 Americans listed as
missing in action, or MIA, in the Vietnam War, and the United
States would give Vietnam humanitarian aid.
   Thach told Vessey in July that Vietnam would try to resolve 70
top priority MIA cases by the end of this year, and welcomed joint
excavations and other searches for remains until October. There
have been no joint excavations since the first was conducted in
late 1985.

   An explosion early today
shattered a six-story office building used by church and
anti-apartheid groups, and police said 23 people were injured. The
structure was declared unsafe for further use.
   The type of explosive, which was believed planted in the
basement parking garage, and the identity of the bombers were not
known, police said.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu blamed the attack on ``the
perpetrators or supporters of apartheid.''
   The injured included passersby, residents of nearby apartment
buildings, and employees of the South African Council of Churches,
the main occupant of the Khotso House, which means House of Peace
in the Zulu language. Several nearby shops and apartment buildings
also were heavily damaged.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the council, said
the blast destroyed the council's fleet of cars parked in a
basement garage. He said police barred workers of Khotso House from
entering the building and expressed concern the council's files
might be searched.
   It was the second explosion to wreck the Johannesburg
headquarters of anti-apartheid groups. Last year, the offices of
the main black labor federation, the Congress of South African
Trade Unions, and several of its affiliates was severely damaged.
   The union congress described today's bombing as part of a
``continuous campaign against the opponents of apartheid'' and said
it had heard nothing from police about investigations of the 1987
blast at its headquarters.
   Khotso House serves as headquarters for the council of churches
and the Black Sash civil rights group, two of the most prominent
anti-apartheid organizations that so far have remained affected by
government bans.
   Several other church and human rights groups have offices in the
building, and it housed offices of the United Democratic Front
before the nationwide coalition and 17 other groups were banned in
February.
   The church council _ which represents most major Protestant
denominations except the Afrikaner-oriented Dutch Reformed Church _
has taken a lead role in the anti-apartheid movement since the
bannings.
   Tutu, a leader of the church council and winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid campaigning, said the
bombing ``represents a new low in the behavior of those who seek to
destroy the witness of the church against the evil and unchristian
policies of the South African government.''
   Chikane said, ``The darkest forces of evil are arranging
themselves against the church ... but we intend to continue telling
the truth.''
   A fire set off after the blast destroyed gas pipes in the
basement. The floor of the main lobby collapsed into the basement,
and a section of the facade was blasted open, strewing rubble into
the street.
   City engineers and fire officials visited the building after the
explosion at 1:10 a.m. and declared it unsafe for further
occupation.
   The Rev. Peter Storey, a Methodist minister who formerly was
president of the church council, called the bombing a ``bestial
act.''
   Storey later joined Chikane at a news conference at a nearby
Methodist church and told journalists the church office had
received a telephoned bomb threat moments earlier.
   Last year, there was a series of unsolved bombings and arson
attacks on offices of anti-apartheid groups and militant black
labor unions. Activists suggested the attacks were carried out by
right-wing vigilantes, either within or outside the security forces.
   This year, several restaurants and other civilian targets have
been bombed. Authorities have blamed the attacks on the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement, which seeks to topple
the white-minority government.
   Under apartheid, the nation's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.

   A 32-year-old political newcomer has won the
Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Rep. George ``Buddy''
Darden for a northwestern Georgia seat, while two state legislators
lost runoff elections.
   Cobb County businessman Robert Lamutt defeated Roswell planner
Kevin Johns for the GOP nod to run against Darden in the 7th
District, which includes Atlanta's northwestern suburbs, in
November. Darden was unopposed in Tuesday's primary.
   The unofficial vote, with returns from all 207 precincts was:
Lamutt, 6,220 votes, or 52 percent; Johns, 5,691 votes, or 48
percent.
   State Rep. Ken Workman, a DeKalb County Democrat, lost 938-864
to Decatur lawyer Thurbert Baker, according to unofficial results.
It was Workman's first bid for re-election following charges, later
dropped, that he beat his wife. Baker faces Republican Hugh Wright
in November.
   Another incumbent, freshman state Rep. Ron Pittman, a Gwinnett
County Republican, lost to businessman Keith Breedlove 1,261 to
1,142, according to unofficial results. Breedlove will take on
Democrat Pat Brown in November.
   A Fulton County legislative race raised the possibility of a
father-daughter pairing in the Georgia House.
   Cynthia Ann McKinney, daughter of Rep. Billy McKinney, defeated
AFL-CIO state President Herb Mabry. The unofficial vote, in returns
from all but one of 281 precincts: Ms. McKinney, 15,163, or 53
percent; Mabry, 13,509, or 47 percent.
   In the only statewide runoff on Tuesday's ballot, former state
Sen. Bobby Rowan captured the Democratic nomination for a seat on
Georgia's utility-regulating Public Service Commission despite
Election Day reports that Georgia Power Co. managers were pressured
to contribute to his campaign.
   Rowan defeated state Rep. Cathey Steinberg.

   A man scheduled to die early today for
murdering a police officer received an 11th-hour reprieve because
his death warrant may have have been lost in the mail, officials
said.
   Ramon Montoya was granted the stay Tuesday by State District
Judge Tom Price of Dallas. The reprieve would last until Dec. 1,
said Ron Dusek, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office.
   The warrant for Montoya to receive a lethal injection today was
signed in court July 21 and mailed to prison officials, the Dallas
County district attorney's office said.
   State prison officials, however, said they never received it.
   ``I wasn't even aware there was a warrant,'' said David
Nunnelee, spokesman for the Texas Department of Corrections.
Executions are carried out by prison officials on orders from court.
   The stay was issued on the grounds that attorneys for Montoya
needed more to time to prepare motions and that the judge wanted to
review the case further because of the confusion surrounding the
missing warrant, Dusek said.
   Montoya, 35, was convicted of capital murder in the shooting
death of Dallas police officer John Pasco on Jan. 16, 1983.
   Pasco, 27, an 18-month veteran of the force, was shot in the
head while chasing Montoya through an apartment complex. Montoya
had said he fell during the chase and his gun fired while he was
attempting to throw the weapon away.
   The Mexican national had earlier been deported on a weapons
charge but had re-entered the country illegally, U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization officials said.

<HEAD>Iraq Attacking Kurdish Guerrillas With Troops And Poison Gas,
Kurds Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iraq attacked Kurdish guerrillas in
northern Iraq with at least 60,000 troops backed by fighter-bombers
and helicopter gunships dropping poison gas, a Kurdish spokesman
said today.
   ``Heavy fighting is taking place between our forces and the
Iraqi army on all fronts'' in the mountains of northeast Iraq, the
official of the Kurdish Democratic Party said in a telephone
interview.
   He said the ``unprecedented'' Iraqi offensive, in which villages
have been burned to the ground, was launched Monday all across the
4,000 square miles of Kurdish-held Iraqi territory.
   ``The army is deploying at least 60,000 troops, with tanks,
aircraft, helicopter gunships, artillery and chemical weapons,'' he
said. ``The army is burning down villages and killing people on
sight and leaving carnage behind.'' The official, based in a West
European capital, spoke on condition of anonymity for ``security
reasons.''
   There was no way to confirm the report independently. But
Kurdish guerrilla groups have been bracing for an all-out Iraqi
offensive for several weeks.
   The spokesman said casualty reports were sketchy because radio
contact with the Kurdish stronghold south of the Turkish border was
difficult.
   But he said Kurdish guerrillas destroyed Iraq's 66th special
forces brigade, killing at least 400 men in the mountainous Sidikan
region on Monday.
   He said 54 guerrillas and more than 100 Kurdish civilians were
killed and that the Iraqis suffered ``heavy losses.''
   The official said the Iraqi forces comprised the northern-based
1st and 5th army corps reinforced with units of the elite
Presidential Guard, special forces and the 7th army corps normally
based in the south.
   He said the Kurds had about 15,000 guerrillas backed by about
30,000 reservists.
   Diplomats in Baghdad said Iraq has taken advantage of the Aug.
20 cease-fire in the eight-year war with Iran to intensify
operations against the Kurds, who seek autonomy and who sided with
the Iranians.
   Turkey, which is fighting its own Kurdish rebels, has allowed
civilians fleeing the fighting into its territory on humanitarian
grounds after appeals from Kurdish Democratic Party leader Massoud
Barzani, officials in Ankara said today.
   The party spokesman said Turkey has announced that it will
accept 30,000 refugees and that ``several thousand'' already have
crossed into Turkey.
   He said the brunt of the Iraqi assault was aimed at rebel
strongholds in Zakho, Dahok, Mosul and Erbil provinces.
   Iraqi jets dropped poison gas bombs, outlawed under a 1925
Geneva treaty, on villages and guerrilla positions in the Zakho
region Monday and Tuesday, he said.
   It was not immediately known how many died from the gas attacks.
But Barzani said 500 people were killed and 3,000 wounded in
chemical attacks this month in the buildup to the offensive.
   The spokesman said: ``We have no gas masks, protective clothing,
or antidotes for the chemical weapons. It's causing panic among the
population.''
   About 20 million Kurds live in the mountains where the Turkish,
Iraqi and Iranian borders meet. Syria and the Soviet Union also
have Kurdish enclaves.
   Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have waged a sporadic war for an
autonomous homeland for 50 years.
   Sources in Baghdad said Nuzhei Kandemir, undersecratry of
Turkey's Foreign Ministry, flew to the Iraqi capital Monday and
complained about the use of chemical weapons on the Turkish border.
   Kurdish and Iranian officials said more than 50 villages were
hit by gas attacks in recent weeks.
   Iraq has admitted using chemical weapons during the war with
Iran, but said Iran used them first. Tehran denied that. The U.N.
Security Council has blamed Iraq for gas attacks on Iran several
times.
   The Kurds said 5,000 of their civilians were killed in March in
gas attacks on Halabja, when it was captured by rebels aided by
Iranian fighters.
   Foreign reporters taken to Halabja by the Iranians saw the
bodies of hundreds of men, women and children sprawled around the
town, unmarked by shrapnel or bullet wounds.

   Three American servicemen and an
Italian soldier burned during an air show crash in West Germany
that killed 49 arrived here today in critical condition, officials
said.
   The four were taken off a C-141 cargo plane at Kelly Air Force
Base after a flight from Ramstein, West Germany. They were taken to
the burn unit at Brooke Army Medical Center.
   Today in Landstuhl, West Germany, an American couple and their
2-year-old-son were put on a flight to Kelly for treatment of burns
and other injuries suffered in the air show crash, an Army
spokeswoman said.
   Jeffrey McCanch, his wife, Tammy, and their son, Jeffrey Jr.,
had been undergoing treatment at Landstuhl Army hospital. The boy
was in serious condition, but the parents were in good condition,
spokeswoman Marie Shaw said.
   Ms. Shaw did not know the McCanch's hometown.
   The four who arrived early today suffered second- and
third-degree burns and would be listed in critical condition until
their injuries could be assessed by specialists, said Ray Dery, a
Brooke spokesman.
   The four were identified as Air Force Master Sgt. Stephen Hull,
32, stationed at Kelly Air Force Base; Army 1st Lt. Kim Strader,
30, of Salt Lake City; and Army Pfc. Myron Riggs, 24, of
Pittsburgh; and Anderea DelaRosa, 33, a sergeant major.
   Hull, of Covina, Calif., is assigned to the Air Force
Broadcasting Service, and was in West Germany as part of a tour
visiting broadcasting units in Europe, said Kelly spokeswoman Phebe
Brown.
   The victims were among the hundreds injured Sunday when three
Italian jets crashed during an air show at Ramstein Air Force Base.
   On Monday, a five-member team of burn specialists from Brooke
flew to West Germany to help treat the victims, and decided to
bring the four to the United States.
   The 40-bed burn unit at Brooke is staffed by 240 physicians,
nurses and support personnel.
   Sailors injured during attacks in the Persian Gulf during the
last 15 months were among those treated at the center, which is run
by the Army Institute of Surgical Research.

<HEAD>Pilots Union Chief Says Eastern Sought To Break Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' stalled plan to lay off
4,000 workers is part of a broader Eastern effort to ``break the
unions'' and gradually dismember the airline, the president of the
Air Line Pilots Association charged today.
   Henry Duffy, whose group represents most unionized U.S. pilots,
expressed satisfaction with a federal judge's ruling Tuesday
blocking Eastern from carrying out the layoffs.
   The financially strapped carrier said it would file an emergency
appeal of the ruling.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker also ruled that Eastern
could go ahead with plans to eliminate service to 14 cities and
close its Kansas City, Mo., hub.
   ``It's an important decision because what the judge found was a
series of transactions that Eastern has been going through (that)
hasn't been for legitimate business purposes,'' Duffy said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``It's been to break the unions.''
   NBC said Eastern declined an invitation to appear with Duffy on
the program.
   On Tuesday the Miami-based carrier issued a statement by its
president, Phil Bakes, calling the court ruling ``gravely wrong''
and saying it would appeal on grounds that any business must be
allowed to ``prune money-losing operations.''
   ``We must be able to take prudent, although sometimes painful,
measures in the best interests of the company and our employees,''
Bakes said.
   Asked if his union believed Eastern's cutbacks in service and
proposed layoffs were aimed at eventually doing away with the
airline altogether, Duffy said:
   ``As a matter of fact, that's what the judge found. He found
they've been siphoning assets off and transferring them over to
Continental (Airlines).''
   Both Eastern and Continental are subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp.
   In his ruling, Parker wrote that Texas Air, which bought Eastern
in 1986, ``has exerted every effort to curb union influence at
Eastern ...'' He also wrote that Eastern's management had
contributed to the carrier's financial instability through a series
of decisions that led to ``a number of questionable loans and
questionable ventures.''

<HEAD>Continental Cockpit Banter Violated FAA Regulations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banter between the pilots of a Continental jet
before it crashed Nov. 15, killing 28 people, apparently violated
federal regulations, officials say.
   A previously undisclosed portion of the ``black box'' cockpit
recording from the DC-9 shows that in the minutes before Flight
1713 crashed, the pilots discussed the dating habits of a woman
flight attendant and other matters unrelated to the flight.
   The tape shows the pilots did not discuss the snow falling at
Stapleton International Airport.
   Both pilots, flight captain Frank Zvonek and co-pilot Lee Edward
Bruecher, were killed in the crash. Fifty-four people were injured.
   A Federal Aviation Administration rule known as the ``sterile
cockpit concept'' prohibits non-essential conversation in the
cockpit during ground operations and takeoff preparations.
   FAA spokesman Dick Meyer said a pilot who violated the rule
could be suspended or fined as much as $10,000.
   ``That would definitely be extraneous,'' Meyer said Tuesday of
the discussions between the two pilots. ``The main point is the
cockpit crew is supposed to be concentrating on their primary
business of flying the airplane. Distractions can be deadly.''
   The FAA enacted the regulation in the late 1970s or early 1980s
after ``several instances where we found in accidents where flight
crews were talking about something other than flying the
airplane,'' FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said.
   Continental spokesman Bruce Hicks said non-pertinent
conversations are common among pilots. ``If the pilots on 1713 were
in violation of that reg, 99.9 percent of all commercial pilots in
history have violated that reg,'' he said.
   Hicks had said previously that the pilots maintained a ``highly
skilled, well-disciplined professional cockpit.''
   The pilots' conversation has become an issue as the National
Transportation Safety Board studies possible causes of the
accident, which occurred in a snowstorm.
   Mel Hoagland, who retired as a United Airlines DC-10 captain
this month, said such cockpit conversations aren't unusual. ``You
can't just sit and be keyed right on the edge of the aviation
experiences all of the time,'' he said.
   Ed Arbon, vice president of the Flight Safety Foundation of
Arlington, Va., said that unless pilots anticipate a waiting
period, it is unusual for them to spend much time discussing
non-flight matters in a plane prpearing to take off in snow.
   ``If the weather's of concern, usually your attention is taken
up by the business at hand,'' he said.
   The NTSB is to meet next month to review the accident. The board
is studying whether ice or snow buildup on the wings, the
experience and training of the pilots and possible turbulence from
another aircraft caused the crash.

<HEAD>Soviets Confirm Sending Fighter Jets Into Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government spokesman today confirmed that
Soviet-based fighter aircraft were used recently to aid Afghan
ground troops as they battled for control of the northern
Afghanistan city of Kunduz.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov denied, however,
a U.S. charge that the action violated the Geneva accords on an
Afghan settlement.
   He told reporters at a regular briefing that the Kremlin
responded to an ``urgent situation'' when it sent the aircraft.
   Gerasimov denied another U.S. allegation that the Kremlin had
sent troops back to Kunduz, about 30 miles from the Soviet border,
after recently withdrawing them.
   Under the Geneva accords signed earlier this year, the Soviets
have pulled out half of their 100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan
since May 15, and the remainder is scheduled to be withdrawn by
Feb. 15.
   Phyllis Oakley, U.S. State Department spokeswoman, said earlier
this week that the Soviets had directed aircraft into Afghanistan
and moved some Red Army troops into Kunduz from elsewhere within
the country. She said the dispatch of aircraft from the Soviet
Union was a violation of the Geneva accords.
   Gerasimov said the dispatch of aircraft was justified.
   ``When the Soviet troops left and part of the troops were still
there, counterrevolutionary, anti-governmental gangs began to
operate, so countermeasures were required,'' he said.
   He said he could not give specifics of the operations, declining
to say how many fighters were dispatched to the area and whether
the aircraft carried out any bombing. But he said the aircraft were
there mainly as support.
   Gerasimov did not respond directly when asked whether the Afghan
government requested the assistance, or whether the Soviets
volunteered it.
   ``When in the area around Kunduz, a critical situation emerged,
then with the consent of the Afghan government, aircraft were used
from Soviet territory for rendering urgent support including a
Soviet unit fighting counterrevolutionary formations,'' Gerasimov
said.
   The Soviets have persistently accused Pakistan of violating the
Geneva accords.
   The spokesman today reinterated the list of Soviet complaints,
accusing Pakistan of permitting guerrillas to operate bases inside
the Pakistani border and blaming the United States for its
involvement.
   ``Nothing of this kind would have happened had Pakistan, with
the support of the United States, not supplied arms to the rebels,
including advisers,'' he said.
   The United States has said it will continue supplying Pakistan
with weapons for the rebels as long as the Soviets continue arming
the Kabul government.
   Gerasimov said the rebels conducted a bloody fight in and around
Kunduz.
   ``They burned down three hospitals; they destroyed all
governmental institutions, they destroyed several mosques, those
freedom fighters. They blew up the power supply station, so Kunduz
remained without electric power. They killed officials, including
members of their family. They killed traders, merchants and they
took 200 schoolgirls and college students and away from Kunduz,''
Gerasimov said.
   Rebel commanders have said their strategy is to take the
provincial seats before an assault on Kabul, the capital.

   Secretary of Education William Bennett said
today that American school children get off to a good start but
start falling behind their foreign counterparts in fourth grade.
   Bennett, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said,
``There's something very real called the fourth grade slump. Our
schools seem to do a pretty good job up to grade three.''
   The problems continue ``right through twelfth grade,'' said
Bennett. ``The longer you stay in school in America, the further
you fall behind your counterparts from other countries.''
   Bennett, who leaves office in three weeks, released a model
elementary school curriculum Tuesday that calls for a rigorous
course of study for all children in kindergarten through eighth
grade, including foreign languages, literary classics, pre-algebra
or algebra and introductory science courses.

<HEAD>CPAs Vote to Drop Ethics Ban on Accepting Commissions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under pressure from the Federal Trade Commission,
the nation's largest organization of certified public accountants
lifted its 82-year-old ban on CPAs' accepting certain fees and
commissions.
   The ruling council of the 272,000-member American Institute of
Certified Pubic Accountants voted 191-5 Tuesday to drop the
prohibition against compensation for non-audit financial planning
services.
   The ban was intended to avoid conflicts of interest among
accountants, but officials said that dropping the restriction will
benefit the consumer by allowing CPAs to compete against bankers
and stockbrokers.
   ``We've been working on this change for five years, and we're
just delighted that it occurred,'' said H.D. Vest, an Irving,
Texas, accountant who threatened to sue the institute if it didn't
drop the ban.
   The FTC last year issued a letter of complaint against the CPA
group, threatening legal action unless it allowed accountants to
accept commissions for non-audit work. The FTC contended the ban
violated antitrust law.
   The FTC said the ban effectively prevented CPAs from competing
in the financial services market. Since they could not accept
commissions, they had no incentive to provide the services.
   Under the ban, accountants in most states could take no part in
financial planning.
   ``(The change) allows consumers to go to one person who knows
their situation best, and that one person, the CPA, will make the
recommendation,'' Vest said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   Vest said consumers will benefit most from the change because it
will allow them to get business done ``under one roof.''
   Licensing authority is actually held by the individual states,
but the institute's code of ethics serves as a model for many state
regulatory boards.
   The FTC had no immediate comment on the vote, said a woman at
the commission's Washington offices who did not give her name.
   Critics of the change focused on the conflict of interest issue,
saying accountants could give biased advice to get a bigger fee,
Vest said.
   The institute's policy change allows accountants to earn
commissions in several areas, such as helping clients obtain loans,
make acquisitions or mergers and devise cost-cutting plans, Vest
said.
   Five states _ Maryland, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and West
Virginia _ already allow such commissions.
   The National Association of State Boards of Accountancy, whose
members regulate CPAs, is expected to vote on a similar measure on
Sept. 28.

<HEAD>Shiites Rally, Stage Strike To Mark Disappearance of Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bursts of gunfire resounded in Beirut's
southern suburbs today as Shiite Moslem factions rallied to mark
the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of their spiritual
leader, Imam Mousa Sadr.
   A daylong general strike also was observed to mark the occasion.
   In a separate development, acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, an
American-educated, moderate politician, was rushed to the American
University Hospital in west Beirut after a severe asthma attack.
   Gunmen of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, dashed
out of the Bir el-Abed mosque where they were holding their rally
as the firing began.
   They ordered reporters to leave the district.
   Syrian troops manning checkpoints around the mosque said the
firing came from another neighborhood, five blocks to the west. The
mainstream Shiite Amal faction was holding a separate rally in that
area.
   ``Some militiamen fired their automatic rifles in the air,'' a
Syrian officer who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters.
``We are searching the area for them.''
   No casualties were reported.
   Government offices, banks, shops, restaurants and other
businesses were closed in west Beirut and other towns and cities in
south and east Lebanon as the Shiites observed the strike.
   The stoppage was called by Amal, which was founded by Sadr in
1974 as a social movement seeking better living conditions for the
downtrodden Shiite community.
   The group took up arms a year later, when the Christian-Moslem
civil war broke out.
   Sadr, who also headed the Supreme Shiite Islamic Council,
vanished on Aug. 31, 1978, while on visit to Libya. Libyan
authorities said he left for Rome, but Italian authorities denied
he ever landed in Italy.
   Amal has accused the Libyans of holding Sadr.
   The Islamic Amal, another Iranian-backed militia based in east
Lebanon, sponsored a third rally in the city of Baalbek. There were
no reports of any problems there.
   The 1.2 million Shiites form the largest single sect in Lebanon,
and their three militant groups are divided mainly over regional
alliances and local politics.
   Amal, headed by Justice Minister Nabih Berri, is seeking
Christian-Moslem coexistence in Lebanon on the basis of political
reforms distributing power equally between the two communities. The
other two advocate the establishment of an Iran-style Islamic
republic.
   Hezbollah also is believed to be an umbrella for underground
factions who hold most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   Hoss was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit and was
recovering quickly, an attending doctor said.
   The Sunni Moslem became acting prime minister in June 1987, when
Prime Minister Rashid Karami was killed in a helicopter explosion.
   Hoss was scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday to
elaborate on a political deadlock that has prevented the election
of a new Lebanese president.
   President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expires on Sept. 23 and
he cannot run for another term.
   Christian parliament members boycotted an Aug. 18 election
session because the only candidate was former President Suleiman
Franjieh, a Maronite Catholic who is a staunch ally of Syria.
   Christian militias, backed by Israel, are violently opposed to
Syria.
   Under an unwritten 1943 ``national covenant,'' the president
must be a Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the
parliament speaker a Shiite.

   A Chinese jetliner with 89 people aboard
skidded off a runway while landing in heavy rain today and broke
apart in the sea. Officials said seven people were killed,
including six crew members trapped in the submerged nose section.
   Fifteen people were reported injured, and 13 of them were
hospitalized in fair or satisfactory condition. The airline said
two of 12 Americans on board were injured.
   A rescue operation at Hong Kong's airport involving divers, a
flotilla of boats and five helicopters began after Flight 301
plunged into Victoria Harbor at 9:19 a.m. Later in the day, a huge
floating crane lifted the crumpled jetliner from the water, and an
investigation into the crash began.
   The bodies of the six crew members were found in the front part
of the plane, according to Tsui Hin-cheuk, divisional commander of
the fire services department.
   Officials said a passenger, a Hong Kong resident identified only
by his surname Fung, died of head injuries.
   Earlier, small rubber rafts with rescue personnel bobbed around
the partially submerged wreckage of the British-made Trident jet,
which had arrived from Canton, capital of China's Guangdong
province 90 miles to the northwest.
   Fire engines crowded onto Kai Tak Airport's solitary runway,
which juts into the harbor. ``It fell into the sea at the end of
the runway,'' police spokesman Tony Leung said of the jetliner.
   Tsui Hin-Cheuk, one of those overseeing the search and rescue
operation, told reporters the six who died were trapped in the
plane's nose section, which was submerged in shallow water just off
the end of the runway.
   The plane, carrying an 11-member Chinese crew, is owned by the
Civil Aviation Administration of China, that nation's flag-carrier.
   Tsui said one of the plane's engines was on fire when rescue
workers arrived, but he did not elaborate.
   Government-run Radio Television Hong Kong interviewed one
unidentified passenger who said some of the plane's safety belts
did not work.
   ``That's why when the plane landed so hard, people simply were
flying,'' the woman told the station. ``I was in the back. It
didn't dawn on me that we were really out of control. I was
thinking more of ... how I was going to get out.''
   Kiyotaka Fukasawa, a 60-year-old Japanese passenger, told
reporters that as soon as the plane hit the water, a flight
attendant opened an emergency door so passengers could scramble out
onto the wing and wait for rescue crews.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said bad weather caused the
crash. Airline spokesman Chen Zhengyou, when asked about the cause,
said only, ``You know, today the weather is not very good.''
   Heavy showers reduced visibility for much of the morning.
   The nationalities of most of the injured were not known. The
airline did not release a passenger list from the plane, which can
carry up to 100 people.
   Hospital officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
identified two of the injured as Heung Cheuk-Wu, a 38-year-old
Chinese-American, and Jean Allegre of France.
   The airline said the uninjured included 10 Americans, 12
Japanese, 10 Chinese, 10 Hong Kong Chinese, and nationals from
Taiwan, Indonesia, Finland, France, New Zealand, Switzerland,
Germany, Great Britain, the Philippines and Singapore.
   All incoming and outgoing flights at Kai Tak, a major
transportation hub for Southeast Asia, were delayed for nearly
seven hours after the crash.
   It was the worst airline crash at Kai Tak since 1967, when a
Thai International flight crashed into the harbor, killing 24 of 73
people on board.
   Two cargo planes have crashed at Kai Tak since, but no one was
killed in those accidents.

   Authorities said today they
caught two suspected Irish Republican Army members as they tried to
cross the border from the Netherlands with weapons.
   Suspected IRA guerrillas have carried out several attacks
against British Army bases in West Germany over the past few months.
   In the last such attack, a bomb exploded at a British forces
army barracks in Duesseldorf on Aug. 5. Five people were injured.
   ``There are grounds to believe that they belong to the IRA,''
chief federal prosecutor spokesman Alexander Prechtel told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview. ``An investigation is
now under way,'' Prechtel said.
   Suedwestfunk Radio in Stuttgart reported earlier that the two
men caught late Tuesday night carried a load of guns and
explosives. The officials, however, said they could not confirm
that the men had explosives.
   ``Two rifles and two pistols were found in the suspects' car. As
far as I know, there were no explosives,'' Prechtel said.
   Prechtel declined to release the mens' names, but said one of
them had a British passport. Police found no documents on the other
man.
   Officials said the two men were arrested around midnight.
   Prechtel confirmed the radio report that the suspects were
caught near Waldfeucht near a British army base. Waldfeucht is 45
miles northwest of Cologne on the Dutch border.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and to unite it with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   Republican presidential nominee George
Bush said today that ``the waiting period for action on acid rain
is over'' and promised to support a program to reduce emissions by
the year 2,000.
   In turning his attention to environmental issues, the vice
president visited a park alongside Lake Erie near Detroit where he
said the specifics of his acid rain program could be worked out
later with Congress, ``but we must have a clear commitment to
emissions reductions, a clear time table.''
   Aides traveling with the vice president said his pledge was
designed to demonstrate that he would go beyond the steps taken
during the Reagan administration to clean up acid rain.
   The president has been criticized by environmentalists for
failing to do more to solve the problem during his two terms in
office. Earlier this month, however, Reagan gave the go-ahead for
continuing negotiations toward U.S. participation in an
international treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acid
rain.
   The administration had been divided on United Nations-sponsored
negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, toward a treaty that would
freeze emissions of nitrogen oxides until 1996.
   In a speech prepared for delivery, Bush said, ``I am an
environmentalist, always have been, from my earliest days as a
congressman ... and I always will be.''
   Aside from acid rain, he proposed several steps to clean up the
environment, including a global conference on the issue at the
White House at which all nations would be welcome.
   He also called for implementation of a protocol already
negotiated to limit emissions of nitrogen oxides. He said the
Superfund established to clean up toxic waste dumps has enough
money for the job and said the Environmental Protection Agency
should use its authority to enforce a program.
   ``Polluters should pay,'' the vice president said.
   Bush called for a ``zero tolerance'' policy for polluters
similar to the one used to combat drugs.
   On the acid rain issue, Bush said, ``the time for study alone
has passed. ... As president I will ask for a program to cut
millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 and
to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well.''
   ``I will work out the exact amount and the exact methodology
with the Congress,'' he said.
   Bush addressed the environment issue on a brief campaign trip to
Michigan regarded by strategists of both parties as a key
battleground for the fall campaign. The state has 20 electoral
votes.
   For the first time in several days Bush made no reference to his
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis in prepared remarks, but aides
said the vice president was considering a trip to Boston Harbor
later in the week to dramatize a pollution problem in the
Massachusetts governor's home state.
   Later in the week, Bush, who has proposed a ban on ocean
dumping, also will visit several beach sites in New Jersey and New
England.
   Bush aides said that the vice president would continue his
environmental pitch on a campaign swing to the West Coast that will
begin on Labor Day. The aides said this may follow a joint
appearance with running mate Sen. Dan Quayle at a park in Jersey
City, N.J., across from the Statue of Liberty, where Ronald Reagan
launched his campaign on Labor Day 1980.
   Bush on Tuesday wound up four days of attacks on Dukakis'
defense stands by telling an American Legion post at Fort Campbell,
Ky., he had ``deep, wide and worrisome'' differences with the
Democratic nominee on defense issues.
   ``If he doesn't want to modernize his snow blower, that's his
concern,'' Bush said, ``But if he doesn't modernize our weapons
systems, that puts the national security of the United States in
considerable risk.''
   The barbed reference to Dukakis' decades-old snow blower,
highlighted in a film at the Democratic National Convention,
brought cheers from Bush's audience of military veterans.
   Bush, a decorated World War II torpedo bomber pilot, described
himself as ``tested in combat'' in his talk in which he did not
mention Quayle, whose service in the Indiana National Guard during
the Vietnam war has become a heated campaign issue.
   However, at an earlier rally Tuesday at North Carolina Wesleyan
College in Rocky Mount, N.C., Bush voiced strong praise for Quayle.
   ``I'm proud of my running mate... It's nice to have a running
mate going in the same general direction as I am... We'll do just
fine,'' Bush told several thousand students.
   Meanwhile, Bush stood firmly behind his decision to agree to no
more than two presidential debates with Dukakis, suggesting any
more would bore U.S. viewers. The Democrats are asking for three
debates between Dukakis and Bush.
   Talks in Washington between Bush and Dukakis representatives
broke down on Tuesday after Bush Campaign Manager James A. Baker
III refused to budge from the two-debate format, with an additional
debate for vice presidential contenders. Talks were to resume on
Thursday.
   ``This is a firm position ... This is our only offer,'' said
Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller.

   The Boeing 727, involved in a Delta Airlines
crash Wednesday at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, was initially
designed for short to medium routes and was one of the most popular
commercial jetliners ever made.
   The three-engine plane with the distinctive T-tail, no longer
manufactured, made its first flight Feb. 9, 1963. It was designed
for a maximum passenger capacity of about 130, though later models
could carry 189 passengers.
   The plane has a range of more than 2,500 statute miles.
Production ended Aug. 14, 1984, with 1,831 delivered. It is flown
by more than 170 carriers.
   There are various models, all powered by Pratt & Whitney JT8D
turbofans.
   Models include:
   727-100, standard passenger seating 94. Length 133'2'', wingspan
108'. In service Feb. 1, 1964.
   727-100C, same size, convertible to all cargo. In service April
23, 1966.
   727-100QC, same thing, designed for quick conversions to
passenger or cargo.
   727-200, Length 153'2'', wingspan 108', 134 passengers. In
service Dec. 14, 1967.
   727-200 advanced version, same size, 145 passengers. In service
July 1972.
   727-200F, all freight version, same size, in service August 1983.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of townspeople, family members,
dignitaries and fellow aviators crowded into a small church today
to pay last respects to the three Italian pilots killed in the West
German air show disaster.
   Defense Minister Valerio Zanone and Senate President Giovanni
Spadolini headed the government delegation at the funeral service
for Lt. Col. Mario Naldini, 38; Lt. Col. Ivo Nutarelli, 41; and
Capt. Giorgio Alessio, 31.
   The three members of the Frecce Tricolori (Tri-Color Arrows)
acrobatic team were killed when their jets collided during an air
show Sunday at a U.S. military base in Ramstein, West Germany. One
of the planes hurtled into the crowd of spectators. At least 49
people were killed in the disaster.
   In addition to Air Force chief Gen. Franco Pisano and other
Italian military officials, members of precision flight teams from
France and Canada attended the service in the Ossario Temple church.
   The ceremony was led by a military chaplain, Archbishop Gaetano
Bonicelli, who read a message of blessing and condolence from Pope
John Paul II.
   In his homily, Bonicelli said the destiny of the three pilots
``invites us once again to grasp the meaning of the message of
Luke, accepting divine will, which we often can not comprehend, as
children often don't understand the will of their parents.''
   One pilot offered a prayer in which he urged Zanone to ``do all
you can so the Arrows remain. They are the most beautiful thing we
have.'' Zanone sobbed quietly.
   Some politicians in Italy have demanded the squadron be
disbanded, but Zanone and Pisano said earlier this week the team
would continue to fly.

   Hundreds of protesters demonstrated from
hilltops and in a flotilla of small boats today as two U.S.
warships capable of launching nuclear missiles arrived at the home
port of the U.S. 7th Fleet.
   The two ships are the first to be stationed in Japan with
launchers for Tomahawk missiles, which are made in both nuclear and
non-nuclear versions.
   ``Get out from Yokosuka!'' 100 people shouted in English at the
gates of the naval base as the Ticonderoga-class, guided missile
cruiser USS Bunker Hill and the destroyer USS Fife arrived in the
port, 30 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   A coast guard official said the warships arrived without
incident.
   Forty-two coast guard patrol boats escorted the ships into the
port to prevent the approach of 28 small boats carrying protesters
and banners reading ``No Tomahawks,'' the official said. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Japan forbids the production, possession, or introduction into
the country of nuclear weapons. Nearly 200,000 people died in the
Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the world's only
atomic attacks, during World War II.
   After the arrival of the ships, more protesters from civic and
peace groups, labor unions and the Japan Communist Party staged
separate rallies at a park overlooking the port, outside the naval
base and elsewhere. Police reported no arrests.
   Protesters said the biggest rally, sponsored by the communists,
drew an estimated 1,000 people.
   On Tuesday, Yokosuka's 48-member city assembly unanimously
passed a resolution calling on the government to cancel the arrival
of the U.S. warships. The mayor and governor lodged official
protests Monday with the Japanese government, saying it had not
done enough to ensure that the ships were not carrying nuclear
weapons.
   Local officials and civic groups have charged the ships may be
carrying nuclear-tipped Tomahawk missiles, in violation of Japan's
anti-nuclear policy.
   ``We hope our grassroot struggles will spread to a national
movement,'' said Yoshiko Saito, a leader of a citizens' group
staging a sit-in near the Yokosuka city hall.
   Both the 9,600-ton Bunker Hill and the 7,810-ton Fife are
capable of deploying Tomahawk missiles. Under a security agreement,
the United States has pledged to notify Japan if it plans to bring
nuclear arms into the country.
   However, critics charge the Japanese government uses the
agreement as a way of avoiding the question of whether U.S. ships
dock in the country with nuclear weapons aboard.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told reporters today that the
government would not ask the United States to confirm whether or
not the ships were carrying nuclear missiles, because ``we trust
each other in such matters,'' Kyodo News Service reported.
   The U.S. military, which has 50,000 personnel stationed in
Japan, maintains a policy of not publicly confirming or denying the
existence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships.

<HEAD>Sedition Charges Dropped Against Two Defendants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department today dropped sedition and
racketeering charges against two of seven avowed revolutionaries
accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the U.S. government.
   The charges against Thomas William Manning, 42, and Jaan Karl
Laaman, 38, were dismissed to expedite the trial being held in
Springfield, acting U.S. Attorney Richard G. Stearns said.
   The seven were charged with seditious conspiracy and
racketeering in connection with 10 bank robberies and several
bombings, including a 1976 blast that injured 22 people at Suffolk
County Courthouse in Boston.
   U.S. District Judge William G. Young in Springfield approved the
dismissal of charges.
   Manning and Laaman already have been sentenced to long prison
terms for related crimes.
   ``In light of the lengthy consecutive sentences now imposed on
both Manning and Laaman, it is not in the interests of justice to
prosecute either man further,'' Stearns said in a statement.
   Dropping the charges ``will, by effectively shortening the jury
selection process, allow the remaining defendants to proceed more
expeditiously to trial, without substantially compromising any
public interest,'' the statement said.
   Manning and Laaman were named in a 1986 indictment charging them
with violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
statute and federal seditious conspiracy laws.
   Laaman's 53-year federal sentence and additional 39- to 45-year
state sentence were upheld on appeal earlier this year. He was
convicted of six bombing charges and one charge of conspiracy. The
Massachusetts convictions involved the attempted murder of two
state troopers.
   Laaman will not be eligible for parole until Dec. 22, 2008.
   Manning also faces a 53-year sentence that has been upheld on
appeal. He was also sentenced to 25 years to life for the murder of
a New Jersey State Trooper.
   Laaman's attorney, Steven Schlang, said the defense team would
file motions asking that Laaman and Manning be allowed to stay at
the Hartford jail where the defendants are housed to help them in
the defense.

<HEAD>Chubb Agrees To Refunds, Payments; Won't Extend Deadline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Midwestern farmers who claim an
insurance company reneged on its summer drought insurance must meet
today's deadline if they want to apply for premium refunds, lawyers
said.
   Farmers can apply for the refunds or even double refunds without
forfeiting the right to sue the Chubb Group of insurers for
damages, according to an agreement filed Tuesday between lawyers
for farmers and Chubb.
   A federal court here is hearing a class-action suit on behalf of
farmers who bought drought insurance from the Federal Insurance
Company, a Chubb subsidiary.
   ``It is simply stating that the double-payment is not going to
prejudice anyone,'' said Stanley M. Chesley of Cincinnati, one of
four lawyers representing the farmers. He declined to comment
further.
   The insurance companies ``have agreed that farmers may accept
premium refunds and matching payments without jeopardizing any
claim for payments due under the policies,'' said Terry
Geibelstein, a Davenport, Iowa, lawyer who also represents the
farmers in the suit.
   But the statement, issued by Geibelstein, Chesley and lawyers
Robert A. Van of Davenport and Michael J. Freed of Chicago, noted
that Chubb refused to extend its Aug. 31 deadline for accepting
refunds and double-premium reimbursements to farmers who bought
drought insurance coverage that was subsequently denied. Farmers
must apply in letters postmarked no later than today to Chubb for
the refunds.
   Farmers in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan,
Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin say Chubb sold
them drought insurance but failed to pay their claims for damage
from this year's drought.
   Chubb announced in July that agents had oversold the insurance
and began to return premium checks. Chubb then issued some policies
and offered other farmers a double-premium bonus payment, but some
state insurance regulators have called the offer inadequate.

   Michael Dukakis' campaign manager said today the
Democrats would use the selection of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as the
Republican vice presidential nominee to question George Bush's
judgment and leadership in the upcoming fall campaign.
   ``Dan Quayle is going to emerge not only as an issue, but as a
liability on the Republican side because it goes to judgment and it
goes to leadership,'' top campaign aide Susan Estrich said at a
briefing on Dukakis campaign stragegy.
   ``We start this campaign on a solid footing in a close
competitive race,'' said Estrich.
   She said both the Dukakis campaign and the Democratic National
Committee were preparing separate advertising campaigns to air
Labor Day week.
   The party's advertising campaign will highlight the theme
``bringing prosperity home,'' while the initial campaign ads would
focus on Dukakis' record as governor of Massachusetts, portraying
him as a skilled administrator capable of implementing his goals of
an improved economy and better jobs.
   ``It's our sense right now that voters have only scant
information of what Dukakis has accomplished,'' she said.
   ``There is a lot of misinformation out there and we're going to
correct it,'' said Estrich, an indirect acknowledgment that
Republican nominee Bush has scored well in recent weeks with
attacks on Dukakis on such issues as his veto of legislation to
require the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in Massachusetts
schools.
   Estrich and Dukakis aide Jack Corrigon flatly denied they had
ever suggested to Jesse Jackson that he avoid campaigning in such
states as Michigan, Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas.
   A source close to Jackson said such a request was made and then
withdrawn when Jackson objected to the suggestion he ought to stay
out of states where he outpolled Dukakis in the Democratic
primaries. Jackson finished ahead of Dukakis in all of those states
except Texas.
   Jackson's role in the fall campaign has not yet been settled.
   Dukakis, who has been dividing his time between Statehouse
duties and campaigning as the Democratic presidential nominee, will
stay on the road five to six days a week after the holiday.
   Dukakis was traveling today to the West Coast, and after Labor
Day he will start a trip through the Midwest and East Coast that
will include a joint appearance with running mate Lloyd Bentsen at
a labor rally in Detroit.
   Bentsen, a Texan, will carry much of the burden of the attacks
on his Senate colleague from Indiana.
   Still unresolved, however, was what onetime presidential
contender Jackson would do, especially when and where Dukakis and
Jackson would make joint appearances.
   Jackson met in Washington on Thursday with Dukakis aides and
Democratic Party chairman Paul Kirk to discuss the campaign, but
very little was settled, according to one participant who asked not
to be identified.
   The source described Jackson as upset by a request, later
dropped, that he avoid appearances in several states, including
three that he carried in the Democratic primaries.
   Dayton Duncan, a Dukakis campaign spokesman, confirmed the
Jackson meeting took place but was unable to provide details.
   A Jackson supporter said the Dukakis aides had a list of states
_ Michigan, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia and Texas _ where they
did not want him to campaign. They said they were concerned that
his negative ratings were so high in those states that he might
hurt the ticket.
   Duncan said there was no such list.
   Jackson and his supporters said he beat Dukakis in the
Democratic primaries or primary-like caucuses in all of those
states but Texas. That dispute reportedly ended with the Dukakis
aides dropping their objections and Jackson saying he would
campaign in all but Texas.
   On Tuesday, officials of the Dukakis campaign met with their
counterparts in Bush's campaign to negotiate a debate schedule and
format.
   After a meeting with Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III
in Washington, Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas said the two
camps were far apart on arrangements for candidate debates.
   ``We want more debates, they want fewer,'' said Brountas. ``We
want to start them earlier, they want to start them later.
   ``We want to continue them up until the election takes place.
They would like to end them much earlier.''

<DATELINE>MOUNT DORA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early enthusiasm for the filming of a
horror movie in this town with a New England flavor has given way
to, well, expressions of horror.
   The film's ``purpose is to see how many people can be killed and
how gruesomely they can be killed, and I just don't think the city
wants to cooperate with any of that,'' said Mayor Jeff Book.
   Book called on City Council to declare a moratorium on
movie-making here because of plans for the filming by an
Italian-American company of ``Witch Story.''
   But the council rejected the mayor's request after dozens of
residents and business people supported the filmmakers at a special
meeting Tuesday night.
   ``The last thing this city council wants to do is try to
legislate morality,'' said Vice President Al Liveright of the Mount
Dora Chamber of Commerce.
   The mayor would like to see ground rules established for any
future movie projects in this central Florida town.
   In 1980, many downtown businesses were painted pink for the
movie ``Honky Tonk Freeway.''
   That was fun, many residents agreed, although the movie was a
box-office flop. So town officials were excited last week when
United Entertainment Corp. said it wanted to film a witch story
here because of Mount Dora's New England-style architecture and
ambiance.
   That enthusiasm lasted only until the mayor got a look at the
script.
   The low-budget ``splatter'' film is ``revolting and offensive,''
Book said.
   The script calls for a gang rape, a crushed skull, an exploding
child, a couple pureed in bed, a decapitation, a blood bath, an
exploding stomach and an exploding teen-ager, among other nasty
business.
   The witch would be dragged through city streets, repeatedly
raped and then burned at the stake.
   ``Some horror films, like some of Hitchcock's or `The Shining,'
are made with great style,'' said Book. ``But this is just garbage.
I don't think the city wants to be part of it.''
   Clara Pascal, a spokeswoman for the production company, said
company executives talked to Book about his concerns and would meet
with city officials. The film is in the planning stage, and no
production has begun.
   ``There are some things we might be able to do with the script.
We'd love to stay in Mount Dora,'' Ms. Pascal said. ``But it is a
horror movie.''
   Book said changing a few scenes would not help. ``If you deleted
all the offending scenes in this script, you'd have to start all
over with a new script,'' he said.
   ``We want to improve on `Honky Tonk Freeway,' not go down in
quality,'' the mayor added.

   Nearly 1,000 tanks, trucks, armored
personnel carriers and other military equipment rolled off a U.S.
Navy ship today for a key NATO exercise in southern West Germany.
   Two other ships earlier brought 2,000 pieces of equipment for
the Certain Challenge exercise on Sept. 12-23. About 125,000
personnel from the United States, Canada, Denmark, France, Britain
and West Germany will take part.
   U.S. Gen. John R. Galvin, the top commander of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization forces in Europe, inspected the equipment
aboard the USS Denebola when it docked today in Antwerp, 30 miles
north of Brussels.
   ``I'm quite satisfied with what I see,'' he told reporters after
a tour of the 946-foot long ship, which left Savannah, Ga., on Aug.
22.
   ``We do not have enough military force in Europe to be able to
truly defend Western Europe, and we are absolutely dependent on
fighting long enough over here with what we have in place in order
to wait for reinforcements to arrive,'' he said.
   ``This is what I'm going to need if, God forbid, we ever have a
war in Europe,'' he said. ``But the mere fact that we can do this
(provide equipment) ... is a very powerful deterrent that would
suppress any ideas of aggression.''

<TEXT>
   James D. Bowman, a senior editor in the World
Services division of The Associated Press and a former AP foreign
correspondent, died Tuesday night. He was 63.
   Bowman, whose AP career spanned 33 years, underwent abdominal
surgery in late July at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North
Tarrytown, New York, and had been in intensive care since then.
   He joined the AP in Dallas in 1955 as a newsman, transferred to
the Houston bureau in 1958 and to the World Desk in New York in
1960 as an editor of news transmitted to the AP's subscribers
outside the United States.
   Bowman, who was fluent in Spanish, was named chief of bureau in
Bogota, Colombia, in 1963, and reported from that country during a
period of civil unrest. He also covered news assignments elsewhere
in Latin America.
   Bowman returned to the World Desk in 1965, and in recent years
worked as North American editor, responsible for stories
transmitted overseas on U.S. and Canadian politics, economics and
social trends.
   Born Oct. 18, 1924, in Manor, Texas, Bowman earned a degree from
the University of Texas and served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps in
Europe during World War II.
   Before joining the AP, he was a communications supervisor at the
U.S. embassies in Moscow and Madrid. He left government service in
1953 to join the San Angelo, Texas, Standard-Times, joining the
news cooperative two years later.
   Bowman is survived by his wife, Ruthanne, a son, Bryan, and a
daughter, Sherry.

   Soldiers, meanwhile, went from house-to-house searching for
striking engineers who closed Burma's largest oil refinery, sources
said. The engineers and other workers have gone on strike to press
for democracy.
   Also today, 1,200 more prisoners were released from Insein Jail
in the capital and another prison in the central city of Mandalay,
the state-run Radio Rangoon said. Authorities have been freeing
prisoners after disturbances last week at these and seven other
jails.
   ``The government has permitted peaceful assembly and processions
under the constitution,'' the radio broadcast also said. ``In some
towns, People's Council (local government) offices and other
government buildings are illegally occupied by the people.''
   ``Illegal occupants must vacate the People's Council offices and
government buildings immediately or face the consequences,'' said
the statement signed by Maung Ko, secretary to the Council of
Ministers, or the Cabinet.
   The broadcast did not specify the possible consequences.
   Scarce gasoline supplies and a 5-day-old strike by railroad
workers continued to cripple the nation's transportation system,
contributing to food shortages, a Western diplomat said.
   The government has remained silent on the strikers' demands, and
spreading violence and disorder have given rise to rumors of an
impending military coup. Some observers say the Burma Socialist
Program Party is orchestrating the chaos in order to intervene and
re-establish itself.
   Authorities on Tuesday freed hundreds of inmates from Burmese
jails.
   Striking employees from more than 120 government departments and
state-owned corporations on Tuesday formed a committee to agitate
for an end to one-party rule. Their All Services General Strike
Committee was the fourth illegal association created in Burma in
three days.
   Students and dock workers also have formed unions and 21 elder
statesmen, some associated with the last elected government 26
years ago, created a Committee for Democracy.
   In addition, citizens have formed committees in an attempt to
govern many Burmese cities, which were left without authorities
when troops and officials loyal to the embattled government cleared
out.
   Burma's turmoil began after the July 23 resignation of ruler Ne
Win, who ended democracy with a 1962 military coup, established
one-party rule and outlawed all other parties, unions and
associations.
   Thousands of citizens staged protests against Ne Win's hard-line
successor, Sein Lwin, and at least 112 people were killed in
clashes with security forces.
   The violence continued until Sein Lwin resigned and was replaced
Aug. 19 by civilian lawyer Maung Maung. Since then, peaceful
rallies and widespread strikes demanding an end to one-party rule
have continued.
   The strikes have paralyzed most government services and
industries, including the country's only oil refineries _ in
Syriam, about 10 miles southeast of Rangoon, and in the central
city of Mann. Severe gasoline shortages has forced transportation
to a crawl.
   Workers at the Syriam refinery _ which had produced 26,000
barrels of oil per day _ staged an occupation strike after students
called for a nationwide general strike two weeks ago.
   The plant was shut down and military engineers tried in vain to
operate it. On Tuesday, authorities ordered soldiers to begin
house-to-house searches for civilian engineers from the refinery to
force them back to work, an engineer told The Associated Press
today. So far, the soldiers haven't found the striking employees,
said the engineer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said he
and his colleagues have gone into hiding and would strike until
authorities form an interim government to lead the country to
democracy.

<HEAD>Israeli Says Hussein Move on West Bank Temporary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Israeli official said today he does
not accept as permanent the decision of King Hussein of Jordan to
sever his government's ties with the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Abraham Tamir, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry,
told reporters that Hussein is well aware that it is impossible to
reach a ``final stage solution'' between Israel and the
Palestinians without Jordan.
   Hussein knows that ``some day he will be called back to
negotiate on the final status because without Jordan, you can't
solve the problem ... He knows it very well,'' Tamir said.
   A month ago, Hussein announced he was ``dismantling the legal
and administrative links'' between Jordan and the West Bank, a move
that was seen by some as a setback for hopes that a regional peace
settlement might be reached.
   Tamir suggested that it is unrealistic to assume that Jordan
could sever its historical ties to an area it once ruled, noting
that the Camp David agreement envisions a role for Jordan in the
final stages of negotiations.
   At the same time, there have been repeated hints over the past
month that Hussein's move may induce the Palestine Liberation
Organization to initiate a proposal for peace with Israel.
   Tamir, who is here for talks with U.S. officials, said there is
an urgent need to end the turmoil in the occupied territories and
move toward a settlement through negotiations.
   As a result of Palestinian unrest dating back eight months, a
``very dangerous'' situation has been created, he said, adding that
it would be unwise to allow the status quo to exist much longer.
   He rejected the view of those who say that Israel ``can wait and
wait and wait,'' expecting that the Arabs ``will crawl on their
knees and be ready to accept a peace on the basis of our
conditions.''
   To get a negotiating process started, Tamir said ``we have to
mobilize all forces'' starting with the United States and Egypt in
support an effort to reach an interim agreement with leaders of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   As long a serious peace talks are delayed, he said the uprising
in the territories will continue and that the situation could
deteriorate into another Arab-Israeli war.

throughout the nation.
   Aug. 30
   The Lewiston (Maine) Daily Sun on protecting national secrets:
   The idea of Americans passing along secrets to the enemy has
always been an abhorrent one, and news of another such situation in
West Germany makes one wonder about this nation's moral fiber.
   It also raises questions about the government's
counterintelligence capabilities. ...
   It's evident that too many people hold security clearances to
handle classified documents.
   And handing out clearances to so many young military people,
most not mature enough to handle the responsibility, is a
questionable practice. ...
   The government may have to consider draconian measures to stop
the flight of secrets to Warsaw Pact nations and elsewhere.
   More rigorous investigations and follow-ups as well as workplace
surveillance are not pleasant prospects but it may be coming to
that. In some instances, it's a matter of sloppy security practices.
   Whatever the case, the nation's critical defense secrets must be
protected better than they have been.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on the presidential campaign:
   George Bush says he yearns for a ``kinder, gentler nation.'' ...
   At the same time, the vice president and his friends have
expended excessive energy trying to brand Democratic presidential
contender Michael S. Dukakis as disloyal. ...
   Sadly, the vice president has squandered several opportunities
to say something meaningful by instead dwelling on the fact that as
governor of Massachusetts, Dukakis vetoed a bill that would have
imposed criminal fines on teachers who failed to lead their class
in the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Dukakis correctly nixed the bill because of state and U.S.
Supreme Court rulings that such laws are unconstitutional.
   Bush claims he would have signed it anyway. Does this mean he
has little respect for Supreme Court interpretations of the
Constitution or that he holds the Constitution in as little regard
as some other Reagan administration officials have?
   Why has Bush insisted on beating this non-issue into the ground?
He should be above such cheap shots.
   Bush and Dukakis can show real leadership and character by
rising from the mud and dwelling on the issues _ and by doing so
with specifics, not platitudes.

   The Herald, Everett, Wash., on Dan Quayle:
   Sen. (Dan) Quayle's decision to write press releases during the
Vietnam War is not, by itself, reason to question his suitability
for the vice presidency. But repeated instances of hypocrisy are
another matter altogether.
   It seems Quayle holds two standards, one for the nation, and
another for himself.
   The public Quayle champions the family and war games, and
opposes nuclear disarmament and negotiations with the Soviets, with
a passion no doubt genuine.
   But as Quayle's National Guard escapade reveals, there's another
private man behind the public mask who does not live out the values
he espouses.
   Despite his heavy-handed war philosophy, given the opportunity
to fight, he has dodged dangerous assignments. His rhetoric
honoring the family sings pure Republican.
   But the private man has felt no compunction against
propositioning a Playboy model, or even carousing in that set of
company.
   There, Quayle the private man has revealed himself to be an
opportunist, his personal politics and morality vulnerable to the
convenience of the moment. ...
   That he has tried to rationalize the way he exempts his own
behavior from the code he holds to the nation should disappoint the
public. That he feels free to condemn anyone who points to the
inconsistencies suggests he is too immature to face himself.

   The Daily Ardmoreite, Ardmore, Okla., on Pentagon contract
prices:
   Taxpayers are well aware of _ and understandably incensed by _
the more spectacular cases of Pentagon contract price-gouging.
   They should be equally upset by results of a four-year federal
audit that proves overcharging is common on defense contracts.
   The study of 95 contractors found that 365 of 774 pricing
actions, a hefty 47.2 percent, were overpriced by $788.9 million.
   A big chunk of that supposedly will be recovered with interest
from offending contractors.
   But how much more is being lost?

   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on an experimental drug for AIDS
patients:
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's flexible, new approach
to drug marketing brings hope to thousands of people afflicted with
AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses.
   After years of dogged resistance, the FDA has suddenly relaxed
its rigid rules and bowed to logical demands that an experimental
drug be made more widely available to sufferers of a severe form of
pneumonia that is the leading cause of death in AIDS patients.
   Under the new policy, the FDA has agreed to make the drug
trimetrexate freely available to physicians throughout the United
States, even though the drug has not passed all the tests normally
required for marketing approval.
   Naturally, the FDA should not relax its careful scrutiny of new
drugs in ordinary circumstances. To do so would place the public at
risk.
   But where there is a chance of saving lives in otherwise
hopeless situations, risks are justified.

   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on George Bush-Dan Quayle:
   The circus that the Dan Quayle campaign has become may be the
media's show, but it's not our fault.
   The people responsible include a Republican presidential
candidate who should know better, but nonetheless sprung a
virtually unknown and untested U.S. Senator on the public and can't
understand why we're interested in virtually every minute of the
curious past that led to his surprising elevation.
   Who is he and where did he come from?
   These are legitimate questions, and if the pursuit of them
reminds (George) Bush of a ``feeding frenzy'' among fish, it's a
possibility that should have occurred to an experienced politician
with five months to think about his running mate.

   The Post-Crescent, Appleton-Neenah-Menasha, Wis., on Oliver
North:
   There's something discomforting about an indicted felon stumping
for a political candidate for a $25,000 fee.
   It seems surreal to hear of 1,000 people, some in $500 front-row
seats, pay homage to a former Marine lieutenant colonel who fell
from grace as he spoke of patriotism and salvation coming only from
the Republican ranks. ...
   Last summer, Ollie North was the darling of the airwaves as he
survived four days of congressional grilling before a live,
television audience.
   His rhetoric and flag-waving clouded the charges and almost
turned the tables on his interrogators.
   But in the end he was indicted and now faces charges of
obstruction of justice, tax fraud and personal enrichment for his
role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   To raise money for his defense, he has taken to the road,
commanding large fees for a small dose of pseudo-patriotic talk.
   He's unrepentant for his role in the sordid sales of arms to
Iran and in illegally delivering those profits to the Contras. ...
   He may retain some popular appeal as an anti-communist zealot
but his days are over as a credible foot-soldier.

   New Jersey Herald, Newton, N.J., on John Zaccaro's jail
conditions:
   Few convicted cocaine dealers are lucky enough to face the kind
of music John Zaccaro Jr. is listening to these days after being
convicted on a felony drug charge.
   Punishment for the son of former Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro isn't a deservedly long sentence in a
tiny cell in a bleak jail.
   He is enjoying a four-month stay in a $1,500 (a month) luxury
apartment in Burlington, Vt., which comes with cable television and
maid service.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn, who prosecuted
Zaccaro, ... calls it a joke, as though Zaccaro were merely
grounded. We agree.
   Where prisons and jails are dangerously overcrowded, such
alternative criminal justice programs can have a place.
   But permitting a drug dealer such house arrest luxuries hardly
sends the right message about justice being blind, especially when
the pampered ``prisoner'' is the son of an influential politician.

   The Knoxville (Tenn.) News-Sentinel on profiting from the
drought:
   ``Hey, haven't you heard about the drought?'' That's a standard
reply these days to complaints about the high cost of putting food
on the table.
   Cost-of-living statistics for July showed that the overall
inflation rate for that month was 0.4 percent, but the jump in
supermarket prices was 1.4 percent.
   The price of bread made from wheat harvested before the drought
has gone up sharply. Cereals made from pre-drought grain have
climbed.
   What about beef? Prices were supposed to go down because cattle
raisers and many dairy farmers have been dumping animals on the
market to avoid having to feed them. But ... beef prices in stores
haven't dipped and some have gone up.
   Donald Ratajczak of the Georgia State University's economic
forecasting center says that ``perhaps half'' the increased prices
recorded on supermarket shelves can be traced to the drought.
   If he is right, the other half can be laid to efforts to cash in
on a drought psychology that has prepared consumers to expect
higher prices.
   Shoppers can pass up purchases of items they suspect have been
deliberately overpriced. Unsold foodstuffs piling up in stores
would send a message all along the food chain that consumers are
tired of taking it in the neck.

   Decatur (Ill.) Herald and Review on landfill regulations:
   There is certain to be plenty of opposition to proposed federal
Environmental Protection Agency rules for future landfill
operations.
   Requiring bottom liners, waterproof covers and detection and
monitoring systems to prevent ground water damage will be expensive.
   If anything, however, these rules do not go far enough.
   At this point in mankind's history, we are becoming painfully
aware of the damage civilization is doing to our planet and its
ecology. ...
   We need:
   _Mandatory recycling of all non-biodegradable materials. ...
   _Ending our dependence on plastics. ...
   _Confinement of hazardous liquids and other materials to special
sites. ...
   At stake is the kind of world our children and grandchildren
will inherit.
   Someday, adventurers in space may find or create new habitats
for human civilization and development. Until then, this is the
only planet we have. We must start taking better care of it.

   The Dallas Morning News on spying:
   Once again, Americans are reminded that spies are real
creatures, not just the figments of fiction writers' imaginations.
...
   The United States' latest alleged traitor is ... former Army
Sgt. 1st Class Clyde Lee Conrad. ...
   He is accused of selling the location of NATO missiles, the
route of a super-secret pipeline and plans for blunting a Warsaw
Pact thrust into central Germany.
   The Conrad flap should first remind every American that, the
smiling face of glasnost notwithstanding, there are enemies in the
world who are prepared to do us and our allies harm. ...
   The death penalty is not used in Germany, where Conrad is being
charged, so if found guilty, he will not have to forfeit his life
for jeopardizing the life and safety of millions. That's
regrettable.
   The Conrad case is a reminder that the death penalty should be
applicable in peacetime as well as during a declared war.
   The world is a precarious place even during peacetime; having
tactical and strategic information sold to potential enemies makes
peacetime all the more fragile.

order to fire was justified.
   The report makes much of the stressful environment. The

   Los Angeles Daily News on inflation:
   The cloud of inflation is growing over the Reagan
administration's remarkable record of 70 straight months of
economic growth.
   Rising prices have not reached economy-busting proportions yet,
but the 5.1 percent inflation rate reported last week has the
potential to get much worse. ...
   The explanation most often heard for inflation is that the
economy is growing too fast.
   Technically, that's true, a robust economy fueled by rampant
consumer spending but an inadequate supply of goods and services,
always forces prices up. ...
   Those who favor real victory over the inflationary monster
should look at low productivity, not consumers, as the culprit.
   Raise productivity and you give the economy the ability to meet
the consumers' rising demand.
   To do this, American productivity has to grow at a far greater
rate than it has in recent years.
   But the best ways for a government to promote higher
productivity _ lowering business taxes to permit companies to keep
more of their profits and invest in new equipment _ are not
necessarily the most politically popular. ...
   Whoever will lead the nation from January 1989 on will have to
show the moxie to battle inflation and the intellectual ability to
understand its relation to productivity.

   Under normal circumstances that policy makes good sense. But

policy comes up as dry as Montana.

that. The fact that they didn't is a matter of grave concern. ...

<TEXT>
   An IRA bomb exploded today in
an apartment in a Roman Catholic section of Londonderry, killing a
man and a woman who accidentally triggered the blast by climbing
through a window, police said.
   The Irish Republican Army apologized for the killings and said
the bomb was intended for British soldiers known to be checking
houses in the area.
   Also today, the IRA said three of its members killed by British
soldiers on Tuesday were ``on active service,'' the IRA's term for
a guerrilla mission.
   In West Germany, officials said they caught two men believed to
be IRA guerrillas as they tried to cross the border from the
Netherlands with weapons. The pair was apprehended around midnight
near a British air base.
   Police said another man was injured when the bomb demolished the
apartment in Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second-biggest city.
   A police spokesman, Sgt. Winston Winters, said the victims were
innocent neighbors who were worried that a young man living in the
apartment had not been seen for several days.
   Winters said the man who climbed inside accidentally triggered
the bomb, demolishing the apartment in the mainly Roman Catholic
Creggan area. He said police were investigating reports that the
IRA had kidnapped two occupants of the home several days ago and
held them at gunpoint while planting the bomb.
   The IRA's Londonderry unit circulated an apology to local news
media saying the bomb was intended for an army search squad.
   ``Although the operation was carefully planned, it went
tragically wrong. At no stage, unfortunately, was it anticipated
that a member of the public would enter the flat (apartment)
through a front window and open a booby-trapped door.''
   Northern Ireland police and the British army released few
details of Tuesday's ambush and killing of the three IRA guerrillas
on a country road at Drumnakilly in County Tyrone.
   The spot was only eight miles from Ballygawley, where an IRA
bomb blew up a military bus Aug. 20, killing eight soldiers and
injuring 27.
   British media reports said commandos of the British Army's elite
Special Air Services regiment ambushed and killed the three men as
they prepared to attack a soldier of the locally recruited Ulster
Defense Regiment. The police and army refused to comment on the
reports.
   Sinn Fein, legal political wing of the outlawed IRA, said
Tuesday the slain men were IRA members. It identified them as Brian
Mullen and brothers Gerard and Martin Harte.
   Today, it released a statement from the IRA's Mid-Ulster
battalion saying the men were killed while ``on active service.''
   The killings were seen as the start of a tougher British policy
to combat increased IRA attacks.
   So far this year, the IRA has killed 27 members of the British
security forces in gun and bomb attacks in Northern Ireland,
mainland Britain and continental Europe in its fight to end British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   With Tuesday's deaths, the IRA has lost 11 members so far this
year.
   British news reports said Mullen was one of eight men questioned
by police after the Aug. 20 bus bombing.
   The government's Northern Ireland Office refused to say if the
shootings were a result of new security measures in the British
province.
   Security forces have denied accusations they operate a so-called
shoot-to-kill policy, in which suspects are gunned down without
being given a chance to surrender. On March 6, British commandos
killed three unarmed IRA guerrillas on a bombing mission in
Gibraltar.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
the predominantly Protestant province and to unite it with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<HEAD>Ex-Aide Said Nixon Wanted On-Off Button For White House Taping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the infamous White House taping system
was being planned, President Nixon suggested that he have a button
to turn it on and off manually, but was dissuaded by an aide who
says he thought the president was too clumsy.
   Therefore, a voice-activated system was installed and Nixon
quickly lost awareness that his every conversation was being
recorded, says former White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman in
an article for the National Archives publication ``Prologue.''
   The tapes led to Nixon's resignation in August 1974 when they
provided damning evidence that he had consented to the White House
cover-up of the Watergate break-in.
   Haldeman said Nixon had resisted the idea of taping
conversations but reluctantly agreed it was the best way to get an
accurate record of meetings.
   ``He suggested we might install the same kind of switch- or
button-operated machine that (Lyndon) Johnson had used.'' Haldeman
wrote. ``That would allow him to turn the system on or off as he
thought best.''
   The former aide continued:
   ``I responded, `Mr. President, you'll never remember to turn it
on except when you don't want it, and when you do want it you're
always going to be shouting _ afterwards, when it's too late _ that
no one turned it on.'
   ``I added, silently, in my own thoughts, that this president was
far too inept with machinery ever to make a success of a switch
system.''
   The taping system that finally was installed was activated by
the Secret Service's locator system which keeps track of the
president's whereabouts.
   Eventually, five microphones were put in the president's desk,
two were in wall lamps at each side of the fireplace on the
opposite side of the Oval Office, and there were others in the
Cabinet Room, Nixon's office in the Old Executive Office Building
and at Camp David, Md., the presidential retreat.
   ``The historiography of the Nixon administration will eventually
be much the richer as a result of Richard Nixon's decision to
tape-record his meetings and telephone conversations,'' Haldeman
writes. ``Nixon was not thinking of historians when he made this
decision, but they will be the ultimate beneficiaries.''
   Haldeman's account is much softer in tone and less critical of
Nixon than when he described the same events in a 1978 book, ``The
Ends of Power,'' which he said ``was unfortunately sensational in
many instances where I would have preferred it to be more reasoned
and thorough.''
   In the book, Haldeman said Nixon had ``fudged'' the tape story
in various ways, ``climaxing with the assertion on television in
1977 that he had ordered me to destroy all of the tapes.'' There is
no reference to that in the Prologue article.
   Haldeman says he is amazed how quickly he forgot about the
system once it was in place.
   ``For a short time, I worried that it might not be working, and
I dispatched someone to test the machinery,'' he writes. ``But the
worry quickly passed, as did any awareness at all that Nixon's
conversations _ my conversations, often _ were being taped. I think
Nixon lost his awareness of the system even more quickly than I
did.''
   Nixon himself has written that ``initially I was conscious of
the taping, but before long I accepted it as part of the
surroundings.''
   Nixon fired Haldeman in April 1973 at the height of the cover-up
of the June 1972 break-in, when burglars placed bugs in telephones
and searched files in Democratic Party headquarters in the

<HEAD>GAO Raps Education Dept. For Student Loan Errors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Education Department may be paying banks
and other lenders millions of dollars each year in excess subsidies
on student loans, the General Accounting Office said Wednesday.
   The congressional watchdog agency said the department performs
an inadequate job of checking the accuracy of the bills that
lenders submit for their government-subsidized interest payments.
   GAO auditors who reviewed 2,038 loan accounts at 16 major
lenders found 18 percent were in error or lacked adequate
documentation to support the amount billed.
   ``The cause of these errors varied, but generally resulted from
lenders' miscalculating loan principal balances and interest
subsidy due, and continuing to bill the department after borrowers
began repaying,'' the report said.
   Based on the errors found in the loan accounts it reviewed from
a three-month period in 1985, the GAO estimated that the government
overpaid the 16 lenders at least $1.8 million for that quarter,
when they received a total of $69.4 million in interest subsidies.
   The GAO said three lenders had voluntarily repaid the government
$345,071 in interest subsidy overbillings from that quarter and
other recent billing periods.
   The department paid lenders $2.4 billion in interest subsidies
on $39 billion of outstanding guaranteed student loans in 1986. An
estimated 14,000 lenders _ banks, savings and loan associations,
life insurance companies and credit unions _ make the loans.
   The government guarantees repayment of the loans and pays all
the interest until six months after the student leaves college.
   ``The Department of Education's inadequate oversight could be
costing the federal government millions of dollars each year in
interest subsidy overpayments to lenders in the guaranteed student
loan program,'' the GAO said.
   The GAO recommended that Congress amend the Higher Education Act
to allow the education secretary to charge lenders interest on
overpayments and require lenders to have independent auditors
verify their loan accounts and interest billings.
   The Education Department said it agreed generally with the
report and already was taking steps to improve its ability to
detect interest billing errors.
   ``We believe the department currently has the authority to
assess interest on overpayments,'' the department said, adding that
it does not oppose amending the law to spell out that authority.

   The Delta Airlines jetliner sounded
normal as it took off, then seemed to drag its tail and plunged to
the ground in a ball of fire and ``a cloud of smoke about three
stories tall,'' witnesses said.
   The Boeing 727, Flight 1141, crashed today on takeoff from
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport with 104 people aboard.
   ``I was coming over the bridge on I-30 in Arlington, and I saw a
big ball of fire going into the air,'' Greg Isaacs of Dallas told
KRLD radio. ``I started driving over there and it looked like it
was over near DFW, and I thought, `No way could it be an airplane
accident...'
   ``It was an unbelievably big explosion. I could not believe it.
I absolutely could not believe it was that big an explosion.''
   David Hooker, 28, of Celina, was waiting at a gas station at the
south end of the airport when the plane crashed.
   ``I heard the normal noise of an airplane taking off. I turned
to watch and just barely saw the nose clear a building over
there,'' he said pointing to a low warehouse-type building about a
half-mile away. ``Then there was a cloud of smoke about three
stories high and an explosion.''
   Clive Lane saw the plane from his window before it crashed.
   `` I noticed the tail was sort of hanging down, like, you know,
it shouldn't have been,'' Lane said. ``And then I saw red sparks
starting at the back of the tail, and I thought that's not its
light, that's a fire. Then I watched it put its tail into the
ground and exploded in a huge ball of fire.''
   Chip Miller arrived at the scene minutes after the crash.
   ``There were probably three different colors of smoke coming out
of the fuselage,'' Miller told Cable News Network. ``The entire
half of the plane from the wings back were on fire and charred.
Part of the fuselage was cracked above the wing.
   ``There wasn't as much fire as there was three types of smoke
but the whole area around the plane was on fire.''
   Passengers on the plane ``had no idea what happened,'' said
Jerry Weeks. ``The plane had slid sideways about the last 100 yards
on the ground,'' Weeks said. ``It wasn't a violent crash. It wasn't
cartwheeling or anything like that.''

   Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou underwent
tests Wednesday to determine if he needs surgery for his heart
condition, an embassy official said.
   Doctors at St. Thomas' Hospital will decide Thursday or Friday
if Papandreou, 69, will need an operation for a narrowing of his
aorta, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Papandreou flew to London on Aug. 25 from Greece but the tests
were postponed because of a holiday weekend, he said.
   He said Papandreou's son, Nicholas, and his daughter, Sophia,
and her husband had flown from Greece to visit him.

   A man was arrested for allegedly biting
off part of another man's nose during a fight, authorities said.
   Brenton Cram, 24, of Statesville was arrested Tuesday as he
walked along Interstate 77 and was charged with the felony maiming
of Chris Hedrick.
   Cram, released on $5,500 secured bond, faces up to 10 years in
prison if convicted.
   Hedrick, 21, was in good condition Tuesday at Iredell Memorial
Hospital.
   Cram's estranged wife, Alisa Wise Cram, and authorities searched
with flashlights for more than an hour in heavy rain but could not
find the missing third of Hedrick's nose.
   Authorities said Alisa Cram is Hedrick's girlfriend.
   The two men and Mrs. Cram met on the highway Monday night,
officials said.
   ``Hedrick thought that Cram was going to beat the girl so he
tried to pull Cram off her,'' sheriff's Detective Judy Herman said.
``Then they began to fight. And that's when he bit him.''
   Cram told sheriff's deputies he was acting in self-defense.

   An oil painting featuring Walt Disney
characters Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge has been sold for $75,000,
it was announced Wednesday.
   Real estate developer Robert E. Hall of Harrisburg, Pa., bought
the painting by former Disney artist Carl Barks from Another
Rainbow, a Disney licensee.
   The painting, featuring Scrooge, Donald and siblings Huey, Dewey
and Louie, is named ``Makings of a Fish Story'' and was painted
earlier this year.
   Barks, who lives in Oregon, wrote and drew more than 500 Duck
family comic book stories from the 1940s to the mid-1960s. His most
famous original creation was the wealthy old miser, Scrooge.
   Another Rainbow publisher Bruce Hamilton said at least eight of
Barks' oil paintings have sold for more than $70,000.
   Hall said he sold stock to raise cash for the painting because
``I think it's a better investment for me at this time. Besides,
it's a lot more fun.''

<NOTE>EDs: TOP 16 grafs new to UPDATE with Bush comments on the

   George Bush promised today to solve the acid rain problem by
reducing emissions by the year 2,000 and declared ``I am an
environmentalist, always have been.'' Aides to Democrat Michael
Dukakis said they would use Bush's selection of Dan Quayle as his
running mate to question the Republican nominee's judgment.
   Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich said the Democratic
National Committee and the campaign were preparing separate
advertising campaigns to kick off the fall campaign after Labor
Day. Among the campaign's targets for the fall: the choice of the
Indiana senator for the GOP ticket.
   ``Dan Quayle is going to emerge not only as an issue, but as a
liability on the Republican side because it goes to judgment and it
goes to leadership,'' Estrich said at a briefing on Dukakis
campaign strategy.
   The Democratic nominee raised questions about Bush's leadership
ability on Tuesday in resurrecting the Iran-Contra scandal, asking,
``How can you possibly sit there and do nothing while we traded
arms to a terrorist nation?''
   Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas said today that Bush has
yet to explain his role in the arms-for-hostages deal, which
creates a ``very serious issue of George Bush's judgment.'' His
comments came on ``CBS This Morning.''
   Dukakis was to continue his attack on Bush's role in the scandal
at an afternoon news conference with Maine Sen. George Mitchell,
who served on the congressional panel investigating the affair and
co-authored a newly published book on Iran-Contra.
   The vice president, who turned his attention to the environment
during a brief campaign stop alongside Lake Erie near Detroit,
proposed several clean-up measures as well as a global conference
on the issue.
   ``The time for study alone has passed. ... As president I will
ask for a program to cut millions of tons of sulfur dioxide
emissions by the year 2,000 and to significantly reduce nitrogen
oxide emissions as well,'' he said.
   Aides traveling with the vice president described his pledge as
a step beyond Reagan administration policy. Environmentalists have
criticized the president for dragging his feet on acid rain and
other issues during his tenure.
   Bush proclaimed, ``I am an environmentalist, always have been,
from my earliest days as a congressman ... and I always will be.''
   The vice president, for the first time in several days, made no
reference to his Democratic rival, but aides said he was
considering a trip to Boston Harbor in the Massachusetts governor's
home state to dramatize the pollution problem.
   Quayle, meanwhile, traveled to Louisiana with his wife, Marilyn,
as part of a five-state southern swing.
   The Dukakis campaign today tried to dispel reports of lingering
tension between the Dukakis camp and Jesse Jackson over how the
former candidate would campaign for the Democratic ticket.
   Estrich and Dukakis aide Jack Corrigan denied they had ever
suggested to Jackson that he avoid campaigning in such states as
Michigan, Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas.
   Sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said Tuesday
that Jackson resisted attempts to limit the states in which he
campaigns, but it was still unresolved where and when Dukakis and
Jackson would appear together.
   On Tuesday, Bush ridiculed Dukakis' snowblower _ the prized
emblem of the Democratic presidential nominee's
budget-consciousness _ during one of several appearances in which
he continued to criticize Dukakis as weak on defense.
   ``If he doesn't want to modernize his snowblower, that's his
concern,'' Bush said at Fort Campbell, Ky., referring to the
25-year-old snowblower that figured prominently in a film about
Dukakis at the Democratic National Convention. ``But if he doesn't
modernize our weapons systems, that puts the national security of
the United States in considerable risk.''
   Dukakis, resurrecting the Iran-Contra arms and money scandal as
a campaign issue, said Bush was head of an anti-terrorism task
force that had issued a report denouncing any concessions to
terrorist nations.
   ``The president and the vice president and a number of other
people, over the opposition of the secretary of state and the
secretary of defense, by the way, proceeded to do precisely what
that commission said you should never do,'' Dukakis said at a news
conference during a tour of Western Massachusetts.
   ``Making tough decisions is a test of leadership,'' Dukakis
said. ``George Bush endorsed the decision to sell arms to Iran and
in doing so he failed that test.''
   Dukakis was spending most of today at the Massachusetts
Statehouse before flying to California for three days of
campaigning in Western states. His running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas, was taking the day off hunting in Wyoming.
   On Tuesday, officials of the Dukakis campaign met with their
counterparts in Bush's campaign to begin negotiations on a debate
schedule and format.
   Both sides reported being far apart. The Republicans say they
want two presidential debates and one confrontation between vice
presidential contenders, but nothing before Sept. 22. The Democrats
want a more extensive schedule.

   Anti-government protesters clashed with
police after the military junta nominated President Augusto
Pinochet to rule until 1997. Two people were killed during the
demonstrations and more than 800 arrested.
   At least 21 people were injured in the clashes.
   Pinochet, 72, promised a move toward democracy after being named
Tuesday as the only candidate in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum.
The right-wing general has run Chile since taking power in a bloody
1973 coup. Pinochet called on his followers ``to fight to achieve
victory'' in the presidential plebiscite.
   Thousands in the capital banged empty pots and pans in protest
and demonstrators erected barricades with burning tires and blocked
traffic at many intersections Tuesday night in Santiago, a city of
4.5 million residents.
   Hospital officials said Erickson Palma, 15, was killed by
unidentified gunmen who fired from a speeding car as he banged a
pot from the window of his home in southwestern Santiago.
   Officials at the hospital where Palma was taken said the
teen-ager was shot twice in the chest. The spokespeople said three
other demonstrators were shot and wounded in similar circumstances
and one of them, also a boy, died.
   Police Capt. Alejandro Sierra said 19 other people were injured
and 846 were arrested in Santiago. Four public buses were set afire
and destroyed by demonstrators, and one of the bus drivers was
seriously burned, he said.
   Similar protests occurred Tuesday night in many other cities.
Police did not report on casualties or arrests in those cities.
   But this morning, a duty officer at the Santiago police
headquarters said without elaborating, ``It's totally calm now.''
   The protests began as Pinochet and the other military commanders
met to choose the nominee, and became more violent through the
night.
   Power outages occurred in several suburbs of Santiago and the
northern coastal city of La Serena. The cause of the blackouts was
not known, but the power transmission towers are a favorite target
of leftist guerrillas.
   Pinochet heralded his nomination as ``a decisive moment in the
institutional process'' started by his 15-year-old government. The
opposition denounced it as the continuation of ``an aging
dictatorship.''
   ``If I govern, you govern,'' Pinochet told thousands of
supporters from a balcony of the government palace. He called on
them ``to fight to achieve victory'' in the upcoming ballot.
   Pinochet led the September 1973 coup that ousted the elected
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende, who died in the
palace takeover. Pinochet has been president of the military
government since.
   If the majority of the 7.2 million registered voters cast
``yes'' ballots for Pinochet, he will start a new term March 11 to
last until 1997. If he is rejected, an open election will take
place within a year, with Pinochet remaining in power until then.
   ``The operetta is over. Gen. Pinochet has imposed his will and
is preparing to continue to oppress his people until the end of the
century,'' said Ricardo Lagos, a socialist and co-leader of a
16-party opposition coalition.
   ``Chileans must decide between an aging dictatorship and renewed
democracy,'' Lagos said.
   The centrist Christian Democratic party said in a written
statement, ``The nomination of Gen. Pinochet, with his own vote, is
the best denial of the supposed democratic intentions of the
regime.''
   The nomination was made by Pinochet himself, along with Navy
commander Adm. Jose Toribio Merino; Air Force chief Gen. Fernando
Matthei and National Police director Gen. Rodolfo Stange.
   In his acceptance speech, Pinochet said his government is
forging a new society in Chile with a new type of democracy,
protected against ``totalitarianism.''
   ``The full democracy that approaches constitutes a new challenge
for everyone,'' he said. ``It also will demand of us all
overcoming, adapting and rectifying to create a new style of
political coexistence.''

<HEAD>Public Schools to Offer Religion or Mandatory Study Hour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public school children who don't want to take daily
religion class will have to replace that hour with ``equivalent
alternative material,'' the Council of State has ruled.
   Tuesday's ruling by the supreme administrative court that
advises the government on prospective legislation reversed a 1987
decision by the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio in which
students were given three choices: an hour of religion, an hour of
an alternative study or the option not to attend either.
   Just what subjects might be offered for the ``equivalent
alternative'' hour and who would be responsible for teaching them
is still undecided. The ruling was criticized for not first
legislating national guidelines for the alternative hour. Each
school can decide the content of the alternative study.
   Religious instruction in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic
country was made optional in a 1984 revision of the Concordat, or
Italian-Vatican treaty, but there has been no standard formula for
how such classes should be scheduled or what to do with students
not taking it.
   The issue developed into a church-state struggle last year. The
Vatican pushed for a mandatory alternative class, saying students
would be discouraged from attending religious classes if allowed to
leave school. ``Lay'' political forces objected, saying it would
compromise the optional future of religious instruction.
   In 1987 more than 90 percent of public school students
reportedly had signed up for Catholic teaching.

<TEXT>
   New York's top court today refused to hear
an appeal seeking to remove from the ballot U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi,
who resigned earlier this month after being convicted on corruption
charges.
   The refusal by the New York Court of Appeals to hear the appeal
of lower court rulings means that Biaggi's name likely will be on
the Sept. 15 Democratic primary ballot even though he has said he's
not a candidate.
   The only way Biaggi, D-N.Y., can now get off the ballot is by
death, being nominated for a state judgeship or moving out of the
state.
   Because of Biaggi's popularity, Bronx Democratic leaders believe
there's a strong possibility he could win the primary election. In
the heavily Democratic district, a Democratic primary victory
virtually guarantees a general election victory.

<HEAD>Burma Latest Example of `People Power' Against Authoritarians in
Asia</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is happening again in Asia: masses of people
mounting a sustained campaign of demonstration and protest against
an authoritarian government.
   For several weeks it has been Burma. A year ago it was South
Korea. In February 1986, ``people power'' in the Philippines ended
the 20-year presidency of Ferdinand E. Marcos and drove him into
exile.
   Popular protest developed differently in each case, under
markedly different circumstances, but brought changes that were
breathtaking for all three nations.
   There were signs that crowds of demonstrators in both South
Korea and Burma drew inspiration from the Philippine example.
   Some South Korean protesters cited the Philippines as a model of
an Asian nation throwing off oppressive rule without upsetting the
entire basis of society or destroying the economy.
   Foreign tourists emerging from Burma told reporters that many
Burmese, repressed for 26 years, found parallels with the
Philippines.
   The United States, which had close ties with the former regimes
in the Philippines and South Korea, says it welcomes more
representative government in Asia.
   After Burmese authorities lifted martial law last Wednesday and
said they would consider holding free elections, State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said: ``Certainly we welcome this
movement toward democracy.''
   Gaston J. Sigur, an assistant secretary of state, told a Senate
committee in May: ``Politically, progress toward increasingly
representative government continues apace in the Republic of Korea
and the Philippines. In short, events in the region have been going
our way.''
   Nonetheless, anti-American demonstrations have occurred as those
who demonstrated against their governments turned to protests of
U.S. military forces stationed in the two countries and American
support for the former leaders.
   American officials say Washington will face more difficult
relations with countries whose governments become more democratic.
   Burma followed an isolationist course under the ``Burmese way to
socialism'' of Ne Win, who seized power in a coup in 1962. He
resigned late in July and students led protests for democracy,
economic reform and release of prisoners.
   Ne Win's successor, Sein Lwin, jailed dissidents and soldiers
shot to kill in an unsuccessful attempt to stop demonstrations by
hundreds of thousands of people. Buddhist monks joined students in
reading pro-democracy proclamations.
   Sein Lwin resigned after 17 days, to be replaced by civilian
attorney Maung Maung, and the turmoil continues.
   Gregory Clark, professor of Japanese studies at Sophia
University in Tokyo and a widely published commentator on Asian
politics, said it was ``encouraging and remarkable that such latent
people power existed'' in Burma.
   ``We had thought they were a demoralized and docile population,
unhappy about governmental inefficiency but tolerating it,'' he
said. ``It turned out they had as much guts and bravery as the
people in the Philippines.''
   The Burmese did not have leaders to provide a focus as, for
instance, the Filipinos had in Corazon Aquino. She is the widow of
Benigno Aquino, who was assassinated when he returned home to
oppose Marcos, and became president when Marcos fled.
   Another difference was that a military revolt against Marcos
coincided with the popular uprising, while the Burmese military was
used against protesters.
   In South Korea, street battles last summer between huge crowds
and riot police led to major concessions toward democracy from the
military-backed government but did not overthrow it.
   Chun Doo-hwan, the outgoing president, accepted opposition
demands that included direct presidential elections, greater
freedom of speech and release of many political prisoners.
   Whether the revolt in Burma will bring greater democracy is not
yet clear, but Asians have shown that great potentional power lies
in coordinated mass effort in a region of 3 billion people.
   Asia's most noted proponent of mass action was Mohandas K.
Gandhi. He led vast throngs in demonstrations against British
colonial rule in India, which became independent in 1947.

   This year's Miss America Pageant
officially started when a small plane carrying the first contestant
touched down early Wednesday.
   While five somewhat sleepy hostesses waited outside the terminal
at the Atlantic City Airport, Miss New York Mia Seminoff stepped
off the plane at 7:30 a.m. and smiled for photographers.
   The finals of the 67-year-old pageant are not until Sept. 10,
but the 51 contestants _ one from each of the states plus the
District of Columbia _ are all expected to arrive by the end of the
day Thursday.
   The contestants are arriving earlier than usual this year to
rehearse a more elaborate production number, said pageant director
Leonard Horn.
   Miss Seminoff, 23, said she brought a few of her collection of
stuffed pigs as lucky charms. She also brought about 20 pieces of
luggage.
   ``Last week I reported that I'd only have eight,'' she said with
a grin.
   A senior in fine arts at the Juilliard school in New York City,
Miss Seminoff said she will perform a classical ballet routine in
the talent competition.
   Preliminary competitions start Sept. 7. The televised finale
begins Sept. 10, and is televised on NBC.
   Miss Seminoff said she is not new to Atlantic City. ``I've been
here before just watching in the audience,'' she said. ``It's
wonderful to finally get here and be on the stage as a contestant.''

   Seven stowaways from the Dominican
Republic were in custody Wednesday and authorities searched for an
eighth who jumped into the water at the Port Newark-Elizabeth
marine complex.
   Port Authority police began searching around 9 a.m. after
getting a report that up to 12 stowaways were in the area, said
spokesman Bill Cahill.
   When authorities arrived, six men were taken into custody and
two jumped into the water. One was rescued but the other, described
only as wearing a blue shirt, was not immediately found, said Coast
Guard Petty Officer David Santos.
   Santos said it was believed that four other stowaways fled.
   They had hidden in containers aboard the ship Discovery, which
arrived early Wednesday from the Dominican Republic, said a
spokeswoman for Sea-Land, the shipping company.
   ``The company is working with immigration, local police and Port
Authority officials to determine if there are any additional
stowaways and to coordinate their safe and expeditious return to
the Dominican Republic,'' said the spokeswoman.

   A jury today impeached Florala Mayor H.T.
Mathis on charges of neglect of duty and incompetence, removing him
from an office he used to publicize ``voodoo'' antics and to pardon
scores of drunken drivers.
   The 85-year-old mayor ran out of the Covington County courtroom
after the circuit court jury announced its verdict. His attorney,
James Prestwood, said he would seek a new trial for the mayor, who
testified that he pardoned dozens of convicted offenders because
he's ``soft hearted.''
   After one hour of deliberation this morning, the jury ruled that
Mathis should be removed from office because he's incompetent and
neglected his duty. The verdict means he was immediately ousted,
Circuit Judge William Baldwin said.
   Prosecution witnesses have depicted Mathis as a man who
undermined the law by abusing his pardon power during the last four
years. He is accused of pardoning more than 100 traffic offenders,
including 27 drunken drivers.
   But Mathis, taking the stand Tuesday to defend his performance
in office, said people came to him with sad stories and he was just
trying to help them.
   ``I'm just a little soft hearted,'' the former tire store owner
testified.
   The mayor of Florala, a town of about 5,000 on the Florida
border 20 miles south of Andalusia, drew national attention with
his July proclamation of ``National Voodoo Week'' and his earlier
purported attempt to scare the police chief by sprinkling so-called
``voodoo powder'' around City Hall, council chambers and down
corridors to the jail.
   However, Mathis testified that he did not believe in voodoo and
the yellow powder he spread at City Hall was sulfur powder not
meant to harm anyone physically. After the media reported the
incident, the mayor said he decided to capitalize on publicity.
   ``I don't even know what voodoo means,'' he testified. ``I made
a mistake in the way I did it.''
   Before taking the stand Tuesday, he told reporters: ``Satan is
trying to destroy Florala's government. I love Florala.''
   Prestwood said during closing arguments on the second day of the
trial that it would be cruel to impeach Mathis, whose term ends
Oct. 3. ``They've done everything in the book to make H.T. Mathis
look bad.''
   Mathis was depicted by prosecution witnesses as a man who
undermined the law by abusing his power to pardon drunken drivers.
   ``I have more power than Ronald Reagan,'' Mathis was quoted as
saying by City Clerk Betty Hooten.
   In the state's closing arguments, Assistant Attorney General Don
Valeska said no one in Florala expected Mathis ``would go power
crazy.''
   ``For him to have one more hour in office flies in the face of
our system of government,'' Valeska said.
   Later, state Attorney General Don Siegelman described the
situation in Florala as ``the most abusive case I've ever heard of
in the United States.''

   A floating crane lifted a crumpled Chinese
jetliner from the harbor near Hong Kong airport after the plane
skidded off the runway upon landing in a heavy rain Wednesday,
killing seven people.
   The dead were six crew members and a Hong Kong passenger who
died of his injuries in a hospital.
   The crew members' bodies were found in the front part of the
British-made Trident, which was submerged just off Kai Tak
International Airport's only runway, said Tsui Hin-cheuk,
divisional fire commander.
   The jetliner, operated by Civil Aviation Administration of
China, the nation's flag carrier, skidded off the runway in a
rainstorm at 9:19 a.m. (9:19 p.m. EDT Tuesday) as it landed on a
flight from Canton, capital of China's southern Guangdong province,
about 90 miles to the northwest.
   Fifteen of the 89 people on board Flight 301 were injured,
including two of the 12 American passengers, said the airline,
known as CAAC. Thirteen people were hospitalized in fair and
satisfactory condition.
   Radio Television Hong Kong said that besides the Americans, the
injured included three Chinese crew members, seven passengers from
Hong Kong, two from Taiwan and a Frenchman. Hospital officials
identified one of the injured as Heung Cheuk-Wu, a 38-year-old
Chinese-American.
   ``You know, today the weather is not very good,'' CAAC station
manager Chen Zhengyou said when asked about the cause of the crash.
China's official Xinhua News Agency also blamed the weather.
   Hong Kong officials launched an investigation. A London
spokesman for British Aerospace PLC, which makes the Trident, said
the company offered to help.
   CAAC said the pilot was among the dead, and Civil Aviation
Department spokesman Alex Wong said investigators hoped to retrieve
the plane's flight recorder.
   The rescue operation involved a floating crane, divers, a small
flotilla of rescue craft and five air force helicopters.
   Tsui said one of the engines was on fire when rescue teams
arrived. Officials said rescuers saved at least two people who were
trapped in the fuselage after the crash.
   ``There were a few big bumps and there we were, in the water,''
said Willemm Goudswaard, a Dutch survivor. ``When the people
realized that the plane was on the water they calmed down very
quickly.''
   Kiyotaka Fukasawa, a 60-year-old Japanese passenger, told
reporters that as soon as the plane hit the water, a flight
attendant opened an emergency door so passengers could scramble
onto a wing and wait for rescuers.
   Government-run Radio Television Hong Kong interviewed an
unidentified passenger who said some of the plane's seat belts did
not work and when the plane ``landed so hard, people simply were
flying.''
   The crash shut down Kai Tak, a major hub for Southeast Asia, for
more than six hours. It remained open through the night to handle
the backlog.
   Kai Tak is one of the most difficult airports to land in because
pilots must maneuver over high-rise buildings on their approach.
   Its worst accident was in 1967, when a Thai International flight
crashed into the harbor and killed 24 of 73 people on board.
   CAAC bought 35 Tridents between 1972 and 1978 from Hawker
Siddeley, whose aviation and defense businesses became part of
British Aerospace when it was nationalized in 1977. British
Aerospace has since been privatized.
   CAAC flies 490 planes on more than 300 domestic and
international routes. It reported a record 12.5 million passengers
last year.

<HEAD>Republicans Criticize Dukakis on Pardons But Records Show GOP Not
as Tough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
has come under Republican fire for granting pardons to more than
230 ex-convicts since 1983, but records show he has been tougher on
the issue than his GOP predecessors.
   The Massachusetts Civic Interest Council, in a report released
Tuesday, said the governor pardoned 232 people between 1983 and
1987, clearing their records of crimes ranging from manslaughter _
five cases _ to breaking and entering _ 136 cases.
   Twenty-one of Dukakis' pardons _ nearly one out of 10 _ were
granted to people convicted of selling or possessing with intent to
sell drugs.
   The council, a non-profit, research organization founded and
initially funded by state GOP Chairman Ray Shamie, claims no ties
to the Republican leader. And Bull Purdun, president of the
council, said it was not trying to make ``an overall judgment''
about Dukakis.
   But state GOP Executive Director Alexander Tennant said the
report ``is a clear indication that Mike Dukakis is a very liberal,
left-wing person. He says one thing about being tough on crime and
he does another.''
   However, figures provided by the governor's statehouse press
office show that Dukakis has granted fewer pardons than his
predecessors.
   Republican governor John Volpe granted 1,324 pardons between
1965 and 1968, and GOP Frank Sargent granted 1,755 pardons between
1969 and 1974.
   Dukakis granted 552 pardons during his first term from 1975 to
1978. He was followed by Democrat-later-to-turn-Republican Edward
King, who granted 211 pardons from 1979 to 1982.
   Although Dukakis granted more pardons between 1983 and 1987 than
King did during his administration, the number of pardons Dukakis
allowed during a comparable four-year period was actually less _
192.
   The 232 pardons granted by Dukakis between 1983 and 1987 came
from 550 requests submitted to the Advisory Board of Pardons, a
committee of the state Parole Board. The full parole board
recommended 247 of those be granted, and Dukakis rejected 15 of
them.
   David McGrath, executive assistant to the state Parole Board,
said the board considers a pardon ``an extraordinary form of
relief.''
   ``It is founded on the principle that people ought to be able to
put their problems behind them if they have exhibited extended
periods of good citizenship and deserve forgiveness by the
commonwealth,'' he said.
   The pardoning process is an extensive one that includes input
from the courts, the police and the prosecutors familiar with each
applicant. Besides the Parole Board, the governor's legal counsel
and the eight-member elected Governor's Council review the
applications.
   While the number of pardons has been decreasing, the number of
criminals being sent to state prisons has increased by 40 percent
between 1983 and 1987 and the crime rate has dropped 13.4 percent,
said Dave Wood, a Dukakis press aide.
   In 1983, 2,035 people were sent to state prisons. In 1987, there
were 2,853. Of that increase in 818 inmates, 72 percent of them
were convicted of drug-related crimes, Wood said.
   ``Very simply there are more people going to jail and there are
hard clear increases in the number of drug offenders going to
jail,'' Wood said. ``And by same token, we are looking at fewer
pardons.''

   Family members searched for loved
ones missing after an air show crash killed at least 48 people.
Injured children lay unclaimed in hospitals as officials tried to
determine if their parents were among the dead.
   Earlier, officials said the death toll was 49.
Rhineland-Palatinate state spokesman Juergen Dietzen said today a
4-year-old boy in serious condition was erroneously listed as dead.
   But U.S. Air Force spokeswoman Maj. Kathy White said revised
figures showed 52 people were dead. On Tuesday, the Pentagon
announced 40 people died, six of them U.S. citizens.
   On Sunday, three of 10 jets in an Italian air force stunt team
collided, one careening into the crowd at the annual air show at
the U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein.
   By this evening, 25 of the dead were identified, said Dietzen.
He said 166 injured were being treated at hospitals.
   The identified dead included the three pilots, 20 West Germans,
a Dutchman and a Frenchman, he said.
   Dietzen said no Americans were among the identified dead. But
chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said six Americans were known
to be among those killed.
   The Italian air force official who coordinated the team's stunts
said one plane caused the crash by flying into an intersecting
maneuver at the wrong altitude and speed.
   It was that pilot's jet, having crossed solo through two passing
formations, that tumbled into the crowd.
   A local prosecutor said today he started a probe into the crash
as required by West German law, but said it probably would not lead
to a criminal trial.
   Wilhelm Sattler, chief prosecutor in the neighboring town of
Kaiserlautern, said legal restrictions virtually bar bringing U.S.
and Italian officers before a German court in a criminal trial in a
case like the Ramstein crash. He also said West Germany has no
jurisdiction over the base.
   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily newspaper reported
today that the leftist Greens party filed a criminal complaint
against the base commander ``for negligent manslaughter and
negligent bodily harm.''Greens are known for their anti-NATO stance.
   Seven Americans remained hospitalized today in the U.S. Army
hospital in Landstuhl, spokeswoman Marie Shaw said, with an
undetermined number at other hospitals.
   Ms. Shaw said Jeffrey McCanch, his wife, Tammy, and their
2{-year-old son, Jeffrey Jr., were taken from the hospital today
and placed on a flight to Brooke Army Medical Center in San
Antonio, Texas.
   Arriving at the center today were Air Force Master Sgt. Stephen
Hull, 32, of Covina, Calif.; Army 1st Lt. Kim Strader, 30, of Salt
Lake City; Army Pfc. Myron Riggs, 24, of Pittsburgh; and Anderea
DelaRosa, 33, an Italian sergeant major.
   Sgt. Barry Grossman, a Ramstein base spokesman, said today that
U.S. officials were still not ready to release the names of the
dead and injured.
   Opposition to military air shows mushroomed. NATO allies
suspended future air shows as they tried to figure out how to make
them safer. Many West Germans _ including some of those injured
Sunday _ demanded the shows be banned.
   ``Now I take warnings about the dangers of air shows seriously.
I didn't before,'' said Karl Eggenweiler of Rothenberg-am-Neckar,
whose back and arms were severely burned and who will likely be
scarred for life.
   ``Now I think these shows should be forbidden,'' he said from
his bed at Kaiserslautern hospital.
   In a poll by the respected Wickert Institute, 82 percent of the
2,710 West Germans surveyed said they want all military air shows
stopped. Only 18 percent said they did not want the shows stopped,
the institute said.
   Dietzen said police received scores of reports of missing people
after the crash.
   ``There are even cases of people from as far away as America who
have said `my relative has been on vacation there for three weeks,
and we haven't heard a word. Is it possible they were at
Ramstein?','' he said.
   West Germany's ARD television showed pictures of a special
missing persons bureau set up after the disaster in Kaiserslautern.
   ``I'm looking for my sister,'' said one unidentified German man.
``The whole family didn't come home.''
   The West German newspaper Bild said authorities searched in vain
for the parents of two badly burned girls _ 6-year-old Nadine and
10-year-old Melanie _ who were taken to a hospital in Oggersheim.
   One unconscious boy thought to be about 13 also had not been
identified, the Frankfurt Abendpost newspaper said. Doctors at a
hospital in Offenbach near Frankfurt said he was burned over 95
percent of his body.
   Meanwhile, some criticized rescue operations at the show.
   ``One eyewitness said that he held one of the injured in his
arms for 20 minutes waiting for help,'' the Frankfurter Allgemeine
newspaper said. ``A doctor said the organization of the air show
was not prepared for such a catastrophe.'' The newspaper did not
identify the sources.
   Wolfgang Herbig, director of the Kaiserslautern hospital, told
reporters he felt there were not enough mobile medical teams
available at the air show.
   But the Rhineland-Palatinate state Interior Ministry defended
the rescue efforts as ``quick, level-headed'' and praised the
cooperation between the Americans and Germans.

<HEAD>Senior Citizens Group To Launch Anti-Bush Drive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Council of Senior Citizens said
Wednesday it is launching a campaign to dog Republican nominee
George Bush on the campaign trail with signs reminding him of his
1985 vote in favor of a freeze on Social Security benefits.
   The council, which claims 4.5 million members, said it will
undertake a massive distribution of voting records, literature and
lawn signs to turn out older voters on behalf of Democrat Michael
Dukakis for the Nov. 8 election.
   The group, created in the 1960s as an offshoot of organized
labor to lobby for passage of Medicare, is planning news
conferences on Thursday in 14 cities in Wisconsin, Illinois,
California, Washington state and Ohio to publicize its stand.
   Its posters read, ``Bush whacked my Social Security on May 9,
1985. Vote Dukakis.''
   Bush cast a tie-breaking vote on that date to defeat an
amendment to exempt Social Security cost-of-living increases from a
proposed federal budget freeze for 1986. However, President Reagan
refused to endorse the freeze and it never became law.

<HEAD>Toxic Waste Ship Sails Away From Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ship carrying toxic waste that the
government refused to accept for disposal sailed away Wednesday
after two days in international waters off Britain.
   The destination of the Karin B, loaded with 2,100 tons of
industrial solvents, was unknown, said a port control official in
this southern city.
   The wastes, which originated in Italy, were dumped secretly and
illegally in Nigeria and then removed in two shiploads by
contractors for Italian authorities.
   The Karin B, which left Nigeria July 30, was rejected by Spanish
and Welsh ports before appearing off Plymouth on Monday, said the
environmental group Friends of the Earth. West Germany also said it
would not accept the waste.
   A second ship, the Deep Sea Carrier, sailed from Nigeria Aug. 15
carrying 1,000 tons of the solvents reportedly for Revenna, Italy,
which objected strongly to accepting the cargo. It showed up off
Gibraltar and was off Portugal Wednesday, said the environmental
group.
   The port official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
passing ship tried to contact the West German-owned ship on the
radio but received no answer.
   The Environment Department refused comment.
   An Italian Embassy official, Enrico Augelli, said, ``Wherever it
will go it will be a place where it can be treated in a safe way.''
   On Tuesday, Junior Environment Minister Virginia Bottomley said
the waste could not be brought into Britain because it did not meet
waste laws. She said the waste was ``essentially an Italian
problem.''
   Environmentalists said the government had lax standards that
attracted the ship to British waters.
   British law allow waste disposal companies to accept toxic waste
from the United States and European countries for incineration or
burial.
   Throughout the furor, Italian officials maintained their
government was not involved and that the Italian national waste
firm Ambienti had to decide what to do.
   Italian authorities designated Ambienti to dispose of the waste
left in Koko on the banks of the Niger River. The Italian
government said it did not have the technology to get rid of the
waste.
   British lawmakers from the opposition Labor and governing
Conservative parties called for an investigation, even though the
ship left.

<TEXT>
   A former Israeli district court judge said
Wednesday he will represent Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk when
he appeals his conviction and death sentence because ``every man
deserves to be defended.''
   Dov Eitan will join another Israeli and a Canadian lawyer in the
appeal before a panel of five Supreme Court judges in December.
   A three-judge panel headed by Supreme Court judge Dov Levine
ruled that Demjanjuk, 68, was ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a sadistic
guard at the Treblinka death camp who operated gas chambers that
killed 850,000 Jews during World War II.
   The Ukranian-born retired autoworker was sentenced to death on
April 25.
   Eitan, 53, served for 17 years on the Jerusalem District Court
bench before retiring in 1983. The weekly magazine Koteret Rashit
said his involvement in the trial would add prestige to the defense.
   Eitan's Israeli colleague, Yoram Sheftel, who defended Demjanjuk
from the start of the trial in February 1987, was widely criticized
by Israelis for defending Demjanjuk.
   But Eitan said he was not worried about public reaction to his
decision to defend Demjanjuk.
   ``I'm a lawyer. Demjanjuk's family appealed to me and after
lengthy consideration I decided the case was worth defending. Every
man deserves to be defended,'' Eitan said in an interview.
   Demjanjuk, who lived in a Cleveland suburb before being
extradited to Israel, claimed he was a victim of mistaken identity.
   The trial aroused strong emotions in Israel, and onlookers
clapped and cheered when Demjanjuk was given the death penalty.

<HEAD>Official Doesn't Expect Asian Policy Change Under Bush, Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. defense policy toward Asia will change
very little regardless of who is elected the next president, a
senior Pentagon official predicted Wednesday.
   ``Whether it is President (George) Bush or President (Michael)
Dukakis, policies toward Asia will more or less stay on the same
course,'' said Carl Jackson, deputy assistant secretary of defense
for international security affairs. He also declared it unlikely
the United States would end its military presence in either South
Korea or the Southeast Asian region.
   Rejecting contentions that the United States provides Japan ``a
free ride'' on defense burdens, Jackson told a news conference that
lingering hostility in Asia from World War II provides ``real
limits beyond which Japan would be well-advised not to go'' in
military spending.
   There may be some ``fine tuning'' of policy, but under a
traditional American principle that ``if it ain't broke, don't fix
it,'' the next U.S. president would make few if any basic changes,
Jackson said.
   This is because ``basically our relationships with China, Japan,
the Philippines, with Korea have been great successes through the
last 10 years,'' he said.
   He also predicted both the current review of the agreement on
U.S. bases in the Philippines and its eventual renegotiation will
conclude with a new arrangement because that ``is in the best
interest of the Republic of the Philippines and in the best
interests of the United States ....''
   Jackson said he rules out withdrawal of the approximately 42,000
U.S. military personnel from South Korea because their presence has
been ``a great success'' in deterring any major outbreak of war
since the 1953 Korean armistice.

   One of 34 people who boarded Delta
Airlines Flight 1141 here walked away with only a scratch after the
plane crashed in Texas, and told her father today she stayed to
help those injured.
   Melissa Jane Lewis, 24, of Tupelo, ``told me she was sitting
beside an escape door over a wing, and when it crashed she hit the
ground running,'' said her father Jordan D. Lewis. ``She told me
she only got a scratch on one leg.''
   Thirty-four people boarded the jet here and six of them held
tickets to Salt Lake City, said Delta district marketing manager
George Tribble. The jet, with more than 100 people aboard, crashed
on takeoff from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport en route to
Utah, officials said.
   Barbara Mosal of Jackson said she was notified that her husband,
Dr. David Mosal, was in a Dallas hospital. ``He's alive. He has an
injury to his shoulder and his back but he is alive _ he did
survive.''
   Lewis, 58, said in a telephone interview from his Tupelo
dentist's office that his daughter told him the plane broke in two
after hitting the ground, and that after escaping ``she returned to
help the injured.
   ``She didn't feel very comfortable about what happened but she
seemed to be in pretty good spirits.''
   Ms. Lewis was going to California for a job interview, he said.
``She was to return home tomorrow night, but now I don't know when
to expect her back.''
   No unusual activity was reported at the airport after the crash,
and Tribble said his office had received no calls ``from local
people saying my son or daughter was on that flight.''

<HEAD>Hundreds Strike Briefly, Demand Reinstatement of Manager</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>

   About 250 workers at a regional optical
instruments plant went on strike for several hours Wednesday and
won the reinstatement of a fired manager, a news agency reported.
   Isvan Toth, the manager of the Visorama plant in the northern
town of Esztergom, was dismissed Tuesday, the official MTI news
agency reported without giving any reasons for the decision. It
said the Visorama strikers described Toth's dismissal as ``unfair''
and rejected the newly appointed manager.
   Defending Toth, the strikers said he fulfilled his duties for
four years ``to their satisfaction'' and requested that the
Esztergom facility be left independent from the financially
troubled Granvisus parent company in Budapest.
   The report said that after some seven hours of talks with a
representative of the Ministry of Industry and local Communist
Party and trade union officials, ``the employees came to an
agreement with the (general) manager of the parent company, who
announced that he restored Istvan Toth to his former managerial
post.''
   According to MTI, the representative promised the workers that
his office would study the request for independence of their plant
from the parent company.
   Although labor unrest is rare in Hungary, more than 300 workers
at a mine in the southern part of the country went on strike for 20
hours on Aug. 25 that represented the first worker challenge to the
stringent economic policies of premier Karoly Grosz.
   The miners at Kolmo, some 100 miles south of Budapest, had
complained that because of a quirk in tax laws introduced at the
beginning of this year, workers on sick leave could earn more than
those working regularly.

<HEAD>Bush Pledges to Reduce Acid Rain</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, standing on the shore of
Lake Erie, proclaimed himself a lifelong environmentalist on
Wednesday and pledged to reduce acid rain on a ``set timetable.''
   ``I will work out the exact amounts and the exact methodology
with Congress,'' Bush said in a speech that aides said was designed
to contrast the vice president's environmental views from Reagan
administration policy.
   ``But the waiting period for action on acid rain is over ... we
must have a clear commitment to emissions reductions on a set
timetable,'' he said.
   The Republican presidential nominee also said he would convene a
global conference during his first year in the White House to
address the ``greenhouse'' effect. He called for protection of
natural wetlands and said he wants to ``insure that zero tolerance
is applied not only to those who poison our children's minds with
drugs, but to those who poison our water with toxic chemicals.''
   After several days of campaigning through the South, Bush chose
a key Midwestern battleground state to open a new front in his
campaign for the White House.
   One aide conceded that Bush probably trails Democrat Michael
Dukakis in Michigan, which has 20 electoral votes, although
Republicans express confidence they will carry the state.
   Bush's brief trip blended new campaign proposals in a
made-for-television setting near Lake Erie, which has undergone
significant cleanup in recent years. The vice president took a
brief walk along the lake's sandy shore, and cast a fishing line
into the water as he stopped to talk with a family on an outing.
   ``You ever go for the walleyes?'' asked Bush, an avid fisherman.
   For the first time in several days, Bush made no mention of
Dukakis. But aides said he would couple his environmental themes
with a more aggressive campaign style Thursday with a trip to
Boston Harbor, a highly polluted site in Dukakis' home state.
   Nor did Bush mention Reagan by name during the day. ``These are
George Bush policies. This is what I will do when I'm elected
president,'' he said when asked whether he was advocating stronger
policies than Reagan has pursued.
   But aides traveling with the vice president said his commitment
on acid rain was drafted with just such an idea in mind.
   Reagan has come under attack from environmentalists for dragging
his feet on solving the acid rain problem during his two-term
tenure. Earlier this month, however, the president gave the
go-ahead for continuing negotiations toward U.S. participation in
an international treaty to freeze emissions of nitrogen oxides, a
precursor to acid rain.
   ``On the question of acid rain, the time for study alone has
passed,'' Bush said. ``We know enough to begin taking steps to
limit future damage ... as president, I will ask for a program to
cut millions of tons of sulfer dioxide emissions by the year 2,000
and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well.''
   The vice president offered no specifics.
   Bush also said the Superfund has sufficient money to handle
cleanup of toxic waste sites and said the Environmental Protection
Agency should move aggressivly against those responsibile for
dumping.
   ``Polluters should pay,'' he said. ``I am an environmentalist,
always have been, from my earliest days growing up and then as a
congressman ... and I always will be... that's not inconsistent
with being a businessman nor is it with being a conservative.''
   The campaign trip was plagued by the latest in a string of
aircraft problems when a United Airlines jet chartered to fly
reporters to Michigan developed problems and was unable to fly.
   A replacement plane was brought in, but didn't reach Michigan
until after Bush had finished his speech. Reporters on board
arrived in time to see the vice president pay a visit to the
Michigan State Fair.

<HEAD>Report: Prosecution Against Writers Continues In 29 Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Persecution against writers continues
in at least 29 nations despite notable improvements in the Soviet
Union, with an estimated 305 authors imprisoned worldwide, a report
said Wednesday.
   ``In all parts of the world, there are cases of censorship or
attempts at censorship,'' said Francis King, president of P.E.N.,
the London-based association of writers and literary figures that
is meeting in Seoul and issued the report.
   The report from P.E.N.'s influential ``Writers in Prison''
committee said the number of novelists, poets, playwrights and
journalists known to be imprisoned in 1988 was 305, or 35 less than
one year ago.
   ``The decrease is almost entirely explained by the new policy
against dissidents in the U.S.S.R.,'' the report said. ``In 1983,
93 Soviet writers and journalists were reported imprisoned, in
forced psychiatric confinement or internal exile. Today the
corresponding number is 20.''
   ``Despite the fact that numbers in prison are diminishing and
there are improvements in the treatment of writers in the Soviet
Union, Argentina and Chile,'' King said conditions worsened in
countries such as North Korea, Vietnam, Iran and South Africa.
   ``There is no solution,'' said King, a British novelist and
playwright, ``because there is no solution to human wickedness.''
He said the figures may be too low in some cases because
information is not available from every country.
   King said P.E.N. would continue pressing for the release of
those denied freedom of expression, in particular South Korea.
   Thomas von Vegesack, a publisher in Stockholm and chairman of
the ``Writers in Prison'' committee, which includes delegates from
20 nations, visited two of five literary figures in South Korean
jails this week.
   Von Vegesack said the 20-minute visits with journalist Kim
Hyon-jang and poet Kim Nam-ju were moving and emotional. He said
P.E.N. plans to ask South Korea's government to release the two,
plus publisher Lee Tae-bok and poet Lee San-ha, with whom visits
were denied.
   The Swedish publisher said he did not know enough about a fifth
prisoner, journalist Lee Pu-kyong, to comment on his case and his
committee had not asked to visit Lee.
   Von Vegesack also said P.E.N. would demand that the imprisoned
writers be immediately given the rights to write, to read all books
readily available in South Korea, and to see their lawyers.
   The committee examines in detail all cases involving imprisoned
writers, journalists and publishers, von Vegesack said.
   ``The quality of writing is not a factor,'' he said. ``The
committee deals with whoever gets in jail trying to express
opinion. P.E.N. is an apolitical organization, but we believe it's
not a crime to have political opinions.'' P.E.N. does not support
those arrested for criminal or violent activities, he added.
   Controversy has surrounded the Seoul meeting because it's
unusual to hold a P.E.N. congress in a country where writers are in
prison. The last time that occurred was 1979 in Brazil.
   The East German delegation boycotted the meeting. Some Korean
writers also have boycotted the meeting, saying they would not
attend until their colleagues were released from jail.
   ``Many members think it's not nice to go to banquets when there
are colleagues in prison,'' von Vegesack said.
   The ``Writers in Prison'' committee was even approached, he
said, by representatives from North Korea ``who wanted to give us
information not about the situation in their own country, but about
the situation in South Korea.'' He said the committee ignored the
overture.

   The California schools chief said 38
elementary schools tampered with answers on the annual state
standarized test, considered the top indicator of a school's
performance, according to a published report.
   School chief Bill Honig said he doesn't know who is to blame,
but that letters were sent to district superintendents telling them
of schools with ``questionable erasures and responses,'' the San
Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday.
   ``It's up to them to take disciplinary action,'' said Honig, the
state superintendent of public instruction. ``Our job is to give
them the information.''
   Honig said a teacher or principal who cheats ``should get
canned.''
   The offending schools' scores were dropped from records of the
1985-86 California Assessment Program.
   The state's 4,600 elementary schools gave the multiple choices
tests on math, reading and writing.
   The tampering was found when a computer identified 120 schools
with a statistically high number of eraser marks on test booklets.
State officials then went over each book and found that 38 schools
had an unusually high number of wrong answers erased and corrected.
   ``When you had a high number of incorrects going to corrects,
something was fishy,'' Honig said.

<TEXT>
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle has received more negative coverage than any national
candidate except Gary Hart, according to a study of network evening
news programs released Wednesday.
   Researchers from the Center for Media and Public Affairs said
ABC, CBS and NBC broadcast 93 stories on the Indiana senator from
Aug. 16, when he was selected, to Aug. 28. The following night
there were no stories on him.
   The cumulative airtime was three hours and 22 minutes _ ``more
than one-quarter of all evening news broadcasts for nearly two
weeks after his nomination,'' said the researchers.
   Evaluations of Quayle by reporters and non-partisan analysts
were positive only 33 percent of the time, according to the study.
The researchers called that ratio ``worse than any candidate
received during the primaries aside from Gary Hart's 21 percent
positive rating.''
   By contrast, they said, Republican presidential nominee George
Bush had a 49 percent positive rating during the primary season and
his Democratic counterpart, Michael Dukakis, had a 58 percent
rating.
   The latest study showed that Quayle's service in the Indiana
National Guard was the most common topic, appearing in 50 of the 93
evening news stories. His background of privilege dominated 19
stories, his relationship to lobbyist Paula Parkinson arose in 13
stories and his good looks came up in 10 stories.
   Quayle was called a conservative 24 times in 12 days, the
researchers reported. All the Republican primary candidates
combined were called conservative only 27 times during 18 months of
campaigning, they said.
   The non-partisan, non-profit Center for Media and Public
Affairs, directed by social scientists Robert and Linda Lichter,
has been analyzing evening news coverage since the start of the
primary season. The results are published in a newsletter called
Media Monitor.

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Wednesday called on
the Chilean government to create conditions to ensure that the
national plebiscite set for Oct. 5 is carried out peacefully.
   Deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Chilean authorities must
``create an atmosphere in which citizens can exercise their freedom
of choice without fear or intimidation so that Chile can take its
rightful place in the community of democratic nations.''
   The statement came a day after Chile's military commanders
nominated President Augusto Pinochet as the only candidate in a
presidential referendum. He will remain as president until 1997 if
he receives majority support but an open election will take place
within a year if the voters reject him.
   Mrs. Oakley urged the Chilean government to take additional
steps to ensure that both sides in the upcoming plebiscite have
equal access to the media. She said a new law authorizing free
television time to opposing views improves conditions for a free
and fair plebiscite.
   ``The government of Chile and especially its armed forces have
an important responsibility to assure its citizens that there will
be a free plebiscite under peaceful conditions,'' she said.

   The State Department praised on Wednesday the
Polish government's decision to open contacts with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa, calling the move a ``welcome and significant
step forward.''
   Deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley noted that the United States
has long encouraged Polish authorities to ``take the path of
dialogue and national reconciliation.''
   Mrs. Oakley spoke shortly after Walesa concluded a three-hour
meeting with communist officials, the first encounter of its kind
since Solidarity was banned in 1982.
   ``Economic and political reforms can succeed if they enjoy the
confidence of the Polish people,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   She expressed hope the government of Poland is prepared to work
with leaders such a Walesa, who are ``widely admired and trusted by
the Polish people.''
   The United States is also hopeful, she said, that this initial
meeting will lead to further steps and to ``substantial progress,
with all sides working constructively together. In a process of
real national reconciliation and reform, there are no losers, only
winners.''

<HEAD>Newspaper says Hero Worker's Life Ruined by Soviet Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Josef Stalin and his successor, Nikita Khrushchev,
drove the nation's showcase hard worker to drink and ruined his
family by promoting him to paper-shuffling jobs, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   Alexei Stakhanov was quickly ignored after his record-breaking
coal mining feat in the 1930s that made him a hero worker, the
labor newspaper Trud said.
   ``Stakhanov was thrown out and forgotten,'' Trud said. ``That is
how short the administrative-command (system's) memory turned out
to be. The Stalinist system needed a symbol, a poster, and not a
living person.''
   Stakhanov became a legend in the Soviet Union for setting a
world production record for coal. On Aug. 31, 1935, he drilled 102
tons of coal in six hours, 14 times the norm for one shift.
   Western historians say the feat, performed at a Donetsk basin
mine, was contrived. They say all other work was stopped in
Stakhanov's section of the mine and that a whole gang performed
auxiliary work that normally had to be done by the man at the coal
face. This explanation has not been reported in Soviet media,
apparently so as not to diminish the value of the feat.
   The achievement started a nationwide ``speed-up'' movement in
which workers, nicknamed ``Stakhanovites,'' competed for bonuses
and privileges by setting fantastic output records.
   Wednesday's article represented another attempt under Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, to
recount history more accurately.
   It also was another blow to Stalin, who is widely criticized in
the official media now for developing a ``cult of personality,''
killing millions of people including loyal Communist Party members
in bloody purges, and overcentralizing the Soviet economy.
   Like other Soviet leaders recalling the hard-working spirit of
Stakhanov, Gorbachev has stressed the need to increase
productivity. But _ in addition to working harder _ he has promised
people a program of improved technology and accompanied the calls
for higher quantity production with a drive for better quality
goods.
   Stakhanov received many awards, a better apartment and was wined
and dined by Soviet officials including Stalin. He did not,
however, fare well in the long term, Trud said.
   The newspaper said that in 1936, Stakhanov was torn away from
his favorite work and brought to Moscow to become a bureaucrat. He
was made section chief of socialist competitions and awards.
   ``For 25 whole years after that, his name disappeared from
newspaper and magazine pages, from documentary films. His voice
wasn't heard from a speaker's stand,'' Trud said.
   The new job turned Stakhanov into an alcoholic, the newspaper
said.
   ``He didn't do anything in particular. With the strong hands
that were created for a man's real work, he was shuffling paper and
in the evening not infrequently poured himself vodka of
bitterness,'' Trud said.
   His lot did not improve under Khrushchev, who came to power in
1953. When a foreign visitor asked the Soviet leader in 1957 what
had become of Stakhanov, he said the hero worker was still in
Donbass, the area where he set the production record, according to
Trud.
   But Stakhanov actually was in Moscow, and when Khrushchev
learned of this later, he had the miner sent back to the region.
Stakhanov only had 24 hours' notice of the move and left his wife
and children behind in the capital. Local officials ignored him.
   He died a lonely and depressed man in 1977, Trud said.
   Stakhanov still serves as an example for Soviet workers, Trud
said, and for that ``will remain in the people's memory as an
outstanding worker and patriot.''

<TEXT>
   Residents voted at an emotional town
meeting to recommend that a modern-style house erroneously
constructed in the town's historic district be allowed to stand.
   A crowd of more than 300 spilled out of the Canterbury
Elementary School into the parking lot Tuesday night in the town
meeting called to try to resolve the dispute.
   ``It's not just an issue of technicalities,'' said Winofred
Wingate, one of the community's 1,500 residents. ``It's an issue of
the quality and the spirit of how we deal with these issues.''
   Fred and Janet Sallah were granted a building permit for a
round, two-story redwood house, because the map used by town
officials erroneously indicated their lot was outside the historic
district. Within the district, new buildings are supposed to follow
traditional New England style.
   A second house was also approved erroneously, but its
architecture is not so unconventional. Town officials propose that
the house, a ranch-style building, would fit in if it is covered in
wood shingles.
   Residents approved one proposal Tuesday by a voice vote to have
the Sallahs ask the town zoning board for a variance, with the
board taking note that public sentiment favors approval. Sallah
said later he would be willing to make such a request. But the
zoning board has already turned down the couple's request for an
exemption.
   By a vote of 177-114, residents also voted Tuesday to recommend
a referendum on the November ballot to redraw the boundaries of the
historic district to exclude the Sallahs' house, the ranch-style
house and one other nearby house.
   But many residents argued that changing the historic district
would set a bad precedent.
   ``I am unwilling to pay the price of scrapping our zoning
ordinance, which we have protected for 18 years, as a solution to
Mr. Sallah's problem,'' said Sabin Guertin, a Canterbury resident
for 65 years.
   The Sallahs have taken the issue to Merrimack County Superior
Court and have stopped work on the house, which is enclosed but not
finished inside. The owners of the ranch-style home also are
appealing the zoning board's requirement that they put shingles on
the house.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The warring Moslem and Christian
communities of Lebanon proposed contradictory solutions Wednesday
to the 13-year-old conflict that has claimed 130,000 lives.
   Justice Minister Nabih Berri, head of the Syrian-backed
mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal movement, called for an end to the
``First Republic'' that has given Maronite Catholics dominance over
Lebanon since independence was gained from France 45 years ago.
   ``I hereby declare the end of the First Republic in Lebanon by
burying the system of the 1943 covenant and the creation of the
Second Lebanese Republic based on Lebanon's Arab calling,
sovereignty, independence and justice,'' Berri said.
   Berri was referring to an unwritten covenant under which the
Maronites controlled the presidency, the army, Parliament and the
judiciary. The charter gave the Shiites the post of Parliament
speaker and the Sunni Moslems the prime minister's portfolio.
   Berri threatened that Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions
would not permit presidential elections if the demanded reforms
were not accepted before Sept. 23, when the six-year term of
President Amin Gemayel expires.
   But Samir Geagea, commander of the right-wing Christian Lebanese
forces militia, rejected Berri's proposals.
   ``We are ready, after the presidential elections, to meet with
all the Lebanese factions anywhere in Lebanon to discuss `entente.'
Presidential elections should be held first,'' Geagea said.
   Entente, in Lebanese political parlance, refers to a formula of
coexistence accepted by the various warring factions.
   Parliament failed Aug. 18 to muster a quorum to elect a
president to succeed Gemayel when only 38 deputies showed up at
Parliament's headquarters in Beirut. The only serious candidate was
Syrian-backed former President Suleiman Franjieh.
   Moslem and leftist factions accused the Lebanese Forces of
preventing parliamentary deputies from taking part in the session,
in order to block the election of Franjieh, a personal friend of
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   Franjieh, 78, holds Geagea responsible for the June 1978 killing
of his elder son, Tony; Tony's wife; and 3-year-old daughter, along
with 30 followers in a raid on the family's summer mansion in the
northern town of Ehden.
   Gegea made his remark at a news conference in Christian east
Beirut as Berri addressed a mass rally in south Beirut to
commemorate the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of the
Shiites' religious leader in Lebanon, Imam Moussa Sadr.
   Sadr, who founded Amal in 1974 and headed the Supreme Shiite
Islamic Council, disappeared Aug. 31, 1978, during a visit to
Libya. Amal has accused the Libyans of holding him. Libya denied
the charge.
   Berri called on Moslem and leftist militias to ``jointly
confront the threat and achieve victory.''
   ``We should have the closest possible ties with Syria,'' Berri
added.
   Geagea called on Franjieh to withdraw his candidacy because
``the Syrians want to ruin Lebanon.''
   The Lebanese Forces, known for their close ties with Israel, are
Syria's main foe in Lebanon. Syria, the principal power broker in
Lebanon, has about 40,000 troops in eastern and northern parts of
the country and in west and south Beirut.

   A Delta Air Lines jetliner carrying more
than 100 people crashed and burned on takeoff today at Dallas-Fort
Worth Airport, killing at least nine and injuring more than 30,
officials said.
   The Boeing 727 en route to Salt Lake City went down in hazy
sunshine, broke in two and burst into flames on a flat, grassy
field near the runway. Many passengers climbed to safety through a
blackened hole in the top of the cabin.
   Passengers on another flight who watched in horror as the plane
tipped to one side and went down chanted ``Get up! Get up!,'' a
witness said.
   ``There was pandemonium. People were jumping on the plane's wing
and burning themselves on it because it was so red hot,'' said a
survivor, Jim Hammack. ``We got out of the way fast because we
thought it was going to explode.''
   ``You could see the fuel running down the window and down the
wing, and I wasn't going to get burned,'' he said.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said at least nine people were killed
and that about 60 survivors were healthy enough to continue on
their way. The three pilots survived, although one suffered a
severe back injury, he said.
   At least 32 people were admitted to seven hospitals, hospital
officials said, but their condition was not immediately known.
Other passengers were treated and released. Most of the injured
suffered burns, cuts or broken bones.
   ``The plane had slid sideways about the last 100 yards on the
ground. It wasn't a violent crash. It wasn't cartwheeling or
anything like that,'' said Jerry Weeks, who works for an airport
shuttle bus service and talked to some of the injured.
   ``They had no idea what happened,'' Weeks said.
   The fire was brought under control quickly, but the partially
blackened, split-open fuselage smoldered more than an hour after
the 9:03 a.m. accident.
   Flight 1141, which originated in Jackson, Miss., carried more
than 97 passengers and seven crew members, but the exact number was
not known because infants are not on passenger lists, Berry said.
   ``The important thing is that the airplane was 1,000 feet from
the end of the runway,'' Berry said. ``This had to aid rescue
efforts.''
   Berry earlier reported 15 and then 11. He said those figures
were based on erroneous reports from hospital officials and people
at the scene.
   Investigators had no immediate indication of the cause of the
crash, said Michael Benson, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   However, a source involved in the federal investigation said
early indications were that the jet took an unusually long time to
become airborne, that it climbed to only about 80 feet, and that
the left wing struck the runway first. The source spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   An NTSB team of investigators was sent to the scene. The Boeing
727 is one of the most popular commercial jetliners ever made,
flown by more than 170 carriers.
   Penn Waugh, an uninjured passenger, said the plane ``never got
in the air.''
   ``I heard a noise _ I knew something was wrong,'' Waugh said.
Within a minute, the plane was in flames, he said. The plane broke
in two, and passengers began scrambling through the roof, he said.
   Rick Arnett, an attorney from Austin, said he was on a Delta
flight that had just landed when the plane went down.
   ``It was tipping as it was taking off. It was already tipping to
the right and then, as it crossed in front of us, it never was able
to get altitude,'' he said. ``A lot of people on the left side of
our plane we're saying, `Get up, get up' when they saw it coming
right in front of us.''
   Clive Lane said he saw the plane from his window before it
crashed.
   ``I noticed the tail was sort of hanging down, like, you know,
it shouldn't have been,'' he said. ``And then I saw red sparks
starting at the back of the tail, and I thought that's not its
light, that's a fire. Then I watched it put its tail into the
ground and exploded in a huge ball of fire.''
   Ambulances took injured from the site, and fire trucks sprayed
foam on the wreckage.
   Rescue teams in asbestos suits walked through the wreckage,
looking for passengers and spraying water on sections still aflame.
Ambulances drove onto and off the field where the jet crashed.
Several helicopters also flew in and out.
   The accident is the second at DFW involving Delta in three years.
   On Aug. 2, 1985, Delta Flight 191 crashed as it approached a
runway during a violent thunderstorm, killing 137 people, including
a motorist. The crash injured 25 others. The L-1011 jet was on a
flight from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Investigators determined that there was a wind shear, a violent
change in wind direction that can rob a plane of lift.
   On May 24, a Boeing 727 of the Costa Rican airline LACSA
exploded in flames on takeoff from San Jose, Costa Rica. No one was
seriously injured.

<HEAD>Law Assuring Timely Access to Money Takes Effect Thursday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal law guaranteeing customers of banks,
savings associations and credit unions timely access to money they
deposit by check takes effect Thursday.
   Congress passed the Expedited Funds Availability Act last year
after consumer groups complained that Americans were losing
millions of dollars a year in lost interest and unjustified
overdraft charges because some financial institutions were putting
holds as long as two weeks on funds deposited by check.
   However, bankers say most institutions were voluntarily meeting
deadlines for making funds available. They complain the new rules
are confusing and costly to implement and will make it more
difficult to detect phony or rubber checks.
   Here are some of the key provisions of Federal Reserve
regulations that implement the law:
   _Local checks written on a financial institution in the same
metropolitan area or within the same Federal Reserve
check-processing region must be available within three business
days.
   _Funds on non-local checks can be held for as many as seven days
after deposit.
   _Funds from cashier's checks, certified checks and government
checks must be made available for withdrawal by 9 a.m. on the next
business day after deposit.
   _Checks deposited through automatic-teller machines after 2 p.m.
will not be considered received until the next business day.
   _By Sept. 1, 1990, the hold period will shrink to two days for
local checks and five days for non-local checks.

<HEAD>Bentsen's Blind Trust Invested $564,000 in Son's Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The blind trust of Democratic vice presidential
nominee Lloyd Bentsen invested about $564,000 _ more than twice the
amount previously disclosed _ in a holding company that was formed
by his son last year but has conducted little business since then,
a published report said Wednesday.
   The Houston Post also reported that the company has been paying
the financially strapped Lan Bentsen nearly $10,000 a month for his
services as president and board chairman, according to a record of
his testimony in an Aug. 3 divorce hearing.
   Bentsen, the Texas senator, denied Tuesday that he influenced
the investment decision and said he saw nothing unusual about the
transaction. He acknowledged, however, that trust administrators
probably based their decision on what he would have done in the
same circumstances.
   ``I don't consider it unusual to consider how a father would
feel about the investment in his son's buisness,'' Bentsen said.
``I consider it an investment in my son's future.''
   In Washington, spokesman Bill Maddox said Wednesday that Bentsen
talked with the newspaper ``and expressed his views, so I wouldn't
have any comment in addition to what Senator Bentsen said to the
Post yesterday.''
   Bentsen, who is vacationing in rural Wyoming, was unavailable
for comment.
   Senate records show the investment originated as a personal loan
Bentsen made to his son in October 1986 for between $100,000 to
$250,000. Bentsen transferred the note receiveable to his trust in
August 1987.
   The trustee, Texas Commerce Bank, then decided to convert the
note to shares in Lan Bentsen's new business, Performance Property
Management, doing business as Sovereign Management Corp. The
trustee also committed additional funds at that time, The Post said.
   Federal ethics regulations require that when a public official's
assets are transferred to a blind trust, all investment decisions
are to be left to the trustee.
   Lan Bensten was questioned extensively about his finances during
the Aug. 3 hearing, which was held on a motion to reduce child
support in his pending divorce from his wife of 10 years, Lynne
Barlow Bentsen.
   He testified he operates 25 limited real estate partnerships and
joint ventures under a sole proprietorship called Lan Bentsen
Interests. The business currently earns no income, but has monthly
operating expenses of about $21,000, he testified.

<HEAD>Study Says One in Three Americans Inherit Colon Cancer Gene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gene inherited by a third of all white Americans
may be responsible for most cancer of the colon and rectum, and a
search is on to pinpoint this inborn cancer trigger, researchers
say.
   The study, to be published Thursday, suggests one gene _ or
perhaps several _ that are present at birth put some people at high
risk of developing adenomatous polyps. Colon and rectal cancers
develop from these growths.
   Researchers who conducted the work at the University of Utah say
they believe the still-unidentified genetic factor accounts for 50
percent to 100 percent of all cancer of the colon and rectum, which
strikes an estimated 147,000 Americans annually.
   ``This paper is of particular importance, because it points to
the fact that a single gene may underlie a significant portion of
all cases of colon cancer,'' said Dr. Michael Swift of the
University of North Carolina. ``It gives, in principle, a way of
getting to that gene and identifying it.''
   Dr. Randall W. Burt, a co-author of the Utah study, said that
locating the gene is one of his team's goals. ``We think we have a
fairly good chance of one day finding the gene or genes,'' he said.
   Until now, many experts believed that inheritance played only a
minor role in colon cancer.
   However, inheriting the gene does not mean that one is destined
to have cancer. Other studies have shown that only about 5 percent
of adenomatous polyps go on to become cancerous. The researchers
believe other genetic factors or diet may play a role in turning
the polyps cancerous in people who inherit the gene.
   ``We are not saying that genes are the only thing that are
responsible for this, but only particular individuals who have
inherited the susceptibility are at increased risk,'' said Dr. Lisa
A. Cannon-Albright, the study's principle author. ``Then other
factors, such as diet, act upon those people to transform polyps
into colo-rectal cancer.''
   In another report published with the study in the New England
Journal of Medicine, Dr. Bert Vogelstein and others from Johns
Hopkins University say that a series of four or five genetic
mutations and deletions are necessary for colon or rectal cancer to
occur. Just how the two discoveries fit together is still unclear,
but Vogelstein said they don't necessarily contradict each other.
   ``It would suggest that for some reasons, members of those
families who have colon cancer have a higher tendency to mutate one
of these genes, or they already have inherited a mutated copy,''
Vogelstein said in an interview. ``If it takes four or five steps
to get cancer, and they have already inherited one of them, that
would explain why they get cancer more frequently, because they
already have a head start.''
   The American Cancer Society recommends that people over age 50
have stool tests annually for signs of cancer, and they should have
proctosignoidoscopy _ examination of the colon with a lighted tube
_ every three to five years.
   Dr. Lowell Schnipper of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital said that
as a result of the newest findings, those exams should probably
start at age 40 in people who have relatives with colon or rectal
cancer.
   He said the new study suggests that ``there may well be people
at considerably greater risk than others. We should focus our
attention on getting relatives of colon cancer patients into the
doctor's office for screening.''
   Based on colon exams of 670 people in 34 families, the Utah team
concluded that 32 percent of all white Americans inherit one or two
copies of a dominant gene that makes them susceptible polyps. There
is a 63 percent chance that people with the gene will get polyps by
age 80.
   They did not estimate the chance that people who carry the gene
will actually get colon or rectal cancer.
   The 34 families were selected randomly from Utah families in
which colon or rectal cancer or polyps had been diagnosed.
Researchers said the sample had a disproportionate number of
Mormons, who make up roughly half the state's population, but that
the results would apply to white Americans in general.

   Vice President George Bush put his rusty college
baseball skills to the test Wednesday by trying to dump a clown
into a vat of water at the Michigan state fair.
   Out of several dozen tries, Bush succeeded just once.
   ``Put some power behind it, if you've got anything left,''
taunted Bozo, the star of a carnival booth called ``Make Bozo
Splash.''
   The object of the game: hit a small red target with a baseball
and dump Bozo into the water. Jacket off, tie loosened in the hot
sunshine, the Republican presidential nominee valiantly tried to
dunk the clown for an audience of security agents, reporters and
his young grandson, Sam LeBlond.
   ``Gotta get the red, prez,'' Bozo counseled.
   The vice president finally connected, sending the clown down
with a left-handed toss.
   Bush also played bingo _ no wins _ during his brief stroll on
the fair midway.

   Singer John Denver, who wants to ride aboard the
Soviet Mir space station, is spending three days at NASA's Johnson
Space Center undergoing a medical evaluation given to all astronaut
applicants, a spokesman says.
   Denver, 44, began the medical evaluation Tuesday, and is paying
$1,500 to $2,000 for it, a space center spokesman said.
   Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine reported recently that
Denver asked the Soviets to launch him to the Mir space station
after he failed in repeated attempts to ride on the U.S. space
shuttle.
   But Carrie Click, a spokeswoman for Denver, said the Soviet
Union has contacted numerous Americans _ from scientists to
politicians to Denver _ about having an American fly in the Soviet
space program.
   ``John did not approach them,'' she said.
   The Soviets reportedly imposed several conditions including a
$10 million pricetag and U.S. permission. Denver, however, said he
has no intention of paying $10 million and will discuss with the
Soviets alternatives for financing the trip.
   In a letter to Denver, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz
cautioned he must comply with U.S. laws but he also suggested that
NASA could assist Denver with medical information about
spaceflight, the Houston Chronicle reported.

   When the conservative watchdog group Accuracy in
Media took aim at CBS anchor Dan Rather with a tiny ad at the
bottom of the front page of The New York Times, Rather took a
little potshot back.
   AIM's advertisement, which ran Tuesday, said, ``Are you mad at
Dan Rather?'' and gave a toll-free number. Calls to that number got
a recording complaining that the recent CBS documentary ``The Wall
Within'' inaccurately suggested that Vietnam veterans are mentally
deranged.
   ``If this CBS slander of Vietnam veterans makes you mad, tell
Dan Rather how you feel,'' said the recording, then it gave
Rather's office phone number.
   But calls to Rather's line got a recording, too _ of ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.''
   ``It wasn't a real big deal,'' said CBS News spokesman Tom
Goodman. ``It was a dog days of summer, fun thing to do. Dan was
just telling these people, hey, don't question my patriotism.''
   In the documentary, Rather interviewed veterans who still suffer
from severe episodes of post-traumatic stress disorder.

   Even as Solidarity leader Lech Walesa makes
history anew this week by meeting with the Polish government, a
Hollywood production company is announcing a movie of his life.
   The life of the Nobel Prize-winning leader of the banned Polish
trade union will be dramatized in the movie ``Polonaise,'' it was
announced Tuesday.
   The film will be produced and directed by Stanley Kramer, and
the script was written by Oscar-winning screenwriter Daniel
Taradash. The script is based on meetings with Walesa in Poland,
Movie Associates Inc. said.
   Production is to begin in the fall.
   Kramer, 74, has tackled numerous films about social issues
including ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,'' ``Judgment at
Nuremberg,'' and ``Inherit the Wind.'' Other Kramer films include
``It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'' and ``The Runner Stumbles.''
   Taradash won an Academy Award for the screenplay to the 1953
film ``From Here to Eternity.''

   Singer Brenda Lee has sued MCA Records
for $20 million, claiming she has not been paid her share of
royalties during her 30-year career.
   In her Davidson County Chancery Court suit she claims MCA failed
to account for sales, licensed her records without her
authorization, neglected foreign licensing and blocked her attempts
to make audits.
   Lee refused comment Tuesday night. MCA Records also has declined
comment. The suit was filed Aug. 4.
   Lee began recording for MCA's predecessor, Decca, in 1956 when
she was 11 years old. The suit stems from a 20-year contract she
signed with Decca in 1962.
   Her hits include ``I'm Sorry,'' ``As Usual,'' ``Rockin' Around
the Christmas Tree'' and ``Sweet Nothin's.''

Public Library when hordes of fans forced them to flee out the back
door.
   ``We usually try to do this on our day off _ just pick up a few

discovered him and his brother LeRoy in the library Tuesday
afternoon.
   ``We're not taking any college classes yet, but in the meantime
we're here gathering knowledge,'' Rudy said.
   Their discovery at the library started a noisy, impromptu
autograph session until librarians put an end to the disturbance
and the brothers slipped out the back door.
   The Jets, a brother-sister group known for hits such as ``Crush

   The government threatened protesters who
have occupied government buildings, and striking public employees
planned a huge march Thursday against 26 years of authoritarian
rule.
   Organizers said four columns of demonstrators marching from
different areas would converge on Bandoola Gardens, Rangoon's
largest park, for a rally.
   Employees of more than 120 government departments and
state-owned corporations formed the All Services General Strike
Committee on Tuesday. It was the fourth illegal association created
in three days.
   Students and dock workers have formed illegal unions and 21
elder statesmen created a Committee for Democracy led by Win Maung,
72, who was president in Prime Minister U Nu's government.
   U Nu, 81, was the man ousted in the 1962 military coup that
ended Burmese democracy. He has been named ``patron'' of the group.
   Rangoon radio broadcast an official statement that said the
government has allowed peaceful assembly and marches, but added:
   ``In some towns, People's Council (local government) offices and
other government buildings are illegally occupied by the people.
Illegal occupants must vacate the People's Council offices and
government buildings immediately or face the consequences.''
   It did not describe the consequences. The statement was signed
by Maung Ko, secretary to the Council of Ministers, as the Cabinet
is called.
   President Maung Maung's government has said a special session of
the Burma Socialist Program Party, the nation's only legal
political group, will be held Sept. 12 to consider holding a
referendum on one-party rule.
   Protesters from all segments of Burmese society have rejected
that and demand formation of an interim government to bring back
democracy.
   A general strike has paralyzed Rangoon and other cities.
Protesters apparently have taken over the local adminsitrations of
Victoria Point in southernmost Mergui state and some other towns.
   Local adminstrations _ the People's Councils _ and officers of
the ruling party have resigned in some areas, with security and
other duties being taken up by residents and Buddhist monks.
   One Burmese analyst described the situation as anarchic. He said
Wednesday that people live in daily fear and suspense amid rumors
of bombings, arson, looting and impending coups.
   Turmoil began when Burmese leader Ne Win resigned July 23, after
imposing more than a quarter-century of isolation and economic ruin
after the coup. He was succeeded by Sein Lwin, a hardliner held
responsible for bloody repression of previous protests.
   Soldiers shot into crowds of demonstrators and at least 112
people were killed in Rangoon alone, according to official figures.
Unofficial estimates put the number at several times that.
   Maung Maung, a civilian lawyer, replaced Sein Lwin after 17 days
and the violence abated, but protests continued.
   Rangoon radio said more than 1,500 prisoners were released
Tuesday and Wednesday from Insein jail in Rangoon and a prison at
Mandalay in central Burma. That brings to about 8,700 the number
reported freed from the two jails.
   Riots were reported last week at those and five other jails,
where smaller numbers of prisoners have been released.
   The official radio urged striking workers to resume their jobs
at the nation's two oil refineries, at Syriam 10 miles southeast of
Rangoon and Mann in central Burma.
   ``As petrol and diesel oil cannot be refined and sold,
transportation of commodities by car and rail and commuter
transport services will no longer be possible,'' it said. ``Hence
the working people will have to bear the high cost of goods.''
   Officials accompanied by soldiers began house-to-house searches
Tuesday for engineers of the Syriam refinery to force them back to
work, but an engineer told the Associated Press on Wednesday none
had been found.
   He said he and his colleagues were in hiding and would continue
the strike until an interim government was formed. About 150
refinery engineers, technicians and chemists are on strike, he said.
   Sources said more than 5,000 employees of the Syriam refinery,
led by the plant manager, marched in the town Sunday shouting
anti-government slogans.
   Workers at Syriam, which had produced 26,000 barrels of
petroleum products a day, walked out in mid-August when student
protesters called for a nationwide general strike. Military
engineers tried unsuccessfully to operate the plant.

   The Treasury Department said Wednesday it is
scrapping a 4-month-old program that offered investors a 24-hour,
toll-free telephone number for buying U.S. Savings Bonds with a
credit card.
   Investors used the program to buy $4.5 million in bonds from its
inception on May 3 through mid-August.
   When it was announced in April, Jerrold B. Speers, executive
director of Treasury's U.S. Savings Bonds Division, predicted sales
would ``surge as people learn they can buy bonds at any time, from
any phone.''
   However, in a statement Wednesday, he said the program ``proved
not cost-effective'' and will end Sept. 30.
   Stephen Meyerhardt, a spokesman for the division, said the
per-bond costs of selling bonds by telephone were more than the
traditional methods of selling through banks and payroll deduction
plans.
   The budget for the five-month program was $800,000, he said.
   Customers may still use the toll-free line, 1-800-US-BONDS, to
listen to a recording with rate and other information on the bonds.

   A hospital and a home for runaways won big in
a shampoo giveaway by a hotel that replaced packets with plastic
bottles of the bubbly. But creativity also counted.
   Nearly 3,000 individuals or groups responded when the Fairmont
Hotel invited people to ask in an imaginative way for the 97,900
packets of shampoo, hair conditioner and bubble bath it was giving
away, said hotel spokesman John DeMers.
   Pam Farmer, of Knoxville, Tenn., won 2,000 packets with this
entry:
   ``In Tennessee it's hot as hell,
   ``We take a lot of showers;
   ``Please send shampoo and bath gel,
   ``So we can smell like flowers.''
   The Fairmont had decided to switch to plastic bottles of
toiletries as part of its spruicing-up effort in advance of the
Republican National Convention.
   In all, about 70,000 packets of bath stuff went to charities,
officials said. New Orleans Charity Hospital, the largest in
Louisiana's system of public hospitals, and Covenant House, a
French Quarter home for runaways, each received 10,000 packets.
   The hospital's letter said state budget cuts kept it from
providing soap or shampoo to even its poorest patients, said DeMers.

   At first blush, it sounds like a pretty
good deal. If you don't mow your lawn in Hempstead, the town will
do it for you.
   Ah, but there are strings attached to the new lawn law, which
was approved by town supervisors Tuesday. For starters, the town
will charge errant landowners a fee for municipal mowing. And town
officials have the right to tack on a $250 fine and throw the
offender in jail.
   The fee hasn't been determined.
   The beautification law, which goes into effect this fall,
specifies that the town will cut any lawn in which the grass is
more than 8 inches high. It also empowers the town to remove
abandoned vehicles from private property.
   Officials won't prowl through neighborhoods with tape measures,
said Presiding Supervisor Joseph Mondello. But action will be taken
against people whose neighbors complain enough, or whose lawn is
obviously high enough to be unsightly, he said.

<HEAD>Former Gang Member Battles To Play Football</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YORKVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school senior who hit ``rock
bottom'' in jail as a gang member went from the streets to student
council president but faces a legal battle to keep playing football
in hopes of winning a college scholarship.
   Robert Vaughn, 19, is a former street-gang member from Aurora
and is now a ``B'' student at Yorkville High School in this
affluent western Chicago suburb.
   His family moved in 1986 to Yorkville where Vaughn, the only
black at the school of 640, is now the student council president
and a star running back for the Fighting Foxes, gaining more than
700 yards last year.
   Vaughn is fighting an Illinois High School Association
regulation that says he is too old to play organized high school
sports.
   Attorneys for Vaughn filed a lawsuit Aug. 22 challenging the
association's refusal to grant him an exemption from the rule.
Vaughn turned 19 July 10 and the rule says he is ineligible because
his 19th birthday was before Aug. 15.
   ``If I didn't play, it would probably hurt my chances of getting
a scholarship, which would be my ticket'' to a college education,
Vaughn said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
   ``When I was in jail, I realized I was at rock bottom and the
only way I have to go is up,'' he said, adding he wants to become a
criminal lawyer.
   Vaughn spent 2{ months in the Illinois Youth Home in Valley View
in 1985 because of gang activities in Aurora.
   Kendall County Circuit Judge James Wilson issued a temporary
restraining order Tuesday that permits Vaughn to play in
Yorkville's Friday night opener, and five more of the team's nine
regular-season games.
   Wilson scheduled an Oct. 12 court date to hear further arguments
from the high school association.
   ``We think that Vaughn is a fine young man, but he is in clear
violation of the rules,'' said Wayne Plaza, an attorney
representing the association.
   Plaza said the association is disappointed with the ruling
because Vaughn is ``one person now being given an exception that no
one else is being given.''
   Yorkville officials had requested the exemption under a recently
adopted association bylaw governing hardships, saying Vaughn was
unable to play organized high school sports during what would have
been his freshman year in 1985, when he was jailed as a gang member.
   The association denied the school's request, saying its bylaw
extends only to cases where hardships occur beyond the control of
the student, family or school.
   Yorkville Principal Frank Babich said Vaughn has overcome all
obstacles so far _ including being the only black student in the
school's history _ and should be allowed to play.
   ``We felt here was a young guy who was able to redirect his life
from a negative to a positive,'' Babich said.
   Babich, who once taught at Aurora East High School, said many
students in that area get involved with gangs to gain a sense of
identity, and often steal and vandalize to get attention.
   ``When Bob came to us, the only problems we had with him were
his academics and general schooling,'' Babich said. ``He just
wasn't used to going to school.''
   Vaughn has his loftier goals, but there's another reason for his
court fight.
   ``I would like to play football, and that's about it,'' he said.

   Here is the text of President
Reagan's 1988 Labor Day message, as released by the White House on
Wednesday:
   Each Labor Day, we pause as a nation to honor some of the
greatest heroes of the American story. On this 94th Labor Day, I
ask all Americans to join me in offering heartfelt thanks and
praise to working men and women.
   We salute working people because they have built our land with
skill, energy, and resourcefulness, transforming raw materials into
a shining edifice of freedom and prosperity. On Labor Day we
recognize these achievements and reflect on the meaning and dignity
of work and on the values it protects and strengthens _ the values
we as a nation hold most dear.
   In both peacetime and time of war, American workers have always
offered each other and the world their very best, affirming their
liberty as individuals and as members of a team and promoting the
ideals of free enterprise and democracy here and around the globe.
   America's workers continue to display the spirit, ingenuity and
adaptability to new conditions that labor and employers alike need
if our economy is to continue to grow. This willingness to meet
every challenge speaks volumes about the health and vitality of our
way of life.
   Let us always remember that so much of what we are, we owe to
working men and women. God gave us this land, but under his good
graces, the labor of people has helped it flourish and pour forth
its plenty for ourselves and the world. For all these reasons,
America celebrates Labor Day, 1988, with fresh gratitude and pride.
   Ronald Reagan.

<HEAD>Afghan Foreign Minister Proposes Meeting Counterparts to Talk
Peace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union sent fighter planes to the
northern Afghanistan city of Kunduz to support government forces,
but this did not violate the Geneva peace agreement, a Kremlin
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said fighter
aircraft based on Soviet territory were dispatched to Kunduz, but
declined to provide details of the type of planes or of the
operations.
   In another development, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil
proposed meeting with his counterparts from Pakistan, the Soviet
Union and the United States for new efforts to bring peace to his
country, Tass reported.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said this week
that the Soviets had directed aircraft into Afghanistan and moved
some Red Army troops into Kunduz from elsewhere within the country.
She said this violated the Geneva accords.
   At a news briefing, Gerasimov denied this charge and another
U.S. allegation that the Kremlin had sent ground troops back to
Kunduz, about 30 miles from the Soviet border, after withdrawing
them recently.
   Gerasimov said Soviet aircraft had to be sent in to help Afghan
forces repel rebels fighting trying to overthrow Kabul's Marxist
government.
   ``When the Soviet troops left and part of the troops were still
there, counterrevolutionary, anti-governmental gangs began to
operate, so countermeasures were required,'' he said.
   Asked whether the Afghan government requested the assistance, or
whether the Soviets volunteered it, the spokesman said: ``When in
the area around Kunduz, a critical situation emerged, then with the
consent of the Afghan government, aircraft were used from Soviet
territory for rendering urgent support including a Soviet unit
fighting counter-revolutionary formations.''
   Gerasimov reinterated the Soviet complaints against Pakistan and
also lashed out at the United States.
   ``Nothing of this kind would have happened had Pakistan, with
the support of the United States, not supplied arms to the rebels,
including advisers,'' he said.
   Wakil said in a letter that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar should also participate in the talks, according to the
official news agency.
   The United Nations oversaw indirect peace talks between
Afghanistan and Pakistan that culminated in April with the signing
of an international agreement aimed at ending the 9-year-old Afghan
civil war and Soviet involvement in it.
   Wakil said the foreign ministers' meeting could be arranged with
the U.N. secretary-general's help ``as soon as possible'' to review
compliance with the Geneva agreement, Tass said. Letters proposing
the session were sent to the United Nations and the countries
invited.
   The message repeated Soviet and Afghan charges that Pakistan is
violating the agreement by interfering in Afghanistan's affairs,
and noted that 73 complaints about this have been filed with the
United Nations.
   Pakistan has rebel bases and helps funnel U.S.-supplied arms to
the insurgents.
   The Afghan government is hoping a leadership change in Pakistan
will mean more cooperation in peace efforts.
   ``We hope that the new Pakistani government, realizing the need
for an above-board approach to the international agreements signed
by the country, will take steps toward improving relations between
the two neighboring Moslem states and normalizing the situation in
the region as a whole,'' Wakil said.
   Pakistan President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, a strong backer of the
rebels, was killed in a plane crash Aug. 17. He was succeeded by
Ghulam Ishaq Khan, chairman of the Senate.
   Under the Geneva accords, the Soviets have pulled out half of
their 100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan since May 15, and the
remainder is scheduled to be withdrawn by Feb. 15.

   Here is the text of President
Reagan's message on National Hispanic Heritage Week, Sept. 11-17,
as released by the White House:
   I am pleased to send warm greetings and congratulations to the
Hispanic American community as you celebrate National Hispanic
Heritage Week, Sept. 11-17, 1988.
   One of the greatest strengths of our nation is the rich cultural
diversity of our people. Since the discovery of America, Hispanics
have been a vibrant part of that diversity. They were among the
first settlers of the New World, arriving long before the United
States achieved independence. From Florida to California, Hispanics
have left an indelible mark on our land, helping to forge one of
the greatest nations on earth. As we look forward to the turn of
the century, it is clear that Americans of Hispanic descent will
have an even greater role in achieving our national destiny. That
is the good news, because the values which Hispanics have always
cherished _ faith, love of family, and pride in country _ are the
very values that built our Nation and that will keep it strong and
free.
   During the week beginning Sept. 11, our country will celebrate
National Hispanic Heritage Week and will recognize the important
role Hispanic Americans play in our national life. Nancy and I are
very happy to join with all our fellow citizens in honoring the
achievements of Hispanic Americans, and we send you our best wishes
for every success and happiness. God bless you, and God bless
America!

   Here is the text of President
Reagan's message on the Jewish High Holy Days, which the White
House released Wednesday:
   ``With reverence, awe and joy, Jewish people around the globe
observe Rosh Hashanah, or the Day of Judgment, and Yom Kippur, the
Day of Atonement. On Rosh Hashanah, the Almighty judges the actions
of mankind, and because it is the world's birthday, he takes stock
of his creations. Yom Kippur is a time for reflection and
introspection.
   During these High Holy Days, Jews focus their prayers on their
individual deeds and the need for repentance _ and on the
well-being of their brethren and of all humanity. The liturgy of
these special days portrays the Almighty as both a stern judge and
a compassionate father. Those who observe these Holy Days seek
renewed strength and forgiveness for their shortcomings.
   The Jewish New Year is also a happy time of rebirth and
optimism, a time to look to the future with high hopes and high
expectation. This past year has seen limited but nevertheless
positive steps on the issue of human rights in the Soviet Union,
and I hope progress will continue and accelerate as the new year of
5749 unfolds.
   I will continue to press for the release of all refuseniks, for
full freedom of emigration and for basic rights of religious and
cultural expression. We cannot be satisfied with less.
   Nancy joins me in extending warm greetings to Jewish people here
and abroad, and in once again saying, L'Shahah Tova _ may you be
inscribed in the Book of Life for a good year.
   Ronald Reagan.''

   Only a handful of friends and relatives
were waiting here for passengers from Delta Air Lines Flight 1141,
and chaplains said they were dealing well with news that the
jetliner had crashed today in Texas.
   ``The mood is anxious, but it's better than it could have
been,'' said Cliff Higbee, a volunteer police chaplain and Mormon
bishop. He said there were only two relatives among those taken
into a lounge to await news.
   ``We've seen few family members here. Most of the people inside
are Delta officials,'' Higbee said. ``It's unbelievable that there
were not more people on the plane who were from Salt Lake City.''
   None of six people in the lounge lost a loved one, said another
chaplain, Kent Goble. ``Frankly, there's no one in there that's
been traumatized.''
   Higbee said one man who was picking up a business associate
learned from the man's office in Arkansas that he had survived.
woman learned four hours after the crash that her sister and
brother-in-law, too, had survived.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry in Atlanta said 13 people were killed

<HEAD>Library of Congress Gets Large Gift of Original Music Manuscripts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Library of Congress said Wednesday it has
received a major gift of several thousand documents written by
composers, musicians and literary figures dating to the 12th
century, including hand-written musical scores by Beethoven, Chopin
and Mendelssohn.
   The library said the bequest from Hans Moldenhauer, a Spokane,
Wash., pianist, teacher and musicologist who died last October, was
the greatest composite gift in the history of its music division,
whose collection already contained more than 8 million items.
   The bequest, received in July, represents the overwhelming bulk
of the Moldenhauer collection, which the library described as ``one
of the greatest archives of musical primary source materials ever
assembled.''
   The inventory of more than 400 pages lists several thousand
music manuscripts, letters and documents. The oldest apparently is
18 lines of Latin text on vellum, with musical notations, from a
12th century German prayer book.
   Among the many composers represented in the collection is a copy
in Ludwig van Beethoven's handwriting of music from Mozart's opera,
``Don Giovanni,'' probably written as studies for portions of
Beethoven's only opera, ``Fidelio.''
   Also included are handwritten scores of Frederic Chopin's
Prelude for Piano in A flat; Cesar Franck's Prelude, Choral and
Fugue for solo piano; the sextet from Giacomo Puccini's opera, ``La
Boheme;'' Felix Mendelssohn's arrangement of the unpublished
overture to ``Elijah'' for two pianos; and a major section of the
coronation scene from Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakoff's arrangement of the
Mussorgsky opera, ``Boris Godunov.''
   In the collection is a letter written by English composer George
Frederic Handel describing specifications for an organ to be built
for the restored home of his collaborator, Charles Jennens. It was
described as one of the very few Handel letters that discusses
musical matters.
   The Moldenhauer archives were established at the Library of
Congress last year with several gifts which were supplemented
earlier this year by major manuscripts of Johannes Brahms that were
acquired from Moldenhauer's widow, Mary.
   The combined collection includes many important documents from
composers Arnold Schoenberg and Anton von Webern, the library said,
including an unpublished Schoenberg composition that will be played
for the first time at the library's Coolidge Auditorium.
   The Moldenhauer Archives Foundation, established by the German
immigrant who arrived in the United States in 1938, will finance
the library's publication of an illustrated history of Western
music based primarily on the Moldenhauer collection.

<HEAD>Dukakis: Bush An Election-Year Convert On Environment; Demands
Iran-Contra Answers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis demanded anew on
Wednesday that Republican George Bush detail his role in the
Iran-Contra scandal, which he called ``one of the greatest foreign
policy mistakes in history.''
   Dukakis also attacked the Reagan-Bush environmental record a day
before Bush was to venture behind enemy lines for a Boston Harbor
tour designed to showcase Massachusetts' greatest environmental
embarrassment.
   Bush has criticized Dukakis for not moving earlier to clean up
the harbor, the nation's filthiest, but the Massachusetts governor
said he was not to blame and that Reagan's Environmental Protection
Agency had contributed to the delay in getting the project started.
   Dukakis scoffed at Bush's pledge Wednesday to combat acid rain
with a new program.
   ``Talk about an election year convert,'' Dukakis said. He noted
money cut from federal environmental cleanup programs and said,
``He wants to spend it on Star Wars,' the space defense proposal.
   The Democratic nominee, meeting with reporters before flying to
California to begin a three-day campaign trip, blasted the
administration for cutting funding for the Clean Water Act, some of
which could have been used for the harbor cleanup, and for not
acting promptly on the state's request for a waiver to federal
sewage treatment guidelines. When the waiver request was rejected,
Dukakis began the multi-billion dollar cleanup.
   ``We are doing it, no thanks to Mr. Bush or the
administration,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis campaign aides told a morning strategy briefing that
Dukakis would make questions about Bush's judgment a central theme
of his campaign.
   To that end, Dukakis used the meeting with reporters to denounce
Bush's role in the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran for the second
consecutive day.
   ``He refused to explain his role in this, one of the greatest
foreign policy mistakes in history,'' Dukakis said. ``The vice
president supported the decision ... The American people would like
to know the answer to a continuing question: Mr. Bush, you sat
through five meetings, five meetings on the subject. How can you
say now that you did not know that know that it was a straight
arms-for-hostages deal.''
   Joining Dukakis at the news conference was Maine Sen. George
Mitchell, the co-author of a new book on the Iran-Contra affair,
``Men of Zeal,'' and a member of the congressional committee that
investigated the arms deal.
   Mitchell said the hearing records and Bush's public statements
showed that the vice president endorsed the trading of weapons for
American hostages held by pro-Iranian factions.
   The Democratic senator, who later attended a separate news
conference to denounce the Reagan administration environmental
record, said it was ludicrous for Bush to come to Boston to discuss
water pollution and also attacked the vice president's statement on
acid rain.
   Mitchell, the prime sponsor of legislation to control emissions
blamed for acid rain, said the Reagan administration has
consistently opposed the measure.
   ``Where has Vice President Bush been for the past seven
years?,'' Mitchell said. ``The Reagan-Bush administration has
opposed every single effort to deal with acid rain. ... For any
American concerned with the environment, the choice in this
election is very clear.''
   Bush may not be alone on the harbor when he takes his pollution
tour Thursday. Dukakis aides and allies said they were considering
a harbor event of their own to answer the expected Bush attacks on
Dukakis' handling of the harbor project.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested one member of an
environmental group that has occupied three caves, but the group
continued its fight Wednesday to secure protection for rare
subterranean organisms.
   A 25-year-old woman occupying Tooth Cave was arrested for
trespassing Tuesday afternoon, said Travis County sheriff's
deputies. Formal charges were pending.
   Members of the group Earth First! on Monday occupied three caves
in northwestern Travis County, near the site of a planned shopping
center. Activists continued to occupy Amber and Kretschmarr caves
on Wednesday, a spokeswoman said.
   James Reddell, a University of Texas scientist who discovered
the three caves 25 years ago, said he agreed with the environmental
group that they are priceless biologically. But he called their
protest ``absurd, counterproductive'' and said it could threaten
the very organisms the activists are trying to save.
   ``Those caves are small, and any time you have someone inside
you change the temperature,'' he said. The protesters ``have gone
completely overboard,'' he said.
   But Earth First! coordinator Barbara Dugelby defended the
protest and said it came after months of effort to work through
normal channels.
   ``People say we're intruding on these caves,'' she said. ``We
think construction and destruction are intruding on these caves.''
   The group claimed the landowner, Dr. Fred Purcell, risked damage
to the caves by allowing sewer lines, detention ponds and roadways
to be built on the land.
   However, Purcell denied the charges, saying he is working with
city officials and researchers to keep the caves intact.
   Tooth Cave has five species of invertebrates found nowhere else
on Earth, said Reddell, who has written about 100 articles on cave
environments. But he said Purcell has been ``totally cooperative''
with explorers and with University of Texas researchers.
   Dugelby said the environmentalists want the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service to place the five species _ two beetles, a spider,
a pseudoscorpion and a ``cave-adapted daddy longlegs'' _ on its
list of endangered species.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Isaac Fogel advertised his house on the Potomac
River as having a ``river view,'' but the federal government
contends he got the view by chopping down trees in a national park.
   Fogel was indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly
destroying timber in Potomac in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
National Historical Park. The two-count indictment, handed down
Tuesday, charges that 138 trees valued at more than $30,000 were
cut down.
   ``We will not stand idly by while homeowners bordering on
federal parks take it upon themselves to improve their view or
otherwise enhance the value of their property by destroying park
land,'' said Breckinridge L. Willcox, the U.S. attorney for
Maryland.
   Fogel faces a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison and a
$350,000 fine. He also could be ordered to make restitution by
planting trees in the affected area.
   Destruction of government timber is a minor misdemeanor, but the
second count, disposing of government property, is a felony.
   Fogel and his wife put the house and four acres up for sale
several years ago, advertising it as having a ``river view,'' the
indictment said. It never sold, according to Fogel's attorney,
Joshua R. Treem.
   The indictment says the trees were cut in 1985 and Treem accused
the government of ``sitting on its hands,'' in not acting before
now. He said it ``seemed a little disingenuous'' for Willcox to say
prosecutors ``won't `stand idly by' when the alleged events
happened 3{ years ago.''
   David P. King, an assistant U.S. attorney, said his office
received the case several months ago and proceeded
``expeditiously.''

   Michael Dukakis plans to portray the selection of
embattled Republican running mate Dan Quayle as an example of
George Bush's lack of judgment and leadership, a theme that will
play a major role in Democratic strategy for the fall campaign, the
Dukakis campaign said Wednesday.
   ``We start this campaign on a solid footing in a close
competitive race,'' Susan Estrich, Dukakis campaign manager, said
at a briefing on strategy for the final two months of the White
House race.
   She said Dukakis would continue stressing two themes: his goal
of extending economic prosperity to all Americans and the need for
leadership at the top.
   Reflecting a tougher tone from Dukakis in recent days, Estrich
said, ``We will be aggressive, but we will be aggressive on the
issues.''
   Estrich said the campaign would ``contrast the record of
accomplishment of our ticket of Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen with
the record of accomplishment or lack thereof, the record of lack of
leadership on the Republican side.''
   ``One issue we are certain to hear more of from Democrats across
the board is the selection of Sen. Quayle and his record and
qualifications,'' she said.
   Estrich predicted that ``Dan Quayle is going to emerge not only
as an issue but a liability because it goes to judgment and it goes
to leadership.''
   Campaigning in Louisiana, Quayle retorted, ``This is the first
real sign that you are seeing a crumbling campaign. I've been in
politics a long time. Fair play. Fair enough. I can stand the heat
and I'll stay in the kitchen.''
   She said the Democratic presidential campaign has paid staff in
every state and is getting strong assistance from state parties as
well. She cited the crucial states of California with 75 Democratic
Party field organizers and Texas with 50, as examples.
   ``We believe we go into the Labor Day beginning with one of the
best organized campaigns that a Democrat has been able to mount,''
she said.
   Dukakis and Bentsen will appear together at a traditional Labor
Day rally in Detroit and then go their separate campaign ways.
   The Dukakis campaign and the Democratic National Committee are
preparing separate advertising campaigns to air Labor Day week.
   The party's advertising campaign will highlight the theme
``bringing prosperity home,'' while the initial campaign aids will
focus on Dukakis' record as governor of Massachusetts, portraying
him as a skilled administrator capable of implementing the goals
his goals of an improved economy and better jobs, she said.
   ``It's our sense right now that voters have only scant
information of what Dukakis has accomplished,'' she said.
   `There is a lot of misinformation out there and we're going to
correct it,'' said Estrich, an indirect acknowledgment that
Republican nominee Bush has scored well in recent weeks with
attacks on Dukakis on such issues as military buildup, crime and
the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Estrich also sought to counter the Republican characterization
of the Democrats as the party of ``gloom and doom.''
   She said Dukakis' emphasis on the economy ``reflects the concern
of middle class Americans that what you have in this country is not
gloom and doom, but it is two people, both working, in millions of
families to make what one person made 20 years ago.''
   She brushed aside concerns that Dukakis has spent an unusual
amount of time the past two weeks campaigning in his home state.
   ``It's not an issue,'' she said. ``It's a responsibility that
comes with being governor. ... With those responsibilities come a
real record of accomplishment and experience.''
   Asked to cite specific differences between Bentsen and Quayle,
Estrich said, ``Mike Dukakis chose as his vice president the man
who led the fight for plant closing legislation. George Bush chose
as his vice president the man who led the fight against it.''
   She referred to a billthat would require companies to give
advance notice to workers and communities before shutting down
plants.
   Bush has said he would place his vice president in charge of
coordinating an administration war against drugs, but Estrich noted
that in a recent interview, the Indiana senator admitted he did not
know that Bush headed an administration task force to block the
flow of drugs into Florida.
   ``Believe me, when I get into it, I will know a lot about that
program,'' Quayle told the Boston Globe in an interview published
Monday.

<HEAD>U.S. Urges Soviets to Stop Cross-Border Bombing Of Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Wednesday urged the
Soviet Union to stop sending planes from its territory to strike at
U.S.-backed guerrillas in Afghanistan.
   The call came on the eve of a meeting in Moscow between
Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost and Soviet Deputy Foreign
Minister Yuli Vorontsov.
   The two diplomats are meeting to discuss a series of regional
issues affecting the superpowers' client states around the world,
but the Afghanistan question is expected to be at the top of the
agenda.
   On Tuesday, the State Department accused the Soviet Union of
violating the Geneva accords for the pullout of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan by sending its planes to bomb the Mujahedeen rebels
around the northern Afghan city of Kunduz.
   A government spokesman in Moscow confirmed that Soviet-based
fighter aircraft were used to aid Afghan ground troops battling for
Kunduz but denied the action violated the Geneva accords. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov also denied another U.S.
allegation that the Kremlin had sent troops back to Kunduz, about
30 miles (50 kms) from the Soviet border, after recently
withdrawing them.
   But Mrs. Oakley dismissed Gerasimov's denial, saying, ``I'm
sticking where I was on this question yesterday. We said that these
raids came from bases inside the Soviet Union. Therefore, in our
view, it was a violation.''
   She cited a clause in the Geneva accords which she said commits
the Soviets to ``refrain from any form of interference or
intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.''
   Mrs. Oakley declined to elaborate, saying only, ``obviously the
Soviets have admitted that they have used aircraft in the bombing
raids in Kunduz from areas inside Afghanistan. Let me repeat, we
wish they'd stop it.''
   Mrs. Oakley reiterated that the United States was in the process
of preparing a complaint for the U.N. Good Offices Mission which
monitors the Geneva pact. The agreement signed last April calls for
the pullout of all Soviet troops by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets have already complied with an Aug. 15 deadline for
withdrawing half of their estimated 115,000 troops following more
than eight years of occupation.
   The Soviets have repeatedly complained to the U.N. about U.S.
and Pakistani violations of the pact in connection with supplies to
the Mujahedeen.
   The United States says it will keep arming the rebels as long as
the Soviets supply the Kabul government.

<TEXT>
   The state's top court refused Wednesday to
consider removing former Rep. Mario Biaggi from the state's
Democratic primary ballot, despite his resignation and conviction
on corruption charges.
   The decision by the Court of Appeals not to hear the appeal by
Biaggi's primary opponents means the popular Bronx Democrat's name
will almost certainly be on the ballot Sept. 15 even though he has
said he's not a candidate.
   Biaggi, 70, was in his 10th term when he resigned his
congressional seat Aug. 5, the day after he was convicted on
federal racketeering, extortion and bribe-taking charges in
connection with the Wedtech defense scandal.
   Because of Biaggi's popularity, some Bronx Democratic leaders
believe there's a strong chance he could win the primary election.
In the heavily Democratic district, a primary victory often
guarantees a November election victory, and that's especially true
in this case because Biaggi also has the Republican nomination.
   If Biaggi is re-elected to Congress, it's expected that he would
resign again rather than face the possibility of not being seated
by his former colleagues. The House had been poised to begin
expulsion hearings against him when he resigned in August.
   In the wake of Wednesday's action, the only way Biaggi could get
off the Sept. 15 Democratic primary ballot is by death, being
nominated for a judgeship or moving out of the state.
   Biaggi's opponents in the Sept. 15 Democratic primary, state
Assemblyman Eliot Engel and former Assemblyman Vincent Marchiselli,
had tried to get the state Board of Elections and the state courts
to have Biaggi's original nominating petitions declared invalid.
The two have been rebuffed, even though Biaggi says he doesn't want
to run.
   Arnold Linhardt, a spokesman for Engle, said there probably were
no grounds for bringing the appeal to the federal courts.
   Should Biaggi be re-elected and resign again, it would be up to
Gov. Mario Cuomo to call a special election, probably in February
at the earliest.
   Linhardt said some Bronx Democratic leaders want Biaggi to be
re-elected so they can handpick a candidate for the special
election. Neither Engel nor Marchiselli are considered organization
favorites.
   Biaggi faces up to 20 years in prison on the counts for which he
was convicted Aug. 4. He has said he would appeal. Biaggi also has
been sentenced to 30 months in prison for obstructing justice and
taking a free Florida trip in an unrelated case involving alleged
favors for a Brooklyn shipyard company.

<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department and a handful of
Republican congressmen are challenging a State Department
recommendation that export licenses be granted for China to launch
U.S.-made satellites, administration and congressional sources said
Tuesday.
   The White House national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin
Powell, told members of the House in a letter that President Reagan
will reach a decision on the issue by mid-September.
   Transportation Department officials argued at an interagency
meeting last Thursday that allowing China to launch the satellites
aboard its Long March booster would undercut U.S. companies that
are trying to develop an Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV).
   The Reagan administration has barred private U.S. companies from
launching satellites aboard the Soviet Proton booster. And Congress
and the administration have encouraged U.S. firms to develop a
one-time booster in the wake of the Challenger shuttle disaster.
   The Transportation Department ``has expressed a concern that the
approval of this export license could be to the detriment of the
emerging commercial space launch industry that the president is
trying to create,'' said a department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., said in a letter to the White House
that: ``Permitting U.S. satellites to be launched on either the
Proton rocket of the Soviet Union or the Long March vehicle of the
Peoples' Republic of China _ both of which are government produced
and backed ... would defeat the intent of presidential and
congressional policy.''
   ``The artificially low prices offered by these countries are
less than half of the cost to U.S. firms to build similar
vehicles,'' Solomon wrote.
   Solomon's letter to the White House was signed by five other
Republican congressmen, Jack Kemp of New York, William Broomfield
of Michigan, Robert Walker of Pennsylvania, Jerry Lewis of Calif.,
and James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.
   Powell replied that the administration was judging applications
to export satellites for launch by China ``on a case-by-case
basis.''
   The State Department favors allowing U.S.-made satellites to go
up on the Long March so as not to offend the Chinese, say
administration sources.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told reporters that
``because the issue is under review, it is inappropriate for me to
comment at this point.'' Other State Department officials said the
issue would be decided by the White House.
   The six Republican House members argued that giving business to
China's government-owned and government-subsidized Long March
booster program would:
   _Jeopardize the jobs of 8,000 Americans involved in developing a
U.S. booster.
   _``Act to the detriment of our goal of assured access to space''
and undercut U.S. efforts to develop a ``reserve fleet'' of launch
vehicles ``in time of national emergency.''
   _``Result in a one-way street of transferring sophisticated U.S.
aerospace technology to the Peoples' Republic of China.''
   Two organizations, both foreign, have applied for licenses to
export U.S.-made satellites to China. Aussat, an Austrialian
company, signed a letter of intent in June with the Hughes Aircraft
Co. to manufacture two telecommunications satellites.
   Asiasat, owned by British and Hong Kong concerns, is negotiating
with Hughes to refurbish a Westar 6 satellite that was launched by
the U.S. shuttle in 1984, failed to reached the proper orbit, and
was recovered by the shuttle, said Hughes spokesman Don O'Neill.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa Wednesday
night appealed to striking workers across the country to settle
local grievances with management in order to end Poland's worst
wave of strikes in seven years.
   Walesa said the national issues of guaranteeing trade union
pluralism and legalizing his banned trade union Solidarity would be
taken up in round-table discussions promised by the government in
the near future, according to a statement read by an aide.
   The aide, Piotr Konopka, said Walesa was conferring with
strikers at the Lenin shipyard and the strike there could end very
soon.
   Walesa's statement came after meeting with Communist officials
for the first time since the union was banned in 1982. The
officials media said they discussed holding talks on workers'
grievances.
   The extraordinary, three-hour meeting was aimed at solving
Poland's strongest wave of strikes since the 1981 martial law
crackdown.
   ``I am an optimist,'' a smiling Walesa told reporters and
several dozen cheering supporters after the meeting.
   Walesa had no other comment as he left the Roman Catholic
episcopate in Warsaw by car. He conferred with top Solidarity
advisers and church officials for two hours after concluding his
talks with Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak.
   Earlier, a communique by the press office of the episcopate said
that Walesa had raised the key issues of Solidarity's future and
union pluralism.
   ``The partners (in the talks) stated that all problems connected
with union movement will be discussed at the round table. There are
no taboo subjects,'' the communique said.
   Ten enterprises across the country remained idled by strikers
demanding reinstatement of Solidarity and higher wages to offset 60
percent inflation.
   The state-run news agency PAP carried a brief report on the
talks.
   ``Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak met with Lech Walesa in Warsaw. The talk
was attended by Bishop Jerzy Dabrowski and Stanislaw Ciosek,'' the
PAP report said. Ciosek is a secretary of the official national
unity organization PRON. PRON, which stands for Patriotic Movement
for National Rebirth, was set up by the government shortly after
martial law.
   Witnesses who saw Walesa leave the meeting said it was held in a
villa in the Mokotow district of Warsaw 300 feet from the residence
of the U.S. Ambassador to Poland.
   Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, then returned to
the Roman Catholic episcopate, where he went after arriving from
Gdansk.
   PAP said the participants discussed ``the premises for holding a
round-table meeting and its procedures.''
   The PAP report apparently referred to Friday's proposal by
Kiszczak for broad-based ``round-table'' discussions on worker
grievances.
   The Communist Party's ruling Politburo on Tuesday heard a report
on ``preparations for the `round-table' meeting,'' and recommended
Kiszczak continue ``the mission entrusted to him.''
   Lt. Colonel Wieslaw Gornicki, an aide to Polish leader Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, told ABC's Good Morning America today that
Kiszczak talked to Walesa as an ``eminent personality,'' but not as
``the chairman of a nonexistent union.''
   The government demanded in exchange for the talks that Walesa
end a strike at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk.
   When asked by reporters earlier today if he would do this,
Walesa replied, ``I don't have the powers.'' When asked if that
meant he would not call off the strike, the Solidarity chairman
said, ``I did not say so.''
   Asked what he would discuss with Kiszczak, Walesa said: ``How to
make up for the past seven years.''
   Accords signed at the Gdansk shipyard on Aug. 31, 1980 after a
nationwide strike wave made Solidarity the only independent labor
federation ever recognized in the Soviet bloc. It was suppressed
with martial law in 1981 and banned the next year.
   The current strikes began began Aug. 16 in the coal fields of
Silesia, in southern Poland, and spread to Solidarity's traditional
stronghold in the ports and shipyards of the Baltic coast.
   At their peak, they affected 20 businesses employing about
100,000 people.
   A strike at the huge steel and heavy machinery plant in Stalowa
Wola, in southeastern Poland, intensified this week.
   Senior Solidarity advisers called today's Warsaw meeting a
historic event.
   Walesa last met with a senior government official in early 1982,
when he was still interned.
   In recent years, he has been spoken of by the government as a
private citizen, a tool of foreign powers and ``the former head of
a former union.''
   But in the past few months, authorities have been seeking
partners in an attempt to open a dialogue with society that might
help lead the country out of economic despondency.
   ``The results of this meeting ... will be very important for the
fate of the whole country and the world,'' said Adam Michnik, a
senior Solidarity adviser.
   At a news conference in Warsaw, Urban, the government spokesman,
said ``the starting of talks would be a common victory.''
   The evening news Tuesday showed footage of the signing of the
Gdansk agreements on Aug. 31, 1980 by Walesa and Mieczyslaw
Jagielski, who at that time was the deputy prime minister.
   ``It's high time to try it again,'' said the television news
moderator at the conclusion of the report.

<HEAD>De La Madrid To Make Final Report On Administration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Miguel de la Madrid believes his
biggest accomplishment is maintaining social order while keeping
the country from going bankrupt, an aide said.
   De la Madrid, who planned to deliver his final state of the
nation message on Thursday, came to power on Dec. 1, 1982. Mexico
was nearly bankrupt after a collapse in oil prices, inflation was
rampant and the value of the peso was plunging.
   While he is proud of keeping Mexico solvent and relatively free
of unrest, ``his frustration was not being able to do the things he
would have liked because of the economic limitations,'' said the
aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity Tuesday.
   But de la Madrid's efforts to reform a corrupt political system
produced Mexico's most democratic election since his Institutional
Revolutionary Party gained power in 1929.
   One hundred seats to be divided in proportion to the national
vote were added to the lower house of the legislature, giving the
opposition an opportunity to win a larger role. Opposition
candidates were permitted to win local elections, especially in the
north.
   The PRI itself instituted primaries on the municipal level,
although a disagreement about presidential primaries was one factor
in a split that helped the left-wing opposition, which grouped
itself as the Democratic Front.
   The result was a July 6 presidential election that saw the
opposition win nearly 50 per cent of the popular vote and a
forceful voice in Congress. But the opposition contended the PRI
maintained its grip on power only through massive fraud.
   A long wrangle in the Chamber of Deputies ended with the PRI
taking 260 seats and a divided opposition 240 _ 139 for the leftist
Front and 101 for the rightist National Action Party. The left also
won four of 64 seats in the Senate, the first time the PRI has ever
lost Senate seats.
   De la Madrid, a Harvard-trained economist, renegotiated a
foreign debt that now stands at $104 billion while resisting
pressure for a moratorium on payments. His administration took
steps to reduce the role of the state in the economy, although many
large industries, such as petroleum and banking, remain
nationalized.
   Some of the steps were painful, and the peso plunge cost Mexican
consumers about 50 percent of their buying power during de la
Madrid's six-year term.
   He also had to deal with the September 1985 earthquake in Mexico
City, which killed about 9,500 people.
   De la Madrid downplayed Mexico's high profile role in Central
America, avoiding open friction with the United States over
conflicts in Nicaragua and El Salvador while working for regional
solutions.
   He had a good working relationship with President Reagan and
argued that Mexico could not be solely responsible for stopping
drug trafficking. De la Madrid said the drug problem starts at the
consumer level in the United States.
   De la Madrid prepared the way economically for his chosen
successor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who was largely responsible
for the regime's economic measures as de la Madrid's Planning and
Budget secretary.
   In addition to loosening tight state control of the economy, de
la Madrid brought Mexico into the General Agreement in Trade and
Tariffs to force Mexican industralists to compete abroad and
domestically.
   When inflation hit nearly 150 percent in 1987, de la Madrid
united government and private business in a belt-tightening
economic solidarity pact that helped reduce inflation to 43 per
cent in the first six months of 1988. Government figures for August
show a rate of below 1 percent.
   De la Madrid suffered harsh criticism from both left and right.
Leftist presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas called for a
moratorium on debt payments, saying that they are hobbling economic
development. The National Action Party wants economic privatization
to go farther, faster.
   The political reforms changed the political structure of this
country and shook the PRI. Salinas, who won with the lowest
percentage ever for a PRI presidential candidate, said after the
election that ``the era of the one-party rule is over.''
   Referring to the drop in popular support, de la Madrid told a
group of labor leaders Tuesday that the party made mistakes.
   But he added, ``There is no threat to the system. We will
regroup, will will fight more strongly. We are strongly enough to
keep reactionaries from the left or the right to take power away
from the Mexican Revolution.''

<HEAD>Hundreds Protest US Navy Ships Capable Of Launching Nuclear
Missiles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YOKOSUKA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of protesters shouted from
hilltops and waved banners on boats Wednesday when two U.S.
warships that can launch nuclear missiles sailed into the home port
of the U.S. 7th Fleet.
   The ships are the first to be stationed in Japan with launchers
for Tomahawk missiles, which are made in both nuclear and
non-nuclear versions.
   ``Get out from Yokosuka!'' about 100 people shouted in English
at the gates of the naval base as the Ticonderoga-class guided
missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill and the destroyer USS Fife arrived
in the port 28 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   A coast guard official said the warships arrived without
incident. Forty-two coast guard patrol boats escorted the U.S.
ships into the port to prevent the approach of 28 small boats
carrying protesters and banners reading ``No Tomahawks,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Japan forbids the production, possession, or introduction into
the country of nuclear weapons.
   Nearly 200,000 people died in the Japanese cities of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki when the United States dropped the first atomic bombs
to end World War II.
   After the ships arrived, more protesters from civic and peace
groups, labor unions and the Japanese Communist Party staged
separate rallies at a park overlooking the port, outside the naval
base and elsewhere, carrying placards and shouting slogans. Police
reported no arrests.
   Protesters said the biggest rally, sponsored by the communists,
drew an estimated 1,000 people.
   On Tuesday, Yokosuka's 48-member city assembly unanimously
passed a resolution urging the government to keep out the U.S.
warships. The city's mayor and the prefectural governor also lodged
official protests Monday with the Japanese government and said it
did not do enough to ensure that the ships were not carrying
nuclear weapons.
   ``We hope our grassroot struggles will spread to a national
movement,'' said Yoshiko Saito, a leader of a citizens' group
staging a sit-in near the Yokosuka city hall.
   The 9,600-ton Bunker Hill and the 7,810-ton Fife both are
capable of deploying Tomahawk missiles. Under the Japan-U.S.
security agreement, the United States has pledged to notify Japan
beforehand if it plans to bring nuclear arms into the country.
   But critics charge the Japanese government uses the agreement as
a way of avoiding the question of whether U.S. ships dock in the
country with nuclear weapons aboard.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told reporters Wednesday that
the government would not ask the United States to confirm whether
the ships were carrying nuclear missiles because ``we trust each
other in such matters,'' Kyodo News Service reported.
   The U.S. military, which has about 50,000 personnel stationed in
Japan, maintains a policy of not publicly confirming or denying
nuclear weapons aboard its ships.

   Police captured two heavily armed
IRA guerrilla suspects heading toward a British army barracks after
driving from the Netherlands through a remote border crossing,
officials said Wednesday.
   Their car, seized around midnight Tuesday, contained two rifles
and two pistols, said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the chief
federal prosecutor's office. But he could not confirm a radio
report that the men brought explosives.
   Since March 1987, attacks by suspected Irish Republican Army
guerrillas against British army installations in West Germany have
killed three people and injured 40.
   In the latest such attack, a bomb exploded at a British army
barracks in Duesseldorf on Aug. 5. Five people were injured.
   The attacks are part of an escalated IRA campaign against
British targets in Europe.
   On Wednesday, officials said the two men drove over the Dutch
border into northwestern West Germany by using a remote country
lane that is off limits to traffic between the two countries.
   German police arrested the two suspected guerrillas after they
reached the town of Waldfeucht, 45 miles northwest of Cologne on
the Dutch border, Prechtel said.
   ``There are grounds to believe that they belong to the IRA,'' he
said in a telephone interview. ``An investigation is now underway.''
   Prechtel said the pair was headed toward a small British army
barracks in the same community, but did not specify how close they
came to the military outpost.
   Police became suspicious after spotting the pair near the remote
crossing, which has come under closer watch after IRA attacks in
the area, the spokesman said.
   ``One of them has a British passport, although we do not know
yet if it is genuine,'' Prechtel said. Police have not found any
documents for the other man, he said. Prechtel refused to release
the mens' names.
   Suedwestfunk Radio in Stuttgart reported earlier Wednesday that
the suspects were carrying weapons and explosives in their car.
   So far this year, the IRA has killed 27 members of the British
security forces in gun and bomb attacks in Northern Ireland,
elsewhere in Britain and in continental Europe.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
the predominantly Protestant province of Northern Ireland and to
unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   Passengers aboard planes sitting on the
runway watched Delta Flight 1141 scrape the runway and cheered for
the pilot to coax the floundering jet into the air.
   The Boeing 727 lifting crashed Wednesday morning just beyond the
runway at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   ``A lot of people on the left side of our plane were saying `Get
up! Get up!' when they saw it coming in front of us,'' said Rick
Arnett, an attorney from Austin.
   ``As the plane came up to take off, it was barely getting off
the ground and the right wing was dipping as it passed beyond us.
There were flames coming out of the right engine and the wing
touched the ground. The plane started spinning (and) there was an
explosion,'' said Arnett, whose flight had just landed.
   Gene Metzig was aboard a commuter flight that had just landed
from his hometown of Wichita Falls.
   ``His right wing was coming straight at us. It was probably no
more than a foot or 18 inches off the ground,'' Metzig said. ``As
he pulled it back to the left, I don't know how the hell he missed
us, but he missed us.''
   As passengers on Metzig's plane watched the Delta flight
struggling to get off the ground, they began to cheer. ``It was
like a football game,'' Metzig said. ``We were cheering this guy to
get that plane off the ground. It was very emotional. Plus, we were
in danger of our own lives. We were rooting for that pilot to get
that plane up. But there was just no way,'' he said.
   A motorist driving along the interstate said he saw the aircraft
burst into flames.
   ``I was coming over the bridge on I-30 in Arlington, and I saw a
big ball of fire going into the air,'' Greg Isaacs of Dallas told
KRLD radio. ``I started driving over there and it looked like it
was over near D-FW, and I thought, `No way could it be an airplane
accident.'''
   ``I could tell it was over near D-FW. It was an unbelievably big
explosion. I could not believe it _ I absolutely could not believe
it was that big an explosion,'' Isaacs said.
   David Hooker, 28, of Celina, was waiting at a gas station at the
south end of the airport when the plane crashed.
   ``I heard the normal noise of an airplane taking off. I turned
to watch and just barely saw the nose clear a building over
there,'' he said pointing to a low-level warehouse-type building
about a half-mile away.
   ``Then there was a cloud of smoke about three stories high and
an explosion,'' Hooker said.

<HEAD>Blast Rocks Anti-Apartheid Office Building, Injuring 23</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   A pre-dawn bombing Wednesday
rocked a six-story building housing a church organization and
leading anti-apartheid groups, injuring 23 people, police said.
   Investigators said they had no information on the type of
explosive that struck Khotso House or the identity of the bombers.
The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said without
citing sources that the bomb ``was believed to be the biggest of
its kind'' in South Africa.
   ``There has been a sinister silence surrounding the solution to
these attacks (on anti-apartheid groups),'' said Rev. Frank
Chikane, general secretary of the South African Council of
Churches, main occupant of the Khotso building.
   ``When community buildings and (anti-apartheid) organizations
are attacked no one is found (responsible) in almost all the
instances,'' said Chikane, whose organization includes most of the
country's largest Protestant denominations.
   Chikane also expressed concern the council's files might be
searched by police investigating the blast.
   Authorities declared the building unsafe and police barred
journalists and the people who work in Khotso House from entering.
   However, an SABC television crew was allowed inside and the
organization broadcast extensive footage on the evening newscast.
   Khotso House _ which means ``House of Peace'' in the Zulu
language _ serves as headquarters for the council of churches and
the Black Sash civil rights group, two of the most prominent
anti-apartheid organizations not yet affected by government bans.
   Several other church and human rights groups have offices in the
building, and it housed offices of the United Democratic Front
before the nationwide coalition and 17 other groups were banned in
February.
   The church council has taken a lead role in the anti-apartheid
movement since the bannings.
   The 1 a.m. explosion in the basement of the building slightly
injured a night watchman, passers-by, and residents of nearby
apartment buildings.
   The floor of the main lobby collapsed into the basement. Cars
parked in the building's underground garage were destroyed and
adjacent buildings were heavily damaged.
   Last year, there were several unsolved bombings and arson
attacks on offices of anti-apartheid groups and militant black
labor unions. Activists suggested these attacks were carried out by
right-wing vigilantes, either within or outside the security forces.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, whose offices were
severely damaged last year, described Wednesday's bombing as part
of a ``continuous campaign against the opponents of apartheid.''
   The congress, the nation's main black labor federation, said it
had heard nothing from police about investigations of the 1987
blast at its headquarters.
   This year, there have been a series of bombings of restaurants
and other civilian targets that authorities have blamed on the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, which seeks
to topple the white-dominated government.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok expressed condolences to the
23 people injured Wednesday and said police were conducting a
``comprehensive investigation.'' He said officers were hampered by
the fact that the building had been declared unsafe.

<TEXT>
   The city police chief says two men
should be prosecuted for appearing on a radio talk show to tell how
they saw guards kick a handcuffed prisoner at the local jail.
   Chief Joe Gerwens had warned WNWS-AM and the men that their
comments violated a state law forbidding disclosure of an official
complaint against a police officer. The show was broadcast anyway
last week, and Gerwens said Tuesday he would ask the police legal
adviser whether the two could be charged.
   Jeff Hochman, the legal adviser, said Wednesday he had talked
briefly to Gerwens but hadn't decided what steps to take.
   ``It's so blatantly a prior restraint on the press,'' said radio
host Al Rantel. ``I never knew it was against the law for people to
describe what they've witnessed.''
   Charles Bado, one of the two guests, said he decided to speak
with Rantel and newspaper reporters because he believes the law is
wrong.
   ``Under this law, you're denied the right to talk about what you
saw before you say it,'' he said.
   Gerwens, however, defended the law, saying discussing
allegations against police in the media ``could impede a successful
and thorough investigation.'' Bado, a marketing vice president for
a financial company, said he and his friend Randy Detrick were
bicycling Aug. 23 when they stopped to watch police arrest a woman
for disorderly conduct.
   Police reports say officers warned the two men to move on. Bado
said that when they did not move quickly enough, they were arrested.
   In a jail holding cell that night, Bado said he saw an inmate,
Lorenzo Pierce, 40, kicked repeatedly by guards as he lay helpless
on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back. Police say
Pierce struck two guards and spit on them, and they struggled to
get him under control.
   Bado said he also saw a guard partially disrobe another inmate
as other guards hooted at him.
   After Bado was freed, he called the police department's internal
affairs department and made an appointment to discuss the matter.
   Gerwens said that call officially started the investigation, and
under the 1982 law, Bado and Detrick were therefore prohibited from
talking about it. Violation of the law is a first-degree
misdemeanor.

<HEAD>Afghan, Two Soviets Join Cosmonauts In Space Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Afghan cosmonaut who has flown combat missions
against rebels in his country arrived with two Soviets at a manned
space station Wednesday and appealed for peace in his homeland.
   State-run television transmitted live as the Afghan cosmonaut
and his two Soviet colleagues entered the space station and met
with the two cosmonauts already on board.
   Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov already have spent eight months
in space and hope to break the 326-day space endurance record in
December. That record was set by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko,
who returned to Earth on Dec. 29.
   Afghan Abdul Ahad Mohmand, in a message addressed to his
countrymen from the Soviet space station Mir, which means
``peace,'' said violence could not be seen from outer space.
   ``I would like to believe that such will be the situation on the
land inhabited by my brothers and sisters, on the land of our
fathers and mothers who have suffered so much during the years of
the war,'' he said during the live transmission by state-run Soviet
television.
   Mohmand's presence on the flight represents an effort by the
Kremlin to boost the prestige of Afghanistan's pro-Soviet
government as Soviet troops withdraw. The Soviets have agreed to
withdraw all soldiers, who were sent to bolster that government, by
Feb. 15, 1989.
   Mohmand, 29, has flown combat missions against the
anti-government rebels in Afghanistan as a pilot in its air force.
   The three additional cosmonauts traveled into space aboard their
Soyuz TM-6 capsule, which blasted off Monday from the Baikonur
space center in Soviet Central Asia.
   It docked with the Mir space station 9:41 a.m. Moscow time (1:41
a.m. EDT).
   ``The cosmonauts feel well,'' the official Soviet news agency
Tass said.
   The five cosmonauts, wearing navy blue flight suits, were shown
by state television hugging, shaking hands and smiling aboard Mir.
One of them demonstrated an unusual position weightlessness makes
possible by standing horizontally.
   State-run television showed Mohmand reading portions of the
Koran, the holy book of Islam, on the space station Wednesday.
   ``This is the first prayer to be made in Mir,'' Tass reported.
The Soviet Union is an officially atheist nation.
   The Afghan was accompanied by Soviets Vladimir Lyakhov and Dr.
Valery Polyakov, who will stay aboard Mir to monitor the health of
Titov and Manarov as they try to break the endurance record.
   The efforts are a step toward determining whether a manned
flight to Mars, which will taken an estimated three years, is
feasible.
   Titov, 40, and Manarov, 37, have been in space since Dec. 21.
Their last visitors were a Soviet-Bulgarian crew that came aboard
in June.
   Mohmand and Lyakhov are to return to Earth on Tuesday.
   Two dozens experiments are planned during the visit of the joint
Soviet-Afghan Soyuz crew. Mohmand is to take part in experiments to
identify oil, gas and other mineral deposits in Afghanistan and
predict runoff of snow and ice in efforts to alleviate water
shortages.
   Polyakov underwent an operation before the flight to remove bone
marrow. When he returns to Earth, more marrow will be removed and
the samples compared.
   Scientists are trying to determine how to counter bone marrow
depletion, which results from prolonged space flight. Polyakov also
will study motion sickness.

   A smoker became outraged and shoved a flight
attendant across an aisle when he was told he couldn't light up, a
prosecutor said, but a defense attorney argued that the man didn't
touch any airline employee.
   James Tabacca, 34, a mortician, was on board a Trans World
Airlines flight from Boston to Los Angeles in December when it was
announced shortly before take-off that smoking would be banned on
the flight.
   But Tabacca insisted on lighting up and twisted a flight
attendant's arm and shoved her when she tried to stop him,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Robin Scroggie said Tuesday in his opening
statement in federal court here.
   Scroggie, who also alleged that Tabacca hurled obscenities at
flight service manager Pamela Martinez, said that as Tabacca was
leaving the plane, he ``intentionally rammed his shoulder into
her'' and ``swung his garment bag directly into Pam Martinez's
leg.''
   But Tabacca's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Marilyn Butler,
said Tabacca didn't touch Ms. Martinez.
   ``Nothing happened. All the people surrounding Mr. Tabacca who
could be found saw nothing,'' Ms. Butler said.
   Although Tabacca's ticket was for the smoking section, federal
regulations require airlines to provide no-smoking seats for all
passengers who arrive on time and want them. Prosecutors say this
meant most seats on the flight needed to be converted.
   The defense attorney claims Tabacca was unfairly singled out by
authorities who named him and one other smoker in an indictment.
While she says Tabacca did light a cigarette, she denies her client
touched Ms. Martinez.
   Tabacca, if convicted, faces a 20-year prison sentence and a
possible $250,000 fine, Scroggie said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court has ordered a town house owner in one of
Boston's most elegant neighborhoods to lop off a fifth-story
addition under construction that officials fear will disturb the
atmosphere of posh Beacon Hill.
   ``It's a piece of architecture that is going to be with us for a
long time if it's not done,'' David Buckley, chairman of the Beacon
Hill Architectural Commission, said Wednesday. ``These things don't
just come and go like flowers in a planting bed.''
   But the owner's attorney, Guy Carbone, said his client is being
treated unfairly because the city decreed that the original
119-year-old row house be torn down during renovations because of a
rotting foundation, then rebuilt with the facade restored to its
original condition.
   ``The whole issue here is that once the city ordered the
building torn down, can the architectural commission order us to
rebuild it as it was in 1869,'' Carbone said.
   ``That's an interesting opinion,'' said Buckley, who responded
by pointing to court decisions backing the commission's stand.
   The commission in 1985 approved some renovation for Parker's
house, but did not approve an additional floor, Buckley said. The
commission allowed him to take down the facade, but said bricks had
to be removed by hand, numbered and put back in place.
   Court papers said in addition to the extra floor, many of the
bricks were tossed into a pile and broken and some instructions on
maintaining the facade were not followed.
   The owner, Chase F. Parker, declined to comment Wednesday.
   Carbone said Parker planned to build a town house that would fit
in with other structures in the area. ``We tried very, very hard to
satisfy the commission,'' he said.
   The Beacon Hill Historic District was established in 1955 to
preserve the neighborhood as an example of old Boston, said John
Devereaux, an attorney for the commission.
   Much of the area, home to the well-heeled of 18th-century
Boston, has been transformed inwardly into condominium
developments. But the outward facades remain for the most part town
houses of dark-red brick, some with ornate windows and entryways.
   Zoning regulations in the area would allow a fifth floor, but
the architectural commission, a five-member panel appointed by the
mayor, has final say on any structural changes visible to the
public.
   Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Catherine White on June 21
upheld the commission's decision forbidding the fifth floor and
ordered Parker to tear down construction. A hearing date has not
been set in the case, currently before the state Appeals Court.
   While the case is pending, white sheets are draped over part of
the building and a temporary roof has been erected to cover initial
construction above the fourth floor.
   Carbone noted that other renovated buildings in the district are
taller than the original structures.
   The commission does not try to maintain strict preservation, and
allows new materials to be used and changes to be made if they are
judged to be in keeping with the area, Buckley said.
   But adding a floor to a building would change the character of
the structure, he said.
   ``There hasn't been an enormous problem in having people
conform,'' he said. ``In fact, there's quite a bit of support for
it.''

<HEAD>Magistrate Recommends Contempt Citation Against Agriculture
Secretary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal magistrate has recommended that
a contempt citation be brought against Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng for failing to fully obey a court order barring the
USDA from calling in crop-storage loans.
   Magistrate Janice Symchych made the recommendation Tuesday to
U.S. District Judge Harry MacLaughlin, who had issued a preliminary
injunction July 21 against the Agriculture Department's
loan-cancellation plan.
   Lyng has 10 days from Tuesday in which to file objections to the
contempt recommendation.
   According to the Minnesota attorney general's office, which is a
party to the suit against the USDA, the department did not comply
with the injunction until July 29, when it announced that certain
loans could be extended until Aug. 31. The announcement came after
many farmers already had settled their loans with the USDA, the
attorney general's office said.
   Symchych recommended all loans due and payable after July 22 be
extended. For loans that matured on July 31 and were settled by
farmers before any extensions were available, Symchych recommended
that USDA restore those farmers to the position they would have
been in had the federal agency obeyed the injunction.
   ``The court cannot allow defendants (USDA) to circumvent the
purpose of the injunction by simply employing new tactics or
strategies which achieve the same unlawful result,'' Symchych said
in a report.
   The federal reserve program allows farmers to hold surplus
grains off the market while receiving government price supports and
storage fees. In effect, the grain is collateral for the loans.
Because the drought has tightened grain supplies, the Agriculture
Department is calling the loans in order to force the farmers to
sell the grain.
   In addition to the contempt citation, Symchych recommended the
USDA be fined $1,000 for each loan it canceled after MacLaughlin's
injunction went into effect. Symchych also recommended the USDA be
given until Sept. 30 to comply with the order.
   Lyng was on vacation and unavailable for comment, USDA spokesman
Dave Lane said Wednesday.
   Richard W. Goldberg, acting undersecretary for international
affairs and commodity programs for the USDA, said he would not
comment on the matter because it is under litigation.
   Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III brought the suit against
the department on behalf of Agriculture Commissioner Jim Nichols
and seven Minnesota farmers. He contended that the Agriculture
Department failed to go through the formal government rule-making
procedures before it decided to stop extending the loans.
   The USDA, meanwhile, announced Tuesday that it would stop
extending crop loans as of Wednesday, irrespective of MacLaughlin's
injunction. The announcement came before Symchych's recommendation
was issued.
   Humphrey and Nichols were expected to seek a court hearing this
week to halt implementation of the USDA's new plan.

   Flooding in six northern states has
forced about 100,000 people from their homes, the president's
office said Wednesday.
   The flooding has destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of
crops and killed thousands of farm animals, according to televised
news reports.
   President Virgilio Barco has asked Colombia's congress to
approve $8 million in disaster assistance to the states of Cordoba,
Atlantico, Sucre, Magadalena, Cesar and Bolivar.
   Heavy rain is expected to continue for the next few days,
Colombia's weather service said Wednesday.
   The biggest river in the region, the Magdalena, overflowed its
banks Saturday.
   The flooding has caused an increase in the number of mosquitoes,
the public health department for the state of Cordoba said in a
news release.
   Malaria and dengue fever, both carried by mosquitoes, is common
in the Magdalena river region.
   Twenty people have been bitten by poisonous snakes in Cordoba
since flooding began there two weeks ago, the health department
said.

<HEAD>4,000 Starved To Death In South, Tens of Thousands Threatened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four thousand men, women and children
have died of starvation and tens of thousands residing in the
war-torn regions of southern Sudan face a similar fate, officials
said Wednesday.
   Angelo Beda, president of Sudan's Council for the South, said
the only way to save those starving in the Equatoria and Bahr
el-Ghazal regions was with emergency air shipments of food and
medical supplies.
   In Ireland, the Rev. Aengus Finucane, director of the
Dublin-based aid agency CONCERN said about 40 people were dying
daily at a refugee camp in el Meriam, 500 miles south of Khartoum,
and that about 2 million people faced death from the ravages of war
and starvation.
   Beda said most southerners abandoned their crops and cattle in
the countryside and fled to towns and cities because of fierce
fighting in the five-year civil war. He said residents are being
beseiged by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army and dying of
starvation as food supplies dwindle.
   Beda, whose group includes southern political representatives
from Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's government, said record floods
in Sudan earlier this month diverted the attention of Western
relief organizations from what he called the ``catastrophe'' of the
south.
   ``Four thousand people have died of hunger in (the town of)
Aweil so far,'' he said. Aweil, in the Bahr el-Ghazal region, is
587 miles southwest of Khartoum.
   Asked about Finucane's estimates for the number of southerners
dying, Beda said he lacked exact figures, ``but, yes, you can say
the reports about people dying by thousands is correct.''
   In Torit, 787 miles south of Khartoum, about 10,000 people were
stranded without food and facing starvation, Beda said. He said the
bishop of Torit described the situation as critical.
   Beda also said Wau, 662 miles southwest of the capital, faced a
similar situation as did residents in Juba, 750 miles south of
Khartoum, and Malakal, 425 miles south of the capital.
   ``For at least four months, no food or essential commodities has
reached those towns. No medicine has reached them either, so people
die,'' Beda said.
   He said the only way to save those people was to make emergency
air drops of food and medical supplies.
   The rebel SPLA in recent years has shot down two civilian
aircrafts, killing 73 people, and several military planes. It has
accused the government of using civilian and relief planes to
transport military troops and equipment and has threatened to shoot
down any plane flying over the south.
   The civil war has forced at least 820,000 people to flee their
homes in southern Sudan and trek to neighbouring Ethiopia. They
usually head by foot or by train to southern cities and towns that
are controlled by the army, or northward to Khartoum.
   In 1986, Western relief agencies warned that up to 2 million
southerners faced starvation because they were dependent on relief
food in the cities and because the rebels controlled 90 percent of
the countryside, making it almost impossible to get supplies to
them.
   Despite the rebel attacks, relief agencies have been
sporadically flown in supplies from neighbouring countries, or used
trucks, trains and barges from Khartoum.
   The rebels, mostly Christians and animists, are seeking more
autonomy as well as economic and administrative reforms from the
Moslem majority government in the north.

<HEAD>HUD Official Voices `Fear and Alarm' Over Housing Sale Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development voiced concern Wednesday that recent court
decisions could cost the agency more than $3 billion a year and
bankrupt its single-family mortgage insurance fund.
   Thomas T. Demery, assistant housing secretary and commissioner
of the Federal Housing Administration, expressed what he described
as ``fear and alarm'' over a decision in U.S. District Court here
Tuesday that prevents HUD from selling any of the 47,000 foreclosed
homes in its inventory.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene temporarily blocked HUD
from selling the homes to the highest bidder unless they are for
the benefit of homeless or low-income people.
   Demery, along with HUD general counsel Michael Dorsey, said
Greene's decision, if upheld, would halt FHA property sales which
provide about $3.2 billion in annual revenues. The FHA fund has
current reserves of about $6 billion.
   ``Imposing a freeze on our disposition program could well
threaten the financial solvency of FHA since our basic home
mortgage insurance program receives no congressional appropriations
and has no authority to borrow from the Treasury,'' Demery told
reporters.
   Demery and Dorsey said HUD would ask Congress to clarify whether
the department has complied with legislation last year that was
intended to benefit the homeless.
   Greene's temporary restraining order expires Sept. 14. U.S.
District Judge Oliver Gasch, who has jurisdiction over the case,
will schedule further action.
   Greene issued his order in response to a plea by the National
Housing Law Project, one of the homeless advocacy groups fighting
HUD's single-family home sales policy, because HUD planned to sell
170 homes in metropolitan Washington on Wednesday.
   Last week, the project succeeded in preventing HUD from selling
200 such homes in Michigan.
   Demery said the FHA insures more than 6 million home mortgages
with outstanding balances of nearly $230 billion. In recent years,
he said, 30 to 40 percent of all new homes sold for less than
$100,000 have been insured by the FHA.
   ``This is a program that has helped 17 million American families
obtain home ownership and has received bipartisan support from all
segments,'' he said.
   ``It would be tragic if we were to put a program like this at
risk _ especially at a time when there is a growing consensus over
over the need to do more to help reverse the recent trend toward
declining home ownership rates,'' Demery said.
   ``We need to do more to help working class families obtain home
ownership _ not less,'' he said.
   Demery said HUD has 400 homes under lease or that have been sold
to homeless persons.
   ``We want this number to grow, and are eager to work with
homeless advocates to devise ways that we can make more FHA
foreclosed homes available,'' Demery said.
   ``But what we object to is a strategy that pits the needs of
hard-working families who want to buy modestly priced homes with
the needs of the homeless,'' he said.
   ``It shouldn't be a case of one versus the other. And surely we
can find ways of doing more to help the homeless without
bankrupting the FHA fund.''

<HEAD>Drought Raising Veggie Prices for Consumers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought continues to put the bite on consumer
food dollars, including higher prices for fresh vegetables this
summer and signs that processed items also will be more costly in
1989, an Agriculture Department report said Wednesday.
   Prices paid to growers for fresh vegetables jumped more than 21
percent from July to August, the report said. And this summer's
prices overall could be up 10 percent from the third quarter of
1987, a period when fresh vegetable prices usually decline.
   ``However, this year's extremely dry weather, coupled with
minimum irrigation in the North Central states, reduced supplies
and put upward pressure on prices in midsummer,'' the department
Economic Research Service said. ``As local supplies tighten,
consumers likely will be be more dependent than usual on vegetables
shipped from more distant areas.''
   The government's Consumer Price Index for fresh vegetables,
including potatoes, rose 4 percent from June to July and was up 5
percent from July 1987. Potatoes, lettuce and tomatoes are the most
important in the fresh vegetable index.
   Retail potato prices were up seasonally in July and were also
boosted slightly by the drought's impact on the summer crop.
   ``Lettuce prices tend to be seasonally low in July, and were
slightly lower this July due to large California supplies,'' the
report said. ``Tomato prices tend to be down in July, as tomatoes
are the most commonly grown vegetable in home gardens, which
reduces summer demand. However, the drought boosted this July's
prices.''
   The CPI for processing vegetables is generally flat in the
summer, but it rose 1 percent in July, the report said. Prices are
expected to continue rising through 1989 as higher wholesale costs
work through the marketing pipeline.

<HEAD>Teamsters and Producers Try to Avert Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A contract dispute between Hollywood
producers and the Teamsters union is threatening to disrupt the
film and television industry as it recovers from the five-month
scriptwriters' strike.
   The Teamsters contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers expired July 30, and only day-to-day contract
extensions have prevented the Teamsters from striking.
   The union was scheduled to announce late Wednesday the results
of a vote on the producers' latest contract offer, with members
expected to reject the contract by an overwhelming margin.
   Another negotiating session was set for Thursday morning.
   A walkout by the Teamsters, representing 2,200 film and
television drivers, could put a severe crimp on Hollywood
production as it recovers from the writers' walkout, which ended
Aug. 7.
   Earl Bush, secretary-treasurer for the Teamsters Local 399, has
said that the producers' last proposal is the most ``insulting
offer'' he has seen in 43 years as a Teamster.
   The contract proposal, Bush said, would require about half the
Teamsters Local 399 members to take $2.61-per-hour pay cuts. The
producers are offering a minimum salary for those drivers of $14 an
hour, down from $16.61. Big-rig drivers earn more, and producers
plan to raise their salaries.
   The producers have said that union concessions are necessary to
keep costs down and prevent so-called ``runaway'' production, where
film and televison crews move to non-union states and countries.
   ``The issue is competitiveness,'' said Herb Steinberg, a
spokesman for the alliance. ``We want to remain competitive in this
market and keep production here.'' The producers estimate that
runaway production has cost Hollywood Teamsters $14 million in lost
wages and benefits during the last two years.
   The producers also want to redefine rules for overtime pay.

<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines Inc. has grown from a cropduster
to the nation's third-largest airline since it began operations six
decades ago flying from Dallas to Jackson, Miss.
   A Delta Boeing 727, Flight 1141 which originated in Jackson,
crashed on takeoff Wednesday at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.
   The crash came three years and 26 days after a Delta Lockheed
L-1011 jet crashed at the same airport, killing 137 people.
Lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages from that crash are
still in court, although some already have resulted in
multimillion-dollar judgments against Delta.
   Last year, Delta suffered a spate of embarrassments: Pilots
landed at the wrong airport or on the wrong runway; one plane
plummeted toward the ocean because the pilot mistakenly shut off
the engines; another plane was involved in a near miss over the
Atlantic.
   Last year, Delta also grew by acquiring Western Airlines in an
$860 million merger.
   Through it all, Delta has maintained a reputation as a well-run,
safe and financially secure airline.
   ``I don't think the reputation is undeserved,'' and it probably
won't change, said Robert Decker, an airline industry analyst with
Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   ``If you ask people in airline maintenance who they think does
the best job, Delta's almost always the name mentioned first,''
said John Pincavage, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the airline is not afraid its
reputation will suffer greatly because of the crash.
   ``You have to realize Delta flies more flights than any airline
in the world,'' he said. ``We operate more flights so we have
greater exposure. You have to put it in perspective. .... You look
at our overall record and it's quite good.''
   Delta's common stock dropped $1 a share at news of the crash,
but recovered half the loss by the close of trading to stand at
$46.50.
   Analysts attributed the stock drop as much to a round of fare
reductions touched off Tuesday by Continental Airlines as to the
crash itself.
   Anthony Hatch, an analyst in New York with Argus Research,
called Delta ``a terrifically well run airline.'' He said Delta
survived the embarrassing incidents last year because ``it had so
much good will in the bank.''
   Eastern Airlines, Delta's chief competitor, has been rocked by
safety investigations of its aircraft and labor troubles. The
airline has cut back on its routes; a plan to lay off 4,000
employees was blocked this week by a federal judge.
   Delta began corporate life as the world's first cropdusting
service _ Huff Daland Dusters, a division of Huff Daland
Manufacturing Co. of Ogdensburg, N.Y.
   Then in 1928, the company, led by Collett Woolman, broke away
from the parent company to form Delta Air Service with headquarters
in Monroe, La. Passenger service began in 1929 with 90 mph flights
from Dallas to Jackson.
   Woolman, who ran the company until his death in 1966, set the
tone for Delta including a unique tradition of having pilots greet
passengers as they leave each flight.
   The company changed its name in 1930 to Delta Air Corp. and
later to Delta Air Lines Inc., and moved headquarters to Atlanta in
the early '40s. For the annual meeting, however, the company leaves
its headquarters at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport and
returns to Monroe.
   Delta's growth was spurred in the early years as it added routes
in the South and merged with other airlines in 1953 and 1972. But
the biggest step came in 1987, when Delta completed an $860 million
merger with Western Airlines Inc., making it the nation's third
largest airline in terms of numbers of passengers carried.
   Delta, which has 48,000 employees, posted a profit of $306.83
million on $6.92 billion in revenues during the fiscal year ended
June 30.

<HEAD>Mail Workers Launch 24-Hour Strike</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 13 grafs to UPDATE with comment from union,
private mail carriers; picks up 10th pvs: `Alan Tuffin...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of government postal workers sealed mail
boxes, stopped sorting letters and walked off their routes
Wednesday to protest bonus payments that vary by region.
   Private delivery companies welcomed the extra business, saying
it will prove they can compete.
   The Union of Communication Workers called a 24-hour nationwide
strike, but the Royal Mail disputed the union's claim that nearly
all its 140,000 letter carriers and letter sorters had stopped
working.
   ``It's very patchy, a patchy situation,'' said Sally Williams, a
Royal Mail spokeswoman. ``While there's certainly support for the
strike, nevertheless quite a number of staff have turned up for
work.''
   She said the post office had repeatedly offered to continue
talks with the union and had been ``as flexible as we can.''
   The union's other 60,000 members either work for the state
telephone monopoly or for the post office in administration or
counter services, which were not involved in the dispute, said a
union spokesman.
   Ms. Williams said mail was being sorted and delivered in some
areas, particularly the southeast and southwest, although she did
not have figures for how many employees had shown up for work.
   Counter services were not disrupted at any of the striking Royal
Mail post offices in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,
although letter boxes had been sealed, she said.
   It was the first national strike at Royal Mail since a 1971
walkout which collapsed after 47 days.
   The stoppage increased demands for Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative government to end the Royal Mail's
near-monopoly on the delivery of letters and parcels. Since she
came to power in 1979, her government has sold off to private
enterprise large sectors of state-owned assets under its
denationalization program.
   The Royal Mail has the exclusive right to collect, sort and
deliver all mail with a postal charge of less than one pound
($1.60). The cost of mailing an ordinary letter in Britain through
the Royal Mail is 18 pence (30 cents).
   TNT Mailfast, a company claiming to be the largest private
carrier in Britain, said business rose 500 percent on Wednesday and
was expected to produce long-term benefits.
   ``People are getting a bit upset about the threat of strikes all
the time,'' said general manager John Hartle. ``More and more
people who come over to us are tending to stay.''
   Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the union, said the union was
``going to throw the nation's mail into chaos.''
   The dispute concerns bonus payments for new recruits in London
and southeastern England, where living costs are higher than in the
rest of Britain and where the Royal Mail has trouble recruiting and
keeping staff because of high employment and competition for staff.
   The union wants the bonuses paid to all new recruits throughout
the country or not paid at all. Tuffin said he fears the Royal Mail
management eventually wants to introduce differentials in basic pay
for different areas and end national pay bargaining agreements.
   The bonuses range from $12.67 to $33.80 a week. The Royal Mail
said that with the bonuses, first-year recruits in central London
earn a basic $206 a week. It said the average wage for all postal
workers in central London was $405 a week.

<HEAD>Jackson And Koch Meet And Make Up, Warily</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson and
New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch promised Wednesday to put aside
their political animosity and work together to elect Michael
Dukakis to the presidency.
   ``April 1988 is behind us. November 8 and the elections of next
year are ahead of us,'' Jackson said after a more than two-hour
peace session convened by Gov. Mario Cuomo at his Manhattan office.
``We're moving in that direction.''
   Then Koch, who apologized for the stridency of his attacks on
Jackson during New York's primary in April, said, ``I couldn't add
a sentence that would improve'' on Jackson's words.
   Jackson and Koch said the focus of the meeting was finding a
``common ground,'' centering on their commitment to the Dukakis
campaign, voter registration and an agenda of urban policies.
   Democratic nominee Dukakis is battling Republican George Bush in
a close race for the White House.
   Last April, Koch endorsed Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee in
the Democratic primary and suggested that Jews would be ``crazy''
to vote for Jackson in light of his position on the Middle East.
   On Wednesday, Koch praised Jackson for his ``generosity of
spirit.''
   But Jackson's actions contradicted the upbeat words. At no point
during the news conference did the Democratic leader stand beside
Koch, and he kept a dour expression, despite several attempts at
levity by the mayor.
   Cuomo, who stood between the two men as they addressed a
jam-packed news conference, said it was difficult for Koch and
Jackson _ but especially for Jackson _ to sit down and discuss a
truce.
   ``We decided it is better to compromise and conciliate than
criticize. We should replace criticism with constructive
compromise,'' Cuomo said.
   Jackson told the news conference that it was ``in our best
interest to act like mature adults and stay above attacks on
integrity.''
   Jackson said he bore no animosity toward Koch, who seemed to
surprise the civil rights activist by shaking his hand after
addressing the crowd.

<HEAD>Saudis To Cut Spending On Domestic Wheat Production Subsidies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has decided to cut spending on
domestic production subsidies for the 1989 wheat crop in an effort
to reduce the need for export subsidies, an Agriculture Department
report said Wednesday.
   ``However, at this point the subsidy reduction will affect only
large farms, which account for about 10 percent of total Saudi
wheat production,'' the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
reported.
   The government of Saudi Arabia has been subsidizing exports of
domestic wheat surpluses since 1985-86. As a result, Saudi wheat
has competed against U.S. wheat in China, Indonesia and South
Korea, the report said.
   In addition to the wheat subsidy reduction, the Saudi government
will attempt to reduce the country's reliance on barley imports by
requiring large-scale wheat producers to plant as much barley as
they do wheat.

<HEAD>Dog Carcasses Dumped in Water May Have Caused Seal Epidemic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The diseased bodies of more than 1,000
dogs dumped off Greenland may have caused an epidemic that has
killed at least 11,000 seals in northern Europe's coastal waters,
the Swedish news agency TT said Wednesday.
   Sled dogs on the Arctic island died of distemper early in 1988
and the first discoveries of swollen, dead seals were reported in
April in Denmark.
   Western European experts said earlier this week the Canine
Distemper Virus (CDV) or a similar one killed the seals.
   ``We knew that Greenland was ravished by the distemper disease
in March,'' TT quoted seal expert Berndt Klingeborn as saying. ``We
first thought that the seals had contaminated the dogs, but after
hearing that the carcasses were thrown into the water it appears to
be the other way around.''
   Thousands of seals migrate from Greenland to Western European
waters each year in search of food.
   Distemper virus causes infections of the respiratory and central
nervous systems and digestive tracts in both dogs and seals.
   Greenland officials have said the virus was brought to Greenland
by foxes, ravens and possibly polar bears across the frozen Baffin
Bay from the Canadian Arctic, where distemper was reported in
October.
   Seal experts say up to 80 percent of the seals in affected
waters will die but those remaining population will be immune to
the disease.
   The virus has been most devastating off Scandinavia, with 3,400
seals dead in Sweden and almost 3,000 in Denmark. About 3,900
others died off West Germany, 600 in Norwegian waters and 175 off
the Netherlands.

   Gunther Von Fritsch, an original
director of ``The March of Time'' newsreels who later directed TV
drama including ``The Lawman'' and ``77 Sunset Strip,'' has died of
a stroke. He was 82.
   Von Fritsch died Saturday night at Huntington Memorial Hospital.
   Born in Pula, Yugoslavia, of Austrian parents, Von Fritsch came
to the United States in 1930 after graduating from The Government
Film School in Paris.
   He started his American film career as an editor of foreign
films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
   He directed ``The March of Time'' _ a newsreel series shown in
movie theaters before the feature attraction. The series, launched
in 1935 by Time Inc., was considered revolutionary at its
introduction.
   Von Fritsch entered the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1943, where he
remained until the end of World War II. After the war, he was
involved in the making of Army training films for the U.S. State
Department in West Berlin.
   Von Fritsch directed several television series in the 1950s and
1960s, including ``Flash Gordon,'' ``77 Sunset Strip,'' and ``The
Lawman.'' He also directed a Disney feature film called
``Snowbear.''
   Von Fritsch is survived by his wife, Hinemoa; daughters
Antoinette Beatty of Albuquerque, N.M., and Katharine Deyhimy of
Thousand Oaks; and two grandchildren.

<HEAD>Relief For Fire-Ravaged Northwest Predicted in October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fire-ravaged Northwest can expect little
relief from unusually hot, dry weather until a trend toward rain
and cooler temperatures begins in October, the National Weather
Service said Wednesday.
   Above-normal temperatures will persist over much of the West
during the next five days through the Labor Day weekend, government
forecasters said, while seasonable temperatures can be expected
elsewhere. Widespread rain will fall from the Great Lakes region to
the Eastern states.
   The picture will remain pretty much the same through Sept. 10,
the service said. Most of the nation except for the East and Gulf
coasts will be dry, with high temperatures over most of the West
and Northern Plains states and cool weather east of the Mississippi
Valley.
   The Pacific Northwest, which has battled widespread forest fires
in recent weeks, will continue to suffer abnormally warm, dry
weather throughout September until a wet, cooling trend begins.
   ``Only the longer outlook through November brings cool, wet
conditions to the Northwest,'' the service said. It should be
warmer in the Southwest and California and most areas of the East,
with rain extending up the Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the
Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic regions.
   Streamflows are expected to remain below average across much of
the country. Although tropical storm Chris dumped four to six
inches of rain across the Atlantic Coast this week, the boost to
streamflows in that area will subside in a few days, the forecast
said.
   Water reserves at major reservoirs remain average to below
average for this time of year across much of the country, the
Weather Service said.

<TEXT>
   Despite Wednesday's fiery crash at the
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, the Boeing 727 has been a workhorse for
many of the world's airlines for nearly 25 years and has garnered
rave reviews for its safety after a rocky start.
   ``It is the most reliable airplane in the world,'' said Gary
Reich, who analyzes the aerospace industry for the New York
investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton. ``It has flown through
storms and turbulence, and it's performed beautifully and
reliably.''
   Before they were discontinued in 1984, The Boeing Co.
manufactured 1,831 of them. Since the first went into service in
1964, 53 have been lost in accidents, including Wednesday's crash
and four that were destroyed in terrorist attacks, said Jack
Gamble, a Boeing spokesman in Renton, Wash.
   Reich said that in the early years of the 727, the nation's
airline fleets were just entering the jet age and several of the
planes crashed because pilots were unaccustomed to the rapidity
with which the aircraft descended during landings.
   Pilots had to be retrained to cope with the so-called high sink
rate.
   In the course of those accidents, another problem was revealed,
Reich said. In the early models, lines brought fuel along the top
of the fuselage from the wings to the three engines at the rear,
which meant that in accidents, coach passengers would be doused
with burning fuel. Within a few years, the lines were repositioned
to the bottom portion of the fuselage.
   ``They had some difficulties in the early years, but those go
back to the mid- to late '60s,'' said Roger Fleming, vice president
for technical planning and development for the Air Transport
Association, the airline industry trade group. ``They've been a
highly reliable aircraft.''
   Over the years, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued
122 ``airworthiness directives'' ordering the owners of 727s to
make specific adjustments to the planes, FAA spokesman Mitch Barker
said in Seattle. He said that represents ``a normal number for an
aircraft that old.''
   Of those, however, only 12 applied to the model 200, the longer,
modernized version of the plane that Boeing began delivering to its
customers in December 1967. In all, 1,260 of the 727s manufactured
were model 200s, including the jet that crashed in Dallas on
Wednesday. The earlier versions were model 100s.
   One recurring problem was with the aircraft's landing gear,
which Barker said were complex and had been ``kind of a headache.''
He said he did not have details on what the problem was.
   Gamble said the first crash involving a 727 occurred in August
1965, when one of the aircraft plummeted into Lake Michigan. The
next involved an American Airlines 727 that crashed in Cincinnati
in November 1965, followed three days later by an accident at Salt
Lake City. The Cincinnati and Salt Lake City incidents were caused
by the pilots' unfamiliarity with aircraft's rapid rate of descent,
he said.
   Among the craft's more recent accidents, a Pan American 727
crashed after takeoff in Kenner, La., on July 9, 1982 and 153
people were killed. And on Sept. 25, 1978, a Pacific Southwest
Airlines Boeing 727 and private Cessna 172 collided over San Diego,
Calif., killing 144.
   The aircraft remains the most widely used jet in the U.S.
airline fleet. According to airline consultant George James, of
3,476 passenger and cargo aircraft used by American carriers, 1,148
are 727s. The second most commonly used craft is the Boeing 737,
with 634 in use.
   The 727 is being phased out for economic reasons. Airlines have
have found it less expensive to use more modern aircraft that have
only two engines and require two pilots instead of the crew of
three needed to fly 727s.

   Survivors of Delta Flight 1141 said they
heard the jetliner crumple moments before the crash Wednesday and
escaped by leaping onto the plane's red-hot wings.
   ``You're hoping you weren't going to die,'' said Penn Waugh, a
Dallas attorney who was on the Boeing 727 when it crashed on
takeoff from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, en route to
Salt Lake City. ``It's getting smoky and you're just trying to get
the hell out of the plane.''
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said 13 people were confirmed dead
and 94 survived.
   ``We were just terrified,'' said Mona Thomason, who escaped with
scrapes and bruises. ``We jumped on the wing, but it looked like we
were jumping into a pit of fire.'' She reported seeing a woman with
two children: ``She got one of them out, but I'm afraid the other
one was caught in the fire.''
   Passenger Peter Wright of Dallas said the aircraft veered to the
right on take-off, and he heard a banging noise under the carriage.
   ``Then someone said, `We're not going to make it!''' he said.
``After the crash someone kicked the door open. I jumped on the
plane, and I was lucky because I just hurt my wrist.''
   Wright's traveling companion, Geoff Parkes, said the plane lost
power as it took off, and he saw the right wing tip hit the ground.
Flames shot past his window, and jet fuel dripped down the windows.
   ``People were saying, `Let's get out of here! Let's get out!'''
Parkes said. ``I jumped on the wing following Peter and got out.''
   Jane Wood, who is six months pregnant, and her sons, Adam, 2,
and Evan, 5, escaped without serious injury by leaping through a
crack near the bulkhead.
   ``It was a big fire,'' Evan said. ``We jumped out, but we
weren't scared.''
   Jim Hammock of Garland, a Dallas suburb, said the plane bounced
three times on takeoff and skidded off the runway.
    ``We didn't make 50 feet in the air. We skidded and then the
engine exploded. There was pandemonium,'' said Hammock, whose right
sleeve was streaked with jet fuel. ``People were jumping on the
plane's wing and burning themselves on it because it was so
red-hot.''
   Melissa Jane Lewis of Tupelo, Miss., said she remembers praying
out loud and saying, ``Oh God, here we go'' as the jet went down.
   ``I felt the engines losing power and noises like tires blowing
out on takeoff,'' said Lewis, who suffered only a bruise on her
leg. ``The fuselage filled with smoke and there was a lot of noise.
   ``I hung on until the emergency door next to me opened, then I
climbed out on the wing and hit the ground running.''

<HEAD>Americans Negotiate for Possible Return Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American oilmen are negotiating quietly in
hopes of resuming Libyan operations if the next U.S. administration
ends or modifies the economic embargo imposed on Moammar Gadhafi's
government in 1985.
   In the past two years, the chairman of Libya's state petroleum
company has met with U.S. oil company officials in Geneva, Paris
and other West European cities, a West European oil company
official said Wednesday.
   He said the two sides are discussing a possible return of the
Americans under terms of an agreement signed a few months after
President Reagan imposed the embargo on Libya in 1986.
   The agreement on July 1, 1986, froze American oil company assets
and allowed the Libyans to work their oil fields, the Western
source said, with Libya assuming all costs but also taking all the
income.
   Before the embargo, Libya got 51 percent of the oil produced by
U.S. companies. The agreement provides for the same split if the
embargo is lifted and the source said of the Americans: ``They will
return.''
   U.S. companies said to be involved are Occidental Petroleum
Corp., Oasis Oil and a consortium of Conoco, Marathon and Amerada
Hess.
   The 1986 agreement expires June 30, 1989, but if the Americans
are not back by then an extension probably will be arrianged
because both sides are eager to do business again, the source said.
   An official of the state oil company said: ``We are waiting to
see what happens at the start of next year,'' and expressed a
common Libyan opinion that restrictions might be relaxed when
Reagan leaves office.
   All those who commented did so on condition of anonymity.
   Reagan imposed the sanctions in January 1986 because of
Gadhafi's alleged support of terrorism, and forbade Americaans to
work in Libya.
   The work ban has been costly for Libya. The state oil company
official said it replaced the departing American workers by
advertising around the world for highly skilled managers and
technicians.
   He said the places were filled by Britons, Canadians, Swedes,
Indians and French workers, but at a high cost. About 400 Americans
worked in the Libyan oil industry before the embargo, he said.
   Spare parts for American equipment also had to be obtained
elsewhere at higher prices.
   Lower world prices have caused Libya's oil revenue to decline
from $22 billion in 1980 to $6 billion in 1986.

   Republican George Bush promised action to reduce acid rain on
Wednesday and declared ``I am an environmentalist.'' Rival Michael
Dukakis shot back: ``Talk about an election-year convert.''
   Seeking to gain the initiative after two weeks of moribund
campaigning, the Democratic presidential nominee delivered a broad
attack on Bush for a second day, ridiculing his statements on the
environment and demanding an explanation of his role in the
Iran-Contra debacle.
   Bush, campaigning in Michigan, avoided mention of his rival's
name _ a new course after weeks of calculated attacks. But his
Republican running mate Dan Quayle picked up the cudgel and
denounced Dukakis as a ``defeatest liberal.''
   The Republicans continued to poke fun at Dukakis's aged snow
blower that became a symbol of his frugality at the Democratic
convention.
   ``His ideas are as old as that 25-year-old snow blower,'' Quayle
said in Baton Rouge, La.
   Dukakis campaign strategists were targeting Quayle, the Indiana
senator whose selection stunned even Republican insiders. Dukakis
campaign manager Susan Estrich said they would depict his selection
as an indication of poor judgment by Bush, and would make that one
of the central themes of the fall campaign.
   ``One issue we are certain to hear more of from Democrats across
the board is the selection of Senator Quayle and his record and
qualifications,'' she said at a briefing in Boston.
   Quayle was unbowed by the prospect of two more months of
personal attack, saying, ``I can stand the heat and I'll stay in
the kitchen.''
   A new ABC-Washington Post poll released Wednesday found twice as
many voters thought the Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen was more qualified than Quayle. But two-thirds said
Quayle should remain on the ticket.
   The poll showed the presidential race a statistical dead heat _
Dukakis had 48 percent to Bush's 47 percent, within the 3.5-point
margin of error of the survey Aug. 24-30 of 1,129 registered,
likely voters.
   Bush stood on the Michigan shore of Lake Erie to deliver a
speech aimed at separating himself from the Reagan administration
with more activist positions on major environmental issues of acid
rain, the ``greenhouse'' effect and pollution of waters.
   ``Polluters should pay,'' the vice president said. ``I am an
environmentalist, always have been, from my earliest days growing
up and then as a congressman ... and I always will be.''
   Bush planned a trip onto his rival's home ground on Thursday
with a visit to Boston Harbor aimed at making the harbor's
long-standing pollution problem an embarrassment to the
Massachusetts governor.
   Attempting a pre-emptive strike, Dukakis blasted the Reagan
administraiton for cutting funding for the Clean Water Act, some of
which could have been used for the harbor cleanup.
   ``We are doing it, no thanks to Mr. Bush or the
administration,'' Dukakis said.
   He displayed scorn for Bush's promise of action on acid rain,
saying Bush really would rather spend money on the Star Wars
space-based defense program than on environmental protection.
``Talk about an election-year convert,'' Dukakis said.
   Damaging increases in the acidity of rainfall has been tied to
emissions from coal-fired power plants and other sources, including
auto exhausts.
   ``On the question of acid rain, the time for study alone has
passed,'' Bush said. ``We know enough to begin taking steps to
limit future damage ... as president, I will ask for a program to
cut millions of tons of sulfer dioxide emissions by the year 2,000
and to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as well.''
   Dukakis appeared at a news conference in Boston with Maine Sen.
George Mitchell, one of the Iran-Contra investigators and co-author
of a book that criticizes Bush's role in the missiles-for-hostages
deal with Iran.
   ``The American people would like to know the answer to a
continuing question,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Mr. Bush, you sat through five meetings, five meetings on the
subject. How can you say now that you did not know that it was a
straight arms-for-hostages deal?'' Dukakis demanded.
   Quayle campaigned before students at Louisiana State University
and toured an Exxon oil refinery. He said he and Bush ``vigorously
disagree'' with Dukakis's opposition to offshore oil exploration.
   Dukakis has called for no new offshore drilling _ and has
stressed that position in California, where it is a major issue.
Campaigning in California in the spring, Bush opposed
administration plans to lease new oil plots off the California
coast and called for more study instead.
   Dukakis left Boston for California, where he planned to campaign
Thursday before stopping in other Western states Friday and
Saturday. Bush was campaigning in the Northeast on Thursday and
Friday.
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Lloyd Bentsen was
vacationing in Wyoming. His Republican counterpart was remaining in
the South the rest of the week.

   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran urged Wednesday that an early exchange of prisoners be
arranged with Iraq, official Tehran radio reported.
   In Paris, the daily newspaper Le Monde quoted Velayati as saying
Iraqi negotiators have dalayed progress on prisoner exchange and
other issues in a settlement of the 8-year-old war.
   He said the purpose was to force concessions from Iran on the
disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms their southern border
and is Iraq's only outlet to the Persian Gulf, Le Monde reported.
   Tehran radio said Velayati made the comments to Iranian
reporters in Geneva, where peace talks were stalled for the fifth
straight day.
   ``Our aim is that the exchange of prisoners of war should take
place as soon as possible,'' Velayati said. ``The very urgent
problems facing Iranian families need to be resolved (so that) our
loved ones, who have been captured, may return to their homes.''
   Iran has listed 46,098 prisoners in its camps, but U.N.
officials say many have not been unregistered and the real number
may be about 70,000.
   Iraq furnished a list of 18,139 Iranian prisoners as of Aug. 1,
but Iraqi authorities told U.N. officials many recent detainees had
not been registered. U.N. officials believe that could bring the
total to 35,000.
   Velayati also called for renewed efforts to return Iraqi
refugees to Iraq, the radio report said.
   Thousands of Kurdish civilians fled to Iran because of battles
between the Iraqi army and Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas. Other
refugees are Shiite Moslems from southern Iraq.
   Velayati declared, according to the radio: ``Fundamental
thinking must be done in order to facilitate the honorable return
of Iraqi refugees, be they Kurds or Arabs, to their own country,
and in order to restore these people's rights.''
   No official count of the refugees has been given.
   Le Monde quoted Velayati as saying the Iraqis hoped to win
sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab, and ``If we give in to these
Iraqi demands, nothing guarantees us that they will not draw up
other conditions just as difficult. Why would we be the only ones
to make concessions?''
   The paper also quoted Velayati as claiming in an interview that
Iraq still hold more than 380 square miles of Iranian territory,
including the towns of Khosravi and Naft Shahr, but Iran had
withdrawn from all Iraqi territory.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush are locked in a dead heat in their presidential race,
according to the latest poll of registered voters released
Wednesday.
   The ABC News@Washington Post survey found Dukakis holding a
one-point lead over Bush _ 48 percent to 47 percent _ that was
negated by the poll's 3.5 percent margin of error.
   The poll of 1,129 likely voters conducted Aug. 24 through
Tuesday night was similar to the last survey which found Bush
leading by two points _ 48 percent to 46 percent. The last poll was
completed Aug. 23.
   Dukakis enjoyed his biggest lead in the ABC News@Washington Post
survey shortly after the Democratic National Convention in July
when he led his GOP opponent by 15 percentage points.
   According to the latest survey, twice as many voters _ 53
percent _ believe Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen is more qualified that his GOP rival Dan Quayle than the
reverse _ 26 percent.
   The poll also found that Bush's aggressive campaign style of the
past few days _ and Dukakis' lack of response _ has had little
effect on two key groups: Democrats who voted for President Reagan
in 1980 and 1984 and independents.
   Among the Reagan Democrats, Dukakis led 58 percent to 34
percent, a marginal change from his 57 percent to 31 percent lead
over Bush last week. The Republican nominee added no new
independents this week although he continues to lead among that
group _ 52 percent to 38 percent.
   The gender gap, in which women's voting patterns vary from men,
narrowed slightly but Dukakis still holds an advantage. In the
latest poll, Dukakis led 51 percent to 43 percent among women
voters while Bush held a 51 percent to 44 percent lead among men.

   An anti-abortion group said Wednesday it will
scale back the sit-ins that have led to hundreds of arrests at
Atlanta abortion clinics and will encourage jailed protesters to
identify themselves and leave jail.
   An abortion clinic official called the moves a defeat for the
New York-based anti-abortion group, Operation Rescue.
   ``In light of all the other false claims they've made, this is a
graceful way to bow out,'' said Lynne Randall, executive director
of the Feminist Women's Health Center.
   But Julie Nash, media coordinator for Operation Rescue,
answered, ``That's wishful thinking on their part. They don't know
us and they don't know what we're capable of.''
   She said the group plans to recruit and conduct training in
non-violent protest techniques for an Oct. 5-8 blitz in Atlanta
comparable to sit-ins staged at New York City abortion clinics in
May. She said 1,648 people were arrested then and some clinics were
temporarily closed.
   About 25 of the more than 700 people arrested in a month of
Atlanta sit-ins remained in jail Wednesday, down from as many as
250 earlier, Ms. Nash said.
   Police spokesman Cal Jackson said 24 protesters were in city
holding facilities at the latest count Tuesday, and a Fulton County
Sheriff's Department officer, who asked not to be identified, said
two protesters were still in the county jail Wednesday.
   Some protesters spent up to 40 days in jail, often fasting,
before giving their names and being released on bond or on their
own recognizance, Ms. Nash said.
   ``The demonstrations will be on a back burner for six weeks. We
might do one a week. ... We're getting ready for a long struggle
here,'' Ms. Nash said.
   Mass arrests of the demonstrators began during the Democratic
National Convention July 19. Many identified themselves only as
Baby John Doe or Baby Jane Doe, in symbolic solidarity with aborted
fetuses, and city officials would not release them until they
provided their real names.
   The demonstrators originally planned to remain jailed only
during the Democratic convention, Ms. Nash said. The organization
dug in and called for more people to go to jail when the city
continued to insist that the protesters identify themselves.
   She said Operation Rescue changed its tactics because of ``the
people in the jail who wanted to come out and recruit.''
   Ms. Randall said the group had to give up because it failed to
pack local jails or to shut down a clinic.
   ``People were disgusted with their tactics,'' Ms. Randall said.
``They were mean and vicious to the clients, to the police, to the
(abortion) providers.''

   Three American servicemen and an
Italian soldier will undergo up to eight weeks' treatment for
third-degree burns suffered in an air show disaster in West
Germany, doctors said Wednesday.
   The four are being treated at Brooke Army Medical Center, where
a family of three Americans also was headed Wednesday after being
put on a plane from a West German hospital.
   The four servicemen arrived early Wednesday via a C-141 cargo
plane. Three were in guarded condition, said Dr. Basil Pruitt, head
of the burn unit.
   They were identified as Air Force Master Sgt. Stephen Hull, 31,
stationed at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio; Army 1st Lt. Kim
Strader, 41, of Salt Lake City; Army Pfc. Myron Riggs, 24, of
Pittsburgh; and Anderea, or Andrew, DelaRosa, 33, a sergeant major
assigned to the Italian Embassy.
   ``In all of the patients, the majority of the burns are
third-degree, which means that ultimately considerable skin
grafting will have to be done to close the wounds,'' Pruitt said at
a news conference.
   He said the four would be in the hospital between six and eight
weeks, but he declined to discuss each case specifically.
   Two suffered from smoke inhalation, one has a head injury and
another has a broken left leg, which may have to be amputated, he
said.
   The victims were among those injured Sunday when three Italian
jets crashed during an air show at Ramstein Air Force Base. More
than 40 people were killed and 500 were injured.
   ``During the first two-to-three-day period, the main
consideration centers on maintaining vital organ function and
preventing shock and then the care centers on the care of the wound
to remove dead tissue and effect a timely closure of the wound by
skin grafting,'' Pruitt said.
   Also on Wednesday, officials said Jeffrey McCanch, his wife,
Tammy, and their 2-year-old son, Jeffrey Jr., were put on a plane
headed to the medical center from West Germany, where they had been
undergoing treatment for injuring suffered in the air show crash.
   On Monday, a five-member team of burn specialists from the
center flew to West Germany to help treat victims.
   The center's 40-bed burn unit has 240 physicians, nurses and
support personnel and is the U.S. military's only burn-treatment
facility. Among the recent patients of the burn unit were sailors
injured during attacks in the Persian Gulf the past 15 months.

   A moderate earthquake jolted northern
Baja California on Wednesday, but there were no reports of damage
or injuries, officials said.
   The quake, which was felt as far north as Orange County in
Southern California, struck at 9:44 a.m. and measured 5.1 on the
Richter scale, said Hall Dailey, spokesman at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif.
   The temblor was centered near Laguna Salada, a small
agricultural community 32 miles south of here and 90 miles
southeast of San Diego, Dailey said.
   ``All is normal,'' said Enrique Haje, a Mexicali Fire Department
training officer. ``The earthquake was very short and there were no
accidents or damage,'' he said.
   ``It was not on any major fault,'' said Jill Hammond of the
seismology laboratory at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La
Jolla, Calif. ``It's really of very little significance. There's
really nothing much down there,'' she added, referring to the arid,
sparsely populated area where the quake was centered.
   Just north of the border in Calexico, Calif., police Cmdr.
Torivio Flores said: ``Some people in the building here felt it.
But it didn't feel like much.''
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage in the local area.

   Prosecutors began an investigation
of the Ramstein air show disaster but said Wednesday no criminal
charges were likely, and officials said they had mistakenly listed
a 4-year-old boy among the dead.
   U.S. officials raised the death count to 52 but the West Germans
said their mistake about the badly burned child lowered their toll
to 48 killed in the crash Sunday of an Italian jet. West German
officials also said up to 30 badly burned survivors may die.
   There was no reason given for the discrepancy between U.S. and
West German figures. The Pentagon has said six of the dead were
Americans, but did not release their names.
   On Wednesday, the Air Force identified one of them as Army Pfc.
Genevieve Riggs, 36, of the 110th Military Police Company in
Pirmasens, West Germany. Her husband, Sgt. Myron Riggs of the
110th, was one of four people evacuated Tuesday to the Brooke Army
Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.
   Many grieving families still had not found missing relatives by
Wednesday and officials said 138 reports of missing persons
remained unresolved. Some badly burned children lay in hospitals,
apparently orphaned by the accident.
   Scores of people were seriously injured when three of 10
low-flying Italian jets collided and one became a fireball that
swept into the crowd during the annual air show at the U.S. Air
Force base in Ramstein.
   The three pilots were killed. The Italian air force official who
coordinated the team's stunts said one caused the crash by flying
into an intersecting maneuver at the wrong altitude and speed.
   Thousands of townspeople, family members, dignitaries and fellow
aviators crowded a small church Wednesday at Udine, Italy, for the
funeral of the pilots _ Lt. Col. Mario Naldini, 38; Lt. Col. Ivo
Nutarelli, 41, and Capt. Giorgio Alessio, 31.
   Juergen Dietzen, the Rhineland-Palatinate state spokesman, said
a ``communications mistake'' caused the erroneous report of the
boy's death. He would not elaborate.
   ``That reduces the death toll to 48,'' he told The Associated
Press, adding that the 4-year-old was ``seriously injured.''
   Dietzen said the bodies of 25 people _ 22 spectators and three
pilots _ had been identified and no U.S. citizens were among them.
Two were children, he said.
   The spokesman, whose state includes Ramstein, said 166 people
still were hospitalized.
   Maj. Kathy White, a U.S. Air Force spokeswoman, told the AP at
Ramstein revised figures showed 52 people dead.
   She did not say whether the 52 included deaths on Wednesday and
there was no explanation for the discrepancy in the death counts. A
day earlier, the Pentagon said its figures showed 40 people had
died, six of them U.S. citizens.
   Wilhelm Sattler, chief prosecutor in Kaiserlautern near
Ramstein, told the AP: ``I have opened an investigation, because
under German law there must be a probe into all cases of violent
death.''
   He said complex legal restrictions involving U.S. troops in West
Germany virtually prohibit bringing American officers before German
courts for criminal trial in a case like the Ramstein crash. He
also said West Germany has no jurisdiction at the Ramstein base.
   ``So, it is highly unlikely that anyone will come before a West
German criminal court in this case,'' Sattler said a telephone
interview. He added that the same applies to Italians involved with
the flying team.
   Sattler confirmed that two individuals and the local branch of
the Greens party had filed criminal complaints alleging negligence.
He said one was against Defense Minister Rupert Scholz and the
other directed at ``those responsible.''
   He said tests of the surviving Italian pilots for alcohol and
drugs were negative but the results on the three who perished were
not yet available.
   Greens party members and others have demanded that Scholz
resign, contending he should have done something about air shows
before the tragedy occurred.
   He ordered a suspension of military air shows after the crash
and said Wednesday his decision also applies to the U.S. Air Force.
``My decision is based on German law. This is within my right, and
also applies to the Allies,'' he told reporters.
   How far the ban extended has been unclear, but Scholz said
Wednesday he expects the United States and other NATO allies to
honor it.
   U.S. officials have asked spectators who made still or moving
pictures of the accident to lend the material to a special board of
investigators trying to determine what went wrong, the unofficial
U.S. military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported.

   The chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said Wednesday the Soviet nuclear power plants he
inspected are run by businesslike workers, but he could not comment
yet on their safety.
   Lando W. Zech Jr. told a news conference his team of U.S.
nuclear experts believes it is too early to form opinions about the
state of Soviet nuclear safety.
   ``We have just started (U.S.-Soviet exchanges) so it is
inappropriate that we draw conclusions,'' he said.
   Among the plants visited was Chernobyl, where a reactor
explosion April 26, 1986, killed 31 people and sent up a huge,
invisible cloud of radioactivity that spread over Europe and
eventually worked its way around the world.
   Zech and Alexander N. Protsenko, chairman of the Soviet
Committee for Utilization of Atomic Energy, signed an agreement
promising cooperation between the Soviet and U.S. governments on
promotion of civilian nuclear safety. Nuclear experts from the two
governments will exchange information, sponsor joint seminars and
regularly visit each other's countries.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev laid the
groundwork for the exchanges at their December summit in Washington.
   ``I think and I hope that this will lead to improved nuclear
reactor safety in both of our countries,'' Zech said.
   He said the people he met at the power plants were ``dedicated
to safety.''
   Delegation members realize the American and Soviet plants have
differences in design, construction and procedures, he said, but
would not elaborate.
   ``We are still assessing these differences,'' he said.
   Protsenko said Zech's private remarks to him after visiting the
nuclear facilities were invariably polite, even when Protsenko
discussed what he believed to be inadequacies.
   ``I found his comments very useful,'' Protsenko said.
   A similar Soviet delegation will visit the United States soon,
but Zech said when and what plants they would visit had not been
decided.

   The Delta Air Lines Boeing 727 jet that
crashed Wednesday at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport had
only minor problems in the last five years, according to Federal
Aviation Administration records.
   A service difficulty report on file at FAA headquarters in
Oklahoma City showed a power controller actuator on a wing flap on
the jet had to be replaced in July 1987 after the aileron flap on
the plane's right wing jammed.
   A power controller actuator in the flap was removed and returned
to the manufacturer, the records show. A new controller was
installed.
   Dave Jimenez, a spokesman for Boeing in Seattle, said the
actuator is like a small pump that is activated as part of the
process of operating the flaps during takeoffs and landings.
   In August 1983, inspectors found two small cracks in the
fuselage skin, the FAA said. The first crack measured one-half inch
in length at the corner of the pilot's window. The second, found in
another inspection the same month, was three-quarters of an inch
long at the upper corner of the captain's windshield, the report
said.
   Bobbie Mardis, a spokeswoman for the FAA, described the problems
as very minor.
   Ms. Mardis said the crew was identified as pilot Larry Davis,
co-pilot Carey Wilson Kirkland Jr. and flight engineer Steven Judd.
According to FAA records, none of the crew members had a record of
an accident, incident or violation, she said.
   The aircraft was built by Boeing in 1973 and delivered new to
Delta.
   Ms. Mardis said the aircraft accident-incident report for the
plane showed that on Nov. 13, 1986, at Raleigh, N.C., the aircraft
didn't stay at the altitude assigned by air traffic controllers.
   The jetliner was was powered by JT8D engines manufactured by
Pratt & Whitney, based in East Hartford, which sent two
investigators to the scene.
   The engines are a mainstay of the airline industry, according to
David M. Long, a Pratt & Whitney spokesman. Long said the company
routinely sends its investigators to crashes in which aircraft are
powered by Pratt & Whitney engines.
   Long said it was ``way to early'' to speculate on the cause of
the crash.
   ``We're just really collecting information and trying to learn
more ourselves. We have learned to wait until the facts come
along,'' Long said.
   The JT8D received its initial certification from the FAA in 1967
and about 10,000 are now in use. It provides a thrust at takeoff of
14,000 to 18,000 pounds, according to Pratt & Whitney documents.
   Problems with JT8D engines were cited as contributing factors in
1985 airline crashes in London and Milwaukee.

   The Environmental Protection Agency on
Wednesday was urged to drop plans to finance a ``Superfund'' study
that some environmental groups said would be used by industry to
weaken the toxic waste cleanup law.
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, supported by other
groups, sent EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas a letter saying the
Superfund study plan ``usurps the legislative function and is a
clear attempt to shift blame for the agency's sorry record.''
   EPA plans to give $2.5 million to the Conservation Foundation
for a major study of the law under the direction of a steering
committee made up of 20 people from industry, the states and four
environmental groups. The law comes up for revision in 1991.
   The steering committee ``includes representatives of industries
that want to repeal the cornerstone of the law, the strict joint
and several liability standard,'' said Bill Walsh of the public
interest group, an advocacy organization that Ralph Nader helped
found.
   ``Taxpayers should not be forced to finance an industry effort
to cripple the Superfund law,'' Walsh said.
   ``Joint and several'' liability means that any company found to
have contributed to dumping, no matter how small the amount, could
be held responsible for the entire cleanup cost. EPA has often
called the provision an indispensable tool in its enforcement
efforts.
   The four groups asked to take part were the Environmental
Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra
Club and the National Audubon Society. The fund said it had not
decided whether to participate, key officials at the council and
the society were away from their offices and the club said it did
not expect to participate.
   Sierra Club lobbyist Blake Early said the club would like to
have the study ``redirected to focus on the problems EPA has had in
implementing the law and not whether Congress did the right thing.''
   Linda Fisher, assistant EPA administrator for policy, planning
and evaluation, said: ``No one in this agency would ever give up
joint and several liability. It goes to the core not only of
Superfund, but hazardous waste management in general.''
   She said the Superfund study will examine ``how it's being
implemented, how you can increase state cleanups and how you can
increase private party cleanups.''
   Joining Walsh's group in the request to Thomas were the Clean
Water Action Project, Citizen Action, Environmental Action, the
Environmental Policy Institute, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace
USA, the National Toxics Campaign, Maine Peoples Alliance, the New
Jersey Environmental Federation, the Ohio Public Interest Campaign,
OMB Watch, Public Citizen, the Rainbow Lobby and the Silicon Valley
Toxics Campaign.

   OKEECHOBEE, Fla. (A) _ Streetwise New Yorker Thomas Alpern knows
more about urban sharks than swamp alligators, but that's about to
change as he takes to the waters of Lake Okeechobee on Thursday in
the first statewide gator hunt in 26 years.
   ``This guy doesn't know an airboat from an air hose,'' said
professional gator-hunter Lee Kramer, who will serve as Alpern's
guide. ``I'm here to make sure we get the gators, not vice versa.''
   Beginning at sundown Thursday, the two men will head out onto
the lake as the most unusual and celebrated of the 238 participants
in the gator hunt, which was organized in response to a growing
alligator population estimated at 1 million.
   Former Ivy Leaguer Alpern, 25, acknowledged with a tip of his
Mets' baseball cap that he is enjoying his well-publicized role as
the only Northerner among the hunters.
   ``They all think I'm a bit strange,'' said Alpern, who left his
loft apartment in Brooklyn on Tuesday. ``You know, the city boy out
in the country sort of thing. I'm just taking it all in.''
   He has caught the attention of the major television networks and
nearly every large newspaper in Florida. Last week, New York City
environmental officials gave Alpern a T-shirt decorated with a
sunglasses-wearing alligator climbing out of a city sewer, in jest
of the tales of freed pet alligators roaming beneath the streets.
   ``It's all been an adventure in itself. I never thought I'd be a
newsmaker,'' he said. ``But I like doing odd things, so I guess it
just comes with the territory.''
   Alpern, a free-lance writer and aspiring race-car driver, said
he contacted Florida game officials in May after reading about the
hunt in a magazine. Alpern and Bart McBeth of Sulphur, La., were
the only two out-of-state residents randomly selected from about
5,000 applications to participate in the monthlong season.
   McBeth could not be reached by telephone Wednesday to confirm he
will join the hunt.
   Alpern, who will be allowed to take 15 gators with his permit,
said he selected Kramer, 51, as a guide after learning the danger
in gator hunting.
   ``I've never hunted anything except a bird I shot with a BB gun
as a kid,'' said Alpern, who has practiced on a shooting range,
however, and will take his practice gun with him on the hunt.
   Alpern left Harvard University in 1982 after one year of classes
and is working on a bachelor's degree at Columbia University.
   Between schools, he devoted himself to auto racing. In 1985, the
last time he was in Florida, he crashed his Formula Ford race car
at a track.
   He spent the next year racing in Europe and trying to develop a
new British-Italian Formula 3 car. Later, back in New York, he
began helicopter lessons.
   On Wednesday, he got some ideas of what he can expect to earn on
his adventure into the Everglades.
   On a white legal pad, Kramer rapidly tallied some figures: take
15 gators, subtract money for Alpern's $1,000 out-of-state permit
and $75 each for processing and other expenses, and it leaves about
$4,000 in potential profits from the sale of the carcasses.
   Alpern thought for a moment and proposed an even split. A
handshake consummated the deal.

station, UPDATE with White House comment. Picks up graf 6th `The

   The United States said Wednesday it may suspend or
terminate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty unless the Soviet
Union dismantles a Siberian radar complex.
   A statement from the U.S. delegation to a week-long conference
that reviewed the agreement left no doubt that Washington was
dissatisfied with the Kremlin response to U.S. concerns about the
Krasnoyarsk radar installation.
   The statement said the United States has ``made clear that the
continuing existence of the Krasnoyarsk radar makes it impossible
to conclude any future arms agreements in the START or defense and
space areas.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
would continue efforts for a treaty on limiting long-range nuclear
forces, known as START, but said there was little prospect of doing
so before President Reagan leaves office in January.
   ``We are still meeting in Geneva and still working toward a
START treaty ... in the hope that it (the Soviet radar) will be
dismantled in the interim,'' he said.
   Fitzwater was in Santa Barbara, Calif., with the vacationing
president.
   Negotiations on limiting intercontinental nuclear forces and on
space and defense systems are separate, parallel talks that have
continued in Geneva since March 1985.
   The Soviet Union made no immediate comment but the chief Soviet
delegate, Viktor Karpov, scheduled a news conference for Thursday.
The U.S. team was led by the director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, William Burns.
   The U.S. statement said that during the review conference, the
third of its kind, ``the Soviet Union gave no indication that it
was prepared to correct the violations (of the ABM treaty) without
linking their agreement to do so to unacceptable demands.''
   The statement referred to the Krasnoyarsk radar installation,
which the United States for years has been saying violates the ABM
treaty because of its location and orientation.
   It said the U.S. side also raised the question of two other
radars that the Soviets deployed last year in Gomel, near Kiev.
   The ABM treaty limits each side to deploying one ABM system
comprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles. It also constrains
early warning radars which could, because of their location,
orientation and capability, contribute to an ABM defense.
   The U.S. side charges that the Krasnoyarsk radar is such an
installation.
   ``The Krasnoyarsk violation is very serious, particularly when
it is recognized that the radar constitutes one of a network of
such radars that have the inherent potential for attack assessment
in support of ballistic missile defense,'' the statement said.
   The aim of the ABM treaty is to prevent either side from
creating a nationwide protective network, under the theory that
neither side would launch a nuclear attack if there was a
possibility of devastating retaliation.
   Karpov said in July that the Soviet Union would dismantle the
Krasnoyarsk radar equipment, but not the building housing it, if
the United States agreed to renew its commitment to the ABM treaty
for at least 10 years. But the United States says the entire
installation must be scrapped.
   ``Since the Soviet Union was not prepared to satisfy U.S.
concerns'' during the review conference ``the United States will
have to consider declaring this continuing violation a material
breach of the treaty,'' the statement said.
   An information sheet distributed last week by the U.S. mission
says that according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, if one party charges ``material breach'' it is entitled
to invoke the breach ``as a ground for terminating the treaty or
suspending its operation in whole or in part.''
   Such a move would apparently free the United States to conduct
uninhibited research and deployment of its proposed space-based
missile defense system, known officially as the Strategic Defense
Initiative and popularly called ``Star Wars.''
   The Soviets say some of the research violates the ABM treaty.
They have long said that a limit on the research is a prerequisite
for a START treaty, but the United States has rejected such a
linkage.

   Pennsylvania's auditor general has issued
a summons for U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to seek
information on a 1984 state contract for dump trucks said to be bad
buys.
   The summons, filed in Commonwealth Court, orders Thornburgh, a
former Pennsylvania governor, to testify before Auditor General Don
Bailey.
   A spokesman for Thornburgh, David Runkel, said the summons was
prompted by political motives. Thornburgh is a Republican, Bailey a
Democrat.
   ``It would normally be (Thornburgh's) intent to cooperate with
any legitimate questions having to do with his administration. But
this is absurd ... and Mr. Bailey knows it,'' Runkel said.
   Bailey, who is seeking re-election, raised the contract issue
earlier this month in a statement submitted to the Senate
Judiciairy Committee, which reviewed Thornburgh's nomination to
replace Edwin Meese as attorney general.
   Runkel said the matter has been fully investigated by the FBI,
the state attorney general and the U.S. attorney's office and no
problems have been found.
   A spokesman with the state attorney general's office said the
matter was still under review. James West, acting U.S. attorney in
Harrisburg, said the case is not formally closed but officials are
not actively investigating it.
   The $23 million contract for 428 dump trucks was awarded when
Thornburgh was in his second term as Pennsylvania governor. Bailey
has previously criticized the contract, saying the state paid too
much for underpowered trucks.
   Bailey, in a telephone interview, said efforts to meet with
Thornburgh have been unsuccessful.
   As auditor general, Bailey is authorized to gather information
on state matters under his jurisdiction, such as contracts, but
cannot prosecute if he finds evidence of wrongdoing. Such
information would have to be forwarded to appropriate agencies,
such as the state attorney general.
   However, he can issue summonses to compel testimony in matters
under review.

   Marking the final legal chapter in the
nation's worst space disaster, a federal judge has approved the
settlement of a lawsuit filed by the widow of Challenger astronaut
Michael Smith.
   Jane J. Smith filed a $1.5 billion lawsuit against Morton
Thiokol Inc., maker of the booster rocket blamed for the Jan. 28,
1986, explosion that killed seven astronauts. Terms of the
settlement were kept secret.
   U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. approved the
settlement Tuesday.
   Morton Thiokol and the government reached a $7,735,000
settlement with four astronauts' families, those of Challenger
commander Francis Scobee, Ellison Onizuka, Bruce Jarvis and teacher
Christa McAuliffe.
   Morton Thiokol itself settled claims by relatives of Ronald
McNair and Judy Resnick. The terms of those were kept secret.
   Mrs. Smith now lives with her three children _ Scott, 19,
Alison, 17, and Erin, 11 _ south of Houston, near the Johnson Space
Center.
   ``We've had ups and downs,'' she said. ``They miss their father
terribly, just as I do.''

<HEAD>Mandela Moved To Private Clinic, Possibly Setting Stage For
Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jailed black nationalist
Nelson Mandela has been moved from a hospital to a private clinic
while he recuperates from tuberculosis, the government said
Thursday. The move sets the stage for a possible release from
government custody.
   Mandela, 70, was transferred on Aug. 12 from Pollsmoor Prison,
to nearby Tygerberg Hospital, where he was diagnosed with the
disease.
   Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National Congress, has
been in prison for 26 years.
   He has been making a speedy recovery from his illness, his
doctors have said, and was moved late Wednesday night to the
Constantiaberg Clinic in Cape Town, a spokesman for the prison
service, Danie Immelman, told the independent South African Press
Association.
   ``Nelson Mandela's condition has improved to such an extent that
his further treatment in the Tygerberg Hospital was no longer
necessary,'' Immelman was quoted as saying.
   The spokesman gave no indication of how long would be in the
clinic or what the conditions of his stay would be like.
   The move appears to confirm widespread speculation that Mandela
would be placed in a private clinic and gradually reintroduced to
the South African public before the government decides whether to
release him outright.
   Under this widely accepted scenario, Mandela is expected to have
access to a greater number of visitors and possibly even allowed to
conduct media interviews.
   Mandela's full recuperation is likely to at least several weeks
and after that period, the government can then choose whether to
send him back to prison or grant him freedom.
   President P.W. Botha, in a major speech two weeks ago, said he
was seriously considering releasing Mandela, the country's
best-known black leader.
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led
government. His continued imprisonment has the government in a
difficult bind.
   If Botha releases Mandela, the president risks an enormous white
backlash and the possibility of reactivating militant black
opposition that has been largely suppressed under the 26-month-old
state of emergency.
   If Botha keeps Mandela in prison, there could be widespread
black unrest if the country's preeminent black leader dies in
prison.
   Nationwide municipal elections are set for Oct. 26, further
complicating Botha's dilemma. The government is engaged in a
massive campaign to encourage blacks to vote in municipal township
elections, but it also faces a growing threat from conservative
whites.
   Mandela's release would likely encourage black voters to go to
the polls, but could harm Botha's national party in the separate
white local elections.
   The different race groups vote in separate local elections but
the nation's black majority has no vote in national affairs.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Botha has offered since 1985 to release Mandela if he will
renounce violence. However, Mandela has said that the government's
1960 decision to ban the then-peaceful African National Congress
left him no choice but to fight.
   Mandela has said he will disavow violence only if the ANC is not
longer banned, apartheid is dismantled and blacks are given a voice
in national affairs.

   Parents of students who are chronically
truant could lose custody of their children under a plan being
considered by school and court officials.
   A proposal to have schools report the names of chronic truants
to the courts, who would consider transferring custody to a
grandparent or other relative, quickly drew fire from legal aid
lawyers. Critics said it appeared to be an extreme way to deal with
absenteeism and threatens student confidentiality.
   Probate Judge John Keyes, who met last week with School
Superintendent John Dow Jr. to discuss the proposal, said it could
be undertaken legally. The idea is still in the planning stages,
officials said.
   Keyes said the idea grew out of a conversation he had in July
with Dow about parents who abuse drugs and don't send their
children to school regularly.
   Dow proposed a mechanism of reporting truancy to the courts, and
having a probate judge inquire into the family situation, Keyes
said.
   Keyes said removing a child from parents' custody would require
much more than just showing he or she missed school. There would
have to be other signs of neglect, he said.
   Glenn Knierim, state administrator for probate courts, called
the proposal an ``innovative approach to a serious problem.''
   But lawyers who defend poor people were critical.
   ``You can't assume parent neglect because the child is absent a
lot,'' said Robin Murphy, a lawyer with New Haven Legal Assistance.
``It could be that the child is not in an appropriate educational
program, or other children are picking on him or her in school, or
there may be family problems at home.''
   Shelley Geballe, supervising attorney at Yale Law School's Legal
Services Organization, said New Haven schools have repeatedly cited
federal law prohibiting disclosure of student names when declining
to comment on school problems.
   ``Volunteering student names in the absence of a subpoena from
the court I find ironic, to say the least,'' she said.
   Deputy Superintendent of Schools Rosa Quezada said the school
system will work with lawyers to determine how to pass on
information to the court while maintaining student confidentiality.
   Any new policy would require school board approval, she said.
   The absenteeism rate has remained stable in recent years,
Quezada said, but school officials have been alarmed by figures
showing that 35 percent of the fourth-graders who failed a state
standardized test last year had excessive absenteeism.

<HEAD>Postal Service, Union Sign Pact To Reduce Grievances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service and the National
Association of Letter Carriers signed a ``joint commitment''
Wednesday to cut by half thousands of expensive grievance appeals,
arbitrations and employment discrimination complaints annually.
   The non-binding agreement to improve the labor-management
climate is the first ever signed by the Postal Service with a union
representing its employees.
   According to Postal Service records, 19,543 grievances were
appealed beyond the local level by members of the Letter Carriers
union in the 12 months ending Aug. 1, and 10,766 individual
disputes were taken to arbitration.
   In addition, members of the union filed 2,128 complaints of age,
sex or race discrimination against the Postal Service with the
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
   The two-page accord said a joint employee involvement process by
the Postal Service and the 310,000-member union has improved
labor-management relations over the past five years.
   However, it added that ``tension and antagonism remain at an
intolerable level in many work locations ... and the number of
grievances filed and arbitrations conducted is unacceptable.''
   The accord was worked out after Postmaster General Anthony M.
Frank became the first person ever holding that post to address a
postal union convention when he spoke to the Letter Carriers last
month in Portland, Ore.
   ``These processes ... break down the old `them' and `us'
attitudes and promote a positive spirit of cooperation,'' he said.
``In short they save money for both sides, improve productivity
(and) reduce workplace stress.''
   Postal Service officials said the cooperation agreement does not
alter any terms of a 40-month labor contract signed last summer.

   The U.N. secretary-general could not break a
stalemate in the Iran-Iraq peace talks, but said Wednesday he would
make one last try to arrange a meeting between the two nations
before his departure.
   Meanwhile, Iranian leaders called for volunteers for the front
in the war that has taken up to 1 million lives since it began in
September 1980. A cease-fire took effect Aug. 20 and the peace
talks started five days later.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the secretary-general, continued trying
until late Wednesday night ``to arrange a meeting even at two or
three in the morning'' between the chief diplomats of the two
countries, his spokesman, Francois Giuliani told reporters.
   Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar had no luck and would try again
Thursday morning. He is scheduled to leave for Lisbon in the
afternoon.
   ``The secretary-general is frustrated by the slow progress of
the talks and the inability to reach the necessary compromise,''
Giuliani said earlier.
   In Tehran, Iran's deputy head of the military General Command in
charge of manpower called for continuing mobilization and said
Iranians at the front must extend their period of service.
   Alireza Afshar, the deputy, was quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying Iranians have been ordered to remain
on alert ``in order to foil the enemies' plots.'' The report was
monitored in Nicosia.
   On Tuesday, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told his nation, ``We
must take it that we are still at war.''
   Giuliani said said Perez de Cuellar had been ``putting forward
new formulations constantly'' to overcome the difficulties.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi
counterpart Tariq Aziz have not met face-to-face since Friday. The
talks have been conducted since then on lower levels as the U.N.
chief sought a compromise to bridge differences over the
Shatt-Al-Arab waterway and other issues.
   Iran's news agency also quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying
Iran would not submit to any blackmail by Iraq during the peace
talks. He reiterated that Iran would not accede to Iraq's demand
for sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms part
of the southern border between the two nations.
   The agency quoted Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani as
calling the slow pace of thetalks ``unsatisfactory'' and accusing
Iraq of procrastination. It gave few details of his remarks.
   ``What we have all to keep in mind is that time is running out
and I have other commitments,'' Perez de Cuellar said as he entered
the U.N. office early Wednesday. ``I hope that today we will make
some significant progress _ I hope.''
   The U.N. chief is to leave Thursday for Portugal, then go to The
Hague on Monday. It was not certain whether he would return between
appointments, but Giuliani said he would return if necessary.
   Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar hoped to name a special
representative on Thursday to conduct the talks in his absence.
   ``As an honest broker, I have to go from one side to another
proposing ideas and new formulas which could be a real compromise,
not necessarily 100 percent concessions, but a real compromise by
both sides,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said no concrete proposals have been made regarding
troop withdrawals and Shatt-al-Arab _ Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   They said the U.N. effort is directed at arranging the beginning
of troop withdrawals from the front and keeping the question of
sovereignty over Shatt-al-Arab from impeding progress on other
issues.
   Iraq wants to control the entire waterway, while Iran insists
that it be divided, as specified in a 1975 treaty. Iraq has
repudiated that treaty.
   Velayati said Tuesday his government never would make
concessions to Iraq, and both sides accused each other of blocking
progress.
   Perez de Cuellar said Tuesday, ``We are trying to clear the
first part ... on an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal without
delay and ... the cease-fire at sea is part of the problem.''
   Both Iran and Iraq have attacked shipping in the Persian Gulf
during the war.
   Aziz said Monday that the talks were at ``square one'' and there
had been no substantive discussion of what the cease-fire covered.
   On Tuesday, Velayati said Iraq was ``raising a lot of
preconditions,'' including clearing the waterway, which is choked
with silt and sunken ships. But he said there was no deadlock.
   Both Velayati and Aziz said they would remain in Geneva as long
as necessary.

<HEAD>House Of Commons Approves Free-Trade Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's allies in the
House of Commons approved free-trade legislation Wednesday to
eliminate economic barriers with United States.
   But members of the opposition-dominated Senate say they will
stall the bill.
   With both sides waving Canadian flags and the opposition singing
the national anthem, the Commons voted 177-64 for the agreement
signed in January by Mulroney and President Reagan.
   The Progressive Conservatives, with 207 of the 282 seats in the
Commons, easily out-voted the combined opposition and sent the bill
to the Senate.
   The Liberals and New Democrats, who call the trade deal a
sellout of Canadian sovereignty, interrupted the final vote by
singing ``O Canada.''
   During two raucous votes on opposition amendments, Speaker John
Fraser admonished members of Parliament to settle down and asked
New Democrats and Conservatives alike to put down their Canadian
flags and pins.
   But the bill, which would amend 27 federal statutes to make
Canada's border more open to American goods and services, faces a
rough road ahead.
   Mulroney has suggested strongly that he will call a federal
election this fall before the scheduled Jan. 1 launch of the trade
treaty.
   And the Liberal majority in the Senate has promised to stall the
legislation until the issue is decided one way or another in an
election.
   U.S. legislation on the treaty has been approved by the U.S.
House of Representatives and is expected to pass the Senate later
this month.
   Gordon Ritchie, Canada's deputy chief trade negotiator over the
two years of talks with the United States, said the agreement will
not be in effect until the deal gets through the Canadian Senate
and the prime minister actually exchanges a letter of ratification
with the United States president.
   ``We're saving the champagne for the ratification,'' said
Ritchie.
   Public opinion surveys indicate Canadians are almost equally
divided on the merits of the agreement but generally agree on thing
_ the issue is confusing.
   Under the trade agreement, both countries would begin phasing
out border taxes, quotas, standards and other regulations that stop
or discourge trade.
   Future disputes could be referred to five-member panels of trade
experts from both countries for settlement.
   The Canadian government has touted the deal as a boon for
business and jobs as well as cutting the $2 billion a year in
tariffs that Canadian businesses and consumers have to pay on
imports from the United States.
   The opposition says other Canadian jobs will be lost as U.S.
business moves into the Canadian market. Consumers will only see a
fraction of the value of the tariff cuts, they say.
   The agreement was reached last fall after 18 months of talks
between the two nations.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Symphony's Cancellation of Vanessa Redgrave Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Symphony Orchestra did not violate the
civil rights of actress Vanessa Redgrave when it canceled her
performances following threats by protesters, a federal appeals
court ruled Wednesday.
   The full U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals ruled by a 3-2 vote
that the cancellation did not violate the Massachusetts Civil
Rights Act. It was an unusual reversal of an earlier finding by a
three-member panel of the appellate court.
   Wednesday's decision reinstated an award to compensate Ms.
Redgrave $12,000 she would have earned in a Broadway role she lost
during the suit against the symphony. However, expenses the actress
would have incurred while appearing in the play will be subtracted
from the award.
   Orchestra attorney Bob Sullivan said symphony officials were
relieved with the ruling.
   ``I think they're also happy that the case is probably over now
and they can go back to doing what they're best at _ making
music,'' he said.
   Attorneys for Ms. Redgrave, Daniel J. Kornstein and Marvin
Wexler of New York, were not in their offices and did not return
calls Wednesday evening.
   Ms. Redgrave was hired by the symphony in 1982 to narrate six
performances of Stravinsky's ``Oedipus Rex'' at Boston, Tanglewood
in western Massachusetts and New York's Carnegie Hall.
   But the contract was canceled after the symphony received
letters and telephone calls indicating there would be picketing and
other protests because of Ms. Redgrave's support of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   In November 1984, a federal jury ruled the symphony had breached
its contract with Ms. Redgrave and awarded her the $27,500 she was
to have received for the performances plus $100,000 in compensatory
damages for work the actress said she lost because of the action.
   In February 1985, U.S. District Judge Robert Keeton threw out
the $100,000 award and ruled the symphony had not violated her
civil rights.
   Last October, a three-member panel of the U.S. 1st Circuit Court
of Appeals restored $12,000 of that award as compensation for the
lost role. The three-member panel also found the Massachusetts
Civil Rights Act had been violated.
   Attorneys for the symphony, arguing that Massachusetts law
allowed them to cancel performances because of concerns that
threatened disruptions would mar the artistic integrity of the
performances, asked for a rehearing before the full court.
   Wednesday's ruling by the full court, effectively reversing the
earlier finding, was unusual, Sullivan said.
   ``This is a very, very rare thing,'' he said. ``The 1st Circuit
very seldom reverses themselves.''

<HEAD>Sunshine, Dry Air Makes For A Pleasant Day</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Plenty of sunshine made it a wonderful day across most of the
country Wednesday, with temperatures in the 80s in the southern and
central United States and in the 60s and 70s in the north.
   A high pressure system centered over northern Ohio-Pennsylvania
border brought clear skies and dry air to an area stretching from
New England into the southern Plains.
   Another high pressure system over southwest British Columbia
provided a pleasant day in the Northwest, with afternoon
temperatures in the 60s and 70s.
   Gusty winds developed in the northern Plains, blowing from 20 to
35 mph across parts of Kansas and Nebraska.
   Rainfall was restricted to southern coastal areas along the
Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, with showers and thunderstorms
scattered across Florida and westward along the Gulf coast as far
as southernmost Texas. There also were scattered showers in
east-central Arizona and west-central New Mexico.
   In the desert Southwest, it was anothger scorching day, with the
mercury rising over 100 in parts of Southern California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 106 degrees at Palm Springs,
Calif. The nation's low early Wednesday was 35 degrees at Butte,
Mont.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms
scattered from the southern Atlantic states and Florida across the
Gulf coast into the Texas Panhandle and over the central and
southern Plains. Showers and thunderstorms were expected to develop
along a cold front over Michigan's Upper Peninsula and northwest
Wisconsin. The rest of the nation can expect mostly sunny skies.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 80s or 90s across
much of the nation, but in the 70s over the northern Great Lakes
and the upper Ohio Valley into New England and between 100 and 110
degrees from south-central Oregon through the valleys of California
into the desert Southwest.

   Some of the passengers who survived the
crash of a Delta Airlines jet on Wednesday may owe their lives to
another crash three years ago, rescuers said.
   ``Last time we didn't know what to expect. This time we're a
little more organized,'' said Ray Cartier, a Red Cross volunteer.
   ``Last time'' was the crash of Delta Flight 191, a Lockheed
L-1011, on the other side of Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport three years ago in which 137 people died.
   ``Flight 191 definitely gave us more experience,'' said Mike
Sympson, paramedic supervisor for the airport police and fire
department. ``When we got here, it was click, click, click.''
   ``There was a lot of preparation done because of the last one,''
said Michael Muncy, a lab technician at the 314-bed Harris
Methodist H.E.B. Hospital, where many of the injured were taken.
``Everyone was right in place. There was no wasted motion. We knew
just what to do.''
   Sympson arrived aboard one of the first three emergency vehicles
at the crash scene just three minutes after the 9:03 a.m. accident
at the airport's west end.
   Dozens of fire trucks, helicopters and police vehicles converged
on the prairie southwest of the main airport tower, and within 10
minutes some of the first victims were being transported to
hospitals, Sympson said.
   ``When we got to the plane, the majority of the survivors were
on the grass, away from the plane,'' Sympson said.
   A van driver, Eusebio Padilla, said he was several hundred yards
away when the plane cracked open and a column of flame erupted from
the tail area.
   Sympson and others in the first wave of rescuers concentrated on
establishing a triage area where survivors could be evaluated and
the most seriously injured expedited to hospitals.
   The paramedics said all they were told only that the plane was a
Boeing 727. It wasn't until thick, black smoke cleared 15 or 20
minutes later that they discovered they were working on another
Delta plane.
   When paramedic Jim Hartman arrived on the scene, ``all I heard
was screaming from the people on the ground.''
   ``Some of them (the survivors) were in severe shock, but some of
them were joking, trying to I guess make the situation easier,''
Hartman said. ``One guy laughed and said, `Boy, I'm not going to
take an airplane home.' Can't really blame him at that point.''
   Brian McKinney, an airport Department of Public Safety officer,
was off duty when he heard about the crash on the news and came in
to work about 9:40 a.m.
   ``I just helped pull bodies out _ about nine,'' said McKinney.
``They were charred. Some of them were in seats. Some of them
weren't in seats. Some had belts on we had to take off.
   ``The ones that I pulled out were in the back of the plane,'' he
said.
   Sympson said this crash was similar to the one three years ago.
   ``There was not a big difference,'' Sympson said. ``There was
fire, smoke and you didn't know what you were going to find. I'm
simply amazed there were this many survivors.''
   Paramedic Robert Seadore said he was the first paramedic to
arrive at both crashes. ``I tell you I had some flashbacks,''
Seadore said of Wednesday's disaster.
   One result of the 1985 crash was a greater emphasis on helping
rescuers cope with what they saw and had to do when they arrived to
help Wednesday.
   McKinney, still wearing his silver flame-proof coveralls and
hard hat, said those who helped pull victims from the plane were
sent to a stress center where they received tetanus shots. Then
they were taken to a stress clinic for counseling.
   ``Anyone who pulled out bodies went through that,'' he said.
``You never get used to it. But you got a job to do, and you just
go ahead and do it.''
   Hundreds of people were on hand at the crash site within an hour
after the accident. Within two hours, volunteers from charitable
agencies had arrived to provide food and beverages to workers in
what was expected to be a day-long effort.
   ``We work with relatives and victims, ensuring they've got
nurses, preachers to talk to, and we meet their transportation
needs by taking them to the hospitals and hotels,'' Cartier said.

   An IRA bomb exploded by mistake
Wednesday in an apartment where a booby trap had been set for
British soldiers, killing an elderly man and a woman.
   The IRA apologized for the trap that went ``tragically wrong.''
The IRA has killed 20 civilians unintentionally since November and
has apologized repeatedly.
   Also Wednesday, police said three men killed in a British army
ambush Tuesday were armed IRA terrorists armed and dressed for a
possible attack.
   The ambush was seen as the start of a British crackdown on the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, which wants to unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic under socialist rule.
   On Wednesday night, gangs of youths in Catholic enclaves of
Belfast hijacked 30 vehicles and set several on fire, said a police
spokesman.
   Meanwhile, the Republic of Ireland called for an urgent meeting
with British officials under terms of the 1985 Anglo-Irish
Agreement, which gives the republic a consultative role in the
affairs of Northern Ireland.
   ``The frightening escalation of violence undermines the very
maintenance of the rule of law, and can only bring further
divisions and tragedy for the people of the north,'' said a
statement by Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey and his Cabinet.
   West German police captured two heavily armed suspected IRA
guerrillas heading toward a British Army barracks shortly after
midnight Tuesday after they drove through a remote border crossing
from the Netherlands.
   The apartment bomb in Londonderry, about 60 miles northwest of
Belfast, was triggered by an elderly man who climbed through a
window, worried that the young man living there had not been seen
for several days, police said.
   The blast demolished the apartment, killing an elderly man and a
woman standing outside and injuring another man, said spokesman
Sgt. Winston Winters.
   An IRA statement and the police account indicated the IRA
abducted the apartment's occupants several days ago and planted the
booby trap, hoping an army search party would enter the apartment
and trigger the explosives.
   The IRA's Londonderry unit apologized in a statement circulated
to the news media.
   ``Although the operation was carefully planned, it went
tragically wrong,'' it said. ``At no stage, unfortunately, was it
anticipated that a member of the public would enter the flat
through a front window and open a booby-trapped door.''
   This summer, the IRA has escalated its war to drive the British
from the province, killing 27 British military men in attacks in
Northern Ireland, elsewhere in Britain and in continental Europe.
   The three killed Tuesday were attacked while on a country road
at Drumnakilly, County Tyrone, eight miles from Ballygawley, where
an IRA bomb on Aug. 20 killed eight soldiers in a bus.
   It was that attack, the bloodiest this year, that prompted a
British government pledge to crack down on the IRA.
   The IRA said the three were members on ``active service,'' the
IRA term for a guerrilla mission.
   The British news media speculated that the Special Air Services,
the country's best-trained anti-guerrilla squad, ambushed the men.
They quoted witnesses as saying they saw men in civilian clothes
being ferried away by military helicopter immediately after the
shooting.
   Police said the three wore the typical IRA outfit of overalls,
gloves and ski masks and that two rifles and a handgun were found
in their bullet-riddled car.
   British press reports said the three were preparing to
assassinate a soldier of the locally recruited Ulster Defense
Regiment, but the police and army refused comment.
   Britain never confirms involvement by the Special Air Services,
but several IRA deaths in recent years have been attributed to the
clandestine unit. They include three unarmed IRA members shot March
6 in Gibraltar, where they allegedly planned a car-bomb attack. The
IRA has lost 11 members this year.
   The province's police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said
Brian Mullen and brothers Gerard and Martin Harte were hardened IRA
operatives who were often arrested but never charged.
   It said Gerard Harte commanded the IRA's mid-Tyrone unit and was
``a ruthless, dedicated terrorist'' who from 1983 organized
``terrorist operations mainly against members of the security
forces in the mid-Tyrone area.''
   His brother, Martin, ``played a prominent role in terrorist
operations,'' while Mullen was active in the Omagh area, the
statement said.
   British news reports said Mullen was Martin Harte's
brother-in-law and one of eight men detained after the bus bombing.
The eight were questioned for five days and released.
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the moderate Catholic Social
Democratic and Labor Party, said the three died in ``controversial
circumstances.'' Mallon, a member of Parliament, said Britain would
have to say whether troops made any attempt to arrest them.
   The Protestant Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the militant
Democratic Unionist Party, said he was glad security forces were
``going on the offensive.''
   The two suspected IRA guerrillas arrested in West Germany had
driven over the Dutch border into the northwestern part of West
Germany by using a remote country lane off limits to traffic
between the two countries, police said.

   Former Mayor Mike Roark, battling to
save his law license after pleading guilty to drug charges,
admitted to a Bar panel Wednesday that he took no action while
prosecutor against two men who sold him drugs.
   Roark, who turned 43 on Wednesday, testified for about 25
minutes before a subcommittee of the state Bar's Legal Ethics
Committee. It is considering whether sanctions should be imposed,
up to revocation of Roark's law license, because of his guilty
pleas.
   Roark pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor federal charges of
possession of cocaine and resigned as mayor as part of the plea
agreement. He was released from federal prison on July 20 after
serving 5{ months.
   Ethics panel chairman Arthur Recht said the central issue at the
hearing is whether a public official should be treated differently
in a disciplinary matter from lawyers in private practice.
   Roark's side said he should not and asked for leniency.
   But Bar disciplinary counsel Jack Marden argued that Roark used
his position to shield those supplying drugs.
   Under cross-examination, Marden asked Roark, who admitted using
drugs while Kanawha County prosecutor, whether he tried to bring
charges against two men who supplied drugs to him and were
convicted by federal prosecutors.
   ``I took no steps to prosecute either or advise anybody,'' Roark
said.
   Kanawha County Prosecutor Charlie King and Peter Brown, both top
assistants to Roark when he was prosecutor, said Roark showed no
leniency toward drug dealers. But King said he could not recall
Roark participating in any drug prosecutions.
   The state Bar rested its case against Roark without calling a
witness.
   On the stand, Roark took full blame for his actions and said he
was sorry for what had happened.
   ``I have no excuses and I offer none,'' said Roark, who has been
practicing law since his release from prison. ``I obviously knew
what I was doing was wrong at the time I was doing it.''
   But Roark said he believes that he has paid and pays daily for
his actions. He asked the panel to allow him to maintain his law
license so he can make restitution to the community for his
misbehavior.
   Recht said the panel should render a decision sometime in
October. Its recommendation goes to the full Legal Ethics
Committee, which makes its final report to the state Supreme Court.
The court can then agree to the recommendation, modify or reject it.
   Former Charleston Police Chief Jack Buckalew, called on behalf
of the Roark, testified Wednesday that Roark never attempted to
interfere with his agency.
   Buckalew said his drug officers generally worked under federal
supervision and he had little control over them anyway. But he did
say that in 1985 he was aware that Roark was being investigated
concerning drug matters.
   ``Did Roark try to curtail drug enforcement?'' asked James
McIntyre, Roark's attorney.
   ``No, he did not,'' replied Buckalew, police chief from 1983 to
1985.
   On cross-examination, Marden asked Buckalew whether Roark had
ever lied to him.
   ``Yes, he did,'' Buckalew said. ``He was not truthful as to his
plea of guilty to cocaine use. He indicated to me he was not using
it.''

   Plans for the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library hit a snag Wednesday when questions were raised at an
environmental hearing about the project's effects on air quality,
plant life and traffic congestion.
   The Ventura County Environmental Report Review recessed the
hearing for a week to get more information. At next week's meeting,
the committee could either approve the library project, delay a
decision again or decide that an Environmental Impact Report is
needed.
   The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation wants to build the
library on a 100-acre site which lies partly within a greenbelt
area that is protected from large-scale development by a
decade-old, non-binding agreement among the communities of
Moorpark, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks.
   The library, scheduled for completion in 1991, would house
President Reagan's White House papers and would contain museum
exhibits about his administration. Like the eight existing
presidential libraries, it would be built with private funds and
then operated by the National Archives.
   Chuck Thomas, who represents the county Air Pollution Control
District on the seven-member committee, asked for the delay, saying
the district had found the project inconsistent with county air
quality standards.
   ``It would bring in a lot of additional traffic that is not
projected,'' Thomas said.
   The foundation estimates that the library would attract 350,000
visitors a year.
   The Environmental Coalition, a private environmental group in
Ventura County, said, however, it believed the number of visitors
per year could exceed 425,000.
   ``I think I would have to come down against it'' if the matter
were voted on without further investigation, Thomas told the
committee.
   Other members of the committee said they needed more information
on traffic density and the effect on vegetation before making a
decision.
   Fred Worthley, regional manager of the California Department of
Fish and Game, wrote to county officials on May 12 that an
undisclosed number of specimens of three ``sensitive plant
species'' would be harmed or destroyed by construction. He
suggested a detailed site survey ``at the appropriate time of year
when these plants can be readily identified and that the project be
redesigned to avoid these areas as much as possible.''
   Philip E. Gatch, director of planning and community development
for Thousand Oaks, said in a letter written Tuesday that part of
the public road over which traffic would travel to reach the
library site ``remains a two-lane roadway operating at a level of
service beyond its current capacity.''
   Others at the hearing said they understood this section was to
be widened before the scheduled 1991 opening of the library.
   If the project is approved by the committee, critics would have
10 days in which to appeal. The committee would hear the appeal in
another 30 days.
   If an Environmental Impact Report is required, it could take a
year or more.
   The foundation, which hopes to break ground for the library this
fall, would have the right to appeal any decision to order an
Environmental Impact Report.

   Top aides to Michael Dukakis denied Wednesday that
they told Jesse Jackson not to campaign in several states as
tension between the two Democrats increased.
   Sources close to Jackson said the former presidential candidate
was angered at being told to avoid campaigning in Michigan,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, New York and Alabama.
   The sources said Dukakis officials had determined Jackson could
hurt the ticket among traditionally Democratic blue collar voters
in some states who supported Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984.
   ``I am aware of no list of states provided to him, of states he
should not or would not or we prefer he not go into,'' said Dukakis
campaign manager Susan Estrich.
   But one aide to the Democratic nominee, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the campaign conducted polling in every state for
favorable and unfavorable opinions on Jackson ``to see how well he
can do in the fall in attracting swing voters as well as blacks.''
   The results found that in some of the primary states he won,
Jackson had high negatives among those swing voters.
   Dukakis is making a strong bid to woo those so-called Reagan
Democrats back to their former allegiance to Democratic
presidential candidates.
   In Nashville, Tennessee State Rep. Roscoe Dixon of Memphis said
Jackson has invited him and other key supporters to a meeting
Thursday in Atlanta. He said he did not know how many people have
been invited.
   U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., an Atlanta congressman and former
Jackson supporter who now co-chairs Dukakis' Georgia campaign, said
Wednesday night he intended to attend the Thursday meeting, which
he understood was called to discuss voter registration and
get-out-the-vote efforts in the South.
   Although Lewis said he did not expect a discussion on tension
between Jackson and Dukakis supporters, Dixon said he planned to
bring it up.
   ``We don't feel that we have been totally involved in the
Dukakis campaign...,'' Dixon said. ``The first thing I'm going to
do is get with Reverend Jackson in Atlanta on Thursday and find out
his thinking on the matter.''
   Jackson met with Dukakis aides in Washington last week and was
reported as angered by the suggestion he stay out of several
states. According to one participant in the discussions, who asked
not to be identified, the request was withdrawn.
   Jackson agreed he would stay out of Texas, but will campaign in
the other states. The former civil rights activist won the
Democratic contests in Michigan, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi
and finished ahead of Dukakis in Georgia.
   Jack Corrigan, a Dukakis campaign aide who participated in that
meeting, said no suggestion was made that he stay out of those
states.
   ``States were discussed,'' said Corrigan, but he denied it was
in the context of places where Jackson could hurt the ticket.
   Estrich said Dukakis staff were working with Jackson aides to
``establish a schedule, how best to use his limited time.''
   Dukakis aide Donna Brazile, who was not in the Thursday meeting
but works on minority outreach for Dukakis, said the Dukakis forces
have been scrupulous in contacting Jackson officials in every state.
   ``In many ways our relationship and treatment of Reverend
Jackson translates into black enthusiasm ... On the other hand, we
have to have a local strategy that involves the black community,''
she said.
   Dukakis and Jackson made a pact at the Democratic convention in
Atlanta in July that essentially was designed to give the Jackson
constituency and its issues a voice in the Democratic general
election campaign, including transferring some of Jackson's aides
and advisers to Dukakis.
   Brazile acknowledged that only two Jackson aides have been
incorprated into the Dukakis national staff, but said that on the
state and local level many former Jackson officials have been
brought into the Dukakis campaign.

   Three years after a Delta Air Lines jet crashed on
takeoff in a severe thunderstorm at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, a federal court battle continues over responsibility for
the accident.
   On Aug. 2, 1985, Delta Flight 191 crashed and burned, killing
137 people and injuring 25 others.
   In Wednesday's crash of Flight 1141 on takeoff in cloudless
skies for Salt Lake City, 13 people were killed and 94 survived.
The plane went down at the opposite end of the airport from the
1985 crash.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators ruled in July
1986 that the Delta 191 crash occurred when the L-1101 flew into a
microburst containing several wind shears. The strong, abrupt
downward shifts in wind direction at the south end of the airport
smashed the jet into the ground.
   Lawyers for Delta and the government are continuing a
6-month-old federal trial in Fort Worth to determine
responsibility. Earlier this month, testimony was postponed until
October while a federal judge tries to clear other cases.
   Delta, which initially admitted some responsibility for the
crash, claims government air traffic controllers and weather
forecasters failed to warn the flight crew of the storm.
   The trial involving Delta, its insurers and the widow of the
pilot is the first in which a major U.S. airline has gone to court
against the government to seek damages.
   Delta officials claim the government should bear responsibility
for the crash and pay all or part of more than $90 million in
death, injury and damage claims the airline already has paid.
   More than 90 lawsuits seeking more than $200 million dollars
were filed by victims' relatives.
   Lawyers for the government contend the flight crew should have
been able to avoid the crash.
   The NTSB faulted crew training for handling wind shears and the
lack of ``definitive'' weather information as contributing factors
in the accident.
   But the Atlanta-based airline maintains the board's findings
were ``incomplete, inaccurate and most painfully flawed.''
Officials said the crew operated the craft in accordance with
Federal Aviation Administration procedures and regulations.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa called on
Poland's striking workers Wednesday night to settle their local
grievances and end the country's worst labor unrest in seven years.
   Walesa made the appeal hours after meeting with government
leaders on the wave of strikes that began Aug. 16 calling for
higher wages and the legalization of Solidarity.
   He said the national issues of guaranteeing trade union
pluralism and legalizing his outlawed trade federation would be
taken up in round-table discussions promised by the government in
the near future, according to a statement read by an aide, Piotr
Konopka.
   Walesa said he raised the importance of Solidarity in his
three-hour meeting with Poland's interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak _ his first with government leaders in six years.
   ``The participants in the discussion recognize that all affairs
related to trade union movement would be discussed by the
round-table,'' Walesa said.
   ``I propose therefore that we suspend the current strikes. I
accepted further talks with central authorities and turn to the
strike committes for the actual ending of the negotiation of other
postulates and the suspension of the strikes,'' Walesa's statement
said.
   After giving the Walesa statement, Konopka added: ``I hope that
it will appear as a historical day.''
   Konopka said Walesa conferred with strikers at the idled Lenin
shipyard, where the Solidarity leader still works as an
electrician, and the strike there could end very soon. Strikes are
in effect at nine other worksites across the country.
   Solidarity spokesman Piotr Niemczyk said later in Warsaw that
all strike committees had been informed of Walesa's statement.
   However, strike committee members in Szczecin said they will not
automatically stop the strike as long their demands concerning
local issues are not met, Niemczyk said. The committee proposed
talks with management but has so far received no reply, he said.
   Walesa went to the Roman Catholic episcopate in Warsaw where he
conferred with advisers and church officials for two hours after
his talks with Kiszczak. In Roman Catholic Poland, the church is a
power rivaling the government.
   Afterward, he said: ``I am an optimist.''
   He then stepped into a car that took him and Solidarity adviser
Tadeusz Mazowiecki from the capital to the Gdansk shipyard where
Walesa founded the union in the labor turmoil of 1980.
   In Washington, the State Department called the meeting a
``welcome and significant step forward.'' It expressed hope the
communist authorities are prepared to work with Walesa and other
leaders ``widely admired and trusted by the Polish people.''
   Meetings between Walesa and ranking Polish officials last
occurred during his internment in 1982. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's
government imposed martial law in December 1981 to suppress
Solidarity, the first free union in the Soviet bloc, and outlawed
it in 1982.
   The current round of labor trouble began two weeks ago and at
one point idled 20 plants and mines employing 100,000 people.
   The meeting with Kiszczak took place on the anniversary of the
Gdansk agreements of Aug. 31, 1980, in which the government
recognized the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity.
Poland's current labor unrest is the worst since that summer.
   Attending the meeting in a Warsaw villa, a location kept secret
until the talks ended, were Walesa, Kiszczak, Bishop Jerzy
Dabrowski of Warsaw and Stanislaw Ciosek, an official of the
national unity organization PRON.
   PAP, the official news agency, carried only a brief report. It
listed the participants and said they discussed ``the premises for
organizing a `round-table' meeting and the procedure of holding
it.''
   A statement from the episcopate that was approved by all
involved said Walesa raised the issue of union pluralism and the
role of Solidarity.
   ``The partners (in the discussion) stated that all problems
connected with union movement will be discussed at the round
table,'' it said. ``There are no taboo subjects.''
   Kiszczak proposed on Friday that officials hold a round-table
meeting with worker representatives to discuss labor grievances,
and the Communist Party's ruling Politburo endorsed it Tuesday.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said Tuesday such a meeting
could be held as soon as the strikes ended.
   Andrzej Stelmachowski, a lawyer and senior adviser of
Solidarity, said Walesa agreed to the idea of round-table talks,
but only if the agenda included a discussion of the trade
federation's future.
   He said Wednesday's meeting represented the beginning of a
process to resolve Poland's political and economic problems. He did
not exclude the possibility of further preparatory talks before a
round-table meeting.
   Trade unions, the right to form associations and the role of
other groups in the government's reform program are core issues for
discussion, said Stelmachowski, who is president of the Warsaw Club
of Catholic Intelligentsia and a specialist in constitutional law.
   ``The procedure and shape of Solidarity-related union
organizations must be the subject of patient negotiations, which
have to take a certain time,'' he said.
   In addition to Walesa, Kiszczak met with six other political
figures Wednesday. They included Jan Dobraczynski, the head of
PRON, and Henryk Sienkiewicz, the Solidarity leader in Silesia. PAP
identified Sienkiewicz only as an engineer.

   The U.S. Air Force released the
names Wednesday of an American killed in the Ramstein air show
disaster and seven still being treated at a U.S. Army hospital in
West Germany.
   The Air Force statement identified the dead American as Army
Pfc. Genevieve Riggs, 36, of the 110th Military Police Company in
Pirmasens, West Germany.
   Her husband, Sgt. Myron Riggs, also of the 110th, was one of
four people evacuated to the Brooke Army Medical Center in San
Antonio, Texas, on Tuesday for burn treatment, the Air Force said.
   ``Private Riggs is also survived by her father, Ernest W.
Hendricks, of Kearneysville, W. Va.,'' the Air Force statement said.
   The Pentagon has said six Americans died but no identities had
been released. Dozens of people were killed and scores injured
Sunday when three Italian jets collided during the air show at the
U.S. Air Base at Ramstein and one crashed in flames.
   On the list of Americans being treated at the U.S. Army's
Landstuhl hospital near Ramstein, with their conditions, were:
   _Sonya Fuller, 25, of Cheyenne, Wyo., wife of Airman Jeff Fuller
of the 66th Security Police Squadron at Sembach Air Force Base,
West Germany. Fair.
   _William Granflor, 9, son of Sgt. Guillermo Granflor of San
Gabriel, Calif., assigned to the 86th Component Repair Squadron at
Ramstein air base. Stable.
   _Sgt. Karl Heilig, 31, of San Antonio, Texas, assigned to the
86th Equipment Maintenance Squadron at Ramstein. Good.
   _Lisa A. Newton, 18, daughter of Sgt. Leon Newton of the U.S.
Army's 32nd Support Command at Worms, West Germany, no hometown
given for either. Good.
   _Roberta Nicks, 26, of Pittsburgh, Pa., wife of Army Sgt. Lonzo
Nicks, assigned to the 11th Signal Battalion, Kleber Kaserne,
Kaiserslautern, West Germany. Good.
   _David Olson, 21, son of Maj. Steven Olson of Marinette, Wis.,
assigned to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing at Ramstein. Good.
   _Army Sgt. Alexander Tirona, 27, of Cavite, Philippines (no U.S.
address given), assigned to the 44th Signal Battalion, Kleber
Kaserne, Kaiserslautern, West Germany. Good.
   Air Force and Army officials said seven Americans who had been
hospitalized at Landstuhl were evacuated to the Brooke hospital in
San Antonio:
   _Army Sgt. Myron Riggs, 24, husband of Genevieve Riggs, no
hometown or condition given.
   _Air Force Master Sgt. Stephen Hull, 32, no hometown or
condition.
   _Army 1st Lt. Kim Strader, 30, no hometown or condition.
   _Anderea Delarosa, identified by Landstuhl officials only as a
``dependent of an American serviceman,'' no hometown or condition.
   _Air Force Sgt. Jeffrey L. McCanch, 23; his wife Tammy, 21, and
their son Jeffrey Jr., 2.
   An Air Force statement said of the McCanches: ``The child is
listed with very serious injuries. His parents are both listed in
good condition.'' It also said Sgt. McCanch graduated from high
school in Saxonburg, Pa., and entered the Air Force in Pittsburgh.

   Florida's Lotto jackpot increased
Wednesday to a world's record $52 million as ticket sales continued
booming.
   Sales for this week's prize were up 36 percent over Wednesday
afternoon sales last week, so officials increased the prize from
$50 million to $52 million, said Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   ``Our sales are going into orbit,'' Mrs. Paul said.
   California gave away $51.4 million in June, 21 months after
starting its computerized numbers game. Florida's Lotto began four
months ago.
   ``We have experienced unprecedented growth for a lottery state
this young,'' Mrs. Paul said.
   The $52 million jackpot is a world record, according to Terri La
Fleur, a senior editor with Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine,
a monthly trade publication based in New York City.
   The jackpot includes three weekly grand prizes, because no one
has correctly guessed the six winning numbers drawn each Saturday
night since Aug. 6. Last week's jackpot had grown to $32 million.
   Lottery officials are assuming that at least 40 million tickets
will be sold this week, to support the increase of the prize to $52
million.
   Some 32 million $1 tickets were sold last week, Mrs. Paul said.
   This week's sales of 7.8 million tickets by Wednesday afternoon
were up 36 percent over last week's sales, Mrs. Paul said. The bulk
of the sales are usually at the end of the week.
   ``The $50 million jackpot has really brought a lot of people
in,'' said Gary Harper, assistant manager of a Jiffy Store that
sell lottery tickets in Ponte Vedra Beach. ``Saturday is going to
be our big day.''

   A Jewish settler whose car was hit by a
firebomb accidentally shot and wounded two Israeli soldiers because
``he thought they were terrorists coming to kill him,'' a settler
spokesman said.
   In other violence, two Palestinians were killed in clashes with
troops, doctors and news reports said.
   A third Palestinian died of wounds suffered Tuesday. The three
fatalities, of Arabs aged 16 to 22, brought to 258 the number of
Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis
have died during the same period.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir meanwhile called for changing
Israeli policy to permit civilians and soldiers to open fire on
Arab stone-throwers without shooting warning rounds first, an aide
said.
   Shamir said he believes rocks should be ``reclassified as lethal
weapons, against which one should defend oneself in the same way as
against firebombs and gunfire,'' said aide Yossi Ahimeir.
   ``A stone must be considered a weapon that can end your life,''
Ahimeir quoted Shamir as saying.
   Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, has faced criticism
from many of the 68,000 Jewish settlers who live in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip along with 1.5 million Palestinians.
   Settlers have been angered by police confiscation of weapons
after civilian shooting incidents in the occupied territories.
   Meanwhile, an army spokesman said an Israeli civilian chasing a
firebomb thrower near the Jewish West Bank settlement of Efrat
opened fire and accidentally wounded two Israeli soldiers.
   The soldiers also were pursuing the suspect when they were shot,
the spokesman said without elaborating. The spokesman said one
soldier suffered moderate wounds, and the other was slightly hurt.
   Israel radio said the civilian, a resident of the nearby Tekoa
settlement, was detained for questioning.
   David Bedine, a spokesman for Jewish settlements in the area,
said a firebomb hit the settler's car and exploded, causing minor
damage.
   The settler got out of his car and opened fire when ``he saw two
images holding guns running toward him,'' said Bedine. ``He thought
they were terrorists coming to kill him.''
   The two were soldiers who had rushed to the scene after being
alerted by the sound of the explosion, Bedine told The Associated
Press.
   ``We are very sorry about the harm done to the soldiers,''
Bedine said, adding that the settlements in the area south of
Bethlehem ``have an excellent relationship with the army.''
   In the occupied Gaza Strip's Shati refugee camp, troops opened
fire to disperse Arab stone-throwers, fatally shooting 17-year-old
Hamis Al Minawi in the heart, doctors at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital
said.
   Five Shati residents were wounded, including a 40-year-old woman
shot in the head, the doctors said.
   Israeli media reports, citing Arab sources, said troops also
shot and killed a 22-year-old Arab man in a clash with Palestinians
who hurled rocks, bottles and bricks at soldiers making arrests in
the occupied West Bank village of Deir Ghassani.
   Israel radio said villagers buried the victim, Luay Barghouti,
immediately after the clash, draping his body in an outlawed
Palestinian flag.
   The army said it was checking both reported fatalities.
   Also Wednesday, 16-year-old Ayman Ahmed Nagar of Gaza's Rafah
refugee camp died, one day after being hit in the head and body by
rubber bullets, his relatives said. They claimed he also was beaten.
   The army confirmed the death but said it was investigating the
circumstances.
   Israeli troops frequently use cork-shaped rubber bullets that
contain metal pellets to disperse stone-throwers. They bruise but
usually are not lethal, although they have caused eye loss and at
least one death earlier this year.
   Last month, the army introduced pointed plastic bullets that
penetrate the skin, but are generally only lethal when fired from
20 yards or closer.
   Palestinians, meanwhile, went on strike for the second straight
day in keeping with orders from underground leaders. It was the
sixth day of strikes in the last 11 days.

factories to slow down to reduce a smog cloud that sent at least 75
people to the hospital.
   The government Program for Pollution Control said the emergency
measures are to remain in effect Thursday.
   ``There is no wind and we have a high nitrogen dioxide content
in the atmosphere,'' said anti-pollution agency spokesman Dimitris
Hadjidakis.
   The agency said levels of nitrogen dioxide, a poisonous
reddish-brown gas formed from auto exhaust, reached 561 micrograms
per cubic meter Wednesday in parts of central Athens, more than
twice the danger level of 200 micrograms.
   A reading of 500 or more calls for emergency measures.
   The state-run National Center for Emergency Help said 55 people
suffering from pollution-caused heart and respiratory problems were
treated at hospital outpatient clincs in the Athens area on
Wednesday. Twenty others were hospitalized after fainting on the
capital's streets.
   A private pollution monitoring organization, the Panhellenic
Center for Ecological Studies, gave a higher figure of 309 for the
number of people requiring hospital treatment.
   Half the city's 730,000 private cars and 15,000 taxis were
banned from a 115-square mile area around the city center while
Athens' 120 biggest factories were told to reduce output by 30
percent, the Environment Ministry said.
   Only vehicles with licence plates ending in odd numbers were
allowed in the area. Both August 31 and Sept. 1 are odd-numbered
days.
   A brown smog layer forms over Athens when warm, still air
creates a temperature inversion layer in the lower atmosphere,
trapping pollutants close to the ground.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A story about a school for beggars, reported by The
Miami Herald and New York magazine, was the invention of a
prankster who specializes in duping the media.
   Alan Abel, sometimes called ``the Happy Hoaxer,'' says he posed
as Omar Rockford, operator of a school for panhandlers in New York,
and got friends who are professional actors to portray beggars.
   ``I do it to shake up the natives,'' Abel, 62, said Tuesday when
he confirmed the hoax from his home in Westport, Conn. ``Between
the latest ax murders and hostages being taken, it provides levity
in the news and a social commentary on the poor.''
   The Herald published its story on Sunday about Omar teaching
beggars to trick people out of their money. But the hoax wasn't
new. Last year, Abel duped a reporter for Newsday, a daily
published in Long Island and New York City, into writing a magazine
story about it, complete with pictures.
   The Herald said it learned about Omar in an Aug. 29 cover story
about beggars in New York magazine, found the Omar School listed in
the telephone book, and set up an interview. Abel showed up with an
impressive array of news clippings about his top ``graduates.''
   Abel's scams go back to the 1950s with a widely reported bogus
campaign to clothe horses. ``A nude horse is a rude horse,'' he
said.
   He once engineered a mass swoon-in on Phil Donahue's show, a
hoax he later said was sponsored by FAINT _ the Fight Against
Idiotic Neurotic TV.
   He once got The New York Times to run his premature obit, saying
he died in Utah while scouting scenes for his horror movie _
``Who's Going to Bite Your Neck, My Dear, When All of My Teeth Are
Gone?''

<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday it will eliminate
some stunts from military air shows after the disaster in West
Germany that killed three Italian pilots and more than 40
spectators.
   The Defense Ministry said new rules, including elimination of
certain stunts, would be in effect for an air show Sunday at Dinard
in western France. It did not elaborate on the rules.
   The ministry also pledged to look carefully at safety
precautions for celebrating the 35th anniversary of the Patrouille
de France, the nation's premier air acrobatics squad, on Oct. 9 in
Salon de Provence in southern France.
   Despite Wednesday's annoouncment, The Ministry said French
regulations on air shows ``were already more severe than in other
European countries.''
   The ministry made its statement after the collision Sunday of
three Italian airplanes during an air show at a U.S. military base
in Ramstein, West Germany. One of the airplanes hurtled into the
crowd, causing the deaths and also hundreds of injuries.
   On June 26, an Airbus 320 passenger jet crashed while making a
low pass over an air show in eastern France, killing three people.

<HEAD>Bakker Proposes A New Plan For Buying Back PTL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BROOKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker proposed a $165 million plan
Wednesday to buy back PTL, and said he is confident he will regain
control of the ministry he lost last year in a sex-and-money
scandal.
   Bakker and his attorney, Jim Toms, met with PTL bankruptcy
trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to present a rough draft of the plan.
   ``We've discussed the terms; we've agreed on everything,''
Benton said. ``The lawyers are now documenting it and as soon as
the papers are ready tomorrow afternoon, and everybody's agreed, we
probably will both sign it and then we'll have us a deal.''
   Canadian real estate magnate Peter Thomas, chairman of Samoth
Capital Corp., earlier offered $113 million to buy the ministry's
assets.
   Thomas said Wednesday he was unwilling to increase his offer but
was skeptical of Bakker's proposal.
   ``Although Samoth enjoys first right of refusal, it does not
intend at this point to enter into a bidding war,'' Thomas said
from his office in Vancouver.
   Thomas said if Bakker's bid fails to materialize, he may renew
his proposal. Bakker ``has been all talk so far'' and unwilling to
reveal his financial backers, he said. ``It makes one wonder where
he's getting the cash from.''
   Bakker said he had the financial backing for a purchase that
would total at least $165 million, including $70 million in cash
put up at closing. Part of the terms of securing a loan to back his
offer was that he not reveal the identity of the lender, he said.
   PTL filed for reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Columbia in June 1987. Donations had plummeted after Bakker left
the ministry in March amid allegations of misuse of money and
revelations of a sexual encounter several years earlier with church
secretary Jessica Hahn.
   When he announced the outcome of the meeting with Benton, Bakker
was greeted at the offices of the Jim and Tammy Ministries, his new
organization, by applause and cheers of ``Praise God!'' and ``Thank
you, Jesus!''
   ``As it stands now, we will be able to have Heritage USA. It's
been a long wait,'' Bakker told volunteers, friends and family
members, many of whom wept with joy.
   ``We're through the basic negotiations. We just had a few
changes to make in our plan,'' Bakker said. ``We'll be working
tonight, burning the midnight oil, and finish the details for
tomorrow.''
   Benton had said that he wanted all bids for the ministry's
assets in before Thursday. Benton will then recommend a buyer to
Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds, who has the final decision, by
Sept. 10.
   ``When you boil it all down, it's a matter of who would provide
the most dollars for the creditors,'' the trustee said. ``My
responsibility in this case was to preserve the assets and sell
them at the highest possible dollar value so that the creditors
could be repaid, if possible, in full.''
   In addition to the $70 million cash, Bakker said, about $80
million would be held to restore the benefits of the ``lifetime
partners'' _ large contributors to PTL who had been promised
long-term perquisites in exchange for their support; and up to $15
million would be used to settle claims against Bakker.
   The ministry's assets include the Heritage USA theme park near
here. With extra funds for improvements and repairs at the park,
the final purchase plan could total $200 million, Toms said.

<TEXT>
   The death toll from flooding climbed to
nearly 700 and thousands of people fled their homes Wednesday as
the Buriganga River flooded low-lying neighborhoods and left
one-fourth of Dhaka under water.
   President Hussain Muhammed Ershad issued an international appeal
for food, helicopters and boats after touring flooded areas in the
countryside, where people were throwing their dead into swirling
waters because there was no dry land for burial.
   Local newspapers in Thursday and Wednesday editions reported 140
more flood-related deaths across the country Wednesday, raising the
toll in recent floods to 676.
   Ershad said Wednesday the official death toll was 250, but the
government's count is generally considered low.
   The independent newspaper Sangbad said most of the victims it
reported died when boats sank or houses collapsed. But it said some
were killed when they were bitten by snakes in the water.
   ``We need food grains, helicopters and river craft from our
friends for tackling the flood,'' Ershad told reporters.
``Everywhere I have gone people have asked for drinking water.''
   In Dhaka, the capital, residents stocked food, anticipating that
floods would force markets to close.
   Several thousand residents from a low-lying area on the
southeastern outskirts of the city were evacuated Wednesday as
waters from flooded Buriganga breached a protection dam and a
10-mile road.
   
   At Victoria Park in the oldest part of Dhaka, about 3,000 people
camped out with the few possessions they rescued from their flooded
homes.
   ``We have now become one family. We are not only sharing our
common sorrows. We are also sharing whatever little we have,'' said
Mohammadullah, a vegetable seller.
   Tears rolled down his face as he told how his 5-year-old
daughter Rahima Khatoon drowned in her sleep Tuesday when she fell
off her bed into the rising water at Keraniganj on the outskirts of
Dhaka.
   Hundreds of people made their way to a high road near the
Buriganga River.
   Abdul Hye, a 35-year-old government clerk, put his two small
children on his shoulders as he waded toward a shelter for refugees.
   His wife, Naila Begum, propelled a pushcart loaded with the
family's valuables and their white cat, Beauty.
   ``We cannot let her die,'' Naila said as she petted the cat.
``She will go with us wherever we go.''
   The Relief Ministry estimated that nearly one-third of the
nation's population of 105 million was affected by the floods. Some
areas had only a few inches of water, while in remote northern
regions people scrambled up trees with their children and meager
foodstuffs and waited for the water to go down.
   Municipal officials in Dhaka, a city of 4 million, estimated
one-quarter of the city was affected by floods. Speaking on
condition of anonymity, they said up to three-fourths of the
sprawling capital could be covered with water before the end of the
week.
   Other officials, also speaking privately, estimated that 100,000
displaced people were seeking shelter in the capital's makeshift
relief camps, open parks, streets and with relatives.
   Floodwaters ranged from waist-deep at spots in Mirpur on the
outskirts of Dhaka to 2 inches outside an office building whose
upper floors house the U.S. Embassy in the Motijheel commercial
district.
   Thousands of laborers and volunteers worked around the clock to
plug minor breaches in the embankment designed to protect Dhaka
from the Buriganga during floodtime.
   So far, few deaths have been reported in Dhaka. Most of the
fatalities have occurred at least 40 miles from the capital.
   Rail service has been suspended in many areas because the tracks
are flooded. Train and boats are the main form of transport in
Bangladesh, where the scores of mighty rivers overflow every summer
and wash out roads.
   Ershad said flood damage this year would be ``many times
higher'' than last year's loss of $1 billion.
   In 1987, floods killed more than than 1,200 people in
Bangladesh, where the per capita income is $150 a year and 90
percent of the population lives below the poverty level, which is
defined as being able to afford a diet of 2,000 calories a day.

<HEAD>Pinochet Makes Rare Appeal For Opposition Support</HEAD>

   President Augusto Pinochet called for
support from opposition leaders on Wednesday after violent protests
followed his nomination as the only candidate in an October
presidential referendum.
   Authorities said hundreds were arrested during widespread
rioting Tuesday and three people were killed, including two
teen-age boys, as residents threw open their windows and banged
pots and pans in defiance.
   Rioting in the streets broke out after the military junta
nominated Pinochet, who took part in the selection process, to be
the sole nominee in an October presidential referendum.
   In a nationally broadcast address Wednesday night, Pinochet made
a rare appeal for opposition backing. In previous addresses, he has
dismissed opponents as ``traitors,'' ``rats,'' ``highwaymen'' and
``cowards.''
   ``Our democracy needs the collaboration of all Chileans,'' he
said. ``I call today on my compatriots, supporters and opponents,
to assume this noble task. Chile needs you.''
   The remarks followed huge demonstratons by thousands of people
in the capital and elsewhere.
   In Santiago alone, 846 protesters were arrested during the
day-long street demonstrations and clashes, a report from the
national police said. It gave no precise figure for arrests outside
the capital, although scores were reported arrested in protests in
most other cities.
   Many of those arrested were being released Wednesday after an
identity check, some without being charged and others cited to
appear before city judges.
   The national police said the dead included two boys, age 14 and
15, and an adult. It said 21 people were injured in the rioting.
   Pinochet, who commands the army, has led the military government
that has governed Chile since September 1973, when the elected
government of Marxist President Salvador Allende was overthrown in
a bloody coup by the armed forces. Allende died in the coup.
   Pinochet was picked in a meeting with the chiefs of the navy,
air force and national police to be the sole candidate in an Oct. 5
presidential referendum.
   If a majority vote in his favor, he will assume a new eight-year
term on March 11. If voters reject him, he remains in power until
1990 when an open presidential election is to be held in conjuction
with elections for a Congress.
   The nomination came despite appeals by the local Roman Catholic
church and several moderate political organizations for a candidate
who would have the backing of both the government and opposition.
   It also ended speculation that the other commanders, who had
publicly expressed support for a civilian nominee, would insist
that Pinochet give up his army commandership in return for the
candidacy.
   The formal nomination declaration refers repeatedly to Pinochet
as army leader and the army commander pointedly made his acceptance
speech in military uniform.
   He can legally remain army leader if he wins the referendum and
remains president.
   Opposition leaders, meanwhile, said that Pinochet's nomination
will backfire.
   `This confrontational decision directly compromises the armed
forces, who will suffer from his defeat in the plebescite,''
Patricio Aylwin, leader of the centrist Christian Democratic Party,
said Wednesday of Pinochet's selection.
   The opposition cites several opinion polls that give a 2-1
advantage to Pinochet opponents in the ballot.
Government-contracted polls give him a slight edge in the vote.
   Speaking to foreign reporters, Aylwin said Pinochet's army
commandership ``acts as a kind of shield, and exerts moral pressure
on his institution.''
   ``Pinochet is too attached to power, and I don't believe he is
willing to give up any of his priveleges,'' he said.
   Aylwin described ``as generally peaceful'' Tuesday's
anti-government protests, in which thousands of people
participated. But he said he expected that the incidents of
violence would be politically exploited by Pinochet's
administration.
   Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez issued a declaration
Wednesday that blamed the violence on the political opposition.
``Once again, extremist groups have sewed death and fear. Those
responsible for these acts are clearly identified with the
(supports of a) vote of `no.'
   Christian Democrat vice-president Andres Zaldivar said, however,
``The only violence occurred where there was police repression.''
Riot police squads had broken the demonstrations with tear gas and
water cannon.
   Aylwin described one of Tuesday's falities, that of a
15-year-old boy, as ``one more youth added to the victims of the
dictatorship.'' The boy was participating in a pot-banging protest
when he was shot twice in the chest by gunmen in a passing car.
   A 1980 Constitution crafted by the Pinochet government calls for
a phased return to democracy, including a resumption of Congress in
1990. However, about a third of the senate would government
appointees and high-ranking military officials. The Congress also
   A declaration signed by leaders of a 16-party opposition
coalition Wednesday reaffirmed their plans to campaign for a vote
of ``no''in the referendum and, if they win, to negotiate with the
armed forces for constitutional changes.

   Montana ranchers nervously hosed down their roofs and moved out
belongings Wednesday as forest fires roared to within a few miles
of their homes. To the south, in Yellowstone National Park,
wildfires driven by strong wind threatened to close more roads.
   In eastern Idaho, shifting winds pushed flames through control
lines and toward ranches and grain fields. Firefighters also
battled blazes blackening forests and fields in Washington,
California and Utah.
   But there was a glimmer of hope amid the continuing struggles to
contain the wildfires: U.S. Forest Service officials said they have
filled hundreds of temporary firefighting positions and had to turn
away volunteers. Only Wyoming now needs more help, they said.
   ``We really appreciate the public concern and willingness to
help in this firefighting effort,'' said Tom Quinn, Rocky Mountain
regional director of fire management. ``Response was positive and
rapid.''
   In Montana, 300 firefighters outside the Scapegoat Wilderness
area tried to keep flames that spread out from the reserve from
burning more private property.
   ``It's not something you can turn your back on because it's
right there,'' said Barbara Krause, whose ranch is only a couple of
miles from the fire.
   Gov. Ted Schwinden on Wednesday urged Montanans to stay out of
the forests during the Labor Day weekend. The state Fish and Game
Commission voted to delay for two weeks the opening of the 1988
hunting season.
   ``We simply don't need any more fires at this point,'' Schwinden
told reporters at a hastily called news conference. ``It's not just
simply a matter of the cost of putting out the fires; it is that we
are pushing our manpower and equipment resources to the limit.''
   He said 5,000 firefighters are battling blazes on 208,000 acres
in Montana. An additional 173,000 acres were burned in earlier
fires.
   The Oregon Department of Forestry also put forest lands off
limits Wednesday, announcing that 3.8 million acres in the eastern
part of the state will be closed to the public for the Labor Day
weekend and until further notice due to the extreme fire danger and
limited resources to fight new fires.
   In Yellowstone, 4,000 men and women are fighting fires that have
scorched nearly 524,000 acres, about 23 percent of the park's 2.2
million acres, according to the park's chief naturalist George
Robinson.
   Windy conditions that ended several days of calm weather played
havoc with efforts to control the 231,000-acre Clover-Mist fire,
burning in Yellowstone and neighboring Shoshone National Forest.
   ``It's an emotional roller coaster,'' said Steve Fuller, an
employee of a park concessionaire. ``One minute the fire lays down
and looks harmless and then the next day, it gets up and comes at
us.''
   The park's south entrance remained closed Wednesday, and
officials closed a road between North Junction and Canyon, two park
villages. They hope to reopen the south entrance Thursday for the
first time in about two weeks, meaning all five gates will be open.
   Another blaze, the North Fork fire, burned within two miles of
West Yellowstone, Mont., but fire officials assured nervous
residents that the flames would not reach the town. About 1,000
firefighters constructed lines and removed vegetation and other
burnable material from the edge of the town, said fire information
officer Bill Pidanick.
   ``The conditions are a heck of a lot better than they were
yesterday,'' he said. ``We don't have the wind.''
   Driven by high winds, the 92,600-acre fire burst out of control
Tuesday afternoon, jumping the Madison River and the main road from
the park's west entrance to Madison Junction. A flareup Wednesday
closed Yellowstone's west entrance for several hours in the
afternoon.
   In Idaho, a pair of strike crews and four bulldozers Wednesday
protected the Star Valley area of eastern Idaho from the raging
Trail Creek fire. National Guard jets surveyed fires.
   ``The majority of the ranches are on alert,'' said Dan Pugmire,
spokesman for Caribou National Forest in eastern Idaho. ``But we
didn't have to alert them. They were all standing outside watching
it.''
   Pugmire said winds shifted with amazing speed.
   ``The winds were going one direction and we had a blowout on the
northeastern flank,'' he said. ``Then the wind shifted 180 degrees
and the fire turned back on its self and began running east. ...
There's going to be some spots that are going to grow on us before
we get a handle on it.''
   The Trail Creek fire southwest of Palisades Reservoir was the
most threatening of 17 major blazes raging across Idaho and up into
the Panhandle National Forest. More than 2,500 firefighters backed
up by National Guard personnel and equipment battled the worst of
the blazes that have burned more than 70,000 acres of forest and
range lands in Idaho.
   California firefighters got a break Wednesday from Mother Nature.
   There were only 243 lightning strikes Tuesday night, compared
with nearly 9,500 the day before, said Karen Terrill, a spokeswoman
for the California Forestry Department.
   By Wednesday morning, firefighters contained most of the more
than 100 brush and timber fires started by lightning Monday and
early Tuesday, officials said.
   But two new fires flared in the Sierra National Forest, one
called the Garnet Fire, over about 100 acres in the Kings River
Canyon in the southern Sierra, and another near Mariposa just
outside Yosemite National Park.
   The Mariposa blaze, which was sparked by children playing with
matches, destroyed at least one home and forced the evacuation of
17 people as it grew to 250 acres, said state Forestry spokeswoman
Kary Weaver.
   In Oregon, firefighters adopted a fall-back strategy against the
Tepee Butte fire, which has burned 35,775 acres of grass and timber
on the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's Canyon
National Recreation Area.
   The blaze will grow to 59,000 acres before it reaches fire lines
being built by 679 firefighters, spokesman Ron DeHart said. ``We
cannot safely put crews up close to this fire'' because of the
extremely rugged terrain and flash fuels, he said.
   Utah firefighters controlled a 525-acre fire near northern
Utah's Pineview Reservoir and a 100-acre brush fire in Butterfield
Canyon, and expect to control a 60-acre blaze in eastern Utah by
Thursday night.
   In eastern Washington state, a brief respite from hot and dry
weather allowed firefighters to gain ground on major fires burning
in more than 23,000 acres of trees and brush.
   But a warming trend is expected over the next few days. ``That's
not good,'' said Ron DeHart, a spokesman for the multiagency fire
coordinating center in Portland, Ore.

   Some state and local Democratic leaders say
that while Michael Dukakis' Republican rivals have made their grab
for the national spotlight, his campaign has been making important
organizational gains in the field.
   Around the country, Dukakis field leaders and Democratic Party
state and local leaders contend the appearance of flagging momentum
on the part of the Dukakis campaign is at worst a temporary problem
_ a part of the ups and downs of a campaign that will balance in
the end.
   Dukakis campaign officials have said they were devoting much of
their summer efforts to building organization in the states, and
party officials in some key states point to organizational gains.

   Richard Nixon's former top aide says the 37th
president not only was reluctant to install an extensive taping
system in the White House, but that he quickly lost awareness that
his every conversation was being recorded.
   ``The historiography of the Nixon administration will eventually
be much the richer as a result of Richard Nixon's decision to
tape-record his meetings and telephone conversations,'' writes H.R.
Haldeman, Nixon's onetime chief of staff. ``Nixon was not thinking
of historians when he made this decision, but they will be the
ultimate beneficiaries.''
   Haldeman discusses the origin of the taping system, which
provided the evidence that eventually drove Nixon from office in
the Watergate scandal, in the summer issue of Prologue, the
quarterly publication of the National Archives.

   Drawn by adventure and hopes of big
profits, Florida's 238 newly licensed alligator hunters are getting
ready to begin the state's first legal gator hunt in 26 years.
   More than 5,000 novice and skilled hunters alike scrambled to
apply for the permits after game officials announced the hunt,
designed to trim an alligator population that was once threatened
by poachers but is now an estimated at 1 million.
   Wide-eyed amateurs will be stalking freshwater swamps, lakes and
streams with hopes of cashing in on their catch, which can bring as
much as $1,000 for a 10-foot gator's skin and meat.

   Rivals in the fight against computer ``viruses''
are spending much of their time battling each other instead of
their common enemy: the software invaders that can secretly destroy
computer data.
   The dispute concerns which of two groups has the qualifications
and impartiality to evaluate anti-virus software for customers. The
competition could slow progress in combating the viruses.
   ``I personally know most of the people in this industry and I
have never seen this kind of animosity,'' Brian Camenker, head of
the PC users group of the Boston Computer Society, said Tuesday.
   The battle centers on products _ called ``vaccines'' _ that are
designed to combat viruses. Viruses are tiny pieces of computer
code that pranksters or others slip into normal programs to
``infect'' computers when used.

   Israel's shutdown of Arab labor federations
with 80,000 workers and an association of 108 charities is
disrupting institutions that Palestinians hope will form the basis
of a future state.
   Palestinians charge that destroying grassroots organizations is
the whole object of Israel's move, coming after the outlawing of
the so-called popular committees that have guided the 8-month-old
uprising against Israeli occupation.
   ``They want them closed so when a Palestinian state comes, it
will find no infrastructure,'' said Walid Asali, head of the
Palestinian Lawyers Association, one of seven professional groups
shut by the Israelis.
   Israeli authorities accuse the organizations involved of being
fronts for Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization. They
claim the groups distribute funds, recruit members or organize
protests against Israeli rule.

   When it comes to representing
California, the banana slug just won't do, Gov. George Deukmejian
said in vetoing a bill that designated the slimy, slothful creature
the state's official mollusk.
   The veto by the image-conscious governor, announced Tuesday,
squashed the hopes of a group of Blue Birds and Camp Fire girls
from the San Francisco Bay area who led the campaign to make the
banana slug a state mascot.
   ``I feel really bad that he vetoed it,'' says Grace Moses, 9,
whose Blue Bird troop worked six weeks lobbying. ``I mean, why did
he have to do that? He didn't know anything about it. I hope he
watched the news about it.''
   Deukmejian said he vetoed the bill because the large, brilliant
yellow mollusk, which can eat poison oak without getting a rash,
isn't a true Californian.

   Delta Air Lines Inc. has grown from a cropduster
to the nation's third-largest airline since it began operations six
decades ago flying from Dallas to Jackson, Miss.
   A Delta Boeing 727, Flight 1141 which originated in Jackson,
crashed on takeoff Wednesday at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.
   The crash came three years and 26 days after a Delta Lockheed
L-1011 jet crashed at the same airport, killing 137 people.
Lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages from that crash are
still in court, although some already have resulted in
multimillion-dollar judgments against Delta.
   Last year, Delta suffered a spate of embarrassments: Pilots
landed at the wrong airport or on the wrong runway; one plane
plummeted toward the ocean because the pilot mistakenly shut off
the engines; another plane was involved in a near miss over the
Atlantic.
   Last year, Delta also grew by acquiring Western Airlines in an
$860 million merger.
   Through it all, Delta has maintained a reputation as a well-run,
safe and financially secure airline.

   U.S. officials raised the death count to 52 but the West Germans

officials also said up to 30 badly burned survivors may die.
   Many grieving families still had not found missing relatives by

   A gene inherited by a third of all white Americans
may be responsible for most cancer of the colon and rectum, and a
search is on to pinpoint this inborn cancer trigger, researchers
say.
   The study, to be published Thursday, suggests one gene _ or
perhaps several _ that are present at birth put some people at high
risk of developing adenomatous polyps. Colon and rectal cancers
develop from these growths.
   Researchers who conducted the work at the University of Utah say
they believe the still-unidentified genetic factor accounts for 50
percent to 100 percent of all cancer of the colon and rectum, which
strikes an estimated 147,000 Americans annually.

   The National Labor Relations Board is widening
the door for unions to recruit millions of health care workers,
telling hospitals they no longer can lump nurses with physicians,
or lab technicians with janitors as a tactic for thwarting
organizing drives.
   In a 153-page set of proposed regulations to be published
Thursday, the NLRB is establishing eight broad categories of
hospital employees as appropriate separate bargaining units.
   A copy of the regulations was obtained in advance by The

   The regulations effectively reverse a 1984 board ruling allowing
for only three or four bargaining units at a hospital unless unions
could prove that the interests of different groups of workers were
so distinct as to justify more.

<HEAD>``Value'' System For Building Savings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking for a disciplined, systematic way to
build up a nest egg for college tuition or retirement?
   Consider a technique that Capt. Michael E. Edleson, an assistant
economics professor at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point,
N.Y., calls ``value averaging.''
   Edleson's idea is a new twist on the old, popular strategy known
as dollar cost averaging, which calls for investing identical
amounts at regular intervals in a vehicle such as a mutual fund.
   But unlike dollar-cost averaging, value averaging provides a
structure that tells you when to sell as well as when to buy.
   The basic idea of value averaging, described by Edleson in the
American Association of Individual Investors' AAII Journal, is to
increase the total value of your investment by a set amount each
month.
   Suppose you want to build up a mutual fund account to $24,000
over the next 10 years to help pay college costs for a child now in
second grade.
   You can pursue that goal by seeing that the account's value
increases by $200 each month through that 10-year period.
   The first month, you simply make an initial investment of $200.
Starting in the second month, you invest whatever it takes to
increase the overall value of your holdings by $200.
   If the net asset value of the fund's shares declines, you will
need to put up more than $200 in the second month. If it rises,
however, you will invest less.
   Assuming that sooner or later the fund enters a period of strong
performance, you are likely to encounter months in which price
appreciation alone increases the value of your holdings by more
than $200.
   In those instances, you don't invest any money at all. Rather,
you SELL, or redeem, enough shares to bring the monthly increase
back down to $200, perhaps by switching the surplus into a
money-market fund.
   A reserve in the money fund will help you keep the system going
in periods when the fund declines, making new monthly investments
of substantially more than $200 necessary.
   Spotted a flaw or two in this whole deal? Well yes, Edleson
concedes, there are some.
   For one thing, the monthly mathematical exercise required makes
it more complicated and time-consuming than a simple dollar-cost
averaging program.
   Investing and redeeming odd amounts regularly can incur
forbidding transaction costs _ one reason why, as Edleson says,
value averaging works best with a mutual fund that has no sales or
redemption fees and generous telephone switching privileges.
   Then there's the problem of taxes on capital gains every time
you sell. You can dodge this if you are operating inside an
individual retirement arrangement that is not subject to current
taxation.
   Otherwise, Edleson says, there is an alternative: ``Simply do
nothing when the value averaging rules indicate that you should
sell shares.''
   Under this approach, you let the surplus stand in the account
for as long as it takes to have the $200 monthly increases catch up
with it. If there is still a surplus when the 10 years are up, no
complaints _ you have exceeded your goal.
   ``This same variation lends itself well to use with dividend
reinvestment and stock purchase plans, a popular tool for
individual investors,'' Edelson notes. In such plans, selling in
small amounts is often impractical or not allowed.
   An obvious objection to this whole arrangement presents itself
readily: You are limiting what your money can achieve. The better
your fund performs, the more potential gains you will miss out on.
   ``You won't get rich quick,'' Edleson acknowledges. But the
point of the system is to encourage both buying at low prices and
selling _ or at least not buying _ at high prices.

<HEAD>Some Canceled U.S. TV Shows Find Overseas Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even for television, the scene sounds
improbable: New York mobsters with Sicilian accents making death
threats in Chinese subtitles.
   But believe it _ the underworld sells overseas.
   From Italy to Australia to Brazil, foreign viewers are so hungry
for American shows that even borderline series like the failed mob
drama ``Our Family Honor'' or the grounded helicopter yarn
``Airwolf'' can be resurrected.
   U.S. producers, meanwhile, are enjoying the windfall. They
expect to collect $600 million in foreign television revenues this
year, up 100 percent from three years ago.
   ``International sales used to be considered gravy,'' said Colin
Davis, president of MCA Television International. ``Now,
international revenue is considered an integral part of a show's
budget.''
   The foreign market, growing steadily for 10 years, has yet to
influence programming decisions directly _ Don Johnson isn't yet
taking afternoon tea and snacking on scones on ``Miami Vice,'' for
instance.
   ``I think those days are still a long way away,'' said Bruce
Gordon, president of Paramount International Television division.
``The producers must first pay attention to American tastes.''
   Still, said Davis, ``There are general discussions now of how a
show will play in the foreign market.''
   In an era of tighter finances in Hollywood, it is increasingly
important that U.S. television shows ``travel'' _ that foreign
audiences be able to understand the stories.
   ``Lucille Ball and `Laverne & Shirley' travel well, because the
comedy is visual,'' said Gordon. ``But `Family Ties' is not visual
comedy. It's spoken comedy. `Cheers' is the same _ it's a play on
words. It's hard to retain the humor (in translation).''
   The most consistently popular shows overseas are
action-adventure programs _ a car chase or a shootout is just as
exciting in Arabic as it is in English. And who watches ``Hunter''
for its dialogue, anyway? ``Even if a show like `MacGyver' is badly
translated, the action speaks for itself,'' said Gordon.
   Action-adventure shows also represent a programming bargain for
foreign buyers. ``The Equalizer,'' which could cost the British
Broadcasting Corp. $1 million an episode to produce, for example,
costs a fraction of that through foreign syndication.
   For the U.S. producers, those fractions add up, and quickly.
   Many television shows are sold to the networks at a loss, with
producers hoping to recoup the shortfall through rerun sales. ``If
you can't make up your (production) deficits with foreign sales,
you shouldn't make the show,'' said Michael Jay Solomon, a top
executive at Lorimar Telepictures Corp.
   The Writers Guild of America is convinced that one of the
brightest areas for television growth rests overseas. The
five-month writers' strike against producers hinged on rerun
payments for foreign reruns, with the writers finally accepting a
compromise payment formula.
   ``Whatever the producers are most hesitant to negotiate is
always where the next boom lies,'' said Arthur Sellers, a member of
the WGA negotiating committee. According to the WGA, while the
United States has one television set for every person, the rest of
the world averages one set for every 10 people.
   Writers and producers alike are looking to Europe, where U.S.
television syndication is relatively new and, so far, predictably
profitable.
   In the 1970s, when ``El Show de Dick Van Dyke'' was a favorite
in Paraguayan bars, Latin America audiences represented the
majority of the foreign television audience. Then the Latin economy
slumped. ``The easiest thing to do in Latin America now is to
sell,'' Solomon said. ``The hardest thing to do is collect.''
   European markets began to open up in the 1980s, as more and more
countries allowed the operation of private networks. Italy was
followed by France, and private networks are emerging in Britain,
West Germany, Denmark and Spain.
   Roughly 60 percent of international television revenues now come
from Europe, according to Davis. And the future looks healthy.
   In 1975, Paramount International Television sold about $1
million in programming to eight European stations. In the 1987
fiscal year, Paramount sold programs to 78 European outlets with
revenues of more than $47 million.
   The biggest potential audience, though, may be one of the
hardest to reach: The Soviet Union.
   But who knows? Maybe the Soviets are ready for ``The Gong
Show.'' Then again, maybe world peace is more important.

   The new director of the Miss America
Pageant says there will be so many changes in Saturday's production
that he fears raised eyebrows among fans of the 67-year-old
tradition.
   But before anyone gasps, Leonard Horn is quick to point out that
the swimsuit competition is still in place _ even though he
believes there may be other means of proving a young woman's
fitness.
   The winner still will take her stroll down the runway, a much
longer runway this time, to the tune of ``There She Is.''
   And the show still will feature an elaborate stage production,
but new musical director Donald Pippin has created a livelier tempo
that's not quite rock 'n' roll but just as spirited.
   Horn is more concerned about the long-time supporters of the
pageant who bought seats even in the lean years when it was
weathering attacks from feminists. Some of those supporters have
unhappily learned they've been bumped from their box seats to make
room for bigwigs representing the eight corporate sponsors and even
some high-rollers from Atlantic City casinos.
   Horn also knocked out a production number and replaced it with
video segments showing the finalists being interviewed by the
judges. He eliminated a prepared speech each inalist gave in the
evening gown competition in favor of asking the women unrehearsed
questions.
   ``It won't be a cutesy question,'' he said. ``It will be
sufficiently provocative to elicit an intelligent response which
might give us further insight into her ability to articulate under
pressure.''
   The changes were necessary to keep the pageant up to date and
attract the younger, female audience that had stopped watching the
show in recent years, Horn said.
   ``Some people believe the pageant has gotten stale,'' said Horn,
who took over when Albert Marks retired last year after 37 years.
   ``All we're trying to do is give it the vigor it once had ...
and reconfirm that it's a positive program that deserves people's
respect.''
   For the 51 contestants, from the states and the District of
Columbia, a week of pageantry and preliminary competitions lead to
Saturday night's nationally televised finale.
   Reaching Atlantic City has been a rocky trip for some
contestants.
   In th District of Columbia, the entire pageant was restaged
after national pageant officials found problems with the judging.
The original winner, Edwina Richard, became first runner-up and has
said, ``I feel like I became a victim.''
   In Georgia, the winner, Frances Frazier, has denied accusations
she was promised the crown when she was a runner-up the year
before. Earlier this year, a former Georgia pageant board member
wrote to national officials saying she had firsthand knowledge that
blacks were not being given a fair shot at the crown.
   Miss California not only had to watch in dismay as a defeated
contestant loudly denounced the pageant but also had to respond to
rumors she suffers from anorexia nervosa, the eating disorder.
   In the New Jersey state pageant, some contestants grumbled that
one of the judges was acquainted with the winner.
   About 80,000 young women enter local contests that lead to the
Miss America Pageant. More than $5 million in cash and tuition
scholarships is available this year. Miss America receives at least
a $30,000 scholarship and the income from a year of personal
appearances.
   Gary Collins will serve as host of the two-hour special for the
seventh year. His wife, 1959 Miss America Mary Ann Mobley, will be
co-host. The show airs live on NBC-TV at 10 p.m. EDT Saturday.
   Performances in the talent category this year will be mainly
singing, dancing and playing musical instruments. But there will
also be belly dancing, an Irish dance and a gymnastics act.
   This year's Miss America, Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, won her title in
part by performing a Hawaiian-Tahitian dance in a hot-pink costume
with a bare midriff.
   Following preliminary competitions and interviews with the
judges, the top 10 finishers will compete for the title before a TV
audience estimated at 70 million viewers.
   Judging the finalists will be Richard Dysart and Blair Underwood
of television's ``L.A. Law''; NBC News correspondent Deborah
Norville; Miss America 1971 and broadcaster Phyllis George; actor
George Peppard; actress Eva Gabor; columnist Dr. Joyce Brothers;
Olympic ice skating gold medalist Brian Boitano; movie producer
Lili Fini Zanuck; model agency founder Eileen Ford; Parade magazine
publisher Walter Anderson, and William Farley, chairman of Farley
Industries.

   Faced with the prospect of losing the
grain farm that has been in their family for most of this century,
seven members of the Richard Kurth family turned to a new cash crop
_ marijuana.
   That decision, discovered in a drug bust last fall, has turned
many in this farm town of 1,700 against the Kurths. Some see no end
to the controversy, particularly after most of the family received
reduced sentences.
   ``I don't believe they will ever be able to live in the
community again,'' said Joan Stewart, editor of The River Press
newspaper. ``It's never going to be forgotten.''
   Yet some of the Kurths say all they want to do is remain on the
4,500-acre farm and cattle feedlot, which still faces foreclosure.
   ``I'm not going to let a community shove me out,'' said Cindy
Halley, daughter of Richard Kurth, the family patriarch.
   It's not just the family's action that has upset Fort Benton.
About 960 valid signatures, far more than the 549 needed, have been
gathered on a petition to recall Chouteau County Prosecutor Tom
Sheehy over the way the case was handled.
   ``This type of prosecution will only encourage more drug
traffic,'' says the petition, which expresses concern over plea
bargaining and notes the Kurths were not required to post bond.
   ``This `prominent' family has never paid a cent of bail, they
weren't brought in,'' complained Winnie Appleby, who runs a local
motel.
   Dr. William Gertson, heading the recall effort, said people
wanted Sheehy to turn the case over to federal prosecutors
``because we felt like he was inexperienced and we felt like he was
so liberal that nothing would happen.''
   The prosecutor, who is suing to invalidate the recall petitions,
defended the plea bargains that resulted in convictions of Richard
Kurth and his wife, Judy, both 57, and five others.
   ``Guilty is guilty,'' Sheehy said.
   He noted that District Judge Chan Ettien released the family
members on their own recognizance and reduced sentences that Sheehy
recommended.
   Richard Kurth received four concurrent 20-year sentences, with
all but five years suspended, while his wife received a five-year
sentence with all but one year suspended. Both could be out in less
than a year, with good behavior. Sentences for the others were
suspended altogether or deferred.
   Ettien struck a nerve with his courtroom comment that the social
ill from marijuana use ``does not approach that of alcohol.''
   The judge, who declined to elaborate, wrote in his sentencing
order that, except for one criminal offense, the Kurths had been
``an exemplary group.''
   Some people in town agree. Howard Axtman, who sells farm
equipment and had two Kurth children in his Boy Scout troop, said,
``I'm not a supporter of what they did. I don't think anyone is.
But they were good people.''
   Up to a point, they were typical people, too.
   Most farmers in Montana have suffered years of drought and low
prices for grain.
   But in 1985, Richard and Judy Kurth decided that to pay their
debts they would grow marijuana. They have said the decision
stemmed from an offhand remark made by an officer of Norwest Bank
in Great Falls.
   ``Perhaps in jest, perhaps not,'' the bank officer suggested
they could save their ranch only by ``growing an illegal cash crop
of some sort, perhaps marijuana,'' defense lawyer Ralph Randono
said at the couple's sentencing.
   He contended the bank was ``very aware'' of what the Kurths were
doing.
   Frank Shaw, president of the bank, termed the comments
``preposterous and total fabrications.''
   After beginning the operation, the couple decided to recruit
their adult children. All three agreed, along with two of their
spouses; son Bill Kurth's wife, Lisa, was not involved, authorities
said.
   ``Kind of the way I took it was either you hop on the bandwagon
and help out or I guess you can just go down the road and find
another job,'' said son-in-law Clay Halley, ``because it was either
do this and save the ranch or there wasn't going to be any ranch.''
   In nearly two years, authorities say the family sold $400,000
worth of marijuana.
   In addition to the sentences, the state is seeking $750,000 in
taxes and interest, based on the estimated value of the 2,155
marijuana plants seized in last October's raid.
   Family members had a lot to learn about growing marijuana, they
said in a recent interview. First, they went to libraries and
bookstores. They also received advice from customers, lost some
crops and learned from mistakes.
   ``Just like anything else in agriculture, you try it and if it
doesn't work, you change it and try it again,'' Clay Halley said.
   Hired men and customers came and went at the farm, 14 miles
south of Fort Benton, without knowing marijuana was being grown and
dried in four separate buildings with automatic watering and
lighting systems. Windows and doors in those buildings were locked
and covered.
   Even sheriff's deputies, serving papers involving the Kurths'
debts, had no reason to suspect anything, said Undersheriff Doug
Williams.
   The loan agreement showed Norwest Bank had agreed to forgive the
Kurths' $1.3 million loan if they paid $275,000. They paid $125,000
and hoped to make the final payments by April 1988, then
restructure their debts with the Federal Land Bank, save the farm
and stop growing marijuana.
   ``Our objective was to not continue this thing over two years,
and when we got done in two years, to still have a ranch,'' said
son Doug Kurth.
   Just 5{ months before the last loan payment was due, federal and
county law officers arrived at the Kurth property, after receiving
a tip.
   The Kurths say they were actually relieved to see law officers
pull up on Oct. 18. Two days earlier, men posing as Drug
Enforcement Administration agents had attempted a robbery. The
following day, they had received a $25,000 extortion demand.
   But they have since had to face their own young children, deal
with publicity and withstand the continued scrutiny of their
neighbors and the townspeople.
   The family's clothing, cars, travel and entertainment are often
discussed, and many people maintain the Kurths could have altered a
lifestyle described as ``high-flying'' if they had truly wanted to
get out of debt.
   ``They lived so much higher than people who were in debt,'' said
Gertson. ``They were flashy in their dress, flashy in their way of
living.''
   And editor Stewart said of Richard Kurth, ``His lifestyle is not
poor farmer, and never has been.''
   Doug Kurth and his wife, Rhonda, and the Halleys say such talk
is a price they pay for living in a small town. Despite it all, the
two families want to remain.
   Doug summed up the message he'd like to convey to the community,
saying: ``Hey, it's over with. We're paying our debt to society.
Leave us alone.''

   In the five years since a federal panel branded
America's schools ``mediocre,'' states have responded by raising
teacher salaries and heaping layers of tests, rules and regulations
on schools. But AP reporters in all 50 states now find reformers
urging a new route to school improvement: more say from the
teachers, and less from the state, on what happens in the classroom.

<TEXT>
   After spending five years and billions of tax dollars raising
classroom standards and teacher salaries, some states and school
districts are turning to the teachers themselves to lead the next
leg of the journey to better schools.
   But they warn this latest reform effort will take years to reap
benefits.
   Most states, prodded by dozens of reports since a national
commission in 1983 branded America's schools ``mediocre,'' imposed
layer upon layer of ``top-down'' reforms. They raised teacher pay
but also imposed stricter course guidelines and new competency
tests for both teachers and students.
   A 50-state survey by Associated Press reporters now finds a
growing willingness among states and school districts to ease their
regulatory grip on public schools and give teachers a more direct
role in shaping curricula.
   Reformers say teaching, even with fatter paychecks, has become
less attractive because the new rules thwart initiative. And while
students may be better test-takers, they add, reforms to date have
not provided the critical thinking skills needed in a competitive
world.
   ``Most of the reforms so far have been paper and headlines,''
said Beverly L. Corelle, president of the Maryland State Teachers
Association.
   Getting beyond such surface reforms has been difficult in many
schools, however, where educators refuse to acknowledge how bad off
some students are.
   ``Very few schools look at the national picture and realize that
only 15 percent (of high school students) can write a simple
letter. And only a small percentage can locate the United States or
the Atlantic Ocean on a map, or work with a simple bus timetable,''
said Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers. ``So why should anyone change their ways and habits
unless in their gut they feel the system isn't working?''
   Shanker and other reform leaders are now telling states that the
path to better schools goes through the schoolhouse, not the
statehouse _ freeing teachers to try new lessons and ideas, and
students to learn at their own pace instead of in lockstep with
peers.
   Some districts are getting the message.
   A dozen Arizona districts are experimenting with ``outcome-based
education,'' in which students scoring less than a ``B'' on
assignments get extra time and tutoring to redo the work without
getting a poor mark. Utah is spending $1 million on a similar
program.
   ``There are people who say kids need to fail,'' said Dave
Briggs, principal of Alhambra High School in Phoenix. ``I think
that's garbage. We're here to teach you success.''
   Rochester, N.Y., made headlines with a teacher contract raising
top pay to $70,000 from $51,000. But more important than the lofty
salaries, say both the school board and the teachers union, are
``school-based planning teams'' in which teachers and
administrators will plan how to run their schools relatively free
of school board interference.
   A contract with similar provisions _ and teacher salaries as
high as $64,000 _ takes effect this fall in Dade County, Fla.,
which includes Miami, and administrators this summer report getting
as many as eight applications for each opening.
   ``The new thinking is getting teachers more involved in the
decision-making in the school,'' said Pat Crawford, a spokeswoman
for Pittsburgh's public schools where ``instructional cabinets'' of
teachers and administrators can shape teaching techniques for
individual students.
   Minnesota has given most students the right to attend any school
districts they wish. Advanced high school students can even take
courses at public colleges at the state's expense.
   In Moses Lake, one of several Washington school districts being
freed to tailor education programs with less bureaucratic
interference, teacher lounges are suddenly alive with talk about
how to use this new freedom to help the district's low-income
children who aren't achieving.
   ``We are experimenting. This is a search for solutions. We want
to remove the shackles of bureaucracy and regulation that inhibit
creativity and initiative in our schools,'' said Gov. Booth Gardner
of Washington.
   Arizona, one of the only states requiring students at all grade
levels to pass standardized tests, is now excusing first-graders
out of concern for the pressure the tests put on young children.
   ``It's gratifying. I think some political leaders now realize
school reform is more complicated than they thought. They are
straightforward enough to say, well, let's take the other road,''
said Theodore Sizer, head of Brown University's education
department and a guiding force behind the reform wave.
   Since his widely acclaimed book ``Horace's Compromise'' was
published in 1984, Sizer has pressed school authorities to free
teachers from blackboard lectures, dull texts and multiple-choice
tests, to function instead as coaches training students to think
independently.
   Five states _ Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, New Mexico and Rhode
Island _ have said they will free at least 10 schools this year to
try Sizer's philosophies.
   But some fear the odds remain stacked against fundamental change.
   ``In spite of the few examples here and there, I do not see
anything like the will and creativity to achieve radical
restructuring,'' said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie
Endowment for the Advancement of Teaching, which has produced
several widely acclaimed reform documents.
   He and others are especially concerned that reform has created
few meaningful programs for the most troubled students, those at
risk of dropping out because of poverty, pregnancy or parental
neglect.
   There are some. Arizona this year appropriated $4.5 million to
help at-risk children statewide, and Indiana will award $20 million
to local districts to help such children. Colorado is spending
$850,000 on 2,000 disadvantaged preschool children. Florida has
earmarked $23 million to help disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds.
Minnesota requires districts to provide education programs for
pregnant teens and teen-age parents.
   Shanker, whose union this year endorsed the principle of local
school experimentation, as did the rival National Education
Association, said his biggest worry is that schools might be too
cynical to adopt new ways.
   ``If there's an enemy, it's likely to be us,'' he said. ``A lot
of school districts aren't doing anything, and they are praying for
the others to fail because they don't want to look bad themselves.''
   After five years of efforts, reform leaders worry that an
impatient nation will be disillusioned if the latest tactics fail
to pay off.
   ``You can't reform schools rapidly, unless you're faking it,''
said Judith Lanier, dean of Michigan State University's school of
education.
   ``If you're at the beginning of a revolution, you have to
support and encourage different trials _ not condemn the whole
movement if a few things don't work, but accept the complexity of
the task.''

<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, is a look at recent school reforms in all 50
states, and what's ahead.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALABAMA _ State education spending has lagged, and
superintendent Wayne Teague blames Gov. Guy Hunt for insisting he
won't permit new taxes until the Legislature makes schools more
accountable. State scrapped a career ladder program begun in 1985.
Teachers got 15 percent pay raise in 1985, but none since. State
spending per pupil was $2,612, ahead of only Arkansas and Utah. In
Wilcox County, the state's poorest, schools lack air conditioning,
drinkable water and libraries.
   
   ALASKA _ Reform faces obstacles here, with oil revenues down and
just getting to school the biggest educational challenge for many
students. Several hundred disadvantaged students in five districts
were enrolled in a student retention program stressing vocational
education and basic skills. The Cordova School District set up a
four-year fisheries apprenticeship for at-risk youth in that port
city.
   
   ARIZONA _ The state was one of the few to require standardized
testing in each grade. But the Legislature rolled back its
mandatory test requirement for first-graders, saying it put undue
pressure on youngsters. Teacher salaries now average $27,388, and a
pilot career ladder program is in its fourth year in 10 districts.
Legislature this year appropriated $4.5 million to help at-risk
students statewide for first time.
   
   ARKANSAS _ Graduation requirements were boosted in 1983. Last
year, 93 percent of third-graders passed the state's Minimum
Performance Test reading section, compared with 84 percent in 1985.
State requires extra help for students who fail to get satisfactory
scores in grade three or grade six. Students who fail in
eighth-grade are held back. State still ranks near botttom in
teacher pay, with salaries ranging from $14,000 to $25,000.
   
   CALIFORNIA _ Partisan fighting between Gov. George Deukmejian
and state schools chief Bill Honig threatens the teacher pay gains
and higher classroom standards enacted in 1983. Californians will
vote this November on a teacher-initiated measure calling for
minimum funding levels for schools. The state spent $22.75 billion
for public schools, up only 13 percent from 1983-84 levels counting
inflation.
   
   COLORADO _ State is boosting revenues to school districts by
4.16 percent next January to even out disparities between rich and
poor districts. The state appropriated $850,000 for 2,000 preschool
children considered at risk. Colorado has a goal of an 87 percent
high school graduation rate by 1995, but has hovered in the mid-70
percent range since 1982.
   
   CONNECTICUT _ State is in final year of a three-year, $300
million program aimed at reducing class size and boosting teacher
salaries to at least $20,000 in every town. Local superintendents
report increase in teacher applicants. Voted in May to become the
first state to distribute education aid based in part on student
test scores, sending more money to districts where pupils perform
poorly.
   
   DELAWARE _ Education spending grew from $249 million in 1983 to
$355 million in fiscal 1989, and average teacher pay soared from
22nd in the nation to 13th. State mandates testing in grades 1-8
and 11, but program being reviewd because testing focuses on too
narrow a set of skills. State will deregulate four schools to allow
teachers and administrators to reorganize schools.
   
   FLORIDA _ Legislators boosted education spending by 12.6 percent
to $8.35 billion this spring and raised average teacher pay 8
percent. Dade County teachers signed a landmark pact increasing
salaries by 28 percent, topping at $64,000, and giving teachers
broad powers including a voice in hiring principals. With one of
the nation's highest dropout rates, the state earmarked $23 million
to start a program to help disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds.
   
   GEORGIA _ Kindergartners must pass a test to advance to first
grade. Last month the state board approved curriculum revisions and
included mandatory sex education in first-grade and AIDS education
for sixth-graders. But critics say the state underfunds programs
aimed at at-risk children. State is piloting a teacher career
ladder program in several districts this fall.
   
   HAWAII _ Average minimum teacher salaries will rise to $23,000
next February, from $18,689. State has increased graduation
requirements in math and science and reduced average kindergarten
class size to 20 children. Teacher unions complain reform here
remains dictated by the state, with little input from teachers or
others at the school level.
   
   IDAHO _ State boosted education funding two years ago by 9.6
percent and by 6.7 percent this year, to $356 million. Starting
September, new teachers must pass a competency exam, and the state
will start competency testing of sixth-graders. Legislature last
year failed to fund program to help at-risk students.
   
   ILLINOIS _ Education spending declined $75 million in 1987-88 as
Legislature turned aside tax hikes backed by Gov. James Thompson. A
new teacher certification exam is being introduced, but critics
question its toughness. Graduation requirements have been replaced
by ``learning outcomes'' that outline basic skills students must
master, such as essay writing or solving algebraic equations. An
early childhood program for high-risk children is reaching only 6
percent of the state's 112,000 at-risk preschoolers, but funding
may be increased next year. A reform package for the Chicago
district, branded the worst in the nation by outgoing Education
Secretary William Bennett, is still up in the air, pending passage
of Thompson's amended version. If it becomes law, the proposal
would slash bureaucracy and greatly increase parental and
neighborhood involvement with the 594 individual schools.
   
   INDIANA _ Boosted state funding by $631 million in current
biennium, with lion's share toward increasing school year to 180
days from 175. State will give $10 million in grants to schools
where students excel. Starting this year, Indiana will award $20
million to help at-risk children.
   
   IOWA _ State appropriated $92.5 million in 1986 to boost minimum
teacher salaries to $18,000, give others across-the-board increases
and provide extra pay increases to outstanding teachers. State is
currently reviewing accreditation standards for elementary and
secondary schools. Gov. Terry Branstad says he will propose new
spending for at-risk students next year.
   
   KANSAS _ State has provided no incentives for local school
restructuring. State has required teachers to pass certification
test since 1986. Since last year, high school graduates must
complete 21 units in core subjects like math, science, social
studies and English, up from 18.
   
   KENTUCKY _ Gov. Wallace Wilkinson has said he will call a
special legislative session in January to push his plan for fewer
controls on local educators and an incentive program rewarding
schools for improvements by students. Wilkinson would also
establish a group of benchmark schools as laboratories for
innovation. State-mandated teacher salaries now range from $13,040
to $27,010, although minimums are often supplemented at the local
level.

   LOUISIANA _ Teachers in poor parishes make as little as $12,200,
but the state has boosted education spending by almost $300
million, much of that to raise teacher pay. State also ended
lifetime teacher certification and provided for performance
reviews. State ranks 49th in literacy, and nearly 50 percent of
high school graduates entering state universities must take
remedial courses. Starting next year, 11th-graders will have to
pass a high school exit test to graduate.
   
   MAINE _ Education spending rose almost 25 percent to $430
million this year, one of the largest increases in any state.
Mandatory starting teacher salary is $15,500 and average for all
teachers is $23,425 _ well below national average of $28,000.
Teacher certification standards were tightened, and all teachers
must submit ``action plans'' to a panel of peers, outlining course
work and professional activities before their licenses are renewed.
This year the state plans to pilot ``restructuring programs'' at 10
schools that will be free to experiment.
   
   MARYLAND _ Montgomery County schools plan to experiment this
year and give schools more autonomy. State is in second year of
5-year plan to boost school aid, increase teacher salaries and
improve staffing. Maryland's year-old ``Tomorrow Program''
identifies at-risk children and uses public and private funds to
try to keep them in school, using tutoring and private job
experience. High school seniors will be required for the first time
to to pass tests in four areas to graduate.
   
   MASSACHUSETTS _ School finances and teacher salaries are still
reeling from Proposition 2{, a 1980 voter initiative that pared
taxes. Over 70 percent of the state's education graduates leave the
state, often to neighboring Connecticut or Rhode Island where
salaries are better. The state provided some relief on starting
teacher pay in 1985. A state project selects 10-12 schools each
year and allows them to experiment with school day length, textbook
choices and anything else.
   
   MICHIGAN _ Teachers now must renew their certificates every five
years. State included $12 million in its most recent budget for
preschool programs for at-risk children. Utica school district has
pioneered early childhood education and has a program teaching
Japanese to high school students.
   
   MINNESOTA _ Education funding is up $582 million in current
biennium to $3.96 billion. Legislature adopted nation's most
sweeping open enrollment law in 1988, allowing students broad
freedom to choose which schools they attend. Students in 11th and
12th grades can take courses in state colleges with the state
paying all or part of tuition. A new state law requires each
district to provide programs for pregnant teens or teen-age parents.
   
   MISSISSIPPI _ State is dropping standardized testing of
kindergartners next year because of concern that teachers were
being overly influenced by the test and pressuring youngsters. Last
year, Mississippi placed 48th in teacher salaries, with only
Arkansas and South Dakota paying their teachers less. In May,
however, Gov. Raymond Mabus signed a bill raising the average
salary $3,800, to $24,550 next year. ``I think Mississippi has one
of the biggest pay raises for tecahers in '88-89, but we can't be
sure until we see the national averages,'' said Andy Mullins, a
state education department spokesman.
   
   MISSOURI _ The 1985 Excellence in Education Act set state
teacher salary minimums, $17,000 this year, and established career
ladders in some districts. Starting this month, teacher candidates
must pass a basic skills test and aspiring principals and
administrators will face an assessment for the first time.
   
   MONTANA _ No major spending initiatives in recent years. The
average teacher salary is $23,700, 38th in the nation. The state
required new teachers to pass entrance exams for first time in
1986. A proposed state initiative called ``Project Excellence''
would cut class sizes and add librarians, counselors and other
personnel, and give school districts greater flexibility over
curriculum. State will begin student testing in grades 3, 8 and 11.
   
   NEBRASKA _ A bill mandating statewide achievement testing died
in the Legislature this year. State enacted tougher skills
requirements for teachers and passed measures aimed at luring
science experts to teach and raising teacher pay, but the bills
were never funded.
   
   NEVADA _ Students will learn about sex and AIDS and take more
English, science, arts and computer courses this year, and new
teachers face competency tests for the first time. Public school
spending has risen 14 percent since 1986-87 to about $600 million,
and standardized test scores are generally high. But teachers
complain not much has been done about salaries or overcrowded
classes, high dropout rates and at-risk children.
   
   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Faced with teacher shortages, the state has
loosened certification rules to allow people from industry and
recent college grads to teach. Gov. John Sununu signed a law
requiring students who want to drop out at age 16 to meet minimum
competency criteria. The bill also sets a 36-hour work limit for
all 16- and 17-year-olds while in school.
   
   NEW JERSEY _ Increased aid to school districts by $310 million
this year to $3.4 billion. Gov. Thomas Kean won approval for a
measure allowing state to take over failing school districts and
began steps to take over the Jersey City district. State has been a
trendsetter in easing the path from other professions to teaching.
This year's high school seniors are the first to be required to
pass a basic skills test to graduate. Although the test was
criticized as absurdly easy, barely half the ninth-graders in urban
districts passed it.
   
   NEW MEXICO _ Tight finances have forced lawmakers to postpone
implementation of a 1986 reform measure lowering pupil-teacher
ratios. State funding has increased 23 percent since 1984-5 to
$814.9 million, mainly because enrollments rose 7 percent. Average
teacher pay fell to 29th in the nation, $24,219, compared with 23rd
in 1980. State now requires parent involvement in textbook
selection process.
   
   NEW YORK _ State education spending was up a record $700 million
in 1987-88, to $8 billion. Rochester became a beacon of reform this
year with a teacher contract setting top salaries of $70,000 and
encouraging classroom creativity. Legislature adopted a measure
aimed at helping poor New Yorkers get a free public college
education. State is studying a new teacher licensing system to set
standards that would be among the toughest in the nation, including
requiring new teachers to have a master's degree. New York City
started a pre-kindergarten program this summer for youngsters who
might have trouble in school.
   
   NORTH CAROLINA _ State plans to hire 11,000 more teachers by
1993-94, and lower class sizes to 23 in elementary grades, and 26
in upper grades. The state aims to provide second-language
instruction to all elementary students, and roughly 60 of the
state's 140 districts now do so. The state has a 2-year-old career
ladder program in 16 school districts, but teacher unions oppose
it. State allotted $30 million for summer programs for students not
meeting promotion requirements; 80,000 attended them this summer.

   NORTH DAKOTA _ With agriculture and energy depressed, state
money for education dropped to $346.4 million last year from $388.7
million in the 1981 biennium. Some schools have cut library
services, counseling, foreign languages and upper-level math and
science. Average teacher salaries dropped from 36th in the nation
in 1981 to 47th in 1987, $21,660.
   
   OHIO _ The teacher union has run TV commercials attacking school
underfunding. State funding rose 3.4 percent this year to $3.3
billion for the state's 1.8 million students. New teachers must
study more liberal arts and pass a test to be certified. Columbus
and Toledo have a career ladder plan, under which teachers get more
money and other incentives but remain in the classroom.
   
   OKLAHOMA _ No major funding increases in recent years.
Legislators cite a critical shortage in foreign language teachers
and very few minority teachers. Last statewide teacher raise was in
the 1985-86 school year. Only about 16 percent of eligible at-risk
students are covered by early childhood remedial programs.
   
   OREGON _ No major funding increases recently. The Legislature
appropriated $8.1 million in 1987 in state and federal funds to
reduce the dropout rate among at-risk students, with a goal of
having 90 percent of high school seniors graduate, compared with
current 75 percent rate.
   
   PENNSYLVANIA _ State appropriated $500,000 last year for a
dropout prevention program. Gov. Robert P. Casey is pressing
lawmakers to establish a minimum starting teacher salary to replace
outdated $6,000 level set in 1963. Starting in November, aspiring
teachers will have to take a state certification test. Students in
the class of '89 have to take more English, math, science, social
studies and art. Easton will begin a ``shared governance''
experiment this fall establishing a collegial model of partnership
between teachers and principals.
   
   RHODE ISLAND _ State education spending rose 10.3 percent to
$345.5 million for 1988-89. About $250,000 will be spent on
students at risk of failing regular classes. Teacher salaries,
averaging $34,150, are among nation's highest, but there are still
shortages of math and science teachers. Hope High School in
Providence will be one of state's first magnet schools, emphasizing
arts.
   
   SOUTH CAROLINA _ The Education Improvement Act of 1984, financed
by a sales tax hike, will provide $268 million in extra funds for
education this year. Average teacher salaries up to $24,241, and
the state began a merit pay system. Starting next year, all high
school students will have to pass an exit exam to graduate from
high school.
   
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ Average teacher salaries are lowest in the
nation: $19,750. Politicians say further hikes are unlikely because
property taxes are stretched to the limit. Teacher recruitment is
now a major concern, according to officials. The state ordered
stiffer high school requirements in 1986.
   
   TENNESSEE _ Gov. Ned McWherter has boosted spending on adult
illiteracy, and the state raised starting teacher salaries by
$1,575 to $16,925 in 1988, the largest increase in state history
and a shift from the merit pay championed by his predecessor, Gov.
Lamar Alexander.
   
   TEXAS _ Ruled for the first time that geology textbooks be
required to teach evolution by name. Passed sweeping reform package
in 1984, including higher teacher salaries and controversial
``no-pass, no-play'' rule requiring students to pass courses to
participate in extracurricular activities. A basic skills test for
aspiring teachers introduced in 1984 will be replaced next year by
a test all college students must pass before they take more than 60
credit hours, in addition to other tests.
   
   UTAH _ The centerpiece of the state's reform efforts is a $42
million-a-year career ladder system, which allows teachers to earn
an average of $1,800 on top of an average salary of $22,621 by
taking on additional responsibilities or through outstanding
performance. Fifteen districts operate year-round. State
distributes $1 million a year to encourage districts to allow
students to learn at their own pace.
   
   VERMONT _ Education spending has jumped from $89 million in
1986-87 to $130 million in fiscal 1989. State boosted its share of
special education funding. Board of education is considering
requiring teachers to major in liberal arts or science in addition
to a degree in education.
   
   VIRGINIA _ State funding is up 83 percent in less than eight
years, and the school funding formula has been revamped to correct
disparities between richer and poorer districts. State now ranks
25th in teacher pay, averaging $27,436, up from 36th. State started
``Literacy Passport'' program requiring sixth-graders to
demonstrate competence in math and language. Gov. Gerald L. Baliles
set up summer foreign language schools. The state funded family
life education curriculum this year, to start fall of 1989, aiming
at teen pregnancy.
   
   WASHINGTON _ State set a $17,600 minimum teacher salary in 1987,
but overall education spending hasn't gone up dramatically in
recent years. Legislature launched a 6-year pilot program involving
15 districts aimed at grassroots school reform, allowing teachers
to shake up classrooms.
   
   WEST VIRGINIA _ Gov. Arch Moore has signed a reform bill calling
for a statewide student testing program and empowering the state to
take over failing school districts.
   
   WISCONSIN _ Teacher salaries increased an average 6.59 percent
each year since 1982-83 and now stand at $27,755. This year, the
state requires districts to upgrade graduation requirements to
include 4 credits English, 3 of social studies, 2 each of math and
science. A recent teacher survey found 54 percent felt there has
been more negative political interference in school programs in
recent years.
   
   WYOMING _ State spending for fiscal 1989 was set at $209.5
million, up 2 percent from previous year. Teacher salaries now
average $29,378. Education funds have been tight for three years
because of depressed energy prices. State Superintendent Lynn
Simons began a ``Super Schools'' program in 1987, allocating
$85,000 in federal funds to reward schools that encourage parental
involvement or new programs for at-risk children.

   For years, Reggie Sutter and fellow
teachers at Moses Lake High School had looked for ways to break the
traditional public school mold and give students the special
attention denied them in a rigid system.
   This year, Sutter and the others will get a chance to experiment
with reform, freed of state requirements under a pilot program
called ``Schools for the 21st Century'' created this year by the
state Legislature.
   He is among several hundred teachers in 21 school districts
involved in a bold plan aimed at giving the state ``a world class
education system by the 21st century,'' in the words of Gov. Booth
Gardner.
   Backed by $2.1 million in state money to pay teachers for extra
time spent planning, the program will allow the teachers to shake
up their classrooms rather than their bosses and the school boards
who've been dictating what to do.
   ``Now, with the flexibility of the 21st century program, we can
experiment. It gives us a way to create, to do something
different,'' said Sutter, who teaches Spanish and social studies in
Moses Lakes, a central Washington city about 230 miles east of
Olympia.
   Sutter says his first order of business is to expand his
homework hotline, a program in which high school students can call
peers for help with homework.
   ``We're starting a guest speaker program. We're also starting a
telephone counseling service where students can call anonymously
and get referred to places where they can get help for drug
addiction or whatever,'' Sutter said.
   Sutter's excitement can also be found at Moses Lake's Larson
Heights Elementary School. There, teachers are reorganizing
curricula and classrooms for the 300 pupils, many of whom are from
low-income families and lag in achievement.
   ``Basically, what the teachers are doing is creating
opportunities to enrich these kids, to enrich their minds,'' said
P.J. Benedetti, a district official working with the teachers on
alternative education plans.
   For example, the teachers have decided to keep Larson Heights
open until 6 p.m. each day, giving latchkey kids and others a way
to profit from free time.
   ``The kids can use the school computers. They can work on their
homework in a quiet, supervised setting. There will be storytime,
organized recreation, arts and crafts,'' Benedetti said.
   ``I don't think I've ever seen our teachers this excited or this
enthusiastic,'' said Moses Lake superintendent Ben Edlund.

<HEAD>New Jersey Moves to Take Over Troubled Urban District</HEAD>

   Backed by a broad new law, New Jersey is
trying to seize control of a major urban school district it
considers to be educationally bankrupt.
   State officials say schools in Jersey City, New Jersey's second
largest city, are so crippled by political patronage that local
leaders cannot make desperately needed improvements.
   Symptomatic, they say, are curricula on Afro-American history
that end with the Nixon administration.
   City officials disagree and are trying to block the takeover.
   Jersey City is providing the first test of a law enacted in
January giving New Jersey power to take over chronically troubled
schools.
   Kentucky, South Carolina, Texas and New Mexico have laws of
varying strength allowing state takeovers of failing school
districts, according to the National Governors Association. Laws in
Illinois and Arkansas let the state eliminate deficient districts,
and an Ohio law allows the state to revoke a district's charter. A
Georgia law allows financial penalties in the form of reduced state
aid.
   If New Jersey wins, it can abolish the local board of education,
fire administrators and appoint a state superintendent to operate
the district of 32,000 students for five years.
   ``When schools fail, it's adults who failed, and adults should
pay the price,'' Gov. Thomas Kean said when he signed the law.
   Jersey City officials say their city suffers from the poverty
and crime typical of urban districts. They contend that to single
out Jersey City for state takeover is unfair when efforts are being
made to reverse the decay from years of political intrusion under
former administrations.
   The state launched the takeover in May after almost three years
of investigation and monitoring in the district.
   ``I don't think they were looking for anything right. They were
on a mission to point up what was wrong,'' said William Massa,
attorney for the Jersey City Board of Education.
   Takeover hearings before an administrative law judge are
expected to last into January. The earliest the state could take
control is next May, but appeals by the district could further
delay action.
   State investigators said they found financial irregularities,
questionable payroll and personnel practices and incompetent
management. Richard Kaplan, the state's lead investigator, said
district employees are routinely rewarded or demoted based on which
mayoral candidate they backed in the most recent election.
   They also cited low test scores and high truancy rates. Last
year, Jersey City students registered the third lowest passing rate
in the state on a mandatory statewide ninth-grade test.
   Eleven other New Jersey districts, including Newark, are in the
third and final stage of state monitoring that precedes a takeover.
Six of the districts are working with the state to make
improvements, and officials hope the Jersey City action sends a
signal that New Jersey is ready to act again if a district fails to
make the grade.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Betrayed''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Costa-Gavras is unique among world-class filmmakers. He alone
has made a career of polemics on such issues as military
dictatorships (``Z'') and American meddling abroad (``Missing'').
   His films have swayed world opinion while gripping audiences
with his documentary-style drama. Because no one else attacks
social ills on a regular basis, it is regrettable that he stumbles
with ``Betrayed.''
   The film begins with a Costa-Gavras imprint: a graphic depiction
of heart-pounding violence. Over the titles, an acerbic radio
talk-show host spouts insults at his favorite targets: rock music,
fat women and bigots. As he leaves the studio, he is followed by
another car, then is gunned down in a parking structure by unseen
assailants.
   The episode, obviously inspired by the murder of Denver
broadcaster Alan Berg, establishes the timeliness of ``Betrayed.''
But this early promise later dissipates in an illogical and
overstated melodrama.
   A dedicated FBI agent, Debra Winger, unwillingly accepts the
assignment of trying to infiltrate a Midwestern hate group
suspected of the broadcaster's murder. Posing as a harvester
machine driver, she quickly ingratiates herself to a good ol' boy
charmer, Tom Berenger. With his overalls, homespun manner and two
small motherless children, he seems as American as a Big Mac.
   The romance grows, and marriage is proposed. But Berenger has a
challenge for his wife-to-be: He wants her not only to approve of
his secret paramiliatry society but to participate in its robberies
and murders.
   An intriguing situation, but it is destroyed by overkill.
Winger's first trial is taking part in a midnight ``game'' in which
a young black is set loose in a thicket with a gun and 10 bullets
and hunted down by dogs and heavily armed farmers. Even ``Rambo''
fans would have trouble buying this one.
   Following the trend of recent films, Winger's FBI superiors are
portrayed as incompetents. They allow her to remain in a
life-threatening situation with no backup or support. They don't
even follow her and Berenger when the pair embark on an
assassination trip. Nor is there concern when Winger herself
commits a crime, shooting a guard during a bank robbery.
   The actors strive for credibility, but the Joe Esterhaz script
and Costa-Gavras' overzealous direction defeat them. Debra Winger's
intensity helps keep her character alive. Tom Berenger proved his
talent for portraying evil in ``Platoon,'' but he has no chance
here to reconcile the normal-seeming farmer and the hate-warped
psycho.
   The United Artists production is rated R for language and
violence. Running time: 127 minutes.

<HEAD>J.C. Penney Creates $700 Million Employee Stock Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Company Inc. has borrowed $700 million
to create a leveraged employee stock ownership plan in conjunction
with an expanded stock buyback program, the retailing company
announced Tuesday.
   The so-called LESOP, a tax-qualified employee benefit trust that
invests in the sponsoring company's securities, will replace J.C.
Penney's existing employee savings and profit-sharing retirement
plan.
   Penney employees already own 15 percent of the company's 132
million common shares outstanding through their existing retirement
plan.
   The LESOP is using the proceeds of the $700 million loan to
purchase a new issue of convertible preferred stock from the
company, officials said. The preferred stock is convertible into
about 11.8 million shares of the company's common stock, about 9
percent of the currently outstanding common shares.
   Penney will use the $700 million it gets from the employee trust
to buy back 15 million common shares from the public. Therefore,
the employees will end up controlling 31.6 million common shares,
or about 24.5 percent of the common shares that ultimately will be
outstanding.
   William R. Howell, Penney's chairman, said the plan would help
boost shareholder value.
   ``We see these steps as strengthening the interests of our major
constituencies: our investors, our consumers and our associates
(employees).''
   ``It won't really have an effect on our day-to-day operation,''
said company spokesman Harvey McCormick. ``As far as long term, it
should boost our earnings per share, reduce costs, and increase our
cash flow.''
   Such employee stock ownership plans commonly have been
implemented by corporations anxious to place a large block of their
shares into friendly hands, thus helping thwart potential raids.
Penney's plan is the largest such LESOP yet created, according to
some reports.
   Penney said it would redirect its annual contribution from the
savings plan to the LESOP. Last year, those contributions were $50
million.
   Penney stock rose $1.87{ a share to $48.12{ Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge suffered the steepest drop in eight months in July, but few
analysts expect a substantial slackening in growth anytime soon.
   The 0.8 percent decline reported Tuesday in the Commerce
Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators was the biggest
since last November, when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the
aftermath of the October stock market crash.
   But economists noted that the index posted an exceptionally

   The nation's largest organization of certified
public accountants has voted to end its 82-year-old ban on
accepting certain fees and commissions, a move officials said would
allow CPAs to become more competitive.
   The ruling council of the 272,000-member American Institute of
Certified Pubic Accountants, under pressure from the government,
voted 191-5 Tuesday to drop bans against accepting compensation for
financial planning that CPAs have long said invite conflicts of
interest.
   The institute had been under pressure by the Federal Trade
Commission to allow commissions for non-audit work performed by
accountants.

   The stock, bond and currency markets showed little reaction
after the government reported a 0.8 percent drop in its main
indicator of the economy's strength, the biggest decline since
after the crash of the stock market.
   Tuesday's report actually comforted some economists and
investors who feared the economy was expanding too rapidly, raising
the danger of higher inflation, higher interest rates and
eventually a recession.
   The government also said Tuesday that factory orders fell 3.5
percent in July, the biggest monthly drop since January 1987. But
economists said the decline had little significance because it was
caused mainly by a swing in the volatile category of defense orders.
   ``For those people who were worried that we were in for a major
acceleration of inflation, these numbers probably calm some
nerves,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of the Wefa Group, a
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., economic forecasting firm.
   Stock prices generally rose Tuesday in a slow session, although
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 3.20 points to
2,038.23 after a 24-point gain on Monday.
   The dollar fell Tuesday against most major currencies, while
bond prices finished slightly higher. The yield of the Treasury's
30-year bond, which falls when the market strengthens, dipped to
9.32 percent from 9.33 percent late Monday.
   Chimerine said the reports should help encourage the Fed to hold
off on any further tightening moves unless new evidence of
inflation surfaces.
   The decline in the leading indicators was the biggest since last
November, when the index dropped 1.0 percent in the aftermath of
the October stock market crash.
   Economists noted the index posted an exceptionally strong
increase in June and cautioned against reading too much into a
one-month downturn.
   ``Despite the declines, we're not going to have any slowing in
the imminent future,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with
Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York.
   U.S. manufacturing, which languished earlier in the decade
because of the strong dollar, has rebounded. The weaker dollar has
fueled a resurgence in sales of American goods overseas and
businesses have responded by spending more to upgrade and replace
plant and equipment.
   But demand for U.S. goods has been so strong that some analysts
are concerned that factory capacity will be strained, pushing
prices higher.
   Factory orders, excluding the defense category, were down 0.7
percent in July following a healthy 2.9 percent gain in June.
   Samuel D. Kahan, an economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities Inc. in Chicago, said that despite the overall drop in
factory orders in July, ``there is very little evidence yet that
the manufacturing sector is moderating.''
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at
a 3.3 percent annual rate in the three months ended in June and at
a 3.4 percent pace in the first quarter.
   In an effort to ease inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve
Board has attempted to dampen economic growth by boosting
short-term interest rates since late March.

   Oil futures prices have moved higher in moderate
trading, with gasoline prices advancing in pre-Labor Day weekend
activity.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for October
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, rose 5 cents per barrel Tuesday to close at $15.27.
Other contract months also rose.
   Refined petroleum products moved higher, with near-term
contracts for gasoline leading the way. Contracts for September
delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.79 cent to finish at
48.03 cents a gallon. Other contracts also finished higher.
   Wholesale heating oil for September rose 0.38 cent to 43.14
cents a gallon while other contract months also gained.
   Analysts said gasoline prices were strong in anticipation of
demand during the Labor Day weekend and helped boost crude and
other energy prices after a weak opening.
   ``Gasoline was strong but that's not surprising seeing we're
heading into Labor Day, the last hurrah of the summer driving
season,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst at E.D.&F.
Man International Futures Inc.
   Analysts said expectations that the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly report would show lower gasoline stocks helped
keep prices strong. However, traders were expecting buildups in
crude and heating oil, which helped slow the rally in crude prices,
they said.
   The API report, released after the close of trading, indicated
U.S. crude oil stocks actually dipped by 4.2 million barrels last
week while distillate stocks fell by about 3 million barrels.
Gasoline stocks rose by 699,000 barrels.

<TEXT>
   Some rivals in the fight against computer
``viruses'' are spending a large portion of their time battling
each other instead of their common enemy of software invaders.
   The bitter battle concerns which of two groups has the
qualifications and impartiality to evaluate anti-virus software for
potential customers. The competition could slow down progress in
combating viruses.
   ``I personally know most of the people in this industry and I
have never seen this kind of animosity,'' Brian Camenker, head of
the PC users group of the Boston Computer Society, said Tuesday.
   The battle centers on products _ sometimes known as vaccines _
that are intended to deal with viruses, which can wreak havoc with
computer programs. Viruses are tiny pieces of computer code that
pranksters or other outsiders can secretly put into normal
programs, which ``infect'' computers when used.
   Although they are rare and have done limited damage so far,
viruses are feared because of their potential to be spread from one
computer to another, wiping out millions of dollars' worth of data
in minutes.
   Publicity over viruses such as the Israeli virus, the Christmas
virus and the Pakistani Brain has led dozens of companies and
individuals to create anti-viral software products, but there is no
easy or reliable way for customers to know whether they work.
   Customers and producers agree on the need for an independent
panel of experts to review the software. The question splitting the
industry is who should be in charge.
   Pitted against each other are the 2-month-old Computer Virus
Industry Association, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., and a
loose collection of other computer figures, led by Jon R. David, a
consultant in Tappan, N.Y., and Harold Highland, editor of
Computers & Security magazine in Elmont, N.Y.
   The controversy heated up Monday with the publication of a
front-page article on the debate in MIS Week, a weekly trade
newspaper.
   Each side accuses the other of using sloppy techniques and
manipulating the testing process for its own purposes. The
intensity of the debate has left some software developers disgusted
with the whole business.
   ``We're not casting our lot with anyone,'' said Raymond Glath,
president of RG Software Systems Inc. in the Philadelphia suburb of
Wilow Grove, Pa., who has nonetheless been loosely aligned with
David and Highland.
   An independent testing panel is essential because most computer
users have never seen a virus. If they had a useless defense, they
would not know it until a virus invaded and caused problems.
   ``This kind of testing needs to be done professionally and
carefully, particularly if other people are going to place reliance
on it,'' said Robert V. Jacobson, president of New York-based
International Security Technology Inc.
   Jacobson has cautiously thrown his support behind the Computer
Virus Industry Association, which was formed in June by a group led
by John McAfee, president of InterPath Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif.
The group has eight corporate members.
   The industry association is assembling an independent university
testing panel composed of people from three New York metropolitan
area colleges: Pace University, Adelphi University and Sarah
Lawrence College.
   The head of the university testing program is John Cordani, who
teaches computer science in the business schools of Adelphi and
Pace. Cordani is a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and has a
part-time post in the computer security division of the Pentagon.
   David and Highland say Cordani and the three schools don't seem
to have the necessary credentials. They also say McAfee's InterPath
products will have an advantage in the testing, which has not
begun, because McAfee is the inventor of a virus simulator that
will be used as one of the testing mechanisms.
   Highland is getting money from his magazine's British-based
publisher, Elsevier Advanced Technology Publications, for his own
review of a range of anti-viral software, with the help of David
and various consultants around the world.
   But Highland said he is not interested in operating an ongoing
software review board: ``At the age of 71, I'd rather sit on the
sidelines. I'm having more fun running a magazine.''
   The virus issue is crucial enough that a major invitation-only
symposium on it is scheduled in October by Deloitte Haskins & Sells
and the Information Systems Security Association. Most major
corporations and government agencies are probing the issue.
   For all the controversy over anti-viral products, computer
security experts agree that the best protection against viruses is
not new software, but prevention. That means being extremely
careful about dangerous practices _ such as loading computers with
software that is offered free on computer bulletin boards.

   Two former bank officers sentenced to prison for
crimes that contributed to the near-collapse of Continental
Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. say they are relieved that
years of court proceedings are over.
   Sentenced in a hearing were John R. Lytle, a former Continental
vice president, and William G. Patterson, the head of energy
lending at the now-defunct Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City.
   The two pleaded guilty to charges stemming from an alleged
scheme that left Continental Illinois holding millions of dollars
in bad energy loans from Penn Square. Penn Square failed in 1982,
and Continental Illinois nearly collapsed two years later following
an unprecedented run on its deposits.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur sentenced Lytle to 3{ years in
prison, despite Lytle's pleas for probation. Shadur sentenced
Patterson, who choked back tears as he spoke in his own defense, to
a 2-year term.
   Lytle, 53, and Patterson, 38, pleaded guilty June 30 to one
criminal charge each for a scheme in which Lytle allegedly took
kickbacks in exchange for arranging to have Continental buy
millions of dollars in risky energy loans from Penn Square. The
maximum sentence allowed under their plea bargain was five years.
   ``I'm going to be able to put a red circle on my calendar which
signals the end of this affair,'' Lytle told the judge before
sentencing. He said he had lived under indictment for more than six
years.
   Patterson, who held his head and cried as he spoke, said he was
sorry for his actions and was concerned about his family. He also
had sought a sentence of probation and community service.
   ``I'm sorry for the people in Chicago and Oklahoma,'' he said.
``I think of that a lot.''
   Patterson's attorney, Burck Bailey, said after the sentencing
that ``We're relieved to have it behind us.''
   Bailey said he was convinced the ordeal had harmed Patterson's
long-term health. He said Patterson had to be carried from court
when acquitted of charges in Oklahoma related to Penn Square, only
to find out the next day he had been indicted in Chicago.
   Testifying before his sentencing, Lytle said he accepted
responsibility for his actions. He asked the judge to sentence him
to no more than six months in prison and assign him to work with
the poor on Chicago's West Side.
   But Shadur said Lytle seemed, at times, ``unwilling to confront
the realities'' of what he had done.
   ``You allowed your conduct as a bank officer...to be driven
impermissibly by your desire for personal benefits,'' the judge
told Lytle.
   Lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank funds and
Patterson pleaded guilty to a charge that he aided and abetted
Lytle. The pleas came two months after a trial of the two ended
with a deadlocked ury.
   Prosecutors said Patterson had manipulated Lytle and a third
man, Oklahoma drilling contractor Jere Sturgis, in schemes to save
his own failing bank. Sturgis was acquitted of wire fraud charges.
   Defense attorneys contended Continental Illinois, which was kept
afloat by a $4.5 billion government bailout, was saddled with the
troublesome energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy.
   Bailey said his client was in over his head when assigned to
handle Penn Square's oil and gas leasing loans. He said it was a
time of seemingly endless expansion, causing bankers to ``throw
caution to the wind.''

<HEAD>Griffin Gets Resorts Stockholder Approval, But Not Nod From
Regulators</HEAD>

   Entertainer Merv Griffin has received
approval from a majority of Resorts International Inc. stockholders
to buy the gaming and real estate company, but state gaming
regulators have thrown up a roadblock.
   Griffin's proposed trust agreement _ needed before he can buy
the Resorts stock from Class A shareholders and controlling
stockholder Donald Trump _ failed to win approval Tuesday from the
state Casino Control Commission.
   The trust agreement is necessary in case the commission finds
Griffin ineligible for a New Jersey gaming license. In that case,
the trust would run the company until Griffin could appeal the
decision or sell off the company's assets.
   The commission voted 3-2 against the proposed trust agreement,
largely because it calls for a trustee to take control of The
Griffin Co. rather than just the Resorts stock. Griffin officials
wanted the trust agreement to cover The Griffin Co. to ensure the
firm can take advantage of prior tax losses of Resorts, potentially
worth $100 million.
   Griffin's deal to buy Resorts was to expire at midnight Tuesday,
but Robert Trump, vice president of the Trump Organization, said
after the commission meeting that he expected Griffin to extend the
offer for another 30 days.
   Griffin was present at Tuesday's hearing, but did not testify.
The former talk show host said afterward he had asked the Internal
Revenue Service for clarification on the tax issue, and he still
expects the deal to go through.
   Commissioners Carl Zeitz and W. David Waters argued that The
Griffin Co. did not do enough to satisfy the law concerning the
structure of the trust.
   Griffin also must obtain approvals from the Atlantic City
Housing Authority and the Bahamian government where a Resorts
facility is located, said Resorts President I.G. ``Jack'' Davis.
   The deal also is contingent upon settlement of shareholder
litigation now pending in the Delaware Chancery Court and another
lawsuit by Showboat Hotel Casino.
   Trump, who owns Resorts Class B stock _ which has 100 times the
voting power of the Class A stock _ will receive $135 a share, or
about $96 million. Trump will also receive another $63 million to
break his management agreement with Resorts, and he will then buy
the company's unfinished Taj Mahal casino project for $255 million.
   Holders of the 5.7 million Class A shares will receive $36 a
share under Griffin's offer, or a total of $205.2 million. On
Tuesday, holders of 2.9 million Class A shares _ just slightly over
the number needed to approve the proposal _ agreed to accept
Griffin's offer. More than 236,000 voted against the deal, and more
than 58,000 abstained.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court panel has ruled in
favor of the maker of the drug Bendectin in a class-action suit by
some 1,150 plaintiffs who claimed the anti-nausea drug caused birth
defects.
   The attorney for Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., maker of
Bendectin, said the decision by the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of
Appeals upholding a 1985 U.S. District Court decision was the most
important yet in Bendectin-related litigation, which has been
active for years.
   ``It shows the plaintiffs' lawyers lost fair and square,'' said
Frank Woodside III, Merrell Dow's attorney.
   A federal court jury in Cincinnati decided in March 1985 after
five weeks of testimony that the drug did not cause birth defects
when taken in prescribed doses by pregnant women.
   The three-judge appeals panel upheld the verdict, as well as
Judge Carl Rubin's decision to keep the jury from seeing all
plaintiffs who had birth defects.
   Woodside said Merrell Dow has not asked that plaintiffs be
removed in any of the individual Bendectin suits against Merrell
Dow in other courts, but was concerned that ``having hundreds of
children testify'' may have distracted the jury and attorneys in
the class-action case.
   Stanley Chesley, one of the attorneys representing more than 800
individual suits in the class action, did not return phone calls
Tuesday.
   Appeals Judge Nathaniel Jones dissented in part Tuesday by
saying the judge should have first met with the excluded plaintiffs
before denying them their day in court.
   The appeals court also affirmed Rubin's decision to split the
trial into two parts. If the jury had found that the drug caused
defects, there would have been subsequent trials to determine any
negligence or damages.
   The court also upheld Rubin's ruling that the district court did
not have jurisdiction in 80 of the 1,150 cases. Those 80 cases were
dismissed or sent back to state court.
   An estimated 32 million pregnant women worldwide took Bendectin
or its overseas version, Debendox, from 1956 to 1983. Merrell Dow
voluntarily removed it from the market in 1983, although it
maintains the drug is safe and does not cause birth defects in
children.
   Merrell Dow said in a news release that it had won 22 jury
verdicts or judgments in Bendectin birth defect suits, and was
appealing four trial verdicts won by plaintiffs.
   Woodside said dozens of lawyers across the country were awaiting
the appeals court ruling before deciding if they should file
similar claims against the company, which is based in suburban
Reading.
   ``It's going to have precedential effect all over the place,''
Woodside said. ``This opinion is a very thorough review of all the
issues presented to the court of appeals.''

   Eastern Airlines has 140 fewer flights today, but
because of a federal judge's ruling still employs 4,000 workers it
wanted to lay off.
   Eastern is going ahead with previously announced plans to
curtail service from 14 cities in the aftermath of an order Tuesday
by U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker. The order allowed route
cuts but barred the company from making mass layoffs without
negotiating with its unions.
   ``Massive layoffs are not, and shall never be, business as
usual,'' Parker wrote in a 50-page opinion. ``The Railway Labor Act
requires Eastern to bargain with its unions before taking
unilateral action to eliminate 12 percent of its workforce.''
   Parker signed a preliminary injunction barring Eastern from
``altering in any way the status quo working condition of Eastern's
pilots, machinists and flight attendants.'' A trial will be
scheduled later.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes called the decision ``gravely
wrong'' and said the carrier would file an emergency appeal.
   ``Eastern, like any American business, must be allowed to prune
money-losing operations,'' Bakes said in a statement released at
Eastern's headquarters here. ``We must be able to take prudent,
although sometimes painful, measures in the best interests of the
company and our employees.''
   Overall, Eastern is discontinuing 204 flights, mostly in the
West and the Caribbean, with some new flights resulting in a net
reduction of 140 Eastern flights.
   Parker's opinion did not spell out what should happen to the
employees whose jobs were salvaged, even though their duties were
not. Union attorneys suggested they could be transferred, and
leaders of Eastern's three unions said they wanted to meet with
management to discuss ways to cut costs without layoffs.
   Charles E. Bryan, president of Machinists District 100,
Eastern's largest union with 12,000 workers of 32,500 Eastern
employees, called the decision an opportunity for Texas Air Corp.
Chairman Frank Lorenzo to belie his reputation as ``the No. 1
union-buster.''
   ``We're not here as laborers trying to direct the business of
the airline. We're trying to protect jobs,'' said Dan Vician,
vice-chairman of the pilots' local.
   Mary Jane Barry, local president, said the flight attendants
still were willing to offer a job-sharing and leave plan _ rejected
earlier by management _to save jobs and money.
   Lawyers for the three unions submitted financial statements, and
Parker ordered bonds of $25,000 each to indemnify the airline if
the decision is reversed.
   Meanwhile, the airline said: ``Eastern's basic fall schedule
remains intact. Travel agents and passengers can continue to book
flights with full confidence that the schedule will be as
announced.''
   Parker said the service cuts, which reduce Eastern's daily
flights from 1,225 to 1,085, were financially motivated. Eastern
says the route cuts will save $50 million monthly in operating
costs, and the layoffs would have saved another $7 million monthly.
   Eastern posted a second-quarter net loss of $89.8 million,
following a $64.5 million first-quarter loss and $182 million in
1987 losses. Houston-based Texas Air has warned it needs cash to
keep Eastern, some $2 billion in debt when bought 2{ years ago, in
operation.
   Spokesman Robin Matell said the airline has no plans to file for
federal bankruptcy protection, as it had hinted before the ruling.
   ``The only court we're headed for is the court of appeals,'' he
said.
   Union leaders say the federal courts, which have generally been
ruling in their favor this year, probably would make it difficult
for Lorenzo to repeat his 1983 move at Continental, where he used
federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy to void union contracts.
   The union leaders also noted Parker's findings that Texas Air
had worsened Eastern's financial state by taking loans and payments
totaling hundreds of millions of dollars from the Miami carrier to
Texas Air and Continental.
   Parker also said Texas Air and Lorenzo have exhibited an
anti-union bias.
   ``It confirmed what we've been saying,'' Bryan said. ``This is a
federal judge. It's not the unions anymore or our consultants
talking.''
   The cities Eastern is cutting are Albuquerque, N.M.; Fort de
France, Martinique; Las Vegas, Nev.; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Oklahoma
City; Omaha, Neb.; Dallas; Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe; Reno, Nev.;
San Antonio, Texas; San Diego; St. Lucia, West Indies; Tucson,
Ariz.; and Tulsa, Okla.
   The company and its unions still have myriad court battles under
way, including a union effort to reverse the Texas Air sale and
allow employees to buy Eastern.
   Continuing are contract talks with the Machinists and pilots.
The Machinists, in federal mediation since January, will vote Sept.
15 on a company call for $161 million in annual wage concessions.

<HEAD>Senior Bank of Japan Officials Not Considering Rate Hike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior Bank of Japan officials indicated that the
central bank has no plans to raise its discount rate despite recent
interest-rate hikes in Europe and the United States.
   At a briefing Wednesday for Japanese reporters, bank officials
said it is part of the central bank's contribution to international
policy coordination not to push up the key interest rate. The
officials did not elaborate.
   The news sent the U.S. dollar up sharply against the Japanese
yen in foreign-exchange trading. Other central bank officials were
quoted as saying that the Bank of Japan might have to intervene to
stop the yen's decline.
   Kyodo News Service said Bank of Japan officials made the remarks
after the dollar rose above 136 yen in European trading on the
earlier reports that the Japanese central bank would not raise
rates.
   Last week, West Germany's Bundesbank raised its discount rate a
half point and several European banks quickly followed. The U.S.
Federal Reserve had made a similar move a few weeks earlier.
   Kyodo quoted some Bank of Japan officials as saying the
yen-dollar rates have reached a level that should be watched very
carefully and that action might be warranted if new movements in
the currencies occur.
   The remarks appeared to indicate that the Bank of Japan may
intervene to brake the dollar's rise if the U.S. currency continues
to advance.
   The central bank doesn't want to see the yen slide further
against the dollar because of concern about higher domestic
inflation.
   The yen's sharp appreciation since late 1985 has helped to hold
down domestic prices. But accelerated growth in money supply amid
the present robust economic expansion and the yen's recent downturn
have spawned worries about inflation.
   According to Kyodo, Bank of Japan officials said they would
consider not only the yen's levels against the dollar but the pace
of its decline and the strength of yen selling, in deciding whether
or not to intervene against the dollar's rise.
   The senior Bank of Japan officials, who indicated that no rate
hike is in the works, described the recent key rate increases by
the U.S. and European central banks as aimed at fighting inflation.
   They said the U.S. and European rate increases ``honor the
spirit'' of policy coordination by the Group of Seven major
industrial countries, since it advocates stemming inflation in
order to sustain world economic growth.
   The Group of Seven countries are the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   Some foreign-exchange and money-market participants said
Japanese monetary authorities have refrained from raising the
discount rate because such a move would make Japanese funds more
expensive overseas and may prove counterproductive in keeping the
global economy on an expansionary track.
   ``Japan is a launching pad of investment funds for the world.
The (United States) and other industrialized countries would do
whatever they could to keep Japan from raising interest rates
further,'' said an official at Chemical Bank in Tokyo.

<HEAD>EEC Slaps Antidumping Duties On Korean, Japanese VCR Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community
Wednesday slapped provisional antidumping duties on exports of
video cassette recorders from South Korea and Japan after
complaints by domestic manufacturers.
   The duties follow a surge in VCR exports to the EEC since 1985,
primarily from South Korea who tripled its VCR exports to Europe in
a year's time, the EEC Executive Commission said.
   The duties affect three South Korean companies that account for
all of that country's VCR exports, including Daewoo, Goldstar and
Samsung. The Japanese companies affected are Funai and Orion.
   The commission said South Korea's VCR exports into Europe surged
from 75,000 in 1985, to 425,000 in 1986 and 1.22 million last year.
   Imports from the two Japanese companies more than doubled to
991,000 units in 1986, from 466,000 in 1985. In the first eight
months of 1987, 762,000 Funai and Orion VCRs entered the EEC, the
commission said.
   The duties levied include 29.2 percent for Daewoo; 26.4 percent
for Goldstar; 25.2 percent for Samsung; and 18 percent on Funai and
Orion VCRs.
   The level of the duties was fixed after a commission inquiry
into the sharp rise of VCR imports.
   The Commission began its probe in September 1987 on a complaint
by an EEC industry association representing producers of consumer
electronics. The group complained that VCR imports from the three
South Korean and two Japanese firms surged because of their
artificially low prices.
   The group's members include Philips International BV of the
Netherlands, Grundig AG and Telefunken Fernsehen und Rundfunk GMBH,
both of West Germany, Thomson Grand Public of France and Britain's
Ferguson PLC.
   The Commission said it found that the South Korean and Japanese
companies sold VCRs in the EEC at dumping prices, or at prices
considered unfairly low. As a result, their combined share of the
EEC's VCR market rose to 30 percent last year from 8.6 percent in
1985.
   Since 1985, VCR purchases in the 12-nation EEC rose to 7 million
from 5.8 million European Currency Units (or the equivalent of $7.7
from $6.38 million), the Commission said.
   It concluded the market share gains of the South Korean and
Japanese exporters were made at the expense of the EEC's VCR
industry and that their dumping prices lowered the sales and profit
margins of their EEC competitors.

   The stock market headed higher today with a
boost from a strong dollar and a modest decline in interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.00 to 2,046.23 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 556 up, 319 down and
488 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.65 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The dollar climbed in foreign exchange on reports suggesting
that Japanese officials planned no immediate move to increase
interest rates.
   That, in turn, prompted slightly higher prices, and hence lower
interest rates, for U.S. government securities in the credit
markets.
   Analysts also said hopes were increasing on Wall Street that
Friday's report on the employment situation for August would show a
moderation in job growth, which would presumably ease pressure for
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   With all those positives, however, the pace of trading remained
relatively light as the long Labor Day weekend approached.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone & Telegraph
rose \ to 25\; Exxon gained \ to 46~, and General Electric added [
to 40|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.51 to 149.17. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .40 at 295.31.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.20 to
2,038.23.
   Advances outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in composite
trading of NYSE-listed issues, with 741 up, 644 down and 564

   Big Board volume totaled 108.72 million shares, against 99.28

   The nation's poverty rate was 13.5 percent
last year, about the same as in 1986, the Census Bureau reported
today. That means 32.5 million Americans were living in poverty in
1987.
   In 1986, about 32.4 million people, or 13.6 percent of the
population, were living in poverty. The Census Bureau said the
changes between 1986 and 1987 were ``not statistically
significant.''
   The slight decline in the poverty rate occurred despite the
small increase in the total number of people living in poverty
because the nation's population also grew during the period.
   The Census Bureau also reported that Americans' median family
income rose to $30,850 in 1987, a 1 percent increase from the year
before after adjusting for the rise in consumer prices.
   The report said the nation's poverty rate for whites declined by
0.5 percentage point last year to 10.5 percent. The poverty rate
for blacks was 33.1 percent, up 2 percentage points. The rate for
Hispanics increased from 27.3 percent to 28.2 percent.
   Regionally, the poverty rate in the South was 16.1 percent,
unchanged from the year before. In the Midwest, the rate was 12.7
percent, down from 13 percent. The rate in the Far West was 12.6
percent, down from 13.2 percent, and in the Northeast, the poverty
rate increased from 10.5 percent to 11 percent.
   Between 1986 and 1987 the gross national product grew 3.4
percent, while unemployment fell from 7 percent to 6.2 percent,
according to government figures.
   Today's report on poverty in 1987 was prepared by the Census
Bureau based on a survey of about 58,000 U.S. households last
March. A survey of that size has a standard error of well under 1
percentage point.
   Median family income in 1986 was $29,458, up from $29,269 a year
earlier.
   Median family income indicates that half of all families had
more income than that and half less. Statisticians prefer to use
medians to make comparisons, contending that averages can be
distorted by a small number of families with extraordinarily large
incomes.
   The 1987 poverty threshold varies according to family size, but
the most commonly used figure is $11,612 for a family of four.
That's up from $11,203 in 1986.
   While the rise or fall of national poverty figures tends to
generate the most immediate attention, later debate is more likely
to concentrate on smaller groups.
   In 1986, for example, while the national poverty rate was 13.6
percent, 19.8 percent of children under age 18 lived below the
poverty level.
   For blacks, the poverty rate was 31.1 percent, including 42.7
percent of children under 18. Hispanics had a 27.3 percent overall
rate, including 37.1 percent of youngsters.
   The national poverty rate was first calculated in 1959, when it
was 22.4 percent. The rate fell steadily as national anti-poverty
programs were developed, reaching a low point of 11.1 percent in
1973. Since then it's gone up and down, peaking at 15.2 percent in
1983.
   Federal officials take pains to point out, however, that the
figures over time are not necessarily comparable because of the
increase in anti-poverty programs, many of which help people
without showing up in the official poverty count.
   That's because poverty status is based on cash income, and does
not reflect non-cash benefits such as food stamps, Medicare and
subsidized housing. If those things were counted as income, the
1986 poverty rate would have ranged between 9 percent and 12.5
percent, instead of the official 13.6 percent rate, federal
officials said.

   Regulators say they are planning to spend
billions of federal dollars over the next 10 days in several
transactions to rescue ailing savings and loan institutions.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
said late Tuesday the board was working on several deals. He
declined to say where the next transaction would take place and
said none of the anticipated federal rescues have received final
approval.
   However, the Tulsa World said in today's editions that the bank
board's next move likely would come in Oklahoma with the
consolidation of 14 of the state's most troubled savings
institutions into six holding companies.
   Hoyle said the board was meeting today but would not reveal what
it was considering.
   In a report attributed to unidentified officials in the office
of Rep. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., the newspaper said regulators plan to
sell the holding companies to the highest bidder, thus placing 14
of the state's 48 S&Ls under new ownership.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post in today's editions said the bank
board was preparing this week to spend $1.2 billion to sell or
merge ``a dozen or so'' institutions somewhere in the Southwest.
   Hoyle said that if all goes according to plan over the next week
and a half, the bank board will spend substantially more than that
in several large transactions in a number of states.
   In recent weeks, the board has announced it was spending more
than $8 billion to assist ailing S&Ls, including a major deal in
Texas, which like Oklahoma has been hard hit by the depression in
the oil drilling industry.
   On another front, the bank board was facing a self-imposed
deadline to wrap up negotiations with the Robert M. Bass Group of
Fort Worth, Texas, which is seeking federal assistance to acquire
American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton, Calif., one of
the nation's largest S&Ls.
   The board began negotiating with the Bass Group exclusively on
April 21 and twice has extended the deadline, with the most recent
extension expiring Thursday.
   Hoyle said the board would have an announcement regarding
American by Thursday. Industry sources have said between $1.3
billion and $2 billion in federal money will be required for the
rescue.

   Japan's Nippon Mining Co. Ltd.
plans to shell out $1.1 billion to buy Gould Inc., an electronics
maker struggling to reduce its debt and reverse a string of losses.
   Nippon Mining, one of Japan's 50 largest industrial firms, will
launch a tender offer to purchase all of Gould's 45 million
outstanding common shares of stock for $23.25 a share, the
companies said in a joint statement issued Tuesday.
   The buyout is one of the biggest ever of a U.S. industrial
company by a Japanese concern, topped only by Bridgestone Corp.'s
acquisition of Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. for $2.6 billion
earlier this year.
   ``This transaction fits well with our strategy to enhance the
focus, development and growth of the materials and components
business, particularly copper foil, fuses and fiber optics,'' said
Gould Chairman James F. McDonald.
   Gould's stock price soared in late trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. Gould closed up $7.12{ a share at $22.75.
   Gould posted a net loss of $95.6 million last year on revenue of
$933.4 million. It has been shedding divisions _ mostly those
involve in defense manufacturing _ for several years in an attempt
to reduce its long-term debt, which stood at $250 million at the
end of June.
   On Monday, the company announced it was selling its ocean
systems division, which makes underwater listening equipment for
the Navy, to Martin Marietta Corp. for $117 million.
   Nippon Mining, already Gould's partner in two enterprises,
intends to proceed with Gould's plan to divest its remaining
defense systems business, the statement read.
   Gould, based in suburban Rolling Meadows, will retain its name
and operate as Nippon Mining's wholly-owned subsidiary.
   Gould has 6,500 employees in its remaining businesses and 80
people at its trimmed-down headquarters. While the company
officially said it has yet to determine how employees will be
affected by the deal, analysts believe most jobs will remain in
place, including top management positions.
   ``Basically, I see no signs of change in headquarters or
employment relationships for an 18-month period. It will be hands
off for a while,'' said Julian Menear, an analyst with the Pershing
division of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in Chicago.
   McDonald said the transaction was ``based first and foremost on
maximizing share value for our stockholders.''
   ``By further combining the resources of our two companies, we
believe there is great potential for these businesses to expand,''
he said in the statement.
   Nippon Mining President Yukio Kasahara expressed ``deep respect
and admiration'' for Gould's products and employees.
   ``Gould has a very solid core business in materials and
components,'' he said. ``Despite some of the difficulties
experienced by the company in the recent past, we have great
confidence in the future of that business.''
   Gould and Nippon Mining, which earned $59.8 million last year on
sales of $6.5 billion, have been partners since 1981 in Nikko Gould
Foil Co. Ltd., which makes electroplated copper foil.
   Should Gould accept a competing offer to be acquired by another
company, the agreement contains a provision giving Nippon Mining an
option to purchase Gould's 50 percent stake in Nikko Gould Foil for
$60 million.
   In July, Gould and Nippon Mining formed another joint venture,
Nippon Gould Computer Co. Ltd., to market superminicomputers in
Japan.
   In addition to their joint enterprises, Nippon Mining markets
Gould fuses and fiber optic products.

<TEXT>
   The Secretary-General of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries arrived here after a similar visit
to Iran to discuss ways of curbing over-production by some of the
cartel's member states.
   Subroto, Indonesia's former energy minister, made no statement
on his arrival Wednesday. He was met at Baghdad Airport by Oil
Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi.
   On Tuesday, Subroto met separately with Iranian President Ali
Khamenei and Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh seeking to persuade
them to allow Iraq a production quota of 2.39 million barrels a
day, the same as Iran.
   But there was no word on whether the Iranians agreed to an
increase in Iraq's present quota of 1.5 million barrels a day.
   Iraq has refused to abide by its quota, insisting on parity with
its gulf foe, Iran. The two countries recently began talks on
possibly ending the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   Iraq is pumping an estimated 2.5 million barrels a day,
worsening the over-production problem by some of OPEC's 13 member
states.
   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil publication
based in Cyprus, reported this week that OPEC's production in
August stood at 20 million barrels a day, or 3.5 million barrels a
day over the overall production ceiling. This was seen as a key
factor in declining oil prices.
   Since he assumed his post June 1, the secretary-general has been
trying to find a practical formula that would curb the surplus and
stabilize oil prices.
   He has visited Venezuela, Equador, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and
Kuwait and succeeded in persuading Venezuela to drop its veto
against giving Iraq a quota equal to that of Iran.
   Some OPEC members have opposed raising a member's quota because
it increases production and further weakens prices.
   Iran has been the only member opposing an increase of Iraq's
quota.

<HEAD>Government Urges More Cautious Approach To Price Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top Chinese government officials have decided
against rapid decontrol of state-set prices, a key element in the
nation's economic reforms, in an apparent move to ease unhappiness
with spiraling inflation.
   The cautious approach toward price reform disclosed Tuesday by
the State Council, China's Cabinet, differed from a more aggressive
outline adopted by the Communist Party Politburo in mid-August, and
highlighted the growing debate within the leadership over how fast
China should proceed with its reforms.
   The State Council's stand was widely reported in the official
media Wednesday, with the national evening news devoting five
minutes to explaining the decisions made.
   The council agreed not to initiate further price increases for
the remainder of this year and decided there will be no radical
reforms in the price system next year.
   The nation will continue to restrain construction projects and
other capital investments that have pushed industrial growth to
unsustainable levels and will further control credit and the
issuance of currency to cool off the overheated economy, the State
Council said.
   It also said a five-year plan of price and wage reform outlined
by the Politburo in mid-August is still tentative and subject to
revision.
   The Politburo plan called for removal of price controls on most
commodities in favor of market regulation.
   The plan, while also stressing the need to control a
near-runaway inflation rate, said China's economy ``is full of
vitality and is developing vigorously. The time is favorable to the
price and wage reforms.''
   The 17-member Politburo, the main decision-making body of the
party, is led by General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, the leading
advocate of rapid market-oriented reform.
   The State Council, meanwhile, is headed by Premier Li Peng, who
is thought to be more cautious toward change and more concerned
about the effects of reform on economic and social stability.
   There is consensus in China about the pressing need for price
reform, primarily the removal of state controls so that the value
of goods can be determined by market forces.
   Artificially low state-set prices for many products have led to
chronic shortages, corruption, influence peddling and a thriving
black market. Profiteers commonly buy up low-priced raw materials
and items from state factories and resell them for far higher
prices to producers and consumers.
   Decontrol of prices of some basic goods and foods in the past
year, coupled with the inability of producers to meet rising
consumer demand, have pushed inflation to levels never before
acknowledged in China's communist system. In June prices were 19
percent higher than a year earlier.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Lower On Loan Expirations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to the Agriculture
Department's refusal to extend price-support loans scheduled to
mature today, analysts said.
   Unless the loans are extended, as was recommended Tuesday by a
federal magistrate in St. Paul, Minn., an estimated 400 million to
500 million bushels of corn will be released onto the market.
   The magistrate's recommendation is not binding but it will be
considered by the judge hearing a case brought by several farmers
who are seeking to have the loans extended.
   ``The USDA feels as though they've got a mandate to make their
own decisions with regard to extending loans, which they say they
will not do, and people are worried about an influx of old-crop
corn coming to the market,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   He said the bearish impact of the potential loan expirations was
offset by an increase in grain export business, which was keeping
prices from falling significantly.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.94{ a bushel; corn was 2
cents lower to 1{ cents higher with September at $2.77 a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 3 cents lower with September at $2.51{ a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4{ cents lower with September at
$8.42{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .55 cent lower to .10 cent higher with October
at 71.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .35 cent
lower with September at 81.47 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to
.37 cent lower with October at 39.05 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .48 cent lower to .78 cent higher with February at
50.55 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower on Tuesday.

   Geo. A. Hormel & Co. on Wednesday informed
nearly half of the workers at its plant in Fremont, Neb., that they
would be laid off in a year.
   The notices, given 52 weeks in advance of anticipated layoffs,
are required by the collective bargaining agreement between the
Austin-based meatpacker and Local 22 of the United Food and
Commercial Workers union.
   Notices were issued to 324 employees in the slaughtering,
cutting and rendering operation at the Fremont plant, which
currently has about 770 workers.
   William R. Hunter, executive vice president of operations for
Hormel, said unsatisfactory gross margins and the impact of
large-volume, low-cost producers in the slaughtering end of the
business have been a deterrent to satisfactory operation of the
plant for some time.

<HEAD>GM Unveils New Display System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has unveiled a new display
system for cars that will enable motorists to check their speed,
fuel and lights without taking their eyes off the road.
   The design, displayed Tuesday in Chicago, is based on a system
used in fighter aircraft. It has been adapted for cars using
computerized aerospace design and analysis techniques, GM said.
   The new system, called ``Head-Up Display,'' projects key
information onto the windshield from a box mounted atop the dash.
   ``It takes awhile for people to become accustomed to HUD, but
they don't want to give it up after using it a week,'' said Ray
Lippmann, project consultant for the Delco Electronics subsidiary
of GM-owned Hughes Electronics.
   GM sold 54 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Indy 500 ``replica'' pace
cars equipped with the system to the public this spring, and those
cars have had no problems with the system, said Robert Leggat, a GM
spokesman.
   Leggat said the system will be installed in 500 of the 1989
Cutlass Supreme International Coupes for a price in the $100 to
$300 range, and it will be standard on 2,000 specially built 1989
Pontiac Grand Prix SE Turbo models.
   ``We estimate 10,000 HUD units will be offered in 1990,''
Lippmann said.

<HEAD>Demographics Suggest Housing Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For at least one industry, housing _ including
building, sales and rentals _ the script was written in the 1950s
and 1960s and will be played out in the 1990s.
   The plot is a demographic one: A two-decade bulge of Americans
of homebuying age will have passed through the economy, leaving a
still large but substantially smaller demand for lower-priced
starter homes.
   Among the characters affected will be developers, lenders,
builders, trades people, brokers, materials suppliers and investors.
   ``They have no choice but to accept that notion and accommodate
themselves to the reality,'' says James Wooten, chairman of Lomas
Mortgage USA, and publisher of U.S. Housing Markets, a subscription
newsletter.
   The latest analysis by the newsletter, whose surveys and studies
are widely accepted in the housing industry, offers these
demographic-based projections:
   _Annual household formations gradually will fall to less than
two-thirds of the 1984-1987 average.
   _Private housing starts will average no more than 1.4 million a
year for most of the decade of the 1990s, compared with 2 million
in 1977 and more than 1.7 million in the years 1983-1985.
   _New housing will shift inexorably toward higher price ranges,
reflecting the greater affluence and grander lifestyles of older
buyers.
   _Traditional rental apartments aimed at younger tenants will be
in less demand. Says Wooten: ``Landlords will need to find
innovative products to attract households in higher age brackets.''
   _Housing targeted for older Americans _ those retired or
planning retirement _ will be find a growing market.
   Wooten butresses his conclusions with immutable demographic
evidence:
   In 1975, for example, nearly 40 million Americans were in their
20s, the primary market bracket for apartments and starter homes,
while only 23 million were in the ``move-up'' category of 35 years
to 44 years.
   By the end of the century the numbers will almost flipflop, with
more than 43 million individuals in the age 35 to 44 bracket, while
those in their 20s will have contracted to 34 million.
   These numbers portend a development that might also have a
serious impact on those who currently own homes and are relying on
the equity in them to finance their retirements.
   Wooten describes the potential phenomenon in this way:
   ``As America ages, as the middle-years cohort climbs the ladder
from first moveup and thence to second, third and fourth, the lower
rungs will be holding fewer and fewer potential buyers.
   ``The homes being left behind will be offered to a dwindling
list of prospects.
   ``Thus, in overall terms, the existing-home market will
gradually evolve into a buyers' market, beginning in the lower
regions of the price spectrum.''
   The situation Wooten describes doesn't dictate lower prices, nor
does it mean that prices cannot increase.
   But it strongly suggests that the sharp price increases of the
1970s and 1980s will be, by the year 2000, a thing of the past.

   The stock market showed no clear trend today
after an early advance faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points
in the early going, was down .89 at 2,037.34 by noontime on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 651 up, 529 down and
581 unchanged.
   Stocks headed higher at the opening as the dollar climbed in
foreign exchange on reports suggesting that Japanese officials
planned no immediate move to increase interest rates.
   That, in turn, prompted slightly higher prices, and hence lower
interest rates, for U.S. government securities in the credit
markets.
   Analysts also said hopes were increasing on Wall Street that
Friday's report on the employment situation for August would show a
moderation in job growth, which would presumably ease pressure for
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   With all those positives, however, the pace of trading remained
relatively light as the long Labor Day weekend approached.
   Brokers said the market was still suffering from the apathy and
caution that has predominated in recent sessions.
   Gould Inc. led the active list, down \ at 22\ on volume of
nearly 6.7 million shares. The stock jumped 7[ points Tuesday as
the company agreed to be acquired by Japan's Nippon Mining for
$23.25 a share.
   Farmers Group rose \ to 70\ in the over-the-counter market. The
company and Batus Inc. said plans for Batus to acquire Farmers
Group for $75 a share need regulatory clearance from only four more
states.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .15 to 148.81. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .11 at 295.02.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.72 million shares at
noontime, against 49.69 million at the same point Tuesday.

<HEAD>Georgia Power Tax Probe May Involve Other Individuals, Companies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after the 3rd graf with state Public Service
Commission probe.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal probe into accounting procedures at
Georgia Power Co., involving a possible attempt to avoid paying $50
million in taxes, may involve other companies and individuals, the
government says.
   Court documents made public Tuesday showed the investigation now
focuses on Georgia Power, its parent, The Southern Co., and the Big
Eight accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Co.
   But U.S. Attorney Robert Barr, who confirmed the investigation,
said the probe is continuing and may involve others.
   Meanwhile, the state Public Service Commission said today it has
upgraded its own investigation of tax and accounting practices at
Georgia Power and specifically wants to know whether the utility
attempted to hide vital financial information from PSC scrutiny.
   Barr refused to elaborate beyond what was in the court papers
because a grand jury is still hearing details. He said the
investigation involves possible criminal wrongdoing, including
violations of the U.S. Tax Code.
   A statement issued by Arthur Andersen from the company's Chicago
headquarters denied any wrongdoing. But Georgia Power Chairman
Robert W. Scherer, speaking for the electric utility and Southern
Co., said he was shocked by the allegations and vowed to ``get to
the bottom of this matter.'' The papers raised the question of
whether the companies and their accountants sought to hide about
$61 million in spare parts to avoid paying $50 million in federal
taxes, interest and penalties.
   Key elements in that question are whether parts are classified
as emergency spares or for maintainence and when they become
expenses to the company.
   The papers also raised the question of Georgia Power's
accounting for the sale of 5 percent of the Vogtle nuclear power
plant to the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia.
   In the documents, officials say the deal was treated as a sale
of 5 percent of the $8.87 billion plant for book value purposes,
but as 1.35 percent for tax purposes, saving the company between
$10 million and $12 million.
   The papers include excerpts of taped conversations in which
Southern Co.'s tax chief agrees with an informant that the company
misled the IRS over the tax accounting of the spare parts, but
adds, ``Don't ever say that.''
   The investigation, dating to 1982, is based largely on
information contained in taped conversations between utility and
Andersen officials and the informant, Georgia Power employee Gary
Gilman, who is getting paid for his participation and been exempted
from prosecution, the court papers show.
   The papers also include affidavits requesting search warrants at
the downtown Atlanta headquarters of Georgia Power as well as the
home of Tim Fallaw, Southern Co.'s director of taxes.
   The affidavit by IRS Criminal Investigation Division agent
Arthur D. McGovern Jr. alleges Fallaw and at least five Georgia
Power employees and four Andersen employees knowingly participated
in a scheme to hide the incorrect accounting of spare parts.

<HEAD>Winery Owners Win Legal Battle With Brother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed an attempt
by the younger brother of Ernest and Julio Gallo to gain one-third
ownership of the world's largest winery.
   However, U.S. District Judge Edward Dean Price ruled Tuesday
that E&J Gallo Winery's trademark infringement suit against Joseph
Gallo will proceed to trial on Nov. 15.
   Ernest and Julio Gallo had charged that use of Joseph Gallo's
last name on a brand of cheese he produced violated their
trademark. Joseph Gallo countersued, contending that his older
brothers comingled assets from their parents' estate to begin the
Modesto, Calif.-based Gallo Winery in 1933.
   Price said he found no legal basis for Joseph Gallo's contention.
   The judge said Joseph Gallo's allegation that Ernest and Julio
Gallo concealed part of the parents' estate ``clearly fails.''
Price said evidence presented to the court of the Gallo family
making wine before prohibition is ``mostly the stuff that family
anecdotes are made of.''
   ``The court can only conclude that Ernest's administration was
appropriate and that all of the assets of the estate were reported
and administered,'' the judge said.
   ``It was always our belief that once the true facts were known,
this ludicrous and false claim would be thrown out of court,''
Gallo Winery spokesman Dan Solomon said.
   Attorney Dennis Rice said he will continue trying to let Joseph
Gallo use his own name on his own products.
   ``I continue to believe Joseph is entitled to use his own name
in his own business,'' Rice said. ``We intend to move forward with
that phase of the case at the appropriate time.''
   Price said several issues must be resolved in the trademark
trial.
   They include a contention by Joseph Gallo that the winery made
false statements in applying for a trademark to the name Gallo,
which means rooster in Italian. Ernest and Julio Gallo contended
that their father began using the trademark in 1909.
   ``The court cannot say that a fraud was practiced upon the
trademark officials by the winery during the registration
process,'' Price said. ``It is simply the position of the court
that the record does not establish that the statements made to
secure the trademark, as a matter of law, bar the winery from the
relief it seeks.
   ``That issue remains for trial,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Sentences Bottling Company to `Corporate Imprisonment'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said his sentence of
``corporate imprisonment'' for a soft-drink bottling company
convicted of price fixing was unprecedented, but was justified for
a company that ``did not have a conscience.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert G. Doumar suspended the sentence and
placed Allegheny Bottling Co. of Maryland on probation Tuesday,
saying any violation of probation would result in the U.S. Marshal
being sent to ``padlock every facility Allegheny owns.''
   Doumar also imposed the maximum fine of $1 million, suspending
$50,000 and ordering four top corporate officers to perform as much
as two years of full-time, unpaid community service.
   ``The corporation cannot come in here, profit to the tune of $10
million and walk away with a $1 million fine,'' Doumar said. ``I
cannot imagine any company being more tied up with illegal
activity.''
   James H. Walsh, a lawyer for Allegheny, said he would appeal the
sentence, adding that he could find no precedent of corporate
imprisonment.
   Doumar also ordered that Allegheny Bottling not sell any of its
assets without the court's permission.
   Walsh said Allegheny's parent company, Pepsico, had planned to
sell some of Allegheny's assets this week and that the sentence
could result in a ``financial fiasco.''
   Doumar said he would consider the transactions in private but
would not allow the company to be left with no one to fullfill the
terms of probation.
   The government said Allegheny, a Pepsi bottling franchise, and
its arch rival, Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottlng Co., ended years of
cola wars in 1982 by secretly rigging wholesale prices in Virginia
and Maryland.
   Prosecutors said a number of executives, including Maryland
multimillionaire Morton M. Lapides, who founded Allegheny,
orchestrated the conspiracy. Lapides later sold the company, which
is now owned by Pepsico.
   Doumar said virtually every executive at Allegheny was in on the
scheme. ``Where was there a beacon of some sanity?'' Doumar asked.
``Was there any? Did anyone care? Why didn't anyone care?''
   ``Some 200 years ago, the Lord Chancellor of England said, `You
cannot expect a corporation to have a conscience when it has no
soul to be damned and no body to be kicked ... Obviously, Allegheny
Bottling Co. did not have a conscience...''
   Doumar said he could find no similar case of corporate
imprisonment to justify his sentence, but added, ``stone walls do
not a prison make.''
   He said the sentence would discourage other potential price
fixers from making illegal agreements with competitors.
   Lapides and James Harford, former president of Mid-Atlantic
Coca-Cola, were found guilty by a federal jury in May of price
fixing.
   Last week, Lapides and Harford received three-year prison terms,
with all but six months suspended, and were fined $100,000 each.

<HEAD>Maxwell Communications Reports Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC, the publishing
group headed by British media tycoon Robert Maxwell, on Wednesday
reported a slight increase in its first-half profits.
   The company said it earned 71.9 million pounds, or about $121
million before taxes in the period ended June 30, up 2 percent from
70.5 million pounds, or $118.6 million, in the first half of 1987.
   Revenue jumped 37 percent to 505.7 million pounds, or $851
million, from 370.2 million pounds, or $623 million.
   A Maxwell spokesman said most of the gains came from the
company's core publishing businesses. Professional and electronic
publishing both enjoyed an outstanding half-year, he said.
   The core businesses are now being positioned within Europe ahead
of the freeing of trade barriers within the 12-nation European
Economic Community in 1992, the spokesman said.
   The company's publishing services in Britain and the United
States are to be offered in Spain, Belgium, West Germany, Italy and
France, he said.
   Separately, Maxwell said it began talks with Macmillan Inc., the
New York-based publishing and information concern, about the
possibility of acquiring all or part of its information division.
Macmillan had rejected as inadequate Maxwell's outstanding
$80-a-share tender offer that values the company at $2.34 billion.

<TEXT>
   Macmillan Inc. has discussed a takeover of part
or all of the company with Maxwell Communications Corp., which has
an outstanding $2.34 billion tender offer for the publishing and
information services concern, both sides said Wednesday.
   Macmillan had rejected Maxwell's current $80-a-share tender
offer as inadequate. But the company said it has provided
London-based Maxwell with information on its operations.
   The information pertains to Macmillan as a whole as well as its
information services group. Macmillan said in a statement its
chairman and chief executive officer, Edward P. Evans, met with
British media tycoon Robert Maxwell on Tuesday to discuss a
takeover of all or part of the company.
   ``We have an agreement to hold talks,'' said a Maxwell spokesman
in London.
   Maxwell previously had expressed interest in acquiring only the
information services operation, a unit that could fetch as much as
$1.1 billion.
   Separately, Maxwell said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission it has received permission to proceed with the
bid and acquire more than 50 percent of Macmillan. Federal
regulators allowed the time period in which they must raise
antitrust concerns to expire last week.
   Maxwell's bid topped a $75-a-share tender offer launched by the
Robert M. Bass Group of Texas, which owns about 9.2 percent of
Macmillan's outstanding shares.
   Bass' overtures prompted Macmillan to devise a restructuring
plan that essentially would split the company in two and pay
shareholders a special dividend. But a court blocked Macmillan from
proceeding with its plan.
   The publishing company, which is appealing the court order,
indicated recently it might sweeten its restructuring proposal but
did not unveil any details.
   Macmillan's shares consistently have traded above the $80 mark.
In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillan was
off $1.37{ at $82.24 a share.

   Prices on the London Stock Exchange edged lower
Wednesday after a quiet session as players found little reason to
alter their positions.
   ``We've seen a few nibbles in the cheap stocks but otherwise
there's been no real direction,'' one equity salesman said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 1.2
points, or 0.06 percent, to finish at 1753.6.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 1.78 points at 2036.45
as London trading drew to a close, but market watchers said Wall
Street's mediocre performance was not moving London equities.
   Dealers said concern still lingered over rising global interest
rates and the growing British trade deficit, although these fears
provided more of a backdrop than a stimulus to Wednesday's session.
   On the whole, they said there was little news to guide the
market away from its summer torpor.

<HEAD>Comedian Finally Sells His Sonoma County Winery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLOVERDALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deadpan comic, self-nominating
presidential candidate and vintner Pat Paulsen, who has been trying
to sell his Sonoma County winery for more than a year, has finally
made a deal on the property, the company reported Wednesday.
   Paulsen's general manager, George W. Litras, said the comedian's
name will remain on the label and he will continue as the wine's
prime promoter and consultant. He has agreed to make 40 public
appearances a year for the wine.
   ``We hope to take full advantage of Pat's marketing ability,''
said Litras, adding that the new owners hoped to raise production
to 35,000 cases in less than two years.
   No sale price was named, but Paulsen's 20,000-case winery and
other property, including the 55-acre town of Asti, first listed
for $3.7 million. The deal includes Paulsen's 3.3-acre tasting
room, delicatessen, gas station and some houses.
   The buyers are reported to be Mark Majestic of Palos Verdes, and
Neal Broidy of Transaction Securities of Oakland.
   Pat Paulsen Vineyards, whose label prominently carries Paulsen's
underscored name and sad-looking portrait, gets its grapes from 37
acres of cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc and chardonnay planted
on a 500-acre Alexander Valley ranch.
   Aside from his wry, dry humor, Paulsen is well known for his TV
appearances with the Smothers Brothers, who also make wine under
their own label, and the fact that Paulsen has been ``running'' for
U.S. president for some 20 years.
   ``It's tough campaigning,'' Paulsen once said, ``kissing hands
and shaking babies.''
   Wine sales plunged when Paulsen first put the winery on the
market, as distributors feared the wine would not sell without his
name. In May, in a move to assure distributors that the label was
safe, Paulsen announced he would continue running the winery but
was looking for an investor as partner.
   ``He (Paulsen) has a national recognition and quite a large
following, and that helps sales,'' Litras said at the time, adding
that the wine itself was good enough to ``stand on its own merits.''
   In 1985 and 1986, two Paulsen generic wines, $4.25 offerings
labeled ``Refrigerator White,'' got very high marks for quality
from the wine writers, following a 1.5-liter 1984 gamay that was
lauded as superior and a buy at $6.50. All of Paulsen's wines,
including gewurztraminer and muscat canelli, are in the premium
price range, currently priced from, $6 to $11.

   The Washington Public Power Supply System has
reached tentative agreement with bondholders to settle its part in
a giant lawsuit arising from WPPSS' 1983 default on bonds sold to
finance two nuclear power plants, a supply system spokesman said
today.
   Trial in the fraud and misrepresentation case is scheduled to
begin Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz. Remaining defendants include 19
public utilities in Washington, three engineering firms and a
financial adviser firm to WPPSS.
   WPPSS spokesman John Britton said in a telephone interview from
Richland, Wash., the tentative settlement was reached late Tuesday.
   He said the plaintiff bondholders had agreed to dismiss all
claims against WPPSS based on securities fraud, misrepresentation
and violation of state law.
   In exchange, ``We're not going to contest that we have an
obligation to repay the bonds,'' said Britton.
   The agreement apparently means that while there will be little
or no money involved, WPPSS would not contest any money that might
be paid into an account for the two terminated plants, WPPSS Nos. 4
and 5.
   ``They (WPPSS) got out for the right price _ zero,'' Chuck
Shigley, administrator for the Snohomish County Public Utility
District, one of the largest remaining defendants, told the Herald
of Everett, Wash.
   Details of the agreement were being withheld pending a formal
announcement from the federal court in Tucson, which has
jurisdiction over the case.
   The court clerk, Elaine Williams, said there were no
announcements from the court regarding a settlement.
   ``Well, it's not a done deal,'' said Paul Bernstein, attorney
for bondholders who have alleged they were defrauded when they
bought the bonds.
   Chemical Bank, a plaintiff as trustee for bondholders in the
case, has had control of the WPPSS 4-5 account since after default
occurred in 1983.
   Britton said no insurance money was involved in the agreement.
   He also said the agreement must be approved by the WPPSS
executive board, which has scheduled a special meeting Friday at 11
a.m. in Richland.
   Britton said the tentative settlement would ask U.S. District
Court Judge William Browning to sever WPPSS from the suit and stay
any proceedings agains the supply system. The process could last
several months.
   In the legal action, dubbed Multi District Litigation 551,
bondholders sued the supply system, 88 utilities, bond
underwriters, various directors and managers, engineering firms and
advisors after WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion worth of bonds.
   Many defendants have settled over the past year, for a total of
$331 million. That includes bond underwriters and more than 60
utilities.
   The terminated plants are located at the Hanford nuclear
reservation and Satsop, west of Olympia.

<TEXT>
   Litton Industries Inc., a maker of
electronics gear, ships and automated factory equipment, said
Wednesday its profits rose 23 percent in its fourth quarter and 21
percent for the full fiscal year.
   Litton announced earnings of $43.7 million, or $1.66 a share, in
the quarter ended July 31, up from $35.4 million, or $1.33 a share,
in the fourth quarter of its 1987 year.
   Sales totaled $1.31 billion, up from $1.23 billion a year
earlier.
   In its full 1988 fiscal year, Litton earned $167 million, or
$6.33 a share, up from $138.1 million, or $5.16 a share, the
previous year.
   Sales for the year were $4.86 billion, up from $4.42 billion in
1987.
   Litton reported strong growth in its industrial automation
group, based in Florence, Ky., and renewed growth in its satellite
oil exploration operations, carried out through the company's share
in Western Atlas International of Houston.
   Litton's Ingalls shipbuilding operaton in Pascagoula, Miss.,
which makes Aegis-class cruisers and the new LHD-1 Wasp class
amphibious assault ship, reported a decline in sales, which the
company attributed to the cyclical nature of defense contracting.
   Sales were flat in Litton's biggest division, advanced
electronics, which produces high-technology gear for military and
civilian markets.

   Grain and soybean futures closed higher Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade on indications that a long awaited
increase in foreign demand for U.S. grains was beginning to surface.
   ``There's been a light pickup in overall business and people
realize there's some pent-up demand in the marketplace,'' said Ted
Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Prices had opened lower and made little movement until midday,
following strong indications that East Germany had purchased
300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   India was believed to have purchased 250,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices while Mexico reportedly bought 50,000
metric tons of U.S. soybeans.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.97{ a bushel; corn was 4

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BellSouth Corp. on Wednesday unveiled an
electronic gateway that will allow computer users to reach several
information services with a single local phone call.
   BellSouth, the first Bell company to offer such a service, said
its TranstexT Universal Gateway is available in the Atlanta calling
area. After the initial introduction there, BellSouth plans to make
the gateway available in other cities in its nine-state region.
   ``We believe information services are an important'' segment of
the telecommunications industry ``and it's important for our
business to be involved,'' said John R. Gunter, BellSouth vice
president for information services.
   But Gunter, alluding to several failed attempts by companies to
launch videotex services, said BellSouth will proceed slowly and
``we're going to be listening a lot'' to see how information
service providers and users respond to the gateway.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, in modifying the consent
decree that stripped American Telephone & Telegraph Co. of its
local Bell operating companies, ruled last year that Bell companies
could establish gateways to transmit electronic information
supplied by others. He continued to bar them, however, from
originating any of the information themselves.
   Without a gateway, computer users with a modem must
pre-subscribe to the various information services that are
available and dial into each one separately. They also are billed
by each separately.
   Using the BellSouth gateway, a computer user needs only to
subscribe to it and can then dial one phone number to reach
multiple information services. Subscribers will be billed by
BellSouth Advanced Networks, an unregulated subsidiary, for use of
the gateway and for the information services they used.
   Currently, eight services are available through the gateway and
10 more are scheduled to be added soon, the company said.
   The services that are already on line offer information about an
Atlanta theater company, local and national news, the stock market
and travel, among other things. One service sponsored by an Atlanta
hospital provides health and fitness information and plans soon to
offer an on-line heart test. Another service allows callers to
``chat'' electronically with one another.
   Gunter said the company hoped to sign up 300 customers during
the initial offering and slowly grow to 1,000 in Atlanta before
offering the service in other areas.
   Gateway charges are $1.50 per hour from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. and $3
per hour during the other 12 hours of the day. Users would be
charged an additional fee depending on how much information they
access _ typically about 60 cents during the day and 40 cents at
night, Gunter said.
   Customers also must pay for the cost of access to any of the
information services on the gateway. A couple of the services
charge nothing, but the cost of others range up to $50 an hour.
   Computer users may pay more for some services obtained through
the gateway than if they dialed into the service directly. But,
depending on the time of day, some services may be cheaper through
the gateway.
   For example, Travel Plus, which is part of General Videotex
Corp.'s Delphi service, charges $7.80 an hour on the gateway, day
or night. But when a caller dials into Delphi and calls up Travel
Plus, it costs $7.40 per hour during the evening but $17.40 during
the day. The daytime rate reflects the higher cost of data lines
needed for computer transmissions, said Jon Gilbert, marketing
director of General Videotex.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil companies submitted 371 bids totaling
more than $190 million Wednesday in an effort to grab up
bargain-priced leases on 270 tracts of offshore properties in the
western Gulf of Mexico.
   The high bids ran to more than $131 million.
   Sohio Petroleum Co. had the highest bid of the day with a $7.5
million offer for a tract in the High Island area off the
Texas-Louisiana coast. The bid came to $1,306.24 per acre.
   Officials of the Interior Department's Minerals Management
Service opened the bids as several hundred oil industry executives
looked on.
   It was the second offering of government-owned tracts in the
western gulf and the third gulf lease sale since the Interior
Department dropped the minimum per-acre price on the property from
$150 to $25.
   Interest was high, with 93 companies qualifying to bid.
Eighty-four qualified last March for a similar offering in the
central Gulf.
   However, when the number of submitted bids was totaled Tuesday
afternoon, it was far below the 931 bids received last March for
central Gulf properties.
   Eileen Angelico, spokeswoman for the Minerals Management
Service, said the number was down for two reasons.
   The central Gulf waters are considered better risks and the
western Gulf tracts were up for bids a year ago shortly after the
minimum bids were lowered to $25 per acre.
   Almost 520 bids were received on the first western Gulf
offerings.
   Almost 28 million acres of offshore property, mostly off the
Texas coast, were offered when the government announced the sale in
July. That property was divided into 5,080 tracts.

   The stock market closed with some spotty losses
today after an early advance faded.
   Stocks headed higher at the opening as the dollar climbed in
foreign exchange on reports suggesting that Japanese officials
planned no immediate move to increase interest rates.
   That, in turn, prompted slightly higher prices, and hence lower
interest rates, for U.S. government securities in the credit
markets.
   Analysts also said hopes were increasing on Wall Street that
Friday's report on the employment situation for August would show a
moderation in job growth, which would presumably ease pressure for
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   With all those positives, however, the pace of trading remained
relatively light as the long Labor Day weekend approached.
   Brokers said the market was still suffering from the apathy and
caution that has predominated in recent sessions.

<TEXT>
   The French publishing concern Hachette
SA has agreed to acquire a majority interest in the Spanish
publishing firm Salvat, the two companies announced Wednesday.
   Terms were not disclosed, although the Spanish domestic news
agency Europa Press said Hachette paid about $56.5 million for its
stake.
   The deal capped more than a year of negotations between Juan
Salvat, chairman of Salvat, and Jean Claude-Lattest, general
director of Hachette's books division. It is subject to approval by
Spanish regulators.
   The investment was viewed as a way for Hachette to increase its
presence in the Spanish-speaking world, including Spain and Latin
America.
   Hachette, one of the world's largest publishing and media
companies, has 26,000 employees in 36 countries.
   The Paris-based concern said its investment in Salvat and its
recent acquisition of Grolier Inc., a U.S.-based book publisher,
will make it one of the world's largest book publishers with annual
sales of about $1.1 billion.
   Salvat was founded more than 100 years ago in Barcelona and
employs about 1,500 people, including 500 in Spain and the rest in
15 other countries, mostly in Latin America. Its 1988 sales were
estimated at about $126 million.
   Salvat publishes dictionaries and encyclopedias, operates the
largest book distribution network in the Spanish-speaking world and
is involved in specialized medical publishing.
   In addition to books, Hachette publishes magazines and regional
newspapers, and has interests in broadcasting, television and film
production and outdoor display advertising.

   The stock market posted some scattered losses in
another sluggish session Wednesday after an early advance failed to
stand up.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points
soon after the opening, finished with a 6.58 loss at 2,031.65.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 693 up, 716

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 130.48 million

   Gould Inc. led the active list, down \ at 22\ on volume of more

Scientific-Atlanta said it knew of no explanation why its shares

   The dollar staged a strong advance Wednesday,
bolstered by a sharp decline in the Japanese yen.
   Gold prices also moved higher. Republic National Bank of New
York said gold was bid at $430.30 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
from $428.35 late Tuesday.
   The dollar's gains came at the expense of the yen, which
weakened anew in overseas trading after Bank of Japan officials
hinted they would not raise their discount rate despite recent
interest rate hikes in the United States and Europe.
   ``The yen went through the floor,'' said one dealer in London.
The dollar's gains against the yen encouraged it to climb against
other currencies, dealers said.
   In New York the dollar jumped 1.59 yen to close at 136.52 yen.
Earlier in London, the dollar rose to finish at 136.50 yen. In
Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the
dollar rose 0.58 yen to close at 134.97 yen.
   The yen began weakening late Tuesday on rumors that the Japanese
government plans to impose a tax on certain stock-trading profits.
   ``Stories are going around left and right about what the
Japanese may or may not do,'' said Robert Ryan, a senior trader at
Irving Trust Co.
   In domestic dealings, traders noted that the dollar closed off
its session highs. ``There was some profit-taking and some
month-end squaring'' of positions, noted Jesse Torres, chief dealer
at Bank of Boston's New York office.
   ``The dollar reached the stage where (West Germany's) Bundesbank
said it would do anything to defend the mark,'' he said, prompting
traders to sell dollars.
   The central banks did not intervene to halt the dollar's rise.
But dealers in Europe said they fear the Bundesbank will enter the
market if the dollar tops the 1.8800 level against the mark.
   The dollar gained against the British pound. In London it cost
$1.6830 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6910 late Tuesday. In New
York it cost $1.6860 to buy one pound, less expensive than
Tuesday's $1.6875.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.8765 West German marks, up from 1.8664; 1.5848 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5765; 6.3740 French francs, up from 6.3385;
1,394.50 Italian lire, up from 1,386.00, and 1.2392 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2362.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.8780 West German marks, up from 1.8678; 1.5828 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5760; 6.3755 French francs, up from 6.3385;
2.1230 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1080; 1,395.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,387.50, and 1.2395 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2386.
   Gold bullion for current delivery rose to $431.30 a troy ounce
on the New York Commodity Exchange, from $428.80 at Tuesday's close.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $429.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $428.10. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $429.50 an ounce, up from $428.50 late Tuesday. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold fell $2.60 per ounce to close at a bid $429.96.
   Silver bullion for current delivery rose to $6.556 a troy ounce
on the Commodity Exchange from $6.490 on Tuesday. Silver bullion
prices fell slightly in London, where the metal was trading at a
late bid price of $6.52 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $6.55.

<HEAD>Deadline Arrives For Rainfall Under Disputed Drought Insurance
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At Chubb Corp., summer ended at midnight
Wednesday, the cutoff for measuring rainfall under the insurer's
controversial drought coverage plan that has farmers suing,
insurance departments angry and Chubb officials struggling for
damage control.
   A spokeswoman at the Warren, N.J.-based company, who spoke on
condition that she not be identified by name, said several weeks
would be needed to determine the amount of Chubb's liability. The
insurer hopes to pay all claims by early October, she said.
   Reports from 1,100 U.S. Weather Measuring Stations will filter
in to Chubb's computer. Some of the stations are remote, making
collection of the data more difficult, she said.
   Chubb officials have said that recent rainfall after dry weeks
in June and July may have relieved it having to pay roughly half
the $40 million in coverage granted.
   ``It's certainly been raining, and it's substantially reduced
our exposure,'' said the spokeswoman.
   The policies, granted to 1,160 farmers, promise payments if
rainfall is less than half _ or less than 70 percent, depending on
the policy _ of an area's average rainfall from June 1 to Aug. 31.
   A check Wednesday with weather officials in Farm Belt states
showed a range of roughly calculated rainfall levels for the eriod,
though it is difficult to estimate what the effect might be on
Chubb's liability.
   In Iowa, about 15 percent of the state had less than half normal
rainfall; 55 percent to 60 percent received less than the 70
percent threshhold. Minnesota reported that less than 10 percent of
the state fell below the halfway mark and just under half had less
than 70 percent of the average.
   Rainfall in more than two-thirds of Indiana dipped below 70
percent of the average, and one-fifth was below 50 percent.
   In Illinois, more than half the state received less than 50
percent of normal rainfall from April 1 to Aug. 1, and nearly all
of it dipped below 70 percent. Twenty-two counties in the southeast
quarter of Nebraska alone received less than 70 percent of normal
rain since January. Figures since June were not available.
   Weather officials in Louisville, Ky., said rainfall was about 22
percent shy of normal for the June 1-Aug. 31 period, and that
conditions in the rest of the state appeared similar.
   The Chubb policy became embroiled in controversy when the
company was flooded with applications that exceeded the amount of
coverage it had authorized.
   Agents offered an estimated $400 million in insurance compared
to the $30 million limit, which Chubb later increased to $40
million. About 8,700 farmers applied. Angered over the disparity,
farmers sued Chubb and the cases were consolidated in a
class-action suit in federal court in Cincinnati.
   Insurance regulators in Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota and Iowa have
scheduled hearings on the issue.
   Chubb offered to return double the premiums paid by farmers who
were denied a policy, and has sent about 6,000 checks totaling $20
million, the spokeswoman said.
   Midnight Wednesday was also the deadline for farmers to have
letters postmarked asking for the doubled refunds.
   Lawyers for farmers in the Cincinnati case said an agreement
with Chubb lawyers was filed promising that the double payments
could be requested without forfeiting the right to sue.
   The Chubb spokeswoman said the promise was part of the company's
original refund offer. She also said the deadline would not be
extended.
   She said most of the applying farmers had been contacted by
telephone about the potential refund, but an unidentified numbers
of others could not be reached and had been written.
   Chubb has reacted to the image crisis created by the
controversey not just with the refunds but with full-page newspaper
ads, toll-free numbers and a special task force staffed by 125
people.
   The volume of phone calls Wednesday was not heavier than usual,
the company said.

   The Chicago Board Options Exchange and some of
its traders overcharged more than 1,000 investors who lost at least
$40 million the day after the stock market collapsed, a lawyer
charged Wednesday after filing a lawsuit.
   The CBOE and floor traders responsible for making markets in
certain options on the Standard & Poor's 100 stock index violated
federal law and the exchange's own rules by charging inflated
prices for options contracts last Oct. 20, attorney Herbert Beigel
alleged in a class-action lawsuit.
   ``The investors were gouged by virtue of being charged excessive
prices,'' Beigel, a partner in the Chicago-based law firm Beigel &
Sandler, said in a telephone interview from his New York office.
   ``The market makers, with the assistance of the CBOE,
deliberately charged investors very excessive prices, which made it
difficult for the investors to make money because there was not a
legitimate market.''
   CBOE officials were aware of the lawsuit, which consolidates
three previous class-action lawsuits, but would not comment on it,
said spokesman Warren Moulds.
   An option is a contract giving the holder the right to buy or
sell a commodity or financial instrument for a specific price at a
future date. In the case of S&P 100 index options, the item being
traded is the value of the S&P 100 index, which measures the
performance of 100 stocks.
   The price or premium of an index option depends on a number of
variables, including the time until the expiration of the option
and the volatility of the underlying index.
   The CBOE, the world's leading options exchange, has said the
doubling and tripling of index options prices on Oct. 20 were
understandable in light of the market's unprecedented volatility
that day.
   The exchange also facilitated the collection of $1.2 million
earmarked as refunds for investors who paid extremely high prices
for S&P 100 index options contracts on Oct. 20. The money was
collected from traders and distributed to brokerage firms.
   But Beigel said the refunds amounted to, at most, 20 percent of
the total lost by some investors.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Chicago,
combines and broadens the claims of the three previous lawsuits. It
seeks an amount equal to the money invested less any returns or
refunds, plus an unspecified amount for lost use of the money and
interest.
   It names as plaintiffs all people who purchased OEX- or
OEZ-series index options on Oct. 20 at the CBOE, except those who
acted as market makers for such transactions.
   The lawsuit names as defendants the CBOE; the Options Clearing
Corp., a separate firm that processes trades made at the exchange;
and all CBOE floor traders who were designated as market makers for
the OEX and OEZ series of S&P 100 index options on Oct. 20.
   Trading losses in index options on Oct. 19 and 20 have been
estimated at several hundred million dollars nationwide. Index
options were among the largest sources of investor complaints in
the weeks after the 508-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial
average on Oct. 19.
   Index options, which account for more than half the trading
volume at the CBOE, are hedging tools that investors use to protect
themselves against losses in the stock market.

   Joseph Coyne, a spokesman for the board, said no firm dates for
the trip have been established, nor has an itinerary been set.
   Greenspan is scheduled to attend the convention of the American
Bankers Association in Honolulu on Oct. 8-10.
   A spokesman for the Bank of Japan announced earlier Wednesday
chairman Satoshi Sumita had invited Greenspan to visit before the

   While Brian C. Beazer continues seeking buyers
for the chemical operations of his newly acquired Koppers Co., the
Pittsburgh company's engineering department Wednesday announced it
is breaking away as a consulting firm.
   ``We did begin studying this ... prior to Beazer being
successful'' in his takeover, said Anthony Foster, president of the
new ChemTech Consultants Inc. ``We then talked to Mr. Beazer about
the idea. He said it made perfect sense and was very supportive
from day one.''
   Beazer, chairman of a British construction and construction
materials business, prevailed over a reluctant Koppers management
in a hostile takeover, acquiring the Pittsburgh construction
materials and chemicals company for $1.8 billion on June 1.
   ChemTech will employ about 30 people, 18 of whom will be
investors.
   ``We're going to concentrate on the chemical industry and
continue to provide the same engineering services to Koppers that
we have historically done,'' Foster said.
   Leaner engineering departments in the nation's chemical
companies favor consultants like ChemTech, and the new firm's
specialties, which are process controls and electricity generation
from waste energy, are in demand in the industry, he said.
   ``We are equally enthusiastic with the formation of ChemTech,''
said Beazer, who has been seeking buyers for Koppers' chemical
business since a buyout by division managers collapsed a month ago.

<HEAD>Last Defendant In TRW Case Pleads Guilty To Mail Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former manager for TRW Inc. pleaded guilty
Wednesday to mail fraud, completing the government's procurement
fraud criminal case against the defense contractor, U.S. Attorney
Patrick McLaughlin said.
   Charles W. Broome, 64, of Gates Mills, former product line
manager of TRW's compresser components division, pleaded guilty in
U.S. District Court to participating in a scheme to defraud the
Department of Defense and General Electric Co., McLaughlin said.
   As part of a plea bargain, the government agreed to dismiss five
remaining counts and recommend probation in line with terms given
to two other defendants already sentenced, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Christian H. Stickan said.
   Two more co-defendants are awaiting sentencing. All five
co-defendants pleaded guilty.
   Broome will be sentenced after a report is filed with the court,
Stickan said. No date for sentencing was set. The maxiumum penalty
is a five years in prison and a $1,000 fine.
   The mail fraud charge involves the falsification of labor
expenses in the manufacture of the TF-39 fan blade used in the C-5A
military cargo plane, Stickan said.
   Last Thursday, TRW paid a $3 million penalty after pleading
guilty in U.S. District Court to three counts of conspiring to
overcharge the federal government for military aircraft and M-1
tank parts.
   Willliam Lawrence, TRW vice president and assistant secretary,
had waived the company's right to a trial and entered a guilty plea
for the company before Judge George W. White.
   Lawrence said the company also paid a separate $3 million to
increase to $11.8 million the amount paid toward restitution to the
government to settle a pending civil lawsuit. The total amount of
the required restitution will be determined in the suit.
   The company had estimated it overcharged the government between
$3 million and $11 million, Lawrence said. He said the compressor
components division was sold in 1986 as part of a restructuring
plan.

   Mark IV Industries said Wednesday it is
prepared to increase its tender offer for Armtek Corp. to an
indicated $568 million if the two sides can reach a satisfactory
merger agreement.
   Mark IV, which already owns nearly 15 percent of Armtek's
outstanding shares, is willing to increase its bid from $44 a share
to $46 a share. Based on Armtek's 12.35 million shares outstanding,
the higher offer is worth $568 million, up from $543 million.
   Mark IV Chairman Sal H. Alfiero said he proposed the increase
during a meeting Tuesday with Armtek Chairman Frank R. O'Keefe.
   Should Armtek decide it wants to conduct an auction of the
corporation, Mark IV informed the manufacturer of auto and
industrial parts and components that it would want to participate.
   An Armtek spokesman declined comment on the meeting and latest
proposal.
   Armtek's board, which earlier this year sold its Armstrong Tire
Co. to the Pirelli Group, was expected to meet this week to review
the offer.
   Mark IV, headquartered in West Amherst, N.Y., manufactures
aerospace and defense, professional audio and information, and

   Businesses could unite workers at
various locations in a telephone conference and create the illusion
they are in the same room with a ``video wall,'' Bellcore said
Wednesday in unveiling a prototype.
   Bellcore, a research concern formed after the breakup of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., said the video wall uses
``image merging'' techniques that bring together images generated
by multiple cameras. A final single image can be the product of
transmissions from several locations, said co-inventor Lanny Smoot.
   ``The wall is 8 feet wide for a panoramic view and people appear
to be lifelike,'' he said. ``It's as if you were looking through a
wall into an adjacent room.''
   Smoot said research has shown that workers who may share common
concerns or goals do not work together as well if they are in
separate buildings or even on different floors in the same building.
   The video wall could encourage people to work more closely
together, he said.
   Bellcore, which has headquarters in Livingston, developed the
wall at its research center in Morris Township.
   The research and engineering consortium serves the telephone
companies of the seven regional Bell holding companies.
   Smoot said it will be the companies' decision to market the
video wall as a service.
   Bellcore has applied for a patent involving the video merging
technique, he said.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Hit 12-Year Low On Threat To International Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices tumbled to a 12-year low Wednesday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange after an official of the
world's top cocoa-producing country said an international
price-support agreement was dying.
   On other markets, pork futures fell sharply; crop futures
gained; precious metals were higher; energy futures were lower; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   The shaky price-support agreement of the International Cocoa
Organization sustained another blow Wednesday when Denis Bra Kanon,
agriculture minister of the Ivory Coast, told representatives of
other producer nations he did not believe the ICCO would survive,
analysts said.
   The Ivory Coast, which produced 29 percent of the world's cocoa
last year, has been withholding its cocoa beans from the market in
hopes of selling them for higher prices.
   The Ivory Coast also owes about $48 million in cocoa levy fees
to the ICCO to support its operations.
   Bra Kanon's remarks Wednesday to a meeting of the Cocoa
Producers Alliance in Togo, had a profound impact on the cocoa
market, which had been looking forward to the ICCO's scheduled
two-week meeting beginning Sept. 5 in London. At that meeting,
consumer and producer nations are to begin negotiations toward a
new international cocoa price-support agreement.
   ``A lot of people who may have believed the price of cocoa might
rally because of the upcoming meeting were very demoralized,'' said
Arthur Stevenson, cocoa market analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   Because of the reluctance of the Ivory Coast and other producers
to pay levies, ``the ICCO is facing very, very severe financial
problems,'' he said. ``How are they going to enforce economic
provisions to support prices if they don't have the cash to keep
going?''
   In addition to those factors, a glut of cocoa is expected in the
upcoming marketing year, which begins Oct. 1.
   Cocoa settled $44 to $60 lower with the contract for delivery in
September at $1,220 per metric ton.
   Frozen pork-belly futures plunged the permitted 2-cents-a-pound
limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a third day of sharp
declines in the pork complex.
   Hog slaughters are increasing on a seasonal basis, and the
movement of hogs to market is being accelerated by the
earlier-than-normal maturation of corn and soybean crops, analysts
said.
   ``I have a feeling that producers are getting their pens cleaned
up and getting ready to turn their attention to the harvest here
pretty quick,'' said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with Agri-Visor
Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Most cattle futures moved lower on signs of slackening demand
for beef, he said.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .63 cent lower with October at
71.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with September at 81.70 cents a pound; hogs were .48 cent to
.95 cent lower with October at 38.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.42 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 48.90
cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished higher on the Chicago Board
of Trade on indications that a long-awaited increase in foreign
demand was beginning to surface, analysts said.
   Prices had opened lower and made little movement until midday,
following strong indications that East Germany had purchased
300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   The Agriculture Department said India purchased 250,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices while Mexico reportedly
bought 50,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with September at $3.97{
a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 6} cents higher with September at
$2.83 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with September
at $2.56{ a bushel; soybeans were 7{ cents to 14 cents higher with
September at $8.54{ a bushel.
   Platinum led the precious-metals complex higher in a bounce
inspired by technical factors, analysts said.
   Platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled $7.80 to
$8.10 higher with October at $533.90 a troy ounce. On New York's
Commodity Exchange, gold was $2.20 to $2.50 higher with October at
$434.10 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 6.6 cents higher with
September at $6.556 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures settled lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 9 cents to 28
cents lower with October at $15.18 a barrel; heating oil was .19
cent to .61 cent lower with September at 42.95 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .35 cent to 1.49 cents lower with September
at 46.54 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 1.10 points lower at 261.60.

<TEXT>
   American family income rose by 1 percent last
year but the number of people living in poverty also edged upward
slightly, the Census Bureau reported ednesday.
   ``The economic recovery is leaving many poor Americans behind,''
said Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a private research group.
   He said the most disturbing figures dealt with black Americans,
who suffered a significant increase in poverty. The government
defined the poverty income level as $11,611 for a family of four in
1987, up from $11,203 the previous year.
   William P. Butz, the Census Bureau's associate director for
demographic programs, said the nation's ``economic performance, in
terms of income and poverty, has been mixed'' as usual.
   The number of Americans living in poverty last year totaled 32.5
million, slightly higher than the 32.4 million reported for 1986.
The poverty rate was 13.5 percent, down from 13.6 percent.
   Butz said neither change is considered statistically significant
because they are within the margin of possible error in the report,
which was based on a sample of about 60,000 households across the
country.
   It is possible for the poverty rate to decline even when more
people are poor because the size of the population is growing
faster than the number of people living in poverty.
   Median family income last year was $30,850, up from $30,534 the
year before, the bureau said.
   The poverty report was likely to generate controversy in the
presidential election campaign because of its bad news for blacks.
   President Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said in
California that the report provides ``further evidence that the
most effective means of improving the life of Americans is a
strong, productive economy.''
   Fitzwater said the increase in poverty among blacks ``obviously
is disappointing,'' but that women were ``making the greatest
gains.''
   ``We think this is a good report,'' Fitzwater said. ``It
documents a decrease in poverty, a continuing rising income and
reflects a growing, strong economy.''
   Butz saw the figures somewhat differently.
   ``The poverty rate for blacks increased, but not for whites,''
Butz said. ``Income went up for whites, but not for blacks.'' But
Butz said it is premature to consider this a trend.
   The poverty rate for blacks increased from 31.1 percent in 1986
to 33.1 percent last year, the study said, meaning the number of
blacks living in poverty rose from 8.9 million to 9.7 million.
   Median family income for blacks fell from $18,247 to $18,098,
while the median income for white families rose from $31,935 to
$32,274.
   The poverty rate for whites dipped from 11 percent to 10.5
percent, indicating there were 21.4 million whites living in
poverty last year _ down from 22.2 million a year earlier.
   For Hispanics the poverty rate rose from 27.3 percent to 28.2
percent and median family income fell from $20,726 to $20,306. The
number of Hispanics in poverty rose from 5.1 million to 5.4 million.
   Median family income means half of all families receive more
than that amount and half less. Statisticians prefer medians as a
standard of comparison because a few families with extraordinarily
high incomes can distort an average.
   Hispanics cannot be counted in figures for blacks and whites
because Hispanics are an ethnic rather than a racial group and
already are included in figures for both blacks and whites,
officials said.
   Farmers got good news in the report. The farm poverty rate
plummeted from 19.6 percent in 1986 to 12.6 percent last year,
meaning the number of farm residents living in poverty declined
from 996,000 to 616,000.
   Butz said that while he had no immediate explanation for the
decline, but cautioned that the figures do not reflect the economic
hardships that farmers suffered because of this summer's widespread
drought.
   The study found that women's incomes continue to trail those of
men. It said women receive about 65 percent of males' take-home
pay, a percentage that has remain unchanged since 1984.
   Families headed by a female with no husband present had a
poverty rate of 34.3 percent, down slightly from 34.6 percent in
1986. Families headed by a man with no wife present had a poverty
rate of 12.5 percent, up from 11.4 percent the year before.
   Children under age 18 had a poverty rate of 20.0 percent, not
statistically different from the 19.8 percent of a year earlier.
The rate for persons 65 and older was 12.2 percent, down from 12.4
percent in 1986.
   Even so, children made up about 40 percent of the nation's poor
last year and the elderly accounted for 10.7 percent, meaning more
than half of all poor people were the oldest and youngest Americans.
   The report said the poorest 20 percent of Americans account for
only 4.6 percent if all income, a share that has declined from 5.5
percent in 1967.
   Over the same period, the wealthiest 20 percent increased their
share of all income from 40.4 percent to 43.7 percent.
   The 60 percent of people in the middle received 54.1 percent of
all income in 1967 and 51.7 percent last year.
   Butz said the poverty figures count only cash income, not
anti-poverty programs such as food stamps, subsidized housing and
Medicare. If those benefits counted as income, he said, the U.S.
povetry rate would decline to between 8 percent and 12.5 percent.

<TEXT>
   Carnival Cruise Lines, the world's largest cruise
line, announced agreement in principle Wednesday to buy 70 percent
interest in Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and Admiral Cruise Lines
for about $550 million cash.
   The announcement, issued jointly with Norway's Gotaas-Larsen
Shipping Corp., I.M. Skaugen A-S, Johnson Line AB and EFFOA-Finland
Steamship Co. Ltd., effectively doubles Carnival's initial 36
percent stake in Royal Caribbean and Admiral announced two weeks
ago.
   Under terms of the agreement, Carnival will buy all shares held
by Gotaas-Larsen, I.M. Skaugen, Johnson Line and EFFOA-Finland in
the Royal Caribbean and Admiral lines once a final sales agreement
has been reached and a mandatory federal waiting period has expired.
   Carnival President Micky Arison said no merger was planned of
the Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Admiral lines.
   ``They are three very different cultures,'' Arison said, ``and
we feel that operating three brands allows us to maximize our
return that way.''
   Carnival's planned purchase of Gotaas-Larsen's 36 percent stake
in the two lines was announced Aug. 17 at a price of $260 million.
   The expanded deal disclosed Wednesday adds the purchase by
Carnival of all I.M. Skaugen A-S, Johnson Line AB and EFFOA-Finland
Steamship Co. Ltd. holdings in Royal Caribbean and Admiral.
   Carnival operates seven ships sailing on three-, four- and
seven-day cruises to the Bahamas, Caribbean and Mexican Riviera.
The company also operates a casino in the Bahamas and is building a
luxury hotel at an adjacent site.
   Royal Caribbean operates primarily in the Caribbean, while
Admiral sails in both the Caribbean and the Pacific.

<HEAD>Honeywell To Sell Four Units Serving Military Markets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. said Wednesday it plans to
sell four units in its Space and Aviation Systems business, which
serve military markets.
   The units are its Electro-Optics Division in Lexington, Mass.;
Training and Control Systems Division in West Covina, Calif.;
Defense Communications and Production Division in Tampa, Fla., and
Signal Analysis Center in Annapolis, Md., Honeywell said in a
prepared statement.
   ``Our decision to sell these operations reflects Honeywell's
resolve to continue focusing on core businesses where we have a
competitive advantage to assure that we can achieve our goals,''
said James J. Renier, Honeywell president and chief executive
officer.
   ``The units we intend to sell are good businesses which happen
to fall outside the company's strategic focus,'' Renier said.
   In the space and aviation business, Honeywell is focusing on
three strategic core businesses in the commercial aviation,
military avionics and space markets, Renier said.
   ``This decision will allow us to concentrate on areas where we
have significant market shares and will reduce our exposure in
military markets where our competitive advantage isn't as strong,''
he said.
   In addition, Renier indicated proceeds from the sale of the four
units could be applied to the reduction of debt, investment in the
company's controls businesses, or the repurchase of stock.
   Honeywell said approximately 3,500 employees are employed at the
four units being sold.
   The divisions' combined sales were about $430 million in 1987,
or about 6 percent of the company's total sales of $6.7 billion.
Honeywell's space and aviation business sales totaled $1.9 billion
in 1987.
   Honeywell, an international control company that provides
products, systems and services for the home and building,
industrial, space and aviation, and defense and marine markets, has
79,000 employees worldwide.

<HEAD>TRW Announces Program To Repair Recalled Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ross Gear Division of TRW Inc. probably
will spend under $25 million repairing or replacing gears that have
been recalled on heavy-duty trucks, the company said Wednesday.
   In a news release, TRW said the division has agreed to pay for
removal, freight, repair and reinstallation of TAS 65 integral
steering gears. The division also will pay certain costs of towing
vehicles taken out of service by the recall and for some travel and
lodging costs incurred by truck drivers, TRW said.
   The gears have failed in eight instances, but no one has been
injured, TRW said. An estimated 27,000 gears have been recalled,
and about 20,000 already have been returned to TRW, the company
said.
   TRW Ross Gear has advised truck owners that the steering gear
shouldn't be used until it is replaced or repaired. Truck
manufacturers have notified operators of affected vehicles, the
division said.
   ``The company is applying its full resources to the problem,''
said Delmar O. Stanley, vice president and general manager of Ross
Gear. ``We are shipping replacement gears for the affected vehicles
at a rate of 2,000 per day.''

<HEAD>Fed Gives Three Foreign Firms OK To Run Banks On U.S. Territory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday granted
three foreign firms permission to acquire, start or maintain banks
on U.S. territory.
   The Bank of Tokyo Ltd. was given permission to acquire Union
Bank of Los Angeles by merging it into California First Bank, which
it already owns.
   California First is the sixth-largest commerical bank in the
state, with deposits of $4.7 billion. Union Bank is the
fifth-largest, with deposits of $7.8 billion. The two combined will
rank as fifth-largest.
   Bank of Toyko is the 22nd-largest bank in the world, with assets
of $183 billion.
   Board member Martha Seger, in a dissenting statement, said the
Japanese bank, because it is required by its government to have
less capital than is required in the United States, would have an
unfair advantage over U.S. institutions.
   In another action, the Fed approved an application from the Bank
of Seoul, the largest bank in South Korea and the 147th largest in
the world, to form Seoul Bank of California in Los Angeles.
   The board said the new bank would not have an adverse effect on
competition among banks in the Los Angeles area. Seger also opposed
the Seoul Bank application.
   The Fed also approved an application by Banco Bilbao-Vizcaya of
Spain to own Banco Comercial de Mayaguez in Puerto Rico. Banco
Bilbao-Vizcaya is being formed by the consolidation of two Spanish
institutions, one of which already owns the Puerto Rican bank.
   The merged bank, with $57.7 billion in assets, is the largest in
Spain. It already operates a branch in New York and agencies in
Miami and San Francisco. Banco Comercial is the seventh-largest
commercial bank in Puerto Rico.

<HEAD>Japanese Firm Seeking Controlling Stake In Chicago Futures
Brokerage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nomura Securities Inc., the world's largest
securities firm, is seeking a controlling interest in GNP
Commodities Inc., a mid-sized futures and options brokerage based
in Chicago, a GNP official said Wednesday.
   Brian Monieson, GNP's chief executive officer and one of its two
shareholders, said GNP had held preliminary discussions with the
Japanese firm.
   ``All we've done is that we are talking and we are continuing to
talk,'' he said. ``There's no agreement at all.''
   Control of GNP, an established trading firm with clearing status
on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange,
would give Nomura an edge over other Asian companies that are
moving into the U.S. futures and options markets.
   GNP's traders already have access to favorable positions in the
best trading pits, while newcomers often must start on the fringes.
   Membership on U.S. futures and options exchanges will allow
Japanese firms to use those instruments more easily to hedge
against adverse movements in stock and bond markets.
   The U.S. units of Daiwa Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities
Co. gained full clearing membership on the Chicago Board of Trade
two weeks ago. In April, the U.S. unit of Nikko Securities Co. was
the first Japanese-affiliated firm to become a CBOT clearing member.
   Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., a large Japanese commercial bank, has
purchased associate clearing status on the CBOT and membership in
the International Monetary Market division of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement Reached Between WPPSS, Bondholders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Washington Public Power Supply System has
settled its part of a securities fraud lawsuit brought by
bondholders after the system defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds
sold to finance two nuclear power plants, attorneys announced
Wednesday.
   Plaintiff bondholders would drop claims against WPPSS in return
for access to power plant accounts containing millions of dollars.
   Plaintiffs' attorneys also said the deal would gain them the
cooperation of WPPSS employees, who will be leading witnesses in
the trial set to start Sept. 7 in Tucson, Ariz.
   Remaining defendants include 20 public utilities in Washington
and one in Oregon, three engineering firms and a firm that had
provided WPPSS with financial advice.
   Attorneys reached the settlement, which had been proposed by the
plaintiffs, late Tuesday. The WPPSS Executive Board was expected to
approve the agreement at a special meeting Friday in Richland,
Wash., said Carl Halvorson, board chairman.
   ``It's a very favorable settlement for the supply system,'' he
said.
   The settlement also needs approval from U.S. District Judge
William D. Browning, who is presiding over the WPPSS default case.
   Under the tentative settlement, the plaintiff bondholders agreed
to dismiss all claims against WPPSS based on securities fraud,
misrepresentation and violation of state law.
   WPPSS in turn agreed it had an obligation to pay the face value
and interest on the bonds _ which would come to about $3 billion _
even though it paid no money in the settlement. The agreement also
noted that because of limited assets pledged to secure the bonds,
there was ``no expectation'' the money would ever be paid.
   However, the agreement did give bondholders unconditional access
to an account for the terminated plants, Nos. 4 and 5, which has
been under control of New York's Chemical Bank, the trustee for
plaintiff bondholders, since 1983.
   The account now has about $75 million in it and has withdrawn a
total of about $90 million, mostly for attorneys' fees.
   Other additional funds the bondholders might realize from the
settlement could come from a pending lawsuit seeking to wrest from
two other WPPSS projects funds that were spent when those plants
were ``twinned'' with the terminated projects. That could amount to
tens of millions of dollars, but a determination is years away.
   ``Since you can't get blood out of a turnip, why not get all the
other benefits you can,'' said Mel Weiss, who represents class
action plaintiffs in the giant lawsuit.
   The abrupt pullout of WPPSS from the litigation caught other
defendants by surprise, and one said defendants were considering
seeking a trial delay.
   ``We're surprised they (WPPSS) didn't stay and defend their
actions...,'' said Chuck Shigley, administrator for the Snohomish
County Public Utility District. ``It's not clear that we need more
time (to prepare for trial). There is a good chance we will be able
to pull it together.''
   In addition to access to funds, the settlement will allow
plaintiffs to talk with supply system employees before they are put
on the stand, according to Paul Bernstein, a plaintiffs' lawyer,
   Because of rules in a civil lawsuit, there were questions on
whether the WPPSS employees even would have to testify.
   Bondholders had sued the supply system, 88 utilities, bond
underwriters, various directors and managers, engineering firms and
advisors after WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion worth of bonds to
build the two never-completed nuclear power plants.
   Many defendants, including bond underwriters and more than 60
utilities, have reached settlements totaling $331 million over the
past year.

   The chairman and chief executive
officer of American Medical International Inc. has resigned under
pressure from four major stockholders and an interim successor has
been named, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   Directors accepted Walter L. Weisman's resignation on Tuesday.
Royce Diener, a sitting member of the board, was named interim
successor, American Medical spokesman Mick Taylor said Wednesday.
   The shuffle had been expected since Monday, when American
Medical, the nation's third-largest publicly held hospital concern,
said a committee of 13 of the 17 directors had recommended the
resignation of Weisman, 53. He had been chairman and chief
executive since September 1985.
   Bowing to the wishes of four large stockholders who are
dissatisfied with American Medical's languishing stock price, the
board committee reversed an earlier endorsement of Weisman.
   Diener, 70, is a former chairman of the company.
   The dissident shareholders, who together control about 30
percent of the company's stock, are Miami physician-businessman M.
Lee Pearce, Sid Bass and other members of his Fort Worth, Texas,
family, the Wedge Group investment concern in Houston, and former
Bass adviser Richard Rainwater.
