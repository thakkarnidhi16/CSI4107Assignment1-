   Soldiers used tractors Saturday to
excavate villages buried in mud and to search for survivors of
floods that killed more than 200 people, an official said.
   Four army helicopters brought food and medicine to villages in
Nakhon Sri Thammarat province that were cut off by the flooding,
said Saim Kaewsinual, a public relations official of the 4th Army
Region.
   By Saturday morning, authorities recovered the bodies of 217
people, mostly victims of mudslides that swept through the province
starting last Tuesday. Water levels have returned to normal in many
areas of the province, Saim said.
   He said about 500 soldiers helped in the rescue effort in Phipoon
district, where mud and logs crashed down hillsides, slamming into
houses and crushing people. The hills were barren because of
uncontrolled logging and mining, officials said.
   They said tens of thousands of people in 12 southern provinces
lost their homes in the flooding, which wrought extensive damage on
roads and crops.

   A rapist who has attacked two University of
Southern California students the last month has caused widespread
fear on campus, tempering the thrill of an undefeated football team
and a Heisman trophy-contending quarterback.
   ``It's something we're all thinking about,'' student body
President Phil Clement said this week. ``For many people, it's
paranoia. Students can't sleep, they're sick to their stomach.''
   A third sex attack occurred at 3:10 p.m. Friday on the USC
campus, but police Lt. Pete Durham said the rape was unrelated to
two other rapes reported this month. The attacker didn't resemble
the man in the other rapes, he said.
   The tension comes at a time when there should be joy at USC.
   The football team has earned a Rose Bowl berth and is undefeated
going into Saturday's showdown with undefeated Notre Dame.
Quarterback Rodney Peete, who led the team to victory last week over
rival UCLA despite a campus outbreak of measles that had put him in
the hospital, is a contender for college football's biggest prize,
the Heisman Trophy.
   Sgt. John Lewis of campus security said there have been four
campus-related rapes this year compared to one in 1987. The most
recent attacks, Oct. 29 and Nov. 5, are causing the fear.
   The rapist approached the female victims with a gun as they were
getting out of their cars at campus parking structures, then drove
them off campus and sexually assaulted them before driving them back
to the school.
   Police believe the same man was responsible for both attacks,
said Los Angeles Detective Dave Grabelski.
   ``There's a whole lot of fear over there. It's not being blown
out of proportion,'' Grabelski said Tuesday. ``The department
thought it important enough to take me and my partner off homicide.''
   USC has 30,000 graduate and undergraduate students who pay
$12,000 a year to attend classes on a 150-acre, inner-city campus.
Students traditionally have included the scions of many of Southern
California's oldest and wealthiest families.
   The private institution is also on the fringes of south-central
Los Angeles, home to a high crime rate and the city's most notorious
street gangs.
   That has led to the impression, even among students, that crime
is rampant on campus, when actually USC had fewer rapes, assaults
and burglaries last year than larger UCLA, which is bordered by
upscale Westwood and Beverly Hills, said Clement.
   Still, as many as 5,000 whistles have been distributed to women
students and some men in case they spot anything unusual, and campus
security has posted 24-hour guards at parking structures.
   A rape awareness seminar was held Nov. 7, and bulletins have been
posted urging caution. Students have been told to walk in pairs or
call the campus escort service.
   ``There is an increased fear, definitely,'' said student Gwen
Gallagher, 17. ``Last weekend was an increased risk time with the
UCLA game and all the parties.''
   ``I heard of cases where women were walking and if someone was
just walking behind them, they would scream,'' said student Kimberly
Falk, 19. ``We're using the buddy system. For the most part, though,
it's not panic.''
   ``There was more of a panic with the measles,'' she said.
   Some students are unhappy that at a time when they should be
enjoying football games and victory parties, they have to worry
about being attacked.
   ``I don't like feeling that I need to be watching everywhere I
go,'' said student Susan Han, 18.

<HEAD>Sakharov Calls Political Leaders, Public To Protect Embattled
Armenians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov urged
the Soviet government Friday to use military force to quell unrest
in the republic of Azerbaijan, where he said more than 130 ethnic
Armenians have died in rioting.
   ``The Soviet authorities must take the necessary measures to
insure the safety of the Armenian population, including their
introduction of sufficient troops in Azerbaijan for this purpose,''
Sakharov said in a statement read by his son-in-law, Efrem
Yankelevich.
   Soviet helicopters and trucks have been used in recent days to
aid hundreds of ethnic Armenians as they fled to their adjacent
homeland following the worst outbreak of violence since the first
days of ethnic disturbance in the Soviet south in February.
   Sakharov, who has been undergoing medical tests and visiting
relatives in the United States since Nov. 6, also charged the
official news media of incomplete and biased coverage to events in
the troubled region.
   ``With the authorities' connivance, the murders, rapes, and
arsons are continuing now for a fifth day and are spreading to other
cities and towns of Azerbaijan,'' Sakharov said.
   A curfew has been imposed and Soviet tanks and troops sent in
recent days to curb unrest in Kirovabad, Baku and Nakhivechan.
   Sakharov said he had had reports Azeri rioters, enflamed by
nationalist sentiment, had killed more than 130 Armenians and
wounded more than 200 in recent outbreaks of violence.
   The two ethnic groups, divided by religion, language and national
heritage, have a long history of ethnic rivalry. Armenians are
predominantly Christian and Azerbaijanis are predominantly Moslem.
   Sakharov urged nations to intervene and demand complete and
objective information about the situation, including free access to
both Armenia and Azerbaijan for Soviet and foreign journalists.
   Tensions have been running high in the Caucasus since February,
when Armenians began agitating for the annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijani officials and Soviet leaders have rejected the demand.
   In his statement, Sakharov urged officials to allow Armenians in
Nagorni-Karabakh to organize self-defense units, but also recomended
control of the disputed territory be placed temporarily under a
central, all-union administration.
   ``I appeal for support to political and public leaders, to my
scientific colleagues, to all people of goodwill,'' Sakharov said.
``I appeal to people of all nationalities.''

<TEXT>
   A woman who was misdiagnosed and kept in a state
mental hospital for 17 years has returned in triumph to the
institution as a full-time administrator after earning a master's
degree from Harvard.
   Marie Balter was 17 and clinically depressed when she was labeled
schizophrenic and sent to Danvers State Hospital. After gaining her
release in 1964, she went back to school and has since worked with
psychiatric patients, lectured nationwide and written an
autobiography. Her story was the basis of a 1986 TV movie starring
Marlo Thomas.
   Now Balter, 58, is devoting her efforts to helping improve the
hospital. She began work as community affairs director earlier this
month.
   ``I wouldn't have grown one bit if I didn't learn to forgive,''
she said in a recent interview. ``If you don't forgive your parents
or your children or yourself you don't get beyond that anger.
   ``Forgiving is a way of reaching out from a bad past and heading
out to a more positive future.''
   Marvin M. McNally hired Balter three months into his tenure as
Danvers' chief operating officer.
   ``She is a model for many people,'' he said. ``I think she serves
in that way for many people _ not just ex-patients. She has faced
adversity, has overcome it and has succeeded.''
   Balter was born in Boston, the illegitimate daughter of an
alcoholic mother who put her in a foster home at age 5. She was
adopted by a couple in Gloucester who disciplined her harshly,
sometimes locking her in the cellar.
   Increasingly depressed, she was institutionalized in 1947. Her
symptoms included muscle spasms, choking, hyperventilation and
hallucinations. She later learned she suffered from a form of
depression and panic disorder, not schizophrenia.
   ``It wasn't deliberate on the part of the doctors and the
hospital,'' she said. ``Not much was known about panic disorders
back then. A person who had panic disorders was identified as a
little bit crazy.''
   Her recovery was painful and gradual, as Balter overcame a
despair that often left her unable to eat or move. She contemplated
suicide more than once.
   With the help of friends, mental health workers and her own
strength and Catholic faith, Balter gained release in 1964. She
moved into an apartment, married and earned a psychology degree from
Salem State College and a master's from Harvard in administration,
planning and public policy.
   In her new job, which pays between $35,000 and $47,000, Balter
will serve as chief hospital spokeswoman, help train health workers,
recruit volunteers, find grants and assist in fund-raising _
``things that will help the hospital turn around,'' she said.
   Above all, Balter hopes to improve patient conditions, from
adding curtains to reducing overcrowding. Danvers has about 260
patients, twice its recommended capacity.
   This isn't Balter's first return to the hospital in Danvers, a
suburb north of Boston; from 1976 to 1979 she was a social worker on
community outreach cases and has run a mental health program linked
with Danvers.
   Balter has lectured nationwide since ``Nobody's Child'' aired on
network television two years ago. Her book, ``Sing No Sad Songs,''
was finished last year and she has marketed it herself to raise
money for the Balter Institute, a non-profit community mental health
training center.
   She plans to continue taking her message of hope, self-reliance
and caring to high schools, community groups and mental health
organizations.
   ``I don't believe on focusing on all the bad stuff that might
have happened,'' Balter said. ``Everybody has problems. Life is not
trouble-free. I try to make people see that.''
   To prove her point, Balter mentions tragedies from her own life _
a 10-year battle with cancer and the deaths of her husband, brother
and biological mother, who died in a fire two years after Balter met
her.
   ``I always believe that suffering pain is not a negative force in
our lives,'' she said. ``We take our pain and tragedy and use them
to serve others, and then they become positive tools to achieve our
goals.''

<HEAD>Tobacco Industry Holds Home-Turf Advantage In Kentucky's Smoking
Battles</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite moves elsewhere to restrict
smoking, the tobacco industry holds a powerful home-turf advantage
in Kentucky, where efforts to spell out non-smokers' rights have
taken a pounding.
   The latest target for the industry and its allies in the
Legislature is a proposed smoking policy at the University of
Louisville. Some key lawmakers have hinted the school may be hit in
the pocketbook if it grants certain rights to non-smokers.
   In June, the Owensboro City Commission rescinded a newly enacted
ban on smoking in municipal buildings after a tobacco company
threatened to reconsider plans to expand a plant there.
   Last year, the heat was on officials of the Greater Cincinnati
International Airport in northern Kentucky. Some lawmakers
threatened to revoke the airport's Sunday liquor license if a
smoking ban was fully implemented there.
   ``Tobacco is such an ingrained part of the social, economic and
political structure of this entire state, it's hard for people from
non-tobacco states to understand,'' said Mike Staufacker, health
education director for the American Lung Association of Kentucky.
   ``I'm a little bit embarrassed by what the state legislators are
trying to do,'' he said. ``It really sheds a poor light on the
state.''
   In North Carolina, the nation's leading tobacco grower, there
have been few moves to legislate restrictions on smoking, although
some bus companies and restaurants have instituted no-smoking
sections. In September, the Research Triangle Institute won a $4
million National Cancer Institute contract for a study in Raleigh
and Greensboro that will use advertising and community support to
get smokers to quit.
   Kentucky, the nation's top burley tobacco producer, had the
country's highest smoking-related death rate in 1985, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control reported last week. Staufacker said
another recent study showed 32 percent of all Kentuckians smoke, the
highest rate among 30 states surveyed.
   The chairman of the Legislature's Tobacco Task Force, Rep. Donnie
Gedling, said that total income from tobacco in Kentucky was $2.3
billion in 1984 and that the crop is a mainstay for many of the
state's 120,000 small farmers.
   ``We're talking about a $2 billion industry out here,'' said
state Rep. Clay Crupper, an opponent of smoking regulations and
chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. ``We ought not to be
out stopping smoking here and stopping smoking there.''
   Crupper is among several lawmakers angry about the University of
Louisville's proposed smoking regulations, especially a portion that
says in the case of an impasse between smokers and non-smokers,
non-smokers' rights prevail.
   The rules would prohibit smoking in hallways and common areas,
divide eating areas into smoking and non-smoking sections and
regulate smoking in offices on the urban campus, where 22,000
students are enrolled.
   Crupper said last week the Legislature ``might have to cut
something out'' of the school's budget if no compromise is reached.
Another alternative would be to enact legislation barring
universities from regulating smoking in state-owned buildings,
Crupper said.
   Donald Hall, a university spokesman, told a meeting of the
Tobacco Task Force on Nov. 20 that he understood the legislators
``loud and clear.'' Hall said later that Donald Swain, the
university president, was considering changes in the proposed
smoking policy.
   ``There is a sense that the present draft may be skewed a little
more toward the non-smoker than the smoker,'' Hall said. ``So, we
are trying to develop some language that is a little more
even-handed.''
   Hall said he doubted the university would back down completely
but probably would amend the provisions governing deadlocks in
disputes over smoking zones. He said he did not believe the school's
budget had been seriously threatened.
   ``I guess the intensity of the reaction from some quarters was a
little surprising,'' Hall said. ``But we know how important the
tobacco industry is to the state, and we certainly do not want to
get into a conflict with the General Assembly.''
   Many Louisville students said they resented the threats to the
budget.
   ``The tobacco industry is pulling the strings, and the University
of Louisville is dancing,'' said Gregory Hall, a non-smoking
political science major.
   John Jaynes, a graduate student who smokes, said he thought the
proposed policy would be overly restrictive but that legislators'
threats were ``petty'' and ``vindictive.''
   Brett Edwards, whose relatives raise tobacco near Bloomfield
southeast of Louisville, said he opposed the policy and supported
whatever steps were necessary to block the measure.
   ``You have to protect your business interests any way you can,''
Edwards said, taking quick puffs from a cigarette.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Marines shot at an armed intruder on the
outskirts of Howard Air Base near the Panama Canal, but the man got
away, apparently unhurt, a U.S. military spokesman said.
   Southern Command spokesman Bill Orsmbee said Marines guarding
base fuel tanks Wednesday morning fired twice after the man failed
to obey orders to halt.
   Orsmbee, who spoke Thursday, said he had no other information on
the incident.
   It was the sixth time Marines have fired at intruders, none of
whom have been wounded, captured or identified. The Marines shot and
killed one of their own men in an April incident.
   Marines have been stationed in Panama since April, shortly after
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega forced out President Eric Artuo
Delvalle. Noriega, chief of the Defense Forces and Panama's de facto
ruler, has been indicted in the United States on charges of drug
trafficking. He denies the charges.
   Noriega said in a speech Thursday at the Rio Hato military base,
90 miles from the capital of Panama City, that the military supports
a move toward greater democracy but that the country does not need
the U.S. Embassy's help.
   ``We are committed to holding elections in May 1989,'' he said.
``There are no changes in the election calendar nor in the
Panamanian democratic process. Holding elections is 1989 is a
Panamanian decision. ... It is not based on a foreign order.''
   Noriega said every time Panamanians have proposed initiatives to
solve the country's crisis ``a gringo comes along to torpedo,
impede, block, terminate or liquidate the initiatives.''
   ``It is time for Panamanians to sit down to dialogue without the
eraser of (the U.S. Embassy's political attache John) Maisto and for
them to realize that the Defense Forces would be part of the total
picture, but not the complete dialogue,'' he said.
   Noriega has resisted U.S. economic and political pressure to
resign and leave the country. He also has resisted internal
opposition pressure to step down as military commander.
   Noriega said, ``Panama should strengthen its political neutrality
and relations with all countries of the world and continue a
permanent effort to find a peaceful solution to conflicts.''
   He said Panamanians have learned that the economic system ``can't
continue depending on the political whims tied to international
interests.''
   Noriega said political forces should propose a new plan to
include ``economic pluralism in which the state, along with private
enterprise cooperatives and other economic organizations, would take
responsibility for guaranteeing various forms of initiatives to
contribute to development.''

   The historic steamer SS Clipper is taking
Chicagoans on a trip down memory lane while floating peacefully at
its new mooring in the heart of downtown.
   ``It's beautiful,'' said one nostalgic passer-by, Robert Love of
Chicago, as he admired the ship in its new setting on the Chicago
River.
   ``I remember when you had boats like this parked up and down the
river all the time. Bring back the good old days,'' Love said.
   The 83-year-old vessel sidled up to the Chicago Sun-Times
building Wednesday with the help of a couple of tugboats. It was
evicted from its eight-year spot at Navy Pier because of a rent
dispute with the city.
   ``Isn't she a sight, sitting there,'' asked James Gillan,
president of the Illinois Steamship Co., which owns the recently
designated National Historic Landmark and hopes to restore it to its
former splendor.
   The Clipper will spend the winter moored by the Sun-Times
building.
   ``In the last year, the outlook for the Clipper at Navy Pier just
got worse,'' Gillan said. ``Our best time in the city was when (the
late Harold) Washington was mayor. He really loved this boat.''
   One of Washington's last staff parties was held on the Clipper,
whose restored art deco restaurant, lounges and ballroom have been
the site of numerous social events in recent years, Gillan said.
   Though it won't be open to the public in coming months, Gillan
said he hopes the Clipper will again be the setting for social
events next fall.
   The 361-foot ship was once one of the proud steamships of the
Great Lakes. Originally christened the SS Juniata, it carried up to
900 passengers in elegant style on nine-day cruises from Buffalo,
N.Y., to Duluth, Minn.
   In 1941, the ship was rechristened the Milwaukee Clipper and
began ferrying passengers and autos from Milwaukee to Muskegon,
Mich., a six-hour trip taken by as many as 150,000 people each
season.
   It was taken out of service in 1970 and moved to Chicago in 1980.
   Long-range plans for the ship, according to Gillan, are to make
it seaworthy again and start cruises on Lake Michigan.
   ``There is no reason it could not set sail again,'' he said. But
an estimated $3 million to $5 million would be required.
   In the meantime, Gillan said he hoped the vessel would be a
pretty addition to the riverfront, especially at the mooring next to
the Sun-Times building, itself designed to look like an abstract
river barge.
   ``We'll try to make her attrative to have around,'' Gillan said.
``Wait till you see her at night, with all her lights on. That will
be a sight to see.''

<HEAD>Rodin-Sculpted Mask Stolen From Museum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   No trace has been found of a gunman who
handcuffed three museum guards and made off with a 10\-inch tall
bronze mask by French sculptor Auguste Rodin, police said Thursday.
   The gunman fired a warning shot and handcuffed the guards
Wednesday evening before fleeing the Rodin Museum in downtown
Philadelphia with the 19th-century sculpture, Man With the Broken
Nose, police said.
   The theft was the third at a Philadelphia museum in the past two
weeks.
   Detective John McNamee said Thursday officers were trying to find
a woman who had left the museum just before the robbery occurred.
``One of the guards saw her out there. We don't think she was
involved at all,'' McNamee said.
   The mask is valued at more than $75,000, according to John
Erickson, head of museum security. The robber was described as a
white man in his early to mid-20s, wearing jeans, white sneakers and
a long, gray tweed overcoat.

   Laboratory experiments announced today show
that a plant toxin combined with a synthetic protein is able to
attack and kill cells infected with the AIDS virus while leaving
healthy cells untouched.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, a group of
researchers report that a manmade molecule called recombinant CD4
can be used to deliver a killer toxin to cells infected with AIDS in
test-tube experiments.
   However, they cautioned that the new laboratory development _
like other incremental advances in AIDS research _ was far from
being ready for clinical application and, at best, might offer a
potential new treatment approach rather than a cure.
   Dr. Jonathan W. Uhr, chairman of the department of microbiology
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas,
said the CD4 molecule naturally binds to a gycoprotein, called
gp120, that forms on the surface of cells infected with human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. CD4, he said,
will not attach itself to cells not infected with HIV.
   In the laboratory, Uhr said, his research group combined a
synthetic CD4 molecule with a toxin called ricin that is extracted
from plants.
   When exposed in a test tube to HIV-infected cells, he said, the
CD4-ricin combination binds to the cell surfaces and the ricin then
kills the cell, thus eliminating a source of HIV virus.
   ``Early in the course of HIV infection, T-cells and macrophages
(two types of immunity cells) are thought to be the major cellular
reservoirs for the virus. Both of those bear the CD4 molecule that
permits the virus to enter,'' said Uhr.
   By combining a toxin with the CD4 molecule, the researchers are,
in effect, creating a guided missile that attacks only those cells
that are infected. Healthy cells are not touched by the toxin, said
Uhr.
   The scientist said toxic effects of the CD4-ricin combination
will have to be studied in the laboratory before the technique could
be used in clinical experiments. Ricin has been used in cancer drugs
and has been found to be well tolerated by patients if managed
carefully, he said.
   Uhr said it will be at least a year before the drug could be
tested on patients. And, though this technique shows promise, he
said he is not suggesting that it would cure AIDS.
   ``We would not expect it to kill a latently-infected cell and
this represents a significant obstacle in terms of curing this
disease,'' said Uhr. ``I think that one might expect, at best, to
slow it down.''
   He said the AIDS virus is known to invade cells and stay there
quietly, not making the gp120 protein that would be targeted by the
CD4 molecule.
   ``One would have to consider the problem of these latent infected
cells as a major one in terms of ridding the body of all the
infected cells,'' said Uhr.
   Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal, a National Institutes of Health AIDS
researcher, said the finding was ``important'' but added, ``we could
never eliminate the virus infection by this means'' because of the
latently infected cells.
   ``It still very early to say if this would be an important
therapy, but it should be tried clinically, I think,'' said
Wong-Staal.
   Other scientists involved in the study were Mark A. Till, Victor
Ghetie and Ellen S. Vitetta of the University of Texas, and Timothy
Gregory, Eric J. Patzer, James P. Porter and Daniel J. Capon of
Genentech, a South San Francisco, Calif., firm that developed the
synthetic CD4 molecule.
   A report on the study was published today in Science, the journal
of the American Association For the Advancement of Science.

   Some background on the ethnic unrest between Armenia and
Azerbaijan:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CAUSE _ A territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, an area
about the size of Delaware that was assigned to Azerbaijan in 1923.
The territory's population in the 1979 Soviet census was 162,000, of
whom 76 percent were ethnic Armenians and 23 percent ethnic
Azerbaijanis. Nagorno-Karabakh is surrounded by Azerbaijani
territory and has no border with the neighboring republic of
Armenia. It is officially known as the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous
Region of Azerbaijan.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TACTICS _ Beginning in February 1988, Armenians held general
strikes and mass demonstrations demanding that the territory be
annexed to Armenia. The Nagorno-Karabakh legislature requested the
transfer and Armenia's legislature agreed, but the Azerbaijani
leadership refused consent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EFFECTS _ The strikes cost millions of rubles in lost production.
The dispute led to a riot Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait
that killed 32 people, including 26 Armenians, and to the current
violence.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GOAL OF THE ANNEXATION MOVEMENT _ Armenians, most them
Christians, allege discrimination against ethnic Armenians under the
rule of Azerbaijanis, a predominantly Moslem ethnic group.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KREMLIN RESPONSE _ The Presidium, executive body of the national
parliament, rejected the annexation demand and instead approved an
aid package and other measures to improve cultural and social
conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh.

<TEXT>
   In this fishing port that may be the
site of the next summer White House, rumors are flying as thick as
herring gulls over a dragger's stern.
   One rumor has it that Ocean Avenue, the winding road that skirts
President-elect George Bush's oceanfront estate, will be made
one-way to ease the flow of traffic and enhance security. Others
suggest the road will be closed to the public and that passes will
be issued to townspeople who live along the route.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, were spending the Thanksgiving
holiday at the family estate.
   Rumors are about all the town's residents have to work with as
they swap ideas about what may happen to their quaint but growing
coastal village once Bush takes office Jan. 20.
   There is scuttlebutt that lobster fishermen may be barred from
setting their traps in the protected cove beside the
president-elect's 11-acre compound at Walker's Point. Bush has made
it plain that he opposes any such restrictions.
   Other unsubstantiated rumors tell of property sold or leased at
exorbitant prices to news organizations seeking an operational base
near the Bush estate.
   Making their way through the grapevine are rumors that a
half-dozen helicopter pads will be built at various points in town
to speed Bush's trips to and from his estate known as Walker's
Point, after his grandfather who built it.
   Some of the speculation is just plain fun.
   ``The last rumor I heard is that they're going to land the
aircraft carrier Nimitz out there to bring him in,'' said Bush's
closest neighbor, Robert Dennis, pointing to the ocean beyond
Walker's Point.
   The Secret Service, in accordance with long-established policy,
would not comment on any rumors or offer any details about security
arrangements for the Kennebunkport compound.
   ``The more we say about it, the more we legitimize what the
rumors are, and we hate to do that,'' said special agent Bill
Corbett, a spokesman at Secret Service headquarters in Washington.
   Emphasizing that no decisions have been made, Corbett said
``right now we're just monitoring what the president-elect's
schedule might be for the foreseeable future.''
   The Kennebunkport compound is more accessible to the public than
other presidential retreats such as President Reagan's mountaintop
ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif., but Corbett indicated the location
should not pose insurmountable security problems.
   ``Key Biscayne was on the ocean,'' he said, referring to Richard
Nixon's Florida hideaway, ``so it's not something that's totally new
to us.''
   The Secret Service has been protecting Bush for eight years as
vice president and is familiar with the Kennebunkport area, the
agent added.
   Bush's nine-bedroom home, situated on an 11.3-acre site that juts
into the ocean, is clearly visible from both Ocean Avenue and the
sea. Despite the colder weather, there has been a steady flow of
cars whose drivers slow down as they pass Dennis' house to catch a
glimpse of the Bush compound.
   Townspeople seem to be responding to the rumor mill with a
healthy skepticism. Said Dennis: ``Right now, nobody knows
anything.''

<TEXT>
   One year after he was found
wandering the streets of Ciudad Juarez, partially deaf and unable to
speak, 9-year-old Jose de Jesus Garcia Aguilera is attending school
for the first time.
   Jose's identity remained a mystery for months, but now
authorities say special education classes are unlocking a very sharp
mind.
   ``In one day, I swear, he learned the whole alphabet in sign
language,'' said Gloria Ferrel, a staff psychologist at the Casa
Hogar del Nino, a government-run children's home where Jose now
lives.
   Sometime in October, Jose, a spunky, streetwise kid, fled the
crowded two-room hut and meager meals he had shared with his mother,
grandmother and four siblings in Tampico, a port city on the Gulf of
Mexico.
   He was found Nov. 7, 1987, wandering the streets of Ciudad
Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, 700 miles from home.
Social workers spent eight months trying to learn his identity, but
Jose could communicate only through gestures, pictures and his
crooked-toothed grin.
   ``He's very sharp. He's always been able to communicate in one
way or another,'' Cecilia Villarreal, Casa Hogar director, said in
an interview this week at the home.
   The mystery was solved in June when his mother, Micaela Aguilera,
learned where he was. Aguilera, a poor barmaid with an estranged
common law husband, turned her son over to the Casa Hogar in Ciudad
Victoria, capital of the state of Tamaulipas, about 130 miles from
Tampico.
   Jose now lives with 120 other children ranging in age from
newborn to 15, and his mother has visited several times, officials
said.
   The small campus with spotlessly clean dormitories, a dining
hall, classrooms and a large garden is one of four homes in the
state and dozens around the country for abandoned, mistreated and
needy children.
   Jose started classes at a special education school in September.
Although he has a lot of catching up to do, he seems unfazed by the
burden of learning to spell, count and communicate through sign
language at the same time.
   ``He's learning very fast,'' said Patricia Franco, a staff
teacher who helps Jose practice his sign language.
   Jose, wearing new corduroy pants, a sports shirt and tennis shoes
and carting a big blue book bag, charged into the office to greet a
visitor and show off his new knowledge.
   He spelled his name in sign language, then flashed the signs for
desk, glass and book as Franco pointed to the objects.
   That accomplished, he grinned at his instructor for approval.
   Numbers still confound him, though. When Franco pointed to three
cups on the table, Jose wrote the number eight in a notebook.
   Jose drew many pictures of an airplane in flames during his stay
in Ciudad Juarez, leading authorities to speculate that he had
survived a plane crash.
   Specialists now say those pictures reveal a very active
imagination fueled by television and the fact that his home in
Tampico is next to an airport.
   But Jose is sticking to his story, using new skills to tell of
his odyssey.
   When Franco used sign language to ask where he comes from, Jose
attempted to sign a lavish story about how he'd crossed the
mountains and flown in an airplane.
   ``It's crude,'' she said. ``But he's telling us he's been
traveling, that he's been on an airplane.''
   Villarreal said Jose is still being tested. His deafness is
considered quite severe. A hearing aid didn't help, and authorities
are awaiting another.
   Plans call for Jose to see a specialist in Los Angeles for more
tests and to determine if an operation could correct his hearing
loss.
   Jose still is difficult to discipline because he has always
fended for himself, Villarreal said.
   ``He could easily have escaped, and he's had a lot of
opportunities,'' said Villarreal. ``But he seems happy here.''

<HEAD>Reagan Directive Assigns Roles For Agencies During Nuclear War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the event of a nuclear war, the Interior
Department would try to keep the nation's mines open and the
Education Department would seek out teachers to reopen schools,
according to a new order signed by President Reagan.
   Not surprisingly, the lion's share of the responsibility for
responding to nuclear attack is assigned to the Pentagon, according
to the recently released directive.
   The order overhauls a 19-year-old executive directive that was
first approved by President Nixon, said Russell Clanahan, a
spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   The new 27-page document brings up to date the 1969 order by
taking into account a number of changes in the structure of the
federal bureaucracy since then.
   For example, the old Department of Health, Education and Welfare
has been split into two Cabinet agencies: the Department of Health
and Human Services and the Department of Education.
   The 1969 order had been updated periodically but never totally
rewritten until now, Clanahan said. The job took several years.
   ``It had to go around the government several times for
coordination,'' he said. ``It did take quite awhile. You'd be amazed
at the amount of nit-picking the bureaucracy can do.''
   The order covers 26 federal agencies, including FEMA, the office
charged with coordinating the government's response to a wide
variety of disasters, including atomic war.
   The new document does not propose spending any more money for
civil defense, nor does it propose changing any policies.
   When he took office in 1981, Reagan began a large build-up of
military forces, including a variety of nuclear arms, and
administration officials also proposed increasing the nation's civil
defense effort. They said the Soviets have a much larger civil
defense system.
   Critics charged that the administration was pursuing a policy
based on the belief that a nuclear war could be fought and won. The
administration denied this.
   The latest executive order sidesteps that controversy, noting
only that ``the policy of the United States is to have sufficient
capabilities at all levels of government to meet essential defense
and civilian needs during any national security emergency.''
   Most of the emergency tasks assigned in the Reagan order are
meant to fit the federal agencies' areas of expertise. The Labor
Department, for example, is to ensure ``effective use of civilian
work forces resources in national security emergencies.''
   The Pentagon was given several tasks in addition to its role of
maintaining the necessary military forces. For example, it is
expected to ensure an adequate supply of drinking water, keep
waterways and harbors open, help the Justice Department enforce
civilian laws and coordinate the efforts of the government and
private industry.

   With thousands of ``stick children'' starving
in civil war-torn Sudan, the United States should be speaking out
against the atrocities rather than preserving its ties to the
Sudanese government, congressional and relief officials say.
   The State Department contends it is doing the best it can in
dealing with an ineffectual and stubborn government and the
complexities of a cruel civil war pitting the Moslem rulers in the
north against the Christian and pagan minority in the south.
   Both the State Department and relief officials agree that the
government and the rebels are using available supplies of donated
food as a weapon against millions of innocent civilians, but
opinions differ on how best to handle the crisis.
   ``The administration is suffering from a severe case of
clientelism,'' said Stephen Morrison, one of four congressional
staffers just back from a bipartisan fact-finding mission to Sudan.
   In the southern town of Abiye, where the United States was able
to arrange a food airlift a few weeks ago after months of pressure
on the Khartoum government, there are no children under three years
old, the staffers and relief officials said.
   ``They've all died of hunger or been sold for food,'' said
Jeffrey Clark, who coordinated the trip on behalf of Rep. Mickey
Leland, D-Tex., chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger.
``We saw stick children, their arms barely two inches in diameter,''
he added.
   Roger Winter, director of the privately funded U.S. Committee For
Refugees, said he had been urging the State Department to take a
stronger stand with the Khartoum government.
   ``A high profile U.S. leadership role is critical at this
point,'' he said, to get a massive relief effort under way.
   In response, the State Department issued a statement saying ``a
major human catastrophe continues to unfold in the Sudan. The world
is witnessing famine that is the result not of nature but of endemic
civil war.''
   The department also said its main objective is to get a massive
relief effort under way but added that ``we're dealing with a very
complex political situation and a government that has serious
problems coordinating its activities and exerting authority beyond
Khartoum.''
   The congressional staffers who were in Sudan said the U.S.
government does have leverage it could apply, if it chose to do so.
They noted that Washington grants $70 million a year in direct food
and other humanitarian aid. They said a grain pricing agreement up
for review between the two countries could also be used to exert
pressure.
   In addition, the United States has a controlling interest in the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund, on which Sudan relies
for substantial loans.
   ``And while some may not think we have much leverage, we do have
a megaphone,'' said David Lonie, a staffer on the House Human Rights
and International Organizations subcommittee. ``We cannot morally
condone this horror by our silence.''
   At a briefing for fellow staffers and non-governmental relief
agency heads, the four who went to Sudan described what they said
was a deliberate Sudanese government plan to ``de-populate'' the
south, where the rebel Sudan's People's Liberation Army has been
seeking social and religious reform since 1983.
   In recent years, some two million southerners have been driven
from their homes: about 350,000 have trekked across the border to
Marxist Ethiopia; the rest have gone north in search of food,
sometimes walking for three months sustained only by roots and
insects until they reach camps around Khartoum, the capital.
   World Vision, a California-based Christian relief agency which
operated in Sudan for 16 years until its expulsion last February,
estimates that 300,000 children perished this year from hunger and
war in Africa's largest country.
   Relief convoys and airlifts supplied by international donors and
neighboring Kenya and Uganda have been attacked by both sides or
prevented by government bureaucracy or harassment from reaching
their destination.
   On their way north, refugees are attacked by government-armed
Moslem tribal groups who rape and kill, the staffers said. Those who
remain in the south are in danger of bombardment by Soviet-made
MiG-23's sent by neighboring Libya to help the Sudanese government
of Sadek el-Mahdi, they added.

<HEAD>Mideast Remains Top Market For American Arms Exporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Middle East remained the No. 1 market for
American arms manufacturers last year, although total U.S. arms
exports fell sharply, according to a new study.
   The report also said McDonnell Douglas Corp. was one of the few
major defense contractors to post a sales increase for the year. The
St. Louis-based company assumed the top industry position with sales
of $657 million.
   The value of contracts awarded to U.S. defense contractors for
military equipment and services earmarked for export abroad fell to
$4.9 billion _ off 22 percent from the 1986 level and 44 percent
below 1985's total, the report said.
   The study examined sales in the 12-month period ended Sept. 30.
   ``The overall decline in Foreign Military Sale awards led to a
drop in the level of arms export business for 17 of the top 25 U.S.
arms exporting companies in 1987,'' the report said.
   The study was conducted by the Investor Responsibility Research
Center, which bills itself as a non-partisan research organization
dedicated to conducting impartial studies on public policy issues
involving corporate America.
   The group has been analyzing foreign arms sales for several
years, focusing on the official Foreign Military Sale, or FMS,
transactions, that are arranged and overseen by the U.S. government.
FMS sales account for about 84 percent of all U.S. arms exports; the
remainder normally involved company-to-country agreements.
   The research center waits until complete government tabulations
are available for each fiscal year, meaning there normally is a lag
of more than a year. The latest report was mailed out this week.
   Center officials attributed the steep decline in U.S. overseas
sales to a small drop in overall demand coupled with an increase in
competition.
   ``The biggest reason for the dropoff has to do with
competition,'' said Paul Ferrari, a center spokesman. ``It's a
tighter market out there.
   ``It's still a good business, but a lot of the oil-rich countries
and developing nations either don't have the funds anymore, or they
have stocked their arsenals to the brim for the time being.
   ``And the demand is slackening off a little bit at the same time
there are more suppliers in the market, including countries like
Brazil and South Korea.''
   Ferrari said the fiscal 1987 totals would not have dropped nearly
as much if Congress had not blocked Reagan administration proposals
to sell new jet aircraft to such Middle East countries as Saudi
Arabia.
   Pentagon figures show that based on deliveries of equipment in
fiscal 1987, the Middle East ``continued to be the largest
recipients of U.S. military exports in 1987,'' Ferrari said.
   Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt led the way in that region, he
added.
   The six largest U.S. arms contractors account for 55 percent of
the total FMS awards in fiscal 1987, the study said.
   Besides McDonnell Douglas, they are General Dynamics Corp., which
had $606.9 million in foreign sales; Grumman Corp., with $503.7
million; General Electric Co., $341.5 million; Raytheon Co., $326.2
million, and United Technologies Corp., $223 million.
   General Dynamics had held the top spot two years ago with sales
of $1.4 billion.
   Rounding out the top 10 arms exporters were Lockheed Corp.,
$197.1 million; General Motors Corp., $194 million; Unisys, $173.1
million, and Westinghouse Electric Corp., $122.7 million.
   The center said the export contracts for fiscal 1987 benefited
the states of New York, California, Massachusetts, Texas and
Missouri the most.
   The awards to contractors in New York totaled $706 million,
compared to $686.7 million for California; $541.6 million for
Massachusetts; $522.9 million for Texas, and $499.5 million for
Missouri.

   Firefighters refused to respond to medical
emergencies at the monastery, garbagemen wouldn't pick up its trash
and a county health worker described its tiny patients as ``little
rattlesnakes.''
   The reason: Starcross Monastic Community, a Roman Catholic
monastery run by lay workers, wanted to provide a home for infants
with AIDS.
   Yet through it all, much of the bad was offset, said Tolbert
McCarroll.
   ``For every problem we encountered, there was some surprising
force that came along to balance it,'' said McCarroll, author of
``Morning Glory Babies.''
   McCarroll, known as Brother Toby, said the book is an
``unconcealed plea'' to readers to adopt infants infected with the
AIDS virus who otherwise will ``spend their days in walkers tethered
to doorknobs in hospital corridors.''
   ``There are a lot of misconceptions about how ill these babies
are,'' he said in an interview. ``People think they are nothing but
trouble, always sick.
   ``Nothing could be further from the truth, as we hope our story
shows.''
   McCarroll describes a social worker yanking Starcross Monastic
Community's 12-year-old foster care license because it would not
abandon plans to care for the infants, a neighbor telling reporters
the nearby town of Annapolis didn't consider Starcross ``part of the
community anymore'' and a poster being defaced with graffiti
reading: ``Catch exotic diseases, kiss AIDS infected kids.''
   ``We never carried (the babies) near the public road because of
some threats shouted from cars,'' McCarroll writes in the 160-page
book, published last month by St. Martin's Press.
   Even now that two years have passed, McCarroll said, ``good will
toward us will continue to be a local sin for some time to come.''
   The monastery, about 120 miles north of San Francisco, cares for
three or four infants with AIDS.
   Although the internationally known monastery's conflicts have
been reported before, the book, which details the first two years of
Starcross's efforts to help the babies, offers the most complete
picture so far of its struggles since November 1986.
   Aside from neighbors' fears, the ``most antagonistic reaction''
came from the government, McCarroll said.
   At one point, a social worker ordered McCarroll's 82-year-old
bedridden mother, who lived in a separate house on the remote
property in Sonoma County, to be fingerprinted for a criminal check,
McCarroll says. After an argument over the matter, he said, the
monastery's license was temporarily revoked.
   Despite the problems, ``unsolicited helpers'' began showing up,
offering physical labor, supplies and friendship.
   A banker with AIDS who has two children started showing up early
in the morning to do whatever was needed; an elderly woman would
drop off a newly made quilt and baby kimonos every few months; a
public health worker brought diapers on his day off; and a retired
New York subway worker ``tackled the mysteries'' of farm chores.
   Since 1981, about 1,020 cases of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome have struck children younger than 5, according to the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. AIDS can be passed from
mother to child at or before birth.
   McCarroll and health officials warn that by the mid-1990s
thousands of infants will be infected with the virus. Up to half
will need foster homes.
   Although organized religion's response to the epidemic has been
slow, McCarroll said AIDS gradually is teaching many people what it
means to be Christian.

<HEAD>Study of Nearly 5,000 AIDS Patients Confirms Drug Prolongs Survival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 5,000 people who took the AIDS-fighting
drug once known as AZT survived at a much greater rate than those
without it, say researchers for the medicine's maker.
   The finding confirms the life-saving potential of zidovudine,
which is sold under the brand name Retrovir, said a Duke University
physician independent of the study group.
   Researchers enrolled 4,805 patients who had suffered from
pneumonia, common in people with AIDS, and treated them with
zidovudine, the only AIDS-fighting medication approved by the
federal government.
   Seventy-three percent of the subjects were still alive about 10
months after treatment started, the researchers reported in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   No direct comparison figures are available for people who didn't
take the drug, since withholding it for study purposes is unethical,
said Terri Creagh-Kirk, an epidemiologist at Burroughs-Wellcome Co.,
the North Carolina company that makes zidovudine.
   But records of people who were diagnosed with AIDS before
zidovudine became available show only 50 percent survived past 11
months, she said.
   Zidovudine, taken in capsule form, inhibits growth of the virus
that causes AIDS, Ms. Creagh-Kirk said.
   It is considered the mainstay of treatment for adults with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, but does not cure the disease.
   The study was designed by the National Cancer Institute, the Food
and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, Ms. Creagh-Kirk said.
   The study provides ``important confirmatory evidence'' supporting
the zidovudine's effectiveness in patients with AIDS and a milder
form of the disease called AIDS-related complex, Dr. John A.
Bartlett of Duke said in an editorial accompanying the study.
   ``Contrary to earlier predictions of the limited lifetime of
zidovudine, its future appears bright'' because of the scarcity of
other medications that can fight the AIDS virus, Bartlett wrote.
   Subjects had to take the drug every four hours in doses starting
at 200 milligrams. Doses were reduced for those reporting side
effects, including anemia.
   The study, started in October 1986, included about 1,000 members
of racial minorities, close to 150 women and 300 intravenous drug
users, as well as homosexual and bisexual men, Ms. Creagh-Kirk said.
   Previous studies had focused mostly on homosexual and bisexual
men, because they represent the largest proportion of AIDS
sufferers, she said.
   Subjects were recommended by their physicians, who recorded data
on their conditions during the study period and reported it to a
coordinating center in Beltsville, Md.
   Enrollment of new patients continued until March 1987, when the
drug received FDA approval.
   Of the 4,805 subjects, 2,838 were reported still alive during the
last 10 weeks of checkups, through Sept. 15, 1987, the researchers
said.
   ``It is likely that many other patients were still alive on Sept.
15, 1987, although no information concerning them has been received
since June 30, 1987,'' they wrote.
   During the study, 847 patients were reported to have died, but
Ms. Creagh-Kirk said some doctors failed to provide regular updates
on their patients, and more deaths may have occurred without the
researchers' knowledge.
   Their calculation of a 73 percent survival rate takes into
account such limitations, she said.
   Other limitations noted by Bartlett included lack of confirmation
of physicians' observations; possible bias in the way doctors
selected patients; and absence of supervision in reporting of data.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's
revolutionary patriarch, reiterated his support for Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi two months after Musavi tried to resign.
   In a lengthy statement broadcast Thursday on Tehran television,
the 87-year-old Khomeini said he had to confirm his support of
Musavi because some people might want to ``harm your relentless and
tireless efforts, especially on the issue of the war.''
   ``As before, I regard you as a qualified and sympathetic
individual for the Islamic Revolution,'' Khomeini said. He also
asked Musavi to form an organization to care for disabled war
veterens.
   Musavi thanked Khomeini for his support, calling it ``an
encouragement,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   In September, Musavi submitted his letter of resignation.
Khomeini rejected it and rebuked him for attempting to resign.
   Long-simmering differences within the leadership are believed to
have prompted Musavi's attempt.
   He is regarded as one of the more conservative leaders in the
split between the conservative and pragmatic camps. He advocated
continuing the eight-year war with Iraq, which pragmatics headed by
parliamentary speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani opposed.
   Musavi also advocates a more centralized economy and tight
controls on foreign imports, which Iran has to finance with scarce
hard currency. Rafsanjani opposes Musavi on both issues.
   The prime minister has had to defer to the will of the pragmatic
leaders on the war, and his views on the economy also are unlikely
to be implemented as Iran moves toward a more laissez-faire economy.
   Relations with the West and the Persian Gulf states, strained
during the war, are being improved, a move which Rafsanjani favored
but Musavi opposed.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed unchanged against the Japanese yen
Friday, and share prices gained ground on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
reversing Thursday's decline.
   The dollar closed at 121.15 yen, unchanged from Thursday's close
of 121.15 yen. After opening at 120.88 yen, the currency moved in a
range of 120.67 yen to 121.20 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 90.09-point
loser Thursday, gained 66.62, or 0.23 percent, to close at 29,406.65.
   The dollar opened lower after declining in London overnight.
   Exchange dealers said intervention by the Bank of Japan and
bullish comments by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa had slowed but
not stopped the dollar's decline.
   Miyazawa told reporters Friday that Japan is ready to intervene
in the currency market to stem volatility in exchange rates.
   He also said he sees no need for a meeting of the Group of Seven
(G-7) monetary nations based on fluctuations in the currency market.
His comments followed calls from finance ministers Gerhard
Stoltenberg West Germany and Pierre Beregovoy of France for a G-7
meeting after President-elect George Bush's inauguration.
   Exchange dealers said market sentiment toward the dollar remains
bearish.
   ``The best explanation about the dollar's bearishness is that the
market cannot find reasons to buy the dollar,'' said a dealer at a
major U.S. bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It was the first time since Jan. 4 that the dollar opened at the
120-yen level.
   Prices meanwhile remained firm in the stock market. Securities
dealers said most shares are rising, including export-oriented
shares, despite the strong yen.
   ``The general sentiment of the market is still bullish,'' said
Ichitaro Watanabe of Nikko Securities Co.

<HEAD>Study Says Retirement May Hinder, Not Help Couples</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retirement may not bring couples closer
together and could damage a shaky marriage, a study says.
   Retirement has no beneficial effects on the quality of marriages
among older people, said Gary Lee, a University of Florida
gerontologist and sociology professor.
   That does not mean retirement is bad, he said, but it indicates
that retirement may not add anything to a marriage and certainly
will not improve a bad one.
   ``For an event that is supposed to be a real change, (retirement)
has surprisingly few and surprisingly weak effects,'' Lee said.
``The negative effects are few, but retirement is not going to save
a failing marriage.
   ``Basically, people are the same folks they were before they
retired; they're just not working,'' he said.
   One circumstance where retirement may hurt a marriage is when the
husband retires, but the wife continues to work.
   Lee came to these conclusions after he and an associate,
Constance Shehan, studied the results of marital satisfaction
questionnaires from 2,176 Washington state households with at least
one resident older than 55.
   Respondents were asked to identify their own and their spouse's
employment status, their length of retirement and marital
satisfaction.
   One of the surprises Lee found was that even after a husband
retires, he usually does not assist in the domestic chores around
the house.
   Lee said this may be a reason women report less marital
satisfaction after their husbands retire if they are still working,
whether inside or outside of the home.
   There is also a minority of couples who have problems because the
husband retires and then wants to help out more around the house.
Lee said that can make wives annoyed and dissatisfied with their
marriages.
   Lee said while he found that retirement does not add anything to
a marriage, there are some steps that couples can take to strengthen
their relationship.
   Planning may be one thing that will help couples enjoy their
marriages more and make a smoother transition to retirement, Lee
said.
   ``One easy thing to suggest from these results is there is a
reasonable argument that couples who are both working, who retire at
the same time, may find that more beneficial,'' he said.

<HEAD>Afghan Troops Defeat Mutineers Trying To Seize Headquarters</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MOSCOW ( AP) _ Afghan government troops ambushed and defeated a
mutinous Afghan army detachment of 400 men who tried to seize a
provincial headquarters, Tass reported.
   The Soviet news agency said Thursday in a dispatch from Kabul
that the Monday night incident was a coup attempt in the city of
Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
   It said officers and soldiers loyal to the pro-Soviet Afghan
government learned of the plan, ambushed the mutineers and forced
them into retreat in a bloody battle.
   In another report from Kabul, capital of the war-torn country,
Tass said Afghan troops uncovered 70 corpses in plastic bags near
the border city of Torkham.
   ``Investigating bodies reached the conclusion that they were
tortured to death,'' it said, adding that the victims' hands and
legs were chained and traces of chemicals were found on the faces of
some of the dead.
   Fighting in the area reportedly forced suspension of the
investigation.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters at
a briefing in Moscow that a Pakistan-based rebel group used poison
pills to kill a Soviet prisoner and tested the pills on two Afghan
officers, who also died.
   ``Rebels from the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group intend to use the
tablets to kill unsuitable persons,'' Tass said.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and have been
helping the Marxist government fight U.S.-backed Moslem rebels.
Under an agreement signed in April, all 100,000 troops are to be out
by Feb. 15.

   A collision between a pickup truck and

authorities said.
   The victims included five occupants of the car and the driver of
the truck.
   Ventura County fire Battalion Chief Dale Miller said the wreckage
indicated the crash occurred early Thursday at a high speed. The
accident is under investigation.
   The collision, on what is known locally as ``blood alley''
because of frequent accidents, occurred despite the California
Highway Patrol's assignment of four extra officers to the stretch of
State Route 126 from Ventura to Fillmore, northwest of Los Angeles.
   The names of the victims were not immediately released. A
California Highway Patrol official said some family members of the
dead were in Mexico and identities would not be released until they
were notified.

   When will a llama become a mama?
   It isn't always easy for llama ranchers to tell when one of their
fat, wooly animals is pregnant, but a human hospital is cashing in
on finding out.
   ``We're the llama pregnancy factory of the world,'' said Glenn
Lee, head of outpatient laboratory services for Queen of the Valley
Hospital.
   ``UPS, Federal Express, every delivery system in the U.S. pulls
into the lab's driveway at least once a day,'' he said.
   The hospital performs up to 600 llama pregnancy tests a month for
breeders as far away as Louisiana, Texas and Canada, Lee said. The
hospital estimates that it now performs five times as many tests for
llamas as it does for humans.
   Llamas, pretty-eyed, long-necked members of the camel family, are
popular as pets and pack animals. With baby llamas selling for
$10,000 or more, people who raise the creatures like to know as soon
as possible when their animals are expecting.
   ``It can cost you a great deal of time and effort if you think a
llama is pregnant and she isn't,'' said Don Judah, head of the
hospital's radiology services and owner of five of the animals. ``If
she is, you can make some money.''
   Queen of the Valley Hospital began doing the tests in 1982, when
a local physician who raises llamas asked if the lab could run a
test on one of his animals. Word of the lab's services spread among
breeders, and what began as a favor soon became a business that
offers llama breeders the same-day testing and notification it gives
to its human patients.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said it will not
send black leader Nelson Mandela back to prison when he completes
his hospital stay but will keep him under guard at an unspecified
location.
   A brief statement on Thursday by Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee
did not give any details on when Mandela would leave the hospital,
where he would be taken, or what restrictions he would face.
   The 70-year-old Mandela, head of the African National Congress
guerrilla movement, has been recovering from tuberculosis since
August at the Constantiaberg Clinic in Cape Town.
   Dirk de Villiers, a spokesman for Coetsee, said today that
Mandela is still at the clinic.
   Mandela's health has ``improved to such an extent that should the
improvement continue it will eventually no longer be necessary to
care for him in a clinic,'' Coetsee said.
   ``When the time arrives he will be transferred to suitable,
comfortable and secure living accommodations, where he will be able
to receive members of his family more freely and on a continual
basis,'' Coetsee said.
   ``His family will be informed of the locality in due course,''
the statement concluded.
   The Citizen, a pro-government English-language newspaper,
reported today that Coetsee's reference to ``secure living
accomodations'' may mean that Mandela would be accomodated in a
house built for prison officials on a prison farm.
   ``These homes are within the enclosed prison compound and
therefore Mandela's security would not pose an insurmountable
problem,'' The Citizen said.
   It also referred to speculation that Mandela might be allowed to
receive visitors outside his immediate family and lawyer, including
the press, and that it may become possible to quote him. It is now
illegal to quote him or print his picture.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, said in a statement issued by family
attorney Ismail Ayob that she ``attaches no significance to the
(government) statement.''
   ``Mr. Mandela still remains a prisoner of the South African
government and there is no indication of any imminent release,'' the
statement said.
   The government statement suggests authorities are attempting to
release Mandela in stages in an effort to temper the public's
reaction to the country's best known black leader.
   The government has expressed concern that Mandela's release could
reignite black political demonstrations that have largely been
quieted under the 29-month-old state of emergency.
   Earlier Thursday, Pat Robertson, a television preacher and former
U.S. presidential candidate, told reporters he had discussed Mandela
during an hour-long meeting with President P.W. Botha at government
headquarters in Pretoria.
   Robertson said the president told him that Mandela will not be
returned to prison, but would be placed in custody to protect him
from assassination.
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life prison
sentence for conspiring with other leaders of the African National
Congress to wage an anti-government sabotage campaign.
   A prolonged international campaign has sought his release.
   Mandela was transferred from Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison to the
state-run Tygerberg Hospital in early August for treatment of
tuberculosis. He was moved Aug. 31 to the Constantiaberg Clinic, a
private hospital in a Cape Town suburb.
   Since 1985, Botha has offered to release Mandela if he would
renounce violence. Mandela has refused, saying he will do so only if
the African National Congress is unbanned and apartheid is
dismantled.
   Botha recently has hinted that Mandela could be released without
renouncing violence, but there has been no definitive government
statement on the matter.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias, backed by
Syria and Iran, battled with tanks, rockets and mortars in the slums
of south Beirut today.
   Police said seven people were killed and 20 wounded before a
cease-fire ended the worst fighting in six months.
   A police spokesman said most casualties were residents caught in
crossfire after skirmishes broke out Thursday night between the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the pro-Syrian Amal.
Amal is Arabic for ``hope.''
   Both sides accused each other of provoking the clash, the
fiercest since Syrian troops were deployed in south Beirut in May to
end two weeks of Amal-Hezbollah fighting.
   The spokesman said stray shells hit several apartments in the
densely populated slum area, driving panic-stricken residents to
spend the night in basements and bomb shelters.
   The exchanges died down at 3:30 a.m. after a cease-fire was
called by a Syrian army contingent in charge of security in west and
south Beirut, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Exploding shells and bursts of machine-gun fire echoed around the
city during the night as the two factions fired mortar rounds and
rocket-propelled grenades.
   ``I was preparing dinner when the clashes broke out,'' said Umm
Mohammed, a housewife in south Beirut's Haret Hreik district. ``My
daughter, three grandchildren and I rushed to the basement for
cover. We didn't have dinner.'' She said that during a lull in the
fighting, ``when I tried to fetch some food from the apartment I saw
Amal tanks rumbling across the narrow alley and the Hezbollahis
started shooting at them.''
   She said she ventured out this morning to buy food. ``I don't
trust the cease-fire, they will fight again,'' she said.
   Shortly after midnight, fighting spread to the west Beirut
districts of Basta, Nouwairi and Zokat Blatt when a rocket-propelled
grenade slammed into the apartment of Ayoub Homayed, a ranking Amal
leader.
   The police spokesman said Homayed and his family were unhurt.
   Amal and Hezbollah are longtime rivals for dominance of the 1
million Shiites, the largest single sect in Lebanon.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah blamed Amal for a failed car-bomb
assassination attempt against four senior Hezbollah leaders Monday
in east Lebanon.
   Amal had accused Hezbollah of assassinating the militia's three
top commanders for south Lebanon in a Sept. 22 ambush in south
Beirut.
   The police spokesman said Amal fighters, backed by six
Soviet-made T-54 tanks, advanced about 500 yards across the northern
flank of Hezbollah-controlled territory in south Beirut's Mouawad
district.
   He said the two sides were observing a ``cease-fire-in-place,''
with Amal militiamen refusing to withdraw from the area they gained.
   ``The gunmen are still there. God knows when they will start
shooting again,'' the spokesman said.
   Schools, banks, shops, restaurants and other businesses stayed
closed for the day in south Beirut, and traffic was sparse on the
usually crowded streets.
   Schools in west Beirut also stayed closed and only a few
employees turned up for work at banks, restaurants and government
offices.
   ``We do not want to be responsible for the students if
large-scale hostilities break out,'' said Khalaf Wihbeh, a
schoolteacher in west Beirut.

   When the high school students in this small
town in the Ozarks hold their first-ever school dance outsiders
won't be welcome and neither will reporters.
   A ban on school dances at Purdy High School was struck down by a
judge last summer and the first dance is scheduled for Dec. 10,
although administrators are still fighting it.
   ``I'm looking forward to it. I'm excited,'' said Nancy Fox, who
is in charge of choosing a dance theme, music and colors for the
paper streamers.
   A group of 21 Purdy students, including Miss Fox, and their
parents filed a lawsuit challenging the dance ban in 1986 with the
help of the American Civil Liberties Union. In the past, students
had only small dances at the community center in this small
southwest Missouri town.
   The case drew nationwide attention, in part because of its
similarities to the plot of the movie ``Footloose,'' about a
fictional town where dancing was banned.
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ruled in August that the ban in
the rural town of 900 unconstitutionally promoted the values of
residents who opposed dancing for religious reasons.
   The school board has appealed, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in St. Louis has allowed plans for a dance to proceed
pending its review. The court has scheduled arguments in the case at
the end of the year.
   School Superintendent Sheldon Buxton and Principal Ron Richardson
devised dance guidelines admittedly more restrictive than those at
other schools.
   ``I don't know of any other schools that are having a dance that
is this important,'' Buxton said. ``This is not an ordinary dance.''
   Buxton and Miss Fox said the most controversial of the rules is
one barring from the dance all but the 160 Purdy High School
students.
   Miss Fox said classmates who date students from other schools
would like to invite them. But Buxton said he feared outsiders bent
on disruption would be attracted by the dance's notoriety.
   ``I think it'll still be fun,'' Miss Fox said. ``I think that a
majority of the students will show. It will be a fun activity _ I
like to dance.''
   Another guideline _ barring reporters from the gymnasium where
the dance is scheduled _ was inspired by the students. ``They want a
homecoming dance, not a forum for the media,'' Buxton said.
   The administration also vetoed the student council's decision to
accept a Springfield radio station's offer of a disc jockey and
music for free.
   Buxton said the station had made ``derogatory comments about the
board. (I am) trying to neutralize what I consider to be an
emotional thing.'' The Purdy dance case had been the subject of
humorous skits and comment on the station.
   Miss Fox said other disc jockeys and stations also have offered
free music, and student leaders are making a second choice. ``I
don't really think it'll matter too much who it is, as long as
there's music,'' Miss Fox said.

   Gunmen apparently targeting a
Sinn Fein councilman shot and killed his brother instead, police
said.
   Phelim McNally, 28, was slain Thursday night while he was playing
an accordion in the kitchen of the home of his brother, local Sein
Fein councilman Francis McNally, police said. Sinn Fein is the legal
political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which
the British domestic news agency Press Association said occurred
near Coagh, 30 miles west of Belfast.
   An officer at Belfast police headquarters confirmed a man was
killed but refused to elaborate. A press officer in Belfast later
said the gunmen may have been seeking to kill the councilman, not
his brother.
   The press officer said the gunmen, believed to number three,
fired through the kitchen window from outside the house. The
brothers were the only ones at home at the time, police and news
reports said.
   The news agency said the victim had been to the hospital to visit
his wife, who is expecting their sixth child, and then visited his
brother's house. The news agency also said it appeared he may have
been mistaken for his brother.
   Earlier Thursday night, a British soldier suffered leg injuries
in a bomb attack on an army patrol in the Roman Catholic area of
west Belfast.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bomb attack,
but suspicion fell on the IRA, which is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland. The mainly Catholic IRA wants to unite the
predominantly Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic
Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   On Wednesday night, an IRA bomb attack on an unmanned part-time
police station at Benburb, 35 miles west of Belfast, killed a
67-year-old Catholic and his 13-year-old granddaughter. Eight
civilians were wounded.
   The IRA, claiming responsibility, called the deaths of Barney
Lavery and Emma Donnelly ``tragic.'' Their deaths bring the total of
innocent civilians killed in bungled IRA attacks the last 12 months
to at least 19.
   In London on Thursday, the British government proposed
legislation that among other things requires Northern Ireland
election candidates to sign a declaration disavowing terrorism.
   Northern Ireland has been plagued by political and sectarian
violence since August 1969 and more than 2,700 people have been
killed. The IRA is outlawed in both Britain and Ireland.
   The anti-violence oath applies to all candidates in the province
but is believed aimed mainly at Sinn Fein. The law is likely to take
effect before the municipal elections in May.
   Sinn Fein commands about one-third of the Roman Catholic vote in
the troubled province and won about 10 percent of the seats on 17 of
the province's 26 local authorities in May 1985 elections.
   Under its terms, elected candidates must sign the declaration
before they can take their seats. If they then voice support for
violence, they can be disqualified from office for five years if
successfully prosecuted by fellow council members or members of the
public.
   In other proposed measures, a law on prison sentences would
require a prisoner to serve two-thirds of his time instead of being
eligible for parole at midpoint in his term, as under current law.
The Northern Ireland Office says one-fifth of offenders released in
1984 committed offenses within two years.
   Another measure limits banking secrecy and empower courts to
seize funds believed to be earned from racketeering related to
terrorism.
   Last month, Britain banned broadcast interviews with members of
the IRA and 10 other militant Northern Ireland groups, Catholic and
Protestant. The government also plans to end the right of suspects
to remain silent under police interrogation.
   The laws are virtually certain to pass in the House of Commons,
where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has a huge majority.

   Radical students and Buddhist monks
demanding the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan hurled
hundreds of firebombs today at riot police in street clashes after
authorities blocked a protest march.
   Radicals battled police in streets and alleyways around Dongguk
University in eastern Seoul about some 2,000 students from 10 Seoul
colleges tried to march out despite freezing temperatures. About
1,000 protesters stormed out of the college to bombard troopers with
rocks and firebombs that exploded in showers of blazing gasoline.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan,'' protesters shouted. ``Yankee go home''
   Several thousand riot police in green combat fatigues and black
visored helmets ringed the campus to stop students breaking through.
Troopers fired volleys of choking tear gas and hurled back rocks and
other missiles.
   Police had no immediate word on casualties or arrests.
   Student leaders at an earlier campus rally denounced Chun's
apology on Wednesday for corruption and human rights abuses. Leaders
demanded the former president be arrested and prosecuted for
numerous alleged crimes.
   Protesters also denounced President Roh Tae-woo and demanded he
also be punished. Speakers told the cheering crowd that Roh was
guilty of corruption and was trying to protect Chun.
   Protesters burned an effigy of Roh before marching out with
banners and flags to try and parade through the city. ``Punish Roh
Tae-woo,'' protesters chanted.
   Buddhisht monks armed with firebombs joined the students in the
fighting. Chun has taken refuge in a remote Buddhist monastery on
the east coast, and the monks claimed his presence there was a
desecration of a holy place.
   ``Drive out Chun from our sacred temple,'' the monks chanted.
   Chun, in a nationally televised speech Wednesday, apologized for
abuses under his seven-year authoritarian rule. Chun said he was
surrendering his personal property and going into internal exile.
   Chun has denied any personal corrutpion, but some of his
relatives and associates have been convicted of or charged with
embezzlement and other offenses.
   Dissident groups refused to accept the apology as sufficent and
said Chun must be prosecuted. The main opposition parties have also
said further explanation is necessary.
   Roh, a former close associate of Chun, is scheduled to make a
statement Saturday in which he may pardon the former president or at
least ask for public mercy. The announcement probably would trigger
further outbursts from radicals and other opposition groups.
   Earlier, the presidential office said Roh would appear on
national television tonight to make the statement, but it changed
the day.
   ``Enough has been done,'' Roh told governing party officials on
Thursday. ``As a long friend, I felt deep sorrow for the former
president, who had to leave in such a way.''
   Roh is trying to defuse public anger against Chun without
damaging himself and his government. Many Koreans see the Roh
administration as a continuation of the Chun government.
   Roh, a former general who took power in February after winning
elections in December, has introduced broad, democratic reforms. He
has dismantled many of the authoritarian controls imposed by Chun,
who took power with military backing in 1980.
   North Korea today called Chun's apology ``an offspring of
conspiracy and compromise'' between Chun and the South Korean
government.
   The official (North) Korean Central News Agency quoted a
spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the
Fatherland as saying Chun ``tried to gloss over his shocking
murderous atrocities, including the Kwangju bloodbath and all kinds
of irregularities, with the monosyllable word, `I apologize.'''
   A 1980 civil uprising in the southern city of Kwangju was
violently quashed by the military, resulting in the deaths of about
200 people.
   ``It is preposterous, indeed, to try to dispose of Chun's crimes
with something like an `apology,''' the unidentified spokesman was
quoted as saying.
   The two Koreas have remained bitter rivals since the Korean
peninsula was divided into the communist north and pro-Western south
at the end of World War II. Both sides fought the bloody Korean war
in 1950-53.

<HEAD>Robbery Suspect Calls FBI Collect To Chat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested a bank robbery suspect
who dialed the Baltimore FBI office collect from San Diego and
chatted 45 minutes as agents traced his name through a computer.
   The agents learned he was the last of three suspects wanted in a
bank robbery last week in nearby Catonsville. They confirmed his
identity and the location of the public phone where he was talking
and alerted agents at the San Diego office to pick him up.
   The rambling conversation ended Tuesday night with his arrest.
   ``He identified himself,'' said Jim Dearborn, an FBI spokesman in
Baltimore. ``He wanted to talk to some people in law enforcement
about his situation ... concerning any charges that might have been
outstanding.''
   During the conversation, the man said he was calling from a
telephone booth at a Western Union office in San Diego, just a
couple of blocks from the FBI office there.
   Through the National Crime Information Center, agents learned
that Ryan Patrick Saunders, 23, had been charged in a Baltimore
County warrant with the Nov. 17 robbery of a Baltimore Federal
Financial savings and loan office in Catonsville, Dearborn said.
   Saunders was being held by the San Diego Police Department
pending extradition, according to Baltimore County police spokesman
E. Jay Miller.

<HEAD>Huge US Heroin Shipment Expected From Bumper Poppy Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expected bumper crop of poppies in the Golden
Triangle of Southeast Asia probably will lead to a huge shipment of
heroin into the United States, a top U.S. drug enforcement official
said today.
   Thomas C. Kelly, deputy administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Agency, also said shipment of heroin from the Golden Triangle
through China has become a serious problem that Beijing authorities
are working to control.
   Much of the heroin smuggled into the United States, where about
500,000 people are believed addicted to the drug, comes from the
remote territory where Burma, Laos and Thailand meet.
   ``The past couple of years we've had bumper crops coming out of
the Golden Triangle,'' Kelly told reporters in Hong Kong. ``This
year ... appears to be no exception to the bumper crop of the poppy
and we are projecting there is going to be a tremendous shipment of
heroin into the U.S.,'' he said.
   Chinese officials are still learning how to fight the smuggling
and have talked to U.S. drug enforcement agents about the
possibility of additional training, he said.
   Kelly, who is visiting Hong Kong after attending an Interpol
meeting in Thailand, said the role of this British colony in
international heroin trafficking has increased because it is a major
transportation hub near the Golden Triangle.
   The amount of heroin coming through Hong Kong is likely to rise
with the continued good harvests, he added.
   Kelly said there were no reliable estimates of the amount of
heroin shipped from Hong Kong to the United States or what
percentage of the drug reaching America is shipped through this
British colony.
   But he said ethnic Chinese have captured much of the U.S. market
because of their business acumen, their contacts in Asia and
crackdowns on the traditional Mafia.
   U.S. and Hong Kong drug enforcement agencies have cooperated in a
number of major heroin busts in the past year.
   Hong Kong police announced Thursday they have seized 596 pounds
of No. 4 grade heroin so far this year, more than double the 1987
total of 286 pounds. No. 4 heroin is the grade used in the United
States.

   Charles Vest said he had just about given up
hope on finding a way to bring his sister home from Alaska so she
could be with their dying father. Then, from a hospital pay phone,
he called the White House.
   Vest's 71-year-old father, Lester, a farmer from Trimble County,
was dying of lung and bone cancer and the family couldn't scrape
together enough money for the elder daughter, Teresa Vest, to fly in
from Anchorage, Alaska.
   It had been 14 years since Teresa had seen her family.
   ``By the time I called the White House, I was to the point that I
didn't think there was a person in the world that cared _ that
unless you were a really big shot, it didn't matter,'' Vest said.
   ``I called her (Teresa) the night that I took Daddy to the
hospital, and it was hard on her,'' said the 28-year-old Vest, who
quit his job at a small plant in Madison, Ind., a month ago to care
for his father and 65-year-old mother, who is recuperating from
open-heart surgery.
   The next day, Vest began calling charitable organizations and
churches for help to bring his sister home to this northern Kentucky
town, but without success.
   Finally, through Gov. Wallace Wilkinson's office, Vest was put in
touch with a social-services worker who persuaded an airline to
reduce its Alaska-to-Kentucky round-trip fare by about half. But
that was still too expensive.
   It was late in the day, and Vest and another sister, Velvet, sat
quietly discussing what to do next.
   ``I said, `Well, it probably won't do a bit of good, but I'm
going to call the White House. Maybe the president could do
something, if he would,' '' Vest said.
   A long distance operator helped Vest reach the White House, where
his call was finally transferred to Charlene Cozart, one of several
special liasons to the president.
   ``She called me back the next morning and said, `The ticket's at
the airport. All you have to do is pick it up.' ''
   Ms. Cozart said the White House gets several thousand similar
requests each year, and they are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
   Teresa Vest arrived from Alaska on Nov. 4, one week before her
father died.
   ``When I told him she was on her way, he said, `I'll have to see
her walk through that door before I believe it,' '' Vest remembers
his father saying. ``It was a real happy moment, right in the middle
of a really sad moment.''

   A Guatemalan gunboat fired a shot after a British
naval vessel refused its order to halt off the Central American
country of Belize, the Foreign Office said today.
   A spokesman said the government will bring up Sunday's incident
with the Guatemalan authorities, but he could not say whether a
protest would be filed.
   ``We'll have it taken up with them. What form that will take,
frankly I don't know,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. ``We'll have to talk with them first.''
   He said the HMS Fawn, an 800-ton inshore survey vessel, was in
the territorial waters of Belize when the Guatemalan gunboat ordered
it to stop.
   When the Fawn ignored the order, the gunboat fired a shot. Two
Royal Air Force Harrier jet fighters flew to the area, and the
Guatemalans agreed to withdraw their ship after telephone contact
with British authorities, said the official.
   Belize, a former British colony, gained independence in 1981 but
requested British troops to remain until a territorial dispute with
neighboring Guatemala is resolved. About 2,000 British troops are
stationed in Belize.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister To Visit Iran Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time since the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini took power in Iran, a French foreign minister will meet
with officials in Tehran next year, the government announced today.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas will travel to Tehran at an
unspecified date in 1989, a foreign ministry spokesman said,
confirming a report carried Thursday by the official Iranian news
agency IRNA.
   In November, Dumas told reporters, ``This voyage (to Iran) will
take place. I cannot say when, but I am completely ready to
undertake it.''
   The foreign minister has a trip to Iraq planned for mid-December,
although an exact date has not yet been announced. France has been a
major supplier of arms to Iraq throughout the Iran-Iraq war.
   The visit to Iran, the first since the 1979 overthrow of Shah
Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, comes at the end of a turbulant period in
French-Iranian relations.
   In June 1987, French investigators sought to question Iranian
Embassy translator Wahid Gordji about possible links to people
accused in the September 1986 bombings in Paris that left 11 people
dead and more than 150 people injured.
   Gordji took refuge in the embassy, whose officials asserted he
had diplomatic immunity. The French disagreed and blockaded the
embassy. The standoff continued and relations further deteriorated
until a final diplomatic rupture on July 17.
   At the end of November, two French hostages were released in
Beirut and shortly afterward Gordji was questioned and put on a
plane for home.
   Diplomatic relations were restored June 16.
   In November, a French parliamentary delegation visited Tehran to
meet with Iranian deputies from the foreign ministry and the prime
minister's office.
   A group of French businessmen accompanied the politicians,
including representatives from drug firms and construction companies.
   Since the cease-fire was declared in the war, West Germany, Italy
and Britain also have sent sizeable delegations to negotiate for the
millions of dollars worth of work that will be needed to reconstruct
the country following the eight-year war.
   A second French delegation of businessmen is expected to make a
trip to Iran this month.
   Iran's deputy foreign minister for European and U.S. Affairs
Mohammad Larijani has visited Paris twice since early August in
connection with ongoing peace negotiations in Geneva to end the
Persian Gulf war.

   The army sentenced 21 paratroopers to up to two
weeks in prison after a rampage in which soldiers smashed windows of
homes and damaged cars in a Palestinian refugee camp, a military
spokesman said today.
   Right-wing politicians demanded the soldiers be immediately
pardoned, and one leading left-wing leader blamed government
policies for the rampage, instead of the soldiers.
   An Israeli officer, meanwhile, testified at the trial of four
soldiers in the beating death of a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip
that the soldiers were obeying orders, the Hebrew-language daily
Hadashot reported.
   ``The order to beat Arab rioters came straight from the commander
of the Gaza Strip, Brig. Gen. Zvi Poleg, and the soldiers were
carrying out the spirit of the order,'' the paper quoted Lt. Rafil
Tawil as saying.
   Another soldier, Haim Teferberg, was quoted in the newspaper
Haaretz as testifying he saw the victim, Hani El Shemi, beaten in
the Jebaliya refugee camp. El Shemi, 43, died Aug. 22.
   Teferberg said, ``He was hunched over as he walked and blood was
dropping from his mouth. I saw him up close. They put him into the
camp, his breathing was heavy. He kept saying, `I want to die.'''
   ``When they put him on the floor I saw a soldier in the Jebaliya
refugee camp run quickly toward him and kick him, as though in a
karate move,'' the paper quoted him as saying. ``After that he no
longer had a pulse.
   ``This is customary. Many soldiers beat up prisoners,'' Teferberg
was quoted as testifying.
   During the early days of the Palestinian uprising, which began
Dec. 8, the army had a policy of clubbing protesters instead of
shooting to stop violent demonstrations. But army officials have
repeatedly denied that the policy allowed soldiers to beat prisoners
in custody.
   At least 315 Palestinians have been killed, most by army gunfire,
since the uprising started. Eleven Israelis also have died.
   Today in the Gaza Strip, a 16-year-old boy was shot and seriously
wounded in the Buriej refugee camp, hospital officials said. They
quoted camp refugees as saying the boy was hit when soldiers opened
fire on stone-throwing youths.
   In the West Bank, Jewish settlers set tires ablaze to block the
road into the Arab town of Qalqilya after a 52-year-old woman
settler was injured when someone hit her from a stone, the radio
said. Radio reports said the woman victim was hit in the eye and was
to undergo surgery today.
   The 21 soldiers sentenced to jail after the rampage Sunday in the
Kalandia refugee camp confessed to smashing windows and doors of
houses and damaging cars, Israel radio said.
   They were sentenced to a week to two weeks in jail, an army
spokesman said. He said three sergeants were given two-week
sentences with a further two weeks suspended. Their squadron leader
was sentenced Tuesday to two weeks in prison.
   Reports at the time said the soldiers went on a rampage after
their bus was stoned as it went through the camp. Witnesses said at
least four cars and 20 houses were damaged.

<HEAD>Province Bans Mentally Retarded From Having Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One province has barred mentally retarded people
from having children, and the Ministry of Public Health said today
it is drafting a law that would extend the ban nationwide.
   The People's Congress of Gansu province in northwestern China
this week passed a law ordering all mentally retarded people who
marry to be sterilized and mentally retarded women who become
pregnant to have abortions, the official People's Daily said.
   The State Family Planning Commission said it was the first law of
its kind in China. It requires sterilization for mentally retarded
people who are already married or planning to marry.
   ``Anyone responsible for allowing mentally retarded people to
give birth will be fined and subject to adminstrative discipline,''
the People's Daily said. ``The mentally retarded lack productive
capability and live on relief funds and grain. They are a great
burden to society.''
   A woman in the Ministry of Public Health's Department for Women
and Children, who refused to give her name, said the proposed
national law would affect people who are mentally retarded due to
hereditary factors, and not those impaired by accidents.
   She said draft work has been in progress for several years. No
date has been set for submission to the National People's Congress,
which must approve all national legislation.
   China has no figures on the percentage of retarded people
nationwide, but a recent survey of children under 14 indicated 1.07
percent were retarded.
   The People's Daily said more than 270,000 people, or about 1.3
percent of Gansu's population, are mentally retarded.
   A report on Gansu radio in July, when the sterilization law first
was proposed, said there was heated argument over the legislation.
Some congress delegates suggested the government first experiment
with such restrictions on a limited basis.
   The People's Daily, which did not mention any controversy, said
the law will ``raise the quality of the population'' in Gansu and
help the arid mountain region shed its traditional poverty.

   Several thousand mourners today
attended funeral services for shipping heiress Christina Onassis at
a cathedral her father helped build in this Athens suburb.
   About 500 friends and relatives packed the St. Fotini cathedral
to hear 15 priests perform the 45-minute Greek Orthodox funeral
liturgy.
   Ms. Onassis' silver-bordered, brown mahogany coffin lay under the
cathedral's dome as the bearded, golden-robed priests chanted the
Byzantine sermon accompanied by an all-male choir.
   Thierry Roussel, Ms. Onassis' fourth ex-husband, stood alone
behind the flower-covered coffin, which was flanked by Ms. Onassis'
relatives and friends.
   Greek government ministers, politicians, shipowners and
businessmen stood under the cathedral's frescoed ceilings as the
priests chanted the service.
   Roussel, who divorced Ms. Onassis in 1987 after two years of
marriage, would not answer reporters' questions.
   Ms. Onassis, 37, died Saturday of a pulmonary edema, or
accumulation of fluid in the lungs, in the Buenos Aires, Argentina,
home of long-time friends. However, the cause of death is still
under investigation. She was the heir to the fortune of her father,
shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis.
   Outside the cathedral, more than 3,000 people stood in the rain
and lined nearby apartment building balconies. They clapped and
threw rose petals in accordance with Greek tradition as young
pallbearers from the Alexander Onassis Public Benefit Foundation
carried the casket outside the church.
   ``Life to you'' they yelled as Roussel and Onassis relatives
filed out of the cathedral.
   The pallbearers all had received scholarships from the foundation
for postgraduate studies outside Greece.
   The foundation was set up by Aristotle Onassis and named after
his only son, who was killed in a 1973 plane crash. It also gives
annual awards for outstanding work in scholarship, human rights and
the environment.
   A spokesman for the foundation said Ms. Onassis' body would be
flown to the family island of Skorpios, on Greece's northwest coast,
later in the day for burial at a private ceremony Saturday.
   The spokesman, Ioannis Georgakis, said Ms. Onassis would be
buried next to her father and brother in a mausoleum on the small
island.
   Aristotle Onassis, a shipping tycoon who also had mining and real
estate interests worldwide, died in Paris in 1975. Ms. Onassis'
mother, Athena, died at the age of 45 in 1974.
   Upon the death of Aristotle Onassis, Ms. Onassis inherited half
of an estimated $1 billion fortune. The other half was given to the
foundation.
   Ms. Onassis' 3-year-old daughter Athena was not present at the
funeral services. Sources close to the Onassis family did not know
if Athena, who is Roussel's daughter, would be present at the
Skorpios burial service.
   Representatives of Springfield shipping, the company that manages
the Onassis' 2.5 million-ton shipping fleet, say Athena will inherit
her mother's fortune when she turns 18. Until then, the fortune will
be held in trust.

<HEAD>Lisa `Was The World To Me,' Steinberg Writes From Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joel Steinberg, accused of killing his illegally
adopted daughter, says the 6-year-old girl ``was the world'' to him
and that her loss is ``more than I can bear,'' New York Newsday
reported today.
   In a one-page letter written in response to questions submitted
by the newspaper, Steinberg also talked about his love for his
longtime companion, Hedda Nussbaum, who is expected to testify
against him in his murder trial when it resumes next week.
   Steinberg, jailed since his arrest in the death of Lisa Steinberg
more than a year ago, wrote by hand, ``My feelings for Lisa are
almost inexpressible.
   ``She was the world to me,'' he wrote. ``Just once, look at her
smile in one of those photographs and you will understand my
feelings. My sadness and sense of loss are more than I can bear at
times.''
   Steinberg declined to answer any questions about the events
leading up to the child's death on Nov. 5, 1987. He wrote the letter
over the objections of his defense lawyers, Newsday said.
   Steinberg indicated that he believes Nussbaum, whom the
prosecution says he allegedly abused physically and mentally during
their 12 years together, has changed.
   ``Regarding Hedda, I must tell you that I loved her very much.
All that has occurred since, has not changed the feeling I held for
her,'' Steinberg wrote.
   ``I can only hope that she is capable of the truth in relating
the events of Lisa's life and the events of Lisa's last night with
us.
   ``Given what I have read, I fear Hedda may no longer be the
person I knew and loved.''
   Steinberg, 47, is charged with second-degree murder and
first-degree manslaughter, stemming from Lisa's fatal head injury.
Although Lisa and another child, now known as Travis Christian
Smigiel, lived with Steinberg and Nussbaum in their Greenwich
Village apartment, they were never legally adopted.
   Nussbaum, 46, has told psychiatrists that Steinberg beat Lisa
into unconsciousness on the afternoon of Nov. 1, 1987, and then went
out to dinner with a friend, sources close to the case have said.
   The sources said Nussbaum told psychiatrists that she heard
sounds ``like Joel throwing Lisa'' in the apartment bedroom, but did
not see the alleged beating.
   Medical aid was not summoned until the following morning, after
Lisa stopped breathing.
   Steinberg told police and paramedics that Lisa had choked on her
vomit after eating vegetables. His attorneys have suggested that
Lisa may have suffered her injuries in an accidental fall or at the
hands of Nussbaum.
   Nussbaum, who has been hospitalized since her arrest on Nov. 2,
1987, is receiving psychiatric treatment at the Four Winds Hospital
in Westchester County. Prosecutors last month dropped all criminal
charges against her.

   Priscilla Presley says she wanted her 20-year-old
daughter Lisa Marie to wait a while before getting married.
   ``I mean, there's no rush,'' Mrs. Presley, the ex-wife of the
late singer Elvis Presley, said in the Dec. 12 issue of US magazine.
   She said she told Lisa Marie, who married musician Daniel Keough,
24, in October, ``It would be great to wait. Why don't you wait a
while?''
   Mrs. Presley, 43, met Elvis when she was 14 but didn't marry him
until she was 21. They divorced in 1973, and he died in 1977.
   Lisa Marie, heir to her father's $50 million estate, is expecting
a child in the spring.
   Mrs. Presley portrayed Jenna Wade for five years on the
television show ``Dallas,'' leaving last season to take a part in a
comedy film, ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!''

<TEXT>
   At least seven people were arrested
today in the massacre of 17 people in a mountain village chapel that
was sprayed with gunfire by unidentified men early this week, the
military said.
   The Philippine Constabulary command on the central Philippine
island of Cebu said soldiers arrested the seven in the vicinity of
Bagtik, the scene of Tuesday night's slaughter. Twelve people were
wounded in the attack.
   Cebu Gov. Emilio Osmena, constabulary provincial commander Col.
Rodolfo Garcia, and other officials flew by helicopter to Bagtik,
340 miles southeast of Manila, to investigate.
   The seven suspects were jailed in Asturias, the town closest to
the massacre scene, said Sgt. Noli Rama, a non-commissioned officer
on duty at the command's headquarters in the provincial capital of
Cebu City.
   Rama, speaking in a telephone interview, said a radio report by
military officers identified two of the suspects. One was Pelagio
Caro, who military officials claimed earlier led a band of the
communist New People's Army.
   Rama said the message gave no other details and officials in the
area were not immediately available for comment.
   Officials and survivors said dozens of villagers were praying the
Rosary inside a private chapel owned by a wealthy businesswoman and
landowner Tuesday night when an undetermined number of men opened
fire.
   Roland Mangubat, provincial board member, quoted landowner
Cresencia Hermosilia as saying she did not believe the attackers
were communist rebels but ``jealous neighbors'' who accused her of
using religion to make money.
   Mercedita Bitoon, Mrs. Hermosilia's daughter, said Thursday that
a member of a vigilante group fighting the 19-year-old communist
insurgency accused villagers of being communist sympathizers and
threatened to kill them.

<HEAD>Amendments To Tito-Era Constitution Adopted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's Parliament today adopted
amendments to the federal constitution designed to pave the way for
radical economic changes and streamline the country's communist
political system.
   The 34 amendments changed 135 articles, or about one-third of the
current Yugoslav Constitution, passed in 1974 during the rule of the
country's communist founder Josip Broz Tito.
   The 1974 constitution, believed to be the longest and most
complicated in the world, granted wide autonomy to the country's six
republics and two semi-autonomous provinces.
   It is generally blamed for the country's current political and
economic crisis, because it created eight virtually self-ruling
states that must reach consensus when passing any important new laws.
   As a result, key decisions often are watered down to muddled
compromises that keep the federal government weak and do nothing to
control spiraling inflation and foreign debt.
   The amendments adopted today were proposed by Yugoslavia's
presidency and accepted unanimously by the republics and provinces
after 21 months of strained negotiations.
   They reveal an emerging consensus that Yugoslavia should gear its
economy to an open market to overcome a $21 billion foreign debt,
inflation hovering at over 240 percent and a 15 percent unemployment
rate.
   One of the amendments opens up a possibility of full foreign
ownership of Yugoslav companies and banks operating in the country's
several free-trade zones.
   Previous constitutional provisions allowed only a 49-percent
ownership share by foreign capital, which in practice meant
foreigners could not run joint venture firms or transfer profits out
of the country.
   Foreigners will now be allowed to manage, control and even lay
off workers from joint venture companies in which they have a
majority share.
   The amendments also increase maximum private ownership of land
from 25 to 74 acres and abolish several limits on private business
and real estate ownership.
   The constitutional changes are scheduled to be codified into
economic laws by the end of this year so the country can introduce
market-oriented economy at the start of 1989.
   A draft of the new economic system approved by Parliament
envisages closing down all loss-making enterprises, introducing
private domestic and foreign capital investments and the floating of
stocks and bonds.
   In line with other communist countries, Yugoslavia previously has
shunned an open, market-oriented economy, and several attempted
reforms have foundered due to bureaucratic resistance.
   The reform drive comes as the country faces unprecedented ethnic
and labor unrest with workers protesting low salaries and living
standards which have dropped to the level of mid-1960s, according to
official statistics.
   The constitutional amendments, however, propose no fundamental
changes in Yugoslavia's communist political system.
   The amendments envisage more direct elections among several
communist candidates for political posts, but no other radical
changes.

   The venerable Pioneer 6 solar orbiter Saturday
will make its closest pass of Earth since its launch 23 years ago,
continuing on a voyage that has exceeded all expectations,
scientists say.
   The 35-inch tall craft will change course and come to within 1.16
million miles of Earth, about five times the distance of the moon,
because of the Earth's gravitational pull.
   The tug from Earth will add 6 million miles to the satellite's
orbit around the sun.
   Pioneer 6, built in Redondo Beach by TRW Space & Technology
Group, has gone long past its life expectancy, sending back enough
information about the sun to force scientists to change many of
their earlier conclusions.
   For instance, the satellite showed that solar wind does not flow
steadily and gently as once thought, but boils off the sun's surface
with such fury that it influences events in the outer reaches of the
solar system.
   Solar wind, consisting mainly of subatomic particule traveling
about 1 million mph, is what causes comets to have tails that can be
seen from Earth.

<TEXT>
   Eight victims in a 1987 shooting spree
have agreed to seek no more than $100,000 each from Allstate
Insurance Co., which issued a homeowner policy to the accused gunman.
   The cases had been scheduled to go to trial Monday in front of
Circuit Judge John Antoon. However, Allstate contends in a pending
federal suit that the policy doesn't cover William Cruse's actions
on April 23, 1987.
   Cruse, 61, a retired librarian, still faces a criminal trial in
March on six counts of murder, 28 charges of attempted murder and
two charges of kidnapping. More than 100 witnesses are preparing to
identify Cruse as the gunman who strode resolutely through two
supermarket parking lots, shooting an automatic rifle
indiscriminately.
   The central question in the civil case is much the same as a key
question in the criminal case: Was Cruse insane on the day of the
shootings?
   Allstate maintains in its suit that Cruse was sane and that he
knowingly shot at neighbors in his Palm Bay neighborhood and at
people in the shopping centers. As a result, the company said, the
victims pressing the suit should not be able to collect from the
insurance policy.
   Cruse's attorneys hope to prove to jurors that he was insane on
the day of the shootings and therefore have him cleared of the 36
felony charges.
   In the compensation case, the amount each victim will receive is
open to further negotiations with a cap set at $100,000, said Jim
Nance, attorney for the victims.

   A week of monsoon rains sent logs and
mud crashing into villages and killed at least 142 people, officials
said today.
   Unofficial counts placed the dead at more than 200, with hundreds
missing and believed drowned or buried beneath mud slides that hit
several villages in southern Nakhon Sri Thammarat province.
   The Interior Ministry said at least 70,000 villagers in 12
southern provinces were left homeless, while extensive damage was
reported to roads, bridges, railways and agricultural land.
   Torrential rains in southeast Asia from Saturday to Wednesday
also were blamed for the deaths of dozens of people in Malaysia and
Indonesia. Flood waters washed out thousands of roads, cut off rail
service and destroyed crops in the hardest hit areas, authorities
said.
   Malaysia's state news agency Bernama reported an improvement in
the flood situation in Malaysia, with no new deaths. Earlier
Thursday, authorities said 27 people died from the storms, 14 in the
worst hit state, northeastern Kelantan.
   A spokesman of the Meteorological Department in Kuala Lumpur, the
Malaysian capital, said the weather, part of the annual Asian winter
monsoon season that lasts from November until March, was among the
three worst this decade.
   Monsoon rains lasting three to 10 days this month have lashed
southeast Asia, southern India and Sri Lanka.
   A spokesman for Thailand's Fourth Army, stationed in the south,
said hundreds of rescue workers today recovered 45 bodies from the
mud slides, bringing to 104 the number of dead in Nakhon Sri
Thammarat. Villagers in some areas were being evacuated by troops to
higher ground.
   The U.S. Embassy today said the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance will give $25,000 to relief efforts.
   The worst hit province recorded 17.5 inches of rain Tuesday, a
single-day record for rainfall since data collection began 38 years
ago, the Meteological Department said.
   The English-language newspaper The Nation reported that the
usually bustling tourist city of Hat Yai was reeling from three days
of flash floods, with many businesses closed and hundreds of
Malaysian and other tourists stranded in hotels ``like prisoners.''
   Food was reported scarce in hotels where water was being rationed
to guests.
   Official Radio Thailand said Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan
planned to fly to the disaster area 490 miles south of Bangkok.
   The army spokesman, contacted by telephone, said mud and logs
rolled off barren hillsides in the province's Phipoon District,
crushing people and slamming into homes.
   An inspector of the Forestry Department blamed the deaths on
``serious wounds on the soil and mountains'' inflicted by
uncontrolled logging and mining.

   Staunchly anti-communist South Korea
further expanded its economic contact with communist countries today
by signing an economic cooperation agreement with Poland.
   The pact made Poland the third East European country to conclude
such agreement with South Korea. The others are Hungary and
Yugoslavia.
   South Korea has no diplomatic relations with communist nations
because of its bitter rivalry with communist North Korea. But it has
been seeking non-political contact through business avenues to boost
trade and reduce tension on the Korean peninsula.
   Today's pact was signed in Seoul by Tadeusz Zylkowski, president
of the Polish Chamber of Foreign Trade, and Lee Sun-kee, president
of the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. It calls for the two countries to
cooperate closely for joint venture and other projects.
   They will set up trade offices in each other's capital by the
first half of next year, cooperate for trade exhibitions and
exchange manpower and information on economic development, officials
of both sides said.
   Lee's visit next week to Moscow and Sofia, Bulgaria, is expected
to conclude accords to open trade offices in the Soviet Union and
Bulgaria early next year, Korean officials said.
   The Soviet Union reportedly has approved South Korea's plan to
open trade offices in both Moscow and Vladivostok, an east Asian
Soviet city that South Korea envisions as a window for investment in
the development of Siberia.
   After Hungary became the first communist country to open a trade
office in Seoul last June, Yugoslavia opened a trade office in the
South Korean capital in October.
   South Korea opened trade offices in Budapest, Hungary, last
December and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, this year.
   South Korea and Hungary also were moving toward closer ties. The
two countries announced in September plans to establish
quasi-diplomatic missions in their respective capitals. Talks on a
bilateral investment guarantee agreement were also due to begin in
Seoul next Monday.
   Career diplomat Han Tak-chae was appointed head of South Korea's
permanent mission, with diplomatic status, in Budapest to oversee
trade, cultural and other non-political affairs.
   Han, commenting on improved relations with communist countries,
said those countries were ``changing their policies toward South
Korea and emphasizing practical and realistic aspects.''
   Trade agency officials said negotiations were also under way to
exchange trade offices with East Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   Officials said Seoul already has set up a private business body
to promote trade and investment in China. One recent official report
said Seoul was near an agreement with China to open trade offices
next month in Beijing and Shandong Province, near Korea.
   Trade between South Korea and China was expected to rise to $2
billion this year, up from from $1.5 billion in 1987, trade
officials say. South Korean trade with other communist countries,
however, was still minimal, they said.

<TEXT>
   Israel has returned the press credentials of
three British journalists after suspending them last month on
charges the journalists violated military censorship, the reporters
said today.
   The press cards of the three journalists were suspended Oct. 25,
two days after Reuters ran a story saying undercover army units had
orders to shoot Palestinians suspected of organizing violent
demonstrations.
   The army has denied there are any such underground units.
   Andrew Whitley, a correspondent for the London-based Financial
Times, reported on Oct. 11 that undercover units used Arab cars and
posed as journalists to detain suspected rioters.
   Neither story was submitted to the military censor. Under Israeli
law, journalists must submit reports relating to security matters to
the censors. The government has not clearly identified ``security
matters'' and leaves the submission of reports to the discretion of
correspondents.
   The Government Press Office reinstated the credentials of Paul
Taylor and Steve Weizman of the Reuters news agency without
explanation Tuesday, Taylor said. He said he was not told whether a
police investigation of the case had been dropped.
   Whitley said he got his press card back Nov. 6 and was told the
police investigation was closed.
   Yoram Ettinger, head of the Government Press Office, could not
immediately be reached for comment.
   Journalists whose credentials are suspended cannot interview
government and army officials and are banned from covering
government functions.

<HEAD>Arson Suspected in Fires at Mail Sorting Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 firefighters battled for
several hours today to control two separate fires at Europe's
largest mail sorting office. Officials said arson was suspected.
   Two firefighters were hospitalized overnight for smoke inhalation
but the 500 employees who were in the building when the fires broke
out were safely evacuated, said a spokeswoman from the West Midlands
Fire Brigade.
   The spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
blaze was of ``doubtful origin'' and arson was suspected, since it
first broke out in two separate locations at the letter and parcel
sorting office.
   ``It couldn't possibly have happened accidentally,'' said West
Midlands Assistant Divisional Officer John Whitehead, adding ``there
has been a history of small unexplained fires there.''
   The spokeswoman said 25 fire crews from the Birmingham area were
needed to bring the fire under control by about 4 a.m., three hours
after it was discovered. Firefighters were still in the building at
8:30 a.m., she said.
   The spokeswoman said the fire ``severely damaged'' at least a
third of the ground floor of the four-story building.
   Royal Mail spokeswoman Sally Williams said several hundred
parcels were damaged by fire and water, and machines in the
mechanical parcel sorting area, which handles up to 100,000 items a
day, were destroyed.
   Mike Davis of the Birmingham office said sorting would be done by
hand and some mail would be diverted to other offices but operations
at Europe's largest sorting center would be at near-normal speed by
Monday.

<HEAD>U.N. Says East-West Trade Up, Thanks To Better Political Climate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East-West trade picked up markedly this year thanks
to the improved political climate and to economic reform in most
East European countries, a U.N. report said Thursday.
   But the report projects that the Soviet Union and its six East
European allies will register a slight overall deficit in 1988 after
a combined $2 billion surplus last year. While the volume of exports
increased faster than that of imports, the value of imports rose
more quickly, it said.
   The report was compiled by experts of the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe. Overall figures for the value of the
East-West trade were not given.
   The better atmosphere and the economic reforms have been the
``catalyst for a flurry of contacts, negotiations and agreements,''
the document said. It specifically named large credit facilities
designed to support Western exports to the Soviet Union.
   It said East-West economic cooperation also gained momentum with
a June accord between the Soviet bloc's Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance, known as COMECON, and the European Economic Community,
or EEC. ``This accord .... sets the stage for more intense economic
interchange,'' it said.
   In volume, Soviet exports to the West rose 12 percent during the
first half of 1988 while imports rose 10 percent. But a 23 percent
increase in the value of imports accounted for what the report
called an ``unusually large trade deficit with the West,'' projected
to total $2.4 billion by Dec. 31. Last year, the Soviets ran up a
$800 million surplus.
   In contrast, Moscow's six allies _ Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania _ were forecast to keep a
combined $2 billion trade surplus with the West, compared with $1.2
billion in 1987.
   In volume, exports of the six to the West increased 6 percent
while imports stagnated. In value, exports rose 14 percent while
imports were up 11 percent.
   Bulgaria was the most significant exception, according to the
report. Stagnating sales and a continued import boom led to a
Bulgarian trade deficit with the West of $900 million in the first
six months.

<HEAD>Study Finds Mood-Altering Drugs Still Overused at Nursing Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mood-altering drugs given to many nursing home
patients can cause confusion, uncontrolled shaking and other effects
that make the residents appear sicker than they actually are,
researchers say.
   Little has changed since research a decade ago found that
dangerous drugs were being overused in nursing homes and that
doctors often overlooked better medications with fewer side effects,
said Dr. Mark Beers, chief author of the study in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   Mood-altering ``medications are still being used in enormous
quantity in the nursing homes with a likelihood of deleterious
effect,'' Beers said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles on
Tuesday.
   The drugs may be used because of inadequate staffing or lack of
knowledge by doctors prescribing them, the report says.
   Some commonly prescribed sedatives ``can last several days in old
people and leave them tired, sleepy and potentially confused during
the day,'' Beers said.
   ``What can happen with inappropriate use of psychoactive drugs is
people ... might be considered less functional than they actually
are or more demented than they actually are,'' he said.
   The dangers extend even to death, he said, if disoriented people
fall or if too many drugs cause adverse reactions or aggravate other
conditions.
   Beers and colleagues at Harvard Medical School in Boston studied
drugs given over a one-month period to 850 residents at 12
intermediate-care nursing homes in and around Boston.
   The residents' average age was 85 and 84 percent were women,
according to the study.
   Beers said the nursing homes were considered representative of
the Boston area and Massachusetts, ``an area of the country in which
medical care is supposed to be very good.''
   Sixty-five percent of the residents had orders written for
psychoactive drugs and 53 percent actually took such drugs on five
or more days during the month under scrutiny, the study found.
   Researchers said the drugs included sedatives and sleeping pills;
antipsychotics _ medications to prevent loss of touch with reality;
and drugs that fight depression.
   About one-fifth of the patients had orders written for two such
drugs in the same month, and 7 percent had orders for three or more,
though actual use was somewhat less, they said.
   Statistics for the two-fifths of residents receiving sedatives
and sleeping pills showed 82 percent were getting the drugs on a
regularly scheduled basis, instead of only when there was a specific
need, Beers said.
   ``Reliance on scheduled regimens of psychoactive medicine
indicates that these drugs are not used transiently for periods of
special need,'' the researchers wrote.
   ``Instead, this pattern of use is compatible with the concept of
sedation as `chemical restraint.'''
   Forty-three percent of the drug orders called for use on an
as-needed basis, meaning nurses could decide whether to administer
the drugs.
   ``That's a doctor shirking his duty,'' said Beers, who was a
fellow at Harvard but is now an assistant professor of geriatric
medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles.
   He said doctors might be trying to avoid getting called at odd
hours to be asked about medication for patients.
   Some of the drugs involved can cause confusion, make it difficult
to urinate, cause constipation and lower blood pressure, Beers said.
   Some antipsychotic drugs, a class administered to 26 percent of
patients, can also cause Parkinson's syndrome _ a drug-induced
shaking similar to Parkinson's disease _ and other ailments, he said.
   In a 1976 study by the Office of Long-Term Care of the former
U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, a review of
records of 3,548 nursing home patients found 50 percent on
tranquilizers and in general, ``serious overuse and misuse'' of
drugs among elderly nursing home residents, Beers' study noted.
   ``Things are really no better,'' he said Tuesday.
   Researchers began ``intensive education programs'' at the nursing
homes, and a follow-up study will determine if changes were made, he
said.

<HEAD>PLO Requests U.S. Visa for Arafat to Speak at United Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization
applied to the U.S. Consulate in Tunis today for a visa that would
allow Yasser Arafat into the United States to address the U.N.
General Assembly.
   ``We referred the request to Washington, which is standard
procedure for a visa of this sort,'' said Richard Undeland, U.S.
public affairs officer.
   Zouhdi Labib Terzi, a PLO observer at the United Nations,
presented the visa application to Consul John Noyes, according to
Jamal Sourani, a member of the PLO's executive committee who
accompanied Terzi.
   The United States has not said whether it will grant the visa to
Arafat, leading to confusion over whether the PLO chief will address
the United Nations. He hopes to be present for the General Assembly
debate on the Palestinian question Dec. 1-2.
   Arafat's aides have been referring to the upcoming address as a
matter of fact. Earlier this week, a PLO spokesman said Arafat would
use the speech to ask the General Assembly to grant the new
Palestinian state U.N. membership.
   The PLO was granted U.N. observer status in 1974, following
Arafat's last address before the assembly. In August, the Reagan
administration lost a legal battle to close the PLO's U.N. mission
on grounds the PLO endorses terrorism.
   A U.S. District Court judge supported State Department objections
that closing the office would violate the U.N. Headquarters
Agreement. The United Nations also objected. But the PLO office in
Washington, which is not covered by the U.N. agreement, was closed.
   On Thursday, Arafat told the Qatar news agency that the next
stage of the Palestinian fight ``will be one of a comprehensive and
effective Arab campaign on the regional and international level for
the victory of the Palestinian case and the legitimate and firm
rights of the Palestinian people.''
   Arafat holds an Algerian diplomatic passport issued November 1988
at Algiers, where the PLO's parliament-in-exile met earlier this
month to declare an independent Palestinian state.
   The Nov. 15 declaration of independence follows a nearly yearlong
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least
55 Arab and non-aligned countries have recognized the Palestinian
state.
   The declaration of independence and political program established
during the meeting indirectly recognizes Israel by accepting all
U.N. resolutions including one that calls for all states in the
region to live in peace.
   If Arafat makes the trip to New York, Sourani said he would be
accompanied by about 20 people. A PLO source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the entourage will include the widow of Abu
Jihad, Arafat's top military chief who was assassinated at his Tunis
home in April by a commando unit. The PLO said the unit came from
Israel, but Jerusalem denied the charge.

<HEAD>Rocky Flats Critics Say Damage May be Irreversible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional investigator says damage at
the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant from radioactive materials and
toxic chemicals may be irreversible and even the plant's defenders
admit a cleanup would be costly.
   The Rocky Flats plant, which makes weapons components from
plutonium, has become the target of safety and environmental
concerns over the years. There have been fires, lawsuit settlements
and studies showing higher cancer rates and plutonium contamination.
   ``I don't believe that it's possible to reverse the harm that has
been done at Rocky Flats,'' said Bob Alvarez, who works for the U.S.
Senate's governmental affairs committee, which monitors nuclear
weapons complexes.
   ``I don't think you can retrieve the stuff (solvents mixed with
plutonium) that's migrating down to the groundwater'' at Rocky
Flats, said Alvarez.
   The 385-acre plant site 16 miles northwest of Denver is
surrounded by a 6,550-acre, federally owned buffer zone.
   Fred Dowsett, head of the Colorado Health Department's waste
management division, said concentrations of hazardous compounds in
some groundwater on the plant site are 20,000 times above the
drinking water standard.
   But Dowsett said that in itself poses no threat to local
residents.
   ``The nature of the plant, with a large security zone around it,
means groundwater contamination is confined to the area of the
plant,'' he said. ``There's a large uninhabitated buffer zone before
it can get off site.''
   Officials say all 107 waste sites at Rocky Flats are closely
monitored. The monitoring also has intensified in recent years, they
said.
   But they acknowledge it might cost hundreds of millions, if not
billions, of dollars to undertake an effective cleanup.
   William Fenzel, a General Accounting Office investigator who
headed a recent safety study of Rocky Flats, likened predicting
groundwater flow to forecasting Colorado weather.
   The Department of Energy and its contractor, Rockwell
International, have conceded they lack sufficient information about
groundwater migration, Fenzel said, because they have decided to
drill 200 additional test wells around the plant during the next few
years.
   He said that raises questions about just how polluted the site
actually is.
   ``I think the severity of the problem is such that even if they
spend an enourmous amount of money on cleanup, areas of the site
still may be restricted for decades and even possibly centuries,''
he said.
   Since Rocky Flats opened in 1952, large quantities of toxic,
carcinogenic chemicals and radioactive materials have been handled
at the plant. During the plant's first 25 years of operation, many
of those materials were dumped at the site.
   Some of the deadliest substances _ plutonium, uranium, americium
and chlorinated solvents like trichloroethylene, or TCE;
tetrachloroethylene, PCE; and carbon tetrachloride _ will remain in
the plant's groundwater and soil for decades, if not longer.
   Energy Department and EPA officials acknowledge that errors in
waste disposal were made in the plant's early years, but they
contend that past and present efforts to clean up some of the waste
sites have been successful, and that levels of contaminants are too
low to pose severe health threats.
   ``My professional opinion is that a lot of the contamination can
and will be remediated,'' said Nat Miullo, who oversees the plant
for the EPA.

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Armenian legislators defying

   Armenian legislators today rejected political
changes sought by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and demanded
annexation of a part of neighboring Azerbaijan, residents said.
   The legislative session came as more than 2,000 ethnic Armenians
streamed into Armenia from Azerbaijan, panicked by ethnic rioting
there that killed three soldiers and left more than 126 people
injured earlier this week.
   It was the worst outbreak of violence since February in the
Caucasus, where tensions have run high because of a bitter
territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian
enclave inside Azerbaijan.
   The legal status of the decisions made by about 200 of Armenia's
340 Supreme Soviet members was uncertain, but Armenian activists
called the session a victory for democracy. Residents said the
legislators met in their capital's Opera Theater until 2 a.m. today.
   In Azerbaijan, the chief of information for the Azerbaijan
Foreign Ministry said the situation in the republic's capital, Baku,
remained tense, and that industries in the Caspian Sea port city
were closed by strikes.
   The official, Musa Mamedov, speaking by telephone from Baku, said
soldiers had cordoned off the city's Armenian districts but that for
safety's sake, ``Nobody is going there.''
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
in Moscow on Thursday that tanks and troops were sent to restore
order in Baku and the two Azerbaijan cities where rioting flared
Tuesday, Kirovabad and Nakhichevan.
   Ruben Karagosyan, chief editor of Armenia's official Armenpress
news agency, said by telephone from Yerevan, the republic's capital,
that a curfew was imposed there Thursday night.
   Karagosyan said 2,200 ethnic Armenians who fled the violence in
Azerbaijan had been registered as refugees by a newly created
Armenian government commission. The republic allocated $2.8 million
in aid, he said.
   The Armenian Supreme Soviet, or legislature, broke off its
regular fall session Tuesday after a Kremlin envoy, Arkady Volsky,
said the situation in the Caucasus had become too enflamed to
proceed. The lamwakers had been scheduled to debate the
Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
   About 200 deputies resumed the session Thursday night, enough
members for a quorum, said Victoria Manukyan, chief of local news
for Armenpress.
   Mrs. Manukyan gave no details on the decisions reached. But
Rafael Popoyan, an Armenian activist, said the deputies again
demanded unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia and rejected
the constitutional changes proposed by Gorbachev.
   ``They decided that the constitutional amendments do not
correspond to the interests of Armenia or of democracy, and demanded
that new proposals be drawn up in two months that will meet those
criteria,'' Popoyan said from Yerevan.
   The meeting in the opera house took place in the absence of
Armenia's president and top local Communist Party officials, but
Samson Tonoyan, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, led the session,
Popoyan said. He said Tonoyan announced the decision to a crowd
after the meeting.
   Gorbachev's amendments have provoked strong criticism, especially
in the Baltic republics, where activists argue they would strengthen
Moscow's powers at the expense of the 15 Soviet republics and
eliminate the republics' right to secede. The legal changes are to
be voted on by a special Nov. 29 session of the national Supreme
Soviet.
   The parliaments of Estonia, Latvia and Georgia have demanded
changes in the Gorbachev proposals, and Lithuania has rejected them.
   Both Azerbaijan and the Soviet leadership have rejected any
change in sovereignty for Nagorno-Karabakh, with the Kremlin opting
instead for a long-term economic and social development plan for the
region.
   In February, ethnic riots broke out in the Azerbaijan city of
Sumgait, and at least 32 people, including 26 Armenians, were killed.
   Azerbaijanis said the latest unrest was caused by an illegal
building project carried out by Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh as a
purported attempt to reinforce the Armenian majority there.
   Mamedov reported Thursday that new clashes broke out in
Kirovabad, and said there was an unspecified number of deaths.
However, the Azerbaijani official said today that he had been
reporting ``unofficial information,'' and said he had no official
information about events there.

<HEAD>Britons Encouraged to Visit Atlanta, Via Houston</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   British Airways' in-flight magazine encourages
Britons to beat a path to Atlanta, but it's Houston's skyline that
beckons in the photograph, not the city of Scarlett O'Hara and Ted
Turner.
   An article in Highlife magazine's November edition extolls
Atlanta's virtues: ``It's climate is kindly, it's temperate and
attractive.''
   The Houston photo has publishers stumped.
   ``We wouldn't have asked for a picture of Houston,'' said Rebecca
Francis, an assistant at Headway Publications Ltd. of London, which
publishes about 100,000 copies of the magazine a month for
distribution on the planes.
   She told the Houston Chronicle the mix-up could be a printing
error, but officials would not know until the photos are returned in
``another four weeks.''
   ``That's the first I've heard of it,'' said Robert Harding,
library director of the Robert Harding Picture Library of London,
which is credited with the photo. ``We wouldn't do it intentionally,
that's for sure.''
   ``Oh, that's beautiful,'' British Airway's New York spokesman
John Lampl chuckled when he learned of the error. ``I certainly
don't want to confuse Houston and Atlanta. They are completely
different animals.''
   Ms. Francis said an American reader reported the error several
days ago, but only two complaints had come in. The magazine is
available on non-stop flights between Houston and London.
   In Atlanta, the photo mix-up was a source of amusement for a
Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman who did not want to be quoted by
name.
   ``You're kidding,'' she said when learning of the two-paragraph
article. She recalled that Atlanta and Houston have had somewhat
strained relations ever since the Georgia city beat out the oil city
for this year's Democratic National Convention.
   ``The Houston press was out to get us,'' she said. ``We still
compete for some of the same business.''

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the African National Congress,
the main guerrilla group in South Africa, today held talks with
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other South African churchmen on the
future of that country.
   The ANC described the talks as ``very important,'' and the World
Council of Churches called them ``significant.''
   No statement was released on specifics of the meeting.
   The ANC has met with South African church leaders in the past,
and Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize-winner, has tried in vain to persuade
the group to abandon its policy of violent confrontation with the
state.
   The meeting took place on the last day of a five-day conference
of the church council that focused on the white-led Pretoria
government's destabilization of neighbor states, including Zimbabwe.
   It also came a day after Pretoria announced that Nelson Mandela,
jailed head of the ANC and South Africa's most important black
leader, would not be returned to his prison cell upon his recovery
from tuberculosis at a clinic.
   Mandela, 70, who began treatment for tuberculosis Aug. 1, was
sentenced in 1964 to a life term for sabotage and plotting to topple
the government.

   A portable heater was blamed for a fire that killed a
104-year-old woman and a kitchen stove used for heat started a fire
that killed four boys as holiday blazes claimed eight lives around
the country.
   In Lynn, Mass., a woman escorted her six children to the street
Thursday and then returned to her apartment, locked herself in and
apparently set a fire that killed her, fire officials said. The
victim, Evelyn Iliopoulus, had been released Wednesday from a
psychological counseling center, authorities said.
   Fire Chief Edward Higgins said several couches were set ablaze,
and the stove was turned on with flammable items placed on top of
it. The afternoon blaze forced the evacuation of 32 people and two
firefighters suffered minor injuries.
   Two 4-year-olds died in separate Thanksgiving Day fires in Texas,
and at Dunnellon, Fla., a propane heater in a camper exploded and
burned a family of four, police said.
   Fire officials in Alameda, Calif., said a heater started a fire
in a wall in the home of 104-year-old Fong Shee Wong. Her burned
body was found on the floor of the living room, where she slept,
they said.
   Wong's oldest son, Bryant, 64, said his parents came from China
in 1928 and his father owned a Berkeley restaurant until his death
in 1952. His mother had lived alone for the last 20 years, he said.
   ``She was quite a woman with plenty of gumption,'' he said.
   Four boys aged 11, 9, 9 and 8 died and another was seriously
injured when a fire sparked by a kitchen stove ravaged their home in
Camden, N.J., authorities said. It appeared that the stove had been
used to heat the house, they said.
   Officials said they could not determine all of the relationships
among the children and adults said to be living in the house. A
4-year-old boy was hospitalized in serious condition.
   Fire Inspector Paul Escher said Theresa Van Zant, mother of two
of the boys, was in the house at the time but escaped uninjured.
   ``She was screaming `Help, get the kids out,''' said Hector
Palacios, who lives across the street. ``I went out, and there were
flames from the kitchen. There was just smoke, thick, coming from
the front door. She tried to go up to save her kids, but she
couldn't make it up. I tried to go inside ... I went into the living
room, but it burned my eyes.''
   A heater apparently started a fire in the central Texas town of
Comanche that killed one boy and hospitalized his parents and two
younger sisters with severe burns, fire officials said.
   And in the east Texas community of Hemphill, authorities said a
4-year-old boy was killed in a house fire and his brother
hospitalized in the Shrine Burn Center in Galveston.
   At Dunnellon, Fla., the camper heater blast hospitalized John and
Julie Roof in critical condition and their two children were in fair
condition, said Shands Hospital spokeswoman Jennifer Fanzlow.
   ``He was attempting to light it, and it exploded,'' Ms. Fanzlow
said. ``Whether it was a malfunction of the heater or it was his
fault in lighting it, we don't know at this point.''

   The municipal council in the
industrial town of Boksburg has voted to ban blacks from public
facilities that were open to all races for the past few years, a
town official said today.
   Town Clerk Johann Coetsee said the recently elected town
councilors voted 17 to 12 Thursday night to ban blacks from the
municipal lake, swimming pools, town hall and tennis courts.
   About 50 residents attended the meeting in Boksburg, 30 miles
east of Johannesburg. The town has a population of 87,000 whites,
110,000 blacks and 36,000 people of mixed race who live in separate
townships.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party gained control of the
Boksburg town council in the Oct. 26 municipal election. The
Conservatives won control of about 100 municipalities in the the
Transvaal and Orange Free State provinces.
   The party does not have control of parliament and cannot reverse
national policy, but it says it plans to institute strict apartheid
in the cities and towns it controls.
   In recent years, white authorities in most areas have been doing
away with segregation of public facilities.
   The Conservative Party has said it would not necessarily call for
reposting ``Whites Only'' signs, but might employ more subtle means
of carrying out its segregation policies.
   Some segregated facilities in South Africa now have the sign:
``Right of Admission Reserved.''
   In Boksburg, the councilors voted to put up ``Whites Only'' signs
at only one public facility, Boksburg Lake, a 37-acre former dam
surrounded by terraces, lawns, gardens and trees.
   Coetsee said that after a fence is erected around the lake, the
signs would be taken down, but the area would remain open only to
whites.
   He said the council majority decided to bar non-whites from using
the town hall because the townships have new community halls that
are ``better than the whites' hall.''
   The town's swimming pool had previously allowed non-whites to use
it only for organized competitions. But the council decided Thursday
that it would be only for whites, except in the case of a non-white
foreigner competing in an international competition in Boksburg.
   The council also rescinded a decision by the previous council
that allowed tennis clubs to have integrated membership if they so
desired.

   French President Francois Mitterrand arrived today
in Moscow on a two-day visit for talks with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and to witness the launch of a joint Soviet-French space
mission.
   The official Tass news agency said Mitterrand was greeted at the
airport by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Vice
President Anatoly Lukynov.
   Mitterrand was to meet Gorbachev in the Kremlin, then travel
Saturday to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia for the
launch of a team of Soviet and French cosmonauts for the Soviet's
orbiting Mir space station.
   The team will remain in space until Dec. 21 and is expected to
perform a wide-ranging series of experiments, including continuing
medical and biological tests started in 1982 by the first
Soviet-French space crew.
   Twenty-two years ago France became the first West European
country to sign an agreement with the Soviet Union to cooperate in
space studies.
   Nikolai Afanasyevsky, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said
Wednesday the Soviets are hoping Mitterrand's visit will help
strengthen Soviet-French dialogue, which he said had ``noticeably
weakened'' in recent years.

<HEAD>Spain Approves Text of New Defense Pact With United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spain's Cabinet today approved the text of a
new eight-year defense agreement with the United States that forces
the removal of 72 U.S. F-16 fighter bombers by 1992, a spokesman
said.
   Spokesman Guillermo Una told The Associated Press the Cabinet
approval means the accord will go soon for ratification before
parliament, where the governing Socialist party has a comfortable
majority.
   Spanish negotiator Maximo Cajal and U.S. Ambassador Reginald
Bartholomew signed the texts in Spanish and English on Thursday at
the Foreign Ministry, ending negotiations that began in July 1986.
   The two nations first signed a military cooperation treaty in
1953, during the height of the Cold War under the authoritarian
government of Gen. Francisco Franco.
   In the new agreement, Spain will not receive any U.S. military
aid in exchange for U.S. armed forces' use of two air bases, a major
naval station and nine communications posts.
   In January, both sides reached a tentative agreement for a new
accord in which the United States accepted Spain's principal demand
that the U.S. Air Force withdraw its 401st Tactical Wing of 72 F-16
fighter bombers from the joint U.S.-Spanish air base at Torrejon
just east of the Spanish capital.
   Italy has agreed to provide a new home base for the jets and the
3,600 U.S. troops and 600 civilians attached to the unit.
   The new agreement says no more than 8,000 U.S. troops and 1,000
U.S. civilians employed by the military can be based in Spain at one
time.
   The negotiations stemmed from a 1986 referendum in which Spanish
voters chose to remain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on
condition that the U.S. military presence be substantally reduced.
   Two other conditions approved in the NATO referendum were that
Spain prohibit the transport, storage or introduction of nuclear
weapons and that Spain's armed forces remain outside the integrated
NATO military command.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials have identified a second body
among the the seven found buried in the yard of a boardinghouse,
this time the remains of a man named in the only murder charge
against the home's owner.
   Meanwhile, the national attention given to a 59-year-old Los
Angeles man who helped lead police to the boardinghouse owner
brought about a reunion with three children he hadn't seen in more
than 30 years.
   The body, identified by fingerprints, is Alvaro ``Bert'' Montoya,
a spokesman for the Sacramento County coroner's office who requested
anonymity said Thursday.
   The only other body identified so far is that of 55-year-old
Benjamin Fink, described by his family as a chronic alcoholic and
transient who moved into the home operated by Dorothea Montalvo
Puente earlier this year.
   Autopsies have been completed on the victims, but causes of death
have not been determined. Court documents indicate that one police
search of Puente's home turned up 14 bottles of pills and various
unknown substances.
   Among the items seized were a book titled ``150 Commonly
Prescribed Drugs,'' an 8-inch kitchen knife, a quilt with possible
blood stains, a coffee can with ``lye'' imprinted on the lid and a
book called ``The Smell of Evil.''
   Police believe Puente killed the boarders for their Social
Security checks.
   Social workers and neighbors who reported people missing led
police to question Puente, who was interviewed by police after the
first body was discovered. She was allowed to walk away by
authorities, who said they had insufficient grounds to hold her. She
fled the area, and was captured five days later at a downtown Los
Angeles hotel.
   Sacramento police, using a plane provided by a television station
news department, flew to Burbank, retrieved Puente and returned her
to custody in Sacramento.
   The department's actions in letting her go and then using a TV
station's plane to transport her have been criticized in newspaper
editorials and by Puente's court-appointed public defenders.
   Sacramento Mayor Anne Rudin said late Tuesday that she has asked
the state Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training to
examine the Sacramento department.
   Michael Di Miceli, a commission official, said Wednesday the
review would take 45 to 90 days.
   On Tuesday, police detectives met with Social Security officials
to obtain the records of 16 missing tenants of Puente's
boardinghouse. Police want the payment records of people reported
missing after living at the home, hoping to determine whether their
Social Security checks were improperly cashed.
   Detectives believe the bodies found in the yard may be among
those on the list of names.
   Charles Willgues Sr., who left his wife and three children in
Detroit for reasons the family won't discuss, met a woman he later
recognized as Puente earlier this month in a Los Angeles bar. He
called a television station, and she was soon taken into custody.
   Last week, a television reporter looking for Willgues visited his
previous apartment, and learned that the manager there was holding a
letter for him. The letter was from his daughter, Debbie Sculley.
Just weeks before, she had tracked him to his old address.
   Willgues was soon on the telephone to the Detroit-area city of
Taylor, where his children Charles Jr., 35, Sculley and Linda
Willgues live.
   ``He says, `Hello Chuck?' My jaw just about dropped,'' the son
said Tuesday. ``Then he said, `I don't know where to begin.' And I
said, `I don't either.'
   ``I was just at a loss for words,'' said the younger Willgues.
``I was crying on the phone.''
   After several calls discussing the past, the family now is hoping
to arrange a Christmas reunion.

<HEAD>Formal Charges Filed Against Restaurateur in Hit-and-Run Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The motorist who ended a 2{-year
controversy over lawyer-client privilege by confessing to the
hit-and-and-run death of a 28-year-old man has been charged with
leaving the scene of an accident involving injury.
   State Attorney's officials charged William D. Morser, a
restaurateur from nearby Delray Beach, on Tuesday with the
third-degree felony charge on which Morser had been arrested earlier.
   Mark Baltes was killed March 9, 1986, when he was struck by a car
on South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach.
   The case drew national attention when it was learned that the
driver of the hit-and-run vehicle had hired a lawyer the day after
the accident. That lawyer refused to disclose the name of his
client, citing the attorney-client privilege of confidentiality.
   Morser on Nov. 5 identified himself as the driver and gave a
confession under subpoena, meaning it cannot be used against him in
a criminal trial.
   Morser, 55, said he does not think he can be faulted for his
actions.
   He blamed Baltes for being in the road in the middle of the
night. Baltes, had a blood alcohol level of 0.26 percent, more than
2{ times the legal intoxication level in Florida.
   Morser said he didn't realize he had hit a person until he read a
newspaper the next day. After learning that a man had been killed,
he decided to seek a lawyer's advice.
   In the ensuing months, Morser's attorney, Barry Krischer, refused
to disclose his client's identification despite a lawsuit brought by
Baltes' parents. Last month a Palm Beach County judge ruled that
Krischer could not be compelled to disclose the identity.
   Investigators first suspected Morser two days before his
confession after inspecting his white Buick Riviera, which resembles
the car that struck Baltes. He is free on bond.

   Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani said today his country would use its influence to help
free nine American hostages in Lebanon if the United States would do
the same for Iranian hostages there.
   ``If you are interested in having your people held hostage in
Lebanon released, then tell the Phalangists to release our people
who have been in their hands for years, and of whom we do not have
any news,'' official Tehran radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying.
   Speaking at a Friday prayer sermon, Rafsanjani, also the army's
commander in chief, said if the United States helped free Iranian
hostages ``we will also suggest to our well-wishers and friends in
Lebanon to release any hostages they may have.''
   Iranian officials have made similar statements in the past.
   Three Iranians, Ahmad Motevaselian, Hussein Musavi and Kazem
Akhavan, were kidnapped by right-wing Christian Phalangist gunmen in
northern Lebanon in 1982. Their Lebanese driver, who also had an
Iranian passport, disappeared with them. They are widely believed to
be dead.
   The Rt. Rev. John Brown, Anglican bishop for the Persian Gulf
region, went to Lebanon in July hoping to track down the Iranian
hostages. He went at the request of the Archbishop of Canterbury
whose special envoy, Terry Waite, was kidnapped in January 1987.
   The Tehran radio broadcast was monitored in Nicosia.
   In Beirut, a magazine reported today that British hostages held
in Lebanon will be freed soon because Britain and Iran have restored
ties.
   The weekly Ash-Shiraa attributed its report to unidentified
informed sources. ``The British hostages held in Lebanon will be
freed soon now that Britain and Iran have resumed full diplomatic
relations,'' it said.
   The report could not be independently confirmed. Ash-Shiraa
gained international fame when it broke the story of secret U.S.
arms sales to Iran in return for the release of hostages in 1986.
But the weekly, published in Moslem west Beirut, has not been
accurate lately in its reports about the hostages.
   Britain and Iran resumed full diplomatic relations Nov. 11.
   London broke relations with Tehran in June 1987 after an Iranian
envoy was arrested on shoplifting charges in Manchester, northern
England, and a British diplomat was assaulted by militants in Tehran.
   There are 14 foreign hostages held in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. In addition, a Swiss Red Cross official was kidnapped in
the southern port of Sidon on Nov. 17, but no one has claimed
responsibility.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by
pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Waite, journalist John
McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual British
and Irish nationality whose release is also sought by the Irish
government.
   The British Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec
Collett, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian
abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found.
   The longest-held foreign hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   An animal rights group claimed
responsibility for a blaze at a fur store that missed valuable pelts
but ruined a Santa Claus outfit.
   No one was injured in the three-alarm fire Thursday at Del
Conte's Furriers.
   A statement read to The Associated Press by a caller claiming to
be part of a group called the Animal Liberation Front said the fur
industry is ``a perverse business which needlessly murders millions
of animals each year to provide humans with deplorable status
symbols.''
   ``The ALF will continue its war against this Nazism until the
bloody fur trade is abolished from our society forever,'' the
statement said.
   The words ``ALF'' and ``No More'' were spray painted on the side
of the store.
   Fire Capt. Bob Waldron said the cause of the fire was under
investigation.
   ``Fortunately, none of the valuable things were destroyed. They
were all in the safe,'' said the store's owner, Eva Del Conte, who
declined to estimate the damage.
   She said the store would not reopen. It had been advertising a
retirement clearance sale.
   The Santa Claus outfit was to be worn tonight at a tree-lighting
ceremony sponsored by a merchants association, Del Conte said.
``They burned Santa Claus,'' she said.
   When firefighters arrived, the attic and roof of the wood-frame
building were ablaze.
   In June, the ALF claimed it stole two calves from a Santa Rosa
veal ranch. A barn was spray painted with slogans.

   Three teen-agers leaving a high school football

   Thursday's shooting reflected the increased access to guns by
students, said Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke.
   ``For some of them, the handgun has replaced the fist as a means
of expressing their rage and frustration,'' he said.
   Four shots were fired from a .25-caliber pistol only 20 yards
from the main stadium gate, hitting one of those arguing and two
bystanders, police said. One victim was in serious condition with
chest wounds but the other two were in satisfactory condition with
minor leg wounds, authorities reported. No arrest had been made.
   At least eight incidents involving firearms have been reported in
city schools since classes began in September, and more than 30

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes today attacked two bases
operated by Palestinian guerrillas and Lebanese militiamen near this
southern port city, and police said five people were killed and 15
wounded.
   The Israeli army confirmed the raid, saying its planes destroyed
a large ammunition depot before returning safely.
   At least four jetfighters took turns rocketing the bases on
Sidon's northeastern edge in two attacks five minutes apart, a
police spokesman said.
   The rockets demolished a single-story building camouflaged in an
olive grove, said the spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
police regulations. He said the bases belonged to the Marxist
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine headed by George
Habash and the Popular Nasserite Organization, a predominantly Sunni
Moslem Lebanese militia.
   An adjacent one-story building used by the Popular Nasserite
Organization also was damaged, according to police.
   They identified the dead as three Nasserite militiamen and two
Popular Front guerrillas. Among the wounded were six militiamen,
police said.
   Smoke billowed from the bases, and air raid sirens were heard in
Sidon and the adjacent refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh,
said the police spokesman.
   An adjacent base for the radical Fatah-Revolutionary Council
group was not hit in the raid, the spokesman said. The group is
headed by Palestinian terrorist mastermind Sabri al-Banna, also
known as of Abu Nidal.
   Abu Nidal's organization has claimed responsibility for scores of
terrorist attacks, including those at Rome and Vienna airports in
December 1985.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council defenders and other guerrillas in the
nearby refugee camps shot at the jetfighters with twin-barrelled,
anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were observed, the spokesman said.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said the warplanes destroyed a
large ammunition depot and returned safely to base.
   The brief dispatch gave no further details.
   Witnesses said the Israeli jetfighters flew low over the
Mediterranean and the coastal highway at the northern entry to
Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, causing several auto accidents.
Panicking drivers abandoned their cars as the jets roared overhead
and sought refuge in banana and orange groves, said one witness, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The raid, Israel's 23rd air attack on Lebanon this year, came
three days after Israeli jetfighters and helicopter gunships
attacked a guerrilla checkpoint at the western entrance to the Ein
el-Hilweh camp, killing six people and wounding nine.
   By police count, 114 people were killed and 318 wounded in
Israel's previous 22 air strikes into Lebanon since Jan. 3.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have pulled the plug on an
experimental radio-wave device intended to heat malignant tumors
inside the body and make them stop growing.
   The Food and Drug Administration said in a letter that
researchers have failed to prove the device works on tumors deep in
the body or that it is safe for patients and technicians.
   Researchers responded that 10 years of research has shown that
the heat treatment, while not a cure, often relieves patients' pain
and extends lives, the Los Angeles Times said.
   ``There is no scientific basis whatever for what the FDA has
done,'' said Dr. F. Kristian Storm III, chairman of surgical
oncology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
   Storm, who helped design the device, has been testing it with the
assistance of 12 researchers at nine institutions, including the
University of California, Los Angeles.
   In a letter dated Oct. 6, Robert Sheridan, acting director of
FDA's Office of Device Evaluation, told Storm the government was
withdrawing approval of the so-called magnetrode hyperthermia system
concentric coil applicator.
   The letter said researchers have failed to monitor patients'
internal temperatures during treatments and that the device could
leak ``potentially significant levels'' of radiation.
   The Times quoted unidentified researchers as saying they have
told the FDA they would monitor the temperature of tumors and
internal organs during initial treatments but are unwilling to do so
on a repeated basis during follow-up treatments because the probes
are potentially hazardous to cancer victims.
   The manufacturer of the system, Henry Radio and Henry Medical
Electronics Inc. of Los Angeles, acknowledged there is potential for
radiation leaks, but insisted such leaks fall within established
safety limits and that all technicians take precautions.

<HEAD>Home Sales Fall Despite Slight Decline In Mortgage Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes fell for a second
straight month in October even though mortgage rates declined
slightly during the month, a real estate trade group reported today.
   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million
units last month.
   The 1.1 percent October decline followed a similar 1.1 percent
September drop. Sales had been up 2.2 percent in August after
falling 4.5 percent in July.
   The pattern of declines in three of the past four months
indicated that sales have cooled, analysts said.
   ``The summer rush is over, and despite the window of opportunity
afforded by low mortgage interest rates in October, the surge of
home sales we saw earlier this year has run its course,'' said John
Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist.
   Tuccillo predicted that sales for all of 1988 would be very close
to the 3.5 million homes sold for all of 1987.
   The decline in sales was accompanied by a small drop in prices.
The median cost of an existing home sold in October was $88,100,
down $100 from the September level. However, the price was still 4.1
percent higher than a year ago, when the median home price was
$84,600.
   The weakness in October reflected a 2.9 percent drop in sales in
the West, which fell to an annual rate of 700,000 units. This offset
a 2.2 percent rise in home sales in the Midwest, where the annual
rate edged down to 960,000 units.
   Sales in the South were unchanged at 1.39 million units, but this
represented an increase of 8.6 percent from a year ago, reflecting
perhaps some improvement in depressed conditions in the oil belt.
   Sales in the Northeast were also unchanged at an annual rate of
650,000 units.

   A bomb blast today damaged the family tomb
of military President Augusto Pinochet on his 73rd birthday.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which
marred a day of ceremonies in homage to the right-wing leader.
   The bomb went off just behind the tomb shortly after 10 a.m. at
the city's General Cementery, about 20 blocks north of downtown
Santiago, cementery director Arturo Urrutia told The Associated
Press.
   The explosion shattered stained glass windows, religious icons
and flowerpots in and around the concrete-walled mausoleum.
Reporters who went to the site also found that several nearby crypts
also were damaged.
   Urrutia first said the explosion blew open the steel doors of the
mausoleum, but the damage turned out to be less extensive than he
thought.
   A second bomb was found and defused by police explosives experts,
according to security officials at the scene. They said the
mausoleum is guarded around the clock, and that the bombs apparently
were planted when a police guard briefly left his post to visit the
cementery's offices.
   Leftist extremist groups have been active in Chile since the
early 1980s, occasionally attacking military and political targets.
   Pinochet, who was born Nov. 25, 1915, seized power in a bloody
1973 coup that toppled an elected leftist government. In October, he
lost a referendum on extending his rule eight more years and is
obliged to call open elections, planned for December 1989, to pick a
successor.
   The president began his birthday celebrations in the central port
city of Valparaiso with a serenade from a military band in front of
his residence. He later went to the presidential palace, where
military and government officials paid him homage and a folk group
performed traditional dances.

   Americans shared a bounty of food and good will Thanksgiving Day,
offering plates heaped high to thousands of needy as descendants of
American Indians and Pilgrims recalled the spirit of peace that
prevailed at the first Thanksgiving.
   Football games and parades also captured the attention of
millions of spectators and television viewers on Thursday's holiday.
Parades featuring towering cartoon-character balloons, opulent
floats and miles of marching bands streamed through the streets of
New York, Philadelphia, Detroit and Houston to herald the start of
the holiday season.
   Of course, Americans sat down at family dinner tables to feast on
the traditional turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and gravy while
offering thanks.
   President-elect George Bush and his wife, Barbara, spent a quiet
Thanksgiving at their seaside vacation home in Maine; President
Reagan and his wife Nancy gathered with relatives and friends in
Santa Barbara, Calif.; and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle had a
quiet dinner with his family in Indiana.
   Soviet inspectors in this country monitoring compliance with a
U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons treaty could not do the same because,
under a Defense Department security policy, they cannot accept
invitations to private homes.
   But six members of the Soviet team assigned to the Hercules Inc.
aerospace plant in Magna, Utah, attended services at the First
Presbyterian Church in Salt Lake City, then sat down to a
traditional Thanksgiving dinner at the church.
   Team spokesman Vladimir Zhukov said it was the group's first
Thanksgiving and he pronounced the holiday ``uniquely'' American.
   Rosemary A. Holt, president of Women Concerned About Nuclear War,
said the rules against home visits ``thwart the development of
better relations between our two countries and encourage the old
mentality that `we need to have an enemy.'''
   Thousands of needy people packed shelters and restaurants across
the country to dine on free hearty meals and enjoy the holiday's
good cheer.
   ``Thank God for places for this,'' said Henry Scott, a homeless
man dining at the Masonic Temple in Paterson, N.J. ``I'm making it
by the skin of my teeth. I'm trying not to resort to being
incarcerated.''
   In San Francisco, about 7,200 people, served by 600 volunteers,
feasted on a traditional holiday meal at the Glide Memorial United
Methodist Church, which has served Thanksgiving dinner to the needy
for 15 years.
   The Rev. Cecil Williams said the turnout was the largest ever and
had more women and children than past years. Women and children made
up about 35 percent of Thursday's turnout, compared with about 20
percent last year, Williams said.
   In Scott, Ark., residents gave thanks just to be alive following
a spate of deadly tornadoes last week that ripped across the state,
killing six people, three from Scott.
   Suzy Cotham's country store near the Lonoke-Pulaski county line
opened its doors Thursday to scores of residents whose homes and
businesses were swept away by the twisters.
   ``You don't realize how people are until something like this
happens, and then you find out they do have a heart, even though
they act tough and everything,'' said Mrs. Cotham.
   Homer Adams, 28, herded his three small sons to a table. ``We
would have been without Thanksgiving if not for all this,'' he said.
   Besides the spirit of giving, Thanksgiving also provoked a sense
of reconciliation between descendants of American Indians and
Pilgrims who gathered at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New
York.
   ``What we are doing tonight is an act of deep respect and deep
affection between the people who came to this country and the people
who were there first,'' said the Rev. James Parks Morton.
   Chief Oren Lyons of the Onondaga tribe said he attended ``to join
in this celebration of reconciliation, to bring spirituality back
into Thanksgiving, and to bring people together in the way that it's
supposed to be.''
   About 12 tribes from 20 states were represented in the crowd of
4,000. The event ended when the participants joined hands in a
circle dance of friendship.
   On a lighter note, hundreds of high school bands struck up a
brisk tempo for parades across the country, with most of the major
events coming off without a hitch.
   In New York, Snoopy, Woodstock and the Pink Panther and other
giant helium-filled balloons flew alongside 24 floats, 14 marching
bands, hundreds of clowns and 400 cheerleaders at the 62nd annual
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
   In Detroit, about 900,000 spectators turned out for a parade
featuring clowns, floats and marching bands. In Houston, parade
organizers said they were thankful for the good weather that brought
a record turnout.
   But in Philadelphia, a feisty 75-foot-tall Olive Oyl balloon
refused to stand up for the parade. With the help of about a dozen
handlers, she eventually rose for the occasion to join that city's
69th annual Thanksgiving Day parade, the nation's oldest.
   ``She looks like the rest of us this morning,'' said Dori Hall,
37, who helped raise the Popeye cartoon character. ``I was thinking
I didn't want to get up either.''

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers Cut Tentative Deal To Limit Production</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with crude prices up but analysts
skeptical agreement will hold long. No pickup.
^By SALLY JACOBSEN</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude prices shot up today following a
tentative OPEC deal to end a bitter dispute over production between
Iran and Iraq and reduce the cartel's output. Analysts were
skeptical the pact would last.
   OPEC ministers predicted oil prices would jump to $18 a barrel if
the accord is signed. Prices have been at least $4 lower in recent
months.
   Analysts said they did not believe OPEC members could restrain
production for more than a few months, if at all.
   A rise to $18 a barrel theoretically could add up to 10 cents to
the price of a gallon of gasoline, but analysts said they doubted
that would happen because retail prices did not fall during the
recent slump in crude prices.
   The tentative deal worked out by the ministers of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to limit their
production next year was announced late Thursday.
   Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, flew to Tehran today
to get his government's approval for the pact, which sets a ceiling
on OPEC's production at 18.5 million barrels a day in the first half
of 1989.
   Analysts estimate OPEC has been producing more than 21 million
barrels a day recently, far above the cartel's current cap of about
15 million barrels.
   Issam Abdul Raheem Chalabi, the Iraqi minister, also expressed
confidence the agreement would push crude prices back to OPEC's
benchmark of $18 a barrel. Prices have been at least $4 lower in
recent months. ``I think we can reach that ($18 price) within a few
months,'' Chalabi said.
   But analysts remained skeptical that an accord would lead to $18
oil in the near future.
   ``If they have an agreement, the market will take it as a good
deal and prices will go up,'' said Cyrus Tahmassebi, an economist
for Ashland Oil Inc. ``But once the realities of the market hit,
prices will come down again, and sharply.''
   Tahmassebi said among the realities are that the market needs
only about 17 million barrels a day of oil from OPEC, well below the
18.5 million cap the cartel proposed.
   In London, futures prices rose between $1.55 and $1.65 a barrel
for Brent crude, the benchmark grade for North Sea oil. Analysts
said they did not expect prices to go much higher before coming down
again in the weeks ahead.
   Oil trading in the United States was closed for the Thanksgiving
holiday.
   Analysts say each $1 rise in the price of a barrel of oil
theoretically adds 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices.
   The ministers opened their winter meeting Monday but postponed
further discussions until Saturday to give them time to end the
stalemate between Iran and Iraq, which agreed to a cease-fire in
August in their eight-year war.
   The ministers want the production agreement to dry up some of the
glut on the market so prices will go up.
   The major stumbling block to the accord, which would replace one
drawn up in 1986, has been the Iran-Iraq dispute.
   Iraq has been insisting that its production quota, or ceiling, in
any new pact be the same as Iran's. Aghazadeh repeatedly said no.
   It was not known exactly how that dispute was resolved.
   Aghazadeh said Iran would retain its share of total cartel output
at 14.27 percent. ``I received a new proposal in which my main
concern, which is to preserve my percentage share, is taken into
consideration,'' he said.
   With a ceiling of 18.5 million barrels, this would give Iran a
quota of 2.64 million barrels a day. Its current cap is 2.4 million
barrels.
   ``As for the Iraqi quota, 11 members have agreed to donate part
of their share to that country,'' Aghazadeh said. ``Insofar as this
particular issue is concerned, I find it necessary to consult with
my government.
   ``But other issues, I have agreed to,'' he said.
   Aghazadeh did not say how large Iraq's quota would be under the
plan. Its ceiling was set at 1.5 million barrels under the current
pact, although it has refused to honor that level.
   Asked if he was still refusing to allow Iraq the same quota as
Iran, he replied, ``This is exactly the issue which I have to
consult with my government.''
   ``If Tehran agrees that other countries could donate part of
their share to Iraq, we will be able to have a strong agreement,''
he said.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates
and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Paint-Covered Crack Blamed For Carnival Accident, Investigators Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout to add comment from state official today,
quote from carnival operator and shooting occurring among mourners</NOTE>
<DATELINE>HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A paint-covered crack has been blamed for
the collapse of a whirling, dipping carnival ride that killed a
17-year-old girl and injured six others, state investigators said.
   An inspection of the ``Monster'' ride Thursday at the Broward
County Fair showed that one of its six arms had collapsed at the
spot of a tiny metal fracture, a crack that went unnoticed in
previous inspections because it was painted over, said Wally Rich,
director of the state's Bureau of Fairs and Expositions. Rust under
the paint indicted it had been there fore some time, he said today.
   The on-site inspection showed no signs of negligence or improper
inspection, however, he said.
   With six inspectors and 1,161 carnival rides licensed in Florida
last year, it's unrealistic to expect inspections with the time and
sophisticated equipment that would have been needed to detect the
tiny crack, Rich said.
   ``It would be almost impossible for us to carry out a program of
that magnitude,'' he said.
   The broken arm and the arm opposite will be studied by a
metallurgist at Florida Atlantic University, he said. His inspectors
will sand-blast the other four arms to search for any other defects.
   James E. Strates Shows, which owns and operates the Broward
fair's midway, purchased the 10-year-old ride in the early 1980s,
according to the state investigators.
   ``We're terribly sorry this thing happened,'' said Ben E.
Braunstein, a spokesman for the Orlando-based Strates Shows. ``This
was purely and simply an accident.''
   Christie Schafale died of head injuries suffered in Wednesday's
accident. Her brother-in-law, Christopher Burch, 23, was
hospitalized in stable condition with fractured ribs and chest
injuries. Five others were treated for injuries.
   Only hours after the accident, a shooting at a house where
friends of Ms. Schafale had gathered left one youth dead and a
second charged with murder, police said.
   Peter Tersigni, 19, had been arguing with Sean Stemmerman, 18,
and Stemmerman picked up a shotgun and aimed it at Tersigni's chest,
police said witnesses told them.
   When Tersigni said, ``Go ahead, shoot me,'' Stemmerman fired,
killing the youth, police said. Stemmerman was charged with
first-degree murder Thursday and held without bail at the Broward
County Jail.

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's government Friday defended its
banning of a reformist Soviet magazine, charging the publication
contains articles that distort history.
   ``Distorted portrayals of the historical achievements of the
Soviet people, spread in East Germany, are unacceptable in view of
our friendship with the Soviet Union,'' said a commentary in the
East German Communist Party organ Neues Deutschland.
   The banned magazine Sputnik contains a selection of articles from
the Soviet press. Recent issues have included frank appraisals of
the Stalin era, along with letters and commentaries critical of
Kremlin politics.
   Its ban has provoked public protest. Witnesses reported East
German security officials arrested a man who held up a handmade
poster protesting the ban and demanding freedom of the press.
   Radio Moscow on Tuesday defended the magazine in a
German-language commentary heard in Berlin, saying the publication
``mirrors a plurality of opinion in the Soviet press.''

   Atomic bomb survivors and other Hiroshima residents
Friday held their 400th protest against nuclear testing,
participants and city officials said.
   Protest leader Ichiro Moritaki said about 150 people demonstrated
in silence for an hour in Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park,
protesting nuclear tests this past week by France and the Soviet
Union.
   The park is near the spot where a U.S. atomic bomb exploded in
1945, killing an estimated 140,000 people and destroying much of the
city.
   City officials said it was the 400th such protest since 1973,
when residents began demonstrations against every announced nuclear
test by any nation.
   To mark the 400th protest, the group adopted a statement calling
for nuclear disarmament and an end to nuclear testing, Moritaki
said. It will be sent to governments of Britain, China, France,
India, the Soviet Union and the United States.
   The United States dropped the bomb on Hiroshima in the closing
days of World War II. Three days later, about 70,000 more people
died in a second U.S. atomic attack on the city of Nagasaki, also in
southwestern Japan.

   Authorities seized a Taiwanese boat
Friday for fishing illegally in the South Pacific island nation's
exclusive economic zone, state radio said.
   Radio Apia said the vessel was based in neighboring American
Samoa and that charges would be filed against the skipper of the
boat.

   Radio Apia said a Western Samoan patrol seized the boat Thursday
about 60 miles off Cape Asau. It arrived in Apia harbor Friday
following a journey across rough seas, the radio said.

   Workers have dismantled a specially built
round table that was to have been used for discussions between the
government and opposition, the government said Friday.
   ``The table could not be blocking a room where different meetings
and symposiums are usually held,'' said Zbigniew Augustynowicz, of
the government press office.
   He said the table could be reassembled quickly if the talks are
rescheduled.
   Last week, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Interior Minister
Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak failed to reach agreement on holding the
talks, but agreed to continue contacts with the goal of bringing
their positions closer together.
   A Communist Party source, who demanded anonymity, said this week
the talks were not expected to take place before February, after a
major party conference on ideology.
   Kiszczak and Walesa had agreed to the talks Aug. 31 during
Poland's worst labor unrest in seven years. They are supposed to
cover broad social questions, including Solidarity's future and
economic and political pluralism in Poland.

   Jury selection began today in the murder
trial of three members of a polygamist clan accused in the killing
of a law enforcement officer during a 13-day standoff at the clan's
farm.
   John Timothy Singer, 22, Addam Swapp, 27, and his brother,
Jonathan, 21, are charged in the Jan. 28 death of state corrections
Lt. Fred House.
   Some 200 potential jurors showed up at the North Summit
Elementary School to be interviewed by attorneys and 3rd District
Judge Michael Murphy. About 50 members of the original jury pool of
250 already have been disqualified because of illness or other
insurmountable problems, said Detective Sgt. Robert Berry of the
Summit County sheriff's office.
   Jury selection was moved to the school, where tight security was
enforced, because there was insufficient room to seat all the
potential jurors at the Summit County Courthouse, Berry said.
   House was shot as police moved in to end the standoff. He was
urging a police dog to attack the Swapp brothers when he was hit,
and prosecutors contend the wheelchair-bound Singer fired the fatal
shot. Investigators testified he told them he was firing at the
police dogs.
   The clan had holed up on the farm at Marion, in northeastern
Utah, after bombing a Mormon chapel, an act Addam Swapp said had
been ordered by God as a sign of impending collapse of the Mormon
Church and all government. He said it would trigger the resurrection
of John Singer, the father of John Timothy Singer and of Swapp's two
wives.
   The three defendants and Vickie Singer, 45, widow of John Singer,
were convicted in federal court on charges stemming from the bombing
and standoff. Addam Swapp was sentenced to 15 years in prison, Mrs.
Singer to five years and Jonathan Swapp and John Timothy Singer to
10 years.
   Jonathan Swapp was married Tuesday in a civil ceremony at the
Summit County Jail, his attorney, Earl Spafford, said Wednesday.
Swapp married Ann Eaton, 20, Salem, Utah, who first saw him on
television and then attended the federal court trial.

   About 1,000 radical students and
Buddhist monks hurled firebombs at riot police Friday, demanding
that disgraced former President Chun Doo-hwan be arrested on
corruption charges.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan,'' shouted the protesters in the streets
of the capital. They threw hundreds of firebombs at police, who
responded with tear gas.
   The protesters also denounced President Roh Tae-woo, accusing him
of trying to protect Chun, an old friend and former associate. Roh
is scheduled to appear on nationwide TV at 10 a.m. Saturday (8 p.m.
EST Friday night) to appeal for public mercy for his disgraced
predecessor.
   In a nationally televised speech Wednesday, Chun apologized for
corruption and abuse of power under his authoritarian government. He
said he was surrendering all of his personal property, worth $24
million, and going into exile in the country _ a traditional path
for disgraced former leaders.
   Chun has denied any personal corrutpion, but some of his
relatives and associates have been convicted of or charged with
embezzlement and other offenses.
   Dissident groups have said Chun's apology is not enough, and they
are demanding that he be prosecuted. The country's main opposition
parties have demanded further explanations from Chun.
   The protesters in Seoul were among 2,000 students who earlier
rallied at the city's Dongguk University to demand Chun's arrest.
After the rally, about half of them stormed out of the school to
clash with police in streets and alleyways.
   Several thousand riot police in green combat fatigues and
black-visored helmets ringed the campus to stop students from
leaving. Police fired volleys of choking tear gas and hurled rocks
and other missiles.
   No arrests or injuries were reported.
   Protesters also burned an effigy of Roh and chanted: ``Punish Roh
Tae-woo!''
   Some Buddhist monks also joined in the protest and shouted:
``Drive Chun from our sacred temple!'' Chun has taken refuge in a
remote Buddhist monastery on the east coast.
   In another protest Friday in the central city of Taejon, about
250 student radicals marched through downtown streets demanding
Chun's arrest. No clashes took place.
   Roh is trying to defuse public anger against Chun without
damaging himself or his government, which many see as a continuation
of the Chun government.
   On Thursday, Roh came a step closer to pardoning Chun, telling a
group of ruling party officials that ``enough has been done.
   ``As a long friend, I felt deep sorrow for the former president,
who had to leave in such a way,'' Roh was quoted as saying. ``Any
legal action against him is not only undesirable but also against
the repeated promise by all opposition leaders objecting to
political reprisals.''
   In his TV speech Saturday, Roh also was expected to promise
democratic reforms and announce specific measures to compensate for
the offenses of the Chun era.
   Officials said the measures would include the reinstatement of
thousands of illegally purged government officials and financial
compensation for victims of the brutal military suppression of a
1980 civil uprising. According to official count, the military
killed some 200 people in the uprising in the southern city of
Kwangju.

   Two helicopters and two ships rushed to assist a
Spanish trawler that sprang a leak off Britain today, but the 15 men
aboard the striken vessel managed to stop the flooding themselves,
officials said.
   The Punta Purras Tarri sent a mayday call this morning that its
engine room was flooding and it was in danger of sinking 250 miles
southwest of England.
   Two Royal Navy Sea King helicopters from the Royal Naval Air
Station Cludrose on the Lizard, in southwest England, were sent to
the rescue along with a Polish ship in the area, the British coast
guard said.
   The helicopters, operating near the outer range of their limits,
landed on the fleet support ship Argos until the trawler's skipper
declared the emergency over, said a coast guard spokesman, who by
custom was not identified.
   Another Royal Navy ship, the Avenger, was sent to the trawler's
aid with a special pump and the Polish ship was standing by until
another trawler arrived later in the day to escort the Punta Purras
Tarri back to the Spanish port of La Coruna, the spokesman said.
   The mayday call was picked up by Spanish-speaking operators at
Valentia radio station in the Irish Republic which broadcast an
all-ships alert.

   Buying your true love the gifts in the
``Twelve Days of Christmas'' will cost you more than a song but less
than last year.
   The 12th day would cost $13,785.63, down 0.6 percent, said Robert
Christian, director of economic and fixed income research at
Provident National Bank.
   If you were to buy or hire each item every day it is mentioned in
the popular carol, you'd spend a total of $67,745.74, down 1.4
percent from last year.
   ``This may be due to a decrease in the price of five gold rings,
which are down $125, or 20 percent, from a high of $750 in 1987,''
Christian said. ``People just aren't buying them in groups of five
anymore. These days, usually one will suffice.''
   Besides gold rings, the real deal this year is a partridge in a
pear tree _ $39.95, down $5 because of lower pear tree costs. Pipers
piping and drummers drumming cost more this year, and all other
gifts remained unchanged.
   Swans-a-swimming remained the big-ticket item: $7,000 per day for
seven of them, or $42,000 for the six days they're named in the song.
   This is the fourth year Christian has compiled his CPI, or
Christmas Price Index. He consults zoos, importers and the

   William Proxmire said Friday he will continue
to issue has ``Golden Fleece'' award despite his retirement from the
Senate in January.
   Proxmire, who has handed out the awards almost monthly to
ridicule government spending he found to be wasteful, has been
elected to the National Taxpayer's Union's board of directors, and
will now issue the ``Fleece'' under its auspices.
   In the past, the awards have been given for such endeavors as a
federal grant to study why prisoners want to escape from jail.
   Proxmire, 73, is a Democrat who will have served more than 31
years as a senator from Wisconsin when his term expires in January.

   A woman found guilty of trying to
kill her comatose son by cutting his throat with a razor blade got a
one-year suspended prison term, a court spokesman said Friday.
   In court earlier this month, the woman admitted that in February
she tried to cut the neck artery of her 20-year-old son, Patrick,
who has been unconscious for 16 years since he fell through ice in a
pond.
   The mother was identified only as Philippine G., 44, in line with
Dutch judicial practice.
   The court recognized that the woman, who said Patrick's suffering
had become ``intolerable,'' acted out of compassion, the spokesman
said.
   Although euthanasia is banned, an estimated 5,000 cases occur
annually, according to the Netherlands' Royal Medical Association.
   Recently, Dutch courts have meted out only token sentences to
doctors under unofficial guidelines permitting euthanasia at the
explicit request of a patient if a terminal illness causes
``unbearable suffering.'' The Dutch government is preparing to
legalize this.
   But the Dordrecht court noted the woman lacked medical training
and her son did not ask to die.

<TEXT>
   The reactor from the nation's first
commercial nuclear power plant will be barged down the Ohio and
Mississippi rivers in the spring, but officials say there's no
danger to residents along the route.
   The reactor, from the Shippingport Atomic Power Station about 35
miles northwest of Pittsburgh, has been emptied of its uranium fuel
and filled with concrete to prevent any radioactive particles from
escaping into the environment, said Dan Butler, press officer for
the U.S. Department of Energy.
   The plant, commissioned in 1957, was shut down in 1982. The
federal Department of Energy and Duquesne Light, the
Pittsburgh-based power company, operated the plant as a
demonstration project.
   The reactor will be lifted out of the ground in early December in
preparation for the trip to a federal nuclear reservation.
   Removing the 1,000-ton reactor, 45 feet high and 18 feet across,
and getting it to the river is expected to take at least several
days, Butler said. The Department of Energy wants to wait until good
weather in the spring before it begins that moving process, Butler
said.
   ``It won't be started down the river until spring,'' he said.
``Winter is not a good time to be going down the river.''
   ``It's probably the largest single shipment of nuclear waste in
the nation's history,'' David Ney, a nuclear engineer for the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, said earlier
this year.
   The reactor will be placed on a seagoing barge, on which it will
travel down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and across the Gulf of
Mexico. It will be taken through the Panama Canal for the trip up
the West Coast and the Columbia River to its final stop at the
federal government's Hanford nuclear reservation at Hanford, Wash,
he said.
   The 7,800-mile is expected to take about six weeks, Butler said.
   Communities along the way will be notified of the barge's
movements prior to its arrival in their area, he said.
   Once the reactor-carrying barge begins its journey, no stops are
planned until it arrives at Hanford, he said.

<HEAD>Bush's Press Secretary Leaving After Transition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheila Tate, George Bush's campaign
and transition press secretary, said Friday she has taken herself
out of the competition for the same job in the Bush White House.
   ``I found myself in almost a permanent bad mood, thinking about
what did I want to do,'' Tate, 47, said in a telephone interview
from transition headquarters in Washington.
   ``I talked to members of my family, and I just had a reluctance
to give up the good personal life,'' she said. ``I worked in the
White House for four years. I do not want to go back.''
   Tate succeeded Peter Teeley as Bush's campaign press secretary
six months ago, giving up a public relations executive's job with
the Washington firm of Hill & Knowlton, to do so.
   There had been rampant speculation that Tate, who served as press
secretary to first lady Nancy Reagan during President Reagan's first
term, would be named by Bush as White House press secretary.
   No woman has ever held that position.
   Asked if she felt her decision to withdraw would have the effect
of ensuring that the job go to a man, she said, ``There are plenty
of qualified women ... so I don't take it upon myself that it is
less likely.''
   Bush had said that he wants to bring more women and minorities
into high-ranking government positions. Among the names mentioned as
possibilities for the press secretary's job are Tom DeFrank of
Newsweek magazine and Teeley.
   There also has been speculation that Bush was prepared to offer a
high-profile job to Bernard Shaw, a Cable News Network anchorman who
is black.
   Tate said that her husband, William, ``was willing to have me do
whatever I wished,'' but said that she had found the campaign and
transition press secretary's work very demanding. She said her son,
Hager, is a senior in high school and that she and her husband are
building a new home in McLean, Va.
   Tate said she informed Bush of her decision on Wednesday _ the
same day that the president-elect announced the selection of retired
Air Force Gen. Brent Scowcroft as his national security adviser.
   She said that he did not try to talk her out of it. ``He asked me
my thought processes. We talked for about 10 minutes.''
   She said they reminisced about ``the wars we'd been through. He
understood my concerns and we left it at that.''
   Tate is the second key Bush aide to announce departure plans.
Craig Fuller, who had been Bush's chief of staff for the past four
years, said last week that he would be leaving once his work as
co-director of the Bush transition office is complete in January.
   ``We're both old faces, and why not get some new faces?'' Tate
said.
   She said that Bush ``will find the best people for the jobs and I
know that a lot of them will be women and a lot of them will be
minorities.''
   She said that she and Fuller, and others who may not be remaining
for the Bush administration, ``share, above all else, a desire that
George Bush succeed.''
   Tate said she believes that Bush has a good attitude about the
role of the press in American life, and predicted that he will be
regularly available to reporters.
   ``He's made no commitments on (the number of) press
conferences,'' she said. ``But all you have to do is watch how he
has conducted himself (during th transition period) to see that he
recognizes the critical role of the press.''
   ``I don't think the press is going to have any complaints about
George Bush's accessibility,'' Tate said.

   They bent the no-smoking rules a bit at
Kraft Inc. when the chief executive of the Philip Morris tobacco
company dropped in.
   New York-based Philip Morris, the nation's biggest tobacco
manufacturer, is acquiring Glenview-based Kraft for $13 billion.
Kraft's food-service headquarters are in this Chicago suburb.
   Smoking is permitted in only a few designated areas and private
offices at Kraft, but Philip Morris Chairman Hamish Maxwell _ a
pack-a-day smoker _ apparently puffed freely during his visit Nov.
17, the day of the Great American Smokeout, the Chicago Sun-Times
reported Friday.
   ``Before Hamish got here, they took down a lot of the no-smoking
signs and ashtrays started popping out all over the place,'' the
newspaper quoted a source described only as a ``well-placed smoker''
as saying.
   The newspaper said that Kraft has no intention of changing its
policy toward smoking and that a Philip Morris spokesman it did not
identify told John Richman, Kraft's chief executive, no changes will
be sought.
   New York City's strict no-smoking ordinance exempts tobacco
companies, but the Philip Morris spokesman said non-smokers can work
in separate areas if they want.

   Employees at Kennewick General Hospital
say a multimillion-dollar remodeling project has left the place
looking like an Army field hospital, so they're going to play the
part.
   Employees have had to contend with portable lights hanging down
halls and plywood walls and ceilings in some places during
construction.
   They say it reminds them of the satirical movie and television
series ``MASH,'' short for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.
   So next Friday they plan to come to work dressed as characters
from the later seasons of the TV show, set during the Korean War.
   Darlene Smolen, hospital marketing director, said administrator
Michael Frazier will play the part of Col. Sherman Potter. Ms.
Smolen said she's not sure if anyone is going to play the part of
Cpl. Maxwell Klinger, who wore dresses in an effort to get
discharged from the Army.
   The employees' cafeteria will serve food reminiscent of the chow
that disgusted the MASH characters, including creamed chipped beef
on toast, Ms. Smolen said.
   She said the simulation is a way for hospital workers to laugh at
the construction disruptions instead of getting angry.

   A small airplane crashed into a ravine in
this southwestern Colorado city, killing the four adults and one
child aboard, authorities said.
   In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, six people survived when
their aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed.
   Cortez Police Chief Roy Lane said the Cessna 210, first reported
to have come from Prescott, Ariz., originated in Las Vegas, Nev. He
said the plane touched down as late as 3:30 p.m. Thursday in
Blanding, Utah.
   Priscilla Anderson, a spokeswoman for the National Transportation
Safety Board in Washington, D.C., said the plane was en route to
Durango.
   Lane said there was no indication from the crash that the
airplane was trying to land at the Cortez airport, which is about
four miles from the crash site.
   ``It was snowing real hard and there was fog (at the time),''
Lane said. ``Nobody actually saw the crash, several people heard
it.''
   The victims were identified as pilot William Robinson, 44; and
passengers Duane Robinson, 20; Paul Robinson, 23; Gloria Robinson,
22, and Sulinda Robinson, 5. All were from Las Vegas, Nev., said
Assistant Police Chief Russell Johnson, but he didn't know their
relationship.
   The Kass family from Okemos, Mich., waited six hours to be
rescued after their Piper Cherokee ran out of fuel and crashed in a
remote area in northern Michigan Wednesday.
   ``When the engine did stall, there was a feeling of helplessness.
I didn't think it would be a survivable crash,'' said David Kass,
30. Kass, wife Karol, 28, their two children, her brother and the
plane's pilot were flying to Hancock for a holiday feast with
relatives.
   Bruised and shaken, they sent up flares, built a bonfire and
shivered around it during their six-hour wait for help.
   Fog, wooded terrain, marshland and nearly impassable logging
roads delayed rescuers for six hours, said Marquette County
Sheriff's deputies. The plane crashed about 11 miles west of
Marquette County Airport.
   The plane was en route from Lansing to Houghton, but was diverted
to Marquette because of dense fog, Sheriff's Deputy Lawrence Sanders
said.
   Kass, his wife, and their 6-year-old daughter, Kristina, were
hospitalized while the others were treated and released.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Find Stone Age `Factory' in the Outback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists on Friday reported
finding a huge Stone Age ``factory'' in the Outback where aborigines
crafted stone blades and cutting tools for barter some 2,000 years
ago.
   Scattered among weathered stone outcrops were hundreds of
thousands of remains of stone tools and implements that point to a
sophisticated aboriginal enterprise long before Europeans set foot
on the continent.
   The site at Tiboobura, 530 miles northwest of Sydney, is so large
that archaeologists believe its output may have formed the basis for
a local export industry.
   ``Almost certainly, these people operated the workshop to
exchange goods,'' said Dan Witter, archaeologist for the
government's National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales.
   He said Tiboobura is an aboriginal word, meaning pile of rocks, a
reference to granite hills in the area. The cutting tools were made
from a silica-based rock.
   Witter told The Associated Press the Stone Age toolmakers most
likely traded for a mildly hallucinogenic drug, Pituri. The
Australian newspaper, in a report on the quarry, said Pituri was
used by nomadic aborigines to counteract hunger pains during the
long treks between hunting grounds.
   The find follows the recent discovery of a fragment of human bone
in central Australia that has been dated at 60,000 years old,
pushing back the date of human occupation of Australia by 20,000
years.
   Indigenous aborigines number about 160,000, almost one percent of
Australia's 16.5 million population.
   Witter, of Cody, Wyo., said the site consisted of fragments of
stone artifacts. No stone implements were found, but the discards
indicate blades up to 12 inches long that have only been found
hundreds of miles away in northern Queensland and the Northern
Territory.
   ``Because the site is so big, it appears aboriginal toolmakers
produced implements mainly for trade and export to other areas of
Australia,'' Witter said.
   Tiboobura is a parched area bordered by three states _ New South
Wales, Queensland and South Australia.
   The remains suggest the inhabitants crafted spear heads and
knives not only to hunt wildlife such as kangaroos, lizards and
dingoes, a native Australian wild dog, but as a form of industry.
   ``It takes a great deal of skill to make these things,'' Witter
said. ``We have only really scratched the surface of the material
that is lying around. There is clearly a great deal more under the
ground and that material may prove to be even more important.''
   Stone Age tool factories exist elsewhere, but Witter said the
Tiboobura site was significant because it is the first one found
where tools were made but not used locally.
   ``There's no other site like this,'' he said.
   Paul Jennings, local ranger for the National Parks and Wildlife
Service, said the tools were designed for lightness and versatility
because nomadic aborigines had to minimise the equipment they
carried.

<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A freighter that embarked from Philadelphia more
than two years ago with a cargo of toxic waste that no country would
accept has reached Singapore.
   Now called the Pelicano, the vessel is believed to have started
its odyssey Aug. 31, 1986, with 14,000 tons of municipal and
industrial incinerator ash under the name Khian Sea, according to
published reports and shipping sources. It was renamed the Felicia
during a stop for repairs in Yugoslavia in July, these sources said.
   ``We don't want the Pelicano to come in,'' an official of the
Port of Singapore Authority said Thursday.
   ``There is no need to give reasons. We don't know its country of
registration. The vessel is anchored outside Singapore in
international waters and has been there for about three days,'' said
the official, who insisted on anonymity.
   In a radio-telephone call to the ship by The Associated Press, a
man who said he was the captain, declined to answer questions or
give his name.
   The Straits Times newspaper Thursday quoted a crew member as
saying in another phone call that the ship originally carried toxic
waste but disposed of it.
   It said the crew member confirmed the ship was previously known
as Khian Sea and Felicia.
   The Felicia was last sighted early this month off Sri Lanka where
it was denied entry, according to Lloyd's List, a shipping
newsletter. There were unconfirmed reports then that it was heading
toward the Philippines.
   The environmentalist group Greenpeace said earlier this week that
the ship dumped its cargo somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Spokeswoman
Uta Bellion said Greenpeace learned this from shipping sources.
   At least 11 countries on four continents spurned the toxic waste.
A report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the cargo
contained aluminum, arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, mercury,
nickel, zinc and dioxins.
   Other ships are involved in toxic transport, but because of the
length of its voyage the wayward freighter came to symbolize the
problem of toxic dumping, particularly in the Third World.
   Greenpeace estimates at least 11 developing countries have taken
in waste from the United States and Europe since 1986, while 38 more
were approached. The EPA said about 2.2 million tons of toxic
garbage crosses international borders each year.
   Said to have been registered in Liberia, the Bahamas and Honduras
at different times, the Khian Sea spent 18 months wandering the
Caribbean seeking an unloading port after leaving Philadelphia.
Between 2,000 and 4,500 tons of waste were left in Haiti before the
ship made an unsuccessful attempt to enter Delaware Bay, shipping
sources said.
   Senegal in West Africa next rejected the vessel before it went to
the Mediterranean and then the Indian Ocean.
   In another phone call to the ship Thursday, The Associated Press
was told by a crewman who refused to identify himself that the ship
had no cargo on board.
   Asked where the vessel was bound, he said it had ``no further
instruction from the owners, Romo Shipping of Greece.''
   The freighter was anchored five miles southwest of the Malaysian
state of Johor, near Singapore's Sultan Shoal lighthouse.
   The Port of Singapore Authority spokesman said it was being kept
under surveillance.

   Parliament on Friday elected a new
president of the federal legislative body to replace Philipp
Jenninger, who resigned after creating a furor with a blunt speech
about the country's Nazi past.
   Lawmakers voted 380-93 for Rita Suessmuth, 51, previously head of
the federal Ministry for Youth, Family, Women and Health matters, to
replace Philipp Jenninger.
   Jenninger resigned Nov. 11 under heavy criticism for his
parliamentary speech commemorating the 50th anniversary of the
Nazis' Kristallnacht pogrom against German Jews.
   Jenninger stirred up national and international outcries of rage
with his address, in which he reminded his audience that many
Germans viewed Adolf Hitler as a hero when he came to power in 1933.
Jewish leaders and other critics said Jenninger should have balanced
his comments with stronger condemnation of Nazi atrocities.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has not yet decided on Suessmuth's
replacement at the health ministry.

   The State Department condemned on Friday what
it described as the forced relocation by Khmer Rouge rebels of

   About 8,000 Cambodians were moved out of the Ta Luan camp,

been similar forced movements of additional Cambodians from other
camps more recently, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   Most of the remaining 2,000 or so refugees still at the Ta Luan
camp are aged or infirm, he said.
   ``We condemn this forced relocation of innocent civilians from
the relative safety of U.N.-assisted camps to more remote areas
subject to cross border shelling and lacking the necessary
facilities for the provision of essential services,'' Redman said.
   The United States has urged the Thai government to use its
influence to encourage more responsible, humane actions on the part
of the Khmer Rouge and it has done so, Redman added.

   The number of abortions in the United States each
year is holding steady, according to the latest figures Friday from
the Centers for Disease Control.
   The CDC said 1,328,570 legal abortions were performed in the
United States in 1985, the latest year for which statistics are
available; that's ``virtually no change'' from 1984, when 1,333,521
legal abortions were performed.
   In 1985, as in previous years, the typical woman obtaining an
abortion in the United States was young, white and single, with no
children.
   The 0.4 percent decline in 1985 is the second drop in abortions
reported by the CDC.
   Abortions rose from a reported 22,670 in 1969, when the CDC's
record-keeping began, until 1982, then dropped 3 percent in 1983.
The number rose 5 percent in 1984.
   ``Since 1980, the abortion numbers ... appear to be relatively
stable, with minor year-to-year fluctuations,'' the Atlanta-based
health agency said.
   Dr. Hani Atrash, a CDC researcher, cautioned that states are not
forced to report each abortion as they are required to do with
certain diseases, so the numbers may not be precise.
   Women under age 25 made up 61 percent of all women having
abortions in 1985, the CDC said. Sixty-seven percent were white, 81
percent were single and 57 percent had never given birth to a live
child.
   In 1972, when the CDC began tabulating detailed characteristics
of women having abortions, 65 percent were under 25, 77 percent were
white, 70 percent were single and 49 percent had never given birth
to a live child.
   The CDC cautioned that the number of states reporting such data
varies from year to year, and trends based on the information
``should be viewed with caution.''

   Want a romantic winter evening? Turn up the
lights.
   That's right, brighter.
   There's a hormonal link between light and wintertime blues that
include a seasonal loss of sexual desire, says Professor Russel J.
Reiter of the University of Texas Health Science Center.
   As the daylight hours grow shorter, so, too, does sexual desire
in nearly 5 million Americans affected by the hormonal changes,
Reiter said. But cravings for starchy foods, frequent mood swings,
depression and lethargy increase.
   Reiter said lower light levels force a tiny pine cone-shaped
pineal gland located under the brain to produce a hormone called
melatonin, which can plunge a particularly sensitive person into
depression and shut down his sexual responses.
   Similarly, the lengthening daylight of springtime has the
opposite effect on the melatonin cycle, shutting down the pineal
gland sooner and turning on sexual desire.
   Reiter said seasonal affective disorder is more common in
Northern states where winter days are much shorter than the normal
10-hour Texas days. He said women are four times more likely to be
affected than men.
   The common treatment is sitting in a brightly lit room in the
morning for up to two hours, Reiter said.
   ``The bottom line is that light is a drug that can have
significant impact,'' said Reiter. ``What I'm more interested in is
sex _ scientifically speaking, that is.''

   Ranchers who want to know if their llamas are
going to be mamas are keeping the pregnancy testing lab busy at a
California hospital.
   Queen of the Valley Hospital performs up to 600 llama pregnancy
tests a month for breeders as far away as Louisiana, Texas and
Canada, said Glenn Lee, head of outpatient laboratory services.
   The hospital, in Napa about 40 miles northeast of San Francisco,
estimates it now performs five times as many tests for llamas as it
does for humans.
   ``We're the llama pregnancy factory of the world,'' said Lee.
   Llamas, pretty-eyed, long-necked members of the camel family, are
popular as pets and pack animals. With baby llamas selling for
$10,000 or more, people who raise the creatures like to know as soon
as possible when their animals are expecting.
   The hospital began doing the tests in 1982, when a local
physician who raises llamas asked if the lab could run a test on one
of his animals. Word of the lab's services spread among breeders,
and what began as a favor soon became a business that offers llama
breeders the same-day testing and notification it gives to its human
patients.
   ``This has to be one of the more unusual outpatient services,
said Kirkwood Reid, the llama-raising doctor. ``But it's very
successful. The Queen is probably the country's No. 1 pregnancy
testing laboratory.''

<HEAD>On Birthday Marred by Tomb Bombing, Pinochet Says Will `Go Away
Quietly'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet celebrated his 73rd
birthday Friday, although the festivities were marred by the bombing
of his family tomb, and he said he will ``go away quietly'' when his
presidency ends in 1990.
   The right-wing army commander who seized power in a 1973 coup was
feted throughout the day by military and government officials as
well as civilian supporters.
   In brief remarks to reporters, Pinochet reflected on the upcoming
end to his rule and said he will step down as scheduled in March
1990.
   ``I will go away quietly,'' he said, ``as did Venancius in Rome,
a general who after combat went to the countryside to till the
soil.''
   Pinochet lost an October referendum on extending his presidency
eight more years, and is obliged to call open elections, planned for
December 1989. He is to hand power over to the winner on March 11,
1990.
   At the city's General Cemetery, about 20 blocks north of
downtown, a bomb exploded beside the Pinochet family tomb during the
morning, authorities said. No injuries were reported and no one
claimed responsibility. The blast shattered stained-glass windows,
religious icons and flower vases in the concrete-walled mausoleum,
and also damaged other nearby crypts.
   A second bomb was found at the site and deactivated by police,
security agents said.
   Pinochet's birthday ceremonies began with a serenade by a
military band and congratulatory speeches by army officers at his
residence in an eastern suburb of the capital. Dozens of civilian
supporters also were gathered outside the house, cheering and
applauding.
   At midmorning, Pinochet went to the presidential palace, where
members of his Cabinet and other aides paid him homage and a group
of children performed folk dances.
   A group of communist activists opposed to his rule tried to enter
the palace to give him a bicycle as a birthday gift, but were
blocked by guards. An argument ensued and one of the activists,
Javier Saez, was detained by police.
   During the referendum campaign, Pinochet announced a plan to
provide workers with bicycles at reduced prices. The program was
lampooned by the opposition.

   An explosion and fire Friday struck an Italian navy
frigate that recently returned from the Persian Gulf, killing one
sailor, state television said.
   A navy official said two or three sailors were injured, but
Italian TV reported four were hurt.
   The fire appeared to have broken out in the room where the dead
sailor was found aboard the Mistrale, which had returned from duty
protecting Italian shipping during the war between Iran and Iraq,
said the navy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Italian TV said the fire might have been caused by an exploding
gas container or a problem in a diesel motor aboard the ship, which
was off the port city of La Spezia in Italy's northwestern waters.
   Italy recently announced it was withdrawing its naval force in
the gulf following the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq.

   ``Both represent the courageous black and white factions,'' Haley
said in an interview from his home in Henning, about 40 miles north
of Memphis. ``At the end, in actuality, they would have been killed
if they'd been caught. But I'd gotten so attached to them, I let
them escape.''

   ``When we lose, it's like I lose. It's devastating. It ruins

   Prince Mohammed, eldest brother of
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and a warrior who played an important part
in the conquests of his father, the late King Abdel-Aziz Ibn Saud,
died Friday at the age of 80.
   The Royal Court proclaimed the death to the nation and said the
prince would be buried Saturday.
   The conquests of the prince's father led to the overthrow of
Turkish domination from the preceding century and the unification of
most of the Arabian peninsula in 1932 into what is now Saudi Arabia.
   The Al-Saud dynasty does not pass on the rule by primogeniture,
but an inner circle of the family selects kings and crown princes
whenever needed.
   In Saudi Arabia, Mohammed was dubbed the ``maker of kings''
because he declined the crown in favor of King Faisal upon the
downfall of his half-brother, King Saud, in the early 1960s.
   He also refused the throne in favor of another half-brother, King
Khaled, after the assassination of Faisal in 1975.
   Mohammed, the eldest of the surviving sons of the founder of the
Saudi monarchy, was also called Abu Al-Sharrain, or father of two
evils, because of his fiery temper. He remained the most respected
personality in the house of Al-Saud and even the kings used to refer
to him to settle domestic disputes.
   In July 1977, Mohammed ordered the execution of his granddaughter
Princess Mishael and her lover, Khalid Muhallal, a nephew of the
then-Saudi ambassador to Lebanon.
   The execution was ordered by Mohammed for adultery, as Mishael
was married to a royal cousin. She was shot and he was beheaded. The
executions caused a stir in Western Europe and the United States and
were the basis for a widely watched British TV show, ``The Death of
a Princess.''

<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro will attend the
inauguration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, returning after 33 years
to the city where he planned the Cuban revolution, officials said.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist leader who lost the July
presidential election he contends was fraud-ridden, said Salinas
invited Castro and other foreign leaders to the Thursday
inauguration to legitimize his victory.
   Castro will probably arrive in Mexico City the day of the
ceremony, according to Salinas' office.
   Castro, 61, lived in the capital from mid-1955 until he and 81
fellow rebels sailed for Cuba on Nov. 25, 1956, from Tuxpan on the
Gulf of Mexico. He has not been back to the capital since.
   During his Mexican exile, Castro set up clandestine guerrilla
training camps, raised funds, stockpiled weapons and put the
finishing touches on his plans for the revolution that overthrew
dictator Fulgencio Batista in January 1959.
   It was also during this exile that he met the Argentine
revolutionary Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, who played a key role in
Batista's overthrow. Guevara died trying to launch another
revolution in Bolivia in 1967.
   Castro has been to Mexico only once since 1956. He held two days
of talks in the Yucatan Peninsula resort of Cancun in 1979 with
then-President Jose Lopez Portillo.
   Security is expected to be tight when Castro attends the
inauguration. Secretary of State George Shultz will represent the
United States at the ceremony.
   Castro is revered by much of the Mexican left. Rumors he might
attend the inauguration sparked sharp arguments in leftist circles,
where some feel Castro should not endorse Salinas' victory in the
July 6 election.
   Both the right and the left accuse the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party of election fraud. The party, which claimed
victory with just over 50 percent of the vote, denies the charges.
Cardenas was the second-place finisher.
   Salinas' inauguration will be the first Mexican inauguration
attended by foreign heads of state, Salinas' office said. Only such
leaders of Latin America were invited.
   So far, the presidents of Nicaragua, Argentina, Brazil, Honduras,
Uruguay, and Venezuela are confirmed guests.
   Cardenas said Friday that Salinas' invitations to foreign leaders
``means that the government of Mexico is searching with a certain
desperation for foreign support because they don't have enough
internal support.''
   He was asked if he would advise Castro and other foreign leaders
from attending inauguration.
   ``It's up to them whether they want to lend support to an
illegitimate government or if they don't want to lend support to an
illegitimate government,'' he said.
   Cardenas' late father, the revered former President Lazaro
Cardenas, befriended Castro in Mexico.
   Despite Mexican wariness about Castro's vow to export his
revolution, relations between the two countries have remained
basically sound. Mexico was the only country in Latin America that
resisted U.S. pressure to break relations with Cuba in the 1960s.
   One of the rougher patches in Mexican-Cuban relations came in
1983, when police arrested two Cuban diplomats with a bomb in a busy
Mexico City bus terminal. The two were expelled.

<TEXT>
   The children in Jesse Running's photo album
are all shown lying in coffins. All died before the age of 16.
   Jesse and Russ Running began caring for terminally ill children
about 10 years ago when Mrs. Running met 7-year-old Karen, a young
girl who had suffered severe brain damage in a car accident.
   ``All I could do was cry when I first saw her,'' Mrs. Running
said.
   The family cared for Karen until she died at 15. ``I became very
bonded to that child, as though she was our own,'' Mrs. Running said.
   Since then, the Runnings have either adopted or taken as foster
children five other terminally ill children. All have died except
3-year-old Missy, who ``is still hanging in there.''
   They presently have six adopted and foster children, four of whom
have severe health problems.
   Asked why her family takes such il children, Mrs. Running said:
``It's pretty hard to explain.''
   ``You have to have words in order to make other people understand
feelings and that's hard for me to do,'' she said.
   Missy spends much of her day in a baby seat, gasping for air. A
rare blood disease has paralyzed her.
   ``Some doctors may call her a vegetable,'' Mrs. Running said.
``I've never met a vegetable. The children will respond to the
person they are bonded to, even if it isn't any more than a knowing
look in their eyes or a slight grin.
   ``You can tell when a child is happy. That lets you know that you
are that special person in their life.''
   Photos in her album show one young girl splashing in a swimming
pool and playing with the Runnings' biological children. Another
picture shows her in a coffin. She was 6.
   Mrs. Running said her husband works while she cares for her three
foster and three adopted children. They have eight biological
children but only the youngest, 15-year-old Chris, still lives at
home.
   One of the adoptees is a 10-year-old boy from South America who
swallowed a cup of lye when he was about 1. He's a normal kid in
every way, except that he breathes through a hole in his windpipe.
   Their three foster children include a 23-year-old profoundly
retarded quadriplegic woman, a 4-year-old girl who's also a
quadriplegic and who suffers from cerebral palsy, and a 2-year-old
girl who weighed little more than a pound at birth and who still
relies on oxygen to breathe.
   The Runnings get state aid for their foster children, but Mrs.
Running says it's never enough. However, she said the state does pay
for the foster children's medical care and medical equipment.
   The children have come to the Runnings through referral from
doctors and word-of-mouth. Some parents have come to them directly
and asked that they take care of dying children.
   ``It's too hard for them to be with the child emotionally,'' she
said about such parents.
   At some point, Mrs. Running said she may no longer be able to
stand the pain.
   ``After each death, I go through a lot of soul-searching and say
`I can't do this anymore.' But then you get another phone call
asking you to take care of a child who is dying and what do you say?
No? For me, it seems, it starts all over again.''

   El Nino, the warming of Pacific Ocean

   The lava from rifts in the ocean floor may bring about the
dramatic changes in sea temperature, air pressure, winds and

   El Nino, from the Spanish for ``the child'' because the event was
noticed to occur around Christmas, caused staggering economic damage
on four continents in 1982-83. It occurred again in 1985-86 on a
lesser scale.
   Herbert R. Shaw and James G. More of the Geological Survey in
Menlo Park speculated that flows erupting through rifts in the
earth's crust transfer much of their intense heat to ocean currents
flowing around the equator.
   According to the theory, the warming of the water causes a drop
in air pressure at the ocean surface that in turn weakens or even
reverses the normal east-to-west trade winds.
   The overall result is a drastic alteration of normal weather
patterns and an abrupt halt to the upwelling of cold currents that
carry rich nutrients from the sea bottom to the surface along the
coast of South America.
   Scientists have been unable to predict when the weather
disruptions will return, but they seem to occur every three to seven
years with varying degrees of impact and can last up to two years.
   The 1982-83 El Nino wiped out fisheries in Peru and Ecuador,
touched off searing drought in Australia and southern Africa and
typhoons in Tahiti and caused unusually violent rainstorms in
California and abnormally wet winters in the Southeast.
   Both the 1982-83 and 1985-86 occurrences did major harm to
fishing off the West Coast.
   The Pacific Rim is one of the most active seismic regions in the
world. Recent underwater lava flows discovered near the Hawaiian
Islands cover nearly 9,000 square miles.

   Two men have been arrested on charges of
vandalizing a 98-year-old Jewish graveyard Nov. 8, police said
Friday.
   Swastikas and anti-Jewish slurs were discovered at the B'nai
Israel Cemetery a day before the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht,
an anti-Jewish pogrom in Nazi Germany that is said to have marked
the start of the Holocaust.
   About a half-dozen tombstones were desecrated, police said.
   Police arrested Steven S. Coutcher, 18, of Woonsocket on
Wednesday, and Bertrand C. Cabana, 23, of Providence on Friday, said
Sgt. Richard Flood. They were charged with desecrating a cemetery
and released on $10,000 bail.
   Another suspect is being sought, police said.
   If convicted, they could receive up to five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.

   A team of U.S. negotiators is heading for
Moscow this weekend for another try at reaching a new long-term
grain agreement, the White House said Friday.
   The announcement by the U.S. trade representative's office said
the next negotiating sesssion is scheduled for Monday, Nov. 28. Alan
F. Holmer, deputy U.S. trade representative, will lead the
delegation.
   Reports have circulated in recent days that an agreement may soon
be reached to replace the 5-year pact that expired on Sept. 30. It
called for minimum annual purchases by the Soviet Union of U.S. corn
and wheat.
   Though the old agreement has run out, the Soviets have continued
to buy U.S. grain, including more than 5.9 million metric tons of
corn, along with some sorghum grain, soybeans and soybean meal, for
delivery in 1988-89.

   Twenty-one paratroopers have been sent to jail
for up to two weeks each for smashing cars and windows in a rampage
at a Palestinian refugee camp, the army said Friday.
   An Israeli officer was quoted as telling a military court in Gaza
City that four soldiers standing trial for the beating death of a
Palestinian from Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp were following orders.
   Soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing youngsters in two Gaza
Strip refugee camps, wounding a 14-year-old in Nuseirat and a
16-year-old in Bureij, Arab hospital officials reported. They said
both suffered head wounds and the older boy was in serious
condition. A 14-year-old Arab was wounded in the Deir el-Balah camp,
hospital officials said.
   In the West Bank, three Arabs were wounded, two in the city of
Nablus and one in the Tulkarm refugee camp, hospital officials said.
   At least 315 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000
wounded since an uprising against Israeli occupation began in the
West Bank and Gaza on Dec. 8, 1987. Eleven Israelis have been slain.
   The paratroopers sentenced to jail attacked the Kalandia refugee
camp north of Jerusalem after their bus was stoned Sunday night. At
least four cars and 20 houses were damaged.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, army chief of staff, said there was no
excuse for the rampage. He noted that the paratroopers had attended
an officer-training course and thus belonged to the military elite.
   ``The incident had nothing to do with a misunderstanding of
orders,'' Shomron said on Israel radio. ``The army insists that
orders be carried out exactly.''
   Standing orders allow soldiers to use force in catching rioters,
but prohibit them from beating people or damaging property once a
protest has been dispersed and rioters are in custody.
   An army spokesman said the paratroopers were given jail sentences
Thursday of one to two weeks and three sergeants received two-week
sentences, with a further two weeks suspended. The squadron leader
was given a two-week sentence Tuesday.
   Legislators from both left and right criticized the decision.
   Yuval Neeman of the right-wing Tehiya Party said the soldiers
should be pardoned and Israel should consider itself at war with
Palestinian activists.
   Ran Cohen of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement said
politicians who block peace initiatives should be blamed, not
soldiers facing an impossible situation in the occupied lands. Cohen
is a paratroop reserve officer.
   The military trial of the four soldiers involves the death of
Hani el Shemi, 43, on Aug. 22 in Jabaliya.
   A report by the newspaper Hadashot quoted Lt. Rafil Tawil as
telling the court: ``The order to beat Arab rioters came straight
from the commander of the Gaza Strip, Brig. Gen. Zvi Poleg, and the
soldiers were carrying out the spirit of the order.''
   Haim Teferberg, a soldier and witness, said El Shemi was taken to
the military base in Jabaliya, accoring to a report in the newspaper
Haaretz.
   ``He was hunched over as he walked and blood was dropping from
his mouth,'' it quoted Teferberg as saying. ``I saw him up close.
They put him into the camp. His breathing was heavy. He kept saying,
`I want to die.'''
   ``When they put him on the floor I saw a soldier ... run quickly
toward him and kick him, as though in a karate move. After that he
no longer had a pulse.
   ``This is customary. Many soldiers beat up prisoners,'' he was
quoted as telling the court.

<DATELINE>PLANT CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yule trees are sprouting among the palms
in central Florida, where Christmas tree farms are a growing
business.
   The 9-year-old Florida Christmas Tree Growers Association has
grown from 23 to nearly 300 members in eight years, said Roger Webb,
associate professor in the University of Florida forestry department.
   Still, 750,000 Christmas trees are brought into the state from up
North, while only about 50,000 trees are grown and sold in Florida,
mostly in state's midsection, a fertile belt with bountiful
citrus-producing groves.
   ``We still play second-fiddle to the northern Christmas tree
industry. We still have lots of room to grow in Florida,'' Webb,
head of the Live Oak Reserve Center for research in Christmas trees,
said recently.
   Most of the farms _ which average five to seven acres _ are in
small towns near metropolitan areas.
   ``If you're going to have a Florida Christmas, you're going to
have to buy a Florida Christmas tree,'' said Fred Lloyd, who has
been growing Christmas trees for four years in Plant City, about 20
miles east of Tampa better known for its winter strawberry harvest.
   Lloyd and other farmers experiment with growing trees like the
Virginia pine in Florida. But there's also the scrappy native
Florida sand pine, the lush, aromatic red cedar and the Leyland
cypress.
   For $20 to $30, customers at Lloyd's farm can cut their own
8-foot red cedar and take it home.
   Like the Lloyds, many tree farmers are longtime farmers who added
Christmas trees to help shore up incomes. Others are retirees or
businessmen who grow trees in their spare time.
   Webb says growing trees requires diligence, hard work and usually
a minimum of four years before a farmer sees any return on his
investment.
   ``Out of 100 (interested) people, we might get five that end up
in Christmas tree production,'' he said. ``Nobody gets rich quick.
But people in the business _ once they have really gotten into the
business _ sell everything they have.''
   Large, well-established farms gross as much as $37,000 in the
three-week season beginning with the weekend after Thanksgiving,
Webb said.
   With regular trimming, the trees generally assume the conical
shape of the traditional tinsel bearers.
   But particularly in a state where the industry is in its infancy,
there are some that fall victim to the tree-trimmer in training.
   ``Last year, some of my trees looked like telephone poles,''
Lloyd said.

<HEAD>Sharansky Criticizes Israeli Intolerance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky on
Friday lashed out at what he called intolerance among Israelis of
differing beliefs, saying such attitudes endangered the nation's
existence.
   Sharansky, who arrived in Israel in 1986 after being imprisoned
for nine years in the Soviet Union, singled out the mistrust between
religious and secular Jews which escalated after four religious
parties won unprecedented political power in the Nov. 1 elections.
   ``It seems that we need a cataclysmic war to concede the
communality of our destiny,'' Sharansky wrote in an article
published in the English-language daily Jerusalem Post.
   To illustrate the point, he recalled that when he first arrived
in Israel, people speculated that his wife, Avital, would force him
to wear the skullcap worn by observant Jews. Mrs. Sharansky is
observant, while he is not.
   ``The gossip lost its humor for me when I began to realize that
it contained disbelief in our ability to live happily together
despite our different customs,'' wrote Sharansky, who during his
long imprisonment became a symbol for the struggle of Soviet Jewry.
   Sharansky said a stranger recently congratulated him for not
wearing a skullcap.
   ``I felt even my own bald pate was being conscripted into service
in a `kulturkampf' (cultural struggle). My `supporter' was not
interested in my soul-searching. He was only interested in knowing
if I was on his side or theirs,'' he wrote.
   Sharansky, 40, also cited the practice by Soviet authorities of
placing prisoners of radically different backgrounds in the same
cell to break their spirits.
   ``Our only recourse was to ... be as tolerant as possible of each
other and unite against the common enemy,'' Sharansky wrote.
   He said such unity was rare in Israel.
   ``We are so inured to self-hatred, so accustomed to our own
anti-Semitism, that when it raises its monstrous head, it hardly
raises a ripple,'' Sharansky wrote.
   He also expressed disillusionment with Israel's political system
after participating in free elections for the first time in his life.
   The election gave the right-wing Likud bloc 40 seats and the
rival Labor Party 39, with the rest going to small rightist, leftist
and religious parties. The result has been a flurry of political
bargaining as Likud tries to form a coalition government.
   Sharansky said all parties had shown their readiness to sell out
in exchange for a place in the new government.
   ``Principles were being auctioned off with dizzying dispatch. It
was not a pretty sight,'' wrote Sharansky, who despite overtures
from many political leaders has not joined a party.
   Sharansky suggested that electoral reform might alleviate some of
those problems, but added that ``ultimately, it will be our ...
ability to see ourselves in every face around us ... which will
truly bring us to the promised land.''

<HEAD>Town Meeting Urged To Ban Plastic Food Containers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in this college town are considering
a crackdown on polystyrene coffee cups and other food containers
made of long-lasting plastic foams.
   The proposal is expected to come before the 350-year-old
institution of the Town Meeting on Monday in the community of 35,000
people.
   The aim of the ban is to discourage the use of plastics because
they are not easily biodegradable, take up considerable space in the
town dump, and release gases that deplete the Earth's ozone layer
when they are manufactured and burned, according to sponsor Cynthia
Pauley.
   But a spokeswoman for the Polystyrene Packaging Council, a trade
group in Washington D.C., disputed those claims, saying researchers
have found that fast-food packaging takes up only one-quarter of 1
percent of landfills by weight and volume.
   Spokeswoman Betsy DeCampos said the polystyrene industry
voluntarily agreed to stop using chlorofluoromethane in the
manufacture of plastic cups by January out of concern for the ozone
layer.
   And DeCampos contended that plastic is not the only material that
takes a long time to decompose. ``There are newspapers that are 50
years old that are still intact and readable,'' she said.
   Several communities from Oregon to Florida are considering bans
on polystyrene cups. Bans already are in effect in Berkeley, Calif.,
and Suffolk County, N.Y., on Long Island. This summer, Massachusetts
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis issued an executive order banning state
agencies from purchasing plastic foam food packaging; the ban goes
into effect in July, Pauley said.
   However, Pauley said backers of the Amherst law would be
satisfied with a six-month study of the problem, a measure that the
selectmen are expected to propose.
   Board members would not go as far as to support a total ban on
foam and plastic products at the town landfill.
   At the town's three colleges and universities, food service
officials said they began moving away from plastic and toward paper
products six months ago. But Ashoke Gangule, executive director of
auxiliary services at the University of Massachusetts, and Janice
King, director of Amherst College's food services, said that with
plastics falling into disfavor, distributors of paper products have
raised prices.
   This community has never been reticent about commenting on global
concerns.
   Amherst has voted to oppose every war since the hostilities of
1812. It suggested banning the nuclear bomb during the Cold War days
of the 1950s.
   It has voted to impeach President Nixon, to pronounce the B-1
bomber an economic disaster, to declare the town a nuclear-free zone
and to ban investment of town funds in companies doing business in
South Africa or companies that make nuclear weapons.
   Among the other articles on this year's warrant is a proposal to
ask the Air Force to remove C-5A cargo planes from Westover Air
Force Base in Chicopee because of the noise the huge jets make
flying over Amherst.

<HEAD>Afghan Accord Mediator Removed From Political Settlement Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.N. diplomat who mediated the Afghan
accords will no longer try to arrange a political settlement in
Afghanistan because the Moslem guerrillas refuse to talk to him, a
U.N. official said Friday.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani noted this year's U.N.
resolution on Afghanistan asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to promote formation of a broad-based government, a task
envoy Diego Cordovez was striving toward.
   The secretary-general is handling that duty, and Cordovez will be
limited to supervising the 50-man team of U.N. military observers
monitoring the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and checking
violations of the accords.
   The United Nations is trying to help establish a government of
national reconciliation in order to protect Afghan communist
officials after all the more than 100,000 Soviet troops are
withdrawn in February.
   Cordovez had been promoting a government in which President Najib
would step down in favor of a coalition led by the deposed Afghan
king and former officials in exile.
   The plan saw no role for the Islamic insurgents, who call
themselves the mujahedeen, or holy warriors.
   Earlier this month mujahedeen leaders announced they would not
deal with Cordovez, and they have vowed to fight on and oust Najib
and his government, whom they call ``traitors'' and ``Russian
agents.''
   Najib has refused to dissolve his government to make way for a
coalition, but has offered to incorporate opposition members into
his administration.
   Perez de Cuellar is expected to wait and see how upcoming
discussions between the mujahedeen and Soviets on the repartriation
of prisoners of war turn out before offering any new proposals, said
officials.
   Cordovez, a former U.N. undersecretary-general who resigned
several months ago to become Ecuador's foreign minister, mediated
the Afghan accords that were signed April 14 in Geneva.
   The accords call for Afghanistan and Pakistan not to interefere
in each others' internal affairs, and for the Soviet troops to be
out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15. Half the Red Army pulled out by Aug.
15.
   The Soviet Foreign has announced a suspension of further
withdrawals due to attacks by the mujahedeen and alleged Pakistani
violations of the accord, but has said it hopes to complete the
pullout on schedule.
   On Monday, U.N. officials announced a reorganization of senior
diplomatic and peacekeeping duties at the world body, under which
Perez de Cuellar assumed personal responsibility for all major
diplomatic activity.

<HEAD>Town Revives Century-Old Intellectual Tradition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Carpenters, farmers and a Pulitzer
Prize-winning poet have revived the century-old dinner forum that
once brought to this little town 115 miles from Boston such
intellectuals as Booker T. Washington.
   Some 150 residents came to Town Hall last weekend to eat pumpkin
pie and baked chicken and listen to former U.S. Poet Laureate
Richard Wilbur read a poem dedicated to the fire chief.
   It was the first such forum since Charles Eliot Norton, founder
of The Nation magazine, and other distinguished visitors dined with
local residents and held forth on such subjects as democracy and
education every August from 1879 to 1903.
   ``We are fortunate and grateful for the kind of history we've
had,'' organizer Susan Todd said. ``Education is a valued thing in
our community and we don't have to fight for that. We don't have to
fight to let new people in town have a role in our society. Our past
made that possible. That's why we did this dinner.''
   The original Ashfield dinners were held by summer residents
Norton and George William Curtis, an author and editor of Harper's
Weekly. They were attended by the likes of poet James Russell Lowell
and novelist William Dean Howells.
   ``For a few days each year it was the cultural center of
America,'' said Donald Robinson, professor of government at Smith
College.
   The dinner conversations were spirited, he said. When the United
States entered the Spanish-American War, Norton and other speakers
denounced what they considered U.S. imperialism in the Philippines,
Robinson said.
   When Norton retired and the dinners stopped, the Boston Herald
eulogized the gatherings as ``occasions of national importance.''
   Mrs. Todd, a third-grade teacher, began organizing Sunday's
revival dinner six years ago. Town Hall's steeple was mended by
volunteers, and townspeople donated their Sunday-best china and
silver.
   Teen-agers and college students cooked and served the meal to
local carpenters, electricians, farmers, selectmen and many others
sitting on benches used at the original dinners and refurbished for
the occasion.
   The price of the dinner was kept at a low $5 to encourage
townspeople to attend, and the cost was underwritten by a $500 gift
from a photographer.
   Wilbur, who lives in nearby Cummington, dedicated ``A
Fire-Truck'' to the Ashfield fire chief, who bent the rules to allow
candles on the tables.
   Mrs. Todd said she hopes to make the dinner a yearly event for
everyone in the western Massachusetts town of 1,500 and surrounding
communities, not just such local literary lights as Wilbur, novelist
Noah Gordon and her husband, Richard Todd, a Houghton Mifflin editor
and editorial director of New England Monthly magazine.
   ``It was very democratic,'' she said of the original dinners.
``Everybody came.''

<HEAD>Tribune Accepts Strike Settlement with Printers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Tribune said Friday it has agreed to a
settlement involving cash buyouts and lifetime annuities for union
members who walked out three years ago over work rules in the
newspaper's composing room.
   The Tribune accepted the settlement, worked out under the
guidance of former U.S. Labor Secretary W.J. Usery, on Thursday,
four days after Chicago Typographical Union members approved it in a
180-43 vote.
   The settlement, backed by an $8.56 million fund, was sent for
review to Morton Bahr, president of the Washington-based
Communications Workers of America, the parent body of the printers'
local, a newspaper spokesman said.
   When the strike began 40 months ago, 240 printers walked off the
job in a dispute over company moves to gain greater control over
hiring and assignments in the composing room.
   Under the agreement, 119 printers who have remained on strike
will have the option of a buyout or a lifetime annuity, as well as
company-paid medical insurance. Fifty printers who remained at the
newspaper since a 1986 unconditional offer to return can stay, or
can each accept a $30,000 cash buyout.
   The printers agreed to drop a lawsuit in federal court that
claimed the company violated a 1975 agreement in which members were
guaranteed lifetime employment in exchange for the introduction of
labor-saving technologies.
   The agreement does not affect sympathy strikes by mailers and
pressmen whose unions remain involved in lawsuits and proceedings
before the National Labor Relations Board.

<TEXT>
   Nine countries signed a treaty
Friday governing mining in Antarctica, a pact the U.S. ambassador
called a ``landmark agreement.''
   Protesters gathered outside Parliament, voicing objections to the
pact on the world's last relatively unexplored frontier. Antarctica
is thought to contain large mineral deposits.
   Environmental organizations including the group Greenpeace want
the continent turned into a world park, suggesting a fight for
mineral resources could ignite a major military conflict.
   The countries that signed the treaty were Brazil, Finland, South
Korea, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Uruguay and
New Zealand, said an official for Foreign Minister Russell Marshall.
   Chile, the United States, Argentina and Britain made a commitment
to sign in the near future, the official said. The spokesman
declined to be identified, as is customary.
   The Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource
Activities was adopted by Antarctic Treaty countries in June after
six years of negotiations.
   U.S. ambassador to New Zealand, Paul Cleveland, said the pact was
a ``landmark agreement in the fields of resource management and
environmental protection.''
   The agreement ``reinforces the overall objectives of the
Antarctic Treaty which ensured that the southernmost region of our
planet is free of conflict or military activity of any kind.''
   Cleveland said the agreement did not prejudge whether mineral
resource activities would or should take place. He said it set out
the process by which such activities would be considered and how
decisions would be made.
   Rigorous environmental requirements had to be satisfied before
any Antarctic mineral resource activity could be authorized or
carried out, he added.

   Battles between rival Shiite Moslem
militias burst out of the southern slums Friday, filling
neighborhoods that had been quiet for two years with the thunder of
cannon and rocket fire.
   In south Lebanon, Israeli warplanes blasted bases used by
Palestinian guerrillas and allied Lebanese militiamen, killing five
guerrillas and wounding 15 other people. It was the 23rd Israeli air
raid in Lebanon this year.
   Fighting in Beirut pitted the mainstream Shiite militia Amal
(Hope) against the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God. Police
said at least 10 people were killed and 20 wounded, most of them
civilians, since it began Thursday evening.
   It was the first time the Amal-Hezbollah struggle for domination
of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites reached the residential neighborhoods
and once-glamorous hotel district of central Beirut. Previous
battles in the area during Lebanon's 13 years of civil war have
involved other rival militias.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for factions
holding most of the 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon, nine of whom
are Americans. Police said it was not known whether the fighting
with tanks, mortars and rockets had affected the hostages, who are
thought to be in the southern slums.
   ``We have vague information that the majority of the foreign
hostages are there but we don't know where exactly they are being
held,'' said a police spokesman, whose name was withheld in keeping
with regulations.
   Commanders of Syrian army units in charge of security in Moslem
west and south Beirut ordered a cease-fire Friday night.
   ``Fighting ebbed in the city but clashes persisted in the slums
after the latest truce was called,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Both sides are massing fighters and fortifying their
positions,'' he said.
   Amal fighters gained some territory, advancing behind tanks, the
spokesman said.
   Stray shells hit several apartment buildings in the south Beirut
slums, setting them afire and forcing residents into basements and
bomb shelters. Shell explosions and machine gun fire reverberated
across the city.
   Umm Mohammed, of the Haret Hreik slum district, said she was
preparing dinner when the fighting began.
   ``My daughter, three grandchildren and I rushed to the basement
for cover,'' she said. ``We didn't have dinner.
   ``There was a short lull around midnight. When I tried to fetch
some food from the apartment I saw Amal tanks rumbling across the
narrow alley and the Hezbollahis started shooting at them. I rushed
back to the basement.''
   Beirut's hotel district had been free of battle since 7,500
Syrian soldiers moved into west Beirut in February 1987 to stop a
war among other Moslem militias. Syria has more than 30,000 troops
in Lebanon, most of them in the east and north, and has become the
main power broker in the faction-ridden country.
   The confrontation betwen Amal and Hezbollah spread into west
Beirut early Friday when a rocket-propelled grenade hit the
apartment of Ayoub Homayed, a ranking Amal leader. It exploded in a
bedroom but the family was in the kitchen and no one was hurt.
   Each side accused the other of provoking the battle, the first
between them since Syrian troops intervened to stop protracted
fighting last May. It followed closely on an unsuccessful attempt
Monday to assassinate four Hezbollah leaders.
   In Sidon, the ancient port 25 miles south of Beirut, four Israeli
jet fighters fired eight rockets into guerrilla bases on the city's
eastern fringe, a police spokesman reported. He said the Israelis
made two attacks, five minutes apart, about 2 p.m.
   He said the rockets demolished a single-story building,
camouflaged in an olive grove, that served as a base for the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine led by George Habash and the
Popular Nasserite Organization, a Lebanese militia that is
predominantly Sunni Moslem.
   An adjacent one-story building used by the Sunni militia was
damaged, the police reported.
   They said those killed were three Popular Nasserite militiamen
and two guerrillas from the Habash group. Nine of the 15 wounded
were civilians, including three children, the police said.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military said its warplanes destroyed
an ammunition depot north of Sidon and returned safely.
   The raid came three days after Israeli jets and helicopter
gunships attacked a guerrilla checkpoint at the Ein el-Hilweh
refugee camp outside Sidon, killing six people and wounding nine.
   By police count, 119 people have been killed and 333 wounded in
the 23 air raids this year.

   The guerrilla-backed African National
Congress on Friday told South African church leaders its policy is
not to attack civilian targets in their homeland.
   ANC President Oliver Tambo, exiled head of the main black
nationalist movement fighting the white-led Pretoria government,
acknowledged some guerrillas hit at civilians because they were
``inspired by anger at the regime's campaign of terror.''
   But he told a news conference, ``agents of the Pretoria regime
have been known to carry out attacks to sow confusion.''
   President P.W. Botha's government blames the ANC for the more
than 150 bombings since it declared a state of emergency June 12,
1986. Most casualties are black civilians.
   Tambo spoke to reporters after a daylong meeting with South
African church leaders headed by Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
the Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   The joint news conference ended a five-day conference in Harare
of World Council of Churches clerics and civil rights activists on
Pretoria's destabilization of neighboring black-ruled states.
   Tutu said, ``It is quite important for us to keep underlining to
the world, especially to white members of our society, that the ANC
is made up of people who care enormously about our country and that
they are not ogres as they are painted to be _ that they are not
bloodthirsty.''
   Tutu said he was satisfied after the talks that the ANC was
pledged to non-violence against civilians. At previous meetings with
the ANC, Tutu has tried in vain to persuade guerrilla leaders to
abandon all violence.
   Tambo told reporters, ``it is contrary to ANC policy to attack
targets whose sole objective is civilian casualties.''
   The Harare meeting came as Pretoria announced that ANC leader
Nelson Mandela would not be returned to prison once he is released
from a private clinic treating him for tuberculosis. South African
officials said they will keep Mandela under guard at an unspecified
location.
   Mandela, 70, has been serving a life sentence since his 1964
conviction with other ANC leaders for sabotage and plotting to
topple the government.
   Tambo, his one-time law associate and president-in-exile of the
ANC, said Mandela always would be the head of the movement.

   When Joseph Sexton and Beth-Anne Thye
were married, they promised to love, honor and respect each other.
But the respect part of the vow, which they agreed to seal by
sharing surnames, has not been easy to fulfill.
   The University of Florida law students are challenging the state
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles for not allowing him
to combine his surname with hers on his driver's license.
   ``Basically what my wife could do for free I would have to go out
and hire an attorney to do,'' he said, ``and that's what struck me
as wrong with the whole system.''
   A 1952 Florida Supreme Court decision allows a name change only
with a court order, which he estimated would cost $200.
   But officials stand behind the policy that allows women to change
their names when they marry, but requires men to have court orders.
   ``You must admit that it is a custom of the American way of
life,'' said Glenn Blocker, assistant director of the division of
driver's licenses. ``It's been with us for eons, centuries.''
   A second couple has challenged the policy as sex discrimination.
   Michael and Susie Boydston-White of Tallahassee sued Nov. 15 in
Leon County circuit court, claiming the policy is unconstitutional
because it allows women a courtesy not provided to men.
   The Thye Sextons, who initiated their challenge in July, have a
hearing Tuesday before the Division of Administrative Hearings.
   Before their Aug. 8, 1987, marriage, Sexton and Thye decided to
take each other's surname out of respect. When they returned to
Gainesville from their wedding, the couple went about getting legal
papers changed to their new name.
   Sexton said he had no trouble changing his Social Security card,
voter-registration card, bank identification, real-estate license
and school records.

   A former police commander sentenced to
four years in jail for allowing the alleged killer of a U.S. drug
enforcement agent to flee has been released after 36 months, a news
agency reported.
   Armando Pavon Reyes left a Guadalajara prison Thursday,
accompanied by his brothers, according to the Excelsior News Agency.
   Pavon Reyes was federal judicial police commander in Guadalajara,
322 miles west of Mexico City, when Drug Enforcement Administration
agent Enrique Camarena Salazar was abducted by gunmen within sight
of the U.S. Consulate there Feb. 7, 1985.
   He was convicted of taking a $300,000 bribe so reputed drug
kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero could escape aboard a private jet
despite U.S. officials' pleas for his detention.
   DEA agents at the airport said Caro Quintero gave Pavon Reyes a
farewell embrace while surrounded by a score of bodyguards. It was
the last seen of Caro Quintero until he was arrested April 4, 1985,
in Costa Rica.
   Pavon Reyes was fired shortly after reports surfaced about the
airport incident. When he surrendered to authorities, he said he was
innocent of the charge and claimed he did not even know Caro
Quintero.
   Camarena's badly beaten body was found March 5 buried in a
plastic bag on a ranch 60 miles southeast of Guadalajara, along with
the body of a Mexican pilot working with him who had been kidnapped
the same day elsewhere in Guadalajara.
   Pavon Reyes was among nearly 40 people arrested in the case in
April 1985.
   Caro Quintero was sentenced in September to 34 years in prison on
other charges in Mexico City. The sentence was handed down the same
day a U.S. federal jury in Los Angeles found former Mexican
policeman Raul Lopez Alvarez guilty of killing Camarena. Lopez had
been a state judicial policeman on the homicide squad in Guadalajara.

   The government won't neglect political
reforms despite the heavily economic background of new premier
Miklos Nemeth and economic reform theorist Reszo Nyers, officials
said Friday.
   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz, who relinquished his
additional post as premier Thursday in favor of the 40-year-old
Nemeth, said the new team would be better able to manage the reform
program of austerity combined with economic and political change.
   Nyers, 65, was appointed to the newly created post of minister of
state for economics.
   He and minister of state Imre Pozsgay are two of the most adamant
proponents of reform in Hungary's communist leadership. Pozsgay
reported to parliament Thursday on planned political reforms,
indicating he will take charge of this area.
   At a news conference Friday, he denied political reforms have
taken a back seat to necessary economic changes.
   He said the draft of a new constitution which may allow for a
multiparty system, could be ready in six months. But it cannot be
adopted until 1990 to allow for broad social debate, he said.
   In an interview with the government daily newspaper Magyar
Hirlap, Nemeth said recent lessening of tension between the
superpowers created ``favorable conditions'' for Hungary's reforms.
   ``This is a rare, fortunate moment in history when both our
allies ... and the other side ... are taking an interest in the
success of the Hungarian reform policy,'' Nemeth told the daily.
   ``In this changing Europe we live in, we have to emerge as a
country which promotes the overcoming of the continent's divide
without any local tensions,'' he said.
   Under Grosz, Hungary's leadership has been grappling with
unpopular reforms to revive the stagnating economy and curb a $17
billion debt.
   Nemeth, like Grosz, would like to see the development of what the
leadership calls a ``socialist market economy.''
   Nyers, considered the pioneer of economic reforms in the 1960s,
was returned to the country's top leadership last May after being
ousted from the ruling Politburo in 1974.
   Grosz told Western and Hungarian journalists in an impromptu
interview Friday that he supports both men wholeheartedly.
   He described Nemeth, who spent a year at Harvard University in
the mid-1970s, as ``a gifted young man and outstanding economist.''
   Asked why the second post was created and why Nyers lost his bid
challenging Nemeth for the premiership, Grosz said the two would
complement each other in a way impossible in the reverse
constellation.
   ``You cannot imagine the amount of drudgery the premier faces
around the clock,'' Grosz said. ``There is little time to deal with
theory.''
   He described Nyers as a ``farsighted'' scholar, who for 20 years
has dealt with theory rather than day-to-day work.
   Grosz, 56, said he hoped Nemeth would bring in ``young people
capable of taking on burdens,'' preferably those in their 30s.

   Friends and relatives sobbed
uncontrollably Friday at the funeral of Christina Onassis in the
cathedral her father, Aristotle, helped to build.
   A cross of pink roses in the name of her 3-year-old daughter,
Athena, adorned the casket. The young girl did not attend the
45-minute Greek Orthodox liturgy for the shipping heiress, who died
Nov. 19 in Buenos Aires at age 37.
   Fifteen priests and bishops officiated at St. Fotini cathedral,
which was packed with about 500 friends and relatives.
   Athena, the child of Ms. Onassis and former husband Thierry
Roussel, was said to be staying with relatives somewhere in
Switzerland, unaware of her mother's death. The body arrived on a
chartered airliner Thursday via Switzerland.
   An Argentine coroner said in a preliminary report that Ms.
Onassis died of a pulmonary edema, or buildup of fluid in the lungs
at the home of her friends Alberto and Marina de Doderos.
   Argentine authorities have not dismissed the possibility of a
drug overdose because pills, which have not been identified, were
found in her bedroom.
   Roussel, who was Ms. Onassis' fourth husband, stood alone behind
the flower- covered casket flanked by her close friends and
relatives. They were married in March 1984 but she began divorce
proceedings eight months later.
   Priests with gray beards and golden robes chanted ``Eternal Be
Your Memory'' as they circled the closed mahogany casket trimmed
with silver. An all-male choir accompanied the chanting priests from
behind screens.
   Shipowners, government ministers and former business associates
of her father were present in the crowded cathedral.
   About 3,000 mourners stood outside in a light rain. Hundreds of
people lined balconies of nearby apartment houses.
   ``Life to you!'' the crowd shouted as white-gloved pallbears
carried the casket from the cathedral behind the cross of pink roses
and a large wreath of chrysanthemums and roses from both Roussel and
Athena.
   All the pallbearers were recipients of scholarships for graduate
study abroad from the Alexander Onassis Public Benefit Foundation,
of which Ms. Onassis was president.
   Her father established the foundation, based in Liechtenstein,
after her brother, Alexander, was killed in an air crash at the
Athens airport in 1973. Half of the $1 billion legacy Aristotle
Onassis left went to the foundation and Ms. Onassis inherited the
rest.
   Ioannis Georgakis, a business adviser to the Onassis family, said
the body was flown to an airport on Greece's northwest coast after
the service and taken by launch to Skorpios, an Ionian Sea island
Aristotle Onassis bought in 1963.
   He said the burial service on the island Saturday would be
attended only by relatives and close friends. Ms. Onassis is to
buried beside her father, who died in 1975, and her brother in the
family mausoleum adjacent to a tiny chapel in the center of Skorpios.
   The chapel was the site of her father's wedding in 1968 to
Jacqueline Kennedy.

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush said
Friday he would turn his attention quickly to the problem of cutting
the U.S. deficit, but he brushed aside questions on reports he may
attempt to trim $3.5 billion to $5 billion from Medicare.
   ``I keep reading in the papers a lot of things I'm supposed to be
doing that I don't know anything about,'' Bush told reporters during
a shopping trip while on a four-day Thanksgiving vacation at his
family's oceanside retreat.
   Bush indicated he has made no decisions yet on budget cuts.
``Don't make judgments based on stories that don't really have any
authority behind them,'' Bush said.
   A spokesman, Stephen Hart, said suggestions on Medicare cuts were
``completely speculative.''
   ``It's premature for anyone to speculate about the budget,'' Hart
said.
   Bush worked for several hours in a small cabin which serves as
his office in the family compound, but told reporters he had ``no
appointments'' during the holiday.
   Bush spoke with reporters briefly as he and wife Barbara made
their morning shopping round, including a stop at a wine and cheese
shop named the ``Tipsy Mouse,'' where he picked up goodies to serve
reporters at a reception later in the day at their house.
   The vice president also visited a video store, where he rented
the movie ``Broadcast News,'' and dropped by a hardware store and a
golf equipment shop at a local country club.
   Meanwhile, sources close to the vice president, who spoke only on
the condition of anonymity, said the selection of a new defense
secretary remained up in the air. Key advisers remained deeply
divided on the prospect of filling the post with former Senate Armed
Services Chairman John Tower of Texas, the sources said.
   Bush himself has given few clues, but in recent days has appeared
to discourage suggestions that it would be Tower. In any event, Bush
said he has not yet made up his mind.
   Bush declined to comment further on recent news reports,
including one in Friday's editions in Washington Post, that his
administration would go along with billions of dollars' worth of
Medicare cuts expected to be proposed in President Reagan's final
budget submission to Congress in January.
   Asked whether he advocated any cuts in Medicare funding, Bush
said only that ``My view is I'll address the whole budget problem
very soon.''
   Bush vowed earlier this week to appoint negotiators on the first
day of his presidency to meet with members of Congress on budget
cuts. Richard Darman, his choice as budget director, suggested the
strategy, whereby Bush would refrain from submitting his own rewrite
of the Reagan budget, but instead would work behind the scenes with
Congress to forge a compromise.
   But Darman also has said that Medicare is an area where Bush will
look for savings. Without changes, the giant health insurance
program for the elderly is projected to cost the government $97.7
billion in fiscal 1990, which starts next October, an increase of
14.5 percent over the current year. That rate of growth is four
times the expected rate of overall inflation.
   Bush has insisted he will not support any form of tax increase
and would seek to reduce the nation's $150 billion budget deficit
with a ``flexible freeze'' on spending. Such as freeze would hold
overall spending at the level of inflation, with expenditures in new
areas offset by cutbacks in others.
   The Bushes were to have dinner Friday night at their home with
Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston.
   Toward evening Bush jogged on a dirt road near his home, wearing
an ``Oak Ridge Boys'' sweatshirt.
   ```Hanna' has been replaced by the Oak Ridge Boys,'' Bush
playfully shouted at reporters. The day before, Bush had worn a
sweatshirt bearing only the word ``Hanna,'' and aides said they had
no idea what it meant. Later, the mystery was partially resolved
with their explanation that it had come from a high school somewhere
in Pennsylvania.

   A federal appeals court Friday overturned
the mail fraud conviction of a former state assemblyman accused of
accepting payments and favors from a fireworks manufacturer pressing
for favorable legislation.
   Bruce Young in 1987 became the first California legislator
convicted of political corruption in more than 30 years.
   In overturning the conviction, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals cited a 1987 Supreme Court ruling that said mail fraud
covered only property crimes, not the violation of ``the intangible
right of the citizenry to good government.''
   Young, a 42-year-old Democrat from Cerritos who served in the
Assembly from 1977 to 1984, was indicted nearly two years after
leaving office in an FBI investigation into efforts by W. Patrick
Moriarty to influence lawmakers to allow the sale of ``safe and
sane'' fireworks.
   Young was convicted of accepting payments and favors, such as use
of a vehicle, and of laundering $18,500 in campaign contributions
from Moriarty to other candidates for office.
   He was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $5,000 fine but
remained free on bail and served no time.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year in a case from Kentucky
that the right to good government cannot be the basis for a mail
fraud conviction.
   Federal prosecutors nevertheless urged the appeals court to
uphold Young's conviction, arguing that he had defrauded the public
of his salary, office expenses and consulting fees gained solely
because of his office.
   The ruling does not prevent the government from seeking another
trial on a theory of property fraud.
   Moriarty was released from prison Nov. 3 after three of five mail
fraud convictions were overturned. He had admitted laundering
campaign funds, paying kickbacks and promising hidden business
interests to public officials.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for a fund created in the wake of
the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor accident contends the
Department of Energy is blocking researchers from crucial data on
the accident's long-term health effects.
   The Three Mile Island Public Health Fund, which supports health
research, filed a petition this week with U.S. District Judge Sylvia
Rambo asking that the department be ordered to turn over health
records it and previous federal agencies have collected since the
beginning of the nuclear age.
   Considered the world's most extensive compilation of
atomic-related health data, the records cover 300,000 people who
have worked since 1943 at federal nuclear weapons and energy
research and production laboratories.
   ``The department has acted in bad faith and has no present
intention of releasing he data,'' the fund's attorney, Daniel
Berger, said in his brief filed Wednesday.
   ``The data ... holds the promise of producing more precise and
authoritative estimates of cancer risks of low-level radiation
exposure than was previously available,'' the brief said.
   The TMI Public Health Fund was created in 1981 by a settlement in
a class-action suit Berger's father, David, had filed against
subsidiaries and contractors of General Public Utilities Corp.,
owner of TMI.
   The Unit 2 reactor at the plant was severely damaged in a March
1979 accident when a series of operator errors and equipment
malfunctions allowed a loss of cooling water, which led to the
melting of some of the uranium fuel and the release of some
radiaoctive particles and gas.
   The settlement created a $20 million fund to pay damages and the
$5 million health fund to back research. Berger's firm manages the
health fund under the supervision of Ms. Rambo.
   Berger said researchers supported by the fund, Alice Stewart and
George Kneale of Birmingham University in England, cannot move ahead
with a $1.4 million, four- to six-year study without the DOE's
complete, computerized records.
   The study's goal is to examine cancer risk from low-level
radiation among federal nuclear energy workers and use that to help
better understand the effects of the March 1979 TMI accident.
   The New York Times has reported that the department was prepared
last month to reject the fund's May 1987 Freedom of Information
Request for the data, but reconsidered when the Times asked about
it. The Times reported Thursday that the department was still
rethinking its 24-year-old policy against releasing the raw health
data.
   Department spokesman Jeff Sherwood said Friday that standard
policy is not to comment on matters pending before the courts.
Normal court procedure gives the department 15 days to file a
response.
   In its petition, the fund contends the department verbally agreed
in January to release the data with some restrictions, but a short
time later said it would turn over only those records used by
department researchers for previously published studies.
   Ms. Stewart and Kneale argue that it would be meaningless to work
with data screened by somebody else and that they need to see the
complete records themselves. Both have worked on previous DOE
radiation health studies, according to the brief.
   The fund also said the department deliberately tried to put the
records further out of reach. The department has said the fund would
need clearance from 21 states and U.S. territories that were
promised the death and health records they submitted would not be
released to outside researchers. It initially said clearance from
all 50 states was needed.
   After the fund filed the Freedom of Information request, the
brief contends, the department tried to establish formal agreements
with more states ensuring the death data from the states could not
be released.

   The Red Cross said Friday it is hopeful a 10-day
air shuttle can repatriate more than 1,500 disabled Iraqi and
Iranian prisoners as planned, although the exchange started with
fewer prisoners than expected.
   On Thursday, the first day of the exchange, each side sent back
fewer than half the number of prisoners envisaged under an accord
they signed earlier this month with the International Committee of
the Red Cross.
   Red Cross officials said they were working with both sides to
resolve the problems in the first major exchange of prisoners since
a cease-fire Aug. 20 ended fighting in the 8-year-old war between
the Persian Gulf neighbors.
   The International Committee spoke of a ``setback,'' but spokesman
Juerg Bischof said it is hopeful the goal of returning all sick or
wounded prisoners by the end of the year can be achieved.
   He said Red Cross delegates in Baghdad and Tehran were in touch
with the responsible officials and other contacts were made through
diplomatic channels in an effort to reconcile ``differences of
interpretation.''
   Bischof said plans to continue the exchange Saturday remained in
effect, and ``we hope that this time the numbers of returnees will
be as planned.''
   Under the accord, 115 Iraqis and 41 Iranians are to be
repatriated daily in air shuttles between the capitals, except on
Friday, the Moslem holiday.
   On Thursday, only 52 Iraqis and 19 Iranians were flown home
aboard a DC-9 jet chartered by the Red Cross.
   Iran said 36 of those chosen for the first flight sought or
already had been granted political asylum, and 27 had recovered from
illness and no longer met the criteria for repatriation.
   Iraq accused Iran of reneging on the accord and responded by
reducing the number of Iranians sent home.
   Bischof would not comment on the Iraqi charges.
   He said the accord was based on a list of 1,569 disabled POWS the
Red Cross compiled some years ago.
   ``This old list was the only concrete basis,'' he said. ``At
least it was something to work with, as no other sick and wounded
prisoners have been registered yet by the ICRC. Only if the whole
list has been covered will we be able to say how many no longer met
the criteria for repatriation.''
   All prisoners are examined by a three-member commission _ two
Swiss Red Cross physicians and a local doctor. Subsequently, each
prisoner is asked by a Red Cross delegate, without witnesses, to
make sure he agrees to repatriation.
   Under the accord, both sides agree that Red Cross registration of
all other disabled prisoners can begin Dec. 5.
   ``We have no reason to assume that this date will be changed,''
Bischof said.
   More than 100,000 prisoners of war are believed held by both
sides.
   In Iran, meanwhile, Speaker of Parliament Hashemi Rafsanjani
vowed that Iran would never start a war and warned that his country
must be wary of new attacks by Iraq, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Friday.
   Rafsanjani, in remarks to a gathering of paramilitary troops in
Tehran on Thursday, said Iraq's commitment to peace was
questionable, the agency reported.

   Only about 20 percent of people at high risk of
complications from the flu are immunized against the disease each
year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said in its weekly report
Friday.
   However, state and local flu vaccine programs are increasing, and
some reach hundreds of thousands of people at risk for flu
complications, federal health researchers said.
   The CDC recommends flu vaccine especially for elderly Americans,
heart patients, people with chronic health problems and others at
increased risk of severe _ and possibly even fatal _ complications
from influenza.
   CDC spokesman Don Berreth said the major complication of
influenza is pneumonia, but it also can exacerbate any existing
condition such as heart disease, diabetes or kidney disease.
   ``Health-care providers should make every effort to ensure that
high-risk persons are immunized during routine health-care contacts
during the fall and early winter,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   Flu season in the United States traditionally occurs during cold
weather months.
   The CDC noted three programs that have achieved success in
distributing flu vaccine to at-risk people: an Allegheny County,
Pa., Health Department program which vaccinated 84 percent of the
county's nursing home population in the 1986-87 flu season; a
California program which distributed some 350,000 doses of flu
vaccine to elderly residents in the 1986-87 season; and a Vermont
program by which the state receives a Blue Cross-Blue Shield grant
for flu vaccinations.

   Archaeologists searching Fort McHenry for
underground drainage conduits have stumbled upon a long trench
presumably used by infantrymen the night the British attacked
Baltimore in 1814.
   The bombardment of Fort McHenry inspired Francis Scott Key to
write the poem ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' later adopted as the
national anthem.
   The trench, originally about three feet deep, is about seven feet
below today's surface level and is more than 100 feet long. It
contained a pewter infantryman's button the size of a nickel and a
10-pound fragment of a British cannon ball.
   ``At first, the trench was very puzzling. ... But it was the
(infantryman's) button and bomb fragment which linked it with the
War of 1812. The button was of the type worn then, during the late
18th and early 19th centuries,'' said Charles D. Cheek, the
archaeologist in charge of the dig.
   The trench was dug around the fort's western flank, the side
farthest from the harbor and the British fleet. Historians believe
the 600 infantrymen stationed at Fort McHenry could have been
ordered into the trench as a safety measure.
   If the British had landed successfully in the attack on the night
of Sept. 13, 1814, the infantrymen would have been called upon to
defend the city.
   However, the British bombardment of the fort killed only four and
wounded about two dozen. The British were unable to get ashore and
retreated.
   The existence of some sort of old trench was known as early as
1984, when a section was discovered during an earlier dig. The
archaeologists doing the work then were unsure what the depression
was, Cheek said.
   Cheek and six other archaeologists arrived at the fort five weeks
ago under a $105,000 contract from the National Park Service to find
the fort's original drainage conduits. They failed to find all the
drains.
   Park Ranger Paul E. Plamann said the archaeologists were called
in to see if there was an existing drainage system that could be
repaired and reopened because the fort has been troubled with
deterioration of its brickwork for many years.

<TEXT>
   The nation's largest organization of Orthodox
Jews on Friday condemned interference by ``some North American
Jewish circles'' in an immigration law question it said Israelis
alone should settle.
   The resolution adopted at the 90th anniversary convention of the
Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America didn't identify
any particular group as interfering with Israeli sovereignty.
   In New York, leaders of 21 organizations associated with
Judaism's Reform and Conservative branches were announcing they will
fly to Jerusalem on Sunday to plead against a proposal by Orthodox
leaders in Israel that would deny automatic citizenship to
non-Orthodox converts.
   ``The question of who is a Jew should be decided by the Jewish
people, and not by a political body,'' the delegation said in a
statement.
   The Orthodox convention, which claims more than a million members
in some 1,200 U.S. synagogues, said in its resolution: ``It has
become increasingly fashionable in some North American Jewish
circles to publicly interfere in the most delicate questions of
Israeli foreign policy, domestic security and religious integrity.
   ``We call upon all North American Jews to desist forthwith from
public campaigns that only lead to diminishing Israel's stature in
the eyes of the general public while further dividing and polarizing
North American Jewry.''
   The issue arose in the wake of the recent Israeli election in
which neither major party achieved a parliamentary majority.
   Parties of the religious Orthodox, which have the swing votes to
form a government, demand a change in the Law of Return as the price
of joining a coalition that would be led by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir. The law grants Israeli citizenship automatically to all Jews.
   The group visiting Israel to oppose any change in the law will be
headed by Ruth Popkin, past president of Hadassah, and Rabbi Daniel
Syme of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, from the Reform
branch of Judaism, said Richard Cohen, speaking for the delegation.
   In a related action, the UAHC's leader, Rabbi Alexander
Schindler, urged Reform synagogues throughout the United States and
Canada to fight the proposed change but not allow the controversy to
``turn us away from Israel.''

   Rock legend Chuck Berry, accused of punching a
woman in the mouth, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and paid a
$250 fine, officials said Friday.
   Berry, 62, of St. Louis, had been charged with misdemeanor
assault. Marilyn O. Boteler accused him of hitting her at a hotel in
1987, loosening several of her teeth and causing a cut that required
five stitches.
   The nature of the dispute was not disclosed.
   Berry pleaded guilty Tuesday to harassment. He could have
received up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted on the
assault charge.
   Ms. Boteler has filed a multimillion-dollar suit against the
singer, composer and guitarist, whose hits include ``Johnny B.
Goode'' and ``Roll Over Beethoven.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police detained more than 20 people Friday
during rallies in the southwestern city of Wroclaw protesting high
school military training and political prisoners, opposition
spokesmen said.
   An opposition group told delegates to an international conference
of parliamentarians in Warsaw that restriction of human rights in
Soviet-bloc nations hinders creation of ``a common Europe.''
   Solidarity activist Jozef Pinior said police in Wroclaw used
clubs to break up a demonstration of about 1,500 people, most of
them young, organized by the Interschool Resistance Committee
against military training in high schools.
   Officers charged as the young people marched to the office of the
district school administrator to deliver a petition, Pinior said,
and about 20 people were detained.
   Earlier, Wroclaw police took three people into custody after a
rally by a Polish-Czechoslovak Solidarity group about political
prisoners in Czechoslovakia, Pinior's wife Maria said.
   About 800 people marched to the center of the city, some carrying
a huge banner reading ``Stalinism will not win in Czechoslovakia,''
she said, and leaders of the march distributed leaflets with the
names of 22 political prisoners in Czechoslovakia.
   Polish-Czechoslovak Solidarity seeks to develop links between the
Polish and Czechoslovak opposition movements. Activists from both
countries have held several clandestine meetings along the
mountainous frontier between the two Soviet-bloc countries.
   The conference of about 150 legislators from 33 countries in
Europe, the United States and Canada runs from Saturday through
Monday by invitation of Roman Malinowsky, speaker of the Polish
parliament.
   Among those scheduled to attend is U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos, a
Democrat from California.
   Topics to be addressed include ``Parliaments and Democracy'' and
``Cooperation in the Name of Europe's Future.'' Organizers say it is
the first conference of legislators from the Eastern bloc and the
West.
   An open letter to partipants from the group Freedom and Peace
released Friday said, ``The fight for respect of human rights is
closely connected with the striving for a united Europe.''
   It questioned whether the Western delegates should meet with East
bloc parliamentarians, declaring: ``An equal cooperation of
parliaments resulting from free elections with those which are a
result of appointment confirms the undemocratic political system.''
   ``Only live contacts'' among peoples can create ``the living
tissue of a common Europe,'' the letter said. ``Today such contacts
are made difficult by the authorities of East European countries, by
limiting possibilities of expressing one's views, limiting
information, violating the secret of correspondence, limitation of
freedom of travel, etc.''
   Copies of the letter were given to Western news agencies in
Warsaw.

   Tens of thousands of people packed Baku's central
square Friday, facing Red Army tanks sent by the Kremlin to quell
ethnic rioting and panic in the southern republics of Azerbaijan and
Armenia.
   A spokesman for the Azerbaijan government said by telephone from
Baku that soldiers had cordoned off Armenian districts in the city
of 1.7 million people.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, president and Communist Party chief, said
Soviet leaders would meet soon with delegations of Armenians and
Azerbaijanis seeking a ``solution that would conform to the best
interests of these two peoples and our country.''
   Gorbachev made the comment in a joint interview with visiting
President Francois Mitterrand of France broadcast Friday night on
the French television network Antenne-2.
   Scenes of milling masses and military armor in both Baku, a city
in Azerbaijan, and Yerevan, capital of neighboring Armenia, were
shown on the Soviet evening television news.
   An announcer said, ``The passions and emotions accumulated in the
hearts of Baku residents spill out in the square,'' and another in
Yerevan added: ``Contradictory rumors are being floated which
aggravate the atmosphere.''
   More than 2,000 ethnic Armenians have fled Azerbaijan to Armenia,
panicked by violence that killed three people and injured at least
126. Reports of far higher tolls are rife in the Armenian community
but cannot be confirmed.
   Ethnic conflict in the two Caucasus republics began last February
because of a dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a territory with a
predominantly Armenian population that has been part of Azerbaijan
since 1923.
   Armenians held general strikes and mass demonstrations demanding
that the territory be annexed to Armenia, although they do not have
a common border, but Moscow did not approve it.
   A riot Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait killed 32
people, 26 of them Armenians.
   Armenian legislators issued another challenge to Gorbachev's
policies Friday, at an impromptu meeting that rejected his proposed
constitutional reform and again demanded annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Musa Mamedov, chief of information for the Azerbaijan Foreign
Ministry, said Baku remained tense and industries in the Caspian Sea
port were closed by strikes. Soviet television confirmed the strikes.
   He said Interior Ministry soldiers had cordoned off Armenian
districts.
   In a report Thursday, Mamedov said people were killed in
Kirovabad, but on Friday he called that ``unofficial information''
and said he had nothing official about Thursday's events in
Kirovabad.
   Izvestia, the Soviet government newspaper, said pressmen in Baku
refused to print local copies of national papers Friday ``because
they are reporting nothing about events in Azerbaijan.'' Izvestia
said it had to ship 134,000 copies from Moscow.
   Its only other coverage of the unrest in the south was a brief
report on curfews in several places and an appeal for calm from
local writers.
   The newspaper Baku Rabochii carried a report Wednesday that
speakers in the city's main square claimed Izvestia's coverage was
``one-sided, fully ignoring the question of Azerbaijani workers who
are living in Armenia.''
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
Thursday in Moscow that tanks and troops had been sent to
re-establish order in Baku and in Kirovabad and Nakhichevan, the
cities where rioting began Tuesday.
   Ruben Karagosyan, chief editor of Armenia's official news agency
Armenpress, said by telephone from Yerevan that a curfew was imposed
there Thursday night.
   ``Soldiers are patrolling the streets and army helicopters are
flying over the city,'' he said.
   Karagosyan said 2,200 ethnic Armenians who fled Azerbaijan had
been registered by an Armenian government commission created to help
them. The republic allocated $2.8 million in aid, he said.
   Armenia's legislature ended its regular fall session Tuesday
after a Kremlin envoy, Arkady Volsky, said the situation in the
Caucasus had become too hot to proceed. The lamwakers had intended
to debate the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
   About 200 deputies resumed the session Thursday night, meeting
until 2 a.m. in the Opera Theater in Yerevan, said Victoria
Manukyan, chief of local news for Armenpress.
   She did not say what decisions were reached but Rafael Popoyan,
an Armenian activist, said the deputies again demanded unification
of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia and rejected the constitutional
changes proposed by Gorbachev.
   Those amendments have provoked strong criticism, especially among
activists in the independent-minded Baltic republics, who say they
would increase the central government's power at the expense of the
15 Soviet republics.
   The amendments, to be considered at a special session of the
national parliament next week, also strengthen the powers of the
presidency, now held by Gorbachev, and create a new full-time
legislature.
   Legislators in Estonia, Latvia and Georgia have demanded changes
in the texts proposed by Gorbachev and Estonia rejected the
amendments outright.

   The head of Italy's state-run railways resigned
Friday during a corruption scandal that prompted a criminal
investigation into the purchase of disposable sheets for sleeping
berths in trains.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said all 14 other board directors of
the system also submitted their resignations.
   Rail chief Ludovico Ligato, who has denied wrongdoing, cited the
criminal investigation as one reason he decided to resign.
   A judicial investigation centers on a $120 million, five-year
contract for supplying disposable sheets. Domestic media dubbed it
the ``Golden Sheets Scandal.''
   Transportation Minister Giorgio Santuz accepted Ligato's
resignation and said he will nominate a special administrator to run
the railroads until a permanent replacement is appointed.
   Eleven people from both the railroads and private industry have
been charged with fraud and corruption in the case.
   Ligato has not been charged but recently received an official
notice from the Rome prosecutor's office he was under investigation
for possible fraud.
   Ligato, 59, was named president of the rail system in 1985. He is
a former member of parliament with the Christian Democrats, Italy's
largest party.
   The case involves a contract awarded in May 1987 to a company
owned by Elio Graziano, who was charged last year with improperly
obtaining funds under a program to rebuild earthquake-damaged areas
near Naples. Graziano was also charged in this case, but authorities
cannot find him.
   Their investigation began after a rival firm complained that all
competing companies were notified too late to submit bids.
   Newspapers say authorities are trying to determine if bribes were
paid for the contract and if other companies were bought off not to
enter bids.

   A storm over the southern Plains, snow in the northern midsection
and a downpour in southern California added up to an inclement
Friday for much of the nation west of the Mississippi.
   Showers and thunderstorms occurred in Arkansas and parts of
eastern and northern Texas.
   To the north of the low pressure area associated with that storm,
snow fell in western Kansas and Nebraska and in eastern Colorado. An
inch of snow fell at Pueblo, Colo., in the six hour period ending at
1 p.m. EST.
   Winter storm watches were posted for Friday night and Saturday in
eastern South Dakota, extreme southeastern North Dakota and parts of
western and north- central Minnesota.
   Up to 8 inches of snow was expected to pile up by late Friday in
the Arizona mountains. Snow overnight also was forecast in the
mountains and higher elevations of Utah, and light snow fell in
parts of the Pacific Northwest and the Intermountain region west of
the central Rockies.
   Rain soaked parts of southern California and turned to snow in
higher elevations.
   San Diego had nearly three-quarters of an inch of rain in the six
hours up to 1 p.m. EST, flooding streets.
   Wind speeds exceeded 50 mph in the Tehachapi Valley in southern
California. In West Texas, wind gusts were clocked at up to 69 mph
at the Guadalupe Pass on Friday morning, with prospects for gusts up
to 80 mph.
   Temperatures early Friday afternoon were in the teens and 20s in
parts of the northern and central Rockies. Central and eastern
Texas, southern parts of the lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf
Coast region and much of Florida had 70s, with 80s in southernmost
Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees at Jackson, Wyo., to 87 degrees at McAllen, Texas. The
nation's low Friday morning was 11 degrees below zero at Jackson,
Wyo.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
across much of the Mississippi Valley, the upper Great Lakes, the
Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley and the central Gulf Coast. Snow
was predicted for northeast Nebraska, South Dakota, western
Minnesota, the northern and central Rockies and higher elevations of
the central and southern Plateau. Rain was forecast along the
Pacific Northwest coast.
   High temperatures were expected to be 20s in North Dakota and the
northern Rockies, 30s and 40s from the northern Pacific Coast across
the northern and central Intermountain region, the central Rockies,
the central Plains and South Dakota into the upper Mississippi
Valley, with 40s in northern Maine. Highs were forecast to be in the
70s and 80s from south-central and eastern Texas across the Gulf
Coast states and Florida to eastern parts of the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast. The desert Southwest should have 70s, and most of
the remainder of the nation 50s and 60s.

   A 61-year-old psychiatric patient died
Friday and a second person was in intensive care after a
Thanksgiving-style turkey dinner that left nearly 100 people ill
with food poisoning, officials said.
   A total of 26 people were hospitalized after the meal Wednesday
at four outpatient centers operated by the state-run Rockland
Psychiatric Center, said Nancy McPartlin, Westchester County Health
Department spokeswoman.
   The food was prepared by Flik International, a catering service
in Mamaroneck, at a cafeteria at Iona College, she said. Ms.
McPartlin said more than two dozen Iona students ate the leftovers
and went home for the holiday.
   ``We want students who may suffer any symptoms to go immediately
to a doctor or an emergency room and to notify us,'' said Ms.
McPartlin. She said officials also were looking for food handlers
who may have snacked on the meal.
   Ms. McPartlin said those stricken included an unidentified
61-year-old woman who died at Mount Vernon Hospital after suffering
a heart attack and symptoms of food poisoning, including vomiting
and diarrhea.
   Another victim was in intensive care, she said.
   The Health Department closed the Iona kitchen, and the source of
the food poisoning was under investigation, Ms. McPartlin said.
   ``We will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and
we are investigating every aspect,'' said Ruediger Flik, head of the
catering company.
   The out-patient centers were in Mount Vernon, Yonkers, Tuckahoe
and Nyack, said Ms. McPartlin.

   Police said Friday they arrested 116
refugees from the Dominican Republic who made the dangerous 90-mile
crossing of the Mona Passage in flimsy boats.
   They said 84 men and 32 women were in the group.
   Thousands of Dominicans enter Puerto Rico illegally each year by
crossing the strip of water that separates their impoverished
Caribbean island from the wealthier U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
   Authorities said 109 of the refugees were caught Friday and seven
had been apprehended Thursday. Police in helicopters patrolled the
shoreline between Aguadilla, on the western tip of the island, and
nearby Rincon in search of others who may have fled.
   Police said the arrested refugees, aged 15 to 42, were given to
immigration officials for deportation. Authorities said it was the
largest group of illegal Dominicans ever caught in Puerto Rico in
one day.
   The Dominicans pay organizers $500-$3,000 each for a trip on a
``yola,'' the name given the frail boats of aluminum or wood.
   In August, the Dominican navy said one organizer of a trip to
Puerto Rico threw two men overboard, drowning one, when the boat was
detected. In late July, at least seven people drowned and 11
disappeared after their boat capsized.
   Inflation as high as 60 percent and rising unemployment drive an
increasing number of Dominicans to risk the trip in hopes of jobs
and better living conditions in Puerto Rico.
   Because Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens with U.S. passports,
entry to the United States is easier for Dominicans from there.
   Hundreds of Dominicans apply daily for U.S. visas at the U.S.
consulate in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo. Embassy officials
say they believe about 1 million Dominicans live in the United
States and more than half may be illegal residents.

<HEAD>Three Central Committee Members Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three top officials resigned Friday
from Yugoslavia's policy-making Communist Party Central Committee,
the state news agency Tanjug reported.
   It said the resignations by Vice President Stane Dolanc, Deputy
Premier Janez Zemljaric and federal trade union chief Marjan Orozen
were in line with recent policy that bans officials from holding
state and party jobs simultaneously.
   The policy was adopted at a Central Committee session last month
that focused on Yugoslavia's political and economic crises.
   The three officials announced their resignations at a party
meeting in their native republic of Slovenia.
   National party chief Stipe Suvar said at least a third of the 165
federal Central Committee members who now hold both state and party
jobs will have to resign.
   Dolanc was a vice president in the nine-member collective state
presidency and a close aide to the late Josip Broz Tito, who founded
communist Yugoslavia and led it outside the Soviet bloc. Dolanc's
senior posts have included such influential jobs as Communist Party
secretary and interior minister.
   Yugoslavia, a loose federation of six republics and two
autonomous provinces, has been rent by ethnic strife.
   The nation also has struggled with a 236 percent annual inflation
rate, a 15 percent unemployment rate and a $21 billion foreign debt.
It now looks geared to launch a market economy system next year in
efforts to cope with its economic problems.
   A popular Serbian magazine, Intervju, on Friday denounced Suvar,
as ``an impassioned dogmatic with a Stalinist profile.''
   The magazine, known for its all-out backing of Serbian leader
Slobodan Milosevic, accused Suvar of failing to lend support to the
Serbian leadership.
   Suvar is a Croat by nationality and was rotated to the top of the
collective party presidium in the annual changeover last summer.
   The republic of Serbia, under Milosevic, seeks greater control
over its southern province of Kosovo. The reason reportedly is to
protect the Slav minority there from alleged persecution by ethnic
Albanians and also to pursue the ambitious Serbian leader's plans
for more centralist power.
   Serbia's action has run into opposition in the northern republics
of Croatia and Slovenia.
   Serbia forced the dismissal of two top Kosovo leaders a week ago,
but the move sent up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians to the streets in
protest last weekend.
   Scores of rallies in Serbia and in Montenegro have lent support
in recent months to Milosevic's hard-line policies, with frequent
denunciation of leaders from the nation's other republics or the two
autonomous provinces within Serbia, Kosovo and Vojvodina.

   A Libyan official told Italian authorities Friday his
country adheres to international rules that prohibit the use of
chemical weapons but not their production, the Foreign Ministry said.
   The United States has said Libya is on the verge of producing
chemical weapons.
   Maj. Abdulsalam Jalloud, considered No. 2 man to Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi, was asked about poison gas production during a
meeting in Rome with Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, a ministry
statement said.
   Jalloud said Libya adheres to the 1925 Geneva convention, which
bans the use of chemical weapons but not their production and
storage.
   In September, the U.S. State Department said it had evidence
Libya was able to make chemical weapons and was on the verge of
full-scale production.
   Libya has denied the accusation and claimed a new factory,
described in reports as a site for chemical weapons manufacture, is
a pharmaceutical plant.
   Jalloud is the highest-ranking Libyan official to visit Rome
since Libya fired a missile at the tiny Sicilian island of Lampedusa
in April 1986, hours after the U.S. bombing raid on two Libyan
coastal cities. Libya is a former Italian colony.

<TEXT>
   Letter lady Vanna White, disgraced preacher
Jimmy Swaggart, dethroned Olympian Ben Johnson, boxer Mike Tyson and
talk show melee victim Geraldo Rivera were top recipients of the 6th
annual Bozo Awards.
   Larry Harmon, television's original Bozo the clown, released his
list of the 1988's dubious achievers in 11 categories on Friday. The
honors are always announced the day after Thanksgiving.
   Miss White, of ``Wheel of Fortune'' fame, took the showbiz award
for ``exposing herself to the letter'' in a men's magazine layout,
Harmon said.
   Swaggart, the evangelist who acknowledged consorting with a
prostitute, revealed that ``old-time religion and another old-time
profession just don't mix.'' Johnson took the sports division
because his 100-meter gold medal at the Seoul Olympics was yanked
because of a positive test for steroids.
   Tyson's well publicized marriage problems won him the newsmaker
Bozo, and Rivera, whose nose was broken by a thrown chair during a
brawl on the set of ``Geraldo,'' took the journalism honor ``for
showing us that he has a nose for news after all,'' Harmon said.
   Other winners included:
   _Former presidential spokesman Larry Speakes, for making up
presidential quotes.
   _Actress Cher, for endorsing yet another celebrity scent.
   _State Department architects, for building the electronic
bug-infested new embassy in Moscow.
   _Hugh Hefner, for announcing his impending marriage.
   _Exerciser Richard Simmons, for lifetime achievement.
   _and Jimmy the Greek, who took the public speaking award for
``his dubious analysis of black athletes.''
   This year the actual award is a Bozo telephone, which will be
sent to each winner, said Jerry Digney, spokesman for Larry Harmon
Pictures.
   Harmon created the clown character more than three decades ago
and has trained more than 200 people to portray Bozo. The live TV
show celebrates its 30th anniversary Jan. 5.

   President-elect George Bush's eldest son,
George, and John Sununu, the designated White House chief of staff,
are among those working for free at the transition office, according
to a list released Friday.
   The transition office provided names of the 109 paid staff as
well as some volunteers. All told, 150 people are volunteering. Nine
people have been brought over from the vice president's office to
staff the headquarters.
   The transition's co-directors, Craig Fuller and Robert Teeter,
previously made public the top people in the transition office. The
new list supplements that, and says whether a person is receiving
compensation.
   Some transition staffers have already received appointments to
work in the Bush administration.
   For instance, Ed Rogers and Andrew Card, members of the paid
transition staff who were on the Bush campaign, will work for
Sununu, the retiring New Hampshire governor, in January.
   Fuller, who lost to Sununu in the jockeying to become chief of
staff, said he will return to private business after Jan. 20.
Teeter, a political consultant from Detroit, Mich., has not said
what he will do.
   But in an interview taped Friday for broadcast on CNN's vans and
Novak program on Saturday, Sununu said he had asked Teeter to serve
as deputy chief of staff.
   ``He's considering it and I would hope that he says yes,'' Sununu
said of Teeter, who served as Bush's pollster during the campaign.
   George W. Bush Jr., Bush's 42-year-old son, is serving as a
senior adviser to the transition on a volunteer basis, as is Lee
Atwater, the Bush campaign manager named as chairman of the
Republican National Committee.
   James A. Baker III, a Bush confidant in line to become the
secretary of state, is a paid senior adviser on the transition team.
So is his longtime aide, Margaret Tutwiler.
   Also on the paid staff is press secretary Sheila Tate, who
disclosed in an interview Friday she has taken herself out of the
running for that job at the White House.
   Fred Zeder, a close friend of Bush and one of his campaign
fund-raisers, is another paid senior adviser.
   Among those on the policy development staff is Doug Wead, who
served as Bush's liaison to evangelical groups during the campaign.
   Two of the seven people working in the transition for Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle are volunteers, the office said. They are
Dan Evans, an Indianapolis attorney, and Fred Fielding, a Washington
lawyer. Evans is Quayle's good friend; Fielding is the former White
House counsel in the Reagan administration.
   Congress appropriated more than $3 million for the transition
operation.

<HEAD>Mexican Runner-Up Calls Incoming Government Illegitimate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, runner-up in Mexico's
disputed presidential race, said Friday that any foreign president
who attends his opponent's inauguration would be supporting an
``illegitimate government.''
   Cardenas spoke at a news conference to introduce the book,
``X-Ray of a Fraud,'' which lists him as co-author.
   ``This book investigates how and why the official results of the
(July 6) election differed from the true vote,'' he said.
   The book says a close analysis of election returns revealed
numerical, logical and statistical inconsistencies which prove that
vote totals were altered fraudulently.
   President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, takes office on Dec. 1.
He offered on Thursday to begin a dialogue with the opposition
National Democratic Front, a coalition of leftist and centrist
parties headed by Cardenas.
   ``There can be a thousand kinds of dialogue,'' Cardenas said
Friday. ``But we will maintain our position that the first objective
must be to discuss ways of restoring legitimacy to the government.''
   He was asked if Cuba's Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega
would be giving Salinas the blessing of the international left by
attending the inauguration.
   Cardenas replied, ``We assume they, like any other president, are
coming in accordance with the purposes of their own governments.
   ``It's up to them whether they want to lend support to an
illegitimate government or if they don't want to lend support to an
illegitimate government.''
   He noted that Mexico invited foreign heads of state to the
inaugural for the first time, and said, ``For me, it means that the
government of Mexico is searching with a certain desperation for
foreign support because they don't have enough internal support.''
   In official returns, Salinas received 9,641,329 votes, or 50.36
percent, to Cardenas' 5,956,988, or 31.12 percent. Manuel Clouthier
of the rightist National Action Party got 3,267,159 votes, or 17.07
percent. Minor parties split the rest.
   ``X-Ray of a Fraud'' said a reconstruction of the ``actual vote''
gave the Democratic Front 41 percent, the PRI 36 percent and
National Action 23 per cent.
   The PRI says that while some irregularities did occur during the
election, they did not materially affect the results. It also says
opposition candidates manipulated the vote in some areas themselves.
   ``X-Ray of a Fraud'' tries to track the footprints of fraud,
opposition representatives said in a statement.
   As an example, the book notes that party vote totals in a ward
have a one-in-10 chance of ending in zero, but PRI totals in wards
where the party won by large margins ended in zero far more often.
   ``The statistical odds of that happening by accident are the same
as if you flipped a coin 191 times and they all came up heads,''
said the statement.

   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan will
participate in the next round of peace talks in Paris among warring
Cambodian factions, the guerrilla radio said Friday.
   According to the radio, Khieu Samphan sent a letter dated Nov. 17
to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian resistance leader, saying:
``I am ready to join with all parties in our CGDK (Coalition
Government of Democratic Kampuchea) in the next meeting in Paris at
any time you think suitable.''
   The three-party coalition is fighting the decade-old Vietnamese
occupation of Cambodia. A transcript of the clandestine broadcast
was obtained Friday by The Associated Press.
   In the letter, Khieu Samphan said he will ask Khmer Rouge envoy
Ok Sakun to attend meetings of a working committee established
earlier this month, the radio said. The committee, based in the
former Cambodian Embassy in Paris, is studying political solutions
for Cambodia.
   A three-way meeting of Sihanouk; Son Sann, who leads one of the
three resistance groups, and Premier Hun Sen of Cambodia did not
reach agreement on Cambodia's future at the Nov. 7-8 talks in France
but agreed to meet again early in 1989.
   Sihanouk, who governed Cambodia from 1941-1970, accused Hun Sen
of putting Vietnamese and Soviet interests ahead of Cambodian
concerns.
   The communist Khmer Rouge, the largest rebel fighting force, was
invited to the November meeting but the others rejected Ok Sakun as
its representative.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia in 1975-79 with a reign of terror
in which more than 2 million people died by execution, famine and
rioting.

<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested multimillionaire
businessman Argyris Saliarelis on Friday on charges that he helped
George Koskotas, the central figure in a major Greek banking
scandal, flee to the United States.
   A federal magistrate in Boston ordered Koskotas held without bail
Friday. FBI agents arrested the 34-year-old fugitive when he arrived
in Massachusetts late Wednesday by private Lear jet.
   Saliarelis, who deals in precious stones and shipping, was taken
into custody in Athens and accused of providing the jet. He said his
two pilots used the aircraft without his knowledge while he was on a
business trip in Africa.
   If convicted, Saliarelis could receive a 10-year prison term.
   Koskotas first fled to Brazil and then to the United States as a
scandal rocked Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist government and
forced two ministers to resign. It prompted a call Friday for new
elections.
   Opposition conservatives claimed that Koskotas was allowed to
escape so he would not implicate top government officials in illegal
financial deals. Magazines and leading newspapers accused
Papandreou's son, Education Minister George Papandreou, of being
involved.
   Koskotas was chairman of the Bank of Crete. A preliminary
government report said he siphoned off $135 million in bank money
into his own accounts and used $200 million more for unsecured loans
and gifts to soccer clubs, athletes, business associates,
journalists and friends.
   The report said Koskotas used bank funds to build up a publishing
empire, including five magazines and three national daily papers.
Later, he bought a controlling interest in an Athens soccer club.
   He was suspended as bank chairman Oct. 20 and charged with fraud
and embezzlement. Koskotas disappeared on Nov.6 while under police
surveillance.
   His lawyer said Koskotas was in Brazil with his wife, a
naturalized U.S. citizen, and their five children but decided to
leave because he believed that Greek assailants tracked him down and
planned to kill him and his family.
   Meanwhile, George Papadimitriou, a former minister of transport
and communications, demanded that the government schedule immediate
elections. He served in the government with Papandreou's Panhellenic
Socialist Movement party.
   In his statement, Papadimitriou said the ``stinking Koskotas
scandal has captivated the ordinary citizens, who ask for a cleaning
up of the situation, while the recent government reshuffle proved a
total absence of sensitivity by certain persons.''
   Papandreou made a minor reshuffle last week but kept all
ministers accused in the scandal.
   General elections are scheduled for June when the government's
four-year mandate expires. Elections can be called earlier if the
governing party chooses.
   Recent polls indicated the scandal has damaged the government's
image for failing to act quickly to investigate.

<HEAD>Peronists Repudiate Violence as Way to Achieve Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICENTE L. PANETTA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peronist Party on Friday
renounced violence as a means of achieving political change and
expelled the Montoneros, the leftist former guerrilla group, from
the party organization.
   The move appeared to be an attempt to deflect criticism by
political foes and clean up the party's image.
   ``Peronism is a force for peace and repudiates violence,'' Carlos
Menem, the party's presidential candidate and a member of its
national board, said.
   Menem leads rival Eduardo Angeloz of the governing Radical Civic
Union by a substantial margin in virtually every poll prior to next
May's national elections.
   Efforts to link Peronism with violence are ``a campaign launched
by the Radicals,'' Menem said.
   The 24-member board ruled that the Montoneros no longer may take
part in party affairs. Pablo Unamuno, leader of the Montoneros'
political wing, Revolutionary Peronism, was suspended indefinitely.
   The Montoneros were formed in the 1960s when the Peronist Party
was banned from all political activity. They staged spectacular
kidnappings and bank robberies, and waged open war with police and
soldiers.
   After becoming one of the most powerful guerrilla groups in Latin
America, the so-called ``soldiers of Peron'' were almost wiped out
by military and security forces during the late 1970s.
   The Montoneros formally disbanded following the end of the
military regime and the election of civilian President Raul Alfonsin
in 1983, and channeled their activities through the Revolutionary
Peronism movement within the Peronist Party.
   The board's decision on Friday came in a short communique after a
five-hour meeting. No explanation was given, but it followed weeks
of reports and speculation that former Montonero leader Mario
Firmenich would be pardoned if Menem becomes president.
   Menem strongly denied statements by Unamuno to that effect, or
that he, as president, would consider a general amnesty of people
convicted of crimes related to the violence and suppression of
violence in which thousands died.
   ``It's too early for any amnesty. I'm not in favor,'' Menem said
in Rome this month during a Western European tour aimed at
diminishing the ``black legend'' of Peronism as a party that
tolerates violence and authoritarianism.
   Firmenich is serving a 30-year prison sentence for his part in
the 1974 kidnapping of two Argentine businessmen, in which a $60
million ransom was paid.
   Menem is trying to broaden his party's base from workers, unions
and the disadvantaged to include the middle class.
   Peronism dates to Juan Domingo Peron, who was elected president
in 1946 and inaugurated a dictatorship that was overthrown in 1955.
Peron was restored to the presidency in September 1973 elections
after 18 years of exile, but died the following year.

<TEXT>
   Guerrilla sabotage that cut electric power and
fouled the water supply caused havoc for a fourth day Friday among
Lima residents already plagued by increased terrorism and a crippled
economy.
   ``We are in the middle of total chaos. There is a complete lack
of government,'' labor leader Flavio Rojas told reporters.
   Near Ayacucho, gunmen shot a journalist and blew up his body. In
nearby Huancavelica, guerrillas killed two high school teachers and
a parent, authorities said Friday.
   Prices of food and other goods have doubled since Tuesday, when
the center-left government of President Alan Garcia implemented
austerity measures to pull Peru from its worst recession this
century and slow annual inflation, which has soared to more than
1,200 percent.
   But the measures have not brought an end to long lines for such
basic foods as milk, sugar, rice and bread.
   Food shortages developed during the past month, adding to
scarcities in other consumer and industrial items such as drugs and
tires. The scarcities are due in great measure to a lack of dollar
reserves to pay for imports.
   The dollar shortage has been aggravated by a paralyzing,
37-day-old strike in the mineral industry, which produces more than
50 percent of Peru's export earnings.
   On Thursday, most of the capital's bank employees went on strike
for higher wages.
   ``Our country is a mess,'' said Guillermina de Canales, an
elderly woman waiting in long line at a food market. ``There are
these long lines and then the deaths from terrorism. No one can
restore order to Peru.''
   The austerity measures came hours after Mao-inspired Shining Path
guerrillas blew up strategic power pylons high in the Andes,
sparking a widepread power failure which also crippled Lima's water
purification system.
   Since early Tuesday, Lima's water has been undrinkable. The
blackout is affecting about 60 percent of this capital city of 7
million, officials said.
   Businesses have been forced to reduce or halt operations.
   Warnings by city officials to use only bottled or boiled tap
water have been difficult to comply with due to a rapid sellout in
stores of mineral water and the lack of electricty to boil water.
   Slum residents have complained that the water is causing children
to develop diarrhea.
   Lima's electrical supply has been sabotaged dozens of times since
the Shining Path launched its guerrilla war eight years ago. But the
current outage is the longest since 1983, when the city blacked out
for nearly a week.
   The rebels also have stepped up attacks since the weekend.
Officials said dozens of people have been killed in the mountains
and jungle, including at least 22 soldiers.
   Garcia, who began a five-year term in July 1985, has sought to
restore calm, saying the austerity measures will soon work to
strengthen the economy.
   Meanwhile, Hugo Bustios, 34, a correspondent for the Lima news
magazine Caretas, was killed and Eduardo Rojas, 27, a correspondent
for the Lima daily Actualidad, was wounded Thursday as they traveled
by motorcycle outside of Huanta, 30 miles north of Ayacucho, police
said.
   Officials said it was undetermined if the killing was carried out
by the Shining Path or a new anti-rebel death squad, the Rodrigo
Franco Command.
   Both groups have threatened journalists in Ayacucho, 225 miles
southeast of Lima.
   In the adjoining state of Huancavelica, Shining Path guerrillas
Friday killed two teachers and a father visiting their rural school,
police said. They said the teachers were killed for refusing to join
a regional strike called by guerrillas.
   The government says more than 12,000 people have died in the
insurgency.

   Philip S. Heisler, former managing editor of The
(Baltimore) Evening Sun who as a war correspondent once hypnotized
battle-weary Navy pilots to help them sleep, has died of cancer. He
was 73.
   Heisler, who died at his home Thursday, was an amateur hypnotist,
a horse breeder and a newsman who favored a straightforward
reporting style. He was managing editor for 30 years until his
retirement in 1979.
   He scored a major scoop toward the end of World War II when he
reported that the Marines had gained the upper hand at Iwo Jima.
Heisler observed the famous flag-raising atop Mount Suribachi from
offshore, relaying his story to the United States before his rival
on the island could return to the ship.
   An Associated Press dispatch from the Pacific in World War II
described how Heisler had hypnotized a group of pilots aboard an
aircraft carrier so they could get a good night's sleep for the
first time in weeks.
   The Evening Sun's longest-serving managing editor, he once
assigned the job of horserace handicapper to a Sun janitor who was
having more success than regular bettors, and had a reporter compare
the crime rates of Dodge City in its heyday and Baltimore of the
1960s.
   Heisler was born in Dallastown, Pa., graduated from Pennsylvania
State University in 1937 and joined The Evening Sun in 1939.
   After an illness in 1983, he wrote a note to the newspaper staff
thanking them for ``saving my life.''
   ``At a very low moment one night,'' he wrote, ``I decided that I
would just give up. But then I realized that this would give you the
opportunity to write my obituary. When I thought of all of the
things you could (and probably would) put in it, I decided to get
better.''
   He is survived by his wife, Helen, and a sister.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Monday.

   Alexander Dubcek, the ousted Czechoslovak
leader whose 1968 reforms were crushed by Soviet troops, left Friday
for Vienna, Austria, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   Dubcek is traveling outside his homeland for the first time in 18
years. He came to Italy on Nov. 11 to receive an honorary degree at
the University of Bologna.
   He left Bologna on Friday aboard a private chartered aircraft,
bound for Vienna, but he indicated earlier he wanted to spend his
67th birthday on Sunday with his family in Czechoslovakia, ANSA
reported.
   Dubcek feared that the government might not let him return after
granting him the travel visa, but it said he will be allowed back.
   As Communist Party leader, Dubcek tried to liberalize
Czechoslovakia's political and economic systems through the
so-called ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968. Soviet-led East bloc
troops repressed the movement that same year and Dubcek was
subsequently ousted.
   Dubcek visited Bologna, Rome, Venice and Ravenna and met with
Italian political leaders and Pope John Paul II.

   Presidents Francois Mitterrand and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev discussed on Friday how to improve relations between
France and the Soviet Union ``in line with a rapidly changing
world,'' the Foreign Ministry said.
   Mitterrand arrived Friday for a two-day visit that will include
watching the launch of a joint Soviet-French space mission,
scheduled for Saturday.
   In their first meetings, he and Gorbachev spoke of disarmament,
reduction of conventional weapons and improving economic ties,
according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov and
Hubert Vedrine, spokesman for Mitterrand.
   France has been a harsh critic of Soviet human rights policies
but Vedrine did not comment on that issue at Friday night's news
briefing.
   Officials announced in connection with the summit that French
banks led by Credit Lyonnais are extending a line of credit worth
more than $2 billion to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets also signed a joint venture agreement with the
state-owned Pechiney SA metals group to build a huge
aluminum-packaging factory in Armenia.
   Officials said 75 percent of the financing will come from the
Soviets and 25 percent from Pechiney and a group of banks led by
Credit Lyonnais. It was not clear whether the deal was included in
the credit line.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met Mitterrand at the
airport, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The French leader met with Gorbachev in the Kremlin for two hours
and 15 minutes, and again over dinner.
   Mitterrand will visit the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central
Asia on Saturday to watch the Soviet-French crew blast off on a trip
to the Soviet space station Mir.

<HEAD>SAC Spokesman Says Too Early To Speculate on Crash Cause</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Strategic Air Command said
Friday it is too soon to tell whether ice buildup may have caused
the crash of a B-1B bomber at an Air Force base in South Dakota last
week.
   ``It's too premature to speculate on any cause'' of the crash of
the $280 million aircraft, said Maj. Dennis Pierson of SAC
headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base.
   He was responding to a report in the Chicago Tribune that quoted
an unidentified Pentagon official as saying ice buildup on the
plane, which was not equipped with wing de-icers, may have caused
the crash.
   The four crew members ejected safely when the bomber crashed Nov.
17 while approaching for a landing during bad weather at Ellsworth
Air Force Base, S.D.
   It was the second bomber to crash in less than two weeks and the
third crash of a B-1B in 14 months.
   The Tribune reported that the Pentagon source, who requested
anonymity, said an ice alert was in effect at the time of the crash,
and another bomber that landed about five minutes earlier had a
buildup of about half an inch of ice on the leading edge of its
wings.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified aeronautical engineer as
saying such a buildup could cause a plane to crash by changing the
shape of the airfoil, resulting in a loss of lift.
   Mike Mathews, a spokesman for Rockwell International, the prime
contractor for the B-1B, confirmed that the bomber, unlike civilian
aircraft of comparable size, is not equipped with wing de-icers.
   ``Our wind tunnel tests showed it did not need them for normal
cold weather operations,'' said Mathews, who contended that the ice
buildup was not significant.
   Pierson said the bomber is equipped with an ice-detection system
that would warn pilots of problems.
   A former military pilot told the Tribune that many of the
nation's other military jets are not equipped with wing de-icers. He
cited the T-38 and the A-4.
   ``They're built to just boom through the low-altitude weather and
get to the clear air at higher altitudes,'' he said.
   One function of the B-1B, however, is to fly hundreds of miles at
extremely low altitudes.

<HEAD>Screening Begins For Nearly 200 Potential Jurors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COALVILLE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers used a questionnaire Friday to
begin screening 177 potential jurors in the trial of three members
of a polygamist clan who are accused of murdering a state officer.
   State District Judge Michael Murphy told potential jurors who
assembled in a school auditorium that he wanted the case to be in
the hands of the jury by Dec. 20. He warned against contact with
news media and reporters that could influence the potential jurors.
   Addam Swapp, 27, his brother, Jonathan Swapp, 21, and John
Timothy Singer, 22, are charged with second-degree murder in the
Jan. 28 shooting death of state Corrections Lt. Fred House.
   House was directing police dogs in an attempt to capture Addam
Swapp during a 13-day standoff at the clan's farm in Marion. The
standoff was triggered by the Jan. 16 bombing of a nearby Mormon
chapel.
   During the standoff, Addam Swapp said the bombing had been
ordered by God as a sign of impending collapse of the Mormon Church
and all government. He said it would trigger the resurrection of
John Singer, the father of John Timothy Singer and of Swapp's two
wives.
   The 25-page, 276-question questionnaire asked potential jurors
whether they were active members of the Mormon Church, and whether
they, their relatives or acquaintances associate with any organized
polygamous group.
   ``I don't want a jury who may be accused of compromising their
decision because of their community or church ties,'' said Earl
Spafford, one of the defense attorneys who planned to cull the
survey for jurors who should be dismissed.
   The three defendants and Vickie Singer, 45, widow of John Singer,
were convicted in federal court on charges stemming from the bombing
and standoff.

<TEXT>
   A crack that would have been nearly
impossible to detect by normal inspection methods used on traveling
carnival rides appears to have led to the collapse of a ride in
which a teen-ager was killed, state officials say.
   An inspection of the ``Monster'' ride Thursday at the Broward
County Fair found that one of its six metal arms had collapsed at
the spot of a tiny crack that went unnoticed in previous inspections
because it was painted over, said Wally Rich, director of the
state's Bureau of Fairs and Expositions.
   Rust under the paint indicated the crack had been there for some
time, he said Friday.
   The broken section was sent for detailed study by a metallurgist
at Florida Atlantic University.
   ``This ride has been inspected in four states in the past two
months by four inspectors, and in that time, no one found that crack
_ neither the inspectors, nor the staff operating the ride,'' Rich
said.
   Wednesday's collapse at the fair killed a 17-year-old high school
senior and injured seven other fairgoers. One remained in a hospital
Friday.
   The ride was built in 1975 by Eyerly Aircraft Co., of Salem,
Ore., Rich said. He said the company went out of business ``about
three years ago,'' but that a new company formed by the owner of
Eyerly still supplies replacement parts for its rides.
   Each arm of the ride supports four baskets that hold up to three
people each and whirls them up and down.
   Rich said the ride at the Broward fair had been subjected to a
thorough inspection in Anderson, S.C., on Sept. 14. Inspection each
day at the Broward fair also showed no signs of negligence or
improper inspection, Rich said.
   Rich said his department hoped to get a final report from the
university on the cause of the accident in two weeks.
   ``We haven't found any area of negligence,'' Rich said. ``There's
nothing we can really put our finger on. We're not technical
experts.''
   Rich said his department's six inspectors would be hard put to
give frequent, exhaustive tests to the state's 1,161 licensed
carnival rides.
   ``It would be almost impossible for us to carry out a program of
that magnitude,'' Rich told reporters at the fairground.
   Product Safety Investigator Jeff Simon of the federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission said he had been assigned to the case but
declined to discuss his own investigation.
   Fair official Kieth Hessey said expressed concern for the
families of the victims, but said the fair would remain open through
Sunday, completing its scheduled run.
   On Friday, fair operators put up a Ferris wheel on the spot where
the Monster had stood.

   Television game show host Bob Barker led 2,000 chanting animal
rights activists down Fifth Avenue on Friday in the largest of
nationwide protests against the killing of animals for their fur.
   ``Fur is murder! Don't buy fur!'' they shouted, waving signs
depicting cute creatures in various stages of annihilation.
   ``Where's mom?'' said the caption on a picture of a baby racoon.
   The protest, by Trans-Species Unlimited, was one of more than 60
the group said it held around the country as part of its third
annual ``Fur-Free Friday.''
   About 40 pickets protested outside Saks Fifth Avenue and
Neiman-Marcus department stores in Beverly Hills, Calif., police
said.
   In Boston, more than 25 people clutching signs reading ``Fur _
The Ultimate Sadist Symbol'' protested in front of a fur store.
   Roxci Moser, 33, who was heckled when she walked by the
protesters in a raccoon coat, said: ``I noticed they were wearing
leather shoes and I assume they ate turkey yesterday for
Thanksgiving. If they want to act like that, they should be strict
vegetarians and wear only cloth clothes.''
   In San Francisco, where ``Gunsmoke'' actress Amanda Blake led
about 50 demonstrators in a rally, organizers said some dropped off
furs as tax-deductible donations.
   Blake explained her own decision 25 years ago to stop wearing
real fur by saying ``it's agony for the animals and I don't believe
that animals should have to suffer for some dumb broad's vanity _ or
for some stupid man's vanity, for that matter.''
   Blake defended the leather boots she was wearing, saying
producers ``use the whole cow. ... That's important.''
   In Harrisburg, Pa., where about 25 pickets walked outside a
downtown shopping center, local Trans-Species spokeswoman Silvie
Pomicter said, ``We feel it's simply outrageous and barbaric in the
1980s to be wearing the skins of animals that have been slain for
frivolous luxury garments.''
   Edissa Simpson, whose husband owns a fur store in suburban
Harrisburg, said cows and pigs are used for clothing and no one is
calling for an embargo against their slaughter.
   She said she understood animal farmers use scientific methods and
do not confine or kill animals in cruel ways. She also noted that
many people rely on furs for their livelihood.
   ``It's good for the economy,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   New York police estimated the demonstrators there at 2,000, ``at
peak,'' said Detective Joseph McConville.
   ``Two years ago on Fur-Free Friday, I stood with six other
people,'' said Steve Siegel, the group's New York City director.
   ``It's been successful beyond our wildest expectations,'' said
Barker, who quit being host of the Miss USA and Miss Universe beauty
contests last year to protest the use of fur coats as prizes.
   Barker told the crowd that in Europe, animal supporters spit on
people who wear fur.
   ``I'm happy to say that they run the same risk in New York City
now,'' Barker said, reporting that a woman had admonished him:
``Shame on you, one of your people spit on me.''
   ``I said `Only one?''' related Barker.
   During the march, dozens of shoppers stopped along the sidewalk
to stare and point. One couple, sporting his and her furs, beat a
hasty retreat.
   ``My fur is beautiful. Please don't kill me or my friends,'' read
a sign worn by a Labrador retriever.
   One woman trudged along in a beaver costume and another wore
bunny ears.
   The protesters paused outside one fur store, shouting: ``If you
stop buying, they'll stop killing!'' A few protesters angrily waved
signs.
   The group's president, George Cave, urged members to spend their
winter handing leaflets to people wearing furs on the street.
   ``If you want to be a little more aggressive and tell them how
much that fur bothers you, that's OK, too,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iran Agrees To Rights Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran said Friday that it would allow the
first visit to the country by U.N. human rights investigators next
month, a move seen aimed at countering reports that it has launched
a wave of executions.
   The General Assembly is scheduled to vote next week on a
resolution that strongly criticizes Iran for blocking a probe of
alleged human rights abuses.
   The U.N.'s special monitor on human rights in Iran, Reynaldo
Galindo Pohl, issued a preliminary report in early November that
condemned Iran for executing large numbers of opposition members
after accepting a cease-fire with Iraq.
   Galindo and his staff from the Special Commission on Human Rights
have never been allowed to visit Iran and rely on reports in Iranian
and Western media and testimony from defectors and opposition
members.
   Iranian U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati said his
country would prefer a resolution with milder language, one that
would call for Galindo to ``receive full cooperation of the
government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in all respects before
the end of 1988, for the purpose of carrying out his mandate.''
   On Wednesday, Ambassador Michael Costello of Australia, one of
the sponsors of the resolution, called upon Iran to ``give a clear,
unconditional and public indication of its readiness to allow a
visit (by human rights investigators) within a specified period.
...''
   Mahallati replied Friday, ``I have delivered today, in no
uncertain terms, what the sponsors in the draft resolution ... have
called for.''
   He said Iran's cooperation with Galindo would refute claims of
execution and torture that were made by the People's Mujahedeen of
Iran, an opposition group.
   Mahallati contended that Iran had been preoccupied by its war
with Iraq, and only now has been able to spare time to respond to
international criticism.
   He said Iran's administration of justice has been ``the most
lenient'' of any country that has gone through a revolution and
subsequent war, and that ``the members of opposition groups, however
violent, are entitled to due process of law. ...''
   The Iranian envoy said Galindo's previous report relied on ``the
People's Mujahedeen Organization, a terrorist organization, (and) is
filled with the bogus allegations leveled against the Islamic
Republic of Iran with clear malice, purely political and propaganda
objectives.''
   Galindo's interim report cited mass executions in Iran from July
through September that included 1,140 political prisoners, as well
as other common criminals.
   The executions followed a July 25-28 raid into Iran by the
National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the People's Mujahedeen,
and Iran's acceptance in mid-July of a cease-fire with Iraq. The
truce took effect Aug. 20.

<HEAD>Teacher Awarded Damages In Civil Suit For Rape</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Principals not identified since case unprecedented and may be

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A High Court judge on Friday awarded $45,200 in
damages to a 25-year-old teacher who said a physiotherapist raped
her, although the man has never been tried for the crime.
   The woman sued in the civil courts after police charged the man
with rape but the Crown Prosecution Service said evidence was
insufficient to put him on trial for a criminal offense.
   It was believed to be the first civil action for rape without a
prior conviction in a criminal court.
   Judge Sir Bernard Caulfield stayed his award to the woman pending
a possible appeal.
   The judge said he believed the 47-year-old physiotherapist
assaulted his patient in December 1985 and raped her three days
later when she returned to continue treatment for shoulder injury
and back pain.
   During the judgment, the defendant sat in court with his head in
his hands.
   The defense contended that the woman fantasized or dreamed the
rape but the judge said: ``Under the greatest stress in the
witness-box she impressed as basically a truthful woman.''
   He said the woman was shocked by the first assault but returned
to the clinic because she was too frightened to tell her father and
kept the next appointment so he would not find out.
   Defense witnesses testified they were in adjoining cubicles and
heard nothing of any assault in the clinic at Benfleet, Essex, 36
miles east of London.
   But the judge said their evidence lacked the necessary precision
for him to say the teacher lied or gave ``dishonest or fanciful''
evidence.
   Essex county police said later they did not intend to reopen
investigations, and the Crown Prosecution Service said it would need
new evidence to reopen it.
   A spokesman for the service said the burden of proof in a civil
case was on the balance of probabilities, but a criminal case
required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
   ``It's very often the case that where a story sounds more
plausible, that's sufficient for civil proceedings. Therefore, one
is able to succeed in civil litigation and obtain damages but not
succeed in achieving a criminal conviction,'' the spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Women Against Rape organization said: ``It's a big victory.
... There's a lot of rape being committed by men in positions of
authority _ teachers, doctors, lawyers, landlords.
   ``Obviously there's something very wrong with the system if the
case was originally thrown out and then a judge finds in favor of
the woman.''

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 Chileans chanted slogans, sang
protest songs and waved banners on Friday at the first human rights
demonstration allowed in 15 years of rule under military President
Augusto Pinochet.
   The protesters in this capital city passed out pamphlets and
displayed banners declaring ``Enough of Impunity'' and ``They
Torture In Chile; We Demand Justice.'' They chanted, ``Trial and
punishment now!''
   About 30 women wore photographs pinned to their bosom, of sons or
husbands who disappeared after arrest.
   Groups of human rights victims and their relatives organized the
event. They are demanding that when Chile returns to civilian rule,
authorities prosecute military and police officers accused of human
rights atrocities.
   Elections are planned for December 1989 to pick a successor to
Pinochet, the right-wing general who last month lost a referendum on
extending his presidency eight more years.
   Many local Roman Catholic leaders and opposition political
leaders have said they do not favor prosecution of the military.
They argue it could endanger the transition to democracy in Chile,
where the defense forces are apt to remain powerful.
   Pinochet seized power in a 1973 coup that toppled the elected
leftist government of President Salvador Allende, a Marxist.
   Human rights groups say about 700 people later disappeared and
thousands were arrested and tortured in a military-led wave of
anti-leftist repression.
   Municipal officials granted permission for Friday's
demonstration. While authorities had allowed some political and
labor rallies in recent months, they had never before authorized a
protest by human rights groups.

   An Eastern Airlines jetliner bound for San Francisco

   The pilot radioed that he was coming back because of an engine
failure, said Rory Reed, control tower supervisor.
   About 25 minutes into the flight, the pilot reported an oil light
on and that engine No. 3 had shut down as a result, said Eastern

   ``This occasionally happens and usually just requires a change of
(an oil) filter,'' said Ms. Sanchez. ``If there's no (other) problem
... you can turn that around fairly quickly.''
   The 78 passengers and six-member crew aboard non-stop Flight 501
waited while the plane underwent maintenance, she said.

<HEAD>New Pro-Aquino Party Takes Full Control of Lower House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate president accused a new
political party backing President Corazon Aquino of ``dictatorship''
on Friday after it cemented control of the lower house by stripping
non-members of committee chairmanships.
   The legislative revamp by the majority Struggle of the Democratic
Filipino Party on Thurday had been expected since the party was
launched in September. It represented the latest step in a
realignment of forces that helped topple President Ferdinand Marcos
in February 1986 and catapult Mrs. Aquino to power.
   ``This is one-party dictatorship,'' Sen. Jovito Salonga said in a
radio interview Friday. ``They have committed an act of injustice in
the House (of Representatives).''
   Committee chairmanships in the House were previously apportioned
to members of a six-party, pro-Aquino coalition regardless of
individual party affiliation.
   The new party, its ranks swelled by defections from other
parties, controls at least 145 of the 202 House seats. In the
reshuffle, it stripped other parties of nine chairmanships and took
control of the House's 45 committees.
   House Speaker Ramon Mitra and Rep. Jose Cojuangco, Mrs. Aquino's
politically powerful brother, said in creating the new party that
they wanted to bring all Aquino supporters under one umbrella to
boost her programs.
   Mrs. Aquino herself refuses to join any political party.
   ``The LDP now assumes full responsibility for the success or
failure of the legislative program of the government,'' Mitra said
using the party's Tagalog language initials.
   Salonga said he would not retaliate by calling for a similar
refashioning of the 23-member Senate, where the Democratic Filipino
Party holds only six seats.

   Iran on Friday renewed an offer to work
for the release of nine American hostages in Lebanon if the United
States would make the same efforts on behalf of Iranian hostages
there.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani made the offer in a Friday
prayer sermon broadcast on official Tehran radio. Other Iranian
officials have made the same suggestion in the past.
   ``If you are interested in having your people held hostage in
Lebanon released, then tell the Phalangists to release our people
who have been in their hands for years, and of whom we do not have
any news,'' Rafsanjani was quoted as saying in the broadcast, which
was monitored in Nicosia.
   In Washington, the State Department on Friday reaffirmed its
policy against making any deals for release of American hostages in
Lebanon. Spokesman Charles Redman said that all hostages, American
and Iranian alike, should be released immediately.
   Three Iranians _ Ahmad Motevaselian, Hussein Musavi and Kazem
Akhavan _ were kidnapped by right-wing Christian Phalangist gunmen
in northern Lebanon in 1982. Their Lebanese driver, who had an
Iranian passport, also disappeared. The four are widely believed to
be dead.
   Rafsanjani alleged in his sermon that the United States backed
the Christian Phalangists in Lebanon and thus could not claim it had
no influence among them, the radio said.
   If the United States helps free the Iranians, Rafsanjani said,
``we will also suggest to our well-wishers and friends in Lebanon to
release any hostages they may have.''
   Fourteen foreign hostages, including nine Americans, are being
held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists. In addition,
a Swiss Red Cross official was kidnapped in the southern port of
Sidon on Nov. 17, but no one has claimed responsibility.
   The longest-held foreign hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Rafsanjani also condemned former U.S. President Jimmy Carter for
trying to link resumption of U.S.-Iranian ties to the hostage issue.
   In a letter made public by the Iranians last week, Carter asked
Iran to release the hostages, saying it would overcome a main
obstacle to the renewal of ties between Washington and Tehran.
   ``We are neither hostage-takers or interested in resuming ties
with the U.S.,'' Rafsanjani said.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, responding to Carter's letter last
week, said ``the relationship between Iran and the U.S. is like the
relationship between a wolf and a lamb, and between these there can
never be reconciliation.''
   A spokeswoman for Carter in Atlanta said the letter was
``responding to an initiative from Iran.''
   Rafsanjani said Carter had sent him a similar letter and he was
preparing a reply.
   ``America is looking for a way to establish contact with the
Islamic Republic, and the malice of its leaders has driven it to
this (sending the letter),'' the radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying.
   ``The American leaders do not have enough courage to say, `We
have made a mistake, we mistreated the Islamic Republic, and we had
a bad attitude towards the Islamic revolution, and we want to make
up,'' Rafsanjani said.
   ``If you want to establish ties with the Islamic Republic, then
you must give up your vile schemes,'' he said.

   An earthquake rattled eastern Canada and the northeast quadrant
of the United States on Friday, but there were no immediate reports
of major damage or injuries.
   The epicenter of the 6:46 p.m. EST quake was 90 miles north of
Quebec City, Canada, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.0 on the
Richter scale of ground motion, said U.S. Geological Survey
spokesman Don Finley in Washington, D.C.
   The quake knocked out power in Montreal and elsewhere in the
province of Quebec. Canadian Press reported that the quake lasted
about 15 to 20 seconds, and also was felt in Ottawa, Toronto and
Quebec City.
   A foreshock recorded Wednesday had a Richter magnitude of 4.5,
Finley said.
   In the United States, the quake was felt from the Great Lakes to
the Atlantic Coast, with tremors reported in Michigan, Indiana,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Connecticut,
Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
   There were no reports of damage to U.S. power plants,
transmission lines, dams, and telephone lines.
   ``It was widely felt and the north-central and northeastern
regions'' of the United States, said Arch Johnston, director of the
Center for Earthquake Research at Memphis State University in
Tennessee. ``Some reported feeling it as far south as Washington,
D.C.''
   Police, firefighters, radio and television stations were deluged
with calls, officials said. Houses shook, ceilings cracked, dishes
fell from shelves and windows rattled in the Northeast.
   In New York City, firefighters went to 40 locations where there
were reports of tremors but no damage could be found, said fire Lt.
Kenneth Murphy.
   In the central Vermont community of Berlin, a chimney collapsed
but there were no injuries reported.
   In Maine, the quake broke windows and knocked pictures off walls.
However, the Secret Service in Kennebunkport, said the quake was not
felt at the weekend home of President-elect George Bush and his
wife, Barbara.
   The quake rattled Boston's Top of the Hub restaurant on the 52nd
floor of the Prudential Center while about 120 people were dining,
said maitre d' Stephen Brown. ``It was enough to make you feel
queasy,'' he said.
   ``The entire dining room felt it. Everyone felt they were
becoming dizzy or faint. They all sort of smiled and looked at each
other. No one felt panicked or anything,'' he said.
   There were scattered reports of temporarily dead telephones in
New Hampshire and Vermont, but New England Telephone spokesman Paul
Hardiman said outages could have been caused by the too many callers
jamming local exchanges.
   ``Effectively what they're doing is jamming the whole network,''
he said. ``Some switching machines, especially in smaller offices,
will deny dial tone.'' Hardiman said he had no reports of widespread
telephone outages.
   Canadian Press said the tremor was felt all over the island of
Montreal, along the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence River
as well as in the Laurentians and Quebec City.
   Traffic lights were out throughout Montreal, and there was no
electricity in major hotels and Montreal's central train station.
Telephone lines are also down around the island.
   Michel Morin of Jonquiere, where the quake was quite severe, said
the quake happened very quickly. ``I was in a store and things fell
of the shelves,'' he said. ``People ran out of their houses and
their telephones and power was gone.''
   ``I was sitting watching TV and all at once I started feeling
dizzy,'' said Roy Tabikha of Cambridge, Mass. ``I thought there was
something wrong with me, then I realized everything was shaking.''
   Tabikha said he filled a glass with water and watched it vibrate.
He said the shaking lasted about 15 seconds.
   ``We ran out of our house. Our lampshade was shaking. We were
shaking,'' said Carol Dalessandro, 40, a travel agent in Wakefield,
Mass.
   In Pennsylvania, the tremors rattled windows on the sixth floor
of Erie's Hamot Medical Center and in the control tower of Erie
International Airport, four floors above ground level.
   ``One lady called us and said she had whitecaps in her fish tank
and her chandelier was shaking,'' said Cpl. Clifford Williams of the
Pennsylvania State Police.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.
   Seismologists consider a magnitude-6 earthquake to be a moderate
jolt, even though such a quake can cause severe damage in populated
areas that lack modern building codes.
   Because the Earth's crust is much older, cooler and more brittle
east of the Rockies than in the West, eastern quakes tend to be felt
over areas 10 times larger than in the West, where complicated
geology also interferes with seismic waves as they travel through
the ground.
   ``We have had earthquakes up there before, said Waverly Person,
director of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake
Information Center at Golden, Colo. ``In 1925 there was a quake in
the area with a magnitude of 7.''
   Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the Survey, said aftershocks
could shake the area for weeks.
   ``This is what we would call an intra-plate or within the plate
earthquake,'' Presgrave said, ``which is an earthquake in the North
American plate as opposed to one along plate boundaries such as the
San Andreas Fault.''

   Organizers put the final touches Friday on the
Cleveland Style Polka Hall of Fame, which is intended to preserve
and promote the distinctive eastern European ethnic music with roots
in Slovenia.
   ``Every ethnic person likes this kind of music,'' said Nancy
Walden, who was busy Friday selling tickets to Saturday's grand
opening program for the national hall of fame.
   There are about 80,000 to 100,000 people of Slovenian descent in
the Cleveland area, the largest concentration anywhere outside
Slovenia, a region of Yugoslavia.
   Tony Petkovsek, chairman of the hall of fame, said 2,000 polka
fans, many of whom head to the Cleveland area each Thanksgiving
weekend for a traditional polka convention, were on hand in the
city, and most were expected for the grand opening. The mayors of
Cleveland and adjacent Euclid, where the hall is located, also were
expected.
   The hall of fame is in several renovated rooms of the Euclid
Shore Civic Center, a former junior high school.
   The ceremony will be held during a six-hour open house that will
include the enshrining of five inaugural hall of fame members _
Frank Yankovic, Johnny Vadnal, the late Matt Hoyer and the late
Johnny Pecon, all of the Cleveland area, and Walter Ostanek of
Ontario, Canada.
   All five already are enshrined in the International Polka
Association hall of fame in Chicago, which honors all polka
varieties.
   Petkovsek, who has catered to Slovenian polka tastes with a daily
radio show for 27 years, said Cleveland style polka features a
strong big band-flavor with more accordian and rhythm music and less
use of trumpets and horns, which are more typical of Polish and
German polkas.
   The hall of fame includes displays of classical accordians, and
photos and exhibits of highlights of the history of Cleveland style
polka, including early recording artists and the influence of radio
and television.

   Share prices edged down on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
in its half-day session Saturday, mainly due to profit-taking in
early trading, dealers said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 66.62-point winner the
previous day, lost 43.06 points, or 0.15 percent, to end the week's
trading at 29,363.59. Losing 128.21 points shortly after the market
opened, the index did not change its overall downward trend although
it recovered slightly toward the end of trading.
   Securities dealers attributed the decline to heavy profit-taking
in early trading by institutional investors after continuous gains
for the last few weeks.
   Since the beginning of November, the Nikkei index has risen
1,424.11 points, or 5.1 percent, setting new historical highs almost
daily.
   A Nomura Securities' analyst said market players, who regained
some confidence of foreign exchange stability as the dollar did not
go below the 120-yen level Friday, started buying late in the
session.
   ``Market players increasingly bought steels toward the end of the
session, which helped the index recover a little,'' said the
analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 550 million
shares.
   The foreign exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

   A U.N. report released Friday decried what
it termed growing human rights abuses and frequent use of violence
by Israeli soldiers fighting the Palestinian rebellion.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar wrote in the U.N.
review, ``The overall situation in the occupied Palestinian
territories has worsened. Civilian deaths and injuries continue to
be widespread and so do other serious violations of human rights.''
   He said he was ``deeply distressed'' by the high number of
casualties and by Israeli measures such as deportation,
administrative detention, curfews and razing of houses. He said such
measures can only aggravate tension.
   At least 315 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died in the
uprising that began against Israeli rule last Dec. 8 in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   The U.N. Center for Human Rights put together the report from
news items in newspapers. Israeli officials have not yet made a
decision on a request by U.N. officials to visit the occupied lands.
   A spokeswoman for Israel's U.N. Mission said the mission was
aware of the report but had no immediate comment.
   In Tripoli, Libya, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat met with Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi on Friday to discuss the declaration of
a Palestinian state on the occupied territories, Libya's official
news agency JANA reported. The report was monitored in Rome.
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's legislature, declared
the state this month.
   JANA said Arafat discussed ``the unjust and illegitimate
attitude'' of the U.S. government in refusing to grant him a visa to
address the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
   Washington has not yet said whether it will grant the visa to
Arafat, who hopes to attend the assembly debate on the Palestinian
question Dec. 1-2. He is expected to request U.N. membership for the
newly declared state.
   The PLO formally applied to the U.S. Consulate in Tunis, Tunisia,
on Friday for a visa for Arafat.
   State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said in Washington
that the department received the application. ``We are giving it
severe scrutiny,'' she said.
   The United States may deny such visas to people it deems to be
terrorists.

<TEXT>
   Europe and the United States plan to send a space
probe to Titan, the solar system's biggest moon and the only one
with an atmosphere much like primordial Earth's, the European Space
Agency announced Friday.
   The joint mission to Saturn's immense, gas-shrouded satellite
would begin in 1996 and include a lunar probe that may be able to
test soil from the mysterious moon.
   The mission, to be called the Cassini-Titan probe, was chosen
from a series of proposed joint projects during meetings Thursday
and Friday of the European Space Agency's Science Program Committee.
   NASA, however, still is seeking official approval for the $550
million project. It is expected to ask Congress for some funding
during the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, NASA spokesman
Charles Redmond said in Washington.
   Redmond said he expects the Europeans would contribute about $100
million to $150 million. They proposed paying for at least one major
instrument system, helping to pay for some others and providing
propulsion components.
   The project is named after 17th-century Italian astronomer
Giovanni Domenico Cassini.
   Titan is the only moon in the solar system known to have a thick,
organic-rich nitrogen atmosphere. The surface temperature is about
minus 354 degrees.
   Scientists believe that the chemical processes in Titan's
atmosphere may resemble those at work on the primitive Earth before
the origin of life.
   Cassini-Titan is to be launched in April 1996 by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and should arrive in the Saturn
system in October 2002, the European Space Agency said in a
statement.
   Saturn and its system of rings and satellites were briefly
encountered in 1980-81 during the United States' Voyager 1 and 2
missions.
   The Cassini-Titan mission will place around Saturn a NASA-built
orbiter that will send an European-built probe into Titan's
atmosphere. The probe is to slow down to subsonic speeds when it
gets within 110 miles of the moon.
   The probe is named Huygens, after the Dutch astronomer and
physicist Christian Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1656.
   A parachute system will be deployed to allow a slow descent to
the surface of Titan, which some scientists say is covered by ethane
and methane lakes or oceans. The low-velocity impact may be soft
enough to allow analysis of a surface sample before the probe dies,
the European Space Agency said.
   During the descent of Huygens, the orbiter will be used as a
radio relay station to transmit the probe's data to Earth. After
Huygen's mission, the Cassini orbiter is to circle Saturn for four
years at an altitude of only 620 miles.

<TEXT>
   A U.N. conference opened Friday to adopt
an international convention against illicit drug trafficking and
drug abuse.
   ``The convention will provide a new powerful weapon to combat
drug abuse and illicit trafficking,'' Axel Wuestenhage, deputy
director of the U.N. Information Office in Vienna, told The
Associated Press.
   ``What's very important is that they (the new rules) include
rights to forfeit assets of illicit drug traffickers and rights of
extradition given to all signatory countries for the first time,''
he said.
   The conference is scheduled to last until Dec. 20. The convention
to be adopted complements two existing international legal
instruments _ the Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 signed by 121
countries and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, to
which 88 countries have so far acceded.
   The new convention is meant to meet the challenge posed by an
upsurge in illicit drug trafficking and associated organized
criminal activity. Both are viewed as undermining legitimate
economies and threatening the stability, security and sovereignty of
U.N. member states.
   The innovations will reportedly deal with such issues as
forfeiture and confiscation of the proceeds and assets derived from
illicit trafficking, extradition, mutual legal assistance and
cooperation and training of law enforcement officials.
   Special chapters will provide for measures for international
cooperation and help for drug-transit states, monitoring of
substances frequently used in illicit manufacture of drugs,
eradicaton of illegal plant cultivation and suppression of outlawed
traffic by sea, in free-trade zones and free ports, conference
officials said.
   Francesco Ramos Galino, director of the United Nation Division of
Narcotics Drugs, said some countries that previously refused to
divulge information on secret bank accounts now are willing to do so.
   Wuestenhage said the measures have been under discussion since
1984, He said once the convention is adopted, it would be open for
signature by U.N. member states.
   To become legally binding, the convention will have to be
ratified by parliaments or other national bodies in signatory
countries.
   Delegates from about 100 countrties have sent representatives.
Bolivia's Foreign Minister Guillermo Gutierrez is president of the
conference.

   President Virgilio Barco announced Friday
night that he was invoking emergency measures to fight a growing
wave of terrorism from both right and left.
   Barco promised in a radio-TV address to ``bring down with the
weapons of justice and the aid of all Colombians'' leftist
terrorists and right-wing paramilitary squads.
   He said the emergency measures include life in prison for
terrorism-related killings, an emergency plan to increase the number
of soldiers and police, and creation of special anti-terrorist
squads.
   In addition, judges will be allowed to preside over trials
without revealing their identities and violent areas could be
brought under control of military governmers.
   Barco, leader of the Liberal Party, said the constitution allows
such emergency measures.
   Over the past year, hundreds of people have been killed and
nearly 500 others kidnapped by terrorists. Among those killed were
26 judges, a justice minister, an attorney general and two newspaper
editors.
   Growing guerrilla armies now contain about 10,000 people.
   The government has about 80,000 soldiers and 90,000 police. Barco
did not say how many more he wants.
   Barco also said the armed forces would receive modern air and
ground transportation to respond rapidly to terrorist attacks.

   A relationship born when a Navy seaman
stationed in the Persian Gulf opened a holiday greetings letter from
a Dayton woman by chance is scheduled to bloom into marriage this
weekend.
   Michael Rodriquez, 22, of Savannah, Ga., and Ruth Brame, 25, are
to exchange vows Saturday nearly a year after they became pen pals.
   The relationship began last January after Ms. Brame read a column
in the Dayton Daily News in which writer Dale Huffman suggested
readers send greetings to servicemen in the Persian Gulf who would
not be home for the holidays.
   Ms. Brame, a single, working mother, sent a card, a letter and a
picture of her 2-year-old son Earl.
   Rodriquez, who was stationed aboard the USS Elrod, said Ms.
Brame's letter was given to him by the ship's postal clerk on a day
Rodriquez received no regular mail.
   ``That was a gift from God,'' he said.
   Rodriquez said he wrote back to Ms. Brame, which resulted in a
response from her. More letters and packages followed.
   ``I fell in love with her before I even met her,'' he said.
   The two finally met face-to-face April 6 at the home of Ms.
Brames' parents in suburban Trotwood.
   ``When I first saw her, I drove up to her house (and) there was a
six-foot neon sign that said `Tom Rodriquez, Welcome to Trotwood,
Ohio. We Love You,''' he said. ``I didn't know whether to drive
around the block or pull into the driveway,'' he said, laughing.
   Ms. Brame said the two basically fell in love through the mail.
   ``All I can say about it is the Lord does work,'' said Ms. Brame.
``The attraction was there, and everything went from there.''
   Rodriquez, who is no longer in the Navy, said that after the
church wedding the couple plan to move to Savannah, where he will
try his hand at the restaurant business.

   A severe earthquake hit eastern Canada Friday,
shaking buildings, knocking out power and frightening thousands of
people. A major rail line was shut down after a section of track
reportedly collapsed near Montreal.
   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries.
   The earthquake measured 6.0 on the Richter scale with an
epicenter at Chicoutimi, Quebec, said Janet Drysdale, seismologist
with the Geological Survey of Canada. Chicoutimi is about 200 miles
northeast of Montreal.
   ``This is the largest earthquake in eastern Canada since 1935,''
said John Adams of the Geological Survey of Canada in Ottawa.
   The quake was felt throughout eastern Canada, including in
Montreal, Toronto, Quebec City, Ottawa and along the shores of the
St. Lawrence River. It also was felt in the northeastern United
States.
   Tremors began at 6:46 p.m. EST and lasted from 15 seconds to two
minutes, Canadian Press reported.
   The news agency said traffic lights were out in Quebec City, and
there was no electricity in Montreal's central train station and
major hotels. Telephone lines also were down around the island.
   Canadian Press said the tremors caused the ground to cave in
beneath a railway track just west of Montreal at the approach to a
railway bridge. It said the damage forced Canadian National railroad
officials to shut down the major east-west rail line from Montreal
to Senneterre, 220 miles to the west.
   The tremors caused a fluorine gas leak at the Alcan aluminum
smelter in Jonquiere, Quebec, 25 miles west of Chicoutimi, but leak
was repaired shortly afterward, the agency said.
   Another tremor was felt Wednesday and was centered in the same
southeastern section of Quebec, the Charlevoix region, said Adams.
That quake measured 4.5 to 4.9 on the Richter scale. No serious
damage was reported during that tremor.
   Radio stations and newspapers were flooded with telephone calls
from panicked residents.
   ``We're on the seventh floor and I thought we were going to be on
the first,'' said Charlie Popejoy, 80, of the central Ontario city
of Orillia.
   The quake shook the southern part of New Brunswick and was felt
as far east as the Annapolis Valley on Nova Scotia's western shore.
   ``The whole apartment building started to shake, wobble back and
forth,'' one caller told a Toronto radio station who said he was on
the top floor. ``Knives lined up on the wall and the coffee mugs
hanging on hooks on the wall started to clatter and shake back and
forth.''
   ``We've had about 100 calls here in the last five minutes,'' a
reporter at the Toronto Sun said.
   A police spokesman from Laurentian Park, just north of Quebec
City, said: ``In a restaurant next to our office a dishwasher broke
and a cigarette display came crashing to the ground.''
   Power was out in Quebec City and a high-voltage power line
between Toronto and Ottawa was momentarily interupted, Canadian
Press reported.
   There were no immediate reports of damage, however.
   In Moncton, New Brunswick, people watching an American Hockey
League game at the 7,000-seat Moncton Coliseum got up from their
seats when the quake shook the building, CP said.
   Jackie Finnemore, a clerk at a Fredericton gas bar and
convenience store, said the store's telephone went dead for a few
minutes.
   ``I hung on to the counter, I didn't know what was happening.''
   Drysdale said tremors measuring above a magnitude of 5.0 on the
Richter scale happen about once every 10 year.
   ``There is a possibility there may be slight damage with a quake
this size ... but not devastating damage by any means,'' she said.
   The tremor reportedly lasted 20 seconds in Ottawa.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage; a 6 severe damage, and a 7 is a ``major''
earthquake.

   The government on Friday ordered the arrest
of a city policeman linked to the shooting death of a 14-year-old
boy during a nationwide general strike.
   Three people were also wounded by buckshot and 35 were arrested
in other violence in Quito and the port city of Guayaquil during the
communist-led strike on Thursday, officials said.
   Interior Minister Andres Vallejo ordered policeman Juan Arteaga
held for an investigation into the boy's shooting.
   He identified the boy as Miguel Vilana and said the death took
place during a street protest in Quito, but gave no details.
   The government said newly elected President Rodrigo Borja visited
the boy's parents on Friday and promised an inquiry.
   The strike was the first against Borja's center-left government.
He took office Aug. 10 and imposed austerity measures aimed at
reducing inflation and solving other economic problems.
   The United Front of Laborers, the nation's most powerful labor
organization, called the work stoppage to protest the measures.

   Christmas shoppers wading into the post-Thanksgiving rush today
face a little added pressure this year: tight inventories. That's a
business decision prompted by a long-running slump in the retail
business, but for consumers it means limited selection and shortages
of hot-selling items.
   Today's opening of the nation's annual shopping spree finds
retailers optimistic about improving their seasonal sales, but
conservative enough to stock sparingly.
   Inventories have been tight for much of the year, and few
retailers are likely to take many chances at this point.

   The government said it will not
send black leader Nelson Mandela back to prison when he completes
his hospital stay but will keep him under guard at an unspecified
location.
   A brief statement on Thursday by Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee
did not give any details on when Mandela would leave the hospital,
where he would be taken, or what restrictions he would face.
   The 70-year-old Mandela, head of the African National Congress
guerrilla movement, has been recovering from tuberculosis since
August at the Constantiaberg Clinic in Cape Town. Dirk de Villiers,
a spokesman for Coetsee, said today that Mandela is still at the

   Laboratory experiments announced today show
that a plant toxin combined with a synthetic protein is able to
attack and kill cells infected with the AIDS virus while leaving
healthy cells untouched.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, a group of
researchers report that a manmade molecule called recombinant CD4
can be used to deliver a killer toxin to cells infected with AIDS in
test-tube experiments.
   However, they cautioned that the new laboratory development _
like other incremental advances in AIDS research _ was far from
being ready for clinical application and, at best, might offer a
potential new treatment approach rather than a cure.

   The Farmers Home Administration is mailing out
today the last of 83,480 delinquency notices to farmers who owe more
than $8 billion in past-due government loans.
   Agency officials began sending out the notices by certified mail
on Nov. 15 telling FmHA borrowers they have 45 days to complete and
return the nine forms. Basically, the notices tell farmers about the
options they have for settling their debt, including restructuring
and write-offs.
   Congress ordered FmHA in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to
revise its lending practices, including ways to handle long-overdue
debt owed by thousands of farmers. Parts of the law were put into
effect earlier in the year but debt write-down, or forgiveness,
kicked in this month. The purpose of the notices is to give
delinquent borrowers an opportunity to let FmHA know how they want
to handle their debt under the new law's provisions.

   Military President Augusto Pinochet, his
15-year-old rule nearing an end, is swiftly moving his army back to
the barracks and away from the political battlefield where he
suffered a major defeat in October.
   Political observers and specialists say recent government and
military appointments by Pinochet are aimed at restoring the army's
professionalism and reaffirming his leadership over the service,
which has served as the backbone of his power since a 1973 coup.
   ``He is trying to preserve the army after the electoral defeat he
led it into,'' said Ricardo Lagos, a socialist and prominent
opposition leader. In an Oct. 5 referendum, Chilean voters rejected
a proposal by Gen. Pinochet and other military commanders that he
remain in power until 1997. As a result, he was obliged to call open
elections, planned for late next year, and must hand over power in
March 1990.

<HEAD>In Sweden, Public can Read Prime Minister's Mail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA JANZON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Sweden, citizens can walk into the
Prime Minister's office and read his mail. They also can peek into
government records and find out a lot about a neighbor, from salary
to debts.
   As a matter of policy, government records have been open to the
public since 1766, when a political party known as the Caps ousted
the rival Hats from government in an election fought over charges
that the Hats were keeping too many things secret.
   Now, in the era of the computer and probing media, some Swedes
complain about invasions of their privacy.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson is not one of them, however.
   Of 5,577 documents that crossed his desk in the first 10 months
of this year, only 109 were classified. The majority were internal
memos and correspondence with foreign governments.
   Vivianne Eriksson, who registers the mail and indexes the
documents on a computer, said not many people take advantage of the
privilege of going through Carlsson's mail.
   She estimated that no more than one visitor a week, usually a
journalist, comes into her office for a look.
   ``I suppose most people don't know they can come here,'' she said.
   Scanning the computer index, a reporter recentlly found subjects
ranging from theories about who murdered Carlsson's predecessor,
Olof Palme, to requests for an autograph.
   Other letters were appeals for political asylum and complaints
about pollution or the hunting of moose.
   This entry was about correspondence from Maj-Britt Hedlund of
Boden: ``Wants a new kitchen and to find Palme's killer.''
   A letter of thanks to Walid Jumblatt, leader of Lebanon's Druse
community, was classified ``secret.'' So was a letter from President
Reagan on nuclear disarmament. Memos on military subjects and on
trips abroad by government officials also bore the stamp of secrecy.
   The principle of public access is not limited to authorities. The
highly developed Swedish bureaucracy has numbered, registered,
compiled and processed information about the citizenry, most of
which is open to the public.
   Every Swedish resident has a 10-digit ``personal number,'' which
begins with the birthday. Knowing your neighbor's date of birth is
enough to gain access to his file at the National Taxation Board
which lists his income and tax from the previous year, his church
membership, marital status and current address.
   If you take that number to the county police, you can find out if
he has any unpaid bills and how much he owes. Other registers list
his education, state of health and his hobbies if he is a member of
an association.
   All this has been accepted as a price for keeping people honest
in a society that strives for equality among its citizens. But
hundreds of people complain every year that authorities and private
companies abuse public records.
   Such complaints come to Data Inspection, a 40-member department
of the Justice Ministry that monitors compliance with the
regulations governing access to information and privacy.
   The department was set up in 1973 when the government instituted
a law to guard against misuse of the personal number. Criminal files
are restricted, as are files about cases of serious social problems.
   Further efforts to limit access have failed to find the right
balance between the public's right to know and the protection of
privacy, said Leif Stenstrom, an official of Data Inspection.
   ``There's been a U-turn,'' he added. ``From enabling the common
man to control the authorities, you could say (free access) now
helps the authorities to control the common man.''
   Peter Seipel, a law professor at Stockholm University, said the
idea endorsed by the Caps 200 years ago _ that men of power and high
rank need watching _ still applies.
   ``The principle of public access is an important part of our
democracy, although the judicial right is not often used,'' Seipel
said in an interview.
   ``One cannot imagine a society without it now. Administrative
secrecy would reign.''
   Marie Kronmarker, lecturer at the Fojo journalism school, said
reporters don't exercise their right to find out what's happening at
the top.
   Everyone has the right to appeal the classification of a document
as secret, she said, but journalists were too often intimidated by
the label of secrecy or by difficulty of locating mislaid documents.

<HEAD>Officials Say Drug Money Could Influence Bolivian Elections</HEAD>

   U.S. and Bolivian authorities say
corruption of police, military and court officials by cocaine
traffickers is rampant despite government efforts to contain it.
They fear drug money will influence the elections for a new
president and Congress in May.
   One reason given is that joint U.S.-Bolivian drug enforcement in
the field has become so effective that traffickers now are turning
to bribing officials to win the release of those arrested.
   Jorge Alderrete, Interior Ministry undersecretary for drug
enforcement, and other Bolivian authorities said in interviews they
suspect drug traffickers might help finance some campaigns,
including the one for president.
   ``Drug related corruption has become endemic in certain law
enforcement circles, and drug traffickers will no doubt try to
influence the elections,'' Alderrete said.
   Congressman Fernando Salazar said, ``Drug traffickers offer
financing, and this provides the base for political campaigns that
must spend large sums on television advertising.''
   Bolivians will vote for a successor to President Victor Paz
Estenssoro as well as a new Congress. With substantial U.S.
assistance, Paz Estenssoro's 3-year-old conservative government has
waged a firm but uphill battle against a cocaine industry that reaps
an estimated $500 million in yearly profits.
   According to Bolivian officials, accounts of corruption abound in
a web of complicity among traffickers, policemen, soldiers and court
officials.
   In September, police caught an alleged trafficker, Carmelo Nunez
del Prado, in a pickup truck they say was loaded with 1,125 pounds
of coca paste in the Chapare region. U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents working in Bolivia describe Nunez del Prado as
one of the country's biggest dealers in paste, which is made from
mashed coca leaves and is refined into cocaine.
   After the arrest, Alderrete said, an associate of Nunez del Prado
offered the national police force's anti-drug commander, Col.
Nicolas Anaya, $50,000 in return for the suspect's release. Anaya
refused the bribe, the undersecretary added.
   But after Nunez del Prado was jailed in city of Cochabamba, it
took police 20 days to pass the case to the district attorney when
normally it takes two to three days. The original police report was
altered and after a 10-minute hearing District Attorney Nora Vasquez
de Montoya released him for lack of evidence.
   The suspected trafficker has vanished. Mrs. Vasquez de Montoya
was jailed but later released. Interior Minister Juan Carlos Duran
said she faces charges of receiving a bribe.
   ``I have strong evidence that the $50,000 was paid to the
district attorney and a police adviser,'' Alderrete said.
   Cochabamba, in the eastern foothills of the Andes, is considered
the gateway to the Chapare, a jungle area the size of New Jersey
where 80 percent of the country's coca is grown. Several police and
military officials assigned to the area are alleged to have provided
protection to traffickers in return for payments of $10,000 to
$15,000 a week.
   Gen. Gustavo Arrazola, chief of the army's biggest regiment, and
four other officers were dishonorably discharged in October. They
were accused by the government of protecting a clandestine airstrip
from which 7,900 pounds of coca paste worth at least $10 million was
smuggled over a three-month period.
   Authorities claim some poorly paid policemen seek assignments in
the Chapare, even though living conditions are difficult. Many
officers leave the region as rich men after even a brief assignment,
the officials say.
   When a private loan institution collapsed in La Paz last year,
among the list of people who lost their deposits were 17 Bolivian
policemen, including a top drug-enforcement officer. Each had the
equivalent of $100,000 to $150,000 in the bank, according to
government records.
   Alderrete said he often tries to change police assignments to
discourage corruption.
   In addition, according to Interior Minister Duran, an increased
U.S. presence since 1986, including 30 U.S. drug enforcement and
border patrol agents who often work with local police, has made
bribery of Bolivian officers more difficult.
   The U.S. assistance is helping stem some of the drug production
and smuggling. In October, Bolivian anti-drug police and U.S. agents
raided and destroyed a record 12 major cocaine processing
laboratories in the jungle.
   Duran said two men arrested at one of the labs, the biggest ever
to be discovered, testified that they worked for the fugitive
trafficker Jorge Roca Suarez.
   The two workers were taken to the city of Trinidad, considered a
major international drug smuggling center, where authorities began
preparing charges against Roca Suarez. There, according to Duran,
five lawyers hired by the trafficker offered money and property to a
Trinidad district attorney in return for her help. The district
attorney rejected the offer, but was told her refusal to cooperate
would jeopardize her children. She resigned from the case.
   A new district attorney, Jorge Palma Sandoval, took over and
threw out the testimony of the two workers. He accepted the
testimony of a new witness who said the ranch were the lab was found
belonged to him, and that chemicals at the site were used for
tanning leather. The case against Roca Suarez was dropped.
   Palma Sandoval is being removed from his post while authorities
investigate his action in the case, Duran said.
   Duran also said that as U.S.-backed raids have increased, the
bribery of court officials is rising.
   ``Since we have become much more effective at interdiction,
traffickers are now corrupting the judicial system and making us
waste time arresting traffickers who later will be released by the
courts,'' Duran added in an interview.
   In a bid to stifle the corruption, a tough anti-drug law passed
in August calls for setting up special three-judge panels dedicated
exclusively to handling drug cases. The theory is three judges will
be tougher to suborn than one.
   Despite the bleak picture, Duran said, the corruption problem can
be controlled.
   ``Without a doubt, one of the evils of our time is corruption of
the police, courts and elections,'' he said. ``It is not fair to
say, however, that everybody is corrupt, although few cases make it
appear as if it were widespread.''

<HEAD>Lawyers Argue Japan's Legal System Violates Human Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KOBE, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly everyone brought to trial on criminal
charges in Japan is convicted.
   This has raised questions about the fairness of the nation's
legal system and whether human rights are violated.
   The Japan Federation of Bar Associations, which groups the
nation's lawyers, has long argued that the nearly 100-percent
conviction rate actually symbolizes a legal system so out of balance
that it violates international human rights covenants.
   From a prosecutors' point of view, the high success level in the
courts is a source of pride and is cited as evidence of the
efficiency of law enforcement in Japan.
   ``Very few people are found innocent here because in our system
we try only those we believe we can convict,'' said a Justice
Ministry official.
   The official, who requested anonymity, said that 99.8 percent of
all defendants facing criminal charges are found guilty, though not
necessarily on all charges brought by the prosecution. Cases in
Japan are heard by judges only; there are no juries.
   In a statement Nov. 4, the bar federation argued: ``There are
several ways to interpret the (conviction) statistic, but the
overemphasis on confessions, the violation of the rights of the
accused and the restriction of the accused's access to legal counsel
can be suspected.''
   Speakers at a recent bar federation symposium in Kobe contended
that the post-arrest treatment of suspects not yet formally charged
was a major source of human rights abuse.
   The treatment, they argue, includes physical and mental torture,
round-the-clock surveillance and inordinately long periods of
interrogation.
   ``When they were finished with me you couldn't tell the top of my
head from the side,'' said Yoshimitsu Umeda, who spent nearly 19
years in prison for a murder-robbery committed in 1950.
   Umeda told the symposium the police led him through the
confession, telling him what to say he had done, kicking and
punching him for days until his statement matched their conclusions.
   Following several appeals, Umeda's name was cleared by the
Supreme Court in 1986 due to discrepancies in his confession.
   ``There is no assumption of innocence,'' attorney Takashi Mikami
said at the symposium. ``Japanese judges find it easy to find the
accused guilty, but it takes courage for a judge to hand down a
verdict of innocent.''
   The bar federation claims the excesses that led to Umeda's false
confession continue and are fostered, in part, by the ``diayo
kangoku'' system, which allows arrested suspects to be detained in
cells where they are under constant police control.
   The police detention cells serve as substitutes for
government-designated detention centers. Two bills that would
institutionalize the system, accepted on a temporary basis 80 years
ago, are now before the Diet, Japan's parliament.
   ``This system, unique to Japan, where substitute jailhouses are
used to obtain confessions upon which many criminal cases are based,
is the source of numerous human rights violations,'' said human
rights advocate Futaba Igarashi.
   Igarashi said that in the substitute cells, known as birdcages,
police decide when suspects can eat, drink or go to the toilet.
About 90 percent of the suspects detained by police end up in such
cells, according to the federation.
   In most cases, warrants to arrest and detain a suspect must be
obtained from a court, but, the bar federation says, only 0.45
percent of the requests for detention were denied in 1984, the most
recent year for which statistics are available.
   The maximum period a suspect may be held following arrest and
before formal charges are filed is 23 days. That period is often
extended, however, as police can re-arrest suspects on unrelated
charges to continue their questioning.
   ``The detainees can't read newspapers, listen to the radio, make
telephone calls or, with a few exceptions, write letters,'' Igarashi
said. ``When they deny police accusations, they aren't allowed to
see their families and in some cases are only allowed to see their
lawyer for three 15-minute visits over the 23 days.''
   Government-appointed lawyers are not provided to the accused
during detention, though such counsel is available for the trial.
   Release on bail is not permitted until formal charges are
pressed. Only about 27 percent of those charged with crimes in 1984
were released pending trial, and of them, 60 percent posted bail of
about $7,600, according to the bar federation.
   Detainees awaiting trial are either kept in the substitute jail
cell or moved to a formal detention center following police and
court consultation.
   Jun Kurata, assistant chief of the National Police Agency's
General Affairs Division, denied many of human-rights advocate
Igarashi's charges, saying detainees in substitute jailhouses are
overseen by police guards, not investigators.
   Kurata said he was unaware of any recent cases of police
brutality during questioning and said detainees are allowed to read
newspapers if they so request.
   He said phone calls are restricted and mail is screened, but that
the same restrictions are observed in regular detention centers.

   When their single, ``Another Lover,'' hit the
American charts, Giant Steps joined the growing list of British acts
that have found success across the Atlantic before gaining
popularity at home.
   ``I don't know why it's happening, but it probably has something
to do with the quality of the songs,'' said George McFarlane,
one-half of the duo Giant Steps.
   ``If you look at the songs that have been successful in America,
they are very good. I think the American market is more about songs.
The British charts are more gimmicky. They just tend to latch on to
trends.''
   In the past, Americans have accepted only the cream of the
British charts. U2 and George Michael were successful years before
the United States took notice.
   But American record companies are now taking chances on
previously unsuccessful British bands, turning them into American
pop stars and exporting them back for re-release in Britain.
   The situation also occurred with Breathe's single, ``Hands to
Heaven.'' After failing in Britain, it was released in the United
States where it stayed in Billboard's Top 10 for several weeks.
Subsequently re-released in Britain, its American success pushed it
into the Top 20. A few weeks later, The Escape Club hit No. 2 with
``Wild, Wild West.'' It is now moving up the British charts as is
Giant Steps' peppy dance single, ``Another Lover.''
   ``Already, we are noticing a better reaction to the record this
time around,'' McFarlane said. ``It's getting more air play, and the
general vibe is a bit better _ all because it was a hit in America.''
   McFarlane and partner Colin Campsie recorded their album, ``The
Book of Pride'' in Los Angeles with American producers, which may
explain the record's American appeal. They began working with an
American producer last year, but he was too busy to devote enough
time to them.
   ``In the end, we just got fed up, so we sacked him,'' said
McFarlane. ``It caused problems because our record company said,
`You just can't come to LA and sack your producer.' We said, `Well,
we have, so goodbye.'''
   Their insouciance clearly did them no harm, because they returned
to Los Angeles in the fall and started work with songwriter-producer
Gardner Cole who wrote Madonna's hit, ``Open Your Heart.''
   Cole co-wrote their hit, ``Another Lover,'' and helped with their
next single, ``Into You.''
   McFarlane said input from an outsider was both helpful and
difficult. ``Gardner's writing influences are similar to ours so
that was great. But it's difficult writing with someone else,
because songwriting is a very personal thing, and having someone
else involved can be a problem.''
   Before becoming Giant Steps, McFarlane and Campsie were known as
The Quick. Under that name, they released a couple of albums, and
had good reviews but few sales.
   ``We changed the name because we decided there was a certain
stigma attached to The Quick. We had released records for quite a
few years, but they were never commercially successful. We finally
decided that, at least in this country, we'd never get DJs to notice
our records as The Quick. Plus, we felt we needed a fresh start.
That's what this is for us, a new start.''
   The fresh start may include an American hit, but McFarlane said
it's still important to be successful in Britain.
   ``Having success in the UK leads to things in Europe, so that
would be nice,'' he said. ``But most of all, it's just nice to be
appreciated by the people in your own country. It's our home, so of
course we'd like to have success here.''

<HEAD>Top British Record Producer Is American</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDY ADZGERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>London (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British pop followers may be surprised to learn
that Stephen Hague isn't British. It was certainly news to the
British Phonographic Industry.
   Hague is one of the top pop producers in this country, a figure
so familiar on the local music scene that few people know he's
actually American.
   Thus the information came as a shock to the BPI, that bastion of
British music, when it decided to nominate him as ``British Producer
of the Year'' for 1986, following his success with The Pet Shop
Boy's single ``West End Girls.''
   The BPI had to withdraw the nomination because its rules say only
Britons are eligible.
   ``My manager phoned them to let them know I'm American,'' Hague,
35, said in an interview at London's Advision studios. ``They said,
`Oh, that's too bad, because he's going to win.'''
   Hague, a Bostonian, has made his name producing hits by The Pet
Shop Boys, Orchestral Manouvres In The Dark, New Order and Erasure.
He is rarely out of the Top 10, but has built a reputation as an
individualist, rather than a formula hitmaker.
   ``Stephen Hague isn't associated with a restricted style,'' said
Paul Trynka, Editor of Britain's International Musician and
Recording World magazine. ``That's why he's maintained his
credibility.''
   Unlike producers whose songs ``are interchangeable no matter who
their artist is, Hague tends to consider the band and the song and
work from there. He's seen as being much more versatile,'' Trynka
said.
   Hague's first productions were of his own band, Jules And The
Polar Bears. After they split up in 1979, he got deeper into
recording. ``Technically speaking, things were a little backwards
back then,'' Hague recalled. ``But it was good learning that way.
   ``I'd be a little concerned about people coming into the
technical side of the business now. There are a lot of things people
in my generation learned that they don't have the opportunity to
learn now. It was harder to make things work then. You had to try
and get a good sound without much equipment.''
   With modern technology, anyone with enough money can make a
decent-sounding record, Hague says. ``It's too easy. They've got
this great drum sound, or horn samples, and they've got the Miami
beat or the Chicago sound, but they haven't got a song. A lot of
people skip the idea of having a good song these days.''
   Besides his recent work with American singer Jane Wiedlan, Hague
works exclusively with British acts, preferring their energy and
originality. ``The whole British scene is just much more vibrant,''
he says.
   In 1979, singer Peter Gabriel gave a Hague tape to his recording
company, Charisma, which liked it enough to hire him as a producer.
His first hit was with the British band Rock Steady Crew.
   He now works in Britain, France, Norway and Australia, commuting
between hotels and rented apartments. But he considers Boston his
home, and owns a house there.
   ``I didn't wake up one day and say, `I'd like to be a producer,'
but now I think it is the best job in the music business,'' Hague
said.
   ``The main reason is that my career doesn't rise and fall with
each individual release the way an artist's does. An artist can wait
10 to 18 months between releases and one flop can affect them for a
long time. If I have a flop now, I have something else coming out
almost immediately.''
   His failures are rare. That's why artists wait so long for Hague
to become available. He's booked through May 1989.
   ``It's a great position to be in, so even though it's a lot of
work, I'd be stupid to back off,'' he said. ``I've worked a long
time to be where I am now.''
   He says he would have liked the BPI award, but has no hard
feelings. ``I don't really need awards _ big validating gestures of
my work,'' he says. ``That's not necessary. I'm pretty content with
myself.''

<HEAD>Move Over ```Crocodile' Dundee,'' the Bush Tucker Man Is Here</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A real-life ```Crocodile' Dundee'' is
heading for America. Meet the Bush Tucker Man, Australia's newest
folk hero.
   But unlike the character made famous by Paul Hogan in two hit
movies, Les Hiddins is for real, and his TV show on how to survive
on food found in the bush is one of the most popular programs around.
   A major in the Australian army, Hiddins has spent 10 years in the
bush showing soldiers how to survive on tucker, Australian slang for
food. Bush tucker is food that abounds in the bush, such as ``crocky
apples,'' ``mangrove worms,'' ``matchbox beans,'' ``supple jack'' (a
kind of celery) and ``witchety grubs'' which resemble giant worms
and taste like cashew nuts.
   Snakes and lizards also get the thumbs up from Hiddins.
   He says he never gets ill, but a typical Hiddins bush menu might
make the less adventurous slightly queasy.
   Supper to him might be ``devil's guts'' with fruit from a plant
he calls ``dog's vomit tree'' because it tastes so awful, washed
down with water from a billabong, the aboriginal word for pond.
   ``When I can, I eat steak and eggs like all Australians,'' he
said. ``But it doesn't always work out right. That's when you start
scratching for food.''
   Napoleon Bonaparte, who said an army marches on its stomach, may
have had second thoughts if he had seen Hiddins' menu. But to the
Australian army Hiddins is a hero who deserves a medal.
   Thanks to the hidden things he finds, and talks about on his
show, the army is mapping entire northern Australia from the
Kimberleys in the West to Cape York in the East _ with photographs
of what's edible in each area _ just in case Australian soldiers are
ever forced to live off the land in the Outback.
   ``The army is indebted to him,'' said Lt. Col. Ian Edwardeson.
``If Australians ever find themselves at war in those areas, the
army would know how to survive. You can't put a price on that.''
   Hiddins is not easy to reach. He has covered 31,000 miles in his
quest for undiscovered bush foods. He spends eight months of the
year in the bush, and in a recent interview attributed ``99.9
percent'' of his bush tucker knowledge to aborigines. He has listed
600 kinds of foods.
   ``When I was a kid I used to eat bush tucker,'' he said. ``I used
to eat the odd green ant.''
   His hobby developed after reading about Australian explorers who
perished in the interior for lack of food in areas indigenous
aborigines regard as a pantry.
   In one episode of ``Bush Tucker Man,'' Hiddins stood in the wreck
of an American B-24 bomber, Little Eva, which had crashed in
northern Queensland in 1942 during World War II. Three American crew
members perished because they didn't know what to eat in the bush.
   ``The whole area in which they perished is loaded with food; it's
like a supermarket,'' Hiddins said.
   The army has published 400 different maps of Hiddins'
gastronomical guide to the Outback and several hundred more are to
be printed, Edwardeson said.
   The swarthy 42-year-old bushman is to quit the army next year to
become a civilian consultant to the army.
   According to Australian Broadcasting Corp. production manager
Anne Chivas, ``Bush Tucker Man'' is one of the network's most
popular programs. She said it has been offered to the United States
and a second series may be in the making.
   ``Bush Tucker Man'' is the latest television series in which
Australians are rediscovering the Outback. The ```Crocodile'
Dundee'' movies were smash hits here and in America. ``The Nature of
Australia,'' a PBS series celebrating Australia's bicentennial, won
rave reviews here.
   Aborigines, Australia's indigenous inhabitants, have always known
the bush was a supermarket, as well as a giant drugstore. For
centuries, they used plants, leaves and barks to solve ailments
ranging from arthritis and stomach problems to flu, skin sores and
itching.
   ``I used to think (aboriginal remedies) were hocus pocus,'' said
Andy Barr, a pharmacist with the Northern Territory Health
Department. ``Not anymore.''

<HEAD>Site of Miracle of Loaves and Fishes Becomes Israeli Sanctuary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TABIGHA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The patch of beach on the Sea of Galilee
where Jesus is believed to have performed the miracle of the loaves
and fishes has become a sanctuary from the violence of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Palestinian activists wounded in the nearly year-long uprising
against Israel live side by side in Tabigha with handicapped
Israelis and German volunteers.
   ``In this place there is no room for violence,'' said Johannes
Roelofsen, a West German social worker who four years ago founded
the Tabigha resort for the handicapped nestled amid palm trees and
flower beds on the northern tip of the Sea of Galilee.
   ``The spirit of the place is still present, a place where all of
a sudden 5,000 people became a community,'' he said, referring to
the New Testament account of the miracle in which Jesus fed 5,000
followers with five loaves of bread and two fishes.
   Roelofsen, a large bearded man from Wissen an der Sieg in West
Germany, spoke in Tabigha's outdoor dining area where Palestinians
in wheelchairs and young German volunteers sat around large wooden
tables, noisily sharing a simple rice dish.
   ``The intefadeh (Palestinian uprising) is making us all a little
crazy. Here we can have some fun and forget what's happening in the
West Bank,'' said one of the diners, Hassan Dahdouh, a 24-year-old
laborer from the West Bank's Nablus whose right leg has been rigid
since being shot in the knee during a clash with Israeli troops in
March.
   In a later interview, Ephraim Moore, 35, an Israeli paralyzed by
polio, said: ``I met a girl from the West Bank in Tabigha. We went
to a conert in Jerusalem together.''
   Tabigha and the adjacent Church of the Multiplication of Loaves
and Fishes are administered by the Roman Catholic Benedictine Order
and financed by donations from around the world. Handicapped guests
stay free, sleeping in simple huts and helping with the chores.
   After the first victims of the uprising began to arrive,
Roelofsen recruited an Israeli physiotherapist, Daniela Epstein, to
set up exercise routines. He said hospitals in the occupied lands
don't provide rehabilitation programs.
   Ms. Epstein, a volunteer, said many Palestinians were initially
suprised to be treated by an Israeli but quickly settled into a work
routine.
   One of her patients is Akram Muktassab, a 23-year-old paraplegic
from Hebron on the West Bank who was shot by Jewish settlers last
year. He was using a wheelchair until he met Ms. Epstein who taught
him to walk along parallel bars, his legs encased in plaster casts.
   ``He was very excited when he took the first steps,'' Ms. Epstein
said. ``He cried. He couldn't believe he could do it.''
   Muktassab said meeting Ms. Epstein has helped him get over the
hatred he felt for Jews after being wounded.
   ``Daniela is Jewish, but she helped me,'' said Muktassab, his
muscular arms resting on his withered legs.
   Other Palestinians are less conciliatory.
   ``I want to take revenge, and build up my arms so I can throw
stones again,'' said Amer Albasha, 24, a tailor from Nablus who has
been walking on crutches since April when, he said, he was beaten
unconscious while in army custody.
   Albasha spoke while sitting on the floor with his legs stretched
out and pushing up his lower body with his arms. The exercise was
designed for him by Ms. Epstein.
   ``This is certainly not my intention,'' Ms. Epstein said in
response to Albasha's remarks. ``But Palestinians also have a right
to rehabilitation, regardless of politics.''
   Roelofsen, 39, said when handicapped Israelis and Palestinians
first meet at Tabigha, they are usually suspicious of one another
and sometimes get entangled in political arguments.
   ``But after a while, the handicap becomes more important,'' he
said. ``They talk about where you can find the best wheelchairs.''
   Roelofsen cited a recent encounter between Jewish teen-agers in
wheelchairs and Palestinian youths from broken homes.
   ``The Jewish kids wanted to go swimming in the lake, but we
didn't have enough attendants to take them,'' he said. ``So the
Palestinian kids took them into the water.''
   Friction does exit at Tabigha, but it's usually over things other
than the Palestinian conflict.
   For example, Albasha shouted at Maria Gorius, 25, a volunteer
exercise coach from Saabruecken who had taken one of his crutches in
an effort to prod him into walking again.
   This kind of straightforward treatment is a new experience for
the handicapped, Roelofsen said.
   ``They feel for the first time what it's like to be accepted as
equals.''

<HEAD>Sarcasm Is Trademark of SNL's `Weekend Update' Anchor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is Dennis Miller, the sarcastic, wisecracking
anchor of ``Saturday Night Live,'' too smart of a smart-aleck?
   Miller's sardonic style and obscure asides are what make his
humor work _ but they sometimes work against him.
   David Letterman, arguably the Sultan of Sarcasm, recently needled
Miller for making a particularly esoteric reference.
   ``It's Doctor IQ, Paul _ he's here tonight,'' Letterman sneered
to bandleader Paul Shaffer.
   A Chicago Sun-Times critic, while calling Miller ``hip'' and
``brilliant,'' said the persistent put-downs in his recently
released video ``make him sound like a pompous jerk by the tape's
end.''
   Even SNL has poked fun at Miller. Colleague Dana Carvey showed up
on ``Weekend Update'' to do a perfect impression of Miller while
sitting right next to him, flipping the hair and smirkingly calling
everybody ``Cha-cha.''
   But the style seems to be working.
   This fall is Miller time. He was married earlier this year and
just celebrated his 35th birthday. His stand-up routines can be
bought on video (``Live from Washington ... It's Dennis Miller'') or
on record (``The Off-White Album'') and he received three Awards for
Cable Excellence nominations for his HBO special, ``Mr. Miller Goes
to Washington.''
   Then there's the regular exposure on SNL as ``Weekend Update''
anchor, the role originated by Chevy Chase. The fall presidential
campaign provided a mother lode of material.
   One jibe: ``Now let me get this straight _ Bush is anti-abortion,
but pro-death penalty. It guess it's all in the timing, huh?''
   And another, inspired by a picture of Dan Quayle holding a
pumpkin: ``What's the difference between these two spherical
objects? One of them will eventually have a light in it.''
   In October, Michael Dukakis was shown in a videotape playing the
trumpet _ with ``Taps'' dubbed on the audio.
   Miller, a Pittsburgh native who studied journalism at Point Park
College, labored for years as a stand-up comic before being spotted
by SNL veterans Al Franken and Tom Davis. Producer Lorne Michaels,
putting together a new cast for the 1985 season, tapped him to
anchor the ``Weekend Update'' segment.
   ``I have the luckiest life in the world. I pinch myself,''
Miller, sounding not the least bit pompous, said recently in his
small, 17th-floor office. ``I can't believe I've gotten what I've
gotten from these same little jokes I used to tell and get nowhere.''
   On his desk, under the gaze of a large, silk-screened image of
Elvis Presley, is a stack of paper scraps _ notes for an upcoming
``Update,'' jotted down whenever they strike him. He reads several
newspapers and magazines and watches newscasts each day.
   ``When I'm off, I'm a USA Today guy. I'm like anyone else, the
first thing I go for is the box scores,'' he said.
   ``But when I'm on, I read everything, I watch it during the week,
I try to keep up on jargon _ phrasing's important to a newscast. I
try to keep up on the lexicon of America.''
   Although pegged to the news, ``Weekend Update'' often becomes
Miller's stand-up act, only sitting down.
   ``It's obvious to everybody it's not a parody of a newscaster
anymore, it's Dennis just being Dennis at a news desk,'' he said.
   And what is ``being Dennis''?
   ``The overall tenor of it is low-key cynicism, non-threatening
cynicism,'' he said. ``I think there's a certain arrogance to it,
but I don't think it's off-putting.''
   The sneering attitude that fuels his humor is taken too
seriously, he said. When he said West Virginia ``makes Mayberry look
like a think-tank,'' the offended state was a random choice. ``It's
not as deep or as vindictive as people would tend to think,'' Miller
said.
   As for his fondness for obscure references, often to baby-boom
pop culture, he says, ``It's sometimes for the cognoscente, and I
don't need everyone to get it. I don't feel elitist about that, I
just write for me at some point.''
   Of course, he writes for others, as well, and he's clearly
pleased with the album and video.
   ``I was more than happy to get my act out there intact,'' he
said. ``It's like a childhood fantasy if you're a comedian. I
remember (the album) `Wonderfulness' and all the Cosby things, and
to think you have an album, it's a neat feeling.''

<TEXT>
   NBC's ``Miami Vice'' has thrived on style, and
executive producer Michael Mann is determined the detective series
will wrap up its fifth and final season the same way.
   ``For the final season, our writers are taking the mythology of
our best episodes seriously,'' said Mann. ``What we're trying to do
is write to that mythology. Our aim is to do a series of classic
`Vices.' The stories the writers are coming up with are on track.''
   What is that mythology?
   ``A hard-nosed attitude toward life,'' Mann replies. ``Yet, it's
not all grim and serious.''
   The decision to bring ``Miami Vice'' to an end wasn't lightly
made, but Mann and stars Don Johnson (playing Sonny Crockett) and
Philip Michael Thomas (Ricardo Tubbs) thought it was time to move
on. NBC has not officially acknowledged the decision to end the
series.
   ``It was by our election to end the show, so we're planning for
it,'' said Mann. ``As a result it's kind of liberating and has
generated a lot of enthusiasm. The show's going to be around a long
time in syndication and we all want it to end well. We're going to
end it with a two-hour episode. Salazar, a Latin American strong man
who can cut deals, will figure in that story.''
   The finale is still under wraps, but don't look for Sonny
Crockett to open a bait shop in the Keys and Ricardo Tubbs a charter
service in Bimini.
   The original concept of the show, which made its debut in
September 1984, was a kind of MTV cops. It pulsated with rock music
and vibrated with pastels. Its sparkling imagery came right out of a
music video.
   But this season, Sonny and Ricardo seem to wear only blacks and
grays, and the images seem to be filtered through sepia.
   Creator Anthony Yerkovich set the tone in the two-hour pilot
script, in which Sonny and Tubbs battled evil and corruption against
the backdrop of Florida's glitzy Gold Coast.
   The show was symbolized by the reflection of the neon and lights
in the black sheen of their Ferrari as they raced around Miami.
   Sonny Crockett was a vice detective whom Johnson played as a
knight errant in dented armor. He had a raspy voice, a three-day
beard, no socks and pastel Versace suits. His partner, Tubbs, played
by Thomas, was explained as a black New York street cop who first
came south to find the drug dealer who'd killed his brother. Edward
James Olmos played their taciturn boss, Lt. Martin Castillo.
   At the start of the fifth season, Sonny has been knocked cuckoo
and thinks he really is Sonny Burnett, his drug-dealing undercover
alter ego, and Mann is preparing for the windup. Sonny's brother
will show up this season and cause him trouble. A few loose ends
from various stories will also be taken care of.
   Although ``Miami Vice'' was rapped several years ago for
emphasizing style over content, Mann said he is now satisfied with
the scripts being turned out under the direction of Robert Ward. The
show got off the track when Mann temporarily left to direct
``Manhunter,'' based on Thomas Harris' suspense novel ``Red Dragon.''
   ``In the second season I went off to do the picture, and I
thought I had everything set up to function while I was gone,'' he
said. ``Forget about that. It was total meltdown. The first day of
shooting `Manhunter' I got a phone call from `Miami Vice.' All hell
had broken loose.
   ``There was no conscious attempt to rely on style. It's not in
the script. But once you set the style it becomes automatic. The art
director, costumers, editors all know what to look for. You don't
have to re-invent it every week. But you do have to re-invent the
story every week, and what we had was an absence of stories. The
style became more obvious because the story wasn't there.''
   After ``Miami Vice,'' Mann has a number of other projects lined
up. Among them is a six-hour miniseries for NBC based on Elaine
Shannon's ``Desperados.'' The book tells of Latin drug lords and the
murder of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency.

   This fall, Hutchinson County became the
52nd Texas county without a hospital when the town of Borger lost
Golden Plains Community Hospital, a 33-bed center brought down by
financial problems and a steadily declining number of patients.
   The decision to close was made by its outside owners, the
Atlanta-based Gateway Medical Systems Inc., and doctors and county
officials are trying to find a buyer.
   But in the meantime, residents of the rural Panhandle county must
drive at least 28 miles if they need anything fancier than stitches
or a cast for a broken bone.
   ``The doctors will meet patients in their offices to treat minor
emergencies,'' said Dr. Eduardo Coligardo, who was chief of staff at
Golden Plains. ``If it's a major emergency, we refer them to a major
hospital, usually in Amarillo (an hour away).''
   Just 100 miles to the southeast is the town of Memphis, a fifth
the size of Borger but recently the victor in a fight to keep Hall
County Hospital open and operating after predictions it would shut
in two months. Local people raised $366,000 in six weeks to buy new
equipment and recruit another doctor.
   Small community hospitals have become all but extinct in the
western and southwestern sections of Texas, home to about 400,000
people. In 1986 and 1987, Texas led the nation in hospital closings.
Twenty-four of the 32 hospitals that were shut were in rural areas.
   So far this year, 19 Texas hospitals have closed, 10 of them in
small towns and rural areas, according to the Texas Hospital
Association.
   Charles Bailey, THA vice president of legal affairs, said the
state's vastness is one simple reason for the high failure rate
among hospitals _ tiny rural hospitals can't afford to keep up with
the technology and expertise offered by the big medical centers in
the cities. Demand for rural hospital beds has dropped, below 20
percent in some cases, Bailey said, as urban hospitals advertise to
attract outlying patients.
   But more important is the ailing Texas economy.
   ``With businesses having trouble and some employees being laid
off and losing thir insurance, uncompensated care has increased in
the state, which puts strain on hospitals financially,'' he said.
   The worsening Texas economy has added to the indigent population;
hospitals provide more than $1.2 billion in uncompensated care each
year.
   While thousands of rural Texans are learning to live without the
protection of a nearby hospital, people in Hall County decided to
take a stand.
   In mid-September, an analysis team from an urban hospital
predicted the county hospital was failing and would fold by
Thanksgiving. It took just six weeks for residents to prove them
wrong.
   ``We realized we had to do something for ourselves, or we
wouldn't have a hospital,'' said Bill Cosby, a retired accountant.
   During the six-week fund drive, children emptied piggybanks,
citizens raffled off pickup trucks and sides of beef, and the
Memphis police chief used his radio to appeal to passing truckers
for donations.
   Almost two-thirds of the money raised was earmarked for new
equipment that would draw patients. Other funds went to recruitment
costs and salary for a new doctor to supplement the efforts of two
elderly physicians who serve the county's 5,000 residents, whose
average age is 57.
   The strong community support that characterized the fund-raising
effort should be enough to ensure the hospital's future survival,
but most communities aren't as lucky, said Dave Clark, regional
health care services coordinator for the Panhandle Health Care
Coalition.
   Hospitals will continue to close, although some may be able to
convert to clinics or emergency care centers.
   ``Some of these towns will just have to face the fact that they
won't have a hospital,'' he said. ``Their hospital may just be a
facility where a patient can be stabilized before taking the patient
on to a city hospital.''

<HEAD>Brazil is Most Hazardous Place to Drive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the beachfront Copacabana neighborhood
in Rio de Janeiro, drivers run red lights on an average of 50 times
an hour.
   Since becoming mayor of Sao Paulo in 1985, former President Janio
Quadros has personally given out more than 20,000 tickets for
traffic violations.
   Across this nation of 144 million people and 13 million motor
vehicles, 25,000 people are killed and 350,000 injured a year in
traffic accidents.
   So far as anyone here knows, that makes Brazil the world's most
hazardous place to drive _ or cross a street.
   About 47,000 people are killed annually in traffic in the United
States, but it has 177 million vehicles in a population of 242.2
million.
   Faced with highway carnage, Brazilian officials have started to
take serious steps to punish reckless drivers, including proposals
for increased jail sentences and stiff fines that in some cases can
exceed what a person earns in monthly wages.
   Reasons given for the carnage on Brazilian roadways include:
   _An inborn passion for moving fast.
   _Weak and ineffective traffic laws and enforcement.
   _National economic problems, such as 1,000 percent-plus annual
inflation that forces people to run around day and night to make
ends meet.
   ``We have a Vietnam in traffic every year,'' said Justice
Minister Paulo Brossard, in announcing a ``National Traffic Safety
Program'' proposing tougher treatment of bad drivers.
   ``It is civil war,'' said Jose Fernando Eichenberg, the No. 2
official in the ministry and a critic of weak traffic laws.
   Under the new program, traffic fines have gone up by as much as
300 percent. In some places a ticket for speeding or running a red
light costs the equivalent of $88, while parking in a prohibited
zone can go as high as $140. Brazil's montly minimum wage is about
$60.
   ``People are concerned with what hurts their pocketbooks,'' said
Cyro Vidal, the traffic director of Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city
and traffic-accident leader. ``It used to be cheaper to take a
ticket than pay for parking.''
   But Vidal added in an interview that Sao Paulo's 4 million annual
traffic fines _ equal to the number of cars in the city _ really
haven't reduced violations or accidents.
   Mayor Quadros routinely jumps out of his official car to hand out
tickets for traffic violations. For really gross infractions, he
calls a tow truck to haul away the violator's car. The mayor also
has placed the remains of smashed and twisted cars on special
platforms throughout the city, pinning signs to the wreckage that
read, ``Haste 1, Life 0.''
   But the wrecks continue anyway.
   Gov. Orestes Quercia of Sao Paulo state has outlawed the sale of
liquor at cafes and truck stops along state highways. But the news
media have reported that the law, the first of its kind in Brazil,
is being widely ignored.
   The head of the Traffic Department in Rio de Janeiro, Jose Alves
de Brito, said that in his city at least ``repression does not
achieve objectives.''
   ``Rio drivers are not civilized,'' he said, citing such
violations as chronic drunken driving, speeding, lack of respect for
traffic lights and signs, parking on sidewalks and even high-speed
zigzagging in tunnels.
   Brito said that because of Brazil's dismal economic situation,
with record inflation and the falling buying power of the cruzado,
the nation's currency, ``people need to earn more to maintain their
economic status and so must be on the go all day.''
   ``Accidents are a reflection of those problems,'' he said.
   Traffic authorities have some hopes for a plan to modify Brazil's
penal code to change traffic violations from simple misdemeanors to
felonious crimes. The plan proposes up to six months in jail for
reckless driving, a year in cases involving serious injuries and 18
months for a fatal accident.
   It also provides for mandatory driver education in high schools
and colleges and monthly upward readjustment of the amount of
traffic fines. The latter is aimed at violators who wait until the
end of the month to pay the fines and thus take advantage of the
daily devaluation of the cruzado.

   Old-timers with long memories
knew it was there. Archivists gave it a special place in the history
books. But millions of people passed by the wreckage without a clue
it was there.
   Then, in the summer of 1988, a woodcutter dropped a cigarette and
started a 450,000-acre forest fire that laid bare the bones of a
World War II-vintage B-17 bomber, 45 years after it went down on a
frigid spring night carrying 10 young airmen to their deaths.
   Besides blackening hundreds of thousands of acres in America's
first national park and triggering an uproar over firefighting
policy on public lands, the intense blazes in Yellowstone also
revealed some of its old secrets.
   ``The fires exposed a lot of old road cuts, torn up culverts and
bridges, and abandoned dump sites,'' said Tim Hudson, Yellowstone's
maintenance chief and a sanitary engineer. ``We vaguely knew about
all that stuff, but over the years trees had grown up around it and
it became hard to get to, too expensive to remove, or people forgot
about it.
   ``Our rehabilitation efforts following the fires have also given
us an opportunity to do some monumental cleanup of old junk because
we have the helicopters here to help us do it.''
   Besides rebuilding burned-out bridges, repairing bulldozed and
hand-cut firelines and fixing trails and public facilities, park
crews also raced the winter to remove all debris from the crash of
the B-17, tail No. 42-30260.
   Ground teams carefully collected the shattered, rusted pieces of
.50-caliber machine guns, splinters of practice bombs once filled
with sand and dozens of bullets.
   Much of the aluminum and steel already twisted by the crash was
charred from the North Fork fire. The weathered metal was loaded
into helicopter slings and hauled four miles north to a sorting area
inside the park near West Yellowstone, Mont.
   The main wreckage and the 20-foot crater created by the massive
bomber when it plowed into the ground around midnight May 23, 1943,
had been covered over by initial rescue crews, so Hudson's cleanup
team left it undisturbed.
   ``The stuff we pulled out totals about 25,000 pounds,'' said
Hudson. ``We flew all the bullets out first, then dumped and burned
their powder. The biggest piece we recovered was a wing tip. We also
found the vertical and horizontal stabilizer on the tail section a
mile from the main crash site.''
   Even the archivists had missed that one on their maps and charts
because, in the past half century, the forests of Yellowstone had
grown up around the site to create a living green shroud.
   Hardly any wreckage was recognizable. Park records indicate that
a few years after the crash a Yellowstone ranger salvaged enough
aluminum to make a snow plane, forerunner of the snowmobile. The
area also showed signs of earlier scavenging and looting. Nothing
recovered this fall was deemed usable, so the park service, with
Department of Defense approval, will sell it as scrap to the highest
bidder.
   Poking through the forest fire's ashes, park employees also found
small reminders of the airmen who died.
   ``We found part of a leather jacket, a shoe, some pieces of belts
and rings off of parachute harnesses,'' said Dick Bahr,
Yellowstone's air operations supervisor. ``There was no identifying
markings on any of the personal gear so we sent it to a mortuary to
be incinerated.''
   It was precious little to commemorate the burial ground of an
airplane once hailed as ``The Queen of the Skies'' and singled out
by the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum as the most powerful weapon
in the war against Hitler's Germany.
   In 1983, park service historical archivist Andy Beck collected
every scrap of information he could find about aircraft No. 42-30260
and compiled it in a plastic ringbinder now kept at Yellowstone
headquarters.
   The plane, with 11 men on board, was flying from Marysville,
Calif., to its home base at Lewiston, Mont. According to an Army Air
Corps investigation, the pilot climbed to 15,000 feet above Reno,
Nev., and soon hit rough air. He was flying by instruments.
   Next to the line citing ``Nature of Accident'' was this notation:
``Airplane encountered icing conditions. No definite knowledge of
what happened.''
   Retired Yellowstone Park Ranger Tom Ela never knew the cause but
he remembers the crash well.
   ``My wife, Betty, and I'd been to a birthday party and had just
gotten home when we heard the plane go over. I went to the window
because I knew it wasn't sounding right. We could hear it go into a
scream as it went down.''
   Ela rushed to a nearby observation plateau and saw the sky alight
with flame. The plane, carrying live ammunition, burned on impact.
   There was confusion about the number of men aboard, so Ela was
among searchers looking for survivors. On the third day, when he
clibed a tree and hollered ``Hallooooo'' for the hundredth time, an
answering call came back.
   ``He said his name was McDonald, he was very, very cold, and he
asked `Where am I?' because he had no idea,'' recalled Ela, who now
lives in Santa Fe, N.M.
   ``When I told him he was in Yellowstone National Park he couldn't
believe it. He told me he'd been sleeping right by the hatch with
his parachute on. Apparently he'd had a tight squeak before on a
flight and he was the only one in the crew who had his 'chute on.
   ``When he heard in his headphones `THIS IS IT! THIS IS IT! GET
OUT!' he just rolled out the hatch and pulled the cord. He saw the
plane crash below him and knew he'd made it but didn't know if
anybody else did. That was bothering him a lot.''
   McDonald told Ela that later, as he'd wandered alone in the woods
for two days, he'd wondered if he'd had a nightmare and bailed out
by mistake as his plane flew on to its home base.
   The Army Air Corps listed Lt. William McDonald, bombardier, as
the only survivor. After leading McDonald out of the woods, Ela
helped pack out on horseback the dead men and the plane's top secret
equipment.
   The official investigation concludes that 2,000 square feet of
Yellowstone were damaged, the aircraft was totally destroyed, and
the pilot (no signature available, deceased) absolved the park
service of any blame.
   Hudson, Bahr, and other park employees agreed that working on the
B-17 cleanup had been an interesting chapter in the story of the
Yellowstone fires. Next summer they hope to tackle an even bigger
rehabilitation project.
   ``There's a B-47 bomber still out there in an area that didn't
burn,'' said Hudson. ``It crashed in 1963, killing four Air Force
crewmen, without any fire or explosion. We estimate its wreckage at
85,000 pounds. If we can get the big helicopters back in here next
summer that ought to keep us busy.''

<HEAD>Record Numbers of Hospitals Are Closing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some facts about hospitals and health care provided by
the American Hospital Association, the National Rural Health
Association, the National Hospital Panel Survey, the Texas Hospital
Association and a survey conducted by the Touche Ross accounting and
management consulting firm:
   
   Closings:
   In 1987, 79 community hospitals closed in 30 states: 35 for
profit, 30 non-profit and 14 owned and operated by the government.
   Of those closed, 17 were in Texas, eight others in Arkansas,
Oklahoma and Louisiana.
   Most hospitals that closed had 25-99 beds.
   Seventeen non-community hospitals in 13 states also shut down
last year. They generally provide specialty care, such as
rehabilitative or psychiatric treatment.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Finances:
   Half of all urban hospitals operated in the red in 1987; nearly
seven of 10 rural hospitals lost money.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Location:
   In 1986, more than 46 percent of the nation's community hospitals
were in rural areas. Of the 2,638 rural hospitals, 71 percent had
fewer than 100 beds.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Medicare:
   The price of goods and services purchased by hospitals from 1984
to 1988 rose 22 percent, while the amount Medicare pays to hospitals
increased just 11 percent.
   A 1988 survey of 1,400 hospital executives found that 48 percent
think reduced Medicare reimbursements may force their hospitals to
shut in the next five years.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Hospitalization:
   About 33.6 million people were hospitalized in 1987, an 11
percent drop since 1982.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Age (related to Medicare funding): In 1986, those 65 years and
older accounted for 14 percent of the rural population and 11
percent of the urban population.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Poverty (related to Medicaid funding): In 1985, 17.6 percent of
the rural elderly lived in poverty, compared with 10.9 percent of
the urban elderly.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Losses: Adjusted to reflect actual expenses, hospitals nationwide
lost $2.8 billion in 1980 caring for indigent patients. In 1986, it
was $7 billion.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   States: Texas led the nation in hospital closings in 1986 and
1987 and will probably continue to lead this year. Since 1984, 68
hospitals have closed; 35 of them in rural areas.
   Fifty-two of Texas' 254 counties now have no hospitals.

   Before leaving for work, Aliza
Herbst packed sandwiches for her five children and drank a cup of
coffee with her husband.
   Then she slipped a pistol into her purse.
   ``Irrational violence has made us fearful,'' explained Mrs.
Herbst, 36, an immigrant from San Antonio. ``But we're the kind of
people who will put our bodies and lives on the line for what we
believe in.''
   Nearly a year of Palestinian rebellion has prompted many Jewish
settlers in the occupied West Bank to make pistols or automatic
rifles a part of their daily lives.
   Mrs. Herbst and her husband, Gershon, moved to this tight-knit
West Bank community 13 years ago because they wanted to put down
roots in a place where crime was virtually non-existent and
neighbors shared basic religious values.
   But Ofra, like the 118 other Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
has been thrust into the midst of the Palestinian uprising in which
settlers have become targets of roadside ambushes and rock-throwing
protests.
   The American-born couple still describes the settlement, with its
lawns and rows of identical orange-roofed houses, as a community in
which ``kids can wander free and you don't have to lock your front
door.''
   But the the violence surrounding Ofra's 760 residents echoes at
the Herbst family's dinner table and in its living room.
   On one recent Jewish Sabbath, the youngest children played on the
bare tile floors in the family home before joining their parents in
prayers, songs and Friday night dinner.
   After the meal, 10-year-old Yehuda brought a tattered Palestinian
flag into the kitchen.
   ``I will give it to them, then kill them,'' he boasted to a young
friend while clutching the red, white, green and black banner.
   His parents cast disapproving looks across the table, explaining
later that teaching the children to deal with anger is one of the
challenges of raising a family in the midst of the uprising.
   ``I don't want my kids going around being hateful,'' said Herbst,
a native of Brooklyn, N.Y. ``We always take time to talk to them
about the situation. They know people get hurt and they have to
express their fears.''
   Traveling beyond the settlement's perimeter has become risky.
   Herbst, a partner in a farm cooperative, carries an M-16 assault
rifle on trips to his fruit orchard which is near Jerusalem, 15
miles south of Ofra.
   ``It's not an over-reaction to shoot. I'd rather deal with the
judicial system than the hospital system,'' Herbst explained as he
drove along unlighted West Bank roads on a Saturday night with the
rifle at his side.
   According to Law in the Service of Man, an Arab-run human rights
group, Jewish settlers have killed 12 of the 315 Palestinians who
have died since last December as a result of the violence. Five
Israeli civilians have been killed in the occupied lands.
   One victim of Palestinian attacks was Meshulam Moscowitz, a
neighbor of the Herbsts' who is still recovering from a head wound
suffered in a stone-throwing Arab ambush eight months ago. Doctors
implanted a plastic plate to repair his damaged skull.
   Now Moscowitz wears a bicycle helmet and carries an automatic
rifle when he travels beyond the line of olive trees that separates
Ofra from the neighboring Arab village of Ein Yabrud.
   ``I don't want it to happen again,'' said the New York-born
Moscowitz, who taught self-defense courses to the settlement's
children before the attack. ``But I'm not going to leave now and
show them that throwing stones works.''

<TEXT>
   Finally, with the Christmas
season hard upon a wintry land, the fires have gone out in
Yellowstone National Park.
   It has been half a year since lightning hit a tree near Rose
Creek on May 24 and ignited the first of 20 wildfires in the 2.2
million-acre park.
   That blaze died on its own. But others, christened Hellroaring
and Storm Creek, Clover and Mist and Huck, roared up from smoldering
embers to engulf nearly half of the first national park in walls of
flame that eventually stretched 20 miles wide and 40 miles long on
two fronts.
   The firestorms of Yellowstone were awesome and frightening.
Despite the efforts of 25,000 firefighters, only the natural forces
of snow and rain were a match for the fires' fury.
   By mid-November, the firefighters were gone and the remnants of
flame no longer demanded constant attention. As inches, then feet of
snow fell on the park tucked into the corner where Wyoming, Idaho,
and Montana meet, park officials officially declared the
conflagration over Nov. 18.
   After six months of trying to fight fires, patch together
disrupted services and keep the park gates open, Yellowstone
officials at last had a chance to assess damage and prepare for the
future.
   They have already asked Congress for $21.3 million toward fire
recovery, including elaborate exhibits, books, traveling information
teams and extensive research. Of that money, $10 million would be
used to repair actual fire damage.
   ``We lost 100 power poles and 18 miles of line, which amounted to
about 40,000 pounds of copper wire,'' said Tim Hudson, Yellowstone's
maintenance chief. ``At one time we were running 13 generators and
using 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel a day just to keep this park
operating. We didn't get full power restored until October.
   ``About 200 miles of roadside terrain needs to be rehabilitated
by taking down all the burned trees _ the snags _ which threaten to
fall on the highway. Lord knows how many need to be pulled down
along the hiking and ski trails. Then we have to cut the stumps down
to ground level and grind up their tops, spread wood chips out, and
cover them with soil so they'll decompose.''
   ``We had 32 miles of bulldozer line, but we got that fixed. About
1,000 miles of hand-cut fire lines still have to be repaired. On one
trail alone we've got to replace seven pedestrian bridges. We've got
to clean up and aerate the soil at more than 150 helicopter landing
sites. All the back-country campsites used by fire crews also have
to be rehabbed.''
   Hudson is a straightforward manager whose vanity is a handlebar
mustache that makes him look like the villain who tied Pauline to
the railroad tracks. He was an unheralded hero of Yellowstone's
summer of smoke as he organized his beleagered maintenance crews to
rush from one disaster to another.
   They set up miles of sprinkler pipe at Old Faithful and Canyon
Village, saved 26 backcountry cabins with a jury-rigged system of
hoses strung from tiny creeks, and frantically wrapped an enormous
steel water tank in fiberglass insulation that burned off but saved
the tank.
   Generally, Hudson's staff held the entire park's infrastructure
together with ingenuity, improvisation and, as Hudson put it, ``a
lot of luck.''
   ``At some point I knew it would end. I just never thought it
would go on so long,'' said Hudson, who took six days off in the
five months of the worst strain. ``I also knew that when it did
ultimately end, we'd be stuck with the leftover mess.''
   Of the request for funds now with Congress, Hudson asked for
$90,000 to rehabilitate bulldozer lines, $1.5 million for electrical
services, $1 million to groom highway corridors, another $1 million
to upgrade 600 miles of hiking trails and $15,000 to rebuild a
burned-out bathroom.
   Decades of forgotten debris camouflaged by growing trees was
exposed by the fires, so rehabilitation crews also targeted for
cleanup piles of tin cans, old culverts, abandoned campsites and
even the wreckage of a B-17 bomber that crashed in 1943.
   Immediately after the worst of the fires were contained, park
officials offered free firewood along the roadside to anybody who
wanted it. Hudson estimated several thousand cords of charred fuel
went to the public. He also negotiated a contract with a Livingston,
Mont., lumber company to pay the park $25 for every 1,000 cubic feet
of snag trees it hauled away. That project is expected to last well
into next summer.
   Never without his walkie-talkie, Hudson prowled Yellowstone's
roads supervising crews trying to clean up the ``leftover mess''
until snow closed most of the highways. It's his responsibility to
get the park in shape for next summer's tourist season.
   Lore Williams is one of Hudson's assistants. As Yellowstone's
landscape architect, Ms. Williams, 33, was criticized at the height
of the blazes for resisting the use of bulldozers and heavy
equipment to build fire breaks inside the park.
   ``I felt the heat both literally and figuratively,'' Ms. Williams
said wryly, acknowledging her role in helping direct a firefighting
strategy that is to be reviewed by Congress amid outcries about
mismanagement.
   ``From the beginning we assigned resource people to work on every
fire to brief crews on how to cut hand line in a serpentine way so
it wouldn't be so hard to rehabilitate it,'' said Ms. Williams, a
park employee for four years. ``When they put that bulldozer line
in, it was overrun six hours later. We knew it wouldn't hold.
   ``It took an operater 325 hours on a rubber-tired excavator, plus
20-man crews using hand tools for several weeks, to fix it. Now I'm
worried that poachers will use the new 'dozer roads in the back
country. ''
   Ms. Williams is frustrated by the amount of human-caused damage
left behind by the thousands of firefighters who camped for months
in Yellowstone.
   ``Our top priority was hauling out trash and food that could
attract bears,'' she said. ``We worked our tails off to get the
bulldozer firebreak rehabbed before winter, but we've got a long way
to go on the hand line. A 20-person crew can only rehabilitate two
miles of hand line a day.''
   Ms. Williams supervised eight crews this fall and hopes to have a
similar number back on the job next spring if there's enough money.
Each crew includes seven sawyers certified to use chain saws, two
fallers approved to bring down trees, one emergeny medical
technician, and at least two squad bosses.
   ``It's filthy, unglamorous work in the cold, wind and ash,'' said
Ms. Williams, who spent part of every day supervising from a
helicopter, ``but we are trying to work with the natural scene. We
are trying to heal the scars.''

<HEAD>Steelmaker's $2.26 Billion Charge Reflects Giant Problem for Many
Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When LTV Corp. announced a $1.24 billion
third-quarter loss, the news passed almost routinely, largely
because the troubled aerospace-steelmaker has been under bankruptcy
court protection for more than two years, struggling to find a
formula to cut expenses and pay creditors.
   But buried in LTV's quarterly financial statement released this
past week was an explosive accounting charge that grabbed the
attention of many publicly owned companies that could face similar
balance-sheet shockers in the next few years.
   LTV said it was putting $2.26 billion aside for what the company
anticipates will be its potential liability in health insurance
costs of 118,000 current and retired employees.
   Under present accounting rules, companies aren't obligated to
report these estimated expenses or reserve money for them. They only
have to report retiree health insurance costs as they are incurred,
on what is known as a ``pay as you go'' basis.
   But the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
government-sanctioned authority for accountants, is planning to
propose a new rule in January that would require companies to show
all retiree health insurance costs _ those incurred now and expected
in the future _ as a liability.
   With medical costs soaring at an average rate of 20 percent a
year, the potential liability of U.S. corporations is staggering,
with nothing in place to offset the expense.
   The Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit organization
in Washington, has estimated that non-governmental employers owe at
least $168.7 billion in retiree health benefits, assuming medical
inflation eventually is brought under control.
   More pessimistic forecasts put the potential liability at $2
trillion to $3 trillion, said Deborah Shollet, an institute official.
   None of this liability shows up in quarterly earnings statements
or annual reports to shareholders, as though it doesn't exist. That
is the main reason why the accounting rule change was proposed.
   ``These are big benefits; they represent big obligations,'' said
Michael Johnston, a partner at Hewitt Associates, a Chicago-based
benefit consulting concern that has been advising clients on the
implications of the rule change. He said many corporate accountants
are concerned.
   ``I think most companies are going to fight tooth and nail
against this type of thing,'' Johnston said. ``It's accounting for
future inflation, long before inflation comes into play, and it's
going to have such a big hit on earnings, so most corporations have
to argue against it.''
   Many accounting experts saw LTV's move to anticipate the expense
now as part of its bankruptcy-court housecleaning, and some believed
other companies would wait for the new accounting rule before doing
anything.
   ``If you're trying to come out of bankruptcy and come out
starting fresh, you don't want to do it with a $2.26 billion
liability,'' said Diana Scott, project manager of the Financial
Accounting Standard Board's change on post-employment benefits, who
is helping draft the new rule.
   She said companies will have an opportunity to comment on the
rule after the board promulgates a draft in January. Public hearings
would follow and a final rule is expected in 1990.
   ``Almost everybody will acknowledge there's a liability and it
should be recorded. The question is how to record it,'' Ms. Scott
said.
   The uncertainty raised by the accounting board's intentions, as
dramatized by the LTV action, is likely to at least force some
companies to start making contingency plans, benefit consultants say.
   A few already are looking closely at how to minimize their
retiree health insurance exposure by restricting the amount of money
they contribute or even eliminating such benefits entirely.
   Such cutbacks could affect millions of employees. Hewitt
Associates has calculated that 86 percent of the 800 biggest
companies provide medical coverage after age 65 and 92 percent
provide it before age 65.
   ``It will be impossible for employers to provide the same
benefits they've been providing,'' said Richard S. Raskin, a New
York-based consultant with the Wyatt Co., a large
compensation-benefits consulting firm.
   ``I think the trend is to take a look at what the promise to
employees is, and make it limited and manageable,'' he said. ``It's
no longer a case of, `we're going to provide you with all sorts of
medical benefits.'''
   Some experts speculated that large, mature industries with huge
retiree populations, such as the steelmakers, automakers and
utilities, will have the hardest time under the new rule. Vibrant
young businesses with relatively few retirees won't feel the impact
for a while.
   Nevertheless, all companies with retiree health plans could be
equally affected as the baby-boom work force matures into retirement
age early next century and the cost of such benefits escalates.
   Ms. Scott said the accounting standards board has been working on
the proposed rule for a few years and realizes the enormous
pressures it could create on corporate America's finances. For that
reason, she said, such a change would likely be phased in over a
period of years.
   ``We have this tremendous unfunded obligation right now,'' she
said. ``To put that on the balance sheet would just be onerous. We
recognize that.''

   Wall Streeters are bracing for what might be a
long winter waiting for the first skirmishes in the battle of the
budget between George Bush and Congress.
   Most handicappers in the financial world say the odds are not
good that the president-elect will be able to get much cooperation
from the Democratic-controlled Congress on measures to deal with the
federal budget deficit.
   Even if a constructive mood should develop, most analysts agree,
the new administration will start out burdened with a heavy load of
problems, and no clear mandate from the voters on what to do about
them.
   And while such worries have become a dominant force in the
thinking of many investors, there is still nearly two months to go
before Bush even takes office.
   ``George Bush has inherited some serious problems,'' say analysts
at Wright Investors' Service in Bridgeport, Conn.
   ``The takeover activity that pushed stock prices so high these
past five years represents a significant risk should recession or
high interest rates turn the leveraged buyout debt bad.
   ``The deficit spending that helped propel the U.S. economy to the
longest peacetime expansion in history cannot be counted on forever.
   ``There is a limit to the debt which the U.S. economy can
support, and the dollar's recent weakness suggests we are close to
that limit.
   Yet, the Wright analysts say, ``Bush's mandate does not appear to
extend beyond maintaining the status quo.
   ``Congress may not allow President Bush a graceful way out of his
`Read my lips _ no new taxes' pledge, and may not support his
`flexible freeze' on government spending.''
   Byrle Abbin, a tax partner in Washington with the accounting firm
of Arthur Andersen & Co., says the new president and Congress are
likely to find themselves playing a ``game of chicken,'' leaving
budget matters to be resolved in a last-minute, crisis atmosphere.
   Stock prices, which had been slumping since the election early
this month, managed to show signs of steadying in the past week. But
trading was quiet and by all accounts uninspired.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.27 to 2,074.68.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index edged up .45 to
150.63; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
lost 1.20 to 366.38, while the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 4.52 at 291.19.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 107.88 million shares a day,
down from 136.08 million the week before.
   Financial analysts say Bush's campaign vow against increasing
taxes, while it may have helped him win the election, may hinder him
in his dealings with Congress by fostering an adversary atmosphere.
   ``The `flexible freeze,' which limits spending increases to the
rate of inflation, will also be very hard to attain,'' declared
Harold Nathan at the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.
   ``It would require big cuts in defense spending, which Bush does
not, so far, want.
   ``Adding to the problem of reducing the deficit is the
president-elect's preferences for reducing the capital gains tax and
for increasing spending on education and child care.
   ``In addition,'' said Nathan, ``the optimistic forecasts for
balancing the budget by 1993 assume rapid economic growth and low
interest rates. A recession between now and 1993 would set back the
timetable extensively.
   ``So it is no wonder that the post-election focus on the deficit
reduction process weakened the dollar significantly.''

   Congressional Democrats have questioned the
fairness of a Federal Communications Commission proposal to replace
profit regulation of telephone companies with caps on prices.
   A report by the Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee said Wednesday the FCC's proposal
fails to assure that rates for regulated phone service will be
``just and reasonable.'' The FCC has proposed to change the way it
regulates American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and the regional Bell
phone companies by lifting limits on the profits they can earn and
instead set a ceiling on rates.

   The dollar was slightly higher against most major
currencies in thin morning trading today with the market waiting for
a cue from New York after the Thanksgiving holiday.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Traders said the dollar moved higher following an estimated $200
million of buying by Japan's central Bank of Japan in East Asian
markets earlier today.
   The dollar ran into some resistance early in Europe at around
1.7180 West German marks, but most traders said they were waiting
for the opening of the U.S. market after the holiday Thursday.
   ``The market wants to see where New York would take the dollar,''
said one trader at a European bank in Frankfurt.
   In Tokyo, where markets close before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 121.15 yen, unchanged from Thursday.
Later in London it traded higher at 121.25 yen.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. One pound
cost $1.8353, cheaper for buyers than Thursday's late $1.8375.
   Other midmorning dollar rates, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.7180 West German marks, up from 1.7135; 1.4390
Swiss francs, up from 1.4375; 5.8715 French francs, up from 5.8585;
1.9375 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9340; 1,276.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,273.75; 1.1905 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1960.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $420.20 a troy ounce and
at midmorning the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $422.60. Both prices were higher than
Thursday's late bid price of $420.
   Gold was trading in Zurich at a bid price of $422.80, up from
Thursday's late price of $420.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $3.39 to close at a bid price of $424.55
today.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid $6.14 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Thursday.

   After trading lower throughout the day, the dollar
recovered slightly to close unchanged against the Japanese yen in
the Tokyo foreign exchange market today. Share prices were
moderately higher.
   The dollar closed at 121.15 yen, unchanged from Thursday's close,
after opening lower at 120.88 yen. It was the first time since Jan.
4 that the dollar opened below the 121-yen level.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 66.62
points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 29,406.65. The market's main
index lost 90.09 points Thursday after rising for eight consecutive
trading days.
   After declining in London overnight, the dollar traded in the
relatively wide range of 120.67 yen to 121.20 yen before settling at
121.15 yen.
   Central bank intervention, along with bullish comments by Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, first helped to slow and eventually to
stop the dollar's fall. Dealers estimated the bank's dollar
purchases today at 300 to 400 million yen.
   Dealers said Japan's central bank actively intervened before
Tokyo trading began, buying dollars in the Sydney market.
   ``The Bank of Japan is changing its intervention style'' by
entering the market early, said Kaneo Ogino, a dealer at Goldman
Sachs in Tokyo. ``They've been asking prices and are going to buy.''
   Ogino said the central bank also appeared to be active in the
Singapore market after the Tokyo market had closed. Bank of Japan
officials refuse to comment on their market activities.
   Sentiment toward the dollar remained bearish, traders said. But
speculation that a new Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
production agreement could be reached in the next few days could
help prop up the dollar during European trading, said Stephen
Codrington, head of equity sales at Jardine Fleming (Securities)
Ltd. here.
   On Thursday, Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh announced
that he agreed in principle to a new OPEC agreement, which raises
the cartel's production ceiling to 18.5 million barrels a day.
   In the stock market, prices were firmer until midafternoon, when
investors sold utilities on speculation over the OPEC announcement,
Codrington said.
   But the market recovered to close higher after a late rally.
   ``There was some window dressing by investment trusts, and today
was the last day of trading for November accounts, so some dealers
were squaring positions,'' he added.
   Analysts said the financial markets were relatively quiet due to
the Thanksgiving holidays, and that brokers were reluctant to make
major changes in their positions. Japanese markets were closed on
Labor Thanksgiving Day Wednesday, and U.S. financial institutions
closed for Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
   Japan's finance minister told reporters today that Japan is ready
to intervene in the currency market to stem exchange rate volatility.
   He also said that fluctuations in the currency exchange markets
had not created a need for a meeting of the Group of Seven major
industrial nations. The comment followed calls for a G-7 meeting
after president-elect George Bush's inauguration from West German
Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and his French counterpart,
Pierre Beregovoy.

   The Farmers Home Administration is mailing out
today the last of 83,480 delinquency notices to farmers who owe more
than $8 billion in past-due government loans.
   Agency officials began sending out the notices by certified mail
on Nov. 15 telling FmHA borrowers they have 45 days to complete and
return the nine forms. Basically, the notices tell farmers about the
options they have for settling their debt, including restructuring
and write-offs.
   Congress ordered FmHA in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to
revise its lending practices, including ways to handle long-overdue
debt owed by thousands of farmers. Parts of the law were put into
effect earlier in the year but debt write-down, or forgiveness,
kicked in this month.
   The purpose of the notices is to give delinquent borrowers an
opportunity to let FmHA know how they want to handle their debt
under the new law's provisions.
   Leland H. Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union,
explained: ``The new law basically says FmHA must give borrowers
whose delinquency was caused by factors beyond their control 45 days
to convince the agency that it could recover more by working with
them than it could by forcing them out.''
   Swenson added: ``Clearly, the law puts the burden on borrowers to
prepare their financial arguments quickly and thoroughly.''
   If a farmer's response, or application, to FmHA on how he plans
to settle the debt is accepted by the agency, the chances of
survival are brightened. But if a borrower's plan is rejected _ or
if a reply is not sent at all _ then foreclosure or forced sale of
property is likely.
   Although agency spokesmen say no hard estimates are available as
to how many of the 83,480 delinquents may be foreclosed or forced to
sell out, estimates have ranged from around 10,000 to more than
40,000.
   Vance L. Clark, FmHA administrator, has said that eventually up
to 30,000 borrowers could face foreclosure.
   Clark resigned his job earlier this week, according to FmHA
spokesmen. He had previously indicated leaving around Dec. 1. Sox
Johnson, acting associate administrator, took over the job.
   No official announcement was made of Clark's departure, although
a farewell party was held in USDA on Tuesday afternoon.
   Clark, who spent 42 years with the Bank of America before taking
over FmHA more than three years ago, bristled at accusations the
agency's notices or program are unfair.
   ``If anything, I tell my people we're getting ready to jump start
thousands of American farmers out there,'' Clark said recently in
Des Moines at a bankers' meeting. ``The good news is that the relief
measure is being offered. I think it's going to play well.''
   But there is some pressure on FmHA to extend the 45-day period
for borrowers to return their financial forms, including a request
from 14 members of Congress.
   Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., one of the petitioners, said he was
concerned that borrowers may not be able to get all the information
and assistance they need before Jan. 1, because many banks and
offices may be closed several days for the holidays.
   ``These notices include over 200 pages of complex regulations,''
Dorgan said. ``I feel that farmers should be given sufficient time
to analyze the regulations and compile the necessary information to
fill out the forms correctly.''

   Panic buying has forced 19 provinces and cities to
impose rationing on salt, the manager of the China National Salt Co.
was quoted today as saying.
   The official China Daily quoted Zhang Tiecheng as saying
rationing of table salt went into effect this month and will not end
until the shortage has eased.
   Zhang said the company stopped wholesale salt supplies to
enterprises and individuals, limiting supplies to retail outlets in
an effort to stop hoarding and panic buying.
   The daily quoted another salt company official as saying table
salt supplies had been stable for more than 30 years but that salt
output will reach a record 20 million tons this year, up 3 million
tons from last year.
   He was quoted as saying the shortage resulted from a rapid
increase in salt consumption by the chemical industry and panic
buying in 26 cities and regions.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Tennessee Anti-Takeover Laws Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that
Tennessee's anti-takeover laws are unconstitutional and cannot be
used to stop Tyson Foods Inc.'s bid to buy out Holly Farms Corp.
   ``These acts violate the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution
to the extent they apply to target corporations organized under the
laws of states other than Tennessee,'' U.S. District Judge Thomas A.
Wiseman wrote in a memorandum.
   Wiseman on Wednesday enjoined the state from enforcing the laws
to prevent a takeover of Holly Farms.
   Tyson of Springdale, Ark., the nation's largest poultry producer,
last month made a $52-per-share takeover offer for the Memphis-based
food producer. It has extended the offer until mid-December.
   Holly Farms has rejected Tyson's bids and struck up a deal to
merge with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb., through a stock swap.
ConAgra is the fifth-largest poultry processor in the nation.
   Wednesday's ruling came just days after Tyson sued Holly Farms
and ConAgra in chancery court in Wilmington, Del., where the three
companies were chartered.
   The suit, filed Monday, seeks to invalidate the proposed Holly
Farms-ConAgra merger as well as an option the Holly Farms board
granted to ConAgra allowing the Nebraska producer to purchase Holly
Farms' top poultry assets in the event the merger fails.
   Wiseman said Tennessee's laws violate the commerce clause because
they regulate interstate commerce, risk inconsistent regulation and
place an excessive burden on interstate commerce in relation to
local benefits.
   The state laws passed March 11 include the Investor Protection
Act, which regulates takeover offers for corporations that are
incorporated or have principal offices in Tennessee and substantial
assets in the state.
   The other three laws require an investor to wait five years or
more after acquiring 10 percent of a company's stock to make a
takeover offer, strip voting rights from a potential buyer and
regulate corporations not incorporated in Tennessee.
   State Attorney General Charles Burson said he had not yet decided
whether to appeal Wiseman's decision.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit More Than Doubles, Prompting Interest Rate Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit more than
doubled to 2.93 billion pounds, or about $5.4 billion, in October as
exports fell sharply and imports surged, the government announced
Friday.
   The Bank of England pushed up interest rates a full percentage
point to 13 percent half an hour after the trade report was released
at 11:30 a.m. The rate increase, the first since a full-point hike
on Aug. 25, steadied a plummeting pound, but sent stock prices
plunging.
   The increase underscores the government's determination to ``take
no risks'' with inflation, said a Treasury official, who wasn't
identified in accordance with British practice. The benchmark rate
has been pushed up 5.5 points since June.
   Britain's major commercial banks quickly responded to the central
banks' signal, with Barclays Bank PLC, National Westminster Bank
PLC, and Lloyds Banks PLC increasing their benchmark rate.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said on British
Broadcasting Corp. television that the worsening October figures
should be viewed together with good figures in the previous month,
adding ``interest rates do take time to take their full effect.''
   Lawson has said repeatedly that interest rates would have to rise
further if the nation's economy continued to move at too fast a rate.
   The British pound dropped from about $1.8335 to $1.8220 on the
trade news but it bounced back to $1.8370 on the rate increase.
   But developments sent the Financial Times Stock Exchange
100-share index tumbling 41.1 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,791.9 at
about 1 p.m., its worst level for the day. Moments before the trade
report, the index was down just 1.1 points.
   The seasonally adjusted deficit in October, which the government
blamed partly on erratic items and distortions caused by a September
mail strike, compared with a revised deficit of 1.09 billion pounds,
or $2 billion, in September and of 954 million pounds, or $1.8
billion, in October 1987.
   Exports fell 10 percent in October while imports gained 12
percent, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   With October's trade in invisible items _ which covers services,
overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments _
estimated to be in surplus by 500 million pounds, or $920 million,
Britain's current account showed a record deficit of 2.43 billion
pounds ($4.5 billion) in October, compared with a revised deficit of
594 million pounds ($1.09 billion) in September and a deficit of 491
million pounds ($903 million) in October 1987.
   The department said the September postal dispute affected the
recording of exports, but not imports. As much as 300 million pounds
of exports ($552 million) that were allocated to September should
have been allocated to October, it said.
   The department also said that October's imports included around
400 million pounds ($736 million) in erratic items, such as precious
stones and aircraft.
   Since the beginning of 1988, Britain's merchandise trade balance
has been in deficit by 17 billion pounds ($31 billion), compared
with a deficit of 7.8 billion pounds ($14 billion) in the same
period a year earlier.
   The current account has been in deficit by 12.4 billion pounds
($23 billion) so far this year, compared with a deficit of 1.1
billion pounds ($2 billion) a year earlier.

   Stock prices tumbled in light post-Thanksgiving
Day trading today, depressed by expectations of higher oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 20.09 to 2,072.19
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 228 up, 688 down and
370 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.30 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The session after Thanksgiving is usually one of the quietest

   This time, however, those traders who were present were faced
with the news of a tentative agreement by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on production quotas
aimed at shoring up oil prices.
   The prospect of increased energy costs weighed down the credit
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell nearly $10 for each
$1,000 in face value this morning.
   The stock market followed suit, with the notable exception of
energy stocks.
   In the energy sector, Atlantic Richfield rose 1[ to 79[; Exxon ]

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ask Wall Streeters why they are so worried about
the economic outlook right now, and chances are they will point to
the so-called yield curve.
   If this statistical measure keeps going the way it has been
headed lately, a good many analysts say, it could signal trouble
ahead for both the business outlook and the stock market.
   The yield curve depicts the relationship between short-term and
long-term interest rates.
   Most of the time, it stands to reason that long-term rates should
be significantly higher than short-term rates, since long-term
lenders expose themselves to greater risks.
   You might be highly confident of a borrower's ability to repay
six months from now, but much less sure of its prospective status 20
or 30 years in the future.
   Similarly, you might not worry much about inflation eroding the
purchasing power of your principal between today and next summer.
But who knows what a dollar will buy two or three decades down the
road?
   In the real world, however, the relationship of short and long
interest rates is constantly fluctuating. When long rates are
significantly higher than short, the curve depicting them is said to
have a positive slope.
   Since early this year, by contrast, the yield curve has been
flattening. While long-term rates have risen overall, short-term
rates have been climbing faster.
   By one measure, using short-term commercial paper issued by
businesses and top-grade corporate bonds, the yield spread has
lately grown narrower than at any time since 1981, observed Martin
Zweig in his advisory letter Zweig Forecast.
   ``At least the spread between long and short rates is not
negative,'' Zweig said. ``When that is true (an inverted yield
curve), it tends to be poison for stocks.''
   Why should a seemingly arcane statistic cause such a fuss? ``A
flattening or inversion of the yield curve is often associated with
a recession,'' said Jack Lavery, research chief at Merrill Lynch.
   ``The link between inverted yield curves and recessions comes
from underlying imbalances.
   ``A rise in short-term rates usually occurs because the Federal
Reserve tightens monetary policy when inflation pressures start to
build during the mature stages of a business cycle. Speculative
inventory building adds to pressure on short-term rates.''
   High short-term rates, in turn, act as a brake on economic
activity.
   The last three times short-term rates went higher than long rates
_ in 1969, 1973 and 1980-81 _ the stock market took a beating and
the economy headed into recession.
   ``Only once during the past 30 years has an inversion in the
curve not been followed by a recession,'' Lavery said. ``The
exception was in 1966, when slower growth, but not a recession,
followed.''
   Lavery notes that the forces flattening the yield curve this time
seem to differ from past instances. For one thing, he says, business
inventories are not building up to extreme levels.
   But the Federal Reserve has been tightening credit in an effort
to forestall any substantial revival of inflation and, to some
degree, to support the dollar in foreign exchange markets.
   There is widespread conjecture on Wall Street that the Fed might
soon clamp down further with another increase in its discount rate.
   Concluded Zweig: ``We certainly don't have an inverted yield
curve right now, but we're getting closer, and if the dollar
continues to disrupt the financial markets, we might just get
there.''

   It's beginning to look a lot like a tight inventory Christmas,
everywhere you go.
   Today's opening of the nation's annual shopping marathon finds
retailers cautiously optimistic about improving their seasonal
sales, but conservative enough to stock sparingly.
   Lean inventories are unusual at this time of year when stores are
gearing up for the post-Thanksgiving rush that accounts for a large
slice of their yearly sales. But inventory control has become an
industry standard in 1988, as merchants puzzle through the second
year of a long slump.

<HEAD>Ghidella Resigns As Managing Director Of Fiat Auto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vittorio Ghidella, credited with being the
brain behind Fiat SpA's turnaround this decade, will resign as
managing director of Fiat Auto, the manufacturing unit of Italy's
largest private-sector conglomerate, it was announced Friday.
   The company said Ghidella, 57, will quit his post before year's
end. Cesare Romiti, managing director of Fiat SpA, will be nominated
at the next board meeting for Ghidella's position, it said.
   Ghidella is also the chairman of the luxury car subsidiaries
Lancia-Alfa Romeo and Ferrari.
   Ghidella's resignation follows speculation on the Milan stock
market that he may join General Motors Corp., the giant U.S.
automaker.
   The announcement of Ghidella's departure hurt Fiat stocks'
performance. Fiat shares fell 90 lire to 9,800 lire on the Milan
exchange on Friday.
   Ghidella had been appointed managing director of Fiat Auto in
1979, when the company was plagued by a severe deficit and by labor
unrest.
   He masterminded, along with Romiti, a reorganization of the auto
division, which included staff layoffs and robotization, and
achieved a major turnaround earlier this decade.
   Fiat said Ghidella's decision to leave was made ``after careful
examination of the strategic choices which Fiat must take to
confront the challenges of 1990s.''
   ``Having failed to find agreement on some essential aspects, it
was decided to bring to an end a long and profitable collaboration
for both parties,'' it said.

<HEAD>Shoppers May Face Shortages In Annual Shopping Spree</HEAD>

   Christmas shoppers wading into the post-Thanksgiving rush today
face a little added pressure this year: tight inventories.
   That's a business decision prompted by a long-running slump in
the retail business, but for consumers it means limited selection
and shortages of hot-selling items.
   Today's opening of the nation's annual shopping spree finds
retailers optimistic about improving their seasonal sales, but
conservative enough to stock sparingly.
   Inventories have been tight for much of the year, and few
retailers are likely to take many chances at this point.
   The advice from industry analyst Monroe Greenstein of the
investment firm Bear, Stearns & Co., is to shop early.
   ``If consumers want to buy popular items, they better not wait,''
he said.
   Many shoppers took that advice seriously.
   In the Dayton, Ohio, suburb of Miami Township, K mart manager
William Parsons said there were more than 400 shoppers in his store
by 7:20 a.m. He said luggage appears to be popular this year,
especially small, customized foot lockers. ``Those things are just
flying,'' he said.
   L.L. Bean Inc. opened a warehouse sale at 8 a.m. in Freeport,
Maine, and hundreds of people were waiting in line, said spokeswoman
Catharine Hartnett. The long line remained even an hour after the
doors opened, she said.
   There were already at least a dozen shoppers in line when
Levinsky's department store in Portland, Maine, opened at 7 a.m.,
said general manager Fred Bowering.
   Filene's Basement, Boston's highly popular discount department
store, was packed less than an hour after it opened. ``We're fed up
with all the people,'' said shopper Kathy Donahoe. ``Some of them
are really hostile.''
   The most popular items this season are expected to include
designer and cashmere sweaters, leather goods and compact disk
players and for children, Nintendo video games and Barbie dolls.
   ``It is still too early to get a true reading on whether this is
going to be a nail-biting Christmas. We never anticipated Christmas
1988 to be a barn-burner Christmas,'' said Mike Wellman, marketing
vice president for K mart Corp. in Troy, Mich.
   ``There are more people working, the election is behind us, and
people seem to be reasonably, if not optimistic, comfortable with
the shape of the economy.''
   K mart, with thousands of discount stores, book shops and
drugstores, expects holiday sales to run about 6 percent ahead of
last year _ in the range of most optimistic forecasts.
   For K mart, and other big retailers, the decisions that may make
or break Christmas 1988 were made as long as 16 months ago.
   ``We have been playing the whole inventory thing conservatively
all year long and that's continued right into Christmas,'' Wellman
said.
   Promotions are expected to help generate traffic.
   While the day after Thanksgiving is the traditional start of the
season, many stores have had their decorations up for weeks. At Saks
Fifth Avenue's flagship store in Manhattan, for instance, the
evergreens went up right after Halloween.
   To get Chicago shoppers in the spirit, Marshall Field's hired
carolers and minstrels to roam its stores and installed a Christmas
tree in one location that it calls ``the tallest indoor
handmade-ornament tree in the world.''
   Some ``sale'' signs and price markdowns will be popping up around
the country, but analysts say many of these promotions also were
planned in advance and prices have been adjusted to account for them.
   ``We continue to operate in a very competitive environment, and
we see some caution on the part of the consumer,'' said Kathy
Blackburn of Mervyn's, a Hayward, Calif.-based department store
chain.
   Sears, Roebuck & Co., the nation's largest retailer, plans to
give shoppers a taste of the new low prices that are part of its
recently announced restructuring plan.
   Most Sears stores will not switch to ``everyday low pricing''
until next year, but the company will still be touting holiday sale
items.
   Some retailers say price chopping may be inevitable later in the
season.
   In a survey conducted last month by the accounting firm Touche
Ross & Co., 90 percent of a group of 70 New England retailers said
major markdowns would take place earlier or at the same time as last
year.
   The last couple of weeks have been especially encouraging to some
retailers, who noticed a pickup in business immediately after the
elections.
   ``If you had asked me eight weeks ago, I wouldn't have been as
optimistic,'' said Randolph Burnette, division president of J.B.
White's Department Stores in Augusta, Ga.

<HEAD>Tribune Accepts Strike Settlement with Printers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Management of the Chicago Tribune has accepted a
settlement to end a 3-year strike by the newspaper's unionized
printers, officials said today.
   The printers, members of Local 16 of the Chicago Typographical
Union, approved the pact and an $8.56 million settlement fund Sunday
on a 180-43 vote.
   A company spokesman said lawyers accepted and signed the
settlement on behalf of the newspaper Thursday and forwarded it to
Morton Bahr, president of the Washington-based Communications
Workers of America, the parent body of the printers union.
   The agreement was crafted under the guidance of former U.S. Labor
Secretary W.J. Usery.
   Under the agreement, the 119 printers who have remained on strike
will have the option of a buyout or a lifetime annuity, as well as
receiving company-paid medical insurance.
   When the strike began 40 months ago, 240 printers walked off the
job.
   Under the agreement, the 50 printers who remain at the newspaper
after a 1986 unconditional offer to return can stay, or can each
accept a $30,000 cash buyout.
   The agreement does not affect strikes by mailers and pressmen at
the newspaper. Those unions and the company are involved in a series
of strike-related lawsuits and proceedings before the National Labor
Relations Board.
   The printers' strike largely resulted from the company's desire
to gain greater control over hiring and assignments in the composing
room. The unions representing mailers and pressmen went out in
sympathy with the printers, but Teamster drivers of delivery trucks
stayed on the job and distribution of the newspaper continued.
   Under the agreement, the printers also agreed to drop a lawsuit
pending in federal court. The lawsuit alleged that the company
violated a 1975 agreement in which members were guaranteed lifetime
employment in exchange for the introduction of new, labor-saving
technologies.

post-Thanksgiving Day trading today, faced with expectations of
higher oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 18.84 points to
2,073.44 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 364 up, 826
down and 450 unchanged.
   The session after Thanksgiving is usually one of the quietest
days on the year on Wall Street, as many market participants take a
long holiday weekend.
   This time, however, those traders who were present responded to
the news of a tentative agreement by members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries on production quotas aimed at shoring
up oil prices.
   The prospect of increased energy costs weighed down the credit
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell nearly $10 for each
$1,000 in face value this morning.
   The stock market followed suit, with the notable exception of
energy stocks.
   In the energy sector, Atlantic Richfield rose 1\ to 79\; Exxon [
to 42[; Chevron 1[ to 45]; Amoco 1\ to 72~, and Amerada-Hess ~ to
30[.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included International
Business Machines, down 1| at 116]; General Electric, down { at 43~;
Ford Motor, down ~ at 50\, and American Telephone & Telegraph, down
| at 28|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.95 to 150.46. At the American Stock Exchange, where many smaller
energy issues trade, the market value index was up .38 at 290.47.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 41.78 million shares at noontime,
down from 51.05 million at the same point Wednesday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
moderately higher in light trading today on the Chicago Board of
Trade, reflecting higher prices for soybeans and soybean meal in
Europe on Thursday.
   Up to 80,000 metric tons of soybean meal and as many as 40,000
metric tons of soybeans were traded at higher levels in Rotterdam,
the Netherlands, and ``that sparked interest here this morning
because it showed interest over there,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Forecasts for a dry weekend in the South American soybean belt
added to the bullish tone in the soy markets, he said.
   Futures prices of wheat and corn were up slightly on continuing
expectations that the Soviet Union and the United States will sign a
long-term grain sales agreement early next week.
   The grain markets are optimistic about a new grain pact with the
Soviets. ``If it doesn't happen, it'll be a disappointment,''
Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.20\ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 1} cents higher with December at $2.65 a bushel; oats were 2
cents higher across the board with December at $2.14\ a bushel;
soybeans were 3} cents to 6{ cents higher with January at $7.61} a
bushel.

   Cattle futures were slightly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .13 cent to .37 cent higher with December at
73.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .35 cent higher
with January at 82.70 cents a pound; hogs were .57 cent lower to .40
cent higher with December at 39.75 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .20 cent lower to .70 cent higher with February at
42.60 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Can Bush Keep His Word?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pressure to force George Bush to renege on
his promise not to raise taxes began months ago, but it turned
fierce within hours of his election as president. He must go back on
his word, they said.
   ``They'' can be just about anyone, so diverse is the ``they''
group. It includes financial leaders and labor leaders, tight-fisted
Republicans and liberal Democrats, conservative and ultraliberal
economists.
   So uniform is the cry it would seem to leave Bush with no
options, but it isn't so. He has several of them.
   Most cynical of them is to give in and then blame Congress, to
fight a battle worthy of his promise knowing that in the end he will
submit and, while still denouncing higher taxes, allow them to be
imposed.
   Another is only slightly less cynical, but it has been used over
and over in recent years. It is a creative technique, an art that
raises taxes without ever using the word ``tax,'' relying instead on
a string of elusive euphemisms.
   Why bring up the nasty ``T'' word when user fees, revenue
enhancers, earmarking, mandated benefits, education premiums and
other non-tax taxes have already been imposed and can be reused and
extended?
   Revenue enhancers, for example, raise funds without any
legislation or attendant controversy. Laws already on the books
simply are employed more intensively. Congress is not involved;
controversy is kept to a minimum.
   Revenue enhancing at the Internal Revenue Service, for instance,
means tightening procedures, hiring more auditors, scrutinizing
returns, challenging taxpayers and carrying more disputes to court.
   Aside from these two procedures, however, the Bush team has still
another option, and that is to hold firm.
   Such a stand would seem to require fortifying the White House and
building a moat around it, because the tax increase crowd is armed
for the battle with statistics, moral preaching and a near consensus
of economic thinking.
   Any economic consensus is a frightening thing, seeking to trample
and ridicule other notions. Uncertain, mercurial, changeable most of
the time, economists in consensus constitute a rigid, self-righteous
intellectual bloc.
   But there is another side to the budget deficit controversy, and
it is likely to emerge more forcefully over the next fe weeks in
response to the onslaught from advocates of a tax increase.
   Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based
conservative think tank that has been highly influential in the
Reagan administration, has challenged the consensus.
   Moore maintains that the deficit already is being reduced by
economic growth, and that if Congress holds spending to a rate of
less than 4 percent a year the entire deficit will be eliminated in
1993 _ without any new taxes.
   ``The facts are on Bush's side,'' says Moore. ``There is no
reason for him to retreat from his pledge.''
   Paul Craig Roberts, former White House adviser and now with
Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International
Studies, also contends the deficit already is being overcome.
   In a column for Business Week magazine, Roberts says Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others who claim we cannot
outgrow the deficit ``are in obvious contradiction to the fact that
we have been doing precisely that.''
   He also cites the view of Robert Eisner, a professor at
Northwestern University and president of the American Economic
Association, that the budget deficit might even be a product of
incorrect measurements.
   It is conceivable, in fact, that once the Bush team marshals its
economic arguments it might not even have to consider any option but
that of standing firm.

<HEAD>Court Blocks Polaroid Takeover Pending Disclosures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court stalled the $2.6
billion hostile takeover of Polaroid Corp. by Shamrock Holdings
Inc., ordering the investment group to make corrective disclosures
about its offer, Shamrock said.
   Shamrock, headed by Roy Disney, a nephew of the late Walt Disney,
planned to make the required disclosures promptly and seek to have
the court order lifted so it can pursue its offer to acquire the
instant-film company, Shamrock spokesman Tom Reed said Friday.
   The ruling was issued late Wednesday by the 3rd Circuit Court of
Appeals. The court instructed the U.S. District Court in Delaware to
enjoin the Shamrock offer until corrective disclosures were made.
   The court sought clarification of the applicability of federal
margin regulations to the offer, Reed said, calling the order to
provide more information a technicality.
   The ruling followed a Polaroid appeal of an earlier order to
provide the names and addresses of workers who participate in an
employee stock plan, Reed said.
   That legal wrangle is separate from a suit by Polaroid seeking an
order blocking Burbank-based Shamrock's $42-a-share tender offer to
buy the company from shareholders.
   ``That's the big case that will decide this thing,'' Reed said.
``This other thing about technical disclosures is just a little
sideshow.''
   Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware, where state laws make
hostile takeover bids more difficult to complete than in some other
states.

<HEAD>Argentine Wheat Farmers Unable To Cash in on U.S. Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Late rains dried up plans by
Argentine wheat farmers to cash in on last summer's drought in the
United States, further enhancing the switch to soybeans in this
agricultural exporter.
   ``Not just me, every farmer anticipated sowing more cereal
crops,'' said Alejandro Delfino, whose 1,976-acre farm lies in Santa
Fe province northwest of Buenos Aires.
   But the country's fertile pampas were hit by their own mild
drought during a three-month period through early October, when the
rains returned.
   The National Grain Board estimates 11.4 million acres of wheat
were planted, a decline of 494,000 acres from last year, which was
the smallest planting in a decade.
   ``Farmers intended to plant as much as 6 million hectares (14.8
million acres),'' said Hector Niell, the board's president, who
estimated that yields would drop by 20 percent an acre or more.
   The Ministry of Agriculture projects that wheat production will
amount to about 8.4 million tons, a drop of about a million tons
from this year's crop.
   The planting of other crops is taking place normally, however,
and 1989 looks to be another banner year for farmers, who reaped a
$1 billion bonanza when prices for soybeans soared due to the
drought in the United States.
   Prices have remained high, and Argentina's crop exports in 1989
should fetch $5.5 billion, or about $1 billion more than this year,
Niell said.
   An additional 2.5 million acres are being planted in soybeans,
affirming that as the main export crop in a country that for decades
depended most heavily on wheat. Farmers planted 10.4 million acres
of soybeans in 1988.
   Argentina is the world's No. 2 exporter of corn, No. 3 producer
of soybeans and No. 4 producer of wheat. Soybeans replaced wheat as
the country's top export in 1987.
   Total production _ wheat, soybeans, corn, sorghum, soybean oil,
pellets and other crops _ is projected at 38 million to 40 million
tons, up from 36 million tons in 1988, Niell said.
   About 12 tons are consumed domestically, and the rest is offered
for sale abroad, said Guillermo Toranzas, an economist for Rural
Society, a powerful farm group.
   Peak production _ 44 million tons _ was achieved in the 1984-85
season.
   ``Argentina easily could produce 60 million tons a year,'' bu
does not because of agricultural subsidies by the United States and
European Economic Community that protect their lucrative markets,
Niell said.
   But farm groups also complain about domestic barriers to
production.
   The most aggravating is a dual exchange system by which farmers
who want to import machinery are obliged to purchase U.S. dollars at
the commercial rate of 14 australs to 1, but are reimbursed by the
Central Bank for dollars they earn from export sales at the rate of
12-1.
   The system was imposed by the government in August to raise
revenue and foreign exchange. Farmers consider it an export tax.
   Also, farmers say Argentina's infrastructure deficiencies _
inadequate roads, out-of-date trains, lack of bank credits _ limits
production, as do government policies that favor industry at the
expense of agriculture.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles County had a yen for new dollars, so
it went across the Pacific to get some _ in a roundabout way.
   Deciding to forgo the public bond market, the county agreed to
borrow $100 million from Nippon Life Insurance Co. and Long Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., with the loan to be repaid over 10 years
at a below-market interest rate.
   While simple on the surface, getting to that point took two years
of ground-breaking bargaining.
   The pact is thought to be the first of its kind between a local
U.S. government body and foreign businesses. It involves a special
currency-swap arrangement, said Anthony C. Hughes, a vice president
at First Boston Corp., Los Angeles County's financial adviser.
   Under the agreement, he said, the county will receive $100
million worth of yen that will be converted into dollars at a fixed
rate. The loan will be repaid in dollars, then converted back to yen.
   Hughes said the currency rate will be fixed at the date of the
deal's closing, expected before year's end, and that will provide a
hedge against any risks from fluctuating currency exchange rates.
   A fixed interest rate also will guard against volatility in the
credit markets, which set the pace for rates. Interest repaid by the
county will be equal to the rate of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note
at the closing, plus 0.58 percentage point. At today's rates, that
is lower than the 10 percent charged for the prime lending rate of
major American banks.
   Hughes said that while the deal appears to be more favorable to
the county, it also will help boost Japan's image in the area.
``There is significant interest on the part of Japan to do business
in L.A. and with L.A.-based companies,'' he said.
   Hughes said the $100 million would be invested in high-grade
bonds, with the profits used to help reduce the unfunded liability
in the employees' retirement system.
   ``We have been shopping for opportunities in the taxable market,
and this is the first and best opportunity we have found,'' said
Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer.
   The county had been seeking alternatives to the domestic market
after Congress eliminated local government's ability to issue
tax-exempt pension bonds under the 1986 Tax Reform Act.
   While some analysts predicted the county's arrangement with
Nippon and Long Term Credit Bank might prompt other municipalities
to seek similar arrangements to get a more competitive interest
rate, those close to the Los Angeles County agreement were not so
sure, partly due to the complexity of their deal.
   ``We've had a lot of calls, mostly from municipalities that are
curious,'' said Sharon Yonashiro, director of public finance for the
county treasurer's office. ``(But) I'm not sure how broad this is
going to apply.''
   She also noted that most Japanese companies prefer to deal with
large loans.
   ``Other than very large borrowers, the U.S. taxable (bond) market
would generally be more attractive,'' she said.
   Neal Attermann, municipal reserach director of the investment
firm Kidder, Peabody & Co. Inc., agreed.
   He predicted such a deal could become a viable alternative if
California's controversial insurance rate rollback was upheld by the
courts and insurance companies ultimately left the state.
   ``California itself might have to become an insurer and go
abroad'' for funds, he said.

   The British pound grabbed the attention of the
European currency market Friday, taking an early plunge but ending
higher after news of a record British trade gap triggered a full
point rise in interest rates.
   The dollar ended slightly higher in a thin market, pushed up
primarily by a few big orders. Gold prices also rose.
   News that Britain's current account deficit widened to a record
2.43 billion pounds, or $4.5 billion, in October surprised the
financial markets, The figures sent the pound plunging to around
$1.8220 but dealers said selling was thin because most market
players expected the Bank of England to respond by triggering a hike
in base interest rates to 13 percent from 12 percent, which it did.
   High interest rates make pound-denominated investments more
attractive.
   The dollar received an early boost in Tokyo trading by persistent
intervention by the Bank of Japan, dealers said. The dollar also was
pushed higher by the pound's initial weakness following the trade
figures, plus a few big orders in the market, they said.
   In London, the pound gained to $1.8435 dollars from Thursday's
late $1.8375.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
1.7154 West German marks, up from 1.7135; 1.4365 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4375; 5.8615 French francs, up from 5.8585; 1.9368 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.9340; 1,275.50 Italian lire, up from 1,273.75;
and 1.1918 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1960.
   In Tokyo, where markets close before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 121.15 yen, unchanged from Thursday.
Later, in London, it also was quoted at 121.15 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $424.00 a troy ounce,
compared with Thursday's late bid of $420. In Zurich, gold rose to
$424 an ounce from $420.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed up $3.39 to $424.55 an ounce
Friday.
   Silver bullion prices gained ground on the London market, closing
at $6.18 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $6.14.

   News of the worst British trade deficit on record
and a consequent 1 percent rise in a key interest rate sent the
stock market into a tailspin Friday, as share prices finished
sharply lower.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down
38.3 points, or 2.1 percent, at 1,794.7, an improvement over the
session low of 50.5 points down.
   Its best level for the day came at the opening, when the index
was up 3.4 points.
   ``The bears are definitely out in force,'' a dealer said. Noting
that confidence in the market had been recovering lately, he said,
``But now everyone's been completely blown out of the water.''
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 31.1 points at
1,462.6 at the close.
   Volume was an active 713.1 million shares, up sharply from the
524.6 million shares traded Thursday.
   Wall Street was down 19.73 points at 2,072.72 as the London
session drew to a close, adding another pessimistic note to trading,
dealers said.
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit in October more than doubled
to 2.93 billion pounds, or around $5.4 billion, the Department of
Trade and Industry reported.
   Soon after the report was released in late morning, the Bank of
England, by increasing its own money-market lending rate, signaled a
1 percentage point rise in the commercial banks' base lending rate
to 13 percent. That was the key rate's highest level in more than
31@2 years.
   The Financial Times 500-share index fell 23.48 points to close at
1,017.14.

   Stock prices fell in slow post-Thanksgiving Day
trading today, depressed by expectations of higher oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 21.69 points to
2,070.59 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 407 up, 864
down and 481 unchanged.
   The session after Thanksgiving is usually one of the quietest

$1,000 in face value this morning.
   The stock market followed suit, with the notable exception of

<HEAD>Carnival to Buy Holland America's Seattle Operations for $625
Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holland America Line's Seattle-based travel and
tourism companies will be purchased by Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. of
Miami for approximately $625 million, the two companies announced
Friday.
   Officials of Carnival, one of the world's largest cruise lines,
described it as a significant consolidation in their business. The
announcement came one month after Carnival lost in its attempt to
take over another cruise operation, Royal Admiral Cruises Ltd.
   Micky Arison, president of Carnival and the son of its
billionaire majority owner Ted Arison, and Nico van der Vorm,
chairman of Holland America Line N.V., said in a joint announcement
that their companies had signed a letter of intent for Carnival to
buy Holland America's cruise operations, Westours tour operations,
Westmark Hotels and Windstar Sail Cruises.
   Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher said it would likely be an
all-cash transaction although details haven't been completed.
   The proposed sale is subject to signing of defintive agreements,
approval by both companies' boards of directors, and approval by
shareholders of Holland America. The sale is expected to close
before Jan. 15.
   Holland America operates four ships in the Caribbean and Alaska,
representing about 4,500 berths. Westmark has a chain of 18 hotels
in Alaska and western Canada, while Westours is the largest
wholesale tour operator in those areas.
   Windstar Sail Cruises operates three passenger sailing ships in
the South Pacific, Mediterranean and Caribbean.
   Van der Vorm will join Carnival's board of directors. The Holland
America companies will continue operating under their current names
and management with no merging of operations or change in products
planned, Arison said.
   Carnival operates seven cruise ships in the Bahamas, Caribbean
and Mexico, each equipped with a casino and usually fully booked.
The cruise line also operates a casino in the Bahamas and is builty
an 872-room luxury resort there.
   The cruise line is 80 percent owned by Ted Arison, 64, an Israeli
shipowner's son who is one of the world's wealthiest men. He has
been ranked No. 17 on the Forbes List of richest Americans with an
estimated fortune of $1.6 billion.
   Arison also has holdings in New York's Ensign Bank, an Atlanta
real estate firm and an interest in the Miami Heat basketball
franchise.
   He founded Carnival in 1972 with parnter Meshulam Riklis and
bought out his interests two years later. Arison took Carnival
public in 1986 and its shares are traded on the American Stock
Exchange.
   The price rose 12{ cents late Friday to $14.25.

   Stock prices slumped in very light
post-Thanksgiving Day trading today, depressed by expectations of
higher oil prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 20.27 points to
2,072.01 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 440 up, 863 down and
491 unchanged.
   The session after Thanksgiving is usually one of the quietest
days on the year on Wall Street, as many market participants take a
long holiday weekend.
   This time, however, those traders who were present responded
early in the session to the news of a tentative agreement by members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on production
quotas aimed at shoring up oil prices.
   The prospect of increased energy costs weighed down the credit
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell nearly $10 for each
$1,000 in face value this morning.
   The stock market followed suit, with the notable exception of
energy stocks.
   In the energy sector, Atlantic Richfield rose 1{ to 79{; Mobil }
to 43]; Chevron } to 45; Amoco 1] to 73, and Amerada-Hess ~ to 30[.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included International
Business Machines, down 1~ at 116[; General Electric, down { at 43~;
Ford Motor, down } at 50], and American Telephone & Telegraph, down
{ at 28}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.99 to 150.42. At the American Stock Exchange, where many smaller
energy issues trade, the market value index was up .43 at 290.52.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 62.29 million shares with an hour
to go.

   An American suit maker became the first
non-British tailoring firm to win the annual bidding for a prize
bale of premium Australian merino wool.
   J. Schoeneman Inc., a Baltimore company that makes men's clothes,
bid the equivalent of $4,800 to buy the ``Golden Bale'' auctioned by
Joseph Lumb & Sons in Huddersfield, England.
   Lumb, which established the Golden Bale Award to encourage the
production of high-quality merino wool in Australia, said previous
prize bales had been bought by a few exclusive tailors from London's
Savile Row.
   The prize bale, which was produced by Trevor Picker of Bigga, New
South Wales, brought a price 12 to 15 times greater than the average
bale of premium Austalian wool, Lumb said.

   This might be considered a crummy year for Boeing
Co. if it weren't selling commercial jets at the rate of $85 million
a day.
   There's been no dearth of bad news in 1988 for the giant
planemaker:
   Longtime customers complained about quality. Employees working
with new materials complained of mysterious ailments. The Navy was
upset with a contract. There are lingering problems with commuter
planes.
   A much-promoted new jumbo jet was delayed. So was a major ``Star
Wars'' project. So was a new helicopter. So was the president's new
jet.
   Most dramatically, a harrowing accident in which the top sheared
off a Boeing 737 over Hawaii underscored concerns about how long
airlines can continue to fly old jets.
   All of that aside, the company smashed industry records for
number and value of aircraft ordered in a single year.
   With this fourth straight year of record orders, Boeing has
guaranteed work for its two jetliner factories well into the
mid-1990s. Its Boeing Commercial Airplanes division is increasing
production across the board, only the third such time it's done so.
   Boeing has introduced two new passenger jets this year, plans a
third for May, and is thinking about a fourth and possibly a fifth.
   On the military and aerospace sides, several projects could start
moving from development into production in the next few years,
meaning they'll start bringing in money.
   ``They can have all eight cylinders percolating at the same time
here in a few years,'' said Paul Nisbet, aerospace industry analyst
for Prudential Bache Securities in New York.
   So far this year, Boeing has announced orders for 595 commercial
planes, worth $28 billion, up from 366 planes worth $19.9 billion
last year. Boeing has about two-thirds of the world commercial jet
market, with rivals Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
sharing the remainder.
   The record could go higher. Several major carriers, including
United Airlines and TWA, reportedly are considering major purchases.
   For the first nine months of 1988, Boeing earned $440 million, or
$2.88 a share, on sales of $12.09 billion, up from $339 millon, or
$2.18 a share, on sales of $10.87 billion in the same 1987 period.
   Boeing has an order backlog of more than 1,000 jets, and has been
setting delivery dates as late as 1995.
   To accommodate that growth, Boeing is boosting production of 767
widebodies and 747 jumbo jets next year, mid-sized 757 jetliners in
mid-1989 and the smaller 737s in mid-1990.
   ``An absolutely massive exercise,'' says Philip Condit, Boeing
Commercial Airplanes executive vice president for production and
engineering.
   In late summer, Boeing announced that electrical problems had
forced delays in delivery of the new 747-400 jumbo jet, the world's
largest commercial plane, to the first 20 customers. Deliveries are
expeted to be on track by second-quarter 1989.
   Boeing began 1988 with the unprecedented introduction of two new
aircraft on the same day: the 747-400 and the 737-400, an updated
and stretched version of the workhorse twinjet. Both are popular
sellers.
   But soon came word that some major Boeing customers, including
Japan Air Lines, British Airways, All Nippon Airways and American
Airlines, were upset at the quality of some planes they were getting.
   More production problems were reported in early summer, when
workers at a Boeing fabrication plant began reporting ailments
ranging from nosebleeds to headaches and memory loss. They
attributed the illnesses to chemicals used to make lightweight
aircraft parts.
   Air samples at the plant showed nothing untoward, but the
complaints have persisted. Two medical panels have been formed to
study the problem, and Boeing has cut back on the chemicals' use.
   On April 28, the top of an Aloha Airlines 737 ripped off at
24,000 feet, sweeping a flight attendant to her death before the
plane could land safely. The 19-year-old plane, with nearly 90,000
flights, was one of the most-used in the 737 fleet and the accident
prompted a round of investigations and discussions about aging
aircraft.
   Boeing says its planes have an indefinite life, if they are
properly maintained, and intensified its studies of older aircraft.
   The four airlines whose workmanship complaints were publicized
all have since made sizeable orders with Boeing. Aloha also bought
replacement 737s.
   Boeing offers eight aircraft models with anywhere from 108 to 660
seats. The planes are grouped into three ``families,'' 747s, 757-67s
and 737s, that share many systems, and don't require a pilot to
recertify to fly another model within a family.
   Boeing's newest plane, the 108-seat 737-500, rolls out next May.
And Condit said ``we're looking very hard'' at a larger 767.
   An existing 767-300 holds about 250 passengers, and Condit said
the new plane, designated 767-X, is envisioned at 300 or 350 seats,
or both.
   As Boeing speeds jet construction, it's struggling to keep its
money-losing de Havilland commuter plane line on schedule. Boeing
officials haven't hidden their disappointment since buying de
Havilland from Canada in 1986.
   In defense and space work, 1988 also has been uneven. This fall,
Boeing rolled out its first Avenger launch system for Stinger
missiles, and the space shuttle Discovery carried a Boeing-built
rocket booster in September.
   But there have been delays on several major projects, including
Navy A-6E attack aircraft, the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor helicopter and
the Airborne Optical Adjunct, a Strategic Defense Initiative project.
   Problems with wiring in two 747s being built as new Air Force
Ones pushed back the delivery of the first presidential jet 13
months to next November.
   Judith Comeau, analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York, said
Boeing's earnings from military and aerospace work will fall to $48
million this year from $179 million in 1987.
   How long can the good times roll? Depends on the economy, says
Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton. What it comes
down to, he says, is that if people have money to fly, airlines have
money to buy planes.
   Still, Condit remembers that both times Boeing increased
production on all its lines, in 1967-68 and 1978-79, it promptly was
pounded by a recession.
   ``Everybody's been watching that one,'' he said. ``Everybody's
been looking over their shoulder and saying, `OK, when?'''

<HEAD>Next Plane for Boeing: A Bigger Widebody, Not a 7J7</HEAD>

   Boeing Co.'s future probably holds one and
possibly two larger widebody jets and a supersonic transport,
company executives say. But not the 7J7.
   When first proposed three years ago, the 7J7 _ ``J'' for the
consortium of Japanese manufacturers interested in the plane _ was
to be one of the most innovative planes Boeing ever built.
   It was to make extensive use of composites and other high-tech
materials, ``fly by wire'' electronic controls, computerized
instruments and a new ``unducted fan'' engine that would have
external propellers.
   Trouble was, Boeing said after postponing the program last year,
``market indicators continued to present different requirements on
airplane size and configuration.''
   Translation: Nobody wants to buy one.
   Asked recently whether the 7J7 would ever be built, Philip
Condit, executive vice president for production and engineering at
Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: ``As described at that point,
probably not.''
   He said manufacturers have to try to guess market demands 10
years into the future.
   ``Our best guess is there is going to be a fair amount of
pressure, due to (airport) gate constraints, congestions, on the
bigger sizes,'' Condit said. ``That's why the effort now on 767-X.''
   The 767-X is a new, larger version of the 767 widebody, which
comes in two sizes _ the model 200, which holds 216 passengers in
two classes, and the 300, which carries 261.
   Condit said Boeing is considering a version that would seat 300
people and possibly a version for 350 passengers.
   The 767 is becoming more attractive to airlines thanks to a
Federal Aviation Administration rule change earlier this year
allowing the two-engine planes to fly routes 120 minutes away from
usable airports. That qualifies it for use on many over-water routes.
   Richard Albrecht, executive vice president for sales and
marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the company expects
the FAA to extend the authorization to 180 minutes soon, which would
allow 767s to fly trans-Atlantic routes.
   Boeing also has plans for a supersonic airliner, but executives
doubt it will fly in the next 20 years.
   ``The economics of the supersonic transport have to be roughly
comparable to that of the subsonic transport in order for it to make
sense commercially,'' Albrecht said.
   A supersonic flight between Los Angeles and Australia might take
five hours instead of 15 aboard a 747, but Albrecht says he doubts
too many passengers would pay double the fare to save that time.
   While the Concorde supersonic airliner has been successfully
marketed as a premium trans-Atlantic service, ``I don't believe
anybody will build the next generation of the supersonic transport
to serve a niche market, which is what the Concorde is serving
now,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wheat, Soybeans Post Solid Gains In Broad Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of wheat and soybeans posted solid
gains Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a broad rally.
   Analysts said the rally was fueled by brisk soybean trade on
European markets and expectations for a new U.S.-Soviet grain
agreement.
   The wheat market had its strongest day since Oct. 3. Wheat
futures surged in response to a French press report that U.S. and
Soviet negotiators would open a final round of talks Monday in
Moscow on renewing a 5-year grain pact that expired on Sept. 30. A
2-year extension is expected.
   Analysts said up to 80,000 metric tons of soybean meal and as
many as 40,000 metric tons of soybeans exchanged hands at higher
prices in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, during the week, an indication
that export demand for U.S. soybeans may also rise.
   Recurring talk of dry conditions in the South American soybean
belt, where planting is well underway, also lent support to the
soybean market. But analyst Cathy Leow of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York said such concerns were premature.
   ``There are some areas of dryness but at this point in the crop
year you can't get too excited about it,'' she said.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 1} cents to 7{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.25{ a bushel; corn
was 1} cents to 2} cents higher with December at $2.65 a bushel;
oats were 2} cents to 5 cents higher with December at $2.15 a
bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 12} cents higher with January at
$7.66{ a bushel.

   Wickes Cos. Inc. will sell its WCI
Financial Corp. subsidiary for about $300 million to a corporation
founded by two company executives, the retailing conglomerate
announced Friday.
   The deal for Wickes' credit card provider, expected to close next
Wednesday, isn't dependent on the $538.9 million acquisition of
Wickes by two New York investment groups, Wickes spokesman Michael
Sitrick said.
   WCI president James E. Neese and Wickes vice president and
treasurer Ervin J. Bolks organized the purchase to be financed by
General Electric Capital Corp., Sitrick said. The credit card
company will retain its name.
   WCI provides private label credit card programs for retail stores
with substantial concentration in the furniture industry. It will
continue to provide such programs for Wickes Furniture division,
Sitrick said.
   The Blackstone Group and Wasserstein, Perella & Co., the two
investment-banking groups buying Wickes, announced previously they
might break up and sell parts of the company with holdings such as
Wickes Furniture, Builders Emporium home improvement stores and
Orchard Supply Hardware stores.
   The investment groups also will replace Sanford Sigoloff, the
Wickes chairman who saved the company from bankruptcy and sought to
take it private in an unsuccessful leveraged buyout, which led to
the investor groups' successful takeover bid.

   Crude oil prices soared Friday after OPEC
ministers announced a tentative accord on curbing production, but
analysts expressed skepticism the cartel would be able to restrain
output for long.
   Analysts said they doubted the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would succeed in driving prices back
up to their target of $18 a barrel even in the short run.
   The analysts also said consumers should see little effect from
the agreement.
   ``We don't know if OPEC nations are going to adhere to an
agreement,'' said William Byers, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co.
in New York. ``If so, prices could go higher, but that's an
assumption that's premature to make.''
   Steve Hanke, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University
in Baltimore, said: ``Cheating could occur right from day one. And
in fact, there's every reason to believe it will.''
   OPEC members have been producing far above the cartel's overall
ceiling set in a 1986 agreement.
   Final approval was still up in the air for the latest accord,
which hinged on Iran accepting production parity with Iraq. Iranian
Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh, who previously had said Iran
would never agree to sharing an equal quota with Iraq, flew to Iran
Friday morning to seek agreement from his government to do just that.
   To win agreement, the ministers apparently agreed to allow Iran
to pump more oil, while most of the remaining countries would cut
output to meet the new overall ceiling.
   The ministers scheduled a meeting for Saturday evening for a
formal vote on the pact.
   Asked if he thought the proposed agreement would be ratified,
Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer sounded cautious. ``I hope
so, yes,'' he replied.
   The oil minister for the United Arab Emirates, Mana Saeed Otaiba,
also left to consult with his president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al
Nahyan, who was in Rabat, Morocco. The UAE is one of several OPEC
members that have been openly violating their quotas.
   The proposed agreement calls for OPEC to sharply cut its
production from an estimated 22.5 million barrels a day currently to
18.5 million barrels a day in the first six months of the year. The
aim is to reduce the glut of crude oil on the world market and
bolster prices.
   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, said the
cartel ``will try to achieve that (the benchmark price) as quickly
as possible.''
   ``I think we can reach that within a few months,'' he said.
   But Fergus MacLeod, an oil analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd in
London, said he doubted the price of West Texas Intermediate, the
major U.S. crude grade, would climb beyond $17 a barrel.
   In London, the price for January delivery of Brent, the benchmark
North Sea crude, shot up $1.67 a barrel to $14.42. It had been
trading below $12 a barrel before the OPEC meeting.
   The New York Mercantile Exchange was closed Thursday and Friday
for the Thanksgiving holiday so there was no trading in West Texas
Intermediate. The January contract for that grade rose 11 cents a
barrel to $13.97 on Wednesday.
   Analysts predicted the OPEC accord would have only a minimal
impact on consumers.
   Ian Graham, an analyst at the London investment firm County
NatWest, noted that oil companies had not lowered gasoline prices
during the recent slump in crude oil prices.
   ``There seems little justification for increasing them on the way
back up,'' he said.
   MacLeod also said he doubted oil companies would try to pass an
increase through to the retail level.
   The tentative accord was announced late Thursday after a week of
informal, private negotiating sessions at OPEC's annual winter
meeting. Much of the talking was aimed at resolving the bitter
dispute between Iran and Iraq, which ended an 8-year war in August.
   Iraq demanded an equal production quota in any new accord with
Iran, but Aghazadeh said Iran would never agree to that. Iraq had
refused to abide by the previous production agreement because it was
not given parity with Iran.
   OPEC did not release details of the tentative agreement, but one
provision would give Iran and Iraq the same daily production quota
of 2.64 million barrels without diminishing Iran's demand to retain
a 14 percent share of OPEC's total output. Under the current
production agreement, Iran had a quota of 2.4 million barrels.
   Analysts calculated Saudi Arabia would have a quota of about 4.52
million barrels a day under the new proposal, up from 4.35 million
barrels in the existing accord. That would be a sharp drop from the
6 million barrels that Saudi Arabia is thought to have been pumping
recently.
   The United Arab Emirates, which has been greatly exceeding its
current ceiling of 948,000 barrels a day, would get a new cap of
986,000, according to an estimate by MacLeod.

   A tentative OPEC accord aimed at boosting crude
prices by cutting back output would have little immediate impact on
Texas oil producers, industry experts said Friday.
   But it could help bolster natural gas prices and brighten the
budget outlook for the 1989 Legislature, they said.
   Iraq's oil minister predicted the tentative deal would send crude
oil prices soaring to $18 a barrel within a few months, although
analysts said they doubted prices would rise that high.
   ``Obviously, from the standpoint of Texas, the higher the price
of oil, the better our economy can perform,'' said Ray Perryman,
director of the Baylor University Forecasting Service.
   ``Over the short term, our economy has been driven by other
things, such as manufacturing, but over the long term it would have
a much more substantial effect,'' Perryman said.
   The tentative deal worked out by the ministers of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was announced late
Thursday. It would reduce the amount of oil OPEC has been producing
by an estimated 4 million barrels a day.
   But given the history of in-fighting among cartel members and
cheating on individual quotas, many analysts predicted the agreement
would not last long enough to push prices up to $18 from the
$14-a-barrel range.
   Nevertheless, such a steep climb would not prompt drastic changes
among Texas oil producers, but could stimulate exploration and
production among natural gas companies next spring when gas prices
would otherwise fall after a peak season, experts said.
   ``The impact would obviously be positive, but I don't think the
impact would be as much as some people might think,'' said Charles
M. Strain, director of energy research for Lovett Mitchell Webb &
Garrison in Houston.
   ``Based on our conversations with major oil companies, and even
smaller producers, they are not reacting to short-term swings in
price anymore,'' Strain said. ``They are not going to change their
expenditure plans dramatically when prices go down to $13 for a
month or two, or go up to $20 for a month or two.''
   Perryman also expects some hesitation among producers who have
watched OPEC ignore past production quotas. However, he predicted an
agreement could draw immediate reaction in the halls of the Texas
Capitol.
   ``Probably the most interesting short-term effect is the impact
on state revenues. It could literally change the entire character of
the next legislative session if they go in with oil at $18 a barrel
instead of $13,'' Perryman said.
   ``If they go in with oil at $18 the way things are structured
right now on the revenue base, the legislators would probably be
looking at a small surplus, and that would enable them to focus on
other issues,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pound Finishes Higher In Volatile Trading; Dollar Up Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar crept slightly higher against several
key currencies in quiet dealings Friday, but the British pound took
center stage in volatile trading linked to the latest report on
Britain's trade deficit.
   The metals markets were closed for the Thanksgiving Day holiday
in the United States, but gold prices strengthened overseas.
   James Chorek, a technical analyst with MMS International in
Chicago, said the dollar received an early boost from persistent
intervention by the Bank of Japan.
   The dollar also was helped later in the trading session by
speculation that the Federal Reserve might push up short-term
interest rates by raising the discount rate, or the interest charged
on loans to member banks.
   Higher interest rates tend to support a currency, and that was
the case with the pound Friday. It ended higher in domestic and
European trading after news of a record British $4.5 billion trade
gap triggered a full point rise in interest rates.
   The trade report had sent the pound plunging to around $1.8220 in
Europe, but dealers said it rebounded after the Bank of England
pushed up base interest rates to 13 percent from 12 percent.
   In London, the pound rose to $1.8435 from Thursday's late
$1.8375. Later, in New York, sterling fetched $1.84235, up from
$1.8365.
   In Tokyo, where markets close before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar ended at 121.15 Japanese yen, unchanged from
Thursday. It also was quoted at 121.15 yen in London.
   But in New York it rose to 121.175 yen from 120.95 Friday, when
it reached a 40-year low.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.7170 West German marks, up from 1.7155; 1.43725 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4360; 1.19025 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19625;
5.8705 French francs, up from 5.8645; and 1,275.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,276.375.
   The dollar did not trade in New York Thursday in observance of
Thanksgiving Day.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday: 1.7154
West German marks, up from 1.7135; 1.4365 Swiss francs, down from
1.4375; 5.8615 French francs, up from 5.8585; 1.9368 Dutch guilders,
up from 1.9340; 1,275.50 Italian lire, up from 1,273.75; and 1.1918
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1960.
   The Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold and silver are
traded, was closed Friday.
   But in London, gold rose to a late bid price of $424.00 a troy
ounce, compared with Thursday's late bid of $420. In Zurich,
Switzerland, gold rose to $424 an ounce from $420.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed up $3.39 to $424.55 an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices gained ground on the London market, closing
at $6.18 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $6.14.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices tumbled and interest rates surged in
light post-holiday trading Friday amid concerns that the dollar may
continue to fall while inflationary pressures intensify.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond dropped | point, or
about $6.25 for every $1,000 in face amount.
   Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price
and is often seen as an indicator of broader interest rate trends,
climbed to 9.17 percent from 9.10 percent late Wednesday.
   The bond market was closed Thursday for the observance of
Thanksgiving, and analysts said dealings also were light on Friday
as many traders took a four-day weekend.
   The cash markets for Treasury securities closed in the early
afternoon, several hours earlier than normal, on the recommendation
of the Public Securities Association.
   But analysts said speculation that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would ratify a tentative oil production accord
over the weekend had already knocked bond prices sharply lower.
   The 13-nation cartel hopes that production restraint will lift
oil prices.
   ``Oil prices had been a positive disinflation force, so the bond
market saw (the tentative OPEC agreement) as disappointing,'' said
David Hale, economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
   If oil prices rose, the increase would add to inflationary
pressures at a time when the economy is already operating at a
relatively high rate. Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income
securities such as Treasury notes and bonds.
   Hale said another reason bond prices fell was speculation that
the dollar may be headed lower, possibly discouraging foreign
investors from maintaining their holdings of dollar-denominated
securities.
   The dollar has been falling steadily since the election of George
Bush because of doubts that the Republican president and a
Democrat-controlled Congress will be able to take effective steps to
reduce the U.S. trade and budget deficits.
   William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money-market research at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the price decline also reflected
bond dealers' efforts to find retail buyers for the big supply of
new two- and five-year Treasury notes that the dealers bought at
auction earlier this week.
   ``We've got too many negatives on the table here,'' Sullivan said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues fell \ point, intermediate maturities lost about {
point and long-term issues dropped ~ point, according to Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, fell 4.24 to 1,130.28.
   In the corporate bond market, prices lost ground. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, was down 1.04 to 292.69.
   In the tax-exempt market, prices dropped by about ] point,
according to the Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.29 percent as the
discount rose 4 basis points to 8.02 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.57 percent as the discount rose 5 basis points to
8.12 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.76 percent as the
discount rose 7 basis points to 8.12 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8] percent, up from 85-16
percent late Wednesday.

   Stock prices slumped and trading volume hit its
lowest levels in nearly two years on Wall Street Friday in a session
squeezed in between the Thanksgiving holiday and a weekend.
   The market's drop was concentrated in the first half hour of the
session, prompted by expectations of rising world oil prices. After
that, prices drifted aimlessly and activity turned very thin.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 17.60 points to
2,074.68, finishing the week with a net gain of 12.27.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
520 up, 783 down and 520 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 72.09 million
shares, down from 112.01 million Wednesday and the lightest total
since a 48.86 million-share day on Dec. 26, 1986.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 85.46 million shares.
   The session after Thanksgiving is usually one of the quietest
days on the year on Wall Street, as many market participants take a
long holiday weekend.
   This time, however, those traders who were present responded
early in the session to the news of a tentative agreement by members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on production
quotas aimed at shoring up oil prices.
   The prospect of increased energy costs weighed down the credit
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell nearly $10 for each
$1,000 in face value at their lowest levels of the day.
   The stock market followed suit, with the notable exception of
energy stocks.
   In the energy sector, Atlantic Richfield rose 2\ to 80\; Mobil 1
to 43|; Chevron 1 to 45\; Amoco 1{ to 73[, and Amerada-Hess 1 to 30\.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included International
Business Machines, down 2 at 116; General Electric, down | at 43};
Ford Motor, down 1[ at 50; DuPont, down 1 at 80, and Procter &
Gamble, down ~ at 80\.
   San Diego Gas & Electric climbed 1} to 38{. The company said it
would study a sweetened merger proposal from SCEcorp, under which
holders would receive 1.3 SCE shares for each common share of San
Diego Gas & Electric.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $11.34 billion, or 0.43
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .78 to 150.63.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 1.81 to 307.64, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was down 1.77 at 267.23.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.38 to 366.38. At the American Stock Exchange, where many
smaller energy issues are traded, the market value index closed at
291.19, up 1.10.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Surge On Hopes For Soviet Grain Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices posted their strongest gains in nearly two
months Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid signs that the
United States and the Soviet Union were nearing agreement on a new
multi-year grain deal.
   On other markets, soybeans and other grains also advanced; cotton
futures surged; cattle futures were higher; pork futures were mixed;
and stock-index futures retreated.
   The major U.S. markets for oil, metal, coffee, cocoa and sugar
futures were closed Friday for Thanksgiving.
   Heavy speculation surfaced Wednesday that U.S. and Soviet
negotiators were about to sign a grain pact, and those expectations
were enhanced on Friday by a French Press Agency report that a final
round of talks would begin Monday in Moscow.
   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Alan Holmer confirmed after the
grain markets closed that the talks would resume next week in the
Soviet Union.
   The pact being discussed was rumored to be a 2-year extension of
the 5-year agreement that expired Sept. 30, guaranteeing annual
Soviet purchases of 9 million metric tons of U.S. grain _ 4 million
of wheat, 4 million of corn and 1 million of the buyer's choice.
   Wheat futures prices leaped 3 cents to 7{ cents higher on the
news _ the sharpest one-day rally since Oct. 3 _ with the contract
for delivery in December settling at $4.25{ a bushel.
   ``We're confident the long-term agreement will be signed early
next week, by Monday or Wednesday or so,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
grain trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``If not, it could be a problem,'' he said. ``And even if it is
signed, it could be a case of that old saying, `Buy the rumor, sell
the fact.'''
   Soybean futures hit new highs for the week in response to brisk
trade in soybeans and soybean meal on European markets on Thursday
and Friday, an indication that export demand for U.S. soybeans may
rise.
   Recurring talk of dry conditions in the South American soybean
belt, where planting is well underway, also supported the soybean
market. But analyst Cathy Leow of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
in New York said such concerns were premature.
   ``There are some areas of dryness but at this point in the crop
year you can't get too excited about it,'' she said.
   Soybeans settled 4 cents to 12 cents higher with January at
$7.65} a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 3\ cents higher with December
at $2.65 a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 5 cents higher with
December at $2.15 a bushel.
   Cotton futures surged on the New York Cotton Exchange on
indications of increased demand, analysts said.
   The soon-to-expire contract for December delivery opened 2.4
cents higher, an extremely sharp gain, in reaction to a pending
17,200-bale decline in the exchange's certificated warehouse stocks.
The owners have declared their intention to decertificate the cotton
because they have found buyers for it.
   ``I have hardly ever seen a big figure like that pending
decertification,'' said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``That brings the
certificated stock down to 33,500 bales. That's a small stock.''
   In addition, Simon said, U.S. cotton is beginning to find more
overseas buyers despite its high price on the world market. A USDA
report issued after the close of trading said cotton exports for the
week ending Nov. 17 were about 45 percent above both the prior week
and the four-week average.
   Simon said the reliability of U.S. cotton suppliers apparently
was the reason for recent sales to South Korea, Indonesia and the
Philippines.
   Cotton settled .67 cent to 1.90 cents higher with December at
55.70 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures gained modestly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
on strong spot markets and expectations for higher spot markets next
week. Pork futures finished mixed amid expectations of lower spot
hog prices on Monday, analysts said. Trading activity was light.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .48 cent higher with December at
73.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .28 cent higher
with January at 82.67 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to .23
cent higher with December at 39.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .35 cent lower to .17 cent higher with February at
42.45 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated substantially on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 1.9 points lower at 267.35. Each
point is worth $500.

   The broadest measure of the nation's money supply
rose in the week ended Nov. 14 but two narrower measurements fell,
the Federal Reserve Board reported Friday.
   The Fed said its all-encompassing measure of money known as M3
rose to a seasonally adjusted $3.881 trillion, up from $3.878
trillion the previous week. A narrower measure known as M2 averaged
a seasonally adjusted $3.044 trillion, down from $3.045 trillion the
prior week.
   The narrowest measure, known as M1, fell by $2.4 billion to a
seasonally adjusted average of $779.3 billion, vs. a revised figure
of $781.7 billion the prior week.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the dollar's value, commodity prices and the difference
between short- and long-term interest rates, rather than focusing
heavily on money supply figures. It also has suggested that of the
three figures, M2 and M3 are more significant.
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual
growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose by $160 million
in the week ended Nov. 16, vs. a decline of $59 million the previous
week.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $294 million a day in
the week ended Wednesday, down from $540 million a day the previous
week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $285.1 billion in the two-week period ended Nov. 16, up from
$283.5 billion two weeks earlier.

   The government on Friday pushed up interest rates a
full percentage point to 13 percent, their highest level in more
than 3 1@2 years, after announcing that Britain's merchandise trade
deficit for October more than doubled to a record level.
   Financial markets were shocked by the news of the first rate hike
since a full-point increase on Aug. 25 and of the unexpectedly large
trade shortfall of 2.93 billion pounds, or about $5.4 billion.
   Share prices plunged on the London Stock Exchange, with the
Financial Times 100-share index falling as much as 50.5 points
before recovering somewhat. The index finished 38.3 points, or 2.1
percent, lower at 1,794.7.
   The pound also plummeted on the trade news, but the interest rate
increase pushed it back up. It was quoted at $1.8435 in late
trading, up from $1.8375 late Thursday.
   The developments raised new questions about the effectiveness of
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's policy of fighting inflation _
her No. 1 economic priority _ by discouraging consumption with
higher interest rates.
   But Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the interest
rate hike was ``a clear indication that this government is not
prepared to take any risks with inflation.''
   The government has pushed up interest rates by a total of 5.5
percentage points since June. But the annual inflation rate still
has risen to 6.4 percent from 3.3 percent in January, partly because
the rate hikes have meant higher mortgage rates.
   The poor trade figures for October confirmed that consumption
hasn't slowed: car imports were up 10 percent, for example. But the
Department of Trade and Industry partly blamed the figures on
erratic items as well as distortions caused by a mail strike in
September.
   Lawson, speaking to a group of businessmen in Birmingham, said he
would prefer to average September's good figures and October's
``freak'' result.
   ``Having said that, it is perfectly clear that we have got
imports still rising strongly,'' he added. ``Although the earlier
rises in interest rates have been undoubtedly having an effect,
which you can see in the housing market for example, interest rates
do take time to have their full effect.''
   Chris Anthony, an economist at the London brokerage firm of
Phillips and Drew Ltd., said the October trade report was ``a clear
indication that the government's policies haven't begun to work on
the trade front. There is still no clear sign of a downturn in
consumption.''
   David Smith, economist at the brokers William de Broe Hill
Chaplin and Co., said: ``Consumption hasn't appeared to be that
interest-rate sensitive.''
   Some economists said interest rates had to go still higher.
   But opposition legislator Bryan Gould, who serves as the Labor
Party's spokesman on trade issues, said Lawson's strategy was
causing ``great damage'' to British industry.
   A half-hour after the Department of Trade and Industry reported
at 11:30 a.m local time that exports fell 10 percent as imports
surged 12 percent in October, the Bank of England, by raising its
money-market lending rate, signalled commercial banks to increase
their 12 percent base lending rate to 13 percent. That is the key
rate's highest level since April 1985.
   Britain's four leading commercial banks _ Barclays Bank PLC,
National Westminster Bank PLC, Lloyds Banks PLC and Midland Bank PLC
_ quickly raised their lending rates to 13 percent.
   Commercial borrowers can get loans at 1 percentage point above
the base lending rate.

<HEAD>Hearing Called Off in Pillsbury-Grand Met Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court hearing that had been set for Monday
in the Delaware lawsuit against Pillsbury Co. has been called off
because the food and restaurant company has postponed the record
date of its planned spinoff of Burger King.
   Hostile suitor Grand Metropolitan PLC is suing Pillsbury to block
the spinoff and invalidate Pillsbury's ``poison pill'' defense,
designed to make a takeover prohibitively expensive.
   The British liquor, gambling and specialty products conglomerate
says the two defense tactics are preventing Pillsbury shareholders
from cashing in on Grand Met's $5.23 billion tender offer,
equivalent to $60 a share.
   A hearing had been scheduled for Monday in Delaware Chancery
Court on the Burger King spinoff, but a clerk for Chancellor William
Allen said Friday it was called off.
   Joseph Rosenthal, a lawyer for dissident Pillsbury shareholders,
said the need for a hearing on Monday was eliminated when Pillsbury
postponed the record date of the planned spinoff from Dec. 2 to Dec.
19.
   Rosenthal said Friday the spinoff issue probably will be
addressed at a court hearing Dec. 12 before Chancellor Allen.
   Early this week, Pillsbury delayed its plans to spin off Burger
King into a separate company after Burger King franchisees voiced
opposition to the spinoff, saying it would add too much debt to the
slumping fast-food chain that accounts for a large portion of
Pillsbury's profits.
   Under the plan, Pillsbury shareholders would be issued stock in
the newly separated Burger King, which would borrow money and issue
a special dividend to shareholders.
   Grand Met has said a separate Burger King would present a huge
tax liability to Grand Met if its takeover bid is successful.

<HEAD>Tentative Settlement in Hilton's Battle Over Father's Estate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. Chairman and
President Barron Hilton on Friday tentatively settled a dispute with
the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation over acquiring stock held in his
father's estate.
   The agreement would give Barron Hilton and the charitable
foundation control of about 34 percent of outstanding shares of
Hilton Hotels common stock, with the chairman having sole voting
power over about 25 percent.
   The settlement is subject to execution of a definitive agreement
in Los Angeles Superior Court, which has jurisdiction over Conrad
Hilton's estate, and approval by the Internal Revenue Service, which
will take several months.
   The accord provides that of the 13.5 million shares held in the
estate, 4 million shares be distributed to Barron Hilton, 3.5
million shares to the foundation, and 6 million shares to Barron
Hilton as a trustee of a charitable remainder trust.
   That trust would last the lifetime of the 62-year-old Barron
Hilton or 20 years, whichever is longer. Sixty percent of income
would go to Hilton and 40 percent to the foundation. When the trust
expires, remaining assets go to the foundation.
   The pact resolves a dispute over 6.78 million shares given to the
foundation when Conrad Hilton died in 1979 at age 91. His will gave
his son an option to buy all the stock that couldn't be properly
held by the foundation.
   An announcement of the deal Friday provided no other details of
the tentative agreement. Representatives of parties to the agreement
could not immediately be reached by phone.
   In March the state's 2nd District Court of Appeal reversed a Los
Angeles County probate judge's decision and concluded that the
stock-purchase option granted by the father to the son covered all
6.78 million shares.
   A 1969 IRS rule prohibits private foundations from owning more
than 20 percent of any public company. Barron Hilton claimed that
since the rule was violated he could exercise his option to buy all
the stock at $24 a share, or $163 million, its value at the time of
his father's death.
   The foundation reclassified itself as a public-support
organization to avoid the rule. In April 1987 a probate judge ruled
that action was proper and the foundation didn't need to divest
itself of the stock.
   Barron Hilton appealed, resulting in the Court of Appeal ruling
last March.

<HEAD>Oil Up, Home Sales Down, Markets Weak, Christmas Buying Appears
Strong</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   News of rising oil prices hurt the stock and bond markets but
trading was light and most Americans paid no attention anyway,
preoccupied instead with that annual post-Thanksgiving pilgrimage,
Christmas shopping.
   Oil traders bid up the price by more than $1 a barrel Friday to
the $14.40 level on international markets because of the expectation
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would ratify
a tentative production accord to limit output and help reduce a
chronic supply glut.
   While OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna, Austria, appeared
determined to enforce production discipline, industry analysts
expressed skepticism, given the cartel's history of failing to honor
its own pacts because of member cheating.
   Some analysts said they didn't believe the price rise would have
much of an impact on prices of gasoline or other petroleum products
because it would be short-lived.
   Still, the magnitude of the oil increase rattled the bond market,
a key barometer of the economy, inflation and interest rates. Prices
of 30-year Treasury bonds dropped sharply and their yields, which go
in the opposite direction, climbed to 9.17 percent from 9.10 percent
late Wednesday.
   The impact spilled onto Wall Street where stocks slumped, partly
because rising yields in the bond market tend to siphon investor
money out of stocks. But trading volume was the lightest in nearly
two years, since many investment professionals had taken the day off
for a four-day Thanksgiving weekend.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.60 points to 2,074.68.
   The markets evidently saw little significance in a National
Association of Realtors report that showed sales of existing homes
fell in October for the second straight month, even though mortgage
rates declined. The report suggested the economy is slowing down.
   None of this news appeared to dampen consumer enthusiasm for
Christmas shopping, an annual rite on the day after Thanksgiving.
   A random spot check of stores nationwide by The Associated Press
suggested a surprisingly strong beginning to the traditional
Christmas selling season, a crucial time for retailers. The mood
contrasted with the cautious buying that has pervaded during the
previous few years.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rise If OPEC Accord Signed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An agreement to curtail OPEC's rampant oil
production could produce a temporary rise in petroleum prices, but
any change is likely to be short-lived, analysts say.
   Ministers from the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries were expected to meet again Saturday in Vienna, Austria,
to ratify a proposed six-month oil reduction accord.
   But analysts remained skeptical over just how long the deal would
last or how much impact it would have on prices.
   ``In reality, we'll see whatever potential gains are going to
come from this accord on Monday,'' said William Byers, an analyst
with Bear, Stearns & Co. ``The market will level off after Monday.''
   On the International Petroleum Exchange in London Friday, prices
for January delivery of Brent, the benchmark North Sea crude oil,
climbed $1.65 a barrel to $14.42.
   U.S. petroleum exchanges closed early Wednesday for a four-day
Thanksgiving holiday, but analysts said U.S. markets would match the
European gains if the OPEC ministers signed a final accord over the
weekend.
   Futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed
slightly higher on Wednesday in anticipation that OPEC would reach
some sort of agreement. The contract for January delivery of West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, closed 11
cents higher at $13.97 a barrel after sharp swings during the
trading session.
   Prices had convulsed upward since Monday when OPEC convened its
winter meeting in Vienna. Analysts said the highly erratic trading
sessions reflected the dramatic twists and turns emanating from the
conference of ministers.
   Late Thursday, the ministers announced a tentative pact to reduce
output from the more than 22 million barrels a day estimated now to
18.5 million barrels. The meeting was recessed until Saturday night
to allow Iran's oil minister to return home to consult with his
government.
   One of the key provisions of the pact would grant Iraq production
parity with Iran, something Iran had fought bitterly. However, the
proposal also reportedly would allow Iran to increase its production
and maintain its 14 percent share of OPEC production.
   Analysts said they expect an agreement to bolster prices in the
short term, but said they doubted the accord would last long enough
to boost prices to OPEC's target of $18 a barrel.
   Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chief economist for Ashland Oil Inc., said
he expected a short-term strengthening of prices if a deal is signed.
   ``But once the market fundamentals hit, prices will go down,'' he
said.
   Steve H. Hanke, chief economist of Friedberg Commodity Management
Inc. in Toronto and a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins
University, said a combination of excess capacity, a desperate need
by OPEC countries for oil export revenue and prices that still far
exceed production costs would drive prices down in both the short
and long term.

   Retailers wallowing through the second year of a damaging slump
will have at least one, brief shining moment to recall in 1988.
   Christmas shoppers crowded stores around the country Friday in a
post-Thanksgiving rush worthy of its traditional billing as the
busiest day of the year for merchants.
   Malls and downtowns were crowded early with people racing to snap
up electronic gear, Nintendo video games, cashmere sweaters,
customized luggage, Barbie dolls and kitchen appliances.
   Part of the spurt was credited to post-election relief among
consumers, but the main motivation came from the retailers
themselves, who tightened inventories and cooked up promotions in an
effort to reverse their sagging fortunes.
   The strategy led to warnings of shortages and to giveaways no
self-respecting shopper could resist.
   ``This is serious. I set my alarm for the first time in my life
to go shopping,'' said Lynn Loull, who arrived at Emporium-Capwell
in San Francisco at 8:40 a.m. ``It's going well. I've gotten four
people done in an hour-and-a-half.''
   The 7 a.m. shoppers at a K mart in suburban New Orleans included
Charlene Jones and her sons Nathaniel, 7, and Leonard, 5.
   ``I woke up the boys and said `Let's go,''' she said.
   Store managers around the country found customers lined up to
greet them when they opened the doors.
   ``There's stroller gridlock in places,'' said Susan Inskeep, 56,
who had brought her grandson to the Galleria Glendale in suburban
Los Angeles.
   In Boise, Idaho, where last month's opening of Boise Towne Square
ended residents' 20-year-long wait for a modern shopping mall,
crowds swelled to 60,000, double the average daily traffic.
   In Lexington, Ky., crowds were ``probably the best I've seen in
my 30 years with McAlpins,'' said Scott Overley of the regional
department store chain. ``It's just a blowout on everything.''
   While most retailers and industry analysts had predicted a modest
5 percent improvement in sales over last year, activity began
picking up after the elections earlier this month.
   Whether it was an expression of confidence in President-elect
Bush or just plain relief at having put politics to rest, spending
increased noticeably even before Thanksgiving.
   ``People have loosened up more,'' said Paul Lantz, floor manager
at Toys 'R' Us in Raleigh, N.C. ``They are feeling a little more
relaxed at this time.''
   They were anxious about the availability of popular gifts,
however.
   Melanie Bergeron of Bourg, La., traveled 90 minutes to a Toys R
Us looking for a toy grocery-store checkout scanner. She said she
hadn't known such a toy existed until her daughter asked for it, and
it wasn't in the stores in Houma, the city nearest her home.
   Retailers said they were well stocked for the surge, but they
also agreed close inventory control might stave off the disastrous
markdowns they were forced to make last Christmas.
   ``Our inventories are better fine-tuned than last year, which
should result in less of a panic-sale environment,'' said Gerald
Gura, president and chief executive officer of Cherry, Webb &
Touraine, a chain of retail fashion stores based in South Attleboro,
Mass.
   Stores also plied customers with inventive promotional gimmicks _
like early-bird sales, giveaways and visits from fairy-tale and
cartoon characters.
   In Florida, Maison Blanche stores advertised ``a CrackerJack of a
sale'' and gave away 4,500 boxes of CrackerJacks, some with diamond
rings or gift certificates inside.
   In Green Bay, Wis., more than a thousand people lined up before
sunrise for a 7 a.m. coupon giveaway at the H.C. Prange store.
   Elsewhere, Disney characters decorated the corridors of the
Cinderella City shopping mall in Englewood, Colo.; a mall in Jersey
City, N.J., beamed in the cartoon space family the Jetsons; and
Santa Claus showed up almost everywhere.
   The lure of Santa may have inflated the size of the crowds,
according to some skeptics. At Macy's in Manhattan, one of the
nation's largest shrines of the season, the toy department and Santa
Land were packed while traffic in the rest of the store appeared
light.
   ``Today we're just looking around and taking the kid to see Santa
Claus,'' said Louise Hickey, who was browsing through the Colonie
Center shopping mall in Albany, N.Y., with her husband and grandson.
``We'll do the heavy shopping later.''
   Layton Widner, manager of Wal-Mart in Decatur, Ala., said buying
was heading in a practical direction.
   ``People are buying the basics,'' he said. ``There are no hot
items in toys like the Cabbage Patch doll of previous years.''
