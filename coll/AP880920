<HEAD>Rio Seeks Federal Aid to Avoid Bankruptcy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rio de Janeiro wants $54 million
from the federal government to avoid bankruptcy, but federal
officials said Tuesday that bailing out this celebrated tourist
mecca would set a bad precedent.
   Presidential press spokesman Carlos Henrique Santos told
reporters that if President Jose Sarney helps Rio, ``the next day
there will be a line of 4,000 mayors knocking on the door of the
presidential palace.''
   Rio Mayor Roberto Saturnino Braga said last week that his city
of 5 million people was broke and could not pay its debts or the
salaries of 100,000 municipal employees unless Rio received federal
aid.
   Rio is Brazil's second-largest city and a major tourist
attraction. But Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega has refused the
city's request to issue $54 million in emergency bonds.
   Rio has been hurt in the last few decades by the transfer of the
federal capital to Brasilia and the flight of industry to Sao
Paulo, the nation's largest city.
   Today, Rio owes about $150 million to Brazilian creditors and
another $150 million in foreign debts. The city has projected a
budget deficit of close to $180 million this year.
   Saturnino Braga warned that the city may have to cut off school
lunches and medical supplies to city hospitals unless its credit is
extended.
   The mayor, a former economist who belongs to the fledgling
Brazilian Socialist Party, also said the city was considering
selling the Nelson Piquet Autodrome, named for its famous race car
driver and the site of the annual Brazilian Formula 1 Grand Prix.
   He predicted financial chaos unless the city received aid.
   ``There could be a deterioration of the city. Chaos. General
strikes, deterioration of public services and the conservation of
the city. But we'll do everything possible to avoid bankruptcy'' he
said in an interview over the weekend with the Jornal do Brasil
newspaper of Rio.

   Associated Press Writer=
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ At least 100,000 of America's children are
homeless on any given night and that doesn't include those who have
run away from home or been kicked out by their parents, the
National Academy of Sciences estimated Monday.
   While male alcoholics and former mental patients still make up a
large portion of the homeless, the fastest growing group of people
with no place to live are children under 18, said the academy's
Institute of Medicine.
   ``The committee feels strongly that the growing phenomenon of
homeless children is nothing short of a national disgrace that must
be treated with the urgency that such a situation demands,'' said
the report.
   One recommendation aimed directly at helping children: Federal
support for enriched day care and Head Start programs should be
expanded and coupled with outreach efforts to make homeless parents
aware of help available for their children.
   A recommendation for the homeless in general: Permit the use of
food stamps at restaurants so prepared meals will be available to
people who don't have kitchens.
   A controversy has erupted over the report, triggered by a
majority of the committee formed by the institute to do the study,
which was ordered by Congress.
   Ten of the 13 members of that panel, chaired by Bruce C.
Vladeck, the president of United Hospital Fund of New York in New
York City, endorsed a supplemental statement that the National
Academy of Sciences refused to publish in the report.
   The only mention of it appears in a footnote on page 136 of the
242-page book. It says, in part, that the committee members
``unanimously wish to express their strong feeling that the
recommendations are too limited in addressing the broader issues of
homelessness _ especially the supply of low-income housing, income
maintenance, the availability of support services, and access to
health care for the poor and uninsured.''
   Vladeck, interviewed Monday night by telephone, said he supports
the supplemental statement because the report as published, which
focuses on health and human needs of the homeless, ``doesn't
adequately convey our sense of outrage and dismay at the phenomenon
of homelessness.''
   He said the supplementary statement calls for three specifics:
   ``First, an expansion of federal support of low-income housing
to at least the 1981 budget levels from which they've been cut 70
percent since;
   ``Second, for development of a range of community-based
residential treatment services for the mentally ill and substance
abusers, and
   ``Third, for increasing the minimum wage to a level that makes
adequate housing affordable.''
   Dr. Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences,
blocked publication of the statement. He was quoted in Tuesday's
editions of The New York Times as saying he did so because ``the
language was charged and polemical and emotional.''
   ``The academy has a certain credibility to maintain and must
assure Congress and the executive branch that it will stick to the
data and minimize the intrusion of values as much as possible,''
Press said. ``This panel was so repelled by what they saw that they
wanted to go beyond their charge and give their views. We told them
that was not our process. If they wanted to do it, they had to do
it independently.''
   He said he was glad the members were issuing their statement but
said the main report was ``terrific as it stands.''
   In the report, the committee applauded changes that allow use of
food stamps at shelters and soup kitchens. But it said operators of
those facilities need to be educated in the principles of sound
nutrition and the special nutritional needs of the homeless.
   The committee also sought to dismiss fears of city government
officials who might conclude that increasing their efforts to help
the homeless would only draw more homeless people to their cities.
   The great majority of homeless people are long-term residents of
the city where they live, the committee said. What's more, it said,
what causes homeless people to move to another city is the prospect
for work, not the prospect for welfare. If jobs aren't available,
they tend not to stay long.
   As for homeless children, the report said there are no national
studies pinning down the numbers, but using ``even the most
conservative estimates'' would mean that:
   _On any given night, 735,000 people in America have no home in
which to sleep and must resort to streets, shelters, institutions
or other makeshift quarters. Citing research by the Alliance
Housing Council, a homeless advocacy group, the committee concluded
that 1.3 million to 2 million people will be homeless for one night
or more in the course of a year.
   _Most of the 735,000 homeless on any given night are alone, but
at least a quarter of them are members of families and 55 percent
of the family members are children.
   Thus, the report concludes, ``a minimum of 100,000 children are
homeless on any given night of the year'' and that figure counts
only children in intact families and leaves out ``runaway,
throwaway or abandoned children.''
   The study did not detail how it concluded that ``children under
the age of 18, usually as part of a family headed by a mother, are
the fastest growing group among the many subpopulations of the
homeless.''
   All statistics on the homeless are difficult to come up with,
the report acknowledged. In that connection, the Census Bureau
announced Monday that it will make a special effort in 1990 to
count the homeless. On March 20 of that year, census takers will
visit emergency shelters from 6 p.m. to midnight and street
locations where the homeless often congregate between 2 a.m. and 4
a.m.
   The report said most homeless children are in families headed by
the mother and it found that homeless mothers frequently have no
one to call on even in severe emergencies.
   It cited one Massachusetts study in which 43 percent of the
mothers could not name any one person to depend upon in a time of
stress ``and almost a quarter named their minor child as their
principal source of emotional support.''
   During 10 months of research, the committee and its staff
visited agencies serving the homeless in 11 cities _ Boston,
Chicago, Kansas City, Lexington, Ky., Los Angeles, Milwaukee,
Nashville, San Diego, San Francisco, St. Louis and Washington _ and
rural areas in Alabama, Minnesota, Mississippi and North Dakota.
   ``Those who stay in rural areas remain hidden until some event
causes them to lose their housing, at which point they can be found
living in, for example, cars, abandoned buildings, and woods,'' the
report said.
   The study says the major causes of homelessness are:
   _A decrease in the number of housing units for low-income people
_ 2.5 million fewer than in 1980 _ while the number of people who
can only affod such units has increased because of skyrocketing
housing costs.
   _A tightening of eligibility for public assistance programs as
well as a decline in the value of such assistance.
   _Policies of state mental hospitals, general hospitals,
rehabilitation facilities and some jails and prisons that have
fewer people admitted and free some who were previously held.
   ``One result of these factors is that the system for providing
temporary shelter for people who are homeless has been burdened
beyond its capacity,'' with people staying for months rather than
days, the report says.
   The study says health problems both cause and result from
homelessness.
   Alcoholism, drug abuse, mental illness and the fatal disease
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, often results in
people losing jobs and homes, it noted.
   Many diseases are complicated by homelessness and illnesses such
as exposure, hypothermia, skin disorders. In addition, accidents,
muggings and rapes are often the result of the victim having no
home, the study says.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the Nicaraguan
government and rebel leaders met for the first time in three months
Monday but broke off talks after failing to agree on a new location
for resuming peace negotiations.
   The rebel delegation rejected the government's demand that
future talks to end the 7-year-old civil war take place in the
Nicaraguan capital of Managua, rebel leader Roberto Ferrey said
after the meeting.
   The rebels proposed Guatemala, Costa Rica or the Dominican
Republic as alternative sites for high-level negotiations, Ferrey
said.
   Monday's meeting had been called as a preliminary step to
resuming the peace talks that collapsed June 9. The four-hour
session was the first meeting between the leftist government and
the U.S.-backed rebels since talks collapsed.
   A possible second day of talks on Tuesday was ruled out, and no
date for another meeting was announced.
   Ferrey said rebels were open to considering new proposals on a
location for the talks, and the government has said it would keep
trying to persuade the rebels to bargain in Managua.
   Ferrey said he reiterated a rebel proposal that high-level talks
be held Sept. 26-28, but not in Managua. The proposal was contained
in a letter he submitted to Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco, head of the government delegation, and was made
available to reporters.
   The rebels, known as Contras, also demanded the government
release more than 40 opposition demonstrators arrested in July and
guarantee freedom of expression as a precondition to further talks.
   Ferrey said that during previous talks in Managua, rebel leaders
``felt like prisoners in their own country'' and added, ``our
telephone conversations were listened to.'' He did not elaborate.
   In a separate press conference, Tinoco said the government was
sticking by its position that the talks be held in Managua.
   A fragile March 21 cease-fire remains in effect in Nicaragua,
but each side accuses the other of violating the truce.
   Tinoco had said before the meeting Monday he expected it to
result in ``a cease-fire for 30 or 60 days that could be extended
indefinitely.'' There was no announcement on extending the
cease-fire.
   Both sides had agreed on March 23 to seek a negotiated
settlement to the conflict the government says has claimed the
lives of 28,000 Nicaraguans.
   Tinoco said Monday that that agreement called for Managua as the
site of peace negotiations.
   The agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in
exchange for democratic reforms. Shortly before peace talks broke
off in June, the Sandinistas proposed a timetable for disarmament
and political reforms.
   But the Contras rejected the plan, saying it did not go far
enough. They demanded freedom for political prisoners and
democratic reforms in Nicaragua before disarming.
   Tinoco said the Sandinistas will urge that a cease-fire
verification commission funded by $10 million from congress be put
into operation. Commission members would include the
secretary-general of the Organization of American States, Joao
Baena Soares, and Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.
   Tinoco also reiterated the government's demand that the Contras
free 66 prisoners of war being held in Honduras.
   He blamed the Contras for ending peace talks on June 9. ``The
Contras broke them off to seek military aid in the United States
Congress,'' he said.
   Direct U.S. military aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29, and the
Contras have few bargaining chips left. Non-lethal U.S. aid to the
Contras is distributed only in Honduras.
   During the past four months, most of the rebel forces fled back
to base camps inside Honduras to receive new supplies of uniforms
and food.
   Contra sources say only 2,000 fighters remain inside Nicaragua
while more than 9,000 are holed up in isolated camps in eastern
Honduras.
   The cease-fire pact in March caused deep divisions within the
rebel ranks. Militant Contras, led by Enrique Bermudez, a former
colonel under the deposed Anastasio Somoza dictatorship, said the
agreement was tantamount to surrender.

candidate for U.S. Senate in Missouri in 1986, died Monday. He was
65.
   Staley owned Oren Staley Realty Inc., which has offices in St.

   The crucial Shatt al-Arab waterway must
remain under Iraqi control and cannot be used by Iran as a
negotiating tool in peace talks to end their 8-year-old war, Iraq's
foreign minister was quoted as saying Monday.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said the waterway, the delta of the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers and Iraq's sole outlet to the sea,
should remain under Iraqi control as ``a historical, logical, legal
and a just matter,'' according to the official Iraqi News Agency.
   Aziz, speaking at a press conference, said Iraq rejects what he
said was Iran's use of the waterway as a means to pressure Iraq in
the U.N.-mediated peace talks that started in Geneva on Aug. 25,
the agency reported.
   Iraq is demanding sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab estuary and
that the outlet be cleared of sunken ships and silt. Iran's first
wants to negotiate the withdrawal of both side's troops to
internationally recognized borders, the exchange of war prisoners
and a U.N. investigation to determine who started the war.
   The talks broke off Sept. 13 and are scheduled to resume in New
York in the first week of October.
   Aziz said that Iraq is committed to peace and that ``Iran would
bear the consequences for its insistence on its current position.''
   After the press conference, Aziz left Baghdad for Riyadh and
consultations with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia about the negotiations
and other ``issues of common interest,'' the news agency said.
   In a related development, the agency reported that President
Saddam Hussein met with his military field commanders Monday and
one item on the agenda was the possibility of changing the course
of the Shatt al-Arab.
   Press reports in the region have said Iraq is considering the
project to change the path of the waterway in case its talks with
Iran deadlock completely.

<TEXT>
   In the country's agricultural
heartland, old ingrained fears tinge the debate over the referendum
next month on Gen. Augusto Pinochet's presidency.
   For prosperous landowners, frightening memories of farm seizures
by leftist peasants in the early 1970s has helped push them solidly
into the pro-Pinochet camp.
   ``This is the fear we have, of returning to the past,'' said
Francisco Olea, owner of a 100-acre spread here in the country's
fertile Central Valley.
   But for struggling farm workers, the prospect of reprisal by
their bosses or local officials is keeping many from openly voicing
dissent. Some say resentment with Pinochet's authoritarian rule,
and with a hand-to-mouth existence, will find expression in the
ballot box.
   ``At least before there was work, and the worker had the right
to express his opinion,'' said laborer Ramon Arias, as he painted a
tractor by the roadside. Two farmhands with him made similar
comments, but refused to give their names.
   Chileans will decide Oct. 5 in a yes or no ballot on a new term
for Pinochet, the right-wing army commander who seized power in a
bloody 1973 coup and has already ruled longer than any previous
president.
   If a majority vote for him, he will remain as president until
1997, but the military junta that he has headed as the governing
body since 1973 will be disbanded. If he loses, open elections will
be held in a year and he must hand over power in 1990, when a new
Congress, two-thirds elected and one-third appointed, will go into
place.
   Farmowner Olea and others like him have benefited from an
export-oriented, free-market economic program carried out by
Pinochet's administration. Foreign sales of grapes and other fruit,
much of it grown in the Central Valley, have been booming. With
government credits and technological assistance, many farm owners
are expanding production and making solid profits.
   But they have not forgotten the chaotic, radical reform programs
launched by President Salvador Allende, a self-declared Marxist
elected in 1970 and toppled in the coup led by Pinochet three years
later.
   Olea's home and land were illegally seized by peasants. He
negotiated with them so he could live in his house, which also had
been taken over, while they worked his land as they liked.
   ``We lived through a savage lack of order,'' said Luis Aullet,
who is partner with his brother Cesar in a 70-acre farm. ``There
was no respect for your home, your land.''
   Cesar Aullet said the Allende government sent ``experts'' with
no knowledge of agriculture to supervise land reform programs.
``What we fear is (that kind of) ignorance,'' he said.
   The landowners said that, with the production boom, conditions
for farm workers were improving significantly.
   ``Manpower is becoming scarce, and there's competition in
salaries to attract workers,'' Cesar Aullet said. ``Anyone who
wants work can find it.''
   The Aullets said that at the height of the harvesting season,
workers could not be found for less than 1,000 pesos, about twice
the minimum legal daily wage and equivalent to about $4.
   Their positive vision of rural Chile is shared by Pinochet's
campaign strategists, who predict overwhelming voter support from
the heartland.
   Opposition leaders contend that the countryside's poor majority
are suffering economically and are eager for a change but won't say
so publicly because they fear losing their jobs or government
benefits, such as pensions and housing subsidies.
   The opposition's political campaign is aimed at overcoming such
fears, while recognizing them as legitimate. One prominent campaign
slogan in the countryside is ``Say yes, but vote no.''
   Several farm workers said harvesting jobs paid an average 700
pesos, or less than $3 a day, and lasted only a few months a year.
``You can't live on that,'' Arias said.
   Jorge Contreras, who sells bread from the back of his small,
battered truck in the countryside around San Fernando, said most of
his customers opposed Pinochet's continued rule.
   ``I travel 50 kilometers (30 miles) a day, and I can tell you
there are a lot more people for the `no' vote than the `yes'
vote,'' he said.
   But he added: ``Lots of people may vote `yes' because they're
afraid.'' He said that in one remote town on his bread route,
Tinguiririca Alto, ``people are telling each other that if you vote
`no,' you'll be arrested.''
   The government has said the vote will be secret, and the
opposition has publicized its plans to have representatives at each
polling place to prevent intimidation.

   Teddy Roosevelt skips across the stage, bullying
subordinates and singing his joy at another war. Commodore George
Dewey orders the beginning of the Battle of Manila Bay to a Latin
jazz accompaniment.
   ``Manifest Destiny: An Evening of Yankee Panky,'' opening
Wednesday in New York for a five-show run, is the unlikeliest of
musicals _ a bittersweet history of America's 1898 takeover of the
Philippines, written by that nation's foreign secretary, Raul
Manglapus.
   Inspired by the musical ``1776,'' which ran on Broadway from
1969 to 1971, Manglapus wrote ``Yankee Panky'' 14 years ago, while
on a self-imposed exile from the authoritarian rule of President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``He thought a musical would be a painless way to show a
neglected part of our nation's history,'' said his son Francis, who
is producing the play. ``He really researched it. The information
that he gained for the play he's really using right now.''
   ``Right now'' refers to Manglapus' protracted negotiations with
Washington over the future of U.S. military bases in the islands.
He was appointed foreign secretary last year by President Corazon
Aquino.
   As a negotiator, Manglapus has demanded a steep increase in the
amount of U.S. aid in exchange for continued use of the bases, the
largest U.S. military complex on foreign soil.
   As a playwright, he provides an insight into why some Filipinos
consider the military outposts an odious vestige of American rule.
   In ``Yankee Panky,'' U.S. diplomats beguile Philippine rebels,
promising them arms, support and independence if they defeat the
Spanish colonialists, but offering no written guarantees.
Straw-hatted American businessmen plot to wean Filipinos from fruit
juices to soft drinks and create new U.S. export markets.
   The garrulous Roosevelt is portrayed nearly to satiric excess,
smoking cigars, grinning and barking: ``I say you can't civilize
without the use of force.''
   With a score that ranges from Tin Pan Alley to bossa nova,
``Yankee Panky'' explores the broken promises, the bloody
suppression of a Philippine war of independence in 1899-1901 and
the battle for the Philippine mind that ensued. The nation finally
gained independence in 1946.
   ``The goal of this play is to destroy certain myths that people
still cling to,'' Francis Manglapus said during a rehearsal.
   ``There's this myth that the United States has a `special
relationship' with the Philippines. The United States is not
looking out for our interests; it is looking out for its
interests.''
   Manglapus wrote the play while on a Ford Foundation Fellowship
to study Philippine-American relations from 1898 to 1902.
   A musical was a natural vehicle for the 69-year-old Manglapus.
At home on the piano, xylophone and drums, he had written songs to
cheer fellow prisoners of the Japanese in World War II. Later he
led a Manila Dixieland band _ The Executives _ that jammed with
Lionel Hampton and Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia, a part-time jazz
clarinetist.
   Francis Manglapus and director Steve Pudenz tried to stage
``Yankee Panky'' in 1980, ``but the Philippines wasn't front-page
news then,'' the younger Manglapus said.
   After Marcos was toppled, ``Yankee Panky'' became a success in
Manila, and a recent crop of political plays on Broadway encouraged
Manglapus and Pudenz to take a plunge in New York.
   Its 35-member cast performs traditional Philippine dances and
sings lyrics that range from superficial (``To spread civilization;
To improve sanitation'') to savage (``They like to play the
democrat; And never teach the little brown brat.'')
   Pudenz hopes its run at the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the
Divine in New York is a prelude for another presentation in
Washington.
   ``We would love to do it in Washington, so that the State
Department and Congress could see it, and understand a little bit
more,'' Pudenz said.

<TEXT>
   American Greg Louganis won his second
consecutive Olympic gold medal in men's springboard diving Tuesday
just a day after he hit the back of his head on the board.
   Sporting a bare spot on his head, Louganis gave a picturesque
performance and knocked off two Chinese challengers.
   He finished with 730.80. Tan Liangde of China, runner-up to
Louganis at the 1984 Summer Games, had 704.88 to win the silver
medal and Li Deliang of China finished with 665.28 to take the
bronze.
   The other American, Mark Bradshaw, came in fifth with 652.99,
behind Albin Killat of West Germany who had 661.47 points.
   The dive that marred Louganis' performance in Monday's
preliminaries caused him no problem Tuesday. The reverse
2{-somersault in the pike position earned three 9s, three 8.5s and
one 8. In the preliminaries, he received two zeros, one .5, three
1s, one 1.5 and five stitches.
   Louganis, 28, is seeking to become the first man to win both the
springboard and platform events in consecutive Olympics. He
captured his first Olympic medal in 1976 when, at the age of 16, he
finished second in the platform competition.

   The race for U.S. Senate between GOP
incumbent David Karnes and Democratic challenger Bob Kerrey has
been disrupted by a third-party candidate, a maverick legislator
who was nominated at a convention held in a fast-food restaurant.
   Kerrey, a former one-term governor who is leading in the polls,
boycotted Sunday what was to have been the second of eight campaign
debates after organizers agreed to include state Sen. Ernie
Chambers, candidate of the left-wing New Alliance Party.
   Kerrey said Monday he would engage in future debates with Karnes
only if the incumbent barred Chambers and renounced the New
Alliance Party, which Kerrey characterized as a fringe group bent
on disrupting the political process.
   ``The issue is whether the New Alliance Party deserves to be in
our debates,'' Kerrey said. ``I have said no. I have said that a
party of 14 members, that holds its nominating convention in Booth
No. 2 at Denny's Restaurant should not be included.''
   Karnes called Chambers a legitimate candidate who had a right to
participate in the debates. But on Monday, Karnes said he would
``not be debating any further'' and blamed Kerrey for the breakdown.
   ``Bob Kerrey is the debate-buster in this campaign,'' he said.
``I believe Kerrey has accomplished his goal of destroying the
debate process. I do not believe it will do me any good to
continue.''
   The first debate certainly did Karnes little good. Speaking at
the State Fair in Lincoln on Sept. 5, he was booed when he said
``we need fewer farmers.'' Karnes, who in one of his commercials
picks up a bale of hay and is described as the farmer-senator, said
the remark was a slip of the tongue.
   Karnes, a lawyer for an Omaha grain company, was plucked from
political obscurity in 1986 when newly elected GOP Gov. Kay Orr
chose him to succeed Democratic Sen. Edward Zorinsky, who died of a
heart attack.
   Analysts believe Karnes stands to gain from Chambers' candidacy.
Chambers, who is black, is very popular in the predominantly
low-income, Democratic-voting North Omaha district he has
represented in the Legislature for 18 years. Blacks make up about
12 percent of Omaha's population and there are few blacks in the
state outside its largest city.
   Chambers, a barber, has a long history of controversy in
Nebraska politics. While most state senators wear suits on the
floor of the Legislature, Chambers wears a sweat shirt and blue
jeans. He once called Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi a ``great man''
and said President Reagan was ``a Rambo-esque character in the last
stages of senility.''
   Chambers acknowledged that his candidacy could hurt Kerrey, but
added, ``It would be a mistake, it would diminish me as a person
and the significance of what I'm about, to say I'm running this
race to stop Bob Kerrey,'' Chambers said.
   ``I want to stop both of them _ I want to win.''
   But stopping the Democrats nationally is an avowed goal of the
New Alliance Party, a black-led organization that describes itself
as multiracial, leftist, opposed to Contra aid and nuclear weapons
and favoring more rights for women and homosexuals.
   In Omaha last week, New Alliance presidential candidate Lenora
Fulani said her campaign sought to ``dump Dukakis.''
   ``It would give me great joy to spoil for a party that has come
into the Afro-American community and other communities in this
county and taken our vote, taken our hope, taken our desire and
turned it into a Dukakis-Lloyd Bentsen ticket,'' Ms. Fulani said.
   An Omaha World-Herald poll released Sunday showed Kerrey favored
by 51 percent of the 755 registered voters questioned by telephone
statewide Sept. 14-16. Karnes was favored by 33 percent and
Chambers had 4 percent. Eleven percent said they were undecided.
The poll had a margin of error of 3.6 percent.
   Ironically, Kerrey was the original New Alliance Senate nominee.
In the May 10 primary, the former governor received 20 New Alliance
write-in votes and Chambers finished fourth with five votes. Kerrey
declined the nomination, and Chambers was chosen in July at a state
convention held at a Denny's Restaurant.
   Chambers, who also was running unopposed for re-election to his
seat in the Legislature, accepted the nomination. After the courts
ruled he could not run for two offices simultaneously, Chambers
elected to remain on the Senate ballot and said he would mount a
write-in legislative campaign.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II's 10-day swing through
Africa has paradoxically served to reduce the stigma of any future
visit to South Africa, while firmly including the Vatican as a
player in efforts to solve the region's conflicts.
   An unexpected touchdown in Johannesburg, involvement in a
hostage drama in Lesotho, and quiet diplomacy to nudge Mozambique
and South Africa away from confrontation marked a trip which
initially had only the trappings of the fourth papal pastoral visit
to the continent.
   ``You could say it was an act of grace,'' commented Vatican
Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli, pondering the consequences
after bad weather forced a landing in South Africa, the very
country whose racial policies the pope excoriated at his first
touchdown in Zimbabwe.
   Before John Paul's visit to Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho,
Swaziland and Mozambique, some bishops and African leaders urged
him to strike the nation of apartheid from any future travel, but
by the time the pope landed in Rome Monday night, few voices
against a future stopover had been raised.
   Even the Rev. Allan Boesak, the Protestant anti-apartheid leader
who attended a papal ecumenical papal meeting in Maputo,
Mozambique, stopped short of discouraging a trip, despite his
charges that the pope had been too soft on the white minority
government.
   Vatican prelates confirmed the pope would fly to Madagascar and
Tanzania in 1989, and that he was considering a visit to rigidly
Marxist Angola.
   A customary Vatican procedure is to include countries of the
same region on one trip, making the prospect of a South Africa trip
in the near future a distinct possibility.
   After all, the pope had now landed at Jan Smuts airport, sipped
tea with Foreign Minister Pik Botha, ridden 190 miles in a
bulletproof government sedan, stopped for refreshments at an
Afrikaner gas station and visited people injured in the storming in
Lesotho of a hijacked bus, during which six people were killed by
South African commandos.
   The pope, who has rarely held back from sensitive subjects on
his foreign tours, continued to speak out:
   _He lectured the 20-year-old king of Swaziland and his four
wives about polygamy.
   _He repeatedly nudged Mozambique's Marxist government,
overwhelmed by 6 million people on the edge of famine and by the
ravages of a civil war, to sit down at the negotiating table with
rebels, offering the church's help if needed.
   The latter subject was all the more delicate since President
Joaquim Chissano's government until recently held on to confiscated
church property, while the Mozambique Resistance Movement _ a
shadowy group holding much of the country _ tried to depict itself
to the Vatican and the outside world as anti-communist, and thus in
favor of religious freedom.
   John Paul set his own agenda in some of the most graphic
speeches of any papal trip, exclaming: ``Yes, my beloved brothers,
I have felt the heart of this country bleed ... I am taking home
images of suffering ... the worried gaze of many children, the look
of uncertainty of so many youths, the tired eyes of so many adults
and the sad look of the aged.''
   Becoming unusually specific, he has permitted Mozambican bishops
to encourage negotiations between the government and rebels, while
backing a government program of amnesty which has already convinced
2,000 rebels to lay down their weapons.
   ``The pope's trip was like rain on scorched earth,'' commented
Nampula Bishop Dom Manuel Vieira Pinto, saying it marked a turning
point in church-state relations.
   On the government side, Jose Luis Cabaco, head of the ruling
FRELIMO party's foreign relations department, said Mozambique could
endorse practically everything the pope had recommended.
   Cabaco added that the government also felt encouraged by the
Vatican in Mozambique's efforts to revive a non-aggression pact and
economic cooperation with South Africa and by the pope's worldwide
appeal for aid.
   According to diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the
Vatican _ as it has done in the case of Poland and other countries
_ is dangling the prospect of formal diplomatic relations with
Mozambique as an incentive for it to continue supporting the
regional peace process and the thaw in religious freedom.

<HEAD>Rebel-Ordered Transport Ban Largely Heeded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vast majority of bus and
truck drivers heeded a nationwide transportation ban called by
leftist rebels despite assurances from the military that traffic
would be protected.
   Only a handful of mass transit buses circulated Monday in this
capital of 1 million inhabitants, forcing workers to walk to their
jobs or pay inflated fares to pickup truck and van owners.
   More than 70 percent of urban bus traffic was halted and
inter-city service was even more severely curtailed, an official of
the bus owners' association told The Associated Press.
   A dispatcher at one of San Salvador's two terminals said 90
percent of the bus service between provinces was stopped.
   The indefinite ban on bus and truck traffic was the fifth called
this year by Marxist-led guerrillas waging a nearly 9-year-old war
against the U.S.-backed government. Previous rebel bans lasted
three days each.
   The government urged citizens to ignore Monday's ban, saying the
military would protect vehicles.
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, the army chief of operations, told YSU
radio that about 13,000 soldiers were providing and protecting
transport.
   ``We refuse to allow a violent minority to impose its will on
us,'' he said.
   Soldiers rode shotgun aboard several state-owned buses
circulating in the capital and some army trucks carried passengers
to and from the city outskirts.
   Lorgio DeLeon, a 48-year-old father of six, was stranded at the
eastern bus terminal with no way to get to his tailor's job in
Zacatecoluca, 35 miles southeast of San Salvador.
   ``This hurts the poor worker more than anyone. We don't work
today, we get our pay docked,'' he said.
   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said the
ban was in response to the actions of riot troops who broke up a
Sept. 13 demonstration by leftist university students.
   The troops used tear gas and clubs and fired shots in the air to
disperse nearly 3,000 students at that protest. About 250
demonstrators were arrested.
   All but 14 were subsequently released, with the remainder
charged with what the government called ``terrorist acts.''

   The 17 members of a British Airways crew got caught up in the
hurricane at Kingston's Pegasus Hotel. The morning after, they took
over the duties of hotel staffers, most of whom were unable to get
to work. In return for free meals, flight attendants and cockpit
crew waited tables, washed dishes, tended bar and lugged suitcases
up to guests' rooms for a full day. For burser Richard Evans, the
toughest part was washing dishes, pots and pans ``piled to the
ceiling'' with no hot water. The answer was to use a little lime
juice.

   Power failure knocked out traffic lights in Kingston, and
driving in the city of 750,000 inhabitants became a risky business.
You nose into the road and hope oncoming cars stop and let you in.
If they don't, you just wait. At one especially busy intersection,
a fellow wearing a bright red shirt and flowered bermuda shorts

   Along with winds reaching 145 mph, Hurricane Gilbert dumped up
to 10 inches of rain on Jamaica, swelling rivers and reservoirs.
But a week after the storm, water was in dangerously short supply
because electricity had not been restored to most pumping and
filtration stations. In Kingston, people gathered at burst water
mains and open hydrants. In the countryside, roads were lined with
people trudging behind wooden carts loaded with jugs and buckets
filled with water. Women balanced plastic containers on their
heads. Health officials warned against taking water from rivers and
streams that could be contaminated by the carcasses of animals.
Millions of water-purification tablets were being airlifted into
the country.

   Twelve families were sheltering at Woodbourne Seventh-day
Adventist Church in St. Thomas Parish, one of the four eastern
Jamaican districts hardest hit by the hurricane. They told how the
winds demolished their homes and furniture and and wiped out their
meager farms. A slightly built teen-age boy was asked if he had
anything to say. ``I feel frightened, sir,'' he said. ``We don't
have anyplace to live.'' It seemed cruel to ask him anything else.

<HEAD>Tighter Controls Needed on Dairy Promotion Program, Audit Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national dairy promotion program financed by
dairy farmers should be tightened to eliminate slipshod accounting
methods, waste and unauthorized use of funds, an Agriculture
Department audit says.
   The report by the USDA's office of inspector general criticized
the Agricultural Marketing Service, which administers the program,
for not providing adequate guidelines and controls over those
sharing in the funds, and for submitting incomplete information to
Congress.
   ``AMS' annual report to Congress did not include information
relating to approximately 60 percent of the activities of the
program,'' the auditors said. ``Congress had not been informed as
to the accountability of approximately $374.4 million of $619.7
million of the Dairy Promotion Program assessments for the
three-year period ending April 30, 1987.''
   The inspector general's office said it was looking into at least
one case of possible fraud. However, it declined to provide details
and said only that a report on the investigation would be issued
later.
   The program was created by Congress in a 1983 law that imposes a
mandatory assessment of 15 cents for each 100 pounds of milk
produced and marketed in the 48 contiguous states. Producers may
assign up to 10 cents of the assessment to regional or state
qualified programs, or QPs, that have similar promotional projects.
   But at least 5 cents of the assessment must be sent to the
National Dairy Promotion and Research Board, or National Dairy
Board, which consists of 36 dairy farmers appointed by the
secretary of agriculture.
   The board finances national promotional programs, including
television commercials, to help sell more milk and other dairy
products, all subject to review by AMS officials.
   According to the report, which has been circulating recently
within the dairy industry and the department, auditors looked into
the use of program funds during the period of May 1985 through May
1987 and ``other periods as deemed necessary.''
   During that period, approximately 291 billion pounds of milk
were marketed, with an assessment of around $436.9 million, of
which almost $168.2 million was remitted to the national board and
$268.7 million credited to the QPs.
   The audit report said:
   _Five of the 18 QPs reviewed passed $14.7 million of $15.6
million in assessment funds collected to other QPs and incurred
approximately $235,000 in administrative costs.
   _Two other QPs improperly used $106,500 for activities such as
school activity funds, athletic tournaments, support of veterinary
services, the National Future Farmers of America Foundation and
other miscellaneous accounts.
   _Five QPs with assessments funds totaling about $20.5 million
had internal control weaknesses such as separation of duties,
management of promotional materials and procurement systems.
   _Four QPs incurred $2.4 million in administrative costs in
excess of the 5 percent limit set by the National Dairy Board.
   ``In the absence of guidelines concerning the use of the
assessment funds, the QPs and an affiliated organization, the
United Dairy Industry Association (of Rosemont, Ill.), had only
their discretion to follow,'' the report said.
   Auditors said they questioned the association's classification
of ``about $5.8 million of administrative costs as program costs,
$1,500 in monthly per diem to the UDIA's chairman of the board of
directors and $85 per diem per day in excess of travel-related
expenses to members of the UDIA board.''
   The report recommended a general tightening up of procedures,
including accounting by the QPs on how the money is spent. Also,
the department's Agricultural Marketing Service should ``devise and
implement guidelines'' that organizations must follow before
getting any funds.
   In its comments, the AMS agreed to some of the audit report's
recommendation but said its authority on others was limited and
that action by Congress may be required.
   ``If the department concludes that such additional oversight is
desirable, AMS would be willing to discuss'' with Congress the
purpose and legislative intent of the law authorizing the dairy
promotion program, the marketing service said.

   When it comes to curbing the cotton boll
weevil, it's a matter of timing and tillage rather than how much
pesticide is used, the Agriculture Department says.
   A seven-year study in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas led
to a new state law last year that requires farmers to destroy
cotton stalks by Sept. 15. By shredding the stalks and then
following up with deep plowing, the destructive weevils are
deprived of winter shelter and food when they are dormant.
   Entomologist Kenneth R. Summy of the department's Agricultural
Research Service says in a report that the Rio Grande study showed
that farmers applied pesticides 15 times to 18 times a year in 1980
and 1981.
   But in 1984, following a year of ``moderate'' stalk destruction,
chemicals only had to be applied three or four times, he said. From
1985 to 1987, pesticide use rose again, sometimes equaling 1981
levels, because farmers didn't destroy the cotton stalks.
   Last year the Texas legislature passed the law requiring cotton
growers to destroy stalks annually by Sept. 15 in the Rio Grande
zone, later in other parts of the state.
   To help state officials enforce stalk destruction, USDA
scientists worked out a surveillance system for cotton fields by
using infrared aerial photos to detect which fields are not plowed
by the deadline, Summy said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ An upsurge in atrocities not seen
in Haiti since the terror of the 29-year Duvalier dynasty appears
to have triggered an army revolt that toppled the government of Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Some see an opening for democratic reforms under Haiti's new
leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who announced on nationwide
television Sunday that he was assuming the presidency ``to save the
country from anarchy and chaos.''
   But a Haitian government official said privately that Avril may
be thwarted by the military high command, which the official said
``is not favorable to an opening toward the civilian sector and
wants to maintain its privileges.''
   Before the coup, Avril was the army's adjutant general.
   Soldiers of the elite, 1,000-man Presidential Guard ousted
Namphy and sent him to neighboring Dominican Republic early Sunday
after several hours of sporadic gunfire that apparently caused no
casualties. At least six people were reported killed, however, in
what were described as reprisals against alleged Tonton Moucoutes
thugs blamed for recent atrocities.
   In justifying the coup, Sgt. Joseph Heubreux said the
noncommissioned officers who led it wanted to restore honor to the
army and ``raise the prestige of the Haitian people degraded by so
many acts which have revolted the conscience of the Haitian people
and the world.''
   It was Heubreux who appeared on television here to introduce
Avril as the new president of this impoverished Caribbean island
nation.
   Under Namphy, Haiti experienced increased random killings and
intimidation of groups advocating democratic reform.
   In the worst recent outrage, about 20 hoodlums brandishing
machetes, handguns and steel pikes burst into a Roman Catholic
church during Mass on Sept. 11 and slaughtered 13 people.
Seventy-seven others were wounded.
   The toughs were identified as City Hall workers, and Namphy and
Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain were widely blamed for the
attack.
   Romain is thought to be a leader of a Macoutes faction. He
reportedly was arrested at the presidential palace shortly before
the coup, then taken to the Dominican Embassy. He remained there
Monday, seeking political asylum and awaiting an exit visa.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
church massacre was the apparent trigger for dissident
noncomissioned officers who felt they were not getting proper pay
and recognition.
   Avril had helped Namphy overthrow the 4-month-old civilian
government of President Leslie Manigat in a bloodless coup on June
19.
   The diplomat said of the dissident sergeants: ``Under Manigat
they felt slighted and snubbed. Under Namphy, they did not receive
the material signs of recognition they expected. And on top of
that, the atrocity ... (Sept. 11) must have affected them as
men-of-the-people.''
   Among 19 demands the Presidential Guard presented to the
military high command on Sunday was a call for democracy, with free
elections.
   It was uncertain whether the high command would agree to any
democratic reforms.
   Avril's pledge to take part in a dialogue with opposition
parties was generally welcomed, but popular politician Sylvio
Claude, the Christian Democratic Party leader, remained skeptical.
   According to Claude, Avril ``is known as a Duvalierist, and all
Duvalierists are criminals.''
   Avril has been closely identified with the Duvalier regimes
since the early 1960s, when he took part in the struggle against
anti-Duvalierist guerrillas. Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier
destroyed the political power of the army in the 1960s with his
private militia of thugs, popularly known as Tonton Macoutes. Upon
his death his son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, succeeded him
in 1971.
   After the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier in February 1986, Avril
was briefly an adviser to the junta headed by Namphy. Avril was
dismissed in March 1986 after popular protest demonstrations
against him.
   Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council of
Hemispheric Affairs, said the key to the future course of Haitian
politics lies with Col. Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the feared
700-man Dessalines Barracks.
   The military high command was said to be resisting efforts by
the Presidential Guard to elevate Paul to armed forces commander in
chief.
   Paul has been indicated on drug trafficking charges by a federal
court in Florida. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in
Washington on Monday that making Paul army commander ``would
certainly give us an indication of the difficulties we will have
with this government if he is appointed.''
   Birns said, ``Although skeptical that democracy is near in
Haiti, I think it (the coup) is a hopeful sign. Namphy's rule had
degenerated into a highly eccentric and dangerous mode and
something had to be done to get rid of him.''
   ``Curiously enough, in recent weeks, Jean-Claude Paul ... has
established close working relations with some democratic figures in
Haiti'' and soldiers from the Dessalines Barracks had been sent to
guard Catholic churches recently.
   ``Of course, all these people (jockeying for authoritarian
power) are thugs,'' Birns said. ``It's a question of relativity.''

<HEAD>Walesa Making Remarkable Comeback In Official Media</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who was
virtually ignored by Polish newspapers and television for the past
seven years, is suddenly staging a remarkable comeback in the
state-controlled media.
   Two official publications last week ran interviews of Walesa, a
newspaper printed a detailed profile of him, Radio Polonia
broadcast his words to its foreign audiences, and most state-run
newspapers had front-page headlines last week such as, ``Kiszczak
(the interior minister) Meets Walesa.''
   While Walesa is not quite yet a media celebrity in Poland, his
name is getting into print again for the first time since martial
law was imposed in 1981. The change comes as the official press has
begun to push the line that greater dialogue is needed to solve the
country's problems.
   Publication of the first interview Thursday, in the September
issue of the monthly Confrontations, followed Walesa's agreement to
end a wave of August strikes in return for the promise of a meeting
with government officials that could lead to restoring his union's
legal status.
   Walesa, in the interview, called for legalization of Solidarity
and for loosening central controls on the economy, politics and
society.
   ``There must be Solidarity'' he said of the union which was
suppressed under the martial-law crackdown of Dec. 13, 1981 and
outlawed the following year. He added that Solidarity could not
function solely as a trade union until ``social and political
pluralism also gets into the act in earnest.''
   Asked about the recent negotiations with Interior Minister
Czeslaw Kiszczak, he said: ``It is either a big game in which you
try to outmaneuver Walesa once again, or it is really the opening
of a new chapter in Polish history. I hope the latter is right.''
   He called on Poland to abandon centralized economic planning and
embrace a system to ``create possibilities.'' He added: ``Only in
pluralism can I see a chance for progress and better living. As
responsible people we should discuss how to leave behind a model
which has not stood the test.''
   Adam Kowalski, deputy editor of Confrontations, said the editors
felt ``satisfaction, joy'' when they submitted the interview and
got approval from the Censorship Office to publish it.
   Walesa spoke to the two reporters at his home on Sept. 1, the
same day he ended a strike at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk. The two
journalists also published a version of the interview in another
magazine, Reporter.
   State-owned Radio Polonia, which beams official propaganda in 10
languages to other countries around the world, devoted six minutes
Friday of its daily half-hour broadcasts to a Walesa interview, a
station spokesman said.
   In the broadcast, Walesa said both he and the government had
learned something during the past seven years.
   ``You are the first Polish journalists of the officially
published press since December 13, 1981, to ask me for an
interview,'' Walesa was quoted in the opening line of the
Confrontations piece.
   The sudden attention to Walesa does not suit all Poles. After
all, for years Walesa was referred to _ when at all _ only
negatively, as a private person, as a former leader of a former
union or as a tool of foreign powers.
   ``I think that Gen. Kiszczak should not talk to Mr. Walesa
because Mr. Walesa is just the same kind of citizen as all of us,''
said one man interviewed on the street by state television Saturday.

<HEAD>Study Says Many People Can't Collect On Nursing Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six out of 10 people with private nursing home
insurance are likely to receive no benefits because of restrictions
on their policies, says a study released today by the United
Seniors Health Cooperative.
   The study by the consumer advocacy group concludes ``many of the
policies now being offered for sale ... are not likely to pay
adequate benefits if and when people need them.''
   While there may be a role for the private insurance industry in
filling the national need for long-term care protection, ``this
role should not include selling bad policies to unsuspecting
consumers,'' the study said.
   Jim Firman, president of the Washington-based group, and William
Weissert, director of the program on aging at the University of
North Carolina, conducted the study. They based their findings on
an analysis of 77 typical private long-term health care insurance
plans offered by 21 companies.
   The most common restriction, found in 77 percent of the plans,
was that a person must first be hospitalized for his or her
condition before being allowed to collect benefits for subsequent
nursing home care.
   ``Fifty-four percent of nursing home admissions do not come
directly from a hospital and will not qualify for coverage under a
plan with this restriction,'' the report said.
   The other major limitation, included in 40 percent of the plans,
said people must first receive skilled-level nursing home care
before they can qualify for lower levels of long-term care. Such a
requirement excludes 46 percent of nursing home residents, the
study said.
   ``The effect of these exclusions is even more dramatic and
troubling'' when combined with waiting periods and other
restrictions, the report said. ``The average probability of not
collecting benefits... was 61 percent, if you are admitted to a
nursing home.''
   Although 95 percent of the plans studied said they cover
patients with Alzheimer's disease, the researchers said 81 percent
of the plans contain the two major restrictions regarding
hospitalization and skilled care.
   ``Given the long duration and deteriorating characteristics of
Alzheimer's disease, it is likely that for much of the patient's
period of illness, these restrictions would preclude eligibility
for coverage,'' they said.
   The study said the most common type of nursing home coverage is
a $50-a-day indemnity benefit _ an amount it labeled ``grossly
inadequate'' to meet the expected costs of care.
   If someone purchased such a plan now and entered a nursing home
in 20 years, the study said, out-of-pocket costs could reach up to
$130,000 if the plan had no inflation protection. Two-thirds of the
companies studied did not offer inflation protection.
   ``For most people who are in a nursing home for a long period of
time, the effect of most of the plans we studied will be to delay
but not to prevent eventual impoverishment,'' the researchers said.
   Fifty-six of the plans studied offered home health care
coverage, but substantial restrictions ``make it unlikely that most
persons in need of home care will collect significant benefits,''
the study said.
   The most common restriction is requiring a prior covered nursing
home confinement before a policy-holder can tap into home care
benefits. Other plans require only prior hospitalization, according
to the report.
   Several lawmakers have introduced long-term care insurance
schemes involving the federal government or joint public-private
efforts; Congress is expected to consider the matter seriously next
year.

<HEAD>Census Planning Special Homeless Count</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special effort to count the nation's
homeless will be conducted as part of the 1990 Census.
   Cynthia Taeuber of the Census Bureau said Monday that officials
have decided to hold a separate count, a few days before the
regular national census, in an effort to count those living on the
streets and in shelters.
   The homeless have become an increasingly visible part of
American society, but there are no concrete estimates of their
numbers.
   On March 20, 1990, Census takers will visit emergency shelters,
both public and private, and will go to various street locations
which have been identified as places the homeless congregate, said
Taeuber.
   The street search for the homeless will be conducted from 2 a.m.
to 4 a.m., and shelters will be visited from 6 p.m. to midnight,
she said.
   Census officials will be working with various groups and
agencies that serve as advocates for the homeless, explained
Taeuber, in order to determine in advance where to look for these
people.
   In addition, the agency will encourage people with those groups,
and the homeless themselves, to work as enumerators in the count.
However, these workers will have to pass the same written exams and
other criteria as all Census workers.
   Census day for most of the nation is April 1, 1990. The count of
the homeless is being taken a few days early, however, because many
shelters close at the end of March or beginning of April, Taeuber
said.
   She added that the Census Bureau will not try to define who
constitutes a homeless person. Instead it will merely issue counts
of people living on the streets and those staying in various types
of shelters.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Senate Barbers Shaved Senators _ and Taxpayers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shave and a haircut used to cost nothing, if
you were a United States senator and were shaved and trimmed in the
United States Senate barber shop.
   And when one reform-minded senator tried to eliminate free
senatorial shaving and hair cutting 37 years ago, his
shaved-for-free colleagues rebelled.
   The senator was the late Paul Douglas of Illinois, and his
experience was recalled in a recent Senate speech by Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Douglas had gone to the Senate barber shop for a haircut.
   ``After the barber had done his work,'' said Dole, ``Douglas
began to think that his income was ample enough to pay for his own
haircut _ which then cost a dollar and a quarter _ and not charge
it to the taxpayer.''
   So Douglas introduced an amendment to the annual legislative
appropriations act to cut off funds for the barber shop unless it
began charging senators for its services.
   The counterattack was not long coming.
   At a Senate hearing, Sen. Carl Hayden of Arizona complimented
Douglas on his haircut, then recalled that the haircut issue was
one that flared from time to time.
   Hayden said that when he first came to the Senate he became
disturbed at newspaper articles complaining about free senatorial
haircuts and discussed the matter with Senate veteran William Borah
of Idaho.
   ``Senator Borah said, `You tell that reporter to go to the
devil. I want the same service that was received here by Henry Clay
and John C. Calhoun.'''
   Dole picked up the story, saying, ``After a good laugh, the
Senate shouted down Senator Douglas' amendment, and the free
haircut survived.''
   But only for the monent.
   ``I want to assure taxpayers that today senators pay their own
way when they have their hair cut, as Senator Douglas tried and
failed to accomplish 37 years ago,'' Dole said.
   While they pay more than a dollar and a quarter, the Senate
barbering charges may be a bit gentler than those of most
commercial barbershops.
   The current charge for a haircut in the Senate barbershop is
$4.50.
   More elaborate cuts are $6.50. Hair styling costs $9.00.
   A shave costs $4.00.

   ``At this time I would would like to recognize for eight minutes
the chairman of the awesome and powerful Ways and Means Committee,
one of the most distinguished leaders that we have in this
Congress, Mr. Rostenkowski from Illinois.''
   ``The awesome chairman is recognized,'' said Rep. Bob Carr,

<HEAD>US, Allies Try To Slow Argentine, Brazilian, North Korean Missiles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its industrial allies
are trying to slow the development of missiles in Argentina, Brazil
and North Korea and hope to have the cooperation of the Soviet
Union in the global campaign against proliferation.
   The State Department confirmed on Monday that the seven allies,
meeting in Rome Sept. 8-9, exchanged expressions of concern about
missile proliferation and technology transfers that might enhance
Argentina's capability.
   Afterward, a U.S. official told The Associated Press the same
group registered concern in its deliberations about programs in
Brazil and North Korea.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Secretary of State George P. Shultz may pursue the problem with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze during their talks
in Washington on Thursday and Friday.
   In any event, the official said, Assistant Secretary of State H.
Allen Holmes will take up the issue at talks in Washington next
week with Viktor P. Karpov, senior Soviet arms control negotiator.
   North Korea's attempt to extend the range of its Scud B missile
should demonstrate to the Soviets the proliferation problem extends
to their region, the official said.
   Brazil's attempt to develop the Sonda IV missile is the other
program the United States discussed with representatives of
Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan, the
official said.
   ``It was an attempt to keep everybody up to date in the area,''
the official said. ``They did not adopt any special program. That's
not the way it works.''
   Meanwhile, spokesman Charles E. Redman, referring to the
medium-range Condor II that Argentina reportedly is developing with
the help of Egypt and Iraq, said ``the basic concern is that we do
what we can to limit this kind of technology because it is the kind
of technology that produces missiles that would be
nuclear-capable.''
   He said they also would exceed ``the range of parameters we
established,'' meaning a range beyond 180 miles and a payload in
excess of 1,100 pounds.
   The seven countries agreed last year that they would not export
missiles or technology for them that went beyond these limits.
   Meanwhile, an Arab League representative voiced concern about
Israel's launch Monday of a test satellite into orbit and said it
meant the Arabs would have to strengthen their defenses.
   Clovis Maksoud, who represents the Arab League in the United
States, said the satellite gave Israel ``a serious strategic
leverage'' since the country already had the capability to fire
long-range missiles.
   Maksoud, in an interview, stressed steps taken jointly by Israel
and the United States to strengthen their strategic ties.
   He cited U.S. inclusion of Israel in the program to develop a
space-based defense against ballistic missiles and ``Israel's
record, which is replete with disclaiming nuclear capability.''
   As a result, Maksoud said, the launching of a test satellite
``warrants enhancing Arab defensive capabilities'' so that any
Mideast negotiations produce a peaceful outcome ``rather than
ratifying Israeli hegemony.''
   The satellite is designed for communications purposes, but the
Arab League official said it could be used to monitor Israel's foes.
   ``We are deeply concerned that such a communications satellite
can be modified into a spy system and, therefore, further enhance
the strategic imbalance which the American-Israeli strategic
agreement has introduced,'' Maksoud said.
   State Department spokesman Redman said the United States was not
involved in any way with the Israeli program.
   ``We don't have any details of the launch beyond what was
reported by the Israelis,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Space Command in Colorado, Cmdr. Dugald
Gillies, said American radars and sensors picked up the Israeli
satellite shortly after launch. Its orbit has been calculated to
have a high point of 716 miles and a low point of 155 miles, he
said.
   ``It was launched early Monday Eastern Daylight Time and is in a
near polar orbit,'' Gillies said.
   Defense officials at the Pentagon said they were unsure exactly
what the satellite's payload included.
   ``But we're leaning toward more of an experimental
communications package as opposed to a true spy satellite,'' said
one source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``This launch is impressive because it's a first, but I don't
think this particular satellite is going to offer much more ability
to keep tabs on their neighbors,'' the source said.
   Redman stressed that Israeli leaders had given public assurances
that their goal was ``peaceful purposes of space research and
technological advancement.''
   Israel is the eighth nation to place a satellite into space. The
country is generally believed to have nuclear capability.

<HEAD>Grants Awarded For Rural Health Research Centers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than $1 million in federal grants have
been earmarked for five rural health research centers that will
provide information on a range of concerns about medical services.
   The awards were announced Monday by Otis R. Bowen, secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services, at the first meeting
of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health. The panel was
created last June to advise Congress and HHS.
   Bowen said the economic diversity of America's towns and
villages must be taken into account in considering ways of
improving rural health care services.
   ``Twenty-eight percent of the rural counties in this country
depend on manufacturing as a source of economic support; a
surprising 21 percent have become retirement settlements; 13
percent depend on farming and 8 percent rely on oil and mining,''
Bowen said.
   Jerry Coopey, a Department of Health and Human Services
spokesman, said that among the problems faced in trying to provide
adequate health services in rural areas are: too few medical
personnel, especially in obstetrics and gynecology; the closing of
small hospitals; and the rising costs of malpractice insurance.
   The research center grants were awarded to:
   _Rural Health Office of the Arizona Area Health Education
Center, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson,
$209,486;
   _Health Services Research Center, University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill, $237,000;
   _Center for Rural Health Services, Policy and Research,
University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, $195,739;
   _Research Section, Department of Family Medicine, School of
Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, $216,028;
   _Marshfield Medical Research Foundation, Marshfield, Wis.,
$202,747.
   Bowen, who practiced rural medicine as a family physician in
Indiana, also announced an award of $69,000 to the National Rural
Health Association in Kansas City, Mo., to support publication of
its Journal of Rural Health and to compile information on rural
health research projects.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Canada Trade Pact But Future Uncertain in Ottawa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan welcomed Senate approval of a
free-trade agreement with Canada as a prelude to a new surge of
economic growth in both countries, but the accord's future is
clouded by political conflict in Ottawa.
   ``It will benefit our people for generations to come,'' Reagan
said Monday following 83-9 Senate approval of the agreement with
America's top trading partner.
   ``The agreement will create jobs and stimulate economic growth
on both sides of the border and create the largest open market in
the world,'' he said.
   The Senate approved not only the agreement signed Jan. 2 by
Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney but also a bill
that would set the stage for the 10-year phaseout of tariffs called
for under the pact.
   In Canada, final approval of the agreement remains blocked by
political wrangling.
   Plans to phase out tariffs have been passed by the Canadian
House of Commons but are bottled up in the Senate, where the
controlling Liberal Party says action must await new parliamentary
elections.
   Mulroney is expected to call elections within a few weeks, and
defeat for his Conservative Party could doom the agreement.
   U.S. officials said little about the political wrangling north
of the border. Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee which
largely shaped the legislation, said Canadian political disputes
should be left to Canadians.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter told reporters
following the Senate's action that it ``puts us one step closer to
the culmination of a century-long dream on both sides of the
border.''
   On the roll call, 43 Democrats joined 40 Republicans in voting
for the measure, which never had any partisan coloring, while seven
Democrats and two Republicans opposed it.
   Israel is the only country that currently has a free-trade
agreement with the United States. But the volume is small compared
with the $131 billion in goods a year that make Canada this
country's top trading partner.
   There has been talk of free-trade agreements with Japan, No.2 in
volume of trade with the United States, and Mexico. But no such
deals are on the horizon.
   Senators with home-state industries that might suffer under the
Canadian agreement waged a largely symbolic rear guard fight
against it.
   Some lawmakers from wheat producing states objected to a
lingering Canadian subsidy for rail transportation of grain from
Saskatchewan and Alberta to the big eastern port at Thunder Bay,
Ontario. Under the agreement, however, current subsidies for
sending wheat to Vancouver would be dropped.
   Transportation costs represent a substantial portion of the
price of grain and American wheat producers have complained that
farmers north of the border will be able to undercut them because
of the continued subsidies.
   American energy companies have complained that lower-priced
Canadian products are likely to undercut them.
   And fearing that Hollywood and American publishers would
overshadow Canada's home-grown culture, Canadians also insisted on
curbs affecting U.S. cultural exports.
   Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, declared that Canada's potato
subsidies combined with curbs on U.S. potato imports amounted to
``a dramatic ... double whammy that no American industry should be
forced to endure.''
   Bentsen urged approval of the measure although he was gone from
the Senate by the time of the vote, as was GOP vice presidential
candidate Dan Quayle of Indiana. But the Texan in a morning speech
acknowledged that ``this agreement is not all that it could have
been.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said the measure ``clearly has
weaknesses.''
   ``But it is progress _ more progress than we have seen in some
time,'' Baucus told the Senate.
   Voting against the measure were Mitchell, John Melcher, D-Mont.,
William S. Cohen, R-Maine, Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Quentin Burdick,
D-N.D.; Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; Wendell Ford,
D-Ky.; and Carl Levin, D-Mich.
   Besides Bentsen and Quayle, those not voting were Sens. David
Boren, D-Okla.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; Chic Hecht, R-Nev.; Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J.; James McClure, R-Idaho; and Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio.

   Several small dolls and rattles marketed as
craft goods are being recalled by their manufacturer because they
could pose a choking hazard for children, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission has announced.
   The toys are being recalled by Fibre Craft Materials Corp. of
Niles, Ill., which said the products could be returned to the place
of purchase for a refund.
   Recalled rattles include ``Baby Rattle 4684,'' a noisemaking
blue ball atop a pink beaded handle; ``Plastic Spoon Decoration
4685,'' a pink, blue or yellow spoon with a painted-on face;
``Plastic Ball Decoration 4686,'' a blue and pink barbell; and
``Clothespin Cake Decoration 4687,'' a noisemaking blue clothespin
with a blue painted-on face.
   The dolls are being recalled because their arms may be pulled
off and possibly ingested by a child. They include ``Cupid'' dolls
numbers 3004, 3035, 3036, 3057, 3058 and 3220; ``Jill'' doll 3062,
``Beth'' doll 3086, ``Baby'' doll 3087 and ``Strawberry Girl'' doll

<HEAD>Marilyn Quayle: Husband's Strong-Willed Adviser Campaigns on Her
Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marilyn Quayle has done ``20@20.'' Her husband
Dan, the Republican running for the country's No. 2 job, has not.
He sometimes stumbles over his words. She never does.
   He can freeze when a reporter asks an unexpected question. She
is always prepared, and the only frozen look is the one she icily
bestows on an unfriendly questioner.
   Mrs. Quayle, who is on her first solo national campaign swing
this week, is considered one of the stronger assets of her
husband's campaign.
   Her skills, said a senior campaign official, have ``been
recognized'' and she has been asked to travel independently,
hooking up with the Indiana senator for joint appearances one or
two days each week.
   At 39, Mrs. Quayle is a self-possessed woman whose flip hairdo
and toothy smile evoke early Mary Tyler Moore. She is a mother of
three and a lawyer, although she hasn't practiced for some years.
   As a political wife, she's strong willed, fiercely protective
and her husband's most trusted adviser.
   On the campaign trail, she can be warm and cordial, quick with a
handshake for her husband's supporters or a hug for children at a
day care center. But she also can be cold and withdrawn, especially
around reporters.
   A practiced campaigner, Mrs. Quayle nevertheless is unaccustomed
to the Nancy Reagan-like role she has played so far _ smiling
pleasantly at her husband's side, applauding at the appropriate
points.
   ``I've never sat listening to him give speeches and all of that.
I always had my own schedule'' of campaigning, she said in a recent
interview.
   She handles most situations with aplomb. When a precocious
4-year-old at a Colorado day care center commented on Mrs. Quayle's
slightly protruding teeth as ``a little buck,'' Mrs. Quayle smiled
and said cheerfully, ``Not many people notice that.''
   She believes the press has given her husband ``the bad rap'' in
coverage of controversies over his military service, academic
record and personal life. She told Barbara Walters on ABC-TV's
``20@20'' program that the press was after her husband because he
was so conservative. She hasn't changed that view.
   ``I have my opinion, which is reinforced by some studies that
have been done on where the majority of the media is coming from.
... It's liberal,'' she said.
   She often pulls her husband away from reporters, touching his
arm or patting him on the back if he begins to respond to impromptu
questions.
   It is on such occasions, when Quayle talks extemporaneously,
that he tends to misspeak or otherwise garble his words. But Mrs.
Quayle says she is ``not trying to protect him.''
   ``He'd stand there and talk forever,'' she said. ``I'm trying to
get him back on the plane.''
   He is outgoing and affable. She seems more introspective, often
aloof. But theirs appears to be a marriage more of similarities
than differences.
   Dan Quayle and Marilyn Tucker met in 1972 when both were
attending night classes at Indiana University Law School. Ten weeks
later they were married. They opened a law office together in
Huntington, Ind., Quayle's hometown. Mrs. Quayle worked until the
birth of their second son.
   She is her husband's closest aide. At one news conference,
Quayle said his wife ``is my best adviser, my strongest supporter,
the person that I love more than anybody else in this world.''
   ``She is a very strong, independent-minded woman and she and I
have a very close relationship,'' he said.
   Mrs. Quayle says simply: ``I have a husband who has always
valued my opinion and used me as an aide. ... Our basic fundamental
values are the same. We have the same philosophy.''
   She says she thus far achieved everything she has set out to do.
For several years she has enjoyed oil painting. Eventually, she
says, she may go back to work.
   Her children _ Tucker, 14, Benjamin, 11, and Corinne, 9 _ all
have ideas about what they want to be. She says she wants them to
``pick their goals and make them high enough that once they reach
them or try to attain them, they don't feel that they've
shortchanged themselves.''
   As for her own goals, Mrs. Quayle hasn't picked out a pet
project or special area she would like to concentrate on as a vice
president's wife.
   ``I'm one of those people that have learned in politics you
don't plan anything until the election is over,'' she said.

<HEAD>Health Officials Say Care for Poor Women Is Inadequate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of former and present Cabinet-level
health officials agreed that care for America's poor women and
children is inadequate but disagreed on how to improve it.
   Arthur Fleming, who served from 1958-61 as Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, the forerunner to today's Department of
Health and Human Services, said the United States needed a
``universal system of coverage'' to ensure adequate care.
   Margaret Heckler, HHS secretary from 1983-85, agreed that health
care services for the poor needed improvement. But Heckler, the
current U.S. ambassador to Ireland, said, ``If it is based on the
system in Great Britain, we don't want that. I've seen it and many
people are now asking to go to private physicians.'' Britain has a
nationalized health care system.
   ``That's not what we're talking about,'' Fleming countered.
``Great Britain has got a government in power that has starved the
system.''
   The comments were made Monday at a meeting of the National
Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, which is composed of HEW
and HHS secretaries from the Eisenhower through the Reagan
administrations. The group was asked to help find ways to make
child health a national priority, but it issued no program for
action.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the commission created
by Congress, presented the problem in graphic terms.
   ``Millions of children are forced to go without health care
because they can't afford it or they can't find it,'' Chiles said,
noting that the U.S. infant mortality rate in 1985 ranked 19th
among all industrialized nations.
   ``This simply means that a child born in Singapore or Hong Kong
will have a better chance of reaching its first birthday than a
child that is born in the United States,'' he said. ``This means
that nearly 40,000 babies every year in our country will be in a
cemetery rather than in a nursery.''
   Current HHS Secretary Otis R. Bowen put the emphasis on what
parents and local leaders can do, not on federal government
involvement.
   ``Innocent babies are being crippled by AIDS, alcohol or drug
abuse,'' Bowen said, adding that ``50 to 60 percent of all health
costs in the United States are spent on preventable health
problems.''
   He urged prospective parents to make the necessary lifestyle
changes to ensure their children's health and asked religious
leaders to help the children make the proper lifestyle choices.
   Bowen also noted the actions business could take in providing
proper child care and health services to working mothers, as well
as contributions to medical research.
   ``This is a problem that people can do something about,'' said
David Mathews, HEW secretary from 1975-77. ``For all our efforts to
describe the problem, we give the impression that only if you are
professional, if you're an expert, can you do something about the
problem. And that's not true.''
   Other panelists were Joseph A. Califano Jr., HHS secretary
1977-79; Robert Finch, HEW secretary 1969-1970; Elliot Richardson,
HEW secretary 1970-73; and Richard Schweiker, HHS secretary 1981-83.
   Areas of agreement among panelists included:
   _The health care delivery system does not match the population's
needs.
   _Pregnant women cannot get adequate health care.
   _For too many of those who need it, insurance is not available.
   _Too little is being spent on prevention of children's health
problems.
   _There is a fragmentation of services which should be offered at
central locations.
   _The federal government should take some responsibility in
setting up above- standard day care facilities.

<HEAD>Japanese Industrialist Gives $1.5 Million to Art Gallery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Phillips Collection art gallery announced
Monday it has received a $1.5 million donation, the largest since
its founding, from Japanese industrialist Yasuhiro Goh.
   Phillips officials say they believe Goh's donation is the
largest and possibly the first significant gift from a Japanese
citizen to an American museum.
   ``I like the Phillips, because it's comfortable, a unique sort
of museum,'' said Goh, who has been visiting the gallery for about
40 years.
   Goh said he decided to make the contribution after being asked
to join the gallery's board.
   National Gallery director J. Carter Brown and Tom Freudenheim,
the Smithsonian's assistant secretary for museums, said such a
large gift from a private Japanese citizen was ``unprecedented''
and asked for Goh's address and telephone number.
   Goh's wife is a member of the Ishibashi family, which founded a
collection of French and Japanese impressionist and
postimpressionist art in Tokyo about the same time that Duncan
Phillips began his collection in the first quarter of this century.
But Goh stressed that Phillips gift comes from him, not the
Ishibashi Foundation or the family's Bridgestone tire company.
   The donation will go toward expansion of a wing of the gallery
to be opened in May 1989 which now will be named the Goh annex.

   An explosion and fire ripped through an apartment
building Monday, killing the owner and another man and injuring
four others, authorities said.
   The owner, identified later as Jeremy Conn, 56, was tinkering
with a furnace or making some repairs when the blast hit, Fire
Department spokesman Tom Sheppard said.
   The body of another victim, Marvin Handler, 41, was found
wrapped in bedclothes, indicating he was a resident and asleep when
the blast took place, said Frank Szwedo, another Fire Department
spokesman.
   Two men believed to have been working with the owner were
critically injured, and authorities were not immediately able to
get much information from them.
   The explosion may have been caused by natural gas that was
building up when water in the basement snuffed a pilot light in an
appliance, Sheppard said.
   At least three apartments were destroyed in the three-story
building, Sheppard said.
   Melvin Davis, 32, and Ronald Walker, 42, both of Evanston, were
taken to St. Francis and then transferred in critical condition to
Cook County Hospital's burn unit, said Debbie Longstreet, a St.
Francis spokeswoman. Two women were treated for cuts.
   Ed Joyce, a spokesman for Peoples Gas, said the utility shut off
gas to the building after the fire was reported, but crews found no
leaks and firefighters reported no scent of gas.

<HEAD>Some In Parliament Call For Letting Opposition Into Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The resignation of an entire Cabinet for
the first time in postwar Poland raises the possibility that more
non-communists _ even opposition figures _ will be brought into
government, parliament deputies say.
   The Sejm, or parliament, voted 359-1 with 17 abstentions Monday
to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner and
all 19 ministers in his government, which had been sharply
criticized for its handling of the economy.
   In free-wheeling debate that preceded the vote, one deputy
suggested inviting opposition members into whatever governing team
is named. Another urged reinstatement of the outlawed Solidarity
free trade union movement.
   Inflation that has reached 60 percent helped provoke a wave of
labor unrest in the spring and a second round of strikes last month
that ended when communist authorities agreed to talks with the
opposition that may include the issue of legalizing Solidarity.
   Scheduled for next month, the talks are to focus on the solving
country's daunting economic and social problems.
   The current Cabinet is to remain in place until the Sejm names a
new government, which it is expected to do later in the month.
   ``We are looking for someone who is competent, someone who has
imagination and charisma,'' said Alfred Miodowicz, a member of the
communist party's ruling Politburo and leader of the official trade
union federation OPZZ.
   In Poland, the communist party holds ultimate power, appoints
the government and mandates policy.
   Krystyna Jandy-Jendroska, chairwoman of a Sejm committee that
criticized the economic performance of Messner's government, said
in her report to parliament that more ``coalition forces'' from
outside the party should be brought into government, including
experts on the economy.
   Polish United Workers (communist) Party deputy Ryszard
Lukasiewicz, a Warsaw journalist, urged a system of ``socialist
parliamentary democracy''.
   ``Different social groups, including the opposition, must assume
participation within the authorities,'' he said. ``It would mean
significant changes in the model of the party's leadership (and)
working out a model of a ruling coalition.''
   The comments appeared in line with statements from authorities
in recent months that the government should broaden its base of
support.
   Fifteen of the resigning government's 19 ministers are
communists, two have no party affiliation, and there is one
minister each from the communist-allied Peasant Party and
Democratic Party.
   The topic of Solidarity and its chairman Lech Walesa came up
several times in the discussion that followed Messner's
announcement of the resignations.
   Solidarity ``should regain its proper place in the trade union
movement,'' said Ryszard Bender, an independent parliament member
from Lublin. It was the first call in parliament for legalizing
Solidarity since the movement was suppressed with a 1981 military
crackdown.
   Addressing Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Bender said
Jaruzelski and Walesa, ``the first Nobel Peace Prize laureate in
Polish history,'' should meet and make a joint statement concerning
Poland's ``most vital interests.''
   Jaruzelski smiled slightly but did not otherwise react.
   In all, about 30 deputies spoke, with several endorsing the
planned broad-based talks that are to include the opposition.
   At least speaker suggested the government was being used as a
whipping boy.
   ``The situation resembles a soccer game,'' said Tomasz Adamczuk,
a Peasant Party member. ``The players are the political parties,
the Polish trade union alliance, the opposition and others,'' he
said. ``The ball is the government.''

   For five homeless years on New York City's mean
streets, Chris Martin said he turned dozens of $5 tricks a day with
other men to feed his crack habit, slept in a salt-filled warehouse
and washed in a fire hydrant.
   ``I was selling my body for drugs. I was in a dead end zone,''
Martin said Monday.
   ``It was a scary life. You're on your own. Nobody's there to
guide you. You don't care where you sleep,'' he said. ``I couldn't
trust nobody. I couldn't trust myself.''
   Martin, who left home at age 15, is one of an estimated 10,000
homeless youths in New York City, according to Covenant House, an
advocacy group founded 20 years to shelter and feed teen-agers who
ran away or were abandoned by their parents.
   Children under 18 are the fastest growing segment of the
homeless population, according to an estimate released Monday by
the National Academy of Sciences.
   ``It's the era of the disposable child,'' said John Keels of
Covenant House.
   ``For them, it's a day-to-day struggle for survival, if you can
call it that,'' said Elizabeth Burnwell of Covenant House. ``They
sell their bodies to survive. They panhandle. They deaden
themselves with drugs or alcohol.''
   Each night, Covenant House, founded by the Rev. Bruce Ritter,
dispenses two vans to round up homeless children and offer them
beds, meals and clean clothes at a shelter.
   The van found Martin at a rat-infested, garbage-strewn warehouse
where the city stockpiles salt for streets in winter. Homeless
youths have built a shantytown of mattresses and crates, or they
sleep in junked garbage trucks.
   ``They're brave kids,'' Ritter said. ``They're desperate to get
back off the streets. Most of them won't make it.''
   One who made it into the shelter was Kenny Uledi of Brooklyn,
who lived for six months on the streets with his 16-year-old
brother after they were abandoned. His parents were drug addicts
who were evicted from their home and left without a word or trace,
Uledi said.
   ``We robbed car radioes. We robbed cold cuts from supermarkets.
We slept on roofs. Anything to get by,'' said the 5-foot-8,
130-pound Uledi, the pain evident in his blue eyes.
   ``You wonder where your next meal is coming from. It's hard out
there in the streets. I want to forget it all,'' he said.
   Street kids are not included in the city's count of the
homeless. As of Sept. 1, the city had 5,135 homeless families in
system, including 10,799 children, according to the city's Human
Resources Administration. They stay in a system of 39 hotels and 35
shelters.
   In some hotels, prostitutes turn tricks on stairwells. Crack is
sold openly. Beatings occur every day. And a family of four may be
crowded in a 9-by-12-foot room.
   ``There's nothing a kid doesn't see in here,'' said Jackie
Macklin, 31, who lived for four years in one of the city's welfare
hotels.
   She sent her 11-year-old twin daughters to live in Philadelphia
with their grandmother in 1987 after they saw a security guard shot
dead in the Holland Hotel.
   ``These children live under the most extreme conditions of
adversity of any child population in the developed world. They're
the closest thing we have to refugees in the Third World,'' said
Dr. Irwin Redlener of New York Hospital.
   ``It's total depravation. They have been disconnected from a
useful support system a civilized society tries to provide. We're
going to pay a price for this,'' Redlener said.
   Redlener treats 200 homeless children a week from two medical
vans that are pediatric clinics on wheels. Half the patients lack
immunization and many suffer from ear infections and asthma,
Redlener said.
   ``It's a way of dying on the installment plan,'' said Gretchen
Buchenholz of the Association to Benefit Children, an advocacy
group that runs a shelter for children.
   ``Their life is so harsh. They lose their childhood, the magic
that belongs to being a child. It's very sad to see a child lose
that resilience. We're doing irreparable harm,'' she said.
   ``We're killing a generation of very poor kids,'' said Robert
Hayes, founder of New York's Coalition for the Homeless. ``It's an
abandonment of the most fragile people to the most devastating of
environments.''

<HEAD>Other Instructors Back Up Rescue-Swimmer Teacher's Story</HEAD>

   Two rescue-swimmer instructors testified
under immunity Monday, backing up the story of a sailor standing
court-martial in the drowning of a Navy recruit during a training
exercise.
   The defense rested later Monday, and the trial was recessed
until Thursday when closing arguments will be made by lawyers on
both sides.
   The military judge, Cmdr. Newell D. Krogmann, planned to meet
Tuesday with lawyers to work on instructions for the panel of five
officers hearing the case. One panel member asked for an additional
day's delay because Wednesday is Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday, said
Lt. Cmdr. Dennis Hessler, a Navy spokesman.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, 28, of Tempe, Ariz., has
denied he helped push Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki back into a
swimming pool March 2 after Mirecki panicked and climbed out.
   He also testified that Mirecki, 19, from Appleton, Wis.,
completed a lifesaving maneuver, in which he freed himself from a
head hold applied by Combe, just seconds before collapsing in the
pool at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   The Navy has accused Combe of forcing Mirecki's head under water
and charged him with involuntary manslaughter, battery and
conspiracy to commit battery.
   Combe was in the pool at the time other instructors pried
Mirecki away from an equipment rack and ``dropped him back in the
water,'' testified Petty Officer 2nd Class Frankie D. Deaton.
   Deaton said he and now-retired Petty Officer 2nd Class David
Smith, who testified Friday, were joined by two other instructors,
whose identity he was unable to remember, in pushing Mirecki into
the pool.
   Deaton said he didn't see what happened after Mirecki was tossed
back in the pool because he went into the lockerroom.
   But Petty Officer 2nd Class John Zelenock was close by and
supported Combe's contention that Mirecki completed the escape and
put Combe in a cross-chest carry.
   ``I really felt good about it overall because I figured his
(Mirecki's) confidence level was boosted 100 percent,'' Zelenock
said.
   Between the time Mirecki was returned to the pool and his
drowning, the recruit had grabbed a rope dividing the pool. Combe
admitted last week he dunked Mirecki for three seconds to get him
to drop his grip.
   Zelenock testified that while at the rope with Combe, Smith and
Mirecki, the recruit said, ``I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't.
I can't.''
   ``I asked, did he want want to be here? And he definitely said
`yes' to me.''
   At that point, Zelenock said he told Mirecki to get on with the
procedure or get out of the pool, and the recruit stayed in.

   Whoopi Goldberg plans to boldly go where no
comedian-actress has gone before with a new role as an ``alien
humanoid hostess'' in the ``Star Trek: The Next Generation''
television series.
   Miss Goldberg's character, Guinan, will be seen in occasional
episodes of Paramount Television's syndicated show, which is
entering its second season, according to a news release.
   The ``Ten-Forward'' lounge where Miss Goldberg's character will
preside is new to the series and will give its writers a chance to
show characters relaxing.
   ``I've always been a Trekkie, so I thought it was time for me to
boldly go where no man has gone before,'' said Miss Goldberg, 32,
referring to the original ``Star Trek'' show's opening line
describing the mission of the Starship Enterprise.
   Goldberg has starred in several movies and won a Golden Globe
and an Academy Award nomination in 1985 for her role in ``The Color
Purple.'' Her latest movie, ``Clara's Heart,'' will be released
next month.

   Oscar-winning actor John Houseman may be
about to turn 86, but he says he has no intention of retiring.
   ``I have tapered off a little, but I wouldn't know what to do
with myself if I retired,'' said Houseman, whose birthday is
Thursday. ``I still have something to offer, even though the roles
these days are usually small.
   ``But I'm 85 years old. I am not going to be offered the role of
Romeo any more, Or Juliet, for that matter. Yet the limited range I
do play, I play well. My range is that of an old man, but what do
you expect from someone who started acting at the age of 70?''
   Houseman has three movies awaiting release, a
soon-to-be-published autobiography, appearances in television
commercials and exposure from the syndicated TV show ``Paper
Chase.''

   Actress Ann Jillian, whose battle
with breast cancer was made into a television movie, said she owes
her recovery to God and her husband, Andy.
   ``Andy was really terrific with me,'' said Miss Jillian, 37, who
underwent a double mastectomy three years ago.
   Miss Jillian urged women to perform breast self-examinations,
saying she discovered her cancer through such an examination.
   ``If it's a question of a breast and a question of life then
there's no question at all,'' Miss Jillian said last week in a
speech at East Tennessee State University.
   ``Whatever your faith is, if you're not familiar with it, find
it,'' she said. ``I have no courage or strength but whatever God
gives me.''
   Her battle with cancer was chronicled in the television movie,
``The Ann Jillian Story.''

   Actor Nicholas Cage says he believes he's
emerging from the shadow of his famous uncle, Francis Ford Coppola,
after 10 movie roles of his own.
   ``I've always had this feeling that people didn't want to take
me seriously because of my uncle,'' Cage said in an interview being
published in next month's Cosmopolitan magazine.
   ``I've always said to myself, `If anyone's going to accept me,
I'm going to have to be twice as good.' I think people now know I
work hard and try to give them their money's worth,'' said Cage,
whose leading ladies have included Cher in ``Moonstruck,'' Kathleen
Turner in ``Peggy Sue Got Married'' and Holly Hunter in ``Raising
Arizona.''
   ``Holly is the only actress I've worked with who has been full
of surprises in her acting,'' said Cage. ``It was like she had a
Felix the Cat bag of tricks and just kept pulling things out.''

   Cardinal John O'Connor visited the American
Stock Exchange to thank traders for a hefty donation, telling them
he'd like to return the favor by raising the market, but declined,

   The archbishop of New York stopped by the exchange Monday to
thank the traders for a $71,000 contribution to the Cardinal's
Committee of the Laity, which supports shelters for the homeless,
soup kitchens, parochial schools and other Roman Catholic charities.
   ``You've had your reverses down here on Wall Street, but you've
maintained your courage and your faith,'' he told exchange workers
on the trading floor.
   ``I wish I could lift the market up for you, but that's not my
field,'' he added.
   The cardinal strolled around the trading floor several times,
inspiring bursts of applause. He shook hands with traers beneath
the dozens of green computer screens and electronic stock-price
tapes that line the room.

   To paraphrase an old saying: Better wed than
dead _ particularly in that mausoleum.
   That's where a Flint couple began their married life, because
the bride said such a structure represents the loving qualities of
her new marriage.
   ``It's a sanctuary, a place of love and a place of memories,''
said Gwen Lynk, the bride and a sales counselor at Flint Memorial
Park. ``And we (employees and owners of the cemetery) all treat
each other like family here, and it was nice to be among family.''
   Lynk and Steven S. Schultz were married Sunday in the building,
which has skylights and stained glass windows, amid balloons,
streamers, floral arrangements and tombs.
   Some of the preceremony guests were people who came to visit
crypts, unaware of the wedding.
   ``They were favorably impressed that we were going to be married
in that setting,'' Lynk said.

   Specialty shops that cater to
pampered pets are proliferating in California faster than rabbits,
industry watchers say.
   Such stores are occupying more retail space, but far fewer
operate outside California, said John M. McMillin, a food industry
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   ``Only Californians would put their dogs on a diet,'' he said.
``But I'm seeing more and more interest in people getting into this
business.''
   The stores provide such items as gourmet foods, handmade toys
and European furniture.
   ``People are definitely pampering their pets more. I find many
of the people are more concerned with their animals' nutrition than
their own,'' said Jan Edminster, owner of the Pet Shop. People are
``starting to realize that grocery store (pet) food is junk food,
and they don't want their pets to have it.''
   At Companion Pet Supply, owner Joseph Hale offers customers such
items as $60 fur-lined dog beds and $40 fake diamond-studded
leashes and collars.
   The store helps pet owners ``spoil their babies,'' said Hale,
owner of more than 200 birds. He said he's unmarried and never
wants human children.

   The 4-foot-long lizard snapped his
teeth and wagged his tongue at residents of this town, creating
what looked like an outtake from a ``B'' horror film.
   ``Apparently, this thing was not very happy and was trying to
bite everything in sight,'' Tompkins County sheriff's Deputy David
Bush said after the 5-pound, non-poisonous reptile was captured
Sunday.
   Several Brooktondale residents spotted the lizard Saturday and
tried to catch it, but the animal quickly shredded the paper bag it
was stuffed into, said Gordon Gabaree, of the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation. The lizard escaped and
apparently spent Saturday night in the woods.
   ``This is the kind of lizard they use in Hollywood movies with
the long waving tail, the claws to dig into the skin and the
fork-shaped tongue,'' said Kraig Adler, a Cornell University
biology professor.
   The lizard's now in Adler's custody while he looks for the
owner. If no one claims the lizard, Adler said, it will probably be
donated to the Burnet Park Zoo in Syracuse.

<HEAD>Dress Code Aims at Ending Thefts, Rivalry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school made famous by Eddie Murphy has
banned gold chains, designer sunglasses or other expensive status
symbols to prevent an expensive competition students can't afford,
the principal says.
   ``I see and hear about the youngsters being shot over gold
chains as they walk to and from school,'' Mumford High School
Principal Robin E. Oden said. ``My kids (students) have been
harassed. Recognizing that, I want to make sure that it doesn't
spill over into the school.''
   The dress code established this school year also bans tank tops,
jogging suits, snakeskin-adorned gym shoes and like finery at the
2,500-student, inner-city school, which gained fame through
T-shirts Murphy wore in the film ``Beverly Hills Cop.''
   A student who violates the code gets a written notice, which is
sent to his or her parents. Repeat offenses can result in a
three-to five-day suspension.
   Oden said a 14-year-old student told him last year that she had
heard a dress code was being considered and that she hoped one
would be adopted.
   ``She said she couldn't afford to purchase expensive things and
felt bad when she couldn't compete with her peers,'' the principal
said. ``That troubled me, so I talked to other students and found
out they felt the same way.''
   Rivalry involving expensive clothing has sometimes turned
violent. Two 17-year-old boys were wounded by gunfire last year
after one was robbed of a blue sheepskin jacket.
   Three years ago, a Detroit retailer threatened to discontinue a
brand of gym shoes when a 13-year-old was shot in the chest after
giving his gym shoes to five youths who demanded them.
   On a recent afternoon, some students were spotted near Mumford
High wearing gold or other expensive jewelry and other banned
items. They said they stashed it at school during the day, then
wore it home.
   Oden said a student who did the same thing was assaulted by two
boys who robbed her of two gold chains. He said he told other
students of the incident at an assembly.
   Oden said he is encouraged by the students following the code.
   ``I invite you to stand out in the hall and I dare you to find
any gold jewelry,'' he said. ``We've had to deal with some
students, but we have not had any suspensions to this day. About 98
percent of my students adhere to the dress code to the letter.''

<HEAD>Board Approves Policy To Let Patients Veto Care By AIDS Carriers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite criticism from the American Medical
Association, the county board voted Monday to give patients at Cook
County Hospital the right to refuse treatment from health care
workers who are carriers of the AIDS virus.
   The hospital would become the first in the country to adopt such
a policy. Hospital officials said they have not yet developed a way
to implement it, however.
   The county board, which also serves as the hospital's board of
directors, voted 15-2 to adopt the policy. Approval was expected,
after the policy was adopted by the board's Health and Hospital
Committee last week.
   The policy covers all hospital workers who ``routinely provide
direct patient care'' including doctors and nurses. But medical and
hospital associations have called it misguided.
   ``Our reaction is one of dismay,'' said Dr. Lonnie Bistow,
speaking for the AMA, after the committee vote last week. ``There
has been no case in this country of a patient contracting the AIDS
virus from a health-care worker.''
   Acquired immune defficiency syndrome destroys the body's
defenses against diseases, leaving a person prey to
life-threatening infections and certain cancers.
   AIDS has struck more than 72,000 people in this country since
1979 and killed more than 40,000 of them, according to the natioal
Centers for Disease Control.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle, stumping across Republican
strongholds in the West, is skewering Michael Dukakis as a
Massachusetts liberal out of sync with voters on a host of issues
from gun control to taxes to defense.
   Quayle today was visiting an irrigation project at a nearby
diversion dam, then holding a rally on the steps of the state
capital before flying on to Las Vegas.
   He faced spirited hecklers Monday at a Knoxville stop before
journeying to Casper, Wyo., and here, but didn't let them interrupt
his volley of criticism at Dukakis' defense posture and his record
as governor of Massachusetts.
   ``Chicken hawk'' signs and catcalls like those he heard in
Knoxville serve as reminders of the controversy over his getting in
the National Guard at the height of the Vietnam war.
   But the Indiana senator now has campaigned in 30 states since
George Bush tapped him as his running mate five weeks ago; Nevada
will be the 31st. He will add a 32nd, Arizona, when he flies there
Wednesday before a return visit to California.
   His mission, as he told 250 supporters at a rally in Casper on
Monday evening, is to ``take a hard look at (Dukakis') record for
competence and burst his bubble for the voters of America.''
   ``The West has a lot of big, open spaces _ just like the Dukakis
defense record,'' Quayle told the Casper crowd.
   He laughed as he recalled the sight of a helmet-clad Dukakis
riding in a tank last week.
   ``In just one week, his defense policy went from general
confusion to General Patton,'' the Indiana senator said.
   He claimed that Dukakis wants to disarm everyone except the
police and military, and said that while Dukakis ``brags about
being a card-carrying member of the ACLU'' (American Civil
Liberties Union), Bush belongs to the National Rifle Association.
   He also criticized Dukakis for opposing the death penalty under
any circumstances, and said that he let killers out of jail on
``weekend junkets'' in Massachusetts.
   In Knoxville and Casper, he charged that Dukakis was driving
citizens away from Massachusetts with high taxes and spending _
higher spending per capita than any other state. ``That's not what
you want to rank first in,'' he said.
   He charged that Dukakis ``did not create an economic miracle in
Massachusetts. He created an economic manacle.''
   Quayle said Massachusetts ranks 40th out of 50 states in total
employment growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth. It actually
lost 90,000 manufacturing jobs between June 1984 and January 1988,
he said.
   Former Tennessee Sen. and White House chief of staff Howard
Baker, who accompanied Quayle to Knoxville, said after the
boisterous rally, ``He handled it well. That's the real test of a
politician. The hecklers were few, but they were noisy. He didn't
get angry. ... He made his speech and cast one missile at them and
it took. The crowd was with him.''
   Quayle conceded that Massachusetts has a low unemployment rate,
but said that is because ``people are leaving Massachusetts.''
   Quayle said Dukakis ``raised virtually every tax in
Massachusetts'' and opposed a statewide proposition that limited
tax increases. When taxes were cut, Quayle said, the credit
belonged to the legislature, not the governor.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito, at 87 the world's longest
reigning monarch, received a blood transfusion after vomiting blood
and was in stable condition at the Imperial Palace on Tuesday,
palace officials and news reports said.
   But the respected Kyodo news agency, citing unidentified
``government sources,'' said at midday that the emperor appeared to
be in critical condition. Officials would not confirm the report.
   The government decided Tuesday to place Crown Prince Akihito,
54, the emperor's eldest son, in charge of all matters of state
until the emperor recovers, Defense Agency head Kichiro Tazawa said.
   Tazawa told reporters after a regular Cabinet meeting that the
Cabinet was expected to formally approve the appointment Thursday.
   Kyodo said the government was considering whether to advise
Cabinet members to remain at their offices and not leave Tokyo.
   The emperor's death would plunge Japan into official mourning,
for which there would be no modern precedent. Hirohito has been on
the throne since 1926, and older Japanese who grew up when he was
considered divine revere him greatly. Those born after World War II
tend to have less interest in the emperor, who renounced his
divinity after the war.
   Court physicians were summoned to the palace in central Tokyo
after the emperor vomited blood shortly before 10 p.m. (9 a.m. EDT)
Monday and they gave him a blood transfusion for four hours
beginning at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, the imperial official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The doctors ruled out hospitalizing the aged emperor.
   Television and news service reports said Hirohito received 1.7
pints of blood during the transfusion and was fully conscious
during the treatment.
   Following the transfusion, the emperor's temperature fell to
about 98.6 degrees and his pulse was a normal 90 beats per minute,
according to the imperial official.
   After two consecutive days of fever, Hirohito's condition grew
worse late Monday. Imperial officials said court phsycians found
traces of jaundice in his blood and would perform minor surgery if
the fever continued.
   Hirohito suffered a 100.4 degree fever Sunday.
   Almost one year ago on Sept. 22, the emperor underwent an
intestinal operation, and doctors found a hard, egg-size
enlargement of the pancreas, which blocked the duodenum. Surgeons
did not remove the blockage but performed a bypass around it.
   In recent weeks the emperor has suffered a cold, according to
the imperial agency, and news reports last week said he has lost 20
pounds from his weight of 130 pounds before his surgery last year.
   Akihito, heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne that Hirohito has held
since Christmas Day 1926, and Crown Princess Michiko came to the
palace Tuesday morning. Nationally broadcast television reports
showed limousines bearing members of the imperial family arriving
at the palace to pay their respects.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita visited early Tuesday to sign
his name on a list of well-wishers, according to television reports.

   A 30-year-old Wisconsin man was
sentenced to five days in jail today for selling Olympic tickets at
a $33 profit, police said.
   James K. Rush of Madison was the first person to be jailed for
scalping Olympic tickets, police said. He was caught Monday selling
five tickets for a diving event for a profit totaling 24,000 won
($33.33), they said.
   Police said Rush told them he bought 44 tickets for Monday's
diving competition at a travel agency in Los Angeles early this
month, but had been unable to sell 34 of the tickets.
   In South Korea, it is illegal to resell tickets at prices higher
than face value at places of public entertainment, stadiums or
transit centers. The maximum penalty for such offenses is 30 days
in jail.
   Meanwhile, Yonhap News Agency reported that two American
teen-agers were booked for investigation on charges of theft after
they were caught snatching a large flag with the five-ring Olympic
emblem from a roadside pole today.
   The report said the two unidentified youths told police they
wanted to give the flag as a gift to their friends.

<TEXT>
   ``A Fish Called Wanda'' lured enough moviegoers
last weekend to bag first place in the nation's box office
rankings, which was weakened by the Olympics and bad weather.
   ``Wanda,'' a comedy starring John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis,
earned $2.55 million, according to figures provided by Exhibitor
Relations Co. It was the comedy's first time in the top slot after
10 weeks of release.
   But the overall box-office take was down for the weekend. By
comparison, ``Moon Over Parador,'' took in $3.2 million for first
place the previous weekend.
   ``Between the Olympics and the ball games, both college and
professional, and the normal letdown for this time of year, box
office suffered,'' said Exhibitor Relations chief John Krier.
``Hurricane Gilbert and cold weather in some areas were also
factors.''
   In second place was ``Die Hard'' with $2.54 million, followed by
``Moon Over Parador,'' which sold $2.45 million in tickets.
``Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,'' earned $2.2
million for fourth place.
   Disney's ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' earned $2.08 million,
edging ``Betrayed,'' with $2.07 million, for fifth and sixth place,
respectively.
   In another close-ranking, ``Young Guns'' drew $1.9 million for
seventh place, and ``Cocktail'' stirred up $1.8 million in ticket
sales for eighth spot.
   Ninth was ``Married To The Mob'' with $1.39 million, and the
Eddie Murphy comedy ``Coming To America'' re-entered the top 10
with $1.30 million for 10th place.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' MGM, $2.55 million, 1,207 screens,
$2,117 per screen, $45.1 million, 10 weeks.
   2. ``Die Hard,'' 20th Century Fox, $2.54 million, 1,371 screens,
$1,853 per screen, $65.3 million, 10 weeks.
   3. ``Moon Over Parador,'' Universal, $2.45 million, 1,143
screens, $2,145 per screen, $6.6 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,'' New Line,
$2.2 million, 1,465 screens, $1,516 per screen, $41.3 million, five
weeks.
   5. ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' Disney, $2.08 million, 1,393
screens, $1,498 per screen, $135.9 million, 13 weeks.
   6. ``Betrayed,'' MGM, $2.07 million, 1,101 screens, $1,882 per
screen, $19.6 million, four weeks.
   7. ``Young Guns,'' 20th Century Fox, $1.9 million, 1,358
screens, $1,443 per screen, $34.7 million, six weeks.
   8. ``Cocktail,'' Disney, $1.8 million, 1,364 screens, $1,379 per
screen, $63 million, eight weeks.
   9. ``Married To The Mob,'' Orion, $1.39 million, 827 screens,

<TEXT>
   For all the grand designs of the presidential
nominees, a large number of Americans believe neither candidate
could deliver on most of his campaign promises, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   About half the 1,125 adults in the national survey saw both men
as strong leaders, with Michael Dukakis rated by more as
compassionate and George Bush rated by more as competent to manage
the federal government.
   But just 36 percent said Bush could accomplish most of his
stated goals in office, and only 31 percent said Dukakis could do
most of what he wants. Nearly half said either would be stymied in
office; the rest were unsure.
   Seven in 10 respondents agreed nonetheless that the outcome of
the election will have a major impact on the nation's future. But
they were divided evenly, 45-45, on whether the election will
affect them personally.
   Results of the poll, conducted the week after Labor Day,
underscored Bush's success since the Republican Convention at
controlling the campaign agenda. Fifty-two percent said he had
clear positions on the issues, while just 37 percent said the same
of Dukakis. The results were released Monday.
   Bush also was perceived as the better government manager, 50-34,
despite Dukakis' claim to the issue. And 77 percent said Bush
understands the complex problems a president faces, while only 44
percent said that of Dukakis.
   Bush won overwhelming endorsement as better able to maintain a
strong defense, chosen over Dukakis by 67 percent 15 percent. Bush
was narrowly seen as more likely to cut the federal deficit, 38-30.
   In a measure that bodes well for an incumbent party, six in 10
said they were better off now than they were four years ago or
eight years ago, and 55 percent expected their family finances to
improve in the next few years.
   Bush had mixed success in his effort to paint Dukakis as more
likely to raise taxes: A plurality, 45 percent, said there wasn't
likely to be any difference between the two when it comes to that
issue.
   Dukakis was rated higher than Bush on some personal issues.
Sixty-two percent said Dukakis cares about people like them, while
50 percent said that of Bush. Forty-two percent said Bush sometimes
talks carelessly, without considering the consequences; just 30
percent said that of Dukakis.
   The two were about equal in some other ratings: Six in 10 said
both offer a vision of where they want to lead the country and five
in 10 said both were strong leaders. Six in 10 said Bush would have
good judgment under pressure and five in 10 said that of Dukakis.
   Bush was rated as better for the rich and Dukakis as better for
the poor, but respondents were split on which would do more for the
middle class. They were nearly split on which candidate would do
more to improve education, with 39 percent choosing Dukakis and 33
percent Bush.
   Bush led solidly among respondents who said they plan to vote
and had definitely made a choice, partly because a greater share of
Republicans said they had decided. The gauge is a different one
than in other national polls.
   Fifty-seven percent said they planned to vote and had made a
definite choice; they favored Bush by 56-39. Dukakis led, 48-42, in
a late June-early July poll, indicating that even opinions
expressed as firm are movable.
   The poll found a three-way split in ideology, with about a third
each calling themselves Republicans, Democrats and independents.
Other recent polls had similar results, a departure from the
longtime Democratic lead in this measure.
   The Media General-AP poll was conducted the week after Labor
Day, Sept. 6-14, among a random sample of adults nationwide. It had
a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points for all
respondents, four points for those who said they planned to vote
and had chosen a candidate.

<TEXT>
   Aides to Michael Dukakis, incensed by what one
called George Bush's misleading ``statistical hit-and-run,'' are
organizing Democratic surrogates to respond more aggressively to
the vice president's attacks, which in recent days have focused on
the Massachusetts economy.
   That strategy was evident Monday when, within hours of a Bush
speech, the Dukakis campaign called on eight business leaders to
meet with reporters to rebut Bush's characterization of the
Democratic nominee as an anti-business governor.
   Dukakis advisers, frustrated by what they contend has been far
too little scrutiny of Bush's attacks, promised similar events in
the future.
   The latest salvos have particularly angered the Dukakis camp
because they center on the Massachusetts economy _ the backbone of
the Dukakis candidacy.
   ``Our view is that a candidate has an obligation to tell the
truth to the American people,'' said Kirk O'Donnell, a senior
Dukakis adviser. ``But George Bush has played fast and loose with
the facts last week and he's doing it again this week. It's what we
call statistical hit-and-run.''
   Last week Bush charged that Massachusetts taxpayers had suffered
under Dukakis and that the state was $7.4 billion in debt, a figure
the Bush campaign cited to assert that Dukakis since 1983 had
amassed more debt than all the governors ``from the Pilgrims to Ed
King,'' his predecessor.
   The figures he cited to support the increased tax burden indeed
showed that per-capita taxes increased in Massachusetts from 1983
to 1987 but failed to factor in record growth of personal income in
the state during that period. Taxes were cut in those years _
mostly over Dukakis' objections _ but the average Massachusetts
resident pays more taxes because he or she is earning more money.
   And while Dukakis is authorized to issue bonds totaling $7.4
billion, the state's current bonded indebtedness is $3.9 million _
lower in inflation-adjusted dollars than the debt Dukakis inherited
from King.
   ``The bottom line is that in taxes, across the board,
Massachusetts citizens pay more than they did several years ago,''
said Bush spokesman Mark Goodin. ``We're not going to back down one
iota.''
   Bush continued his assault Monday, telling a Chamber of Commerce
luncheon in Pennsylvania that Dukakis had an ``anti-business
scheme'' and that the number of business bankruptcies in
Massachusetts was up 23.7 percent during the first six months of
the year while the national rate had fallen 23.5 percent. Goodin
said the figures came from the Small Business Administration.
   Dukakis aides said they had not seen those figures but again
accused Bush of misrepresentation _ citing figures showing business
failures in Massachusetts had declined by 28 percent since Dukakis
became governor in 1983, and that they had occurred at less than
half the national rate during the Reagan presidency.
   ``We're running against a guy who kicked off his campaign in
Disneyland,'' said Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan, referring to a
Labor Day appearance there by Bush. ``He has Goofy as his economist
or something and is throwing out daffy statistics. This is the kind
of opponent we have and expected and we are prepared to run
against.''
   Gearan, citing New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley's appearance on a
weekend news program to support Dukakis' views on defense and
foreign policy, said leading members of the Democratic Party would
be called on to rebut some Bush charges while Massachusetts
business and industry leaders would address Bush comments about the
state economy.
   ``My company has grown and prospered under the leadership of
Governor Dukakis,'' Wang Computer Co. founder An Wang, a Dukakis
supporter, told the Monday briefing. ``He created the atmosphere
that made it possible for us to grow.''
   Dukakis will respond as well when he sees fit, said Gearan, who
with other Dukakis aides encouraged increased media scrutiny of
Bush's statements.
   ``Bush has a record of being wrong,'' O'Donnell said. ``Not only
are we on notice but the press is on notice. He has consistently
misrepresented the facts and not been accurate.''
   Goodin rejected that characterization as ``nonsense.''
   ``I think the big lie is that they are making Massachusetts out
to be some sort of economic miracle,'' Goodin said.

   The Navy's new Trident 2 submarine
missile has suffered a second failure in its last three test
firings, its wreckage tumbling into the Atlantic Ocean after it
went astray and was deliberately blown up.
   The $23.7 million missile blasted off a land launch pad Monday
and appeared to be accelerating smoothly across a clear sky when it
suddenly exploded several miles above the ocean.
   The Navy reported that the Trident 2 had developed a problem in
the second stage about 60 seconds after liftoff, and when it veered
off course, the range safety officer sent a radio signal to ignite
explosive packages in the vehicle.
   The failure was the third in 15 test firings for the missile
being groomed as the most powerful in the Navy's nuclear arsenal.
But two of the last three have been destroyed by the range safety
officer.
   The 44-foot, three-stage missile has nearly 6,000-mile range,
but the Navy declined to disclose how far the unarmed warhead
package was to have traveled Monday.
   Five more land pad launches are scheduled here, to be followed
by at least five test launches from submerged submarines. It was
not known if the latest failure would have an impact on the test
schedule.
   The weapons is scheduled to be deployed late next year.
   Each Trident 2 is designed to hurl up to 10 nuclear warheads to
different targets. There will be 24 of the missiles in each Trident
submarine.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations opens its 43rd General
Assembly with enhanced prestige due to the Iran-Iraq truce and
Afghan accords, a reputation that may tarnish once debate begins.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar wryly observed that
the world body, convening today, has high expectations to live up
to.
   ``If the United Nations is treated as an angel, then we must
remember that the halo that slips 10 inches is a noose,'' he said
at a luncheon of the U.N. Correspondents Association on Monday.
   The session opens with the election of the president of the
General Assembly after a behind-the-scenes fight that has revived
some lingering enmity from the 1982 Falkland Islands War between
Britain and Argentina.
   Foreign Minister Dante Caputo of Argentina has campaigned hard
against Barbados' U.N. ambassador, Dame Ruth Nita Barrow, who
Britain has backed.
   Diplomatic sources said the race was too close to call, and
there could be several secret ballots before one candidate wins a
simple majority of the assembly's 159 voting member states. The
outgoing president is Peter Florin, from East Germany's Foreign
Ministry.
   The United Nations has won progress and praise with its
Iran-Iraq truce, Afghan accord, and other looming peace initiatives
in southern Africa, Cambodia and the Western Sahara. But the
general debate that begins Monday may generate more heat than light.
   One fight is expected over a proposed address by South Korea on
the 40th anniversary of its founding. Both it and communist North
Korea have non-voting observer status and cannot speak before the
assembly without an invitation.
   The United States, Japan and other nations back South Korea's
speech. But the Soviet bloc has opposed the move and sponsored a
resolution Monday inviting North Korea to deliver an address.
   China has not sponsored either resolution but opposes a South
Korean speech.
   On Monday, President Reagan is to deliver his final speech to
the world body, which his administration has criticized over the
years for bureaucracy, waste and an anti-Western bias.
   The Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and
President Francois Mitterrand of France also are to address the
assembly. The session will hear 13 heads of state, six prime
ministers and numerous foreign ministers.
   The assembly will again take up intransigent issues such as
peace in the Middle East and the Palestinian uprising in Israel's
occupied lands.
   In his annual report released Monday, Perez de Cuellar painted a
cautiously optimistic picture of the organization, citing:
   _the U.N.-mediated Afghanstan accords signed April 14 under
which about 100,000 Soviet troops are leaving that nation;
   _a U.N.-supervised cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war that began
Aug. 20;
   _the Iran-Iraq peace talks that opened Aug. 25;
   _a U.N.-sponsored meeting between Greek and Turkish Cypriot
leaders of divided Cyprus;
   _initiatives for peace in Western Sahara, South-West Africa and
neighboring Angola and positive signs for a political settlement to
the guerrilla war in Cambodia.
   Perez de Cuellar noted continuing problems in the Middle East,
Central America, South Africa's enforcement of apartheid and the
division of the Korean Peninsula.
   The secretary-general said the United Nations still faces a
financial crisis, despite a U.S. promise to pay $144 million in
arrears and hundreds of millions of dollars in other back dues for
previous years and for peacekeeping funds.
   The Peruvian diplomat said the organization faces a cash
shortage ``which threatens insolvency in the next few months, and
the virtual depletion of reserves.''
   He said he would ask the General Assembly urgently to consider
new ways of raising money, such as voluntary contributions,
interest-free loans and changes in the scale of assessments.

   Strong winds late Monday fanned an arson fire over a containment
line and into the Northern California town of Vacaville, forcing
500 people to flee, but cool, damp weather helped firefighters
battle blazes in the Northwest.
   The sheriff's department ordered the evacuation from home in
rural Vacaville, but most complied voluntarily, said California
Department of Forestry spokesman John Ferreira.
   The fire, which has destroyed nine homes and charred more than
17,000 acres of brush, is the larger of two major Northern
California blazes. The other destroyed six homes as it roared
across about 8,000 acres of wildland, brush and timber near Redding.
   At the fire in Redding near Shasta County, two men clearing
burned timber were seriously injured Monday when a tree fell on
them, forestry officials said. Both men, suffering head and back
injuries, were hospitalized in critical condition, officials said.
   Fifteen fires still burning Monday had charred 1.39 million
acres in Wyoming, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Idaho and
California, said Arnold Hartigan of the Interagency Fire Center in
Boise, Idaho. In all this season, 69,099 fires have blackened
4,140,000 acres, including about 2 million acres in Alaska, he said.
   The dwindling number of civilian and military firefighters in
Yellowstone National Park worked Monday to deepen fire lines around
fires that have burned 1.1 million acres of the 2.2 million-acre
park.
   Officials said they can now reduce the number of firefighters in
the park, which once totaled more than 8,000. About 550 soldiers
returned to Fort Lewis, Wash., on Sunday after four weeks, and two
battalions were preparing to leave.
   In addition, officials had started releasing employees of the
National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land
Management, said fire information officer Marv Crocker.
   ``There are no real hot fires out there,'' he said. ``If there
were, we'd keep the agency people for their experience. There's
nothing very exciting out there today.''
   The Miller fire that destroyed nine homes near Vacaville, 55
miles northeast of San Francisco, was 50 percent contained Monday.
But estimates that the fire would be controlled by Wednesday
morning had to be abandoned when the fire jumped a road Monday and
forced the closure of another, said Alleah Haley, a state forestry
spokeswoman.
   Control of the 8,000-acre Fern fire that destroyed six homes
near Redding in Northern California was predicted for Tuesday
evening, said CDF spokeswoman Sharon Wages.
   Officials said about 5,500 firefighters remained in and around
Yellowstone on Monday, including about 4,000 Army soldiers and
Marines, Crocker said.
   ``Until the fires are out, there is still some potential
threat,'' said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. ``Primarily, the
crews are doing mop-up on existing fire lines, working back into
the fire and creating a bigger break.''
   Fire experts were optimistic that recent frosty days in the park
may have spelled the end of burning conditions such as those that
allowed blazes to race across miles in hours.
   ``I would be surprised if the fires made any more major runs,''
said fire behavior analyst Bruce Freet. ``I think we're into a
cooling, moist trend. I won't say wet, but this might be enough to
hold it where it's at right now.''
   Crews also were being reduced at fires remaining in Oregon,
Washington and Montana, and outdoor fire restrictions were lifted
in Montana and in part of Idaho. Officials in Montana said about
940 firefighters remained at the 35,400-acre Red Bench fire in
Glacier Park and in west-central Montana just three 20-member crews
monitor the smoldering 247,000-acre Canyon Creek fire.
   ``It's all due to the fact that we've gotten a lot of rain up
here, and looking at the forecast we're going to get more,'' said
Allen Gibbs, spokesman for the Panhandle National Forest in Idaho.

<TEXT>
   Average SAT scores were virtually unchanged for
the fourth straight year, but that won't stop educators and
interest groups from quarreling about the significance of those
numbers.
   Scores on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test
fell two points, to an average 428, while the national average on
the math section was unchanged at 476, according to the College
Board's annual report released Monday.
   Both portions of the multiple-choice exam taken each year by 1.1
million college-bound students are scored on a scale of 200-800,
with a combined 1600 being perfect.
   The combined math-verbal average of 904 marked the first decline
in eight years, and followed three years of no change at 906.
   Minority students, however, continued a decade-long pattern of
impressive gains.
   National averages on the ACT, the predominant college entrance
exam in 28 states mostly in the West and Midwest, also were little
changed. The approximately 1 million students who took the ACT last
school year averaged 18.8 on a scale of 1-36, up slightly from the
18.7 average the year before, according to the American College
Testing Program, the Iowa City, Iowa-based organization that
administers the test.
   The College Board painted the ``stability'' of test scores as
good news of a sort. Board president Donald Stewart said scores are
holding up well despite a 13 percent increase in the number of
test-takers in the last two years alone. More test-takers usually
bring down the averages.
   But to a nation that's heard much talk for five years from
politicians and educators about how reform would transform school
life, the latest SAT news was bound to be disappointing.
   In a statement Monday, Education Secretary William J. Bennett
blamed the school establishment for the falloff in scores: ``No
medals for America in this news. I said in April that `the absolute
level at which our improvements are taking place is unacceptably
low.' Today it's a bit lower, and still not acceptable. C'mon,
team! Back into training.''
   Added Scott Thomson, executive director of the National
Association of Secondary School Principals: ``We are always
disappointed when the scores don't improve each year, because
secondary schools are more rigorous than they were five years ago.
   ``If the impact doesn't show in the next year or two, then we
really have to go back and seriously reexamine the problems,''
Thomson said.
   The flat SAT scores may, in fact, be evidence of what American
Federation of Teachers leader Albert Shanker and others have said
recently: that reform has only nipped at the margins of classroom
life in all but a few school districts. For most children, nothing
much has changed.
   ``There's no question that graduation requirements have changed.
Students are taking more math and other academic subjects than five
years ago,'' said Thomson. ``But has reform changed the way
teachers instruct in class? Has there been a profound change in
student learning? The answer is no.''
   Apart from the national averages, the College Board released
numbers showing how blacks and other minorities compared with
whites, males with females, and states with each other _ enough
statistical grist for a year's worth of arguments among school
critics and advocates.
   Black students in the class of '88 averaged 353 on the verbal
portion, up two points, and math scores rose seven points to 384 _
especially heartening since the number of black test-takers rose 39
percent in three years from 70,156 in 1985 to 97,483 last year.
   Scores by blacks have risen 51 points since 1976, as the scores
of all test-takers gained only one point.
   But the gulf between blacks and whites remains 198 points. And
recent gains have not stilled standardized test critics who accuse
the SAT of cultural and racial bias.
   Nonetheless, higher SATs by minority students provide arguments
for those in favor of continuing and expanding Head Start and other
federal education programs started in the 1960s and 1970s that the
College Board and others now credit with helping boost scores in
the 1980s.
   A more subtle issue is the persistent gap between males and
females. Males scored an average 498 math and 435 verbal; females
scored 455 math, 422 verbal. Test critics including FairTest of
Cambridge, Mass., have charged that the SAT is biased against women
in its wording and content. College Board officials deny that and
offer figures showing that females take less demanding studies.
   The board said that 59 percent of female test-takers took four
years of math, compared with 68 percent of males. And while 43
percent of males had four years of natural science study, only 32
percent of females did.

   An explosion in a private fireworks factory
killed five people, including the owners and their 12-year-old son,
and injured nine, a newspaper Daily reported today
   The Guangming Daily said the Aug. 23 blast was triggered when
the 12-year-old, who worked at the factory, mishandled fuses. He
and the four other victims died in the hospital.
   The paper did not explain the delay in reporting the accident,
the second fireworks explosion in fourth months in coastal Zhejiang
province's Congnan County. In June, an explosion at another factory
injured 15 workers, including 13 children.
   Safety standards generally are low in China's more than 90,000
small-scale private and township-run fireworks factories, and
accidents are common. The most recent government statistic says 644
fireworks factory employees were killed in accidents in 1986.
   Eighteen people died last December in a nearby Jiangxi province
factory where untrained workers were instructed to cut the
fireworks' fuses by hand.
   China has begun drafting workplace safety regulations but
enforcement is lax.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis will step
forward to take questions in their first presidential debate
Sunday, but it remains unclear who will be asking those questions.
   Dukakis, the Democratic hopeful, proposed Monday that the four
commercial television network news anchormen be the moderator and
panelists, sources familiar with the negotiations said.
   Bush, the GOP candidate, had his own list of four possible
peacekeepers and 10 questioners from both electronic and print
journalism.
   By late Monday, the question of questioners was still being
debated by Bush and Dukakis aides as the Sunday date for the
face-off at Wake Forest University in North Carolina drew closer.
   The last-minute sparring is typical of presidential campaigns,
complete with accusations that the other side is breaking their
agreement not to talk about any of the arrangements.
   The first debate is sponsored by the parties' commission on
debates. The second presidential debate, due Oct. 13 or Oct. 15 in
Los Angeles, is sponsored by the League of Women Voters.
   This most recent volley between the campaigns erupted Monday,
when Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas called Bush campaign
chairman James Baker to propose the four-anchor idea for all three
debates.
   Sources who spoke only on the condition they not be identified
said Brountas suggested that the anchors from CBS News, ABC News,
NBC News and the Cable News Network be the moderators and
questioners during both presidential debates and the vice president
debate scheduled Oct. 5 in Omaha.
   That would mean CBS's Dan Rather, NBC's Tom Brokaw, ABC's Peter
Jennings and probably CNN's Bernard Shaw would be on stage for all
three events. And contacts were made with the news organizations to
see if they would agree, one source said.
   `This is a television event,'' said one Dukakis aide of the
idea. ``We want to do what we can to make it an event that people
will pay attention to. We think that they anchors would make it a
bigger event ... More people would watch it.''
   Bush aides flatly rejected the Dukakis idea of all the
presidential debates as well as the vice presidential one.
   The idea is ``blatantly unfair to the print media and other
television correspondents,'' said one Bush aide.
   But a Dukakis aide said that their proposal was still on the
table, despite the Bush campaign's stance.
   The Bush source said the campaign responded later Monday with a
list of four proposed moderators and 10 panelists. The source would
not name any of them, saying only the list was made up of network
anchors, network correspondents and print representatives.
   The Bush source also accused the Dukakis campaign of violating
the agreement not to talk about such matters.
   ``We are operating under a written agreement of understanding
not to discuss the negotiations surrounding'' debate details, said
the aide. ``Obviously that has been violated,'' and thus the source
gave the Bush campaign position on the matters.
   While pre-debate squabbling is normal, the difference this year
is there is no third party _ such as the League of Women Voters _
as the moderator of the pre-debate debate.
   The two political parties tried to wrest the debate sponsorship
away from the league with the formation of the bipartisan debate
commission. But the league _ which has sponsored debates in the
past three presidential campaigns _ kept fighting for a role.
   When the two campaigns agreed to split sponsorship of the
debates, that left them to deal more directly with each other on
these pre-debate matters than in the past.

   Scores of people returned to salvage
possessions from the Santa Catarina riverbed, where a flash flood
spawned by Hurricane Gilbert devastated their homes, but most came
up empty.
   People lined the banks Monday, digging with their hands in the
muck. What was for decades a dry riverbed with thousands of homes
had become a mangled landscape of twisted metal and crumbled
concrete.
   Maria Costa, her husband and their six children, had lived on
the riverbed in a two-room home made of concrete blocks and tin.
Their clothing, furniture and new school books were washed away.
   ``We went yesterday to see it, but there wasn't a thing to
save,'' Ms. Costa said as she washed her 10-month-old son's diapers
in a bucket of water. ``Even the blocks were gone. Now where do we
go?'' she asked.
   More than 100 people were killed in the sudden, storm-whipped
rebirth Saturday of the Santa Catarina, which became a savage
torrent 10 feet deep and 450 feet wide as Hurricane Gilbert dumped
12 inches of rain on the city.
   ``We just got three blankets out and lost everything else,''
said Ramona Carrizales Lopez, sitting outside a shelter for the
homeless.
   Mrs. Lopez was among thousands of people who had built meager
homes in the riverbed that cuts through this industrial city in
northern Mexico's most populated region.
   The riverbed suddenly swelled with water, sweeping away entire
ramshackle communities, miles of roads and a sprawling sports
complex with miles of tennis and basketball courts, soccer and
baseball fields and jogging tracks.
   Four buses and other vehicles were dragged into the torrent. The
bus passengers are presumed to comprise most of the 100 people
confirmed dead.
   The Nuevo Leon state government said a ``considerable number''
of people were missing and 30,000 people were lodged in shelters
around the state.
   Alejandro Chapa, mayor of San Pedro-Garza Garcia, the suburb of
Monterrey hit hardest by the disaster, said Monday that his first
priority is to find better lodgings for the 7,000 homeless people
in his community.
   He said those people with homes on the riverbed that escaped
ruin would be allowed to return there only provisionally.
   ``We're asking for a place to put them,'' Chapa said. ``Houses
can be built pretty fast, but not in a month.''

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 6-14 with 1,125 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer, and interviews were conducted with the adult who had
the most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within three points of the poll's results,
19 times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ four
points, for example, for those who said they planned to vote and
had decided on a candidate.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, some totals may exceed
100:
   1. Do you plan to vote in this year's presidential election, or
not? Yes: 85 percent. No: 12 percent. Don't Know-No Answer: 2
percent.
   2a. (If yes) George Bush is the Republican nominee for president
and Michael Dukakis is the Democratic nominee. Have you definitely
decided which presidential candidate you'll vote for in this year's
election, or not? Yes: 66. No: 30. DK-NA: 4.
   2b. (If yes) Which presidential candidate will you definitely
vote for in this year's election? Bush: 56. Dukakis: 39. DK-NA: 5.
   2c. Are you leaning strongly to vote for one of the presidential
candidates, or haven't you made up your mind? Yes: 44. No: 50.
DK-NA: 6.
   2d. Which presidential candidate are you leaning strongly for in
this year's election? Bush: 53. Dukakis: 41. DK-NA: 6.
   3. Do you think the outcome of the election _ that is, whether
George Bush wins or Michael Dukakis wins _ will have a major impact
on your life, or won't have much impact on your life? Major: 45.
Not much: 45. DK-NA: 10.
   4. And do you think whether George Bush wins or Michael Dukakis
wins will have a major impact on the future of the country, or
won't have much impact on the future of the country? Major: 71. Not
much: 20. DK-NA: 9.
   5. If George Bush wins, do you think that as president he will

<HEAD>Army Scraps High-Level Biological Warfare Lab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOOELE ARMY DEPOT, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army's decision to scrap
plans for a high-level biological warfare test lab in Utah has
drawn praise from state officials, but an environmentalist says
residents still can't rest easy.
   The Army announced Monday it will no longer seek approval for
the lab designed for experiments with genetically altered microbes
or deadly micro-organisms for which there are no known antidotes.
   Instead, Army officials said, they will downgrade the proposed
``biosafety level 4'' laboratory at Dugway Proving Ground to a new
$5.3 million level-3 lab where scientists can experiment with
biological agents for which there are vaccines or cures.
   ``The people of Utah are still at more risk,'' said Jeremy
Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington, D.C.
``It's easier for viruses to get out of this facility than the one
they proposed. The chance of a micro-organism escaping is low. But
if one does escape, it could be catastrophic.''
   Rifkin said his organization, which brought legal action forcing
the Army to conduct a more extensive environmental assessment of
the proposed lab, would seek another injunction if the Army went
ahead with its plans without a new environmental impact study.
   Michael Owen, the Army's deputy assistant secretary for
installations and logistics, said the level-3 lab would be used for
tests of materials and defenses against biological attack similar
to those conducted at Dugway since the early 1950s in a lab that
now is outdated.
   ``The Army's decision is based on an extensive evaluation of the
requirements for biological defense,'' Owen said. ``Existing Army
BL4 facilities will be used to satisfy any future needs for
material testing that requires a containment level higher than
BL3.''
   The Army's original draft environmental statement, published in
February, said the higher-level lab would be used only for level-3
experiments, but it did not rule out experiments with more exotic
and deadly agents in the future.
   Owen said the final environmental impact statement due next
spring would identify the level-3 lab as ``the preferred
alternative for construction.'' The draft document had listed it
only as a possible alternative, concluding a level-4 lab would be
safer.
   Utah's congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Norm
Bangerter praised the Army's decision. In March, Bangerter had
vowed to block construction of a higher-level lab, including
withholding state construction permits, and later met with Army
officials to seek a compromise.
   ``I appreciate the Army's new-found willingness to compromise
with the people of Utah and negotiate with me as governor on
matters which affect the state and its citizens,'' Bangerter said.
   The governor said he would announce within days the composition
of a civilian-scientist oversight committee to monitor testing at
the desert outpost 70 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.
   ``I will insist the open process continue and the Army shares
with the people in the state information regarding what testing is
being performed in Utah,'' Bangerter said.
   During a public comment period that ended Aug. 2, the Army
received 107 comments, 103 of which opposed building the facility.
   Owen said the outcry over the Army's initial plan was ``not the
sole determining factor in the decision,'' but he added, ``we try
to be good neighbors.''
   ``There was never a decision to back down or away from, as
such,'' he said. ``We did not have a decision prior to now.''
   Owen said there are five higher-level containment labs in the
United States where the Army could conduct such tests, if needed,
including its own lab at Fort Detrick, Md.
   On Monday night, 100 people attended an Army hearing at Tooele
Army Depot on the draft environmental impact statement governing
the Pentagon's biological defense research program. The document
concluded that the program ``does not create significant adverse
impacts on the quality of the environment'' and perceived risks are
``very much exaggerated.''
   It also rejected the idea of a non-military management of the
testing program, saying it would not mute controversies relating to
such issues as genetic engineering, highly infectious organisms or
aerosol testing.
   The United States abandoned research into offensive biological
weapons in 1969 and later signed a treaty banning their use or
possession. The Army continues to conduct research into defensive
measures against biological warfare, such as masks and vaccines.

   Crews repairing a dam accidentally killed
thousands of fish by reducing the flow into the Oswego River, and
anglers here for the fishing season are being assaulted by the
stench of rotting salmon and trout.
   ``I didn't know what to think. Everywhere you walked there was
dead fish,'' said Edward Hill of Trevose, Pa., one of the thousands
of fishermen who come to this Lake Ontario city each fall.
   The fish were killed Wednesday when a Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.
crew decided to do some work on a dam, and reduced the flow of
water in the river, officials said. That left thousands of big
fish, about 3 feet long and 20-30 pounds, stranded in shallow pools
or flopping on rocks.
   ``They (the utility) could not have picked a worse time to do
this,'' Cliff Creech, regional fisheries manager for the state
Department of Environmental Conservation, said Monday. ``I would
say a substantial portion of the fall salmon run has been wiped
out.''
   Each fall, from Labor Day to mid-October, Chinook and Coho
salmon and rainbow and brown trout swim out of Lake Ontario and up
the Oswego River to spawn. Unless they're caught, they die shortly
after laying their eggs in the river.
   Creech said he believes the fish kill will be a major blow for
the area, which takes in an estimated $150 million from fishing
each year.
   For the first weekend alone, from Sept. 10-11, 2,500 anglers
showed up.
   ``The season continues into October,'' Creech said from his
office in Cortland. ``Don't you think that some guy who hears about
this is going to go somewhere else or do something else?''
   Nigel Ciurleo, who runs Bare Bones Bait & Tackle Shop up the
road from the fish kill, said it's too early to tell what kind of
effect it will have on business.
   ``All I know is that there's 3,000 fish or whatever that
nobody's going to catch and that's got to have some kind of
impact,'' Ciurleo said.
   The utility agreed to start cleaning up the rotting fish today,
said Niagara Mohawk spokesman Bill Romano.
   Romano said the utility had been trying to install wooden
structures on top of Varick Dam, one of six on the Oswego, to
better control water flow over the dam.
   In doing the work, crews allowed the part of the river in front
of the dam to drain, Romano said.
   Many of the discolored fish washed into the Oswego Eastside
Marina, surrounding expensive yachts and floating under the docks.
   ``It's a travesty,'' said Connell Raate, a charter boat operator
at the marina. ``This is going to prove to be an economic disaster
for the city.
   ``It smells like a sewer. You're not going to want to fish or
use your boat with that kind of stink,'' Raate said.
   Eli Rapaport, a spokesman for Mayor John Sullivan, said he
didn't think it was fair to characterize the dead fish as a major
blow to Oswego's tourism.
   ``You should have been here yesterday when we had fishermen
shoulder-to-shoulder pulling up live fighting salmon out of the
river,'' Rapaport said. ``I don't think we'll suffer any economic
hardship.''

<HEAD>First Talks In Three Months Break Off</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan government and rebel leaders
broke off their first talks in three months after failing to agree
on a new site for resuming peace negotiations.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua accused the rebels, known
as Contras, of seeking to avoid negotiations in hopes of receiving
new U.S. military aid.
   The rebel delegation rejected the government's demand that
future talks resume in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua, chief
rebel delegate Roberto Ferrey said after Monday's four-hour meeting.
   He said the rebels proposed Guatemala, Costa Rica or the
Dominican Republic as the negotiating site.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Tinoco, head of the government
delegation, said the leftist Sandinistas were sticking by their
position that the talks be held in Managua.
   Monday's meeting was called as a preliminary step to resuming
high-level talks to end the 7-year civil war. Those negotiations
broke down June 9.
   No date for another meeting was announced.
   In Managua on Monday night, Ortega noted that his government had
bowed to rebel demands to hold previous talks in Nicaragua. He
accused the rebels of deliberately trying to make negotiations
impossible in a bid to receive renewed U.S. military aid.
   ``The Yankees are interested, through the Contras, in trying to
show Nicaragua has an intransigent position ... to approve military
aid for the counterrevolutionaries. This is the objective,'' Ortega
declared.
   ``We should speak with (President) Reagan. We should speak to
those who pay the gunslingers and not the gunslingers,'' he said in
remarks broadcast by state-run radio.
   Ferrey renewed a rebel proposal that high-level talks be held
Sept. 26-28, but not in Managua.
   His delegation also demanded the government release more than 40
opposition activists arrested during demonstrations in July and
guarantee freedom of expression before further talks are held.
   For his part, Tinoco reiterated the government's demand that the
Contras free 66 prisoners of war being held in Honduras.
   In March, the two sides signed a preliminary cease-fure accord
and agreed to seek a negotiated settlement to the conflict the
government says has killed 28,000 Nicaraguans.
   The agreement called on the rebels to lay down their arms in
exchange for democratic reforms.
   Shortly before peace talks broke off in June, the Sandinistas
proposed a timetable for disarmament and political reforms. But the
Contras rejected the plan, saying it did not go far enough. They
demanded freedom for political prisoners and democratic reforms in
Nicaragua before disarming.
   Direct U.S. military aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29. Non-lethal
U.S. aid to the Contras is distributed only in Honduras.
   About 9,000 rebel fighters have fled Nicaragua during the past
four months for base camps inside Honduras to receive new supplies
of uniforms and food.

   Share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Tuesday while the U.S. dollar inched up against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 134.15 yen, up 0.35 yen from Monday's close
of 133.80 yen. After opening at 133.62 yen, the currency gained
further ground during the day's session, moving within a range of
133.57-134.15 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues plunged 352.42
points, or 1.26 percent, to finish the day's session at 27,548.58.
The market's main index dropped sharply at the start of trading
Tuesday and continued its downward spiral to record the largest
single-day decline since Sept. 10, when the index lost 431.69
points.
   Prices were lower across the board with the exception of a few
pulp and paper issues, according to traders.
   A dealer with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo said share prices fell
``because of a selling drive among investors'' due to the decline
overnight in New York trading.
   ``There might be some concern over the emperor's (Hirohito)
condition among investors, but it's not a major factor affecting
trading,'' the dealer said.
   But other dealers said buy orders were on the rise for
paper-related issues in anticipation of a sharp increase in the
demand for paper in the near future. The demand for paper rises
with the death of any member of the imperial family as government
and business offices print large volumes of announcements.
   Aging Emperor Hirohito vomited blood late Monday and was given
two blood transfusions. Palace officials maintained that his
condition was ``nothing to be concerned about.''
   In foreign exchange, the dollar opened at 133.62 yen, down 0.18
yen from Monday's close, and was trading at 133.77 yen by late
morning.

<HEAD>Teamsters Delay Candidate Endorsement Until Mid-October</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is
giving its members more time to vote on their presidential
preference, putting off the union's possible endorsement of a
candidate until mid-October.
   ``My guess is that we're not going to do any endorsement until
our next board meeting Oct. 17,'' Teamsters spokesman Duke Zeller
said Monday.
   Zeller said the 1.6 million-member union has extended until
Sept. 30 the deadline for the rank and file to return poll ballots
on presidential preferences that were mailed to them three weeks
ago.
   Zeller said 10,000 to 12,000 of the ballots have been returned
to Teamsters' headquarters here but have not been tallied.
   With the extended deadline, he said, the responses cannot be
tabulated and analyzed before the next meeting of the union's
18-member executive board Oct. 17-19 in Orlando, Fla.
   The Teamsters were among three of the AFL-CIO's 91 affiliated
unions that abstained last month from the labor federation's
overwhelming endorsement of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Until the death of former Teamster President Jackie Presser in
June, union officials had expected the executive board to endorse
Dukakis.
   Several union officials have said the Justice Department's
indictment of Presser in 1986 and a civil suit in June aimed at
taking control of the Teamsters as a corrupt organization have
soured relations with President Reagan and Vice President George
Bush.
   The new Teamster president, William McCarthy of Boston, is known
to dislike Dukakis.
   One Teamster official, speaking only on condition that he not be
identified, said he does not expect the executive board to make any
endorsement this year unless the rank-and-file poll shows
overwhelming support for Dukakis.
   The Teamsters were the only major union to endorse Reagan in
1980 and 1984, although with less enthusiasm the second time. It
made no endorsement in the 1976 race which Jimmy Carter won against
President Ford.
   Since 1952 the Teamsters have endorsed four Democrats and four
Republicans.

   A Colombian national faces a mandatory
sentence of life in prison without parole after becoming the first
woman convicted under the 2-year-old federal drug kingpin law, a
prosecutor says.
   A jury deliberated 14 hours before returning a guilty verdict
Monday against Eucaris Ceballos for being the ``principal
administrator'' of a drug network that sold 2,600 to 3,300
kilograms of cocaine in New York City and New Jersey during a
seven-month period last year.
   The enterprise netted hundreds of millions of dollars,
authorities said.
   Ms. Ceballos, 54, also known as Dona Tulia, faces a mandatory
life prison sentence without parole, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Donna Yurow Sonageri. Setencing in U.S. District Court is scheduled
for Nov. 21.
   Defense attorney John S. Furlong said he will appeal.
   The jury will return Thursday to determine whether Ms. Ceballos,
who had lived in Hollywood, Fla., must surrender her home, to the
federal government. Under the federal racketeering law, property
used in the commission of certain crimes can be confiscated by
authorities.
   Prosecutors argued during the trial that Ms. Ceballos directed a
ring of Colombian drug dealers who distributed high-quality
cocaine. Three other defendants also were convicted of cocaine
conspiracy charges.
   Besides her conviction for being the ``principal administrator
of a continuing criminal enterprise,'' Ms. Ceballos was found
guilty of two counts of using the telephone in the commission of
crimes.
   Ms. Ceballos was the first woman ever convicted under the 1986
kingpin law, also called the federal principal administrator
statute, Ms. Sonageri said.
   The law carries strict penalties for anyone convicted of being
the leader of a drug network and supervising at least five people;
making a substantial income from the operation; violating at least
three felony drug laws; and distributing at least 150 kilograms of
cocaine during the operation.
   Ms. Ceballos was among 21 people arrested in November in the
case. With the exception of the four convicted Monday, the others
pleaded guilty to drug-related charges.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices plunged today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange in apparent reaction to Emperor Hirohito's failing health.
The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 352.42
points or 1.26 percent to close at 27,548.58. The main index, which
rapidly lost 169.20 points to move down to 27,731.80 points shortly
after the market opened, kept declining afterwards. It was the
fourth biggest one-day decline this year.
   In a moderate trading with volume on the first section estimated
at 1 billion shares, stock prices were lower across the board
except for a few print-related issues such as paper and pulp, said
an analyst with Nomura Securities.
   ``Investors were mainly selling stocks trying to get ready if
the worst happens to the emperor. Their concern was, for example,
the stock market might be closed in that case,'' he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Hirohita, 87, vomited blood Monday night, and was reported in
stable conditon. The emperor also has been reported to have
jaundice.
   Meanwhile, the dollar opened lower at 133.62 yen and finished
the day's trading at 134.15 yen, up 0.35 yen from Monday's close.
   A dealer with Mitsubishi Bank said the emperor's condition did
not affect trading on the foreign exchange market.
   The U.S. currency rose due to dollar-buying during the afternoon
trading, the dealer added, also speaking on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Protesters and soldiers retreated today
from Rangoon's streets, where troops shot to death at least 100
people during demonstrations against a military coup.
   The two sides fought sporadic clashes late Monday, with some
protesters hurling gasoline bombs at troops, who responded with
gunfire. Automatic weapons fire was heard from Seikkyi, across the
Rangoon River from the capital, and smoke could be seen billowing
from the village.
   At least 150 people were killed in the capital during protests
against Sunday's coup, which was led by armed forces commander Gen.
Saw Maung. No casualty figures were available from other cities,
where clashes were also reported.
   Today, downtown streets appeared deserted, peopled only with
some soldiers clearing roadblocks demonstrators had erected and
residents hurrying home after buying food at a few small shops.
   Most troops remained inside government buildings.
   Opposition leaders said they called off street protests to avoid
further bloodshed. They said government workers would protest by
continuing their strikes past Sept. 26, the new military regime's
deadline for returning to work on threat of dismissal.
   It was the first day without street demonstrations in the
capital since a round of rallies and strikes called to press for an
end to 26 years of repressive one-party rule began on Aug. 8 and
toppled hard-line President Sein Lwin four days later.
   Saw Maung said he ousted President Maung Maung on Sunday in a
bid to halt economic and social chaos and ensure democratic
elections _ which Maung had promised.
   Maung Maung, who took over Aug. 19 as Burma's first civilian
leader since 1962, had ended martial law and withdrawn soldiers
from the streets in the start of a series of concessions to
protesters.
   Troops returned in force after Saw Maung took power and enforced
his ban on public gatherings by shooting monks, students, striking
government workers and other unarmed demonstrators in Rangoon.
   Reporters who witnessed the confrontations said at least 100
people were killed on Monday, some of them shot by soldiers perched
on rooftops.
   About 40 demonstrators and 17 soldiers died in clashes around
the capital on Sunday night.
   Demonstrations also broke out in other cities, including
Mandalay, the second largest city in Burma.
   An Asian diplomat quoted doctors as saying 67 victims were taken
to Rangoon General Hospital on Monday. A military spokesman said
incomplete reports showed 23 people were killed and 23 wounded in
Rangoon and three other towns.
   Three key opposition leaders, reacting to the killings, vowed in
a joint statement Monday to ``continue our struggle for democracy
by various means until the goal is achieved.''
   The statement was issued by former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi, former
Defense Minister Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burma's
late independence leader. They had been demanding that Maung Maung
allow an interim government to conduct multiparty elections.
   Some diplomats suggested Saw Maung seized power to save the
Burma Socialist Program Party, the target of months of massive
street protests. Protesters blame the country's sole legal party
for 26 years of repression and isolationist police that has ruined
the economy.
   Burma has been in turmoil since students rioted 12 months ago
against government economic policies. Security forces killed scores
of protesters in March and June, and riots since July have forced
the resignations of longtime strongman Ne Win and his successor,
Sein Lwin. At least 112 people died in the rioting against Sein
Lwin.
   Protests continued after Maung Maung took over and widespread
strikes, demonstrations, looting and lawlessness have paralyzed the
economy and pushed the nation towards anarchy.

   About 100 protesters demanding the
Olympics be stopped burned a giant U.S. flag and chanted
anti-American slogans today outside a hotel where top Olympic
officials are staying.
   Riot police in green combat fatigues and black visored helmets
watched, but did not intervene as the radical students burned the
homemade flag after marching out of Donguk University in Seoul.
   ``Get out Yankees which support the dictatorial regime!'' the
students chanted as the 10-foot-high flag, doused in gasoline, went
up in a blast of orange flame.
   The protest was held outside the school gate, about 900 feet
away from the Shila Hotel, where the International Olympic
Committee and athletic officials have been staying during the Seoul
Games. The Olympics run through Oct. 2.
   Protesters dispersed peacefully after the incident and did not
try to approach the heavily-guarded hotel. Passers-by ignored the
protest.
   Students earlier held a rally on the campus to demand the
Olympics be halted because they claimed the Games were being used
by the United States, Japan and South Korea as a pretext to stage
military maneuvers.
   U.S. and Japanese forces are helping South Korea protect the
Olympics from any potential threat from communist North Korea. The
United States has about 42,000 troops based in the South under a
defense treaty.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to be
a co-host of the Games was rejected. South Korean officials fear
the North may stage a terrorist attack to disrupt the Games.
   Radical students, opposed to the Olympics because North Korea is
not participating, have staged a number of protests in recent days.
The protests have been small and mostly peaceful.
   Radicals at some other Seoul campuses handed out leaflets
criticizing the U.S. Olympic team for its behavior Saturday during
the Games' opening ceremony. Some American athletes wore Mickey
Mouse ears or carried signs with messages for relatives.
   ``The ugliness of Yankees was fully displayed during the opening
parade,'' the leaflets said.
   The International Olympic Committee criticized the behavior of
the American team in a letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee.

   American Greg Louganis today won his
second consecutive Olympic gold medal in men's springboard diving a
day after he hit the back of his head on the board.
   ``Fear is a part of anything that you do, whether it's in
business or sports,'' he said. ``You always have to take a chance
to have big rewards.''
   Sporting a bare spot on his head, Louganis gave a picturesque
performance and knocked off two Chinese challengers.
   He finished with 730.80. Tan Liangde of China, runner-up to
Louganis at the 1984 Summer Games, had 704.88 to win the silver
medal and Li Deliang of China finished with 665.28 to take the
bronze.
   The dive that marred Louganis' performance in Monday's
preliminaries caused him no problem today. The reverse
2{-somersault in the pike position earned three 9s, three 8.5s and
one 8. In the preliminaries, he received two zeros, one .5, three
1s, one 1.5 and five stitches.
   Louganis, 28, is seeking to become the first man to win the
springboard and platform events in consecutive Olympics. He
captured his first Olympic medal in 1976 when, at age 16, he
finished second in the platform competition.

<HEAD>Closing Arguments For Mexican Nationals Accused In Camarena Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug smuggler and a former Mexican police
official were pawns in a vendetta brought about by two countries
that desperately wanted to avenge the death of a U.S. drug agent,
defense attorneys say.
   ``Demand justice, not politics,'' attorney Michael Pancer urged
jurors Monday, insisting that Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, had
nothing to do with the 1985 torture-slaying of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   ``Rene Verdugo was offered up to you on a silver platter by the
police in Mexico,'' Pancer told the jury. ``Are you going to take
the scapegoat they offer you?''
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie scheduled the prosecutor's
rebuttal argument today, saying he would submit the case to the
jury later in the day.
   Yolanda Barrera, chief deputy federal public defender, said
another defendant, Raul Lopez Alvarez, 28, a former Guadalajara
homicide investigator, is a victim of the government's desire to
avenge the Camarena killing at any cost.
   She contended that the defendant's videotaped discussion of the
Camarena slaying with an undercover agent was typical of his
penchant for inventing stories to inflate his own importance.
   ``Mr. Lopez Alvarez ended up in this trial for acting like a
child,'' she said. ``He is a man caught up in the web of his own
lies. He told one lie too many.''
   Admitting that Verdugo was a marijuana smuggler, Pancer accused
Mexican officials of conspiring to blame Verdugo for Camarena's
killing. He said the U.S. government went along with the idea.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, tell the government of Mexico by your
verdict that you will not accept a scapegoat,'' said Pancer. ``Tell
them that you want the people who were really involved and who are
being protected down there.''
   He accused U.S. prosecutors of engaging in ``illusion, deception
and lies'' to convince jurors that Verdugo participated in
Camarena's torture and murder.
   ``The government has tried to appeal to your emotions,'' he
said, ``to make you feel guilty about rendering the correct
verdict. Don't let them do that.''
   Camarena was abducted in Guadalajara on Feb. 7, 1985. His body
and that of his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were found buried at
a remote ranch in Mexico several weeks later. They were severely
beaten and Camarena's skull was crushed.
   Prosecutors sought to show that Verdugo was a leader of a drug
cartel run by Rafael Caro Quintero and that he helped kill
Camarena. Authorities have depicted Caro as the mastermind of the
Camarena killing.
   The third defendant, Jesus Felix Gutierrez, 38, is accused of
helping Caro escape from Mexico after the killings.
   Key evidence against Verdugo is a strand of his hair found at
the Guadalajara home where Camarena is believed to have died and
the testimony of a witness who saw Verdugo at the house near the
time of Camarena's death.
   Nine men were indicted in Los Angeles in connection with the
slaying, but only three are on trial here. Caro, 33, and three
other defendants are in custody and awaiting trial on related
charges in Mexico. An eighth man has died and another is a fugitive.

   A former executive for Rockwell International
Corp. has pleaded guilty to charges that he schemed to double-bill
the Air Force by nearly $450,000 on contracts for a satellite
navigational system.
   In an agreement with prosecutors, Robert Zavodnick, a former
manager of major subcontracts at Rockwell, entered the plea Monday
to one count of conspiracy and one count of making false
statements, said Assistant U.S. Attorney George B. Newhouse Jr.
   U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall denied motions to dismiss
the conspiracy count and a count of criminal contempt on the part
of Rockwell, said Mary McMenimen, a spokeswoman for the
prosecutor's office.
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Rockwell spokesman Jeff
Charney. ``Rockwell intends to continue to defend itself vigorously
against the government's charges.''
   Zavodnick, 46, of Fountain Valley, is scheduled to be sentenced
Nov. 28, Newhouse said. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison and a $500,000 fine.
   The company, Zavodnick, and Donald Carter _ who was the
materials division director at the Seal Beach plant _ were named in
a 25-count federal indictment in January.
   Zavodnick has offered to testify for the government in exchange
for charges of mail fraud and another count of making false
statements being dropped, Newhouse said.
   Carter is scheduled for trial Oct. 18 on one count of
conspiracy, three counts of mail fraud and two counts of making
false statements, the prosecutor said.
   The indictment alleged the company and two men double-billed the
government for work on the NAVSTAR global navigation system that
uses radio signals from satellites to pinpoint locations on Earth.
   Rockwell received $446,283 in unlawful profits as a result, the
indictment said.

   More than 200 Burmese have fled into
bordering Thailand, saying they feared arrest and persecution by
the military regime that has seized power in their country,
officials said today.
   After escaping in motor launches from Victoria Point, Burma's
southernmost area, 108 Burmese students who ``felt their lives were
threatened'' arrived in the Thai city of Ranong on Sunday night,
Lt. Col. Sanit Komolvanich said.
   ``We are not turning them around today because we also fear for
their safety,'' Ranong's immigration chief said. ``They are being
detained until the situation returns to normal and then they all
must go back.''
   Another 101 students, Buddhist monks and others sought refuge in
the northern Thai border town of Mae Sot, crossing a frontier river
in boats or trekking on foot in heavy monsoon rains, district
official Niyom Jaikaew said.
   Authorities housed the refugees in a Buddhist temple, provided
food and urged them to return, Niyom said. He said 70 left late
Monday and the rest returned to Burma today.
   Students and monks have been at the forefront of massive
demonstrations to topple Burma's authoritarian government, but the
military stepped in over the weekend and ousted civilian President
Maung Maung.
   A senior immigration official in the northern Thai town of Mae
Sai said turmoil in Burma has reduced the usually busy border
trade, most of it conducted illegally between Thai merchants and
Burmese smugglers providing consumer goods for Burma's vast black
market.

<HEAD>Former Chief Astronaut Disappointed With Space Program Progress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former chief astronaut says the emphasis on the
space shuttle is to blame for a slowdown in America's space program.
   Astronaut John W. Young, who flew on the first manned Gemini
mission in 1965 and later walked on the moon, expressed
disappointment with the space program's progress in a recent
interview.
   ``It is almost 20 years since we landed people on the moon,''
said Young, 57. ``And if you had asked me after the moon landing
what we'd be doing in 20 years, I'd have said we'd have a base on
the moon in 20 years.''
   Young, now a safety and engineering trouble-shooter for Johnson
Space Center's director, commanded the first and ninth shuttle
flights while serving as chief astronaut for the National
Aeronautics and Space Admininstration.
   He said the shuttles on which NASA staked its future in the
early 1970s have never been the inexpensive, quickly refurbished
workhorses that their supporters promised.
   ``I never believed it could be that way,'' Young said. ``I
wasn't involved in selling it, but I was involved in the technical
details of helping design and build it, and it was too
complicated.''
   Young said the shuttle is capable of fulfilling its creators'
expectations, but tight budgets hurt it when NASA could not afford
to stockpile spare parts for quick repairs. And, he said, the
spacecraft's design can slow repairs because some areas are hard to
reach.
   He said that quick shuttle turnarounds and reflights and routine
Florida landings never panned out, nor is the shuttle an
inexpensive way to fly.
   The basic assumption that it pays to salvage and reuse each $15
million solid-fuel rocket booster may be wrong, Young said.
   He also said the delays are affecting the supply of flight-ready
astronauts. Fourteen astronauts who flew before the Jan. 28, 1986,
Challenger explosion decided not to wait for flights to resume. The
space center has 93 astronauts and is accepting applications
through July 1 for a 1990 astronaut class.
   ``I expect there's a lot of astronauts leaving because they see
the line at the end of the tunnel,'' Young said. ``The line they've
got to stand in to get a flight is so long.''

<HEAD>Court Considers Settlement For Buyers Of Discontinued Kodak
Cameras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Eastman Kodak Co. customers who
bought the company's discontinued instant cameras says only about
200 people have balked at a plan to give them $50 to $70 in cash
and coupons.
   Attorney Perry M. Berke told Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas
Rakowski on Monday that about 3.4 million people have been approved
for compensation.
   ``It demonstrates you have an overwhelming approval of the
settlement,'' Berke said.
   Rakowski, who presided over a hearing in the case, said he would
rule Sept. 26 on whether the proposed $195 million plan should be
accepted to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by customers.
   The cameras were rendered virtually useless in 1985 when a
federal court said the company had violated several Polaroid Co.
patents on instant film and cameras. That court ordered Kodak to
stop producing film for its line of instant cameras.
   Under the proposal, those who bought the cameras would receive
$19.50 to $52 in cash, with the balance made up in coupons for the
purchase of other Kodak products, said William Harte, one of the
lawyers for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit. The amount
would depend upon the model of camera the person owned, he said.
   ``It is clearly a generous settlement. It is clearly a fair
settlement,'' said William Campbell, a lawyer representing the
Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak.
   Critics of the plan say an insufficient amount of money is
involved, no provision exists to compensate for accessories like
camera bags and some steps toward getting a rebate were difficult.
   The proposed settlement is limited to U.S. owners. Kodak made 16
million of the instant cameras for domestic sale from 1976 to 1985.
   Harte said 4.3 million camera owners were notified of the
settlement proposal by direct mail, and 3.4 million have valid
claims. About 100,000 more filed claims that are being reviewed by
a court-appointed arbitrator, he said.
   The deadline for filing claims was Sept. 9, and those who have
not filed will not be able to get refunds, he added.
   Instant photography was invented by Edwin H. Land, founder of
Polaroid, and was first marketed in 1948. It enables users to view
a photographic print within moments of taking a picture.
   Polaroid retained a monopoly in the instant photography field
until 1976, when Kodak entered the market with a competing system.
   A week later, Polaroid sued Kodak, charging patent infringement.
   A federal judge in Boston sided with Polaroid. The U.S. Supreme
Court let stand lower court rulings when it refused to hear Kodak's
appeal in October 1986. Polaroid is seeking $5.7 billion in damages
from Kodak.

<TEXT>
   A new tropical depression with the potential to
strengthen formed in the eastern Atlantic as the remnants of
Hurricane Gilbert spread from Texas to Illinois.
   ``It's out there. There's no land in front of it or anything
else,'' Martin Nelson, National Hurricane Center meteorologist,
said Monday. ``It's got a chance.''
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, satellite pictures showed the 14th
depression of the Atlantic hurricane season was centered about 700
miles west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands off the west coast
of Africa.
   The system was moving west at 10 to 15 mph with sustained winds
estimated at 35 mph with higher gusts in squalls, forecasters said.
   ``Conditions appear favorable for strengthening and the
depression could become a tropical storm in the next 12 to 24
hours,'' said Max Mayfield, one of the center's hurricane
specialists.
   The depression, which would be called Helene if its winds reach
39 mph, formed while the last remains of Gilbert swept from Texas
to Illinois with heavy rain and flooding.
   Gilbert killed more than 200 people, left hundreds of thousands
of people homeless and caused more than $8 billion in damage as a
blew from the Caribbean to Mexico.
   Storms become hurricanes when sustained winds reach 74 mph.
Gilbert was the third hurricane of the season, which runs from June
1 to Nov. 30. September is the peak month for tropical weather
activity.

<TEXT>
   A fugitive wanted for taking hostages at a
newspaper is back in federal authorities' hands after disappearing
three weeks ago.
   Eddie Hatcher, 30, accused of holding up to 20 hostages at The
Robesonian in Lumberton on Feb. 1, was arrested Monday as he and an
attorney arrived on a Piedmont Airlines flight from Newark, N.J.,
just minutes before Hatcher's scheduled arraignment.
   Hatcher, an American Indian, and a second man charged in the
incident said they were protesting alleged corruption and
discrimination against minorities by Robeson County law enforcement
officials.
   The attorney, Ronald Kuby, of New York, declined to discuss his
client's whereabouts.
   When Hatcher was asked where he had been since his disappearance
Aug. 31, he responded, ``Over the rainbow.''
   U.S. Marshal Bill Berryhill said authorities did not know where
Hatcher had been. ``It's rather academic at this point, but yet
from an investigator's standpoint, tying up our investigation, we
need to try to find out where he's been,'' Berryhill said.
   Hatcher decided to surrender after the arraignment date was
announced last week, Kuby said.
   Airport security officers grabbed Hatcher and frisked him in a
covered passageway just outside the airplane door. A security
officer guarded the door into the terminal while officers cuffed
Hatcher's hands behind his back and led him to a car waiting on the
tarmac.
   While Hatcher was being taken into custody at the airport, his
case was called in a federal courtroom in downtown Raleigh.
   ``We notified them this morning to watch all flights coming into
Raleigh-Durham because we felt like with his arraignment today he
might come in,'' Berryhill said.
   He added that marshals had no tips that Hatcher would return to
Raleigh on Monday.
   Hatcher's sister, Ginger Clark, watched through an airport
window as officials led her brother to the waiting car.
   She sobbed, pounded on the window and waved in an attempt to get
her brother's attention as reporters and photographers stood around
her. Hatcher looked up and smiled at her.
   Aaron Clark, who had rented a limousine to take his brother to
the arraignment, grimaced when he saw his brother in custody.
   Hatcher, who was born John Edward Clark, adopted his
grandfather's family name after the elder man died in 1985.
   U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle entered a plea of innocent on
Hatcher's behalf, and set his trial to begin Sept. 26, the same day
that Hatcher's co-defendant, Timothy Jacobs, is scheduled to stand
trial.
   Hatcher disappeared after the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
revoked his bond. He was declared a fugitive after failing to
surrender to U.S. marshals in Raleigh.

   The dollar was little changed in subdued European
trading early today ahead of the release of U.S. economic reports
and a weekend meeting of the seven leading industrialized nations.
Gold prices were higher.
   Dealers said they doubted that the final revision of U.S. gross
national product figures for the second quarter, would stimulate
the markets. Dealers were anticipating a 3.3 percent growth rate in
the U.S. economy.
   The August rate of inflation was due to be released later in the
week.
   Dealers said market players were withdrawing to the sidelines
ahead of Saturday's opening meeting in Berlin of finance ministers
of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies.
   ``The market is very calm and should stay so as long as the
dollar is awaiting some new stimulus,'' said a dealer in Milan,
Italy.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar edged up 0.35 Japanese yen to a closing 134.15 yen.
Later, in London, it fell back to 133.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8690 West German marks, down from 1.8695
   _1.5785 Swiss francs, down from 1.5793
   _6.3545 French francs, up from 6.3520
   _2.1080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1100
   _1,392.25 Italian lire, down from 1,393.50
   _1.2192 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2194
   In London, the British pound held steady at $1.6785 dollars,
unchanged from Monday's late price.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $409.40 dollars a troy
ounce, up from $409.30 dollars bid late Monday. At midmorning, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$410.40.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $410.30, up from $408.50 bid
late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.72 dollars to close at a bid
$413.12.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.35 a troy
ounce, up from $6.28 bid late Monday.

   A vigorous cold front blasted its way through the central Great
Lakes region and the Ohio Valley today, bringing showers,
thunderstorms and strong, gusty winds.
   In lower Michigan, winds gusted to 70 mph at Mason, causing some
structural damage and downing trees and power lines.
   Thunderstorms produced strong, gusty winds over northern
Indiana, downing trees that blocked roads in some places. In
western and northern Indiana, thunderstorm rains flooded roads and
police reported small tornadoes in three counties.
   Showers were scattered across western parts of New York, central
Pennsylvania and sections of Maryland as warm air ahead of the cold
front pushed northeastward into cooler air covering New England.
   On Monday, tornadoes were reported over parts of central
Wisconsin as thunderstorms moved through. Early today, winds were
gusty from southern Minnesota into northern Illinois.
   Another cold front swept through the Pacific Northwest into the
northern Rockies and Great Basin on Monday evening. Showers and
thunderstorms were scattered over parts of Oregon, northern
California and Nevada.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the Gulf Coast states through the Appalachians and upper Ohio
Valley into the northern and eastern Great Lakes and much of New
England; numerous showers and thunderstorms over southern and
central New England; scattered showers from the northern Rockies
into northern parts of the Great Basin; gusty winds from the
central Plateau into central Wyoming.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s or 80s over much of
the nation; in the 60s from the Pacific Northwest through northern
Nevada into the northern Plains and the Great Lakes region; from
the upper 40s into the 50s over the northern Rockies; into the
lower 90s over the Gulf Coast states and into the upper 90s to near
100 degrees across the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 30
degrees at Custer, S.D., to 82 degrees at Phoenix.

   Three Soviet MiG-17 fighter jets roared
over New Mexico, tracked by the whirling arms of Chinese-built
early-warning radar hidden in a canyon.
   It was only a test.
   ``We want to understand what the guy we're up against can do,
what his equipment can do,'' Dave Tracy, director of the Defense
Department's Defense Test and Evaluation Support Agency, said
Monday.
   The agency is testing Soviet, Chinese and Warsaw Pact military
hardware at Kirtland Air Force Base just outside Albuquerque this
month to see how well it works, how long it takes to do its job and
what problems turn up, said Defense Department official James
Wilson.
   In Monday's test, the MiG-17s flew south from Kirtland into the
pinon-studded Manzano Mountains, where the radar waited. Down from
the radar site were antenna fields, trailers with technicians
peering into scopes and simulated artillery sites.
   U.S. A-7 attack jets from the New Mexico Air National Guard took
to the air to determine how quickly they could be picked up on the
Chinese radar and how swiftly an alert could be relayed to an
anti-aircraft missile site, Wilson said.
   The agency plans to use its foreign equipment to find out how
well U.S. hardware performs. For example, officials said, tests
might find out how easy it is to detect a new U.S. jet on Soviet
radar.
   The agency has spent the past year gathering Warsaw Pact
equipment ranging from radios to radar and from tracked vehicles to
fighter aircraft. Tracy and Wilson declined to say how the United
States acquired the hardware.
   Much of the equipment was displayed Monday at a Kirtland hangar.
Outside were MiGs and a troop transport plane; inside were tables
covered with radios and the components needed to keep them working,
as well as operating manuals written in Russian.
   While the MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters are older versions of what
Soviet pilots now fly, they remain in the air as part of the forces
of such countries as Cuba, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, East
Germany, Egypt and India, Tracy said.
   ``Just because it looks little and small doesn't mean it can't
hurt you,'' he said.
   The Soviet and Chinese radios on display, used by Warsaw Pact
countries, don't have the modern microchips found in U.S.
equipment, but instead use vacuum tubes _ technology developed in
the 1940s and 1950s.
   But what the equipment lacks in techological sophistication, it
makes up for in simplicity, Tracy said. Such radios are easy to
maintain, easy to use and very tough.
   Vacuum tubes are also less susceptible to the electromagnetic
pulses that would follow a nuclear detonationo and disrupt
communications and power, Tracy said.
   ``They are prepared to operate in a nuclear environment more
than we thought,'' he said.

   Bruce Springsteen teamed up with other major
rockers in the first U.S. concert of a worldwide tour aimed at
inspiring people to join Amnesty International's fight for human
rights.
   ``You have the opportunity to use your freedom to help free
others,'' said Springsteen, the closing act at Monday's sold-out
performance at John F. Kennedy Stadium.
   More than 75,000 people attended the 7{-hour show, concert
officials said. No major problems were reported.
   Joining Springsteen were Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman,
Senegalese singer Yousoou N'Dour, folk singer Joan Baez and
saxophonist Branford Marsalis.
   It wasn't the first time rock stars banded together for a good
cause at the stadium. In 1985, the arena was the site of the U.S.
half of the Live Aid concert to fight hunger.
   Monday's concert opened with the entire group singing the reggae
anthem, ``Get Up, Stand Up.'' Baez followed with the the spiritual,
``Oh, Freedom.''
   The crowd listened to N'Dour's brand of African rhythms and
Chapman's songs of protest and lament. But it wasn't until Sting
performed more familiar songs of his own and his former band, The
Police, that the crowd began to respond.
   Gabriel, the driving force behind the tour, reminded the crowd
about the more serious aspects of the tour. Throwing his fist into
the air, he sang ``Biko,'' in memory of Steven Biko, the black
South African political activist who died while imprisoned in the
apartheid state.
   Springsteen, a New Jersey native, was clearly the favorite, as
calls for ``Bruce'' drowned out the audio from an animated video
illustrating the tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
   London-based Amnesty International, which monitors human rights
abuses and political prisoners, distributed literature and asked
for signatures on petitions supporting the declaration. The
organization, with a worldwide membership of 750,000, won the 1977
Nobel Peace Prize.
   Amnesty International Executive Director Jack Healey said the
group has collected about 500,000 signatures so far, and half of
those attending the Philadelphia concert signed the Amnesty
petition.
   ``Sign it, use it, believe in it,'' he encouraged the crowd.
   Lisa Frohne, a 28-year-old homemaker from Brewster, N.Y., said
the concert had galvanized her to start writing letters for Amnesty
International.
   ``It enlightens you to what's going on. Day-to-day life makes
you forget,'' she said. ``A concert like this brings that out. It
slaps you in the face.''
   But Jay Schwartz, a 46-year-old sales representative from
Sicklerville, N.J., was skeptical about the concert's message
reaching many people.
   ``It's good music. Most of them are political songs, but I don't
think it's registering in people's heads,'' he said.
   The budget for the tour, which began in London Sept. 2, is
estimated at $23 million. Although performers are donating their
time, organizers said they expect expenses to outstrip ticket
sales. The tour is partially underwritten with a $10 million
commitment from footwear manufacturer Reebok International.
   The tour is due in Los Angeles Sept. 21 and San Francisco Sept.
23. Tour officials said they expect to play to more than a million
people in 14 countries and are negotiating to perform in the Soviet
Union.

   Republican Party National Chairman
Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. got his governors mixed up.
   At a GOP rally Monday, he introduced Florida Gov. Bob Martinez
as the governor of Texas and made Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate, the governor of
Florida.
   ``You've been traveling too much,'' Martinez said after
Fahrenkopf introduced him as the governor of Texas. Bill Clements
is the governor of Texas.
   ``I don't make mistakes like that, and I apologize for that,''
said Fahrenkopf, who then slipped again.
   ``I'm going to be in Texas, unfortunately, later in the day,''
he tried to explain.
   Fahrenkopf got Dukakis' state switched earlier while criticizing
the Democratic candidate's record as governor of Massachusetts.
   The GOP chairman was critical of a national television ad in
which Dukakis takes credit for balancing 10 straight budgets in his
home state.
   ``The facts are ... the constitution of the state of Florida
requires a balanced budget,'' Fahrenkopf said.

<HEAD>Flight Surgeon: Recruit Shouldn't Have Been In Pool</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recruit who drowned during
rescue-swimmer training had been declared unfit for the course
because of his intense fear of being dragged under water, a Navy
doctor testified at a sailor's court-martial.
   After Lt. Cmdr. David Shiveley's testimony, the defense rested
its case Monday in the trial of Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael
Combe, 28, of Tempe, Ariz.
   The defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter, battery
and conspiracy in the March 2 death of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki
in a training pool at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   The trial reopens Thursday with closing arguments.
   The military judge, Cmdr. Newell D. Krogmann, was to meet today
with lawyers to prepare instructions for the panel of five officers
hearing the case. One panel member asked for an additional day's
delay because Wednesday is Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday, said Lt.
Cmdr. Dennis Hessler, a Navy spokesman.
   Shiveley conceded Monday the system probably broke down by
allowing the 19-year-old recruit from Appleton, Wis., to return to
the Navy Rescue Swimmer School after Shiveley disqualified him from
further training.
   ``He related a pretty intense fear to me,'' said Shiveley, who
saw Mirecki a month before his death. ``I diagnosed him as possibly
having a phobia.''
   A psychologist disagreed with Shiveley's diagnosis and found
Mirecki fit for training, but neither doctor consulted the other.
   Shiveley said Mirecki should have been sent back to him before
being readmitted.
   Shiveley said while a noncommissioned officer such as Combe
cannot be expected to detect a phobia, he should have recognized
Mirecki's panic.
   Witnesses have testified Mirecki panicked and climbed out of the
pool, grabbing an equipment rack as instructors converged on him.
Mirecki was pulled free and thrown into the pool where Combe dunked
him and grabbed him in a head hold, witnesses say.
   A pathologist has testified Mirecki's phobia triggered heart
failure, then drowning.
   Two fellow instructors, who testified under immunity, backed up
testimony by Combe, who denied he helped push Mirecki back into the
pool and claimed the recruit completed a lifesaving maneuver, in
which he freed himself from a head hold, just seconds before
collapsing.

   An overloaded ferry sank in a south China river,
killing 61 people and leaving one missing, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported today.
   The sinking Sunday was the eighth major boat accident since July
and brought the total of people killed to more than 320, according
to official figures. Investigators have attributed most of the
accidents to human error.
   Xinhua said more than 80 passengers were on the ferry when it
sank in a river in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that
borders Vietnam. It said the boat was overloaded but did not give
its capacity or say if the overloading caused it to sink.
   The Ministry of Communications, which has responsiblity for
inland water navigation, announced last month it had begun an
investigation into the safety of China's river vessels to determine
if standards should be tightened.
   That move followed the July 21 capsizing of a ferry on the Min
River in southwestern Sichuan province, in which 133 people died,
and the July 25 sinking of a passenger boat on the Yangtze River in
which 71 drowned.

<HEAD>Congressman Says War on Drugs Becomes War on Constitution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional authority on the Constitution
predicted today that a controversial anti-drug bill will pass the
House this week by a wide margin despite measures he called
``stupid'' and ``outrageous'' attacks on the Bill of Rights.
   ``I think the bill will pass overwhelmingly because there's some
kind of hysteria on Capitol Hill,'' said Rep. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Justice subcommittee on civil and
constitutional rights.
   He said in an interview on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program
that four tough amendments added on bipartisan votes last week are
``pretty awful.'' But he said congressmen will vote for the bill
``no matter what the provisions are, if one can appear to be tough
on drugs ... it'll pass big.''
   Asked whether the House was effectively waging a ``war on the
Bill of Rights,'' Edwards said, ``Yes, that's what is happening.''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in the same interview, termed Edwards'
objections ``nonsense.''
   ``I think (the) provisions are constitutional. And I think they
have the support of the majority of the members,'' Hyde said.
   The House is expected to vote on the final bill Thursday.
Approval would mean the differences with a Senate version would
have to be worked out by a conference committee of the two chambers.
   The amendments that have drawn scorn from civil libertarians
would establish:
   _A federal death penalty for those convicted of murder in a
drug-related crime.
   _Denial of federal welfare and other benefits to repeat drug
offenders.
   _An exception to the so-called exclusionary rule that would
allow into court evidence seized without a search warrant.
   _A civil fine of up to $10,000 for individuals accused of
possessing even small amounts of drugs, whether or not there is a
conviction.
   Edwards said the fine would be ``an outrage. Never before in
American history have we had civil penalties in criminal matters.''
   And he said supporters of tough measures against drug
trafficking were defeating their own efforts with the death penalty
provision.
   ``The stupid part about this amendment is that hereafter, if the
bill passes, we won't be able to extradict drug offenders from
overseas because countries that don't have the death penalty _ and
most don't _ just won't send them back to the United States to be
executed,'' said Edwards.

<HEAD>Millions Exposed to Disease, Diarrhea Cases Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HASAN SAEED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of people in the capital have
been exposed to serious health hazards by drinking contaminated
water, and the number of cases of diarrhea has soared in the past
24 hours, officials said today.
   ``In most cases the water flowing out of the pipes is unfit for
drinking,'' an official at the Environmental Pollution Control
Board said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The floods that inundated three-fourths of Bangladesh three
weeks ago have claimed at least 2,000 lives, according to Dhaka
newspapers. They said one-fourth of the deaths were caused by
diarrhea, while the others were from drowning, snake bites and
houses collapsing. The government, whose count is generally
considered low, puts the total number of deaths at about 1,000.
   The newspapers say at least one million of Bangladesh's 110
million people have been stricken by diarrhea in the past four
weeks.
   The government reported 618,656 diarrhea cases, including 47,361
in the past 24 hours. It said 268 people have died of diarrhea.
   The pollution control official said tests Sunday showed the
count of coliform bacteria, linked to intestinal diseases, in tap
water was as high as 4,000 per hundred milliliters in some areas of
Dhaka. He said the permissible limit was 4 per hundred milliliters.
   Water samples collected at government relief camps showed a
coliform bacteria count of up to 1,600 per hundred milliliters, he
added.
   Excessive quantities of coliform bacteria in drinking water can
cause diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice and pneumonia.
   Floodwaters that covered about three-fourths of Dhaka, a city of
6 million, leaked into municipal water pipes. The official said
many pipes had leaks that could not be repaired because they were
under water.
   As the floodwaters recede, the municipal corporation has been
closing the 465 refugee centers set up in schools and colleges so
classes can resume. Some of the refugees said they had nowhere to
go.
   Rahimullah, a 45-year-old day laborer, went from door to door
today with his three children. ``After trying for the last three
days to get a job, I am now begging for food for my family,'' he
said.
   Ismail Hossain, 45, said he had come to Dhaka after his house in
Khadun, 10 miles south of the capital, was flooded.
   ``I have no money to rebuild the house and start life afresh,''
he said. ``Nobody in the village is willing to extend a loan to
me.''
   A Relief Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said millions affected by the floods were faced with the same
problems.
   The government estimates that 40 million people _ more than
one-fourth of the country's population _ were directly affected by
the flood. It defines those directly affected as having lost
relatives, homes, crops or other property.
   Although Bangladesh, a low-lying country shredded by mighty
rivers and cobweb-like networks of tributaries, is regularly hit by
floods, this summer's deluge is the worst in memory.
   Even before the present flood, Bangladesh was one of the world's
poorest nations with a per capita annual income of $150 and one of
its biggest foreign aid recipients, receiving more than $2 billion
this year.

<HEAD>Bush In Virtual Tie In New York, Maintains Nebraska and
Mississippi</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 3 new grafs after pvs 6th graf bgng, The results,
with new poll on Dukakis tank ride.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush was in an effective tie with Democrat Michael
Dukakis in New York, the cornerstone of the industrial Northeast,
while the Republican presidential nominee held substantial
advantages in polls conducted in Mississippi and Nebraska.
   A poll released Monday by the Marist College Institute for
Public Opinion showed Dukakis, the Democratic candidate, leading
Bush by 48-42 percent among likely voters.
   But the margin of error of four percentage points either way
erased Dukakis' seeming advantage. Ten percent of those polled said
they were undecided.
   The statistical dead heat came even though 65 percent of
potential New York voters said Bush ``has the experience to be
president'' and only 23 percent named the Democrat.
   At the same time, 52 percent said the vice president ``has the
ability to handle an international crisis,'' while 28 percent said
that of Dukakis. Nonetheless, when it comes to who can provide
strong leadership, Dukakis was on top, 43 percent to 36 percent,
among New Yorkers questioned.
   The results were similar to a Marist poll in March that gave
Dukakis a 47-41 percentage advantage.
   A separate poll indicated that Dukakis lost rather than gained
voter support when he posed last week wearing a helmet and riding
an M-1 battle tank at a defense contractor's plant in Michigan.
   In a telephone survey of 1,002 registered voters around the
country last Friday through Sunday, conducted for the Boston Herald
and station WBZ-TV in Boston, 25 percent said they were less likely
to vote for Dukakis based on what they had seen or heard about the
tank ride.
   Seven percent said the ride made them more likely to vote for
Dukakis, according to the poll, and more than 60 percent said they
either knew nothing about it or it had no impact on how they would
vote. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percent.
   With 36 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the
presidency, New York carries more weight than any other single
state in the traditionally-Democratic Northeast.
   New York has been considered a Dukakis stronghold, in part
because Democrats have a 3-2 enrollment edge over Republicans and
also because Dukakis is from a neighboring state.
   But the state was captured by Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980
and again in 1984. In 1984, Cuomo headed up Democratic candidate
Walter Mondale's New York effort and was unable to deliver the
state for the former vice president.
   Polls released Monday in Mississippi and Nebraska, which
respectively have seven and five electoral votes, indicated Bush is
holding his comfortable leads in those states.
   Nebraskans favored Bush by 44-33 percent, according to an Omaha
World-Herald poll published Monday. The margin of error in the
survey of 755 registered voters conducted Sept. 14-15 by SRI
Research Inc. was plus or minus four percentage points.
   In Mississippi, a telephone survey over last weekend by Rick
Knox and Associates showed Bush the preferred choice of 49 percent
of those polled while Dukakis the pick of only 34 percent. The poll
of 1,000 registered voters showed just about the same margin as a
survey conducted a month ago.
   It had a margin of error of five percentage points in either
direction, however.
   The Marist poll conducted last week surveyed 601 New York voters
said to be likely to cast ballots in the Nov. 8 election.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police sergeant responding to a fatal shooting
outside a housing project discovered that the victim was his own
stepson in a tragedy that his commander called ``every cop's worst
nightmare.''
   Sgt. Lonnie Owens, 43, found the body of his 19-year-old
stepson, Norris Williams, on the sidewalk near the Brooklyn project
early Sunday. The teen-ager had been shot in the chest with a 9mm
bullet and was pronounced dead at the scene.
   Less than six hours later, Carlos Davis, 18, of Brooklyn was
arrested and charged with murder and possession of an illegal
handgun. The two youths had had a long-running dispute, police said.
   ``It's every cop's worst nightmare,'' Capt. John P. Harkins,
commanding officer of the 75th Precinct, told New York Newsday.
   Owens is taking time off from work until he feels up to coming
back, Harkins said.
   He described Owens as ``a nice, quiet man, a good cop.''
   Owens joined the Police Department in 1969 and was promoted to
sergeant in 1986. He has been assigned to the 75th Precinct for
more than two years, and has received eight commendations and
citations for outstanding police work.
   Williams was the youngest of Owens' three stepsons.

   Fearful that the FBI would nab them,
high-ranking aides to Republican assemblymen erased computer
records that showed they worked on political campaigns on state
time, a newspaper reported today.
   GOP sources told the Los Angeles Times that after the material
was deleted, earlier computer printouts and political fund-raising
letters were moved from the offices.
   The aides were worried that FBI agents working on Operation
Brispec, a corruption probe, would learn of their activities.
   Documents eliminated in the computer purge were ``prepared at
state time using state paper, state equipment,'' a legislative
source said, adding that both parties ``do it and all of that's
paid out of the contingency fund of the Legislature.''
   Under state law, it is illegal for legislative staffers to use
public equipment or money for party work.
   One source, who did not want to be identified, said the
Republican Caucus operated ``a full-time campaign office at
taxpayer expense,'' the newspaper said.
   The Times was given copies of political files that had been put
into state computers. Material included orders to run background
follow-ups on 13 lawmakers.
   The FBI sting has targeted four Los Angeles-area lawmakers and
six others to determine if lawmakers would take bribes in exchange
for legislative support. No arrests have been made.
   One former Republican Caucus staffer said he was ordered the day
after the FBI searched a legislator's office to get rid of
incriminating files.
   The FBI never searched the caucus office, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>House Adopts Resolution Against Rice Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lower house of Japan's parliament today
unanimously adopted a resolution against further opening the
nation's rice market to foreign imports.
   The resolution, passed in a plenary session of the 512-member
Diet, is not binding and is only an ``expression of dietmen,'' said
a parliament official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The action followed a petition filed Wednesday by U.S. rice
producers seeking greater access to Japan's protected rice market.
   The U.S. Rice Millers' Association, in a petition filed with the
office of the U.S. Trade Representative, claimed Japan's virtual
ban on rice imports constitutes unfair trade practices. Under the
U.S. trade act, such practices are subject to penalties. The trade
representative must decide within 45 days whether to proceed with
the case.
   ``Rice production is a major matter of concern for all Japanese
as the basis of maintaining and developing a sound society,'' the
resolution says. It notes rice production affects local
communities, the preservation of land and Japanese culture.
   The Japanese official said parliament's upper house, the House
of Councillors, was expected to adopt a similar resolution
Wednesday.
   Officials have said Japan is willing to discuss rice imports at
the Uruguay meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
the Geneva-based body that sets international trade rules and
provides a forum for settling disputes.
   In Japan, the government controls rice distribution by
purchasing much of the grain directly from farmers at fixed prices
and selling it to retailers at lower prices. But Japanese consumers
still pay seven to eight times more for rice than do Americans,
according to U.S. industry officials.

   Midnight jogs in the nude around a high
school track apparently were just a warm-up for a man police
believe committed pre-dawn burglaries in his birthday suit.
   Late-night joggers reported seeing a nude man running at the
Campbell High School track about six weeks ago.
   A few weeks later, police said, early morning commuters on
Village Parkway spotted a man fitting the description of the jogger
wearing only his socks and tennis shoes.
   Lt. Edwin Clack Jr. said police began to suspect a relationship
between the incidents when they received a call about a nude
burglar.
   The man broke into a house in this Atlanta suburb early Saturday
but fled when he confronted by the woman who lived there.
   Police believe the same man was involved in all three incidents.
   ``We're anxious to get him off the street,'' Clack said.

<HEAD>Atlanta To Fine Abortion Protest Leaders Who Break Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials, exasperated by almost daily
anti-abortion demonstrations this summer, have passed a bill to
fine protest leaders who trespass or harass patients at abortion
clinics.
   The City Council voted 12-5 Monday for a measure which asks the
city attorney's office to seek court injunctions against leaders of
Operation Rescue, the group that organized the protests.
   The measure does not interfere with the right to picket and to
free speech, council members said.
   Barbara Magera, a staff member of Operation Rescue in Atlanta,
said the decision would not deter the group, which has taken
September off from the protests but vows to return in October.
   She said similar actions were taken in New York and in
Philadelphia, but protests continued.
   The protests that began during the Democratic National
Convention in July clogged the city's legal system, putting more
than 700 people in jail and costing Atlanta more than $500,000,
said Barbara Asher, chairwoman of the city's Public Safety
Commission and sponsor of Monday's resolution.
   ``They are trying to grind the machinery of this city to a
halt,'' Mrs. Asher said.
   Councilman Hosea Williams said he planned to challenge the
constitutionality of the decision in court. The civil rights leader
compared it to laws passed in the past to deny rights to blacks.
   ``This is a very dangerous bill,'' Williams said. ``It's going
to put Atlanta in such a bad light.''
   However, Councilman Jabari Simama said the bill ``will not deny
this group's rights to exercise its First Amendment rights.''

   After-tax corporate profits jumped 8.9 percent
in the second quarter of this year, the best performance in nearly
five years, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said after-tax profits rose to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $162.7 billion, up $13.3 billion
from the first quarter.
   It was the biggest jump since an 11.4 percent increase in the
third quarter of 1983.
   However, today's report for the April-June quarter represents a
downward revision from an estimate last month when the department
said profits after tax soared 11.5 percent.
   Profits were up 2.5 percent in the first quarter.
   Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds
companies have for investment, rose 1.4 percent in the second
quarter following a 0.9 percent increase in the January-March
period.
   Dividend payments to stockholders rose 1.8 percent in the second
quarter to an annual rate of $103.1 billion.

   Thousands of people rallied in Armenia today,
closing businesses and schools in a protest that followed a bloody
clash between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in a disputed region of
the southern Soviet Union.
   Meanwhile, one of the 25 people who the official news agency
Tass said had been hurt in Sunday's shootout died the next day, an
editor of a Tass affiliate said.
   The clash occurred in the village of Khadzhaly in the
predominantly Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh enclave of Azerbaijan, Tass
said.
   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan, in a telephone interview from
the Amenian capital of Yerevan, said Armenians did not use weapons.
He did not elaborate. An editor for Armenpress, the Tass affiliate
in Armenia, said Monday that Azerbaijanis were the only ones
carrying firearms.
   The executive committee of Armenia's parliament was to meet
today or Wednesday to discuss protesters' long-standing demands to
annex Nagorno-Karabakh, Popoyan said.
   Armenians began campaigning in February for control of
Nagorno-Karabakh near the Turkish-Iranian border. Armenians make up
76 percent of the region's 162,000 people and have strong
historical links to the enclave, which was made part of Azerbaijan
in 1923.
   Several thousand people gathered today in Yerevan's downtown
square, an Interior Ministry officer said, and were ``just standing
around conversing.''
   Police stepped up patrols in this city, said a duty officer at
Armenia's Interior Ministry, speaking by telephone from Yerevan.
   Popoyan, a 46-year-old former political prisoner, said 1 million
Armenians attended a rally in Yerevan Monday night and demanded an
emergency meeting of the republic's parliament, the Supreme Soviet.
   A deputy director of Armenpress, who spoke on condition his name
not be used, said more than 250,000 people were at the
demonstration.
   The protesters want the Supreme Soviet to demand the annexation
of Nagorno-Karabakh, Popoyan said. The body has made such a
decision, but was rebuffed by the country's Supreme Soviet in
Moscow.
   Armenia's president, Grant Voskanyan, told Monday's rally that
parliament's executive committee would meet today or Wednesday to
decide whether to call a full Supreme Soviet session, according to
Popoyan.
   At Monday night's rally, demonstrators decided to continue a
general strike that began Friday, according to Popoyan, and many
businesses and schools were closed in Yerevan today.
   He said the demonstrators decided to continue the walkout until
the Supreme Soviet acts on their demands.
   A strike also has been reported in the main city of
Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert.
   An Armenpress editor said Sunday's clash was touched off by
reports that Azerbaijanis had stoned a busload of Armenians the
previous day in the village.
   A 61-year-old carpenter injured in the shootout died Monday in a
hospital, an editor of a Tass affiliate in Azerbaijan said by
telephone from the republic's capital, Baku. Both editors spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In Baku, Azerbaijani Communist Party chief Abdul-Rahman Vezirov
told local officials today the clashes were part of ``anti-social
activities'' among some of the populace, Tass reported. He said
required stricter controls were needed to ensure order, the agency
reported.
   Armenians are predominantly Christian; most Azerbaijanis are
Shiite Moslem. Armenians also differ linguistically and culturally
from ethnic Azerbaijanis.
   At least 32 people, 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis, were
killed in three days of rioting that began Feb. 28 in the
Azerbaijani port of Sumgait.
   In July, central authorities in Moscow rejected the annexation
demand and instead approved a plan to redress Armenians' grievances
of poor housing, hospitals, schools and Armenian cultural
facilities in Nagorno-Karabakh.

   Israel's leaders said their launching of a test
satellite reportedly packed with U.S.-made surveillance equipment
would not spur the arms race in the Middle East.
   Arab officials and newspapers called Monday's launch a ``spy
satellite'' and said the craft would be used for military purposes
and would threaten the entire Arab world.
   The launching of a three-stage rocket carrying the gray
Horizon-1 satellite made Israel only the eighth nation to place a
satellite in space.
   ``There are few countries in the world capable of doing this and
the citizens of Israel can be proud of their country,'' Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israel radio.
   In Washington, Arab League representative Clovis Maksoud voiced
concern over the launch, saying the satellite gave Israel ``a
serious strategic leverage'' since the country already had the
capability to fire long-range missiles.
   The Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in London, described the
craft as a ``spy satellite (and part of a) psychological war being
carried out by the Zionists against the Arab nation.''
   Tishrin, a Syrian government newspaper whose editorials
generally reflect official stands, also called the craft a ``spy
satellite'' and predicted it would be used for military purposes.
   ``The U.S. commitment to expand Israel's military power is a
permanent source of danger and tension in the Middle East,''
Tishrin added.
   Syria is Israel's main enemy in the Middle East.
   In Egypt and Saudi Arabia, radio stations reported the launching
with no comment. The Soviet media ignored the story, and Israel
radio quoted a Jordanian official as saying the satellite
apparently had military uses.
   Both Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres dismissed fears
that the satellite would spur an arms race with Arab countries.
   ``The Arabs bought missiles and produce missiles and will do
anything they can anyway,'' Peres said on the radio.
   Yuval Neeman, head of Israel's space agency, said the satellite
would remain in orbit for about a month before disintegrating.
   Development of the Horizon-1 was the result of more than 20
years of Israeli space research and was part of the country's
effort to become independent in the defense field.
   Until now, Israel has relied on the United States to provide
satellite pictures, but some officials have complained the U.S. was
stingy in supplying intelligence information.
   In March 1987, former U.S. Navy analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard was
sentenced to life in prison for selling Israel hundreds of U.S.
military documents.
   Israeli media have quoted U.S. and Israeli sources as saying the
documents Pollard delivered included satellite pictures of Iraqi
and Syrian weapons and storage facilities.
   ``If you are fed from the crumbs of others according to their
whims, this is very inconvenient and very difficult,'' said Meir
Amit, a former head of Israel's Mossad secret service and now chief
of the General Satellite Corp., a communications satellites
producer.
   A possible source of concern to Israel is the news that Saudi
Arabia is deploying Chinese-built CSS-2 missiles about 285 miles
south of Riyad.
   Satellite photographs displayed by Space Media Network, a
private Swedish firm, showed the Saudis were expanding an airstrip
and a military complex to accommodate the new weapons.
   The Israeli satellite weighs about 340 pounds and is believed to
be carrying a 6.6-pound payload for surveillance usage, apparently
for monitoring activity in Arab countries, according to a spokesman
for Jane's Defense Weekly, the London-based defense magazine.
   Tony Banks, a Jane's reporter with close ties to Israeli
military sources, said Israel was not believed to have the
capability of installing sophisticated surveillance equipment in a
satellite.
   ``U.S. optical equipment is assumed to have been used in the
payload,'' Banks told The Associated Press in London.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the United
States was not involved with the Israeli program.
   Pentagon officials said they were unsure exactly what was in the
satellite's payload. One source said on condition of anonymity that
``we're leaning toward more of an experimental communications
package as opposed to a true spy satellite.''
   Foreign reports said earlier that the satellite was a test craft
that would precede the launching of a spy satellite. Neeman said a
second satellite was already under development and would be used to
carry out scientific tests.

<HEAD>Man Who Put Up Famed Roadside Dinosaurs Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Claude K. Bell, whose dinosaur creations
became a landmark to millions of Southern California desert
travelers, has died at 91, but his family vowed that his fanciful
``dinosaur garden'' would live on.
   Bell died Monday of pneumonia at Humana Hospital in Anaheim.
   Bell and his dinosaurs have been featured in People magazine,
the film ``Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'' and a book titled ``The
Well-Built Elephant and Other Roadside Attractions _ A Tribute to
American Eccentricity.''
   The retired amusement park sculptor spent more than two decades
and $300,000 creating the giant creatures _ a 150-ton, concrete
brontosaurus named Dinney and a 100-ton tyrannosaurus named Rex _
on an otherwise desolate stretch of Interstate 10 near Palm Springs.
   The towering dinosaurs can be seen for miles by travelers
approaching the tiny community of Cabazon on the desert route
between Phoenix and Los Angeles.
   ``The dinosaurs aren't dead and they never will be,'' Bell's
daughter, Wendy Murphy of Costa Mesa, said. ``He wanted to build a
monument that would withstand the sands of time, and he has done
that.''
   Bell, a retired sculptor for Orange County's popular Knott's
Berry Farm amusement park, was in his mid-60s when he first began
building the steel-framed, 150-foot-long brontosaurus on 60 acres
of desert land he owned at Cabazon.
   It was meant to be the first of several figures in his Dinosaur
Garden theme park. Plans to add a giant mastodon and a sabre-tooth
tiger are on the drawing board.
   The park, which includes a museum and gift shop, is run by
Bell's son-in-law, Denny Rowing.
   Bell is survived by his wife, Anna Marie, a son, five daughters,
14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

   Three defendants in the Howard Beach racial
assault case have been sentenced to weekends in jail for four
months.
   William Bollander, 19, Thomas Farino, 18, and James Povinelli,
18, also were placed on three years' probation and ordered to serve
200 hours of community service at their sentencing Monday.
   They were convicted of participating in a riotous assault in
late 1986 by a dozen white youths on three black men in the Howard
Beach section of Queens. The charges carried potential sentences of
up to a year in jail.
   The attack led to the death of one of the black men, Michael
Griffith, 23, who was struck by a car while fleeing the white mob.
Three white youths were convicted of manslaughter in the case last
December.
   Three other youths have been acquitted of all charges in the
case; two others were placed on probation after pleading guilty to
riot charges. The twelfth, Robert Riley, 19, has agreed to plead
guilty to manslaughter.

   Edward Smith could spend at least five years
in jail, separated from the family he tried to protect, for fatally
shooting a youth who was among neighborhood troublemakers pelting
his house with snowballs.
   Youths had harassed the family repeatedly for six years. They
had broken into a basement radio repair shop and scrawled graffiti
on the walls.
   Smith finally cracked when a snowball smashed a window and cut
one of his daughters on Jan. 30, 1987.
   Later that night, more snowballs hit the house and Smith went
out on his porch with a .357-caliber Magnum revolver. He fired two
shots toward a group of boys. He intended them as warnings, he told
police.
   But one shot hit Peter McGettigan in the spine and exited
through his chest. The 16-year-old high school sophomore died,
leaving his parents, six siblings, Smith's family and their
neighborhood in agony.
   Smith, 49, was convicted Monday of third-degree murder and
sentenced to five to 10 years in prison.
   Common Pleas Judge Eugene H. Clarke Jr. also found Smith guilty
of weapons possession and reckless endangerment in the non-jury
trial.
   Smith received the mandatory minimum term for third-degree
murder while using a gun. He could receive up to seven more years
when sentenced on the other charges Nov. 29.
   But one positive outcome of all of the anguish was the formation
of a neighborhood group, Citizens for Community Aid, which Edward
Williams, a crime prevention officer with the Philadelphia Police
Department, said has helped defuse tension.
   Williams said the circumstances that pushed Smith over the brink
were common in the city's Olney section, a blue-collar neighborhood.
   ``The kids actually controlled their community in the sense that
the adults feared coming out of their houses because of
harassment,'' Williams said.
   But with the new community organization, he added: ``Some of the
kids that I saw that were responsible for some of the tensions have
changed completely. We probably saved a few lives. The tension at
that time was such that it could have exploded again.''
   Drugs, alcohol and the lack of places for teen-agers to gather
were major problems, he said.
   Myra Fesi, the group's executive director, said it has helped
six to eight youths enter education programs or obtain drug or
alcohol treatment through the juvenile justice system.
   ``The community has to take ownership of the community,'' Mrs.
Fesi said. ``You can't have cops in your community 24 hours a day.
We've got to do it, the people who live there.''
   After Monday's verdict, Smith's attorney, Stanley W. Bluestine,
said, ``It's just a very tragic situation all the way around.''
   ``I feel bad for the family,'' said Smith, who remained free on
$15,000 bail. ``I feel bad for the boy. I feel bad for the sorrow
and grief I've brought my own family.''
   The dead youth's mother, Julie McGettigan, said: ``My son is
dead 18 months. Mr. Smith's family has been through God knows what
in those 18 months and they have more to go through. It's been
lousy all the way through, and I'm sorry it happened.''
   Her husband, William, added: ``The only person I don't feel
sorry for is Smith.''
   The group formed in the wake of the killing has suffered
setbacks in its efforts to raise money for a community center, Mrs.
Fesi said.
   A woman who took a public role in forming the group moved after
she was harassed. ``We could never prove who did it,'' Mrs. Fesi
said. ``They even threatened to bomb her house, so she had to
move.''
   Bluestine said he understood tensions remained, and his client
also moved after the shooting.
   ``It's a bad situation up there, and from my understanding it's
still continuing,'' he said. ``There's still a lot of problems with
teen-age boys.''

<HEAD>Army Closes Territories For Yom Kippur, Arab Boy Shot</HEAD>

   The army sealed off the occupied lands today to
prevent violence during the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday. Earlier,
witnesses said an 11-year-old Arab boy was shot in the thigh by an
Israeli truck driver who was firing at stone throwers.
   The army erected roadblocks throughout the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip to stop Palestinians from entering Israel during Yom
Kippur, the day of atonement that was to begin shortly before
sundown today.
   In the biblical city of Bethlehem, four miles south of
Jerusalem, drivers with blue West Bank plates were turned away at
an army checkpoint. A pink sign in Arabic read: ``Dear driver, the
road to Jerusalem is closed starting at 3 p.m.''
   The army seals off the occupied lands for all Jewish High
Holidays to lessen the possibility of Palestinian attacks inside
Israel. In the 9-month-old uprising in the occupied lands, 269
Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed.
   In the Gaza Strip today, the driver of an Israeli gasoline truck
opened fire after his vehicle was stoned, said Naher Yussef
Hassilek, who was shot in the right thigh.
   ``I was passing near the gasoline pump on my way home when this
man shot me,'' Hassilek, a newspaper delivery boy, told an Arab
reporter at Ahli Arab Hospital.
   Arab witnesses said the same driver had opened fire in the area
in the past, and that he shot and wounded an Arab youth earlier
this year.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   Also today, Israeli authorities complied with a Supreme Court
order and disclosed that a 23-year-old Palestinian who died in 1987
during interrogation by secret service agents had suffocated.
Israeli officials said earlier that Awad Hamdan died of a heart
attack.
   Felicia Langer, an attorney for Hamdan's family, said an autopsy
also showed signs of an inflammation in his heart. She said she
would petition the high court for disclosure of the exact
circumstances of Hamdan's death.
   Hamdan, a resident of the West Bank city of Tulkarem, died July
21, 1987, two days after his arrest. Relatives alleged he was
tortured to death by Shin Bet secret service agents.
   Last year, Attorney General Yosef Harish ordered a police
investigation into Hamdan's death. Three Shin Bet agents were
suspended for lying about the circumstances of the death.
   One agent was subsequently ordered to stand trial behind closed
doors on charges he caused Hamdan's death by negligence.
   Also today, five Americans on a Palestinian-sponsored tour
protested the seizure of their passports by the army in the West
Bank. Army officials said the five incited an anti-Israeli
demonstration in Ramallah and would have to submit to questioning
by police to get their passports back.
   U.S. consulate officials said they brought up the incident,
which occurred Sunday, with the government. ``Our position is that
American passports are U.S. government property and should not be
taken,'' consulate spokesman David Good said.
   The Americans, touring the occupied lands at the invitation of
the San Francisco-based Palestine Solidarity Committee, claimed
they were harassed, saying the passports were confiscated while
troops were breaking up a demonstration by Palestinian women by
using tear gas and rubber bullets.
   ``We watched, shocked and horrified,'' the group said in a
statement. ``Before we knew it our passports were being demanded.
No reason was given, nor was it explained how or when they would be
returned.''
   The five are Dick Reilly, 36, a health care worker from Chicago;
Bill Doares, 33, a trade unionist from New York City; Joyce Wilcox,
43, a legal worker in the New York City law office of William
Kunstler; Judy Janda, 49, a photographer from New York City; and
Todd May, 33, a student from Pittsburgh.

<HEAD>LA's Worst Slumlord Vanishes After Being Freed on Bail in New
Jersey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man authorities call Los Angeles' worst
slumlord is believed to be a fugitive again after being
inadvertently released from custody, officials said.
   Vijaynard Sharma, 41, of Inglewood, posted $20,000 bail in a New
Jersey court and was freed Friday, said Ted Goldstein, a spokesman
for the Los Angeles city attorney's office.
   Sharma, captured last week by FBI agents, had disappeared in
January while on bail pending sentencing in Los Angeles for more
than 100 housing-code violations.
   He failed to appear in a New Jersey courtroom Monday for an
extradition hearing.
   The judge who released him on $20,000 bail apparently was
unaware that Sharma had outstanding warrants with bails totaling
$2.65 million, officials said. The name of the judge was not
immediately known, said Harriet Sherman, assistant chief of
extradition in the Los Angeles district attorney's office.
   Deputy City Attorney Stephanie Sautner said she ``was pretty
surprised and a little angry'' when told of Sharma's disappearance.
   The FBI had been holding Sharma on a no-bail federal fugitive
warrant. However, ``once he was turned over to local authorities,
our warrant no longer applies,'' said John Kundts, special agent in
the FBI's Philadelphia office.
   ``We didn't feel he could be released on any bail,'' said Los
Angeles City Attorney James K. Hahn. ``That was our understanding.
It turns out that that was erroneous.''
   Sharma, a native of Fiji who once owned 18 tenement properties,
was convicted last year of 112 misdemeanor housing-code violations
involving five rat-infested residential buildings. City officials
said it was the biggest slumlord case they had ever prosecuted.
   He also is a defendant in eight pending slumlord cases.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bill Clements, touring this city
where Hurricane Gilbert caused an estimated $35 million in damage,
says he expects to get federal emergency assistance for the area.
   At least 41 tornadoes struck Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane
Gilbert, leaving hundreds of people without homes. Two San Antonio
residents were among the more than 200 killed overall as the storm
swept through the Caribbean and Mexico.
   Throughout south Texas, 981 homes were damaged or destroyed by
the hurricane and tornadoes, said Red Cross spokesman Frank
Stipkala in San Antonio.
   On Saturday, Clements asked the federal government to declare
Brownsville a disaster area. He toured the Rio Grande Valley and
San Antonio on Monday.
   ``This is far worse than anything in Brownsville,'' Clements
said. ``There is no place anywhere (in Texas) that suffered this
kind of damage.''
   The declaration would pave the way for assistance from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and would enable businesses to
receive low-interest loans from the Small Business Adminstration.
   It also could ultimately help homeless residents with temporary
housing for a certain period, officials said.
   Mayor Henry Cisneros and Bexar County Judge Tom Vickers escorted
Clements on the tour.
   Among the stops was an apartment complex where a twister early
Saturday destroyed 120 units, damaged 260 units and left 300 people
homeless.
   ``It's amazing to me that no one was killed,'' Clements said as
he climbed over bricks on a tour of The Lodge Apartments.
   Vickers said city and county officials were assessing the damage
and would try to get a report to Clements later this week. The
governor said he would await that information before making the
disaster request.
   ``The approval and certification of it being declared a disaster
area can happen very quickly, but the individual payment will be
slower than that,'' Clements said. ``But the first step is to have
it declared an emergency, and I don't think we'll have any problem
doing that.''
   In contrast to the hard-hit San Antonio area, the Rio Grande
Valley may not need federal aid, officials there said.
   Harlingen Mayor Bill Card said his city suffered up to $800,000
in damage to mostly private property and the federal assistance
might not be needed.
   Brownsville Mayor Ygnacio Garza said the city spent thousands of
dollars preparing and cleaning up after the storm.
   ``Whether it will meet the criteria for a true disaster, I don't
think so, or I'm not sure and really we're not too upset about
that,'' Garza said.
   South Padre Island City Manager Eduardo Campriano said the storm
caused about $100,000 in damage to city property, mostly road
damage.
   In Corpus Christi, Nueces County Commissioner J.P. Luby said two
beach parks suffered about $100,000 damage and he was considering a
request for federal aid.
   Most of the damage in Texas was in San Antonio, where residences
at least $5 million in damage. A tornado that cut through Kelly Air
Force Base caused $28 million in damage to 12 buildings and
aircraft parts. Another tornado destroyed the air-conditioning
system at the Veterans Administration Hospital, causing $2 million
in damage.

   Presidential rivals Michael Dukakis and George
Bush are trying to impress a national television audience of
potential voters this month between the dives and somersaults of
the Summer Olympic Games.
   Both candidates are running advertisements during prime-time
Olympic coverage on NBC. The network is getting as much as $330,000
for 30 seconds of advertising time.
   A new Bush spot is called ``The Mission,'' featuring an excerpt
from the vice president's acceptance speech last month at the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans.
   ``I am a man who sees life in terms of missions. Missions
defined and missions completed,'' Bush says in the excerpt. ``I
will keep America moving forward, always forward. ... This is my
mission. I will complete it.''
   Bush's ad director, Sig Rogich, said the 30-second spot was
scheduled for a ``short run'' but other ads, including two
attacking Dukakis on his environmental and crime-fighting records,
would continue during the Olympics in various parts of the country.
   For his part, Dukakis was airing several Olympics spots in
battleground states such as California and Texas. They depict the
Democratic nominee as a responsible leader, an education advocate
and an anti-crime governor of Massachusetts.
   The education spot, promising an affordable college education to
anyone who wants one, dates from the Iowa primary and was added
Tuesday night, said spokeswoman Lorraine Voles. The other two ads
are new and first aired last week. She said another new spot may be
added by week's end.
   Rogich said Olympics viewers may start seeing ads tying Dukakis
to the Carter presidency, which Republicans portray as a failure.
The spots already have been produced.
   ``You could see some comparative commercials reflecting on the
Carter years, the things that he did, the same outline for the
future that comes from Michael Dukakis,'' Rogich said.

   A major investors' service has reinstated
Yonkers' bond rating, but efforts failed to bring together the two
sides in the housing desegregation case that led to the city's
financial problems.
   Moody's Investors Service announced Monday it had reinstated the
Baa rating on obligation bonds. The highest rating is Aaa.
   The rating was based on the security derived from the setting
aside of property taxes, with the state comptroller as fiscal
agent, for the purpose of meeting debts, Moody's said. City
officials said $25.9 million was set aside.
   Moody's suspended the bond rating Aug. 4 due to uncertainties
resulting from the daily fines imposed by U.S. District Judge
Leonard Sand after the Yonkers City Council voted to defy his
housing desegregation order.
   Sand's initial fine of $100 had been due to double daily so that
the city would have faced bankruptcy by mid-August. A federal
appeals court later capped the fines at $1 million daily.
   Just as the fines hit the $1 million mark on Sept. 10, the
council voted to pass a zoning ordinance related to the location of
the affordable housing and bring itself into compliance with Sand's
order.
   Yonkers paid $819,100 in fines, $358,041 of which was given to
the city schools.
   Sand had found the city liable for 40 years of segregating
housing and schools in a 1985 landmark decision.
   Meanwhile, Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, who met with leaders of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, one
of the plaintiffs in the original lawsuit, and the Save Yonkers
Federation, a coalition of groups battling the plan, said Monday
that talks between the two sides broke off during the weekend.
   The federation issued a statement reiterating its plan to file a
federal lawsuit concerning the case, without specifying the grounds
or parties.
   In a statement, the coalition said, ``No housing, no sites, no
units are acceptable to us anywhere in the city of Yonkers.''
   The NAACP noted its disappointment at the breakdown of the talks
and said it remained interested in ``bringing peace to the city of
Yonkers.''

<TEXT>
   Zaire's leading opposition figure,
Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, has been freed after nearly six months under
house arrest in internal exile in Isiro in northeastern Zaire.
   Tshisekedi met with President Mobutu Sese Seko in the northern
village of Gbado-Lite on Friday, the same day the Judicial Council
lifted his punishment.
   He had been arrested Jan. 17 on charges of disturbing public
order, then provisionally freed, then was ordered into internal
exile in April after calling for a boycott of partial legislative
elections in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital.
   During the summer, rumors circulated in Zairean exile circles
that Tshisekedi, secretary-general of the Union for Democracy and
Social Progress, might have died in custody.
   On Sept. 4, the head of the Black Caucus in the U.S. Congress,
Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, met with Tshisekedi and said the opposition
leader called on the United States to pressure Mobutu to allow a
multiparty system.
   Every citizen of Zaire, where Mobutu has ruled since 1965, is by
law a member from birth of the Popular Movement of the Revolution,
the only legal political party.

   Author Charles Webb, who wrote ``The
Graduate,'' and his ex-wife Fred have moved out of the home of a
woman who aided the destitute couple because of a ``difference of
opinion on nudism,'' Webb said.
   Marcelle Hall recently invited the couple to stay in her home
after reading that they had little money and no permanent place to
live.
   ``It's not fair to say she threw us out,'' Webb said. ``There
was just a difference of opinion on the nudism. She got really
upset. We didn't realize nudism was such an upsetting thing,
compared to other things that go on in the world.''
   The couple said they moved into the $43-a-night Exit 5 Motel in
Danbury on Saturday night. Destitute by choice after giving away
most of their property, they have only $150 left, they said.
   ``We've got another two nights at the most,'' he said. ``We're
just sort of stunned at this point. She was generous to invite us
into her home. But there were so many things (they disagreed
about). We just feel sort of rocked.''
   Webb is waiting for a call from a lawyer to give him the
go-ahead to write a sequel to ``The Graduate,'' which became a hit
movie that propelled Dustin Hoffman to stardom.
   ``If we get our act together and get this sequel off the ground,
it will be set in the Bethel-Danbury area,'' he said. ``What has
happened to us here will have to be immortalized.''

<HEAD>Israel Launches Vaccination Campaign After Polio Outbreak</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel launched a vaccination campaign today
after the polio virus found in sewage infected at least eight
people with the disease, the Health Ministry announced.
   Six cases of polio were confirmed in the town of Hadera, 28
miles north of Tel Aviv, health officials said. The victims include
a 26-year-old teacher and a 3-month-old boy from the Or Akiva
kibbutz and a teen-age boy from the Ein Shemer collective farm.
   Two other cases were confirmed in the coastal towns of Akko,
about 60 miles north of Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon, about 35 miles
south.
   A Health Ministry statement said about 120,000 people would be
vaccinated in the Hadera area, starting with infants and
pre-schoolers.
   The outbreak caught Israel by surprise. The European division of
the World Health Organization, to which Israel belongs, earlier
this month considered declaring polio wiped out in the country.
   No polio cases were reported in Israel last year and only a
single case was reported in 1986.
   Dr. Avraham Morag of Hadassah Hospital, head of the Health
Ministry's advisory committee on contagious diseases, said that
besides the eight confirmed cases, two more possible cases were
under observation.
   He said health officials also were studying whether to expand
the immunization campaign to other areas.
   Morag said the outbreak was caused by overflowing sewage and the
fact that some people were not vaccinated against polio. He said
``massive amounts'' of the virus were detected in sewage in Or
Akiva and the nearby Arab village of Umm El-Fahm, both in the
Hadera area.
   There have been no polio cases among Arab villagers but they
have been included in the new immunization campaign, Morag said.
   Morag said 95 percent of the Israeli population already has been
immunized against polio.

   A prosecutor who was once told her
short skirts and designer blouses made her look like a ``bimbo''
has been fired for what her boss called professional shortcomings.
   Brenda Taylor lost her $22,000 job as a Broward County assistant
state attorney because of her handling of several drunken driving
cases, her absence or tardiness from court and her failure to
comply with paperwork, her supervisor said Monday.
   ``This is garbage,'' said Ms. Taylor, 25. ``It just shows to
what lengths they will go to get someone.''
   Ms. Taylor contended she was fired because of the complaint she
filed last month with the Broward County Human Relations Commission
against Assistant State Attorney John Countryman, one of her
supervisors.
   In it, she charged him with discriminating against her for the
clothes she wore _ designer styles rather than conservative,
blue-gray suits.
   Countryman's problems with Ms. Taylor were spelled out in five
memos.
   ``I told her that her appearance in court in a short skirt
created the impression that she was a bimbo interested only in
meeting men,'' Countryman, 38, wrote in one memo. ``I stressed that
she was not, but that, to outsiders, appearance was reality.''
   On Aug. 5, supervisors warned Ms. Taylor that her job
performance during a six-month probationary period was
unsatisfactory, and her probation was being extended a month.
   ``Since Aug. 5, nothing of a positive nature has occurred which
would change the opinion of the administrators,'' Ralph Ray, the
office's chief assistant, said in the termination notice.
   Harris Lowenthal, a former assistant state attorney helping to
defend Ms. Taylor, called the job performance criticisms absurd. He
said he doubts any prosecutor has been fired for the same reasons.
   ``I knew it would probably have an effect on my career, but I'm
a good lawyer and I know that my career as a lawyer will go on,''
Ms. Taylor said.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito, the world's longest reigning
monarch, received three blood transfusions today and was in stable
condition after vomiting blood, imperial officials said.
   The Imperial Household Agency and other officials did not
confirm a Kyodo News Service report that the 87-year-old emperor
appeared to be in critical condition this morning despite
night-long treatment by a team of court physicians.
   Kyodo attributed its report to an unidentified person who
attended a Cabinet meeting this morning. It said a pre-dawn
transfusion had not stopped a hemorrhage in his digestive tract.
The imperial agency said no such announcement had been made.
   But in briefings later for Japanese reporters, Iwao Miyao, vice
grand steward of the imperial agency, said doctors had given
Hirohito 1.6 pints of blood during the night, then 0.4 pints more
during the morning and 0.4 pints again during the afternoon.
   An Imperial Household Agency official quoted Miyao as saying in
a briefing at 9:30 p.m. ``I don't think the emperor's condition is
becoming worse, but rather that it is stabilizing.''
   ``The emperor is in stable condition. He has a slight fever and
is receiving intravenous drip,'' said palace spokesman Takenari
Sugawara.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's Cabinet was expected to
approve plans Thursday to place Crown Prince Akihito, 54, in charge
of state matters, Defense Agency head Kichiro Tazawa told reporters.
   The emperor's worsening health caused one former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone to cut short a trip to London and return home.
   At least one morning newspaper, the English-language Japan
Times, printed a single-page extra this afternoon. It bore the
headline ``Ailing Emperor Vomits Some Blood'' and a photo of a
jogger who paused to pray in front of the palace.
   In a briefing to palace reporters this afternoon, Miyao said the
emperor would continue to receive blood and intravenous fluids,
Kyodo said.
   Japanese news media mounted an intense watch on the imperial
palace, in central Tokyo, and reported the arrivals of a stream of
well-wishers, including Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and U.S.
Ambassador Mike Mansfield.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported that Hirohito said ``thank
you'' to his son Akihito and the prince's wife, Crown Princess
Michiko.
   The emperor's death would plunge Japan into official mourning.
Hirohito has occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne since 1926 and,
after renouncing his divinity after World War II, is a figurehead
with the constitutional role of ``symbol of state'' but no power.
   Older Japanese grew up revering him as the divine descendant of
the sun goddess Amaterasu and still honor him highly, while younger
people tend to have less interest in the imperial family.
   Marine biology is the emperor's passion. Indeed, Hirohito is a
widely respected authority on the subject, having written or
co-authored at least 12 books on hydrozoa, or sea animals, his
specialty.
   Late Monday, court physicians were summoned to the palace to
treat the emperor, and early today Miyao told a news conference
that the emperor had vomited blood _ a sign of hemorrhaging _ and
the doctor had administered the first transfusion. The monarch was
conscious through the procedure, Miyao said.
   Hirohito has been frail since an intestinal bypass operation in
September 1987 but he appeared in public for his 87th birthday on
April 29 and on several later occasions. He and Empress Nagako, 85,
spent most of the summer at an imperial villa outside Tokyo,
returning to the capital on Sept. 8.
   Since late summer, he has suffered from colds and fevers and a
news report last week said he had lost 20 pounds of the 130 pounds
he carried before his surgery.

   Michigan's new law barring contracts that pay a
surrogate mother to give up custody rights is constitutional, ruled
a judge who said he still must decide whether a woman can be
reimbursed for the costs of bearing a child for someone else.
   The Michigan attorney general's office and the American Civil
Liberties Union agreed that surrogate arrangements are illegal if a
mother is paid to give up her parental rights. That agreement
enabled Wayne County Circuit Judge John Gillis to rule Monday on
the law's constitutionality without listening to lengthy arguments.
   It's possible Gillis could distinguish between a payment for
giving up parental rights and a payment for the service of bearing
a child. Gillis promised to issue a further ruling within 30 to 60
days.
   The ACLU believes the judge will interpret the law to mean it is
OK to pay a woman for the service of carrying a child, so long as
she wasn't paid to give up custody.
   If the judge agrees, a woman who was artificially inseminated
could keep the money and the baby, and the man whose sperm was used
in the insemination would have to fight for custody of the child.
   After court, Gillis confirmed that is the focus of the decision
still before him.
   National Coalition Against Surrogacy Co-chair Jeremy Rifkin
called Monday's action a major victory because Gillis was the first
judge to rule on the constitutionality of criminal sanctions for
surrogacy.
   ``That is crucial to us because we are in the process of moving
legislation in legislatures across the country,'' he said from
Washington.
   Noel Keane, a Dearborn attorney, is one of the nation's most
prolific surrogacy specialists, claiming responsibility for 245
births, including New Jersey's ``Baby M.''
   Keane expressed confidence the contracts he has been arranging
will be found to be legal.
   He typically makes $10,000 for arranging a birth. Women who
agree to be artificially inseminated and then let the biological
father raise the offspring earn the same amount. The infertile
couple pays the medical costs.
   The new law, which took effect Sept. 1, calls for up to five
years in prison and a $50,000 fine for brokers who make money by
arranging surrogate births. Advertising or ``inducing'' a woman to
bear a child for an infertile couple also became a felony.
   Under the law, women who enter into surrogacy contracts
involving an exchange of money risk misdemeanor penalties of 90
days in jail and a $10,000 fine.
   The law didn't penalize arrangements involving no exchange of
money, but the ACLU argued in a suit on behalf of surrogates and
would-be parents that removing the payment for a woman's services
effectively abolished surrogacy.
   Michigan was the first state to approve criminal penalties for
surrogate parent contracts.
   Kentucky and Louisiana have enacted laws declaring such
contracts illegal but don't impose criminal penalties. Nebraska
doesn't recognize as legal surrogacy contracts, and Indiana has
barred enforcement of surrogate parenting contracts. A Florida law
criminalizing contracts and setting up regulations was passed after
Michigan's, but took effect July 1. Nevada has legalized surrogacy.

   Police were seeking two masked men
believed to be leftist extremists after shots were fired at a
Finance Ministry official near his home today, striking the man's
car but missing him.
   The attack on Hans Tietmeyer, state secretary for the Finance
Ministry, appeared to be an attempt to disrupt preparations for
this month's meeting of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said. Leftists
say industrial nations are not doing enough to help poor countries.
   Police said Tietmeyer was driving to work in the Bonn suburb of
Bad Godesberg when his car was struck by gunfire. Stoltenberg said
the attack occurred about 150 feet from Tietmeyer's house. He said
three shots were fired at the Mercedes.
   ``A shot hit the car, but Tietmeyer was uninjured,'' Bonn police
spokesman Helmut Engelke said.
   Two masked men were seen running from a nearby wooded area,
according to Hans-Juergen Forster, spokesman for the Federal
Prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe.
   Another police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said a shotgun apparently was used in the attack. Police did not
know whether more than one weapon was used.
   Tietmeyer's driver, who was not identified, also escaped injury,
police said.
   They said they were looking for the two men.
   ``This terrible incident appears to be connected with the
upcoming World Bank-International Monetary Fund meeting,''
Stoltenberg told reporters.
   The finance minister said the 57-year-old Tietmeyer had been
involved in planning for the annual World Bank-IMF meeting in West
Berlin Sept 27-29. Tietmeyer is an expert on international finance
and has accompanied Chancellor Helmut Kohl at world economic
meetings.
   On Monday, about 30 masked youths stormed a podium during
international finance talks in Hamburg and beat up West Germany's
IMF executive director, Guenther Grosche, Social Democratic
parliamentarian Ingomar Hauchler and a police officer. The attack
came during a discussion of the IMF.
   As many as 40,000 protesters are expected to be in West Berlin
during the international finance talks to demand that more be done
to help poor nations that are burdened with huge foreign debts.
   West German security officials have warned in recent weeks that
leftist militants among the protesters could cause trouble during
the West Berlin talks.

   The Cook County Board has voted to adopt a policy
allowing county hospital patients to refuse to be treated by people
with the AIDS virus, but the hospital has not developed a way to
make the policy work.
   The county board, which also serves as the hospital board of
directors, voted 15-2 Monday to adopt the policy that would make
the hospital the first in the nation to give patients that right,
officials said.
   ``Our reaction is one of dismay,'' Dr. Lonnie Bristow, a trustee
of the American Medical Association, said last week, after the
board's Health and Hospital Committee approved the policy.
   ``There has been no case in this country of a patient
contracting the AIDS virus from a health-care worker,'' Bristow
said.
   No effective date was announced for the policy, which the
hospital must still determine how to put into practice.
   The policy covers hospital workers who ``routinely provide
direct patient care,'' including doctors and nurses.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's defenses
against disease, leaving a person prey to life-threatening
infections and certain cancers. AIDS has struck more than 72,000
people in this country since 1979 and killed more than 40,000 of
them, according to the national Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   The virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is
believed to be spread through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic
needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during
birth.

   A car bomb exploded today in Christian
east Beirut, killing three people and wounding 25, destroying
dozens of cars and touching off a fire, police and news reports
said.
   Among those wounded was former Information Minister Joseph Skaff
and three of his bodyguards. They were driving through the Dora
district at the time of the 9 a.m. blast, officials said.
   A police spokesman, insisting on anonymity, said Skaff, a
Christian paliamentarian, suffered cuts and burns but that neither
he nor his companions were seriously injured.
   The other casualties were pedestrians, motorists or shopkeepers.
   Voice of Lebanon, the main radio station in east Beirut run by
the Christian Phalange Party, said the bomb-laden automobile was
parked near the Mercedes-Benz car dealership by a young man who
escaped before it blew up.
   The radio station interrupted regular programming to report the
explosion during the morning rush hour. It said 43 cars parked in
the street were destroyed, most of them by a ``huge fire'' that
burned many of the autos before being extinguished an hour later.
   The blast, so powerful it was heard across the Lebanese capital,
was the 13th car bombing in Lebanon this year. By police count, 104
people have been killed and 378 wounded in previous attacks.
   Today's explosion took place an hour before Christian
parliamentary deputies were scheduled to meet in Bkirki north of
Beirut to name a presidential candidate after vetoing a
Syrian-American agreement to nominate deputy Mikhail Daher.
   Skaff, a 50-year-old Greek Catholic, was en route to Bkirki at
the time.
   Daher, a pro-Syrian Maronite Christian, did not attend the
meeting at the seat of the Maronites' patriarch, Nasrallah Sfeir.
   A spokesman for Sfeir said he expected the Christians to name
Raymond Edde as their candidate. Edde, 75, has been living in
self-imposed exile in France since 1976, when he fled Lebanon after
surviving three attempts on his life.
   The conferees met for four hours but postponed a decision until
Wednesday, when another session was scheduled.
   Under the Lebanese constitution, presidential elections must
take place before President Amin Gemayel's six-year term ends Sept.
23.

   Alderman Lawrence Bloom, a longtime independent
who represents the Hyde Park ward that includes the University of
Chicago, has announced his candidacy for mayor.
   Bloom, a three-term alderman who was a close ally of the late
Mayor Harold Washington, said Monday he would bring together a city
left floundering by Washington's death last November.
   ``In the Bloom administration, there will be no forgotten
neighborhoods,'' said the alderman, who had Washington's backing in
an unsuccessful bid in the 1984 Democratic primary to unseat Cook
County State's Attorney Richard M. Daley.
   The election is set for 1989, with a primary in February, but
could be put off until 1991, depending on the outcome of a state
Supreme Court case.
   The only other announced candidate is Alderman Danny Davis, but
expected to join the race are Mayor Eugene Sawyer, Alderman Timothy
Evans and Alderman Edward Burke. Evans, Davis and Bloom often vote
together in City Council, while Burke and Sawyer _ elected by the
council after Washington's death _ are allied on many issues.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS five grafs to clarify that Soviets have been able to
buy some alcoholic beverages in food stores throughout anti-alcohol
campaign, details. Picks up graf 4 pvs, `The policy ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wine, beer, champagne and cognac will be available
in Soviet food stores, but the Kremlin plans to continue sharp
restrictions on the sale of vodka, the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda said.
   The daily said Monday that the Cabinet, known as the Council of
Ministers, reviewed Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 1985
anti-alcohol campaign that raised prices and the drinking age while
cutting hours of liquor stores and the production of alcoholic
beverages.
   ``Dry wines, champagne, cognac and beer ... are permitted to be
sold in food stores and it was proposed to put an end to queues
that humiliate human dignity,'' the Pravda report said.
   Muscovites say they have been able to buy champagne, expensive
cognac and sometimes beer in some food stores throughout
Gorbachev's campaign to restrict alcohol sales.
   It was not immediately clear whether the Council of Ministers
intended to increase supplies to food stores, or stock them with
cheaper, more popular beverages to end the long lines of Soviets at
liquor stores.
   The policy governing the sale of distilled liquors, such as
vodka, has not changed. Soviets who want to buy vodka still must
shop at special stores only between 2-8 p.m. Monday through
Saturday and buy only two bottles a person.
   Shortly before New Year's this year, a wave of letters and press
commentaries critical of long lines for wine or champagne at liquor
stores was published in the Soviet media.
   In response, the Kremlin permitted sales of non-distilled
alcohol on grocery store shelves for the holiday period, but only
for one week.
   Pravda said Monday that the measures Gorbachev introduced more
than three years ago, including cutting production of strong drink
in half, reducing sales hours and closing some shops, had waged a
successful war on drunkenness.
   ``It was noted at the (Council of Ministers) meeting that
appreciable success was received in liquidating alcoholism and hard
drinking after adoption of the decree in 1985,'' the newspaper
said. ``Drinking has been stopped at factories and plants as well
as at other public places.''
   Pravda said the anti-drink campaign had helped reduce crime and
helped citizens ``to live and breathe more freely.''
   But articles in Soviet papers have called the campaign excessive
and said it mostly hurt the occasional drinker who wanted a bottle
of champagne or wine for a holiday or family celebration.
   The crackdown also led to a surge in moonshining.
   The labor newspaper Trud reported in May that moonshiners were
outproducing legal liquor manufacturers, and some articles have
attributed recurring sugar shortages to moonshiners who use it in
the distilling process.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura disclosed earlier this year
that the anti-drinking campaign had shut down 70 percent of the
50,000 Moscow liquor shops that had been operating since May 1985.
   Last November, Pravda reported there were 4.5 million diagnosed
alcoholics in the country and millions of others who have avoided
detection or treatment.

<HEAD>Court Order To Clean Up Air Could Mean Lifestyle Changes,
Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court order that takes the first step
toward cleaning up Southern California's polluted air could lead to
stronger auto emission controls and a reduction in the number of
freeway commuters, officials said.
   U.S. District Judge Harry Hupp on Monday ordered the
Environmental Protection Agency to draft a plan to reduce pollution
in the South Coast Air Basin, which includes Los Angeles, Orange,
Riverside and San Bernardino counties.
   Hupp's order was expected after the EPA acknowledged in July
that it is required by federal law to take over smog control
enforcement in the basin after the local air quality management
district missed a deadline for meeting ozone and carbon monoxide
health standards. The order doesn't set a deadline for EPA's plan.
   EPA officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Los
Angeles Times they hope Congress will extend compliance deadlines
before the EPA is forced to impose stringent restrictions on the
area.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas said the agency is legally
required to draft a plan that would reduce smog by 1993.
   That five-year deadline would require curtailing rush-hour
traffic.
   ``I think 20 years is by far the more realistic time frame, and
even with that, it will require tremendous change on everybody's
part, and even new technology to accomplish it,'' Thomas said.
   But he said, ``the law won't let me go beyond five years.''
   Mark Abramowitz, a spokesman for the Coalition for Clean Air,
said the organization, along with the Sierra Club, believes that a
five-year deadline would force such strict control measures that
the public would oppose it. He said the environmental groups hoped
for a 12- to 15-year plan.
   The basin has some of the worst air in the country despite auto
emissions standards and controls over industrial polluters.

   The Boy Scouts of America is putting its members
to work in the fight against hunger, hoping they will collect 100
million cans of food for the needy in a door-to-door campaign this
fall.
   ``Hunger is a problem we can do something about by working
together,'' Ben H. Love, chief executive of the Scouts, said Monday
at a Chicago news conference.
   The ``Scouting for Food'' program calls for Cub Scouts, Boy
Scouts and Explorers to go to homes in the next two months and drop
off bags. A few weeks later, the bags will be collected and the
cans of food distributed to various relief agencies.
   The United Way and the National Guard will be aiding the effort.
Many others, like food chains, civic and religious groups, fire
departments and various local agencies, also are cooperating.
   ``It is an example of scouting's long-standing commitment to
community service,'' Love said.
   Frank J. Morgan, president and chief operating officer of
Chicago-based Quaker Oats Co., is the volunteer chairman of the
food drive.
   Dr. J. Larry Brown, head of a hunger task force at Harvard
University, said much of the hunger problem in the United States
often goes unnoticed.
   ``It's not like the Third World where we can look at swollen
bellies,'' Brown said.
   The scouts hope to collect the food by Nov. 19 and announce
results of the drive on Dec. 16.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis proposed today that the
federal government require employers to provide minimum health
insurance coverage for all American workers, which his campaign
said would provide benefits to about 22 million people who have
none.
   Underscoring his emphasis on health issues, the Massachusetts
governor campaigned at a Houston medical center with visits to two
clinics. He was to present his health insurance plan in a speech at
Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, Ky.
   At Hermann Hospital, part of the Texas Medical Center, the
Democrtic nominee sat with a dozen selected patients and family
members in the waiting room of a cancer ward and asked each in turn
about medical costs and health insurance problems.
   ``I think it's time we did something,'' he said. ``It's getting
worse ...''
   ``If all goes well on the 8th of November, Sen. (Lloyd) Bentsen
and I are going to do something about it,'' Dukakis said. ``Spread
the word.''
   His campaign issued a statement saying that as president,
Dukakis would propose legislation that would require all employers
to provide basic health plans for their workers, with special
provisions for small and start-up businesses.
   Dukakis' health adviser, Dr. David Blumenthal of Boston, said
the campaign had no estimate of what the proposal would cost
employers. The statement said it would not cost the federal
government anything.
   The statement also said that if elected, Dukakis would appoint a
task force to report by March 30, 1989, on follow-up legislation
that would guarantee universal health coverage, thus extending
benefits to every American, working or not.
   Blumenthal said 37 million to 40 million Americans are without
health insurance. He said the initial Dukakis plan would guarantee
coverage to about two-thirds of them by requiring that employers
provide insurance or risk civil penalties. The other one-third
would be covered under the second-step universal health plan.
   The follow-up plan for all Americans presumably would require
some federal financing, but the campaign was silent on that
question. Details apparently would be worked out by the task force.
   Blumenthal said the proposed national plan was patterned after a
Massachusetts system not yet six months old, which is to provide
health care coverage to every state resident by 1992.
   The prospective cost of that system is a topic of debate.
Dukakis estimated net cost at about $623 million through 1992; some
critics say it would be twice that much.
   The stress on health care was part of the campaign effort to
take control of the political agenda, and choose topics instead of
replying to Republican political offensives.
   Dukakis punctuated it with a daylong offensive against his
Republican rival.
   Campaigning with his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas,
Dukakis said he wondered what might have happened during the past
eight years if President Reagan had chosen a vice president
``strong enough to think for himself and speak up for himself.''
   Dukakis said he chose Bentsen because he didn't want a yes man
but a strong man who would `speak his mind and make a difference.`
   ``We haven't had that kind of vice president'' in Bush, Dukakis
said.
   Campaigning in Little Rock Monday, Dukakis told an invited
audience of about 800 that Bush's proposal for a reduction in the
capital gains tax is ``a warmed-over call to selfishness.''
   He said Bush's vision is of ``a complacent America, an America
that wants to look backward.''
   Dukakis added that even Republicans realize four more years of
Reaganomics would be bad, ``and four more years of Reaganomics
without Reagan would be a disaster.''
   At a Houston forum sponsored by representatives of the depressed
oil industry, Dukakis accused Bush of changing his tune on energy
policy, promising to stop offshore drilling when in California,
supporting it when in Texas.
   ``George Bush is like a coin,'' Dukakis told an audience of
about 1,000 at the Houston Club Monday night. ``They just flip him.
Sometimes he lands on his head. Sometimes he lands on his tail.''
   Dukakis and Bentsen appeared together at a closed-door
fund-raising dinner at a Houston hotel.
   At the energy forum, where Bush was jeered for declining to
appear, Dukakis promised to pay premiums or provide tax incentives
to purchase domestic oil and promote oil and gas drilling. He did
not estimate the cost or say how it would be financed.
   He also said that as president he would convene a ``bipartisan
energy summit'' with Bentsen as chairman, to design a comprehensive
energy policy.

   Vandals carved racial slurs on doors and
splashed paint on an entry-way floor at the home of Mississippi's
first black congressman since Reconstruction, who is running for a
second term this fall.
   An upset Mike Espy took time off from his 2nd District campaign
today to repair the damage to his home in this town a few miles
north of Jackson.
   ``Sure, it makes you angry,'' he said. ``We've come a long way
in Mississippi, but cases like this remind you how far we've got to
go.''
   Espy, a Democrat who faces Republican Jack Coleman in November,
said his major concern was for his family.
   ``I'm the congressman. I have the record and I have my
performance to defend and I can defend it,'' Espy said. ``I'm the
congressman, not my wife, my brother or my children.''
   Espy said his wife discovered the vandalism when she returned
home with her children late Monday.
   ``My son is 5 and my daughter is 8 and I had to explain to them
the history of race relations in Mississippi,'' he said. ``They had
carved the word `Nigger' on two doors and I had to tell my children
what that meant and why somebody would do that. It was not an easy
thing to do.
   ``If someone wants to come after me, let them come, but I want
them to leave my family alone.''
   The congressman said the racial slurs were carved on doors in
the covered entry-way leading into the house and a garage area. He
said the letters were cut into the doors near the top, along with
``U.S. Con'' _ apparently referring to congressman.
   He said plants in the entry-way had been uprooted and paint
dashed on the floor and on some of the plants.
   Espy said both doors were locked when his family arrived, and
there apparently had been no attempt get inside. He said police
were called and were investigating.
   Madison Police Chief Jimmy Dukes said his officers had filed a
report on the vandalism and an investigation was under way.
   Ed Cole, chairman of the state Democratic Party, called for a
full investigation of the incident.
   ``I hope this campaign does not degenerate into that level of
activity,'' he said. ``I think Mississippi has gone a long way in
erasing a negative image it has had outside the state.
   ``Mike Espy has been a good congressman for this state and he
has done a whole lot to improve Mississippi's image,'' he said. ``I
hope we are not going to allow a few narrow-minded people to take
us back to a period we have gone through.''
   Espy said he had received threatening calls in the past, ``but
you always expect those. There has not been an increase in those
calls, and this is the first time something like this has
happened.''
   ``I think most Mississippians would be upset to hear something
like this has happened,'' he added, ``but we all realize there are
still some ignorant people running around. We also realize that in
public life, we are prone to attack.''

   Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen, campaigning in East Texas oil country, said today
that on energy policy the Reagan administration ``has drilled a
real dry hole.''
   Bentsen reiterated presidential nominee Michael Dukakis' promise
to take government action to revive the petroleum industry. One day
earlier, in Houston, Dukakis outlined his energy program before an
audience of oil producers, saying he would support government
intervention if necessary to keep domestic wells in operation.
   Today in Longview, Bentsen told reporters, ``Five out of six
rigs that were active in 1981 are idle today. Two out of every five
jobs in the oil industry have been lost.''
   Standing in front of a rig hauled to the airport for the event,
with a huge American flag as a backdrop, Bentsen pointed to the
equipment as ``a sign of what's happened to Texas.''
   ``That piece of equipment shouldn't be here at the airport, it
should be out there working in the field,'' he said.
   ``George Bush will tell you he's an oilman, but when it comes to
an energy policy this administration has drilled a dry hole. It's a
real duster,'' he said.
   A day earlier, Dukakis said he would name Bentsen to head a
bipartisan energy summit as soon after the election as possible,
Dukakis said: ``With each passing month, we are becoming more
vulnerable to another oil embargo. At the rate we're going, by
1995, the United States will be 60 percent dependent on foreign
oil.''
   The energy summit is the second panel or commission to which
Dukakis has said he would appoint the Texas senator if the
Democratic ticket is elected. Dukakis has also said Bentsen would
head a council on the space program, which like oil has a definite
interest for Texas voters.
   The polls in Texas show the Democratic ticket trailing slightly
in the race for the state's 29 electoral votes.
   Dukakis, in a message Bentsen was to carry around the state
today, slammed Republican George Bush for doing nothing for the oil
industry as vice president. He said Bush's failure to appear at the
People for an Energy Policy forum, to which both tickets were
invited, was indicative.
   ``A former Texas oilman, and yet he doesn't have time to engage
in a discussion of energy,'' Dukakis said of Bush, accusing him in
his adopted home state of ignoring the important issues of the
campaign.
   ``My friends, we don't need any more speeches about the flag,''
he said. ``We need a president and vice president who are concerned
about America's energy future, and yours.''
   Dukakis said that at the same time energy demand has increased,
the domestic industry's production has gone down since President
Reagan took office. ``The last eight years in the energy industry
have been a roller coaster ride with the bottom knocked out.''
   Dukakis promised to remove barriers that have been blocking
increased use of natural gas in the country, to increase the
filling of the government's strategic oil reserve, and to boost
research on making oil fields more productive.
   He also promised to ``make Houston the EOR (enhanced oil
recovery) capital of the world,'' referring to techniques for
extracting more oil from a seemingly depleted well, and said his
program would help the oil industry more directly if necessary to
keep wells from shutting down.
   ``And when the market alone won't provide the incentive to
drill, a government led by Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen will,''
he said.
   Bentsen has made a career in Congress fighting on the side of
the oil industry. Dukakis said the Texas senator would be chairman
of ``a bipartisan energy summit just as soon after the election as
possible.''
   The group would ``design a comprehensive energy policy'' to make
sure producers and consumers had fair prices, he said. Dukakis'
speech made no mention of alternative energy sources such as
nuclear power or ethanol.
   ``Unlike either George Bush or Dan Quayle, Lloyd Bentsen has
been a leader in Congress,'' Dukakis said of his running mate, who
was seated nearby. The Massachusetts governor listed Bentsen's
accomplishments _ and Quayle's votes against the oil industry.
   ``Those votes say a lot about Mr. Quayle,'' he said. ``And they
say a lot about the man who selected him.''
   Bentsen, who introduced Dukakis to the gathering of several
hundred oil industry people from Texas and neighboring states, said
the Reagan administration had ``sentenced the Southwest to a deep
and painful recession.''
   ``I know a lot of my friends in the energy business tend to vote
Republican,'' he said. ``But I want to ask them: What has this
administration done to help your industry through the toughest
period in history?''
   Dukakis, he said, was the first of the Democrats to support
repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil and was not, as
Republicans claimed, opposed to all offshore drilling.

   A doctor who claims she contracted the AIDS
virus after being accidentally pricked by a discarded needle in a
hospital patient's bedding is suing the hospital, the city and two
other doctors for $175 million.
   In papers filed Friday in trial-level state Supreme Court,
Veronica Prego, 30, claims she was infected in January 1983 at
Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn. The syringe needle had been used
to draw blood from an AIDS patient, she said.
   At the time, Prego, a native of Argentina and a graduate of a
medical school there, was working as an unsalaried aide to a
hospital intern, Dr. Joyce Fogel, who is one of the defendants.
   Prego alleges that Fogel, who was treating the AIDS patient,
``negligently and improperly'' put three discarded needles on the
patient's bedding _ one of which stuck Prego as she was cleaning up.
   She charges that Fogel, and later hospital officials, assured
her they didn't know of any cases ``where a health care worker
contracted AIDS by means of a needle stick.'' Such contamination
recently has been shown to be possible.
   Prego also claims that the city's Health and Hospitals Corp. did
not supply any puncture-resistant disposal units for the
contaminated syringes and needles.
   The suit also names Sheldon Landsman, a doctor who had conducted
a state-sponsored survey of health and hospital employees working
with patients suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
She said Landsman violated her right to confidentiality by
informing hospital administrators about her condition.
   Janice Kabel, a lawyer representing the city, the HHC and Fogel,
said her clients have denied all substantive charges. She declined
to comment further.
   The state attorney general's office, which is representing
Landsman, also declined to comment.

<DATELINE>NASHUA, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On his last day in office, Education
Secretary William Bennett today praised the tradition of strong
local control in New Hampshire schools and downplayed the
importance of kindergarten for youngsters.
   ``It would be a shame for New Hampshire to veer toward state
control of education when we are telling other states to emulate
New Hampshire,'' Bennett said at a news conference.
   He cited just-released national statistics on Scholastic
Aptitude Tests as evidence that local control works. Average scores
for New Hampshire students were tops nationally among the 22 states
in which 40 percent or more of the students took the tests, which
are widely used in college admissions.
   Bennett, who appeared at the news conference with Republican
gubernatorial candidate Judd Gregg, was asked to comment on New
Hampshire's status as the only state not to require kindergarten
and Gregg's opposition to state-mandated kindergarten.
   Bennett did not answer directly, but said, ``There is no
research that conclusively proves that kindergarten gives kids a
jump.
   ``Yes, kindergarten is desireable,'' he said, ``but a good
first, second and third grade is more important than a good
kindergarten.''
   He added: ``No one suggests that New Hampshire's education
system is perfect. The general decline in education seen in the
United States is seen in New Hampshire, but New Hampshire, more
than many other states, is on the right track'' trying to reverse
the trend.
   Bennett went from Nashua to Hollis, where he was to briefly
teach reading and speak to an assembly at the Hollis Elementary
School, one of 287 winners nationwide in the Education Department's
school recognition program.
   He was also scheduled to go to Boston today for his last
official appearance as education secretary. Afterward, he planned
to go hiking in New Hampshire's White Mountains.

   A report by the National Academy of Sciences
called the growing number of homeless children ``a national
disgrace,'' yet was issued without its authors' strongest
recommendations and criticism of government failures, one
participant said today.
   While the academy published the bulk of the report, it declined
to include detailed recommendations.
   ``Those who served on the panel ... were a little disturbed that
we were not able to go into more detail on the problems of the
homeless and some of the corrective measures that should be
taken,'' Nathan Stark, a Washington lawyer and panel member, said
today.
   But Dr. Fred Solomon, of the academy's Institute of Medicine,
which sponsored the report, termed the recommendations ``not
sufficiently scholarly and documented to be included.''
   The additional comments were included in a supplemental
statement released today by Bruce C. Vladeck, president of the
United Hospital Fund of New York, who headed the 13-member study
group.
   Vladeck said the published report ``doesn't adequately convey
our sense of outrage and dismay at the phenomenon of homelessness.''
   The official academy study portrays a homeless America filled
not only with alcoholics and former mental patients but with
growing numbers of children and families scraping out a dismal
existence in rural communities.
   The study, ordered by Congress, estimates that on any given
night families with a total of 100,000 children are homeless, while
yet more children have run away or been kicked out by their parents.
   The 242-page report says children under 18 are the fastest
growing group among the nation's homeless and says this is
``nothing short of a national disgrace that must be treated with
the urgency that such a situation demands.''
   The only indication of the panel's stronger position comes in a
five-line footnote which says members of the committee
``unanimously wish to express their strong feeling that the
recommendations are too limited in addressing the broader issues of
homelessness _ especially the supply of low-income housing, income
maintenance, the availability of support services, and access to
health care for the poor and uninsured.''
   Dr. Frank Press, director of the National Academy of Sciences,
blocked publication of a supplemental statement signed by 10 of the
panel members. He was quoted in The New York Times today as saying
he did so because ``the language was charged and polemical and
emotional.''
   He said the academy has the obligation to ``stick to the data
and minimize the intrusion of values as much as possible.''
   The published report's recommendations include a list of largely
noncontroversial proposals covering eligibility standards, training
and program expansions.
   The report calls, for instance, for improved day care and Head
Start programs and efforts to make homeless parents aware of the
help available for their children. It recommends that food stamps
be allowed to be used in restaurants so people who don't have
kitchens can use them to save money.
   But deleted, said Vladeck, were calls for restoring a 70 percent
cut in low-income housing support since 1981, new treatments
services for the mentally ill and substance abusers, and an
increase in the minimum wage to make adequate housing affordable.
   The study did include, however, an appendix which blamed the
growing number of rural homeless on the failure of government
policymakers to recognize the extent of the rural economic crisis.
   Farm foreclosures, foreign competition that has wiped out
low-wage rural manufacturing jobs and the downturn in energy
industries have bred increased rural poverty and homelessness, says
the report by consultant Larry T. Patton.
   The report said there are no national studies pinning down the
numbers of homeless children, but it uses the most conservative of
several estimates to conclude that each night at least 100,000
children are in families that must resort to streets, organized
shelters or makeshift quarters.
   It cites estimates of the Alliance Housing Council, a homeless
advocacy group, that there are 735,000 homeless on any given night
and concludes that at least a quarter of them are members of
families and 55 percent of the family members are children.
   It also cites research by the group indicating that 1.3 million
to 2 million people will be homeless for one night or more in the
course of a year.
   The study acknowledges that accurate statistics on the homeless
are difficult to find.
   Meanwhile, the Census Bureau announced Monday that it will make
a special effort in 1990 to count the homeless. On March 20 of that
year, census takers will visit emergency shelters from 6 p.m. to
midnight and street locations where the homeless often congregate
between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
   During 10 months of research, the committee and its staff
visited agencies serving the homeless in 11 cities _ Boston,
Chicago, Kansas City, Lexington, Ky., Los Angeles, Milwaukee,
Nashville, San Diego, San Francisco, St. Louis and Washington _ and
rural areas in Alabama, Minnesota, Mississippi and North Dakota.

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 94-0 today to confirm Lauro
Cavazos as education secretary after members called the son of a
Texas cattleman an ``authentic American success story'' who is
committed to federal education programs.
   Cavazos, who was scheduled to be sworn in later this afternoon
at the White House, will be the first Hispanic member of a
president's Cabinet.
   ``He is an authentic American success story and an inspiration
to millions of young students,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.
   Other Democrats and Republicans praised the Texas Tech
University president's credentials and commitment to federal
education programs.
   ``Dr. Cavazos has a strong commitment to ensuring excellent
educational opportunities are available to all Americans,'' said
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, calling him ``living proof of the
American dream.''
   ``The Labor Committee held a confirmation hearing for Dr.
Cavazos and all of us were impressed with his commitment to federal
education programs,'' said Kennedy, chairman of the panel.
   ``For the last seven years, members of Congress from both sides
of the aisle have worked hard to ensure that the federal goverment
will continue to have a role in education. It is apparent that Dr.
Cavazos will be an ally in these efforts in the future,'' Kennedy
said.
   Cavazos, 61, is taking a leave of absence as president of the
medical school at Texas Tech. He is not a medical doctor, but has a
doctorate in physiology from Iowa State University.
   Cavazos was born on the fabled King Ranch of South Texas and
worked his way through undergraduate and graduate school after
serving in the Army.
   Prior to his appointment at Texas Tech in 1980, he was dean of
the Tufts Medical School in Boston.
   Cavazos is replacing outgoing Education Secretary William J.
Bennett.

<HEAD>Dukakis Outlines Health Insurance Plan; Bush Visits Flag Factory</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 6 grafs with Bush at flag plant, Dukakis in
Houston, picking up in 5th graf pvs, In advance</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis sought support among working people and
their families today by proposing requirements that all Americans
be covered by health insurance. Republican rival George Bush
visited a flag factory and said, ``I want to build an America that
inspires.''
   Bush told a rally outside the Annin flag company in Bloomfield,
N.J., ``My mission is simple: To build a better America. That
simple and that big.''
   Inside, he told plant workers, ``Today the flags you make still
inspire Americans and those who love our values the world over.''
Bush has said repeatedly in recent appearances that the flag
manufacturer has thrived during the Reagan administration,
contending that flag sales reflect a patriotic revival during the
Republicans' White House tenure.
   But Dukakis said Monday that ``we don't need more speeches about
the flag'' and then unveiled his broad health-insurance proposal
today.
   The Massachusetts governor opened his campaign day with stops at
a Houston medical center and two clinics, asking patients and
family members about medical costs and health insurance problems
and saying, ``I think it's time we did something. It's getting
worse.''
   He was to spell out details of the health plan during a speech
at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green.
   In advance, his campaign issued a statement saying that as
president, Dukakis would propose legislation to require all
employers to provide basic health plans for their workers _ a plan
aimed at providing benefits to about 22 million people who now have
none.
   The statement also said that Dukakis, if elected, would appoint
a task force to report by March 30, 1989, on follow-up legislation
to guarantee universal health coverage, thus extending benefits to
every American, working or not. That follow-up plan for all workers
presumably would require some federal financing, but the campaign
was silent on that question.
   Dr. David Blumenthal of Boston, Dukakis' health adviser, said 37
million to 40 million Americans have no health insurance.
   Dukakis' emphasis on health care was part of an effort to take
control of the political discussion rather than merely replying to
allegations by Bush.
   Continuing attacks he began last week on Dukakis' tenure as
Massachusetts governor, the Bush told a Chamber of Commerce
luncheon in Pennsylvania on Monday that the Democratic nominee had
an ``anti-business scheme.''
   He said business bankruptcies in Massachusetts rose 23.7 percent
during the first six months of the year while the national rate had
fallen 23.5 percent.
   Bush also accused Dukakis of running a divisive campaign, ``with
a calculated strategy of emphasizing differences between rich and
poor, between one region of the country and another.''
   Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen of Texas campaigned in
Houston on Monday, where Dukakis said he would support government
intervention if necessary to keep domestic oil wells operating.
   Dukakis also said he would appoint Bentsen, who has made a
congressional career of helping the oil industry, to a bipartisan
energy summit.
   Accusing Bush of changing his position on offshore drilling to
suit his campaign needs _ supporting it in Texas and opposing it in
California _ Dukakis told the audience of about 1,000:
   ``George Bush is like a coin. They just flip him. Sometimes he
lands on his head. Sometimes he lands on his tail.''
   Just as Bush did in Pennsylvania, Republican running mate Dan
Quayle of Indiana attacked Dukakis' record on the Massachusetts
economy during appearances in Knoxville, Tenn., and Casper, Wyo.
   Charging that Dukakis ``created an economic manacle'' in
Massachusetts, he said the state ranks 40th out of 50 states in
total employment growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth. It
actually lost 90,000 manufacturing jobs between June 1984 and
January 1988, he said.
   Quayle also went after Dukakis on what the Republicans contend
is his election-year conversion to a tougher defense. ``In just a
week his defense policy went from general confusion to General
Patton,'' he said.
   The Dukakis campaign swiftly countered the claims made by both
Republican candidates about the Massachusetts economy, bringing out
eight business leaders in Massachusetts to respond.
   ``My company has grown and prospered under the leadership of
Governor Dukakis,'' said one of them, Wang Computer Co. founder An
Wang, a Dukakis supporter. ``He created the atmosphere that made it
possible for us to grow.''
   Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said leading members of the
Democratic Party would be called on to rebut some Bush charges
while Massachusetts business and industry leaders would address
Bush comments about the state economy.
   Both Bush and Dukakis were limiting their campaign schedule this
week in order to prepare for Sunday's debate in Winston-Salem, N.C.
Despite the approaching encounter, the sides have not agreed on who
will ask the questions.
   A Media General-Associated Press poll, meanwhile, said Americans
see Dukakis as more compassionate and Bush as more competent, but
aren't convinced that either candidate can accomplish most of his
goals as president.
   Only 36 percent of those surveyed said Bush could accomplish
most of his goals as president, and just 31 percent said Dukakis
could achieve most of his goals. Nearly half said either would be
stymied. The rest were not sure.
   A University of Akron poll in Ohio showed Bush leading 43-39,
and one in New York by the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion showed Dukakis ahead 48-42, but the four-point margin of
error in each poll made the leads meaningless.
   A poll in Mississippi gave Bush a 49-34 lead. The poll by Rick
Knox and Associates had a five-point margin of error.

   Coup leader Gen. Saw Maung formed a
military-dominated government today and the official media reported
his troops killed 59 people, most of them in clashes with looters.
   One witness reported gunfire in downtown Rangoon tonight.
   On Monday, troops shot and killed at least 100 people in
quelling widespread opposition to Saw Maung's rule. More than 200
people have been reported killed since he seized power Sunday.
   Opposition leaders issued a joint statement calling for talks
with Saw Maung to resolve the crisis.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said Saw Maung was both the defense and
foreign affairs ministers in the new government. He was defense
minister and armed forces commander when he seized power Sunday
from civilian President Maung Maung.
   No president or prime minister was named today, and there was no
word on Maung Maung's fate.
   Only one of the nine Cabinet ministers named was a civilian,
Minister of Health Pe Thein. At least six ministers were among the
18 senior officers who mounted the coup with Saw Maung.
   The broadcast said the military commanders in each of the
country's seven states and seven divisions also would serve as the
top government representatives in those areas.
   Troops on Monday shot and killed at least 100 people protesting
the coup and the two sides battled late into the night. Some
protesters hurled gasoline bombs at troops who fired back.
   State radio reported five incidents today in which security
forces killed looters and other civilians.
   Troops dispersed a crowd of 50 people looting a warehouse eight
miles north of downtown Rangoon at 4 a.m., killing eight people,
the radio said. Sixteen people died when troops tried to stop more
than 200 people from looting a warehouse in the Thamaing campus of
Rangoon University, it said.
   Security forces shot and killed 16 people looting the Fisheries
Department head office in downtown Rangoon in the early morning,
and five people died as troops broke up looting at a biscuit
factory in the northern part of the capital, the radio said.
   Troops killed another 14 people when a military truck on patrol
in east Rangoon was attacked, it said.
   Witnesses reported one person was shot and killed as soldiers
halted looting at a market in the city.
   Sporadic clashes also were reported in Mandalay in central Burma
but no details were available. Telephone communications were out
after the communications department's microwave dish was damaged in
the morning, reportedly by some kind of rocket.
   Bloody protests and general strikes began Aug. 8, toppling
hard-line President Sein Lwin four days later.
   Today, military trucks rolled down Rangoon's streets with
loudspeakers warning soldiers would shoot anyone building
barricades, an Asian diplomat in Rangoon speaking on condition of
anonymity said.
   People hurried home after buying food at the few small shops
that were open.
   Three key opposition leaders issued a statement today condemning
the bloodshed and telling coup leaders that ``such suppression by
force of arms will not stop the people's just demand for
democracy.''
   They demanded talks with Saw Maung ``to seek ways to correctly
solve the current crisis.''
   The statement was issued by former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi, former
Defense Minister Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burma's
late independence leader.
   In the statement, they also rebuffed offers from the country's
ethnic insurgents to support the pro-democracy demonstrations, and
told authorities to stop spreading rumors that the rebels had
infiltrated the demonstrations.
   The top Buddhist monks organization also issued a statement
appealing for dialogue between the two sides.
   Saw Maung overthrew Maung Maung, who took over Aug. 19 as
Burma's first civilian leader since the 1962 military coup. Maung
Maung had ended martial law and withdrawn soldiers from the streets
as a concession to protesters. But the opposition demanded that he
allow an interim government conduct the democratic elections he had
promised.
   Troops returned in force after Sunday's coup by Saw Maung, who
said he took over to halt Burma's social chaos and ensure the
elections were held.
   On Monday, soldiers enforcing Saw Maung's ban on public
gatherings shot monks, students, government workers and other
unarmed demonstrators. Reporters conservatively estimated at least
100 dead. About 40 demonstrators and 17 soldiers died in clashes
Sunday.
   Some diplomats suggested Saw Maung seized power to save the
Burma Socialist Program Party, the target of months of widespread
street protests. Protesters blame the country's sole legal party
for 26 years of repression and economic ruin.
   Burma has been in turmoil since students rioted last September
against government economic policies. Security forces killed scores
of protesters in March and June, and demonstrations since July have
forced the resignations of longtime strongman Ne Win and his
successor, Sein Lwin, who lasted 17 days. At least 112 people died
in the rioting against Sein Lwin.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers from two more army units
ousted their commanders today in a spreading revolt begun three
days earlier when Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril seized power in a coup,
radio stations reported.
   At least three people were killed in the streets during the
night, the stations said. Nine other people have been reported
killed in the past two days.
   After a night of gunfire and violence in the streets of this
sprawling capital, non-commissioned officers and enlisted men of
the downtown fourth company arrested their commander, Maj. Renaud
Symbert, and deposited him unharmed in front of the downtown army
headquarters, the radio stations said.
   The stations said gunfire was heard at the army compound in
Mirebalais, about 25 miles northwest of the capital as soldiers
mutinied against their commander, Lt. Simeon Francois. The
lieutenant fled.
   On Monday, troops of the elite 300-man Leopards Battalion
handcuffed their leader, Col. Abelard Denis, to the entrance of
army headquarters. Firing automatic weapons triumphantly into the
air, they sped in vehicles back to their compound near the wealthy
suburb of Petionville.
   Soldiers of the 160-man Aviation Corps also briefly detained
their commander Monday before expelling him from their base in
Port-au-Prince.
   Avril, previously army adjutant general, proclaimed himself
president Sunday after a coup ousted Lt. Gen Henri Namphy, who ran
Haiti for most of the 2{ years since Jean-Claude Duvalier was
forced into exile in February 1986.
   Radio reports said police detective Henri Toussaint was shot and
killed, as were three unidentified brothers of Commander Roland
Chavannes of the traffic police.
   Gunshots filled the air all night and into the early hours
today. A government official, who asked not to be identified,
blamed the violence on ``uncontrollable elements.'' Gunmen cruised
the streets firing into the air. Haiti's new military government
issued a communique Monday calling on the populace to remain calm
and not seek vengeance.
   Avril told the nation he had appointed a mostly civilian Cabinet
that would ensure a transition to democracy, but made no mention of
plans for free elections.
   The new military ruler announced during an installation ceremony
carried Monday by state-run television that he had named 11
civilians and one army officer to the Cabinet ``for the definitive
installation of democracy.''
   ``We have our minds set on rising above parties and rival
factions to attain national reconciliation,'' Avril said.
   But opposition leaders have been skeptical of the new government.
   Radio stations earlier reported that mobs on Monday killed three
suspected members of the Tonton Moucoutes, a feared band of thugs
who were loyal to the Duvalier family dictatorship that ruled for
29 years until Jean-Claude's departure.
   The stations said the killings apparently were in reprisal for a
Sept. 11 church massacre in which unidentified hoodlums killed 13
people and wounded 77.
   Six other such mob killings were reported Sunday.
   Bernard Degraff, the government's assistant information officer,
said a realignment of the army would be announced shortly and would
involve the transfer, promotion and retirement of an unspecified
number of army officers.
   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the high command appeared to be delaying the military reshuffle to
assert its authority over the non-commissioned officers who led the
coup.
   Sources said that despite initial reports to the contrary, Lt.
Col. Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the dreaded 700-man Dessalines
Battalion, would not be elevated to armed forces commander in
chief. Paul has been indicted on drug charges by a federal court in
Florida.
   Degraff identified the army officer appointed to the new Cabinet
as Col. Carl Dorfainville, who was named interior and defense
minister, replacing Maj. Gen. Williams Regala.
   The government spokesman described Dorfainville as a political
moderate. He had been military commander of the west department of
Haiti.
   Among other members of the new Cabinet were veteran diplomat
Serge Eliecharles, who becomes Haiti's new foreign minister.
   Other appointed Cabinet members identified by Degraff were the
historian Remy Zamor, minister of education; economist Leonce
Thelusma, finance minister; journalist and teacher Anthony Virginie
Saint-Pierre, information minister; and Arnault Guerrier, minister
of social affairs.
   Guerrier formerly was administrative director under Jean-Claude
Duvalier, Namphy's provisional junta and Manigat.
   Other members of the Cabinet were not immediately identified.

   Firefighters working double shifts
today battled a wind-fanned arson blaze to the edge of this city as
flames destroyed seven homes, scorched more than 18,000 acres and
forced 500 people to flee.
   But in Montana and Wyoming, firefighters were sent home as cool,
moist fall weather helped them get a handle on the blazes that have
blackened hundreds of thousands of acres.
   Fifteen fires burning Monday had charred 1.39 million acres in
Wyoming, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, said
Arnold Hartigan of the Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho,
where the firefighting is coordinated. In all this season, 69,099
fires have blackened 4,140,000 acres, including about 2 million
acres in Alaska, he said.
   In Northern California, gusty wind combined with higher
temperatures to stir up two major blazes. The arson fire grew to
18,000 acres and jumped a containment line late Monday outside
Vacaville, about 55 miles northeast of San Francisco. It reached
within a third of a mile of town, said fire captain Ken Thomas.
   Authorities established a new line today along a 10-mile stretch
of road, along which the 500 residents were ordered to evacuate,
said fire captain John Ferreira.
   ``We're leaving,'' said David Foster, 33, one of Vacaville's
61,000 residents. ``Staying around would be stupid.''
   Ferreira said firefighters were optimistic about holding the
blaze.
   ``If today goes well for us, we should have 100 percent
containment Thursday,'' he said. Officials predicted that afternoon
wind could push the blaze toward scattered homes to the west of the
fire line at the western edge of town.
   Along Interstate 80, the glow from the fire could be seen 13
miles away, from Cordelia. Thick smoke drifted through downtown
Vacaville.
   The fire started Saturday north of Vacaville is one of two major
California blazes that have destroyed 15 homes as they roared
across 26,000 acres of wildland, brush and timber.
   At the 8,000-acre fire near Redding in Shasta County, two men
clearing burned timber suffered head and back injuries Monday when
a tree fell on them, officials said. Both were hospitalized in
critical condition, officials said.
   Officials said that fire was caused when someone apparently
target shooting shot out an insulator from a powerline about 20
miles east of Redding, 220 miles northeast of San Francisco, and
the sparks ignited the drought-dry brush.
   Eighty firefighters were left today to mop up at Montana's only
remaining major forest fire, a 34,500-acre blaze in Glacier
National Park. ``I think fire season is just about over here,''
said spokeswoman Madelyn Kempf said, adding it had rained through
most of the night.
   In Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park officials released 1,000
soldiers who were in the park for more than 30 days battling the
flames that involved half the 2.2 million-acre park.
   Officials also started to release employees of the National Park
Service, U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
   Cooler conditions, shorter days and higher humidities helped
limit fire activity.
   The Vacaville fire destroyed seven homes, 10 outbuildings and $7
million worth of telecommunications equipment, officials said.
   Although no incendiary device was recovered in Miller Canyon,
where most of the destroyed homes were located, arson was
suspected, said Ferreira.
   Three other blazes began in the area since Saturday but they
have been contained, officials said.
   Crews fighting the Redding fire reported progress with 60
percent of the blaze contained. Crews were expected to encircle the
blaze tonight and bring it under control by Wednesday evening,
forestry officials say.
   Six homes and six other structures were burned on Sunday and
about 300 people were evacuated, but authorities said they were
allowed to return to home Monday.
   Lower temperatures in the 60s and 70s, 30 percent to 35 percent
humidity and 5 mph winds helped the 920 firefighters working to
build 5.5 miles of line around the fire, authorities said.
   Firefighters also used 85 engines, seven helicopters, eight
airtankers, and 31 water tankers in their effort, estimating fire
suppression costs at $400,000.

<HEAD>Independence Referendum For Western Sahara Annnounced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council unanimously voted
today to approve an independence referendum for Western Sahara,
where Marxist guerrillas haven been battling Morocco's occupation
forces for 13 years.
   The 15-0 Security Council vote approved the appointment of a
special representative of the secretary-general to monitor a
referendum that would result in Western Sahara's independence or
affiliation with Morocco.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar reminded the members
of the council that on Aug. 30, representatives of the Polisario
independence movement and Morocco met with him in Geneva to approve
the referendum and peace plan, with certain reservations.
   ``The proposals aimed at the restoration of peace in the region
provide a framework for the conclusion of a cease-fire and the
establishment of conditions necessary for the organization of a
credible referendum,'' said the U.N. chief.
   ``The referendum will be organized and monitored by the United
Nations in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity,'' he
said. The organization has played a major role in arranging the
dialogue between Polisario and Morocco.
   Perez de Cuellar said a special representative from his office,
a civilian unit, a military unit and a security unit would work for
peace in the area.
   ``The proposals also provide that the Kingdom of Morocco will
carry out an appropriate, substantial and gradual reduction of its
troops in the Western Sahra,'' with remaining soldiers to be
barracked under the supervision of U.N. military observers.
   Polisario's fighters would also be quartered under U.N.
supervision.
   The Marxist-led Polisario movement of about 8,000 fighters has
been battling for the independence of Western Sahara since Spain's
colonial administration withdrew in 1975-76, and Moroccan
occupation troops took over the phosphate-rich desert territory in
northwest Africa.
   More than 10,000 people have died in the nearly 13-year-old
guerrilla war, which has cost Morocco up to $2 million a day to
fight.
   Western Sahara covers about 110,000 square miles. Its population
was set at 76,000 in 1974, during the last Spanish colonial census.
   Under the U.N. plan, only people born in the territory may vote
in the referendum.
   Determining who is eligible will be a major chore for the
referendum monitors. Polisario claims about 165,000 eligible
Western Saharans live in its refugee camps near Tindouf in Algeria,
which funds and shelters Polisario, but Morocco says they are not
eligible.
   Morocco claims that 90 percent of the 150,000 residents of
Moroccan-occupied sections of Western Sahara are eligible, but
Polisario says two-thirds of them are Moroccan immigrants.

   He was named to the roving correspondent post in 1984. In May of
that year he was wounded in a bomb explosion at the jungle
headquarters of Nicaraguan rebel leader Eden Pastora. Four
reporters were killed and 20 people injured.
   Gray, 38, a native of Greenwood, Miss., graduated from Memphis
State University in Tennessee and worked for the Memphis
Commercial-Appeal before joining the AP in Memphis in 1975. He
transferred to the World Services Department in New York in 1983,
was named correspondent in Nairobi in 1985, and bureau chief there
in 1986.

   A space official said Tuesday that Israel's
first satellite was performing better than expected, and he denied
reports the craft is carrying cameras to spy on Arab nations.
   ``I am very enthusiastic about the excellent results,'' Moshe
Ortas of Israel Aircraft Industries said on Israel radio.
``Everything is going according to calculations, even better.''
   The launch Monday, which made Israel the eighth nation to place
a satellite in space, provoked sharp protests from Arab neighbors.
   A state-run newspaper in Syria, Israel's main enemy in the
Middle East, accused the United States of helping launch the
satellite and said it would threaten the Arab world.
   ``As part of the (Israeli-U.S.) strategic alliance, the enemy
launched a spy satellite with the help of the United States...for
military purposes. This is a new threat to the Arab nation,'' the
Tishrin newspaper said.
   But Charles Redman, the State Department spokesman, denied the
United States had any involvement in the launch.
   Pentagon officials say they are unsure what is in the
satellite's payload. ``We're leaning toward more of an experimental
communications package as opposed to a true spy satellite,'' said
one source who demanded anonymity.
   In Washington, Arab League representative Clovis Maksoud said
the satellite gave Israel ``a serious strategic leverage'' since
the country already had the capability to fire long-range missiles.
   The Libyan news agency JANA, monitored in London, described the
craft as a ``spy satellite (and part of a) psychological war being
carried out by the Zionists against the Arab nation.''
   Newspaper editorials in other Arab capitals urged Arabs to pool
resources to match Israel's technological advances.
   Ortas denied claims the 340-pound test satellite, named Horizon
I, was carrying surveillance equipment.
   ``We aren't getting pictures. We don't have anything to get
pictures from. There is no means to get pictures,'' said Ortas,
vice president of the electronics division of the agency that
launched the satellite.
   A spokesman for the London-based magazine Jane's Defense Weekly
said the satellite was carrying a 6.6-pound payload for
surveillance purposes, apparently for monitoring activity in Arab
countries.
   Because Israel is not thought to have the capability of
installing sophisticated surveillance equipment in a satellite,
U.S. optical equipment was believed to be aboard, the spokesman
added.
   Tony Banks, a Jane's reporter with close ties to the Israeli
military, said the satellite was unlikely to provide much useful
surveillance because of the direction of its orbit.
   ``It only gets two decent passes in any 24-hour period over Arab
countries and one of these is during darkness which means no sight
capability except, perhaps, by infrared light, which is not as
good,'' Banks said.
   ``It's very chancey it's going to see anything at all,'' he said
in an interview Monday from London.
   Israeli officials said the craft was expected to stay aloft for
a month.
   Development of the craft came after more than 20 years of
Israeli space research and was seen as part of the country's effort
to become independent in the defense field.
   Until now, Israel has relied on the United States to provide
satellite pictures, but some former Israeli officials have
complained the United States was stingy in supplying intelligence
information.
   In March 1987, former U.S. Navy analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard was
sentenced to life in prison for selling Israel hundreds of U.S.
military documents.
   Israeli media have quoted U.S. and Israeli sources as saying the
documents Pollard delivered included satellite pictures of Iraqi
and Syrian weapons and storage facilities.
   A recent source of possible concern to Israel is that Saudi
Arabia is deploying Chinese-built, CSS-2 missiles 285 miles south
of Riyadh.
   Satellite photographs displayed by Space Media Network, a
private Swedish company, showed the Saudis were expanding an
airstrip and a military complex to accommodate the new weapons.
   Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy, a retired head of military
intelligence, said earlier this week that Israel would save money
on reconnaisance flights by conventional aircraft and drones.
   Saguy said another benefit to Israel of having its own satellite
was they pose fewer political problems than surveillance aircraft
or pilotless planes.

<HEAD>Rumors of Cult Hearings Die Down, Students Return to Class</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with attendance normal today</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attendance returned to normal today at
Caldwell County High School, where students had been kept from
class by parents worried about rumors that a satanic cult planned
to come to school and kill people.
   About 350 youths _ two-thirds of the student body _ left school
in a ``panic'' Friday, and about 100 students were absent Monday,
said acting police chief John Dunning and Principal Ray Wilson.
Attendance also was down at the county middle school and grade
schools, officials said.
   Today, though, 95 percent of the school's students were in
class, said Charlie Elder, director of pupil personnel. Attendance
is normally about 94 percent to 95 percent, he said.
   ``It's calmed down quite a bit,'' Dunning said. ``We've got a
few called today, but not as many as yesterday (Monday), and not
near as many as Friday.''
   Wilson and Dunning said there was no evidence of any threat to
students.
   ``A rumor got started at the high school, apparently by one of
the students, to the effect that some people from Christian County
were going to come to the high school sometime Friday during school
hours and start killing people,'' Dunning said.
   ``We are continuing to look into the matter, but with no
evidence, we are going on the assumption it is a rumor started by
some kids that has gotten completely out of hand.''
   Another rumor, Dunning said, was that a note was left with a
gutted black cat that said ``they'' would be back to get blond,
blue-eyed students. Dunning said the only cat found anywhere near
the school was a black one found dead in a road Thursday night.
   ``It didn't have a note attached to it and it had been run
over,'' he said.
   Dunning said many students called their parents Friday.
   ``It created a panic. At one time, they were calling students to
the office five and six at a time ... telling them their parents
were there to pick them up,'' he said.
   Those who left and stayed out Monday were not been punished,
Wilson said.
   But he said funding was affected. In Kentucky, schools are
funded largely on the basis of average daily attendance. If
attendance is low, the average drops, and so does the amount of
money the system receives.

   Two gunmen firing from a taxi wounded
a Venezuelan diplomat as he drove to work today in Medellin, Mayor
Juan Gomez Martinez said.
   The Venezuelan consul for Medellin, Luis Alberto Altubel Lopez,
was slightly wounded by a bullet that hit him in a lip, Gomez said.
   The gunmen pulled up next to the consul's car as it was stopped
in traffic, leaned out the taxi's windows and opened fired, the
mayor said.
   Altubel was on his way to the consulate when he was shot, the
mayor said in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain
Caracol.
   After the attack, Altubel managed to drive to the consulate,
Gomez told radio Caracol. The taxi used by the gunmen was found
abandoned a few blocks from the scene of the shooting.
   The motive for the attack was not known.
   Right-wing death squads have killed more than 50 people in
Medellin in the last two years, and left-wing guerrillas have been
active in the area for a decade.
   Medellin also is the headquarters for Colombia's biggest cocaine
traffickers. A war between Medellin's cocaine traffickers and those
in another Colombian city, Cali, has claimed more than 80 lives
this year.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Kills Three In Beirut As Christian Lawmakers Meet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb killed three people in east
Beirut on Tuesday as Christian lawmakers met to choose a
presidential candidate to challenge the nominee favored by the
United States and Syria.
   Police said 25 people were wounded in the blast at 9 a.m. in
east Beirut's densely-populated Dora district. Among the wounded
was former Information Minister Joseph Skaff, 50, who was heading
in a motorcade through Dora for the conclave of Christian
parliament members.
   A police spokesman said Skaff, a Greek Catholic, did not attend
the meeting and was admitted to a hospital in east Beirut for
treatment for minor cuts and burns in the head and neck.
   Parliament is scheduled to meet Thursday to pick a successor to
President Amin Gemayel, whose 6-year-term ends Friday.
   Failure to elect a new president would plunge Lebanon into a
constitutional crisis that could trigger a new round of violence in
the nation's 13-year civil war that has killed more than 130,000
people.
   The police spokesman said Skaff's three bodyguards also suffered
minor wounds when the bomb filled with 110 pounds of TNT exploded.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with police
regulations, said the other casualties were pedestrians, motorists
or shopkeepers.
   The explosion, the 13th car bombing in Lebanon this year,
destroyed 43 cars parked in the street, shattered glass and started
several fires, the spokesman said. He said fire engines took an
hour to put out the flames.
   By police count, 104 people have been killed and 378 wounded in
the previous 12 car bombings.
   A Christian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
charged that the car bombing was ``designed to block the Bkirki
meeting.''
   However, 27 of the 41 Christian parliament deputies took part in
the four-hour meeting at Bkirki, the seat of the Maronite Catholic
patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, 12 miles north of Beirut.
   They met to try to agree on a presidential candidate after
rejecting a Syrian-American agreement to name deputy Mikhail Daher.
   A statement issued after the session said they will meet again
Wednesday ``after consulting with other (non-Christian) deputies.''
   The statement said Christian deputies ``stress'' that Parliament
should convene Thursday as called for by Shiite Moslem House
Speaker Hussein Husseini to elect a new president.
   But they called on Husseini to shift the meeting from the old
parliament building in Moslem west Beirut to the Villa Mansour in
the no-man's land of the city's dividing Green Line to facilitate
participation of Christian deputies.
   The date falls one day before Gemayel's term in office expires.
Under the constitution, he cannot seek a second consequtive term.
   A spokesman for Sfeir has said he expects the Christian deputies
to nominate veteran Maronite politician Raymond Edde.
   Edde, living in Paris since 1976 after surviving three
assassination attempts in Beirut, announced last week he will run
for president.
   ``Edde is acceptable to Moslem parliament deputies. His
nomination will create an atmosphere of democratic competition
within Parliament. This is what we want to preserve,'' said Sfeir's
spokesman, who demanded anonymity.
   Edde told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from
Paris on Saturday that if elected, he will first seek an Israeli
withdrawal from a self-designated security zone in south Lebanon,
then ask the Syrians to leave.
   He warned that unless he succeeds in forcing the Israelis out,
he would not return to Lebanon and would ask Parliament to elect
another president.
   Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist leaders have threatened to
declare a separate republic in territory they control if Gemayel
seeks to resolve the crisis by appointing a Maronite prime minister
to head a caretaker Cabinet.
   According to an unwritten national covenant dating to Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943, the president should be a
Maronite, house speaker a Shiite, and prime minister a Sunni Moslem.
   Christian deputies boycotted a session at Villa Mansour Aug. 18,
preventing Parliament from mustering a quorum of 51 voters to elect
a president.
   The only serious candidate at the time was Syrian-backed former
president Suleiman Franjieh. Christians rejected him as too closely
aligned with Syria.
   Moslem politicians charged that the main Christian militia was
working at Israel's bidding to trying to undermine the elections.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south Beirut.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Ready To Meet Leaders Of All Namibian Factions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations chief has
invited leaders of all political parties in South-West Africa to
meet him when he comes to discuss independence for the territory,
an official said Tuesday.
   Louis Pienaar, South Africa's senior representative in the
territory commonly known as Namibia, said the U.N. leader had set
aside more than two hours Thursday for these consultations during a
visit to South Africa.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was to arrive at
a Pretoria air force base late Wednesday on his first visit to
South Africa since 1983.
   He is scheduled to meet Friday with President P.W. Botha to
discuss the U.N.'s plan for Namibian independence.
   Pienaar said Namibian political leaders had until Wednesday
morning to say whether they wished to see Perez de Cuellar. There
was no immediate response from the South-West African People's
Organization, which has waged a pro-independence insurgency since
1966.
   South Africa governs Namibia in violation of U.N. resolutions
calling for its independence. It has agreed to end its 73-year rule
and allow U.N. observers to oversee the transition to independence,
but only if Cuban troops withdraw from neighboring Angola.
   U.S.-mediated talks involving Angola, Cuba and South Africa have
made progress toward a regional settlement, but there has been no
agreement on a timetable for withdrawal of the more than 50,000
Cuban troops. The talks are expected to resume next week in
Brazzaville, Congo.
   South Africa wants the Cubans out in one year, the span of time
that Resolution 435 specifies for Namibia's transition to
independence.
   Cuba and Angola have demanded a longer withdrawal period. South
Africa claims they are seeking a chance to crush the anti-Marxist
rebel movement UNITA now that South Africa troops supporting the
guerrillas have left Angola.
   Perez de Cuellar is scheduled to visit Angola on Saturday.
   His trip coincides with a flurry of reports of broader peace
intiatives.
   Zaire's pro-Western president, Mobutu Sese Seko, has been quoted
as saying he, Botha and Angolan leaders have agreed to participate
in talks aimed at achieving reconciliation in Angola. He did not
indicate whether UNITA would participate in such talks. Angola says
it will not negotiate with the rebels.
   On Tuesday, the Financial Times of London said there were
tentative plans for a meeting between Botha and President Kenneth
Kaunda of Zambia, one of Africa's most prominent statesmen.
Possible topics included Namibia, reconciliation in Angola, and the
recent improvement of relations between South Africa and
Mozambique, the Financial Times said.
   Botha visited Mozambique on Sept. 12 for talks with President
Joaquim Chissano, whose Marxist government has long accused South
Africa of backing anti-government guerrillas.

<HEAD>Parliamentarians Urge Peace Prize for Reagan and Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of Finland's Parlament
members appealed Tuesday to the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award
the 1988 Peace Prize to President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   The petition, signed by 140 members from all parties in the
200-member Parliament, praised ``the unique realism and the
exceptionally open-minded attitude of the two superpower leaders
when dealing with bilateral questions.''
   It cited the agreement the two leaders signed in December to
eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons from the U.S. and
Soviet arsenals.
   Reagan and Gorbachev reportedly were nominated before the Feb. 1
deadline for this year's prize. The committee never confirms who
the candidates are.
   Markus Aaltonen, chairman of Parliament's Foreign Affairs
Committee who initiated the petition, described it as ``a unique
move'' aimed at drawing attention to efforts to advance detente.
   The Peace Prize will be announced in Oslo on Sept. 29.

   Fire swept through eight bars and
businesses in the city's ``red light'' district Tuesday, forcing
scores of patrons, bartenders and dancers into the streets.
   Brig. Gen. Ernesto Madriaga, the city's fire marshall, said the
blaze in the city's Ermita district was brought under control after
about two hours, and there were no reports of deaths nor serious
injuries.
   Officials said the cause of the fire had not been determined.
   There was no estimate of damage.

<TEXT>
   A psychologist who studied drug therapies for
hyperactive mentally retarded children has pleaded guilty in
federal court to falsifying research data in order to obtain
federal funds.
   Stephen E. Breuning, 36, pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of
making false statements to the National Institute of Mental Health
in Bethesda.
   As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend that
Breuning be barred from working as a research psychologist for 10
years and that he make $20,000 restitution to his former employer,
the University of Pittsburgh, which has repaid the federal
institute more than $163,000.
   They also agreed to drop a charge that Breuning obstructed the
institute's investigation of his data's authenticity.
   Breuning claimed to have done the research while working at a
psychiatric clinic affiliated with the university's medical school
from 1982 to 1984. But while he claimed that 99 patients
participated in the studies, only 25 students received the drugs,
according to E. Thomas Roberts, an assistant U.S. attorney.
   U.S. District Judge Frank A. Kaufman set sentencing for Nov. 10.
The maximum possible sentence is 10 years in prison and $20,000 in
fines. Breuning remains free on bond.
   According to the mental health institute, Breuning had a
significant impact in the field of drug therapies for hyperactive
retarded children, finding that stimulants such as Ritalin and
Dexedrine helped control such children with fewer adverse side
effects than the tranquilizers previously used.
   Breuning was employed at the Polk Center in Polk, Pa., a
state-run residential center for the mentally retarded when he was
indicted April 9. He no longer works in his field and has been
living in Michigan, said his attorney, Charles S. Lazar.

   The police commander in a
trash-filled district of Manila has offered to pay residents $5 for
every 1,000 flies they capture.
   Lt. Col. Romeo Maganto, who is well known for going after
suspected communist assassins in the slum district of Tondo, said
the bounty is part of his area's effort to prevent an outbreak of
insect-borne diseases.
   ``If we cannot do away with this garbage, I think it is better
to eliminate these creatures that bring sickness,'' said Maganto.
He said inmates in his station's jail have been assigned to count
the flies before they are burned.
   Tondo is the site of Manila's biggest dump, called Smokey
Mountain, where officials say 300 tons of refuse is dumped daily.
The bounty project is being funded by several civic and business
organizations.

   Hundreds of radical students demanding
the Olympics be stopped burned U.S. flags and yelled ``Drive out
the Yankees'' in scattered protests Tuesday.
   About 100 students taking part in a protest at Donguk University
in central Seoul burned a huge American flag outside the Shilla
Hotel where the International Olympic Committee is staying.
   Riot police in green combat fatigues and black visored helmets
watched, but did not intervene as jeering students burned the flag
and shouted slogans after marching out of the main gate of the
school across the road from the hotel.
   ``Get out Yankees who support the dictatorial regime,'' the
students chanted as the 10-foot-high flag doused in gasoline went
up in orange flames.
   Protesters dispersed peacefully after the incident and did not
try to approach the heavily guarded hotel. Passersby ignored the
protest.
   During a rally at Donguk, the radicals demanded the Olympics be
halted because they claimed the Games were being used by the United
States, Japan and South Korea to stage military maneuvers. The
Games run through Oct. 2.
   U.S. and Japanese forces are helping South Korea protect the
Olympics from any potential threat from communist North Korea. The
United States has 42,000 troops based in the South under a defense
treaty.
   About 400 students later held a peaceful anti-government protest
at Konkuk University where they burned a sign with a U.S. flag
painted on it and burned another large American flag.
   Student leaders denounced the South Korean and U.S. governments,
charging they were using the Olympics to continue authoritarian
rule.
   ``We will continue to fight to topple the fascist regime and the
United States that support luxurious Olympics which oppress the
poor,'' a student leader told the crowd at Konkuk.
   ``Oppose dictatorial Olympics,'' students chanted.
   Small, peaceful anti-government protests also were reported on
some other Seoul campuses.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to
co-host the Games was rejected. South Korean officials fear the
North may stage a terrorist attack to disrupt the Games.
   Radical students, opposed to the Olympics because North Korea is
not participating, have staged a number of protests in recent days.
   The protests have been small and mostly peaceful with just a
handful of hardliners taking part.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador To Mongolia Presents Credentials _ Then Leaves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States' first ambassador to the
Mongolian People's Republic flew in this month, presented his
credentials and hopped a train back out, heading for his office in
Washington.
   ``It's a beautiful country,'' Ambassador Richard Williams told a
news conference Tuesday in Beijing, where he stopped en route.
   It also could become a useful post for tracking developments
inside Mongolia's huge socialist neighbors, China and the Soviet
Union, as they move slowly to heal their rift of more than two
decades.
   But he has no plans to move there. When the United States
established relations with Mongolia in 1987, the State Department
decided the remote, frigid country was too harsh a post for
permanent residence.
   Instead, Williams will be the only American ambassador working
out of a State Department office. He will continue holding his
previous post, as head of the department's China affairs office,
and make periodic trips to Mongolia.
   Two junior U.S. diplomats have been stationed in the capital of
Ulan Bator for six months, working out of an apartment building,
but they will leave for the winter, Williams said.
   During his 10-day visit to Ulan Bator, Williams said he
discussed with the Mongolians possibilities for finding permanent
facilities for an embassy and staff. But he said the prospect of
living there himself ``would take some thinking about.''
   ``The winters go down to 40 to 50 below zero,'' he said. ``It's
a little daunting.''
   Mongolia has been closely allied to the Soviet Union since
declaring its independence from China in 1921. Mongolia has ties
with 100 countries, but only 18 maintain embassies in Ulan Bator,
most of them East bloc nations.
   Many have supplies sent in from relatively luxurious Beijing to
supplement the Mongolian diet of mutton and sour milk.
   Williams said his main concerns are to aid Americans who travel
in Mongolia and develop U.S.-Mongolian trade, which averages $3
million annually, mostly in cashmere and camel's hair exports to
the United States.
   But he acknowledged the new relationship ``can provide us with
an interesting additional view of the state of Mongolian-Soviet,
Mongolian-Chinese and Sino-Soviet relations.''
   The Soviet Union stations nearly 50,000 troops in Mongolia,
Williams said, and their presence is one of several key problems
blocking normalization of Chinese-Soviet relations. The Soviets
pulled an estimated 12,000 soldiers out in 1987, but have not
scheduled further withdrawals.
   Mongolia took the Soviet side in the bitter Soviet-Chinese split
of the early 1960s, but recently has followed Moscow's lead and
improved ties with China. A Mongolian parliamentary delegation
visited Beijing this month for the first time.
   Williams said the United States considered establishing ties
with Mongolia in the 1960s but did not want to offend the
Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan, which claims Mongolia as
part of China. The United States broke ties with the Nationalists
in 1979 and recognized the government in Beijing.
   U.S. and Mongolian diplomats discussed establishing ties in the
1970s, but Mongolia broke off the talks unexpectedly and new
efforts began only in 1986, Williams said.

   Security forces in Somalia have executed hundreds
of unarmed civilians during anti-rebel operations this summer, and
political prisoners are systematically tortured, a human rights
group said in a report Wednesday.
   The Amnesty International report says human rights have been
``persistently violated'' during President Mohamed Siad Barre's 19
years in power and that violations have intensified recently in
countering rebel groups.
   ``Between several hundred and as many as 1,000 people have been
summarily executed'' by government forces in northern regions since
heavy fighting began in May, said Martin Hill, a spokesman for the
international organization.
   The killings, sometimes during house-to-house searches for
Ethiopian-backed rebels, appeared aimed at terrorizing civilian
sympathizers, he said.
   An estimated 200 prisoners also have been executed after summary
trials in the last three years, he said.
   The London-based organization said it had compiled evidence of
``a consistent pattern'' of torture, arbitrary arrests and unfair
trials of suspected government opponents.
   Torture victims said they were subjected to electric shocks and
sexual assault, wounded with knives, suspended upside  conducted house-to-house
searches and
``arbitrarily killed many people,'' it said.
   Foreign relief agency workers reported 21 people were dragged
from their homes and shot to death in separate incidents on May 31
and June 1, it said.
   ``These were all deliberate extrajudicial executions of alleged
political opponents as distinct from the indiscriminate heavy
casualties caused by the battle in the town or subsequent
bombardment by the government forces,'' the report said.
   Hill said the 600,000 people of Hargeisa ``by and large were
fleeing and the town is now virtually empty.''
   ``There seem to be deliberate attacks on civilians (in urban
areas), but the security forces aren't sufficiently organized to
sweep through the countryside,'' he said.
   Hill said a British reporter accompanying government troops
during anti-rebel offensives this summer estimated that between
30,000 and 50,000 people have been killed in mainly aerial
bombardments.
   The report said many prisoners held solely for the non-violent
expression of their beliefs have been kept for years in deplorable
conditions, often incommunicado and without proper medical aid.
   Yusuf Osman Samantar, a lawyer and former member of Parliament,
has been in prison without charge for nearly 19 years, while Safia
Hashi Madar, an employee of a U.S. relief agency and a former
science lecturer, was jailed for life in 1986 for ``membership of a
subversive organization,'' the report said.
   Others include parliamentarians, doctors, clerics, businessmen,
students and refugees, it said.

<TEXT>
   Large contingents of police were deployed in
mixed Jewish-Arab areas Tuesday as Israelis started the 25-hour
fast of Yom Kippur, the day of atonement and the most sacred
holiday on the Jewish calendar.
   Traffic on the nation's highways came to a halt, commercial
flights were suspended and the border with Egypt and bridges to
Jordan were closed.
   State-run Israel radio and television and Israel army radio
stopped transmitting, the only day of the year they do so.
   Yom Kippur came during a period of unprecedented conflict
between Israel and the 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Over the past nine months, more than 265 Palestinians and six
Israelis have been killed in what has come to be known as the
intefadeh, Arabic for uprising. To prevent violence, police stepped
up security in Jerusalem's mixed neighborhoods and other
Jewish-Arab areas of the country.
   The army announced that as a security precaution Palestinians
from the occupied territories would be barred from entering Israel
between 2 p.m. Tuesday and 8 p.m. Wednesday.
   Yom Kippur ends the ``Ten Terrible Days'' during which,
according to Jewish faith, God decides who will live through the
coming year and who will die.
   During this period from the onset of the Jewish New Year until
Yom Kippur, Jews bless each other with the greeting ``Gmar Hatima
Tova _ May you be inscribed in the book of life.''
   Before sundown, religious Jews shed leather shoes and belts and
don white robes to prepare for the Kol Nidre service, the special
prayer for forgiveness and life, which begins Yom Kippur.
   Early Tuesday, many Jews went to stores and markets to carry out
the ancient rite of kapparot. Waving the chickens over their head,
the penitents prayed that their sins would be transferred to the
sacrificial chickens. Afterwards, the chickens were slaughtered.
   Stores, commercial and government offices, and public
transportation shut down early to give workers time to prepare for
the fast.
   A survey by the Hadashot daily indicated that 69 percent of
Israeli Jews would fast even though the regularly observant portion
of the population is estimated at only about 20 percent.
   In a reflective article on Yom Kippur in the left-wing daily
``Davar,'' columnist Amnon Dankner wrote:
   ``For many free and wild souls, Yom Kippur is their last link
with Judaism, in which not only the religious intent is important.
It is more like taking part in a sporting event which measures
willpower, restraint, and even spirituality.''
   Tuesday also marked the 15th anniversary of the 1973 Middle East
war which began on Yom Kippur when Egyptian and Syrian armies
thrust through Israeli lines in the occupied Sinai Desert and Golan
Heights and briefly threatened to invade Israel itself.
   On the eve of Yom Kippur, bereaved families layed wreaths and
flowers at the gravesides of the 3,000 Israeli troops who died in
the 1973 Middle East war.
   Israeli newspapers printed reminiscences and commentaries about
the war.
   Davar's editor, Hanna Zemer, recalled that Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat had offered Israel a territorial settlement in 1971 and
drew parallels between those days and today.
   ``Before the Yom Kippur war, Israel did not agree to withdraw
from the Suez Canal. And that was not the only instance which
showed that Israel knows how to compromise...only after paying the
price for the stubborness which preceded it. We always come to the
right conclusions too late.''

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
lost ground among voters when he wore army gear and rode around in
a tank a week ago, according to a new poll.
   A national telephone survey of 1,002 registered voters last
Friday through Sunday found that 25 percent said they were less
likely to vote for Dukakis based on what they had seen or heard
about the tank ride.
   Seven percent said the ride made them more likely to vote for
Dukakis. More than 60 percent said that they had not seen or read
anything about it or that it had no impact on how they would vote.
   Dukakis donned a military helmet and jump suit last Tuesday and
took a spin in a 60-ton M-1 tank as part of an effort to counter
Republican portrayals of him as weak on defense.
   The poll, taken for the Boston Herald and WBZ-TV of Boston, had
a 3 percent margin of error.

   Four people were found shot to death
execution-style today just outside this Florida Panhandle
community, and police said the slayings may have been drug-related.
   The three men and one woman were gunned down about 1:30 a.m.,
but other details were sketchy, said Capt. Don Parker of the
Escambia County sheriff's department.
   He said the execution-style nature of the shootings led
investigators to suspect they may be drug-related.
   ``That's almost always bad guy against bad guy,'' Parker said.
   The shootings took place in a small duplex in the Pleasant Grove
suburb, and all of the victims were found in one room,
investigators said.
   At mid-day, investigators were still trying to identify the
bodies, Parker said.
   No arrests have been made.

   The cockpit from the Aloha Airlines
Boeing 737 that lost part of its fuselage during a flight between
two Hawaiian islands will be turned into a training simulator, an
official of the company that bought it said.
   Paul Hancock, director of marketing for FlightSafety
International, said Monday that the company, which makes flight
simulators used to train pilots, was searching for a 737 cockpit
when it discovered that the salvaged Aloha aircraft was being sold.
   ``We recently launched a program to build a 737 simulator and in
order to do that, we have to duplicate the cockpit of the
aircraft,'' Hancock said. ``That can be done a number of ways, but,
if possible, we look for a salvage cockpit. We heard about this
cockpit and jumped on a plane to go see.''
   A section of the upper fuselage of the 19-year-old plane tore
away during an inter-island hop April 28, but the pilot managed to
bring the crippled plane to a safe landing on Maui. Officials said
it was miraculous that only one person was killed in the accident,
although 69 of the 95 passengers were injured.
   During the next two years, FlightSafety workers will remove
every piece from the cockpit and refurbish it. Using the aluminum
structure as a mold, workers will construct a fiberglass shell that
will eventually be the simulator.

<HEAD>Homeless Panelists Wanted Stronger Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report that termed homelessness a ``national
disgrace'' was watered down and should have contained even stronger
language and more specific recommendations, say members of the
group that worked on the study for the National Academy of Sciences.
   Bruce C. Vladeck, president of the United Hospital Fund of New
York and head of the 13-member committee that prepared the study,
said the academy refused to include a strong supplemental statement.
   ``The report, as it now stands, basically, was rejected by a
majority of the committee because they felt it was not strong
enough,'' Vladeck said.
   The edited final report ``did not allow us to express our
outrage, our anger and our dismay at what we studied,'' complained
Phyllis Wolfe, a panel member and the head of Health Care for the
Homeless, Inc., in Washington.
   ``Those who served on the panel ... were a little disturbed that
we were not able to go into more detail on the problems of the
homeless and some of the corrective measures that should be
taken,'' added Nathan Stark, a Washington lawyer and panel member
who joined in signing a six-page supplemental statement issued by
Vladeck's office in New York.
   Despite the complaints, Vladeck raised the prospect that the
material in the supplemental statement actually generated more
attention by being left out of the official report than if it had
been included.
   Faced with a choice of leaving out their strongest comments and
issuing no report at all, the majority chose to permit the Academy
to issue the bulk of the study and then make public their
supplement independently, he explained.
   ``And frankly,'' he added, ``I think we wound up getting more
publicity than we would have if it was buried in the report.''
   The supplemental statement called for a restoration of federal
support for low-income housing to 1981 levels, criticising the
sharp cuts in these programs in recent years.
   It also urged a minimum wage at a level which would make decent
housing possible in most cities and called for the federal
government to be the guarantor of last resort in health care.
   ``The way you do away with homelessness is to provide homes,''
commented Stark, a former undersecretary at the Department of
Health and Human Services.
   The panelists were ``concerned that not enough emphasis was put
on the plight of homelessness, in terms of just a statistical
study,'' Stark said.
   ``I think the Academy is right in one sense,'' he added. ``They
want all their reports to be as scientific and objective as
possible.''
   But, he said, once he had visited shelters and met the homeless
and people who work with them, he realized that more was needed in
this report.
   The group ``felt that the tone was important, as well as the
substance, and this was not an issue where one can be comfortable
being as bland as such reports tend to be,'' said Vladeck.
   Dr. Frank Press, former science adviser to President Carter and
head of the independent Academy of Sciences since 1981, was quoted
in The New York Times as saying the supplementary statement had
been rejected because it was ``polemical and emotional.''
   Press' office said he was not available Tuesday and referred
calls to the Academy's Institute of Medicine, which organized the
study as requested by Congress.
   At that Institute, Dr. Fred Solomon termed the official report
``strong,'' but said some of the specific recommendations were
``not sufficiently scholarly and documented to be included.''
   The panel members ``were appalled at what they saw'' in their
research, Solomon said.
   He said academy reviewers agreed with many of the panel's
opinions, but felt they needed more detailed economic analyses
before they could be published officially.
   ``The committee members endorsed the (official) report, and were
at liberty to release their own statement elsewhere, which they
have just done,'' he added.
   The official 242-page report portrays a homeless population not
only of alcoholics and former mental patients, but one with growing
numbers of children and families scraping out a dismal existence in
rural communities.
   It calls children under 18 the fastest growing group among the
nation's homeless and says this is ``nothing short of a national
disgrace that must be treated with the urgency that such a
situation demands.''

<BYLINE>Endangered Squirrel On National Forest Land Targeted For Ski Resort
^By PAIGE St. JOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An endangered species of flying
squirrels and a virgin stand of red spruce are in the way of a
developer's plan to turn a section of national forest into a $100
million ski resort.
   Environmentalists are mounting forces to oppose a proposal by
Laurel Creek Development Corp. to build a resort community on the
north slope of Big Spruce Mountain, which overlooks the Cranberry
Wilderness Area in eastern West Virginia.
   The developer is negotiating with the U.S. Forest Service to
swap another piece of forestland for the Big Spruce land.
   ``We're concerned about the precedent here, of swapping really
pristine land at the call of an out-of-state developer,'' said Mary
Wimmer, conservation chairwoman for the West Virginia Sierra Club.
   Laurel Creek officials joined with Gov. Arch Moore last week to
announce the development, which has sold 100 club memberships
already, starting at $15,000 each. The governor claimed Laurel
Creek could create as many as 2,300 jobs in four years, counting
spin-off services. Building lots will cost between $100,000 and
$500,000, Moore said.
   But Laurel Creek does not yet own the heart of its project _ the
top of the mountain, which has an elevation of 4,695 feet. Without
it, officials said Monday, the resort would have no long ski runs.
   Joined with 1,000 to 2,000 acres of land Laurel Creek already
owns, the company would create a 2,300-acre complex with two golf
courses, 32 ski runs, seven restaurants, lodges, cabins and houses.
   The mountaintop is a scarce habitat for the Northern Virginia
flying squirrel, which lives in only a few areas of the state.
   The rust-colored, palm-sized animals roam the woods at night,
gliding among the tree tops. The flying squirrels have disappeared
over most of their U.S. range for unknown reasons, but
environmentalists blame the decline on a loss of habitat.
   The squirrels like mature red spruce stands, which are
experiencing problems in the region.
   ``The spruce decline along the whole Appalachian corridor is
very serious. It is becoming very scarce,'' Wimmer said. ``These
areas need to be set aside.''
   She said she also is waiting for the Forest Service to check the
mountain for other endangered species, including the Cheat Mountain
salamander, which lives in red spruce forests.
   Local trout fishermen also are concerned the resort would
pollute Day Run, a trout stream, and in turn hurt the Williams
River and the Cranberry River, which flows through
nationally-protected wilderness areas.
   And conservationalists have another problem _ the way the matter
has been handled.
   While the development was announced publicly last week, it was
revealed that the corporation began talking privately with the
Forest Service a year ago a land swap.
   ``We feel there's been way too much work done without local
input on this,'' Wimmer said.
   Richard Trochlil of the Forest Service office in Elkins said
Laurel Creek had made no firm trade offers. To be acceptable, the
land must match Big Spruce's stands of red spruce, he said.
   He said there was no available figure on how much of the
mountain would be cut for ski slopes.
   He said the mountain is not a wilderness area, and that three to
four Forest Service-supervised logging operations already are
cutting trees in the national forest.
   Laurel Creek officials did not return repeated telephone
messages left this week.

<HEAD>Mother, Daughter Plead Innocent To Hiring Hit Man To Kill Husbands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman and her daughter pleaded innocent to
charges they tried to hire a hit man to kill their ex-husbands in
alleged schemes that prosecutors say each woman undertook without
the other's knowledge.
   Municipal Court Judge Nicholas Kasimatas set bail at $50,000 for
Judith Lynette East, 45, of Paradise Hills, and at $30,000 for her
daughter, Venise Lynette Morris, 27, of La Mesa.
   ``They apparently were not working together in the solicitation
for murder,'' Deputy District Attorney Robert Eichler said.
   Police say criminal-intelligence unit investigators heard that
each woman was looking for a hit man, so an undercover officer
telephoned each separately.
   East allegedly offered the officer $10,000 to kill her husband,
saying she would pay for it from his insurance policy, worth about
$100,000, Eichler said. Morris gave the officer a $1,000 personal
check as a down payment on a $5,000 fee to kill her ex-husband, he
said.
   ``Miss Morris' ex-husband was accused of molesting her young
daughter, which was the alleged motive in that case. It's very
clear ... that both defendants together fabricated evidence in that
(alleged molestation) case,'' Eichler said.
   The solicitation charge carries a maximum prison term of six
years, while a conspiracy charge could mean life in prison.
Kasimatis scheduled a preliminary hearing Oct. 3.

   A grand jury will investigate police
procedures at a demonstration that led to the serious injury of a
United Farm Workers leader, the district attorney said.
   Arlo Smith asked the panel foreman to investigate whether
criminal charges should be filed as ``the best way to clear up any
questions.''
   Dolores Huerta suffered a ruptuwo broken ribs in
the demonstration last week, in which police shoved protesters from
the front of a hotel.
   Demonstrators were protesting the presence of Republican
presidential candidate George Bush, who opposes the union's table
grapes boycott.red spleen and t
   Police, the city Office of Citizen's Complaints and the union
are conducting independent investigations.
   Also on Monday, about 100 people attended an interfairth prayer
session for Huerta outside San Francsico General Hospital, where
the 58-year-old co-founder of the UFW remained in stable condition.
   Huerta probably would go home Tuesday, nursing Supervisor
Dorothy Washington said.
   Police Chief Frank Jordan said the department was reviewing its
methods, but said police are taught in accordance with methods
approved by the state.
   Neither police nor television tapes appear to show Huerta being
hit.

   Four police officers were fired
after supervisors overheard them broadcasting vulgar conversations
over citizens band radios while on duty, police say.
   Using portable CBs they plugged into their cruisers, the
officers used derogatory sexual language to describe a female
sergeant, used racial slurs and talked about hiding their cars
rather than patrolling, police said.
   ``After you get past some of the offensiveness and the disgust,
their behavior shows there is a total immaturity of these
officers,'' Police Chief Joe Gerwens said Monday. ``These are the
people we entrust with the safety of the community.''
   The Fraternal Order of Police will appeal the dismissals, said
Frank DeRusso, president of the Fort Lauderdale chapter. He said
the officers' conversations were private, and defended the content,
saying they were venting job frustrations.
   The men, who make at least $34,000 annually, are suspended
without pay until Oct. 13, when their dismissals become effective.

   Potholes won't be filled and parks won't get
money they expected for the rest of 1988 as New Orleans works to
eliminate a $19 million deficit.
   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy on Monday released a list of $6.9
million in planned cuts.
   Barthelemy is pushing a $125 flat fee to be charged on each
piece of property and a hiring freeze to eliminate the rest of the
deficit. Business leaders opppose the service charge, which would
raise $10 million.
   Criminal Sheriff Charles Foti's office and the police department
will lose $500,000 each.
   The sheriff said he could not discuss the cut in detail. Most of
the police cut will be from car maintenance, Assistant Chief
Administrative Officer Leonard Simmons said.
   A $460,000 cut to the Streets Department came with an order that
potholes be filled only in emergencies.
   City and Audubon parks and the New Orleans Museum of Art are
losing their fourth-quarter appropriations from the city _ $37,500
for City Park and $75,000 each for Audubon Park and the museum.

   Three members of a polygamist clan were
arraigned today on second-degree murder charges in the slaying of a
state corrections officer during a police confrontation with the
family.
   It was the first appearance in state court of the three
defendants, who with the clan's matriarch were convicted in May of
20 of 23 federal counts stemming from the Jan. 16 bombing of a
Mormon chapel and subsequent standoff.
   Monday night, police arrested a man in a suspected arson attempt
at the same chapel, in Kamas.
   Summit County Attorney Robert Adkins said an alarm inside the
church went off, alerting sheriff's officers to a break-in. Asked
if the case was a possible attempted arson, he said, ``There is
some evidence there that would indicate that.''
   Adkins and Sheriff Fred Eley declined to identify the arrested
man or provide other details.
   Clan leader Addam Swapp, his brother Jonathan Swapp, and John
Timothy Singer appeared before 3rd Circuit Judge Maurice Jones
today, who set a tentative preliminary hearing date of Sept. 27.
   Utah Corrections Lt. Fred House was shot to death when a gun
battle ended the 13-day siege Jan. 28.
   The manacled defendants, brought from the Salt Lake County Jail
where they have been held without bail since their arrests in
January, were asked if they would agree to a prosecution motion
that their preliminary hearing be held in a Salt Lake City
courtroom.
   Attorneys for Addam Swapp and Singer agreed, while the attorney
for Jonathan Swapp said he would discuss the matter with his client.
   The three defendants and matriarch Vickie Singer all received
minimum federal sentences earlier this month from U.S. District
Judge Bruce Jenkins, who said his hands were tied by federal
statutes requiring minimum mandatory terms for the use of bombs or
firearms in crimes.
   Addam Swapp, 27, received the stiffest sentence, 15 years in
prison, while Mrs. Singer, 45, was given five years. Jonathan
Swapp, 21, and John Timothy Singer, 22, both were sentenced to 10
years.
   John Timothy Singer, whom prosecutors have named as the
triggerman in House's death, said during his federal sentencing
that he was trying to defend the Swapp brothers when he fired the
shot believed to have killed the lawman.
   House, a canine officer, had been ordering police dogs to subdue
the Swapp brothers when he was killed.

   The United States next month will destroy the
first of the ground-launched cruise missiles it agreed to eliminate
under the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, the
Pentagon announced Tuesday.
   Forty-one cruise missiles and canisters and seven launchers are
to be destroyed on Oct. 18-19 at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near
Tucson, Ariz., the Defense Department said.
   On Sept. 8, as Vice President George Bush and Soviet observers
watched, U.S. officials burned off two Pershing rocket motors at
the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in Karnack, Texas, the first two
of the 867 U.S. missiles to be destroyed under the pact. The treaty
was signed last December in Washington.
   Under the treaty, Soviet officials are entitled to send up to 20
observers to watch the destruction in Arizona, according to
Pentagon officials.
   As of Aug. 30, the Soviet Union had destroyed 22 medium- and 50
shorter-range missiles. It must destroy a total of 1,752 SS-4,
SS-12 and SS-20 missiles under the treaty.

<HEAD>West Germany Building On Decades Of Good Ties With Iran</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Building on decades of good ties
with Iran, West Germany is seeking a greater business and
diplomatic role in the country now that a cease-fire has been
declared in the Iran-Iraq war.
   West German optimism toward Iran _ which sends its students to
be educated in Germany and buys more goods from this country than
any other _ grew after the recent release of West German hostage
Rudolf Cordes from his pro-Iranian Lebanese kidnappers on Sept. 12.
   
   Germans have long felt what one expert calls a ``post-Romantic
interest'' in Iran. A sector of the West German popular press
provides constant coverage of the doings of Soraya Bakhtiary, once
married to the shah of Iran.
   Unlike the United States and other countries that broke off or
curtailed ties with Iran after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini came to
power in 1979, West Germany kept its relations active.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher credited those contacts
with success in gaining the release of Cordes and promised to use
that goodwill to try to win freedom for other Western hostages in
Lebanon held by pro-Iranian kidnappers.
   ``Since the time of the German kaisers at the end of the 19th
century, there have been good relations, politically, economically
and culturally (with Iran),'' said Dieter Vogel, the Economics
Ministry spokesman in Bonn.
   Less than two days after Cordes' release, the Economics Ministry
announced that its No. 2 official, Dieter von Wuerzen, was heading
to Tehran for a four-day visit to explore further business
possibilities.
   ``But the announcement was just a coincidence,'' Vogel said in
an interview with The Associated Press, adding that the trip had
been planned in advance.
   ``West German companies have a good chance of taking part in
construction and reconstruction projects after the war with Iraq,''
Vogel said.
   The Welt Am Sonntag newspaper cited the Middle East Economic
Survey as saying reconstruction contracts for Iran could total $50
billion.
   ``When the weapons in the Persian Gulf went silent, German
businessmen began to make their calculations,'' the newspaper added.
   Vogel cautioned that Iran's hard currency shortage would make
foreign payments difficult.
   He said West Germans respect Iranians as trading partners _
despite the country's radical and sometimes fanatic image.
   Despite a trading decline due to the Iran-Iraq war, Iran
continues to import more goods from West Germany than from any
other country, according to the West German Economics Ministry.
   In 1987, West Germany sold $1.5 billion of goods to Iran,
including motor vehicles, heavy machinery and electronic products.
West Germany also imported $500 million worth of goods from Iran.
   While West German law strictly forbids the shipment of weapons
to areas of conflict, there are occasional reports of such material
reaching Iran.
   In May 1987, the Hamburg-based Der Spiegel magazine said a
government-owned factory near Wiesbaden was exporting machines used
for making ammunition to Iran and Iraq.
   A book published in July alleged that Frankfurt airport had
become a transfer hub for shipment of weapons to the Persian Gulf,
including Iran. Airport officials quickly denied the allegations,
which were in a book written by West German journalist Juergen Roth.

   An improving trade deficit helped economic
growth remain strong in the second quarter despite the Farm Belt
drought, but inflation was more severe than previously believed,
the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of the nation's $4 trillion economy, grew at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.0 percent in the April-June
period. That was slower than the 3.4 percent expansion rate in the
first quarter, but still brisk.
   If not for the drought, second-quarter growth would have been a
more robust 3.9 percent. Crop and livestock losses for the year are
estimated at $13.9 billion and will be even more of a drag on the
economy in the third and fourth quarters.
   The government said accelerating inflation accompanied the
strong growth. One price measure tied to the GNP rose at the
fastest pace in nearly six years and was more than triple the
first-quarter rate.
   ``However you measure inflation, we got more of it than we
thought in the second quarter and that's bad news for the financial
markets,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &
Co., a government securities dealer in New York.
   Reacting to the report, the bond market opened weak in light
trading.
   The GNP deflator, which reflects changes in buying patterns as
well as prices, rose at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the second
quarter, compared with 1.7 percent in the first quarter. It was the
biggest jump since the third quarter of 1982.
   The second-quarter deflator had been estimated a month earlier
at a somewhat more moderate 5.1 percent. Also, the previous report
had showed stronger second-quarter growth, 3.3 percent instead of
3.0 percent.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called Tuesday's
report good news. ``The facts, plus the moderating growth rate,
point to inflation remaining under control,'' he said.
   Jones said the acceleration in inflation after nearly six years
of economic growth is, while troublesome, more moderate than in
previous expansions.
   ``All in all we're going to sail into the election in pretty
good shape,'' he said. ``The general thrust of the economy, I would
think, favors the Republicans. Growth is strong, but not too
strong. There's some inflation, but not as much as there could be.''
   The Federal Reserve Board, concerned with signs of overheating
in the economy, began an inflation-fighting program in late March
by pushing up short-term interest rates. Its goal is to curb demand
and slow economic growth to a level that can be maintained without
significant inflation.
   Analysts differ over whether the economy in the quarter ending
this month is responding. Some, pointing to an upturn in
unemployment and a slight drop in retail sales last month, say
growth is moderating. Others see the August figures as more of a
pause than a trend.
   Michael K. Evans, head of a private forecasting firm in
Washington, said higher interest rates are helping to curb spending
by consumers who have adjustable rate mortgages and other
fluctuating loans.
   Meanwhile, he said, growth in exports is slowing from
unsustainably high levels and by next year will be hurt by the
partial recovery in the value of the dollar this year.
   ``I think we can pretty much say the export boom is coming to an
end,'' he said.
   However, Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New
York, said investment spending and exports will remain strong,
while consumer spending will remain about the same.
   ``Any actual moderation is still in the future,'' he said.
   The government attributed its downward revision in the
second-quarter growth to slightly less expansion than first
believed in exports and business investment.
   Exports of goods and services expanded at a 9.1 percent annual
rate, compared with the previous estimate of 11.6 percent.
   Business investment spending shot up 15.0 percent, compared with
last month's estimate of 16.3 percent.
   However, consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of
all economic activity, was up 3.0 percent at an annual rate,
compared with the slightly weaker 2.7 percent previously announced.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
at an annual level of $3.99 trillion in the second quarter, $29.1
billion higher than the January-March period.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said that after-tax
profits by corporations surged 8.9 percent in the second quarter to
an annual rate of $162.7 billion, up from a 2.5 percent annual rate
in the first quarter. It was the most profitable quarter since the
July-September period of 1983.

<TEXT>
   A church will no longer allow a group of
American Indians to use its property for a powwow because the
pastor says the event unleashes ``spiritual forces that are
anti-Christ.''
   In a letter to the powwow organizers, David R. Powell, pastor of
the Evangel Assembly of God, wrote, ``We believe that there is a
polarity of spiritual belief between us that is irreconcilable.''
   The group had held the powwow at the church for the last two
years.
   The letter said the church believes it ``permitted some
spiritual forces that are anti-Christ and anti-Yahweh to operate on
our facility during the days of the powwow.'' The letter was not
more specific.
   A secretary at the Evangel Assembly of God said Tuesday the
pastor would not comment further.
   The church's decision had ``nothing to do with you as a nation
or race of people or a reflection of your personal or corporate
conduct or courtesy,'' Powell told the American Indians.
   Powwow organizers said they were puzzled and saddened.
   ``It's a complete misunderstanding of our culture,'' said Jim
Roaix Sr., of Naugatuck, editor of The Eagle, an Indian-affairs
newspaper published by Eagle Wing Press. Eagle Wing is a co-sponsor
of the powwow.
   More than 95 percent of American Indians are Christians, Roaix
said.
   ``I find it sad that in the 20th century there are religious
groups still operating on an 18th-century type of attitude,'' said
Patricia Benedict, executive director of American Indians for
Development of Meriden, the other sponsor.
   ``Powwows are basically social events,'' Benedict said.
   Karen Cooper, editorial writer at The Eagle, said Tuesday the
powwow also educated people about the Indian culture. ``It's like
going to a fair,'' she said.
   The festival, to be held this weekend, has been moved to Black
Rock State Park. It will include American Indian arts and crafts,
singers and dancers, a replica of New England bark-covered wigwam,
storytelling and cooking demonstrations.
   Last year's event drew more than 3,000 visitors, with the church
receiving a share of the proceeds, Roaix said.

<TEXT>
   A landlord convicted of multiple
housing violations strapped on an electronic ankle bracelet and
began a sentence of house arrest in an apartment without hot water,
refrigerator, stove or air conditioning.
   George C. Fogarty began serving the 30-day sentence Monday,
forced to stay in the apartment from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. Monday
through Saturday and all day Sunday. His ankle bracelet triggers a
police alarm if he attempts to leave at the wrong times.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, if he has a toilet, he's lucky,''
said Broward County Court Judge June Johnson, who sentenced Fogarty
after he pleaded guilty in August to at least 40 housing code
violations. ``I visited apartments there where some people had
holes in the floor for a bathroom.''
   The charges against Fogarty included claims that raw sewage
spilled out on tenants' floors and that apartments were infested
with rats and roaches. The judge also ordered him to pay a $5,000
fine and placed him on probation for one year.
   Fogarty no longer owns the property that he is staying in for
the month. The new owners agreed to rent him an apartment.
   Fogarty, 36, said he was being made a scapegoat and that the
apartment he was sentenced to was in worse condition than when he
rented it out. ``I'm so mad,'' he said. ``I need a punching bag to
take out my frustrations.''
   But city prosecutor Scott Walker said, ``Fogarty has fought us
all along. He has never showed a willingness to comply with the
building codes. He is an excuse-giver.''
   If Fogarty violates his house arrest, he could be sentenced to
up to 11 years in prison.

<TEXT>
   Carcasses of 73 wild horses have been
discovered in an isolated section of central Nevada and authorities
believe they were gunned down, a Bureau of Land Management
spokesman said Tuesday.
   Federal investigators were tipped by a person who was questioned
about an earlier rifle slaughter of 44 horses. The two sites are 30
miles apart.
   Bob Stewart, bureau spokesman, said a helicopter crew Monday
identified 73 piles of bones and other evidence.
   The spokesman said ground crews were headed into the remote area
to verify the cause of death of the horses but the evidence so far
``leads us to believe they were shot.''
   He said the carcasses and bones of the horses were strewn along
an area one to two miles wide and about eight miles long,
apparently gunned down over a six-month period starting about one
year ago.
   Stewart said the person who led investigators to the grisly
discovery isn't being identified. He also declined to comment on
whether there are any firm leads in either of the horse slaughters.
   He said local authorities, the U.S. attorney and the FBI have
been notified about the latest case, and land management employees
have been told to ``increase their looking and try to spot any
similar tragedies.''
   Stewart said the carcasses weren't spotted immediately because
crews who fly the area making horse counts ``fly at higher
elevations and watch for dust clouds and movement.''
   He said the maximum penalty for shooting a wild horse is a fine
of $2,000 and a year in prison for each killing.
   More than 38,000 wild horses now run the open range of 10
western states, up from about 17,000 when Congress in 1971 made it
a crime to harrass or kill wild horses on public lands. Nevada has
up to 28,000 wild horses, according to estimates.
   At the turn of the century there were some 2 million wild horses
in the West, but they were relentlessly hunted by cowboys and
``mustangers'' in trucks and airplanes. The animals were
slaughtered for pet food and glue.

<TEXT>
   Dozens of people were snookered by a bogus
classified ad and showed up at a pier Tuesday for a non-existent
automobile auction of 600 cars, ``Audis to Mercedes,'' for $50 to
$700.
   ``The situation is frought with humor and everybody was joking
about it,'' said Victor Ross, spokesman for the City Department of
Transportation, the agency responsible for disposing of towed and
confiscated vehicles that are not claimed.
   By noon, nearly 70 people had arrived at the pier, ``including a
couple from Philadelphia, clutching about $5,000 in their fists,''
Ross said. ``They figured they could pick up five Audis at a $1,000
each, sell them at $2,000 and double their money. I don't know how
they planned to drive five cars back.''
   The ad, which appeared in The New York Times classified section
Monday, said a ``once-a-year liquidation'' auction would be held
Tuesday at Pier 76 in Manhattan by the ``New York City Parking
Authority.''
   There is no such authority. And while Pier 76 is where impounded
and confiscated cars are stored, auctions are held every Friday at
Pier 24. There is no annual clearance sale.
   Ross said about 400 cars are auctioned by the city each month,
either cars that have been towed away because the motorist
disobeyed parking regulations, or cars confiscated from scofflaws.
   The ad was placed by someone claiming to be Neil Rosen of the
Department of Transportation, who ordered the $403.90 bill sent to
the department.
   ``With the millions of ads that we run, this occasionally
happens,'' said Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen. ``We'll do
everything we can to straighten this out with the city.''

<HEAD>School Board Appeals Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Don't start up the band just yet. The
Purdy School Board says it will appeal a judge's order that it
allow school-sponsored dancing.
   The school board also has asked that the judge stay his order
pending their appeal.
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ruled Aug. 1 that Purdy High
School's century-old dance ban was unconstitutional because it
promoted the values of those who oppose dancing for religious
reasons.
   Clark later awarded the 21 Purdy students and their parents who
began lobbying for a dance two years ago $1 in damages _ all they
requested _ and nearly $80,000 in attorney fees.
   But school board officials, in announcing late Monday that they
would appeal, insisted the ban was not religiously grounded.
   In a statement, Schools Superintendent Sheldon Buxton cited
concerns about policing and paying for school-sponsored dancing
that board members say led them to support the ban.
   William Fleischaker, the Joplin attorney who represented the
pro-dancers, said Tuesday that he would advise the students to
contine with plans for a dance by asking the school board's
permission to hold on.
   ``I expect that we will have a formal request here fairly
quickly,'' Fleischaker said.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor whose boss complained
her short skirts made her look like a man-hunting ``bimbo'' has
been fired after lodging a complaint against him with the county
human rights commission.
   Brenda Taylor, a Broward County assistant state attorney, had
refused to trade her designer blouses and tight-fitting skirts for
more conservative atire despite memos from her supervisor, John
Countryman.
   ``I'm a little embarrassed for the state attorney's office,''
Ms. Taylor's attorney, Harris Lowenthal, said after Monday's
firing. ``I think they've stepped into a hole and now they're
digging it deeper.''
   Ms. Taylor on Monday received a dismissal letter charging she
had mishandled drunken-driving cases, was frequently absent or
tardy from court, and failed to complete paperwork.
   ``This is garbage,'' said Ms. Taylor, 25. ``It just shows to
what lengths they will go to get someone. I've never been a
crusader before, but it was my neck on the line and I had to do
something.''
   Ms. Taylor said her firing came in direct response to the
complaint she filed against Countryman last month, charging him
with discriminating against her. No hearing date was set.
   Countryman's problems with Ms. Taylor were spelled out in five
memos and in Monday's termination letter.
   ``I told her that ts the Republican to soften his stance once the
election is over.
   ``I would hope after Nov. 8 he would take a closer look,''
Strauss said. ``Certainly (former Treasury Secretary James) Baker,
one of his principal economic advisers, knows we have to so
something about the deficit.''
   Strauss, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee
and former U.S. trade representative who has gained a reputation as
a skilled negotiator, called the National Economic Commission the
toughest job he has ever faced. He put the chance of success at
about 70 percent.
   Strauss told reporters after his appearance that the commission
is examining the possibility of separating the Social Security
funds from general revenues after the budget is balanced. Critics
have charged that it is wrong to use current surpluses in Social
Security to lower the overall budget deficit since that means the
money will not be earmarked specifically for retirement benefits
when Baby Boomers begin retiring in the early part of the next
century.
   Stauss said the panel is examining boosting taxes on cigarettes
and alcohol and other consumption taxes as preferable to raising
individual income tax rates.
   Strauss said the panel probably will make some recommendations
on reforming the budget process, examining such issues as whether a
two-year budget would improve Congress' ability to meet deadlines
and whether a line-item veto or a constitutional amendment to
balance the budget should be adopted.
   The 12-member commission, appointed by President Reagan and
congressional leaders, is split evenly between Democrats and
Republicans. Other members include Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
Iacocca, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, and former Defense
Secretary Casper Weinberger.

   On Jan. 1, singer-dancer-actor Ben
Vereen was co-host of a New Year's Day television show.
   Off camera, he had turned to alchohol and drugs in an attempt to
dull the pain of losing a daughter killed in an auto accident just
weeks before. By New Year's Day, Vereen was considering suicide.
   ``On New Year's Eve, I was wishing the world a happy New Year's

daughter, Naja, was killed in an auto accident weeks before.
   He said in a recent interview that he found help from a friend,
writer-producer Stephen J. Cannell, who had lost a son a few years
earlier. Cannell had him re-create the role of Tenspeed Turner from
Vereen's 1980 television series ``Tenspeed and Brownshoe,'' on
NBC-TV's ``J.J. Starbuck.''
   ``He gave me work when I really needed it,'' Vereen said.
``Everyone on `J.J. Starbuck' helped me to survive.''
   Vereen also checked into a drug rehabilitation center.
   He's working to turn the New York City house he grew up in into

   Actor Scott Baio has been sued by a Union City
entertainment company, which contends he misrepresented his
box-office clout and refused to live up to an agreement for a movie.
   Seals Communications Corp., which says Baio's actions caused it
to be unable to obtain financing for the movie, is seeking $2.6
million from Baio, who starred in the television series ``Charles
in Charge.''
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, says Seals
hired Baio to star in ``The Stand Out'' mainly because of the
exposure he said he would receive in another movie, which never was
released.
   Seals paid Baio advances totaling $35,000, and the actor was to
begin physical training and developing a Georgia accent for his
role as a college football player, according to the suit.
   Baio later decided he wanted to play a different role in the
film, the suit said, and he agreed to assist in the development of
the script and to learn about motorcycle racing to prepare for that
role.
   Baio, the suit charges, ``failed and refused to perform pursuant
to the agreements.''
   Baio then agreed to do a national radio and television campaign
for safe sex, a project which violated the agreement with Seals,
according to the suit.
   David Aufdenspring, the Atlanta attorney representing Baio, was
out of his office Tuesday and could not be reached for comment.

   Charles Webb, author of ``The Graduate,''
says he and his ex-wife Fred had no idea nudism would so distress
the woman who had opened her house to them, but now they're
home-hunting again.
   Marcelle Hall recently invited the couple to stay in her home
after reading they had little money and no permanent place to live.
   ``It's not fair to say she threw us out,'' Webb said. ``There
was just a difference of opinion on the nudism. She got really
upset. We didn't realize nudism was such an upsetting thing,
compared to other things that go on in the world.''
   The couple said they moved into a $43-a-night motel in Danbury
on Saturday. Destitute by choice after giving away most of their
property, they have only $150 left, they said.
   ``We've got another two nights at the most,'' he said. ``We're
just sort of stunned at this point. She was generous to invite us
into her home. But there were so many things (they disagreed
about). We just feel sort of rocked.''
   Webb is waiting for a call from a lawyer to give him the
go-ahead to write a sequel to ``The Graduate,'' which became the
hit movie that propelled Dustin Hoffman to stardom.

<HEAD>Council Bans Videotape After Black Leaders' Complaints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council banned use of a police
videotape on drug-trafficking gangs after black leaders complained
a profile of gang members promoted racist stereotypes.
   The council on Monday also agreed to establish a task force to
plan with police strategies for keeping gangs out of Spokane, and
unanimously approved a resolution condemning a recent series of
racially motivated assaults and vandalism.
   Police Chief Terry Mangan, who had been ordered by City Manager
Terry Novak to stay away from the meeting to avoid confrontations,
defended the videotape.
   ``We support the task force's efforts, and hope it will be
successful,'' Mangan said. ``I just hope this delay, this possible
change of direction, does not work to the advantage of drug gangs.
That would be a real tragedy.''
   A group of black leaders said the videotape, which depicts gang
activity in other cities, unfairly blames black youths for the drug
problem and has caused a backlash by police and racist groups.
   The tape had been shown to school and civic groups and on a city
cable television station.
   ``It is one of the most racist pieces of propaganda I have ever
seen,'' said Jerry Harvey, a Spokane School District employee. ``If
there had been proper input and consultation, this tape would have
never gone out.''
   ``The bad guys come in all colors and wear all kinds of hats,''
said Carl Boston, president of the Spokane Chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Police have repeatedly stopped black youths for minor offenses,
sometimes with guns drawn, the black leaders complained.
   ``We think it's undue harassment,'' said the Rev. Ezra Kinlow.
``The police department is there to protect us, but we do feel they
are overreacting.''
   Mangan said the videotape was prepared mostly from network
documentaries and ``based on the best advice we were able to obtain
from a number of cities which have gone through what we are just
starting to go through.''
   The task force will be comprised of five black people chosen by
Mayor Vicki McNeill, two members of the Interstate Task Force on
Human Relations, and council members Sheri Barnard and Joel Crosby.

   President Reagan probably will not hold a
formal news conference before the Nov. 8 election but ``very
likely'' will have one after his successor is chosen, a White House
spokesman said Tuesday.
   Marlin Fitzwater did not say why it is doubtful Reagan will have
a news conference before Election Day.
   Reagan has committed himself to an ambitious schedule of
out-of-town trips on behalf of Republican presidential nominee
George Bush and GOP congressional candidates.
   Asked at his daily news briefing when Reagan will hold a formal
news conference, Fitzwater said, ``We do not anticipate one before
the election.''
   Asked whether one is likely after Nov. 8, he said, ``Very
likely.''
   The president's last news conference was at the seven-nation
economic summit in Toronto on June 21.
   Fitzwater said that an article written by Reagan will appear in
a forthcoming issue of International Affairs Magazine, published by
the Soviet Foreign Ministry, and he said it was likely Reagan would
be granting individual interviews to various news organizations in
the coming months.
   The spokesman said Reagan presented the article to Boris
Piadyshev, spokeman for the Foreign Minister, when Piadyshev
visited him in the Oval Office on Monday.
   Fitzwater said the issue of the magazine will be published on
Nov. 1. He said the subject of the president's article would be
``peace, freedom and world affairs.''

   Marilyn Quayle on Tuesday characterized as
``totally insulting'' speculation that Republican nominee George
Bush selected her husband as his running mate because Dan Quayle's
good looks might attract female voters.
   ``George Bush wouldn't have selected someone who could not stand
in his stead for president,'' she told reporters during her first
solo campaign tour.
   Mrs. Quayle said her husband has established a reputation as an
expert on defense and arms control issues as a 12-year Senate
veteran, and has met with many foreign leaders.
   ``The women of Indiana have elected him, and it's certainly not
because of his looks,'' she said.
   During a series of brief interviews with local television
reporters, Mrs. Quayle blamed the media for the controversy
surrounding the GOP vice presidential candidate's academic
performance and military service.
   ``He's never been a person who kowtowed to the media, stroked
them, had them in our home,'' she said. ``The Washington media
elite didn't know him and they were struck off guard.''
   In an earlier interview with ABC-TV's Barbara Walters, Mrs.
Quayle said the media is overwhelmingly liberal and was pursuing
her husband because he is conservative.
   Mrs. Quayle, who met her husband in 1972 when both were
attending night classes at Indiana University Law School, is
considered one of the stronger assets of her husband's campaign and
his most trusted adviser.
   A senior campaign official said that in recognition of her
campaign skills, she has been asked to travel independently on
behalf of the GOP ticket. She will join the Indiana senator for one
or two days each week.
   Mrs. Quayle, 39,is a practiced campaigner who often pulls her
husband away from reporters when he begins to respond to impromptu
questions and tends to make misstatements or garble his words.
   She insists she is ``not trying to protect him'' but is
reminding him to cut his conversation short and keep up with his
campaign schedule.
   Quayle, 41, told one news conferent that his wife ``is my best
adviser, my strongest supporter, the person that I love more than
anybody else in this world.'' He called her ``a very strong,
independent-minded woman'' with whom he has a very close
relationship.
   They have three children, Tucker, 14; Benjamin, 11, and Corinne,
9.

<HEAD>Prospect Of Being First Jewish First Lady Not Lost on Kitty
Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Never one to mince words, Kitty Dukakis
has been particularly outspoken at times when questioned about her
Jewish faith or world events affecting the Jewish state of Israel.
   She was quick to express her outrage when Pope John Paul II
embraced Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, who was accused of
complicity in Nazi war crimes.
   On the other hand, she hasn't been afraid to criticize Israeli
efforts to force Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel instead of the
United States.
   Most recently, she spoke forcefully when asked about the
resignations of a handful of volunteers and a ranking George Bush
adviser who were mentioned in allegations of anti-Jewish
activities. One volunteer who resigned had praised a researcher who
has denied the existence of the Holocaust during World War II.
   ``For anyone to suggest the Holocaust was a hoax is very
painful,'' Mrs. Dukakis said. ``Six million Jews and millions of
others lost their lives. ... One has to wonder why these people
were attracted and recruited to the campaign of my husband's
opponent.''
   The prospect of being the nation's first Jewish first lady is
not lost on Katharine Dickson Dukakis, the wife of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   She returned to Brookline on Tuesday afternoon from a trip to
Rhode Island so she could spend the holiest of Jewish holidays, Yom
Kippur, at home. She was attending Temple Israel in Brookline
Tuesday night before returning home for the traditional fast.
   She has been an active and aggressive campaigner for her husband
and referred to her faith frequently during appearances before the
primary in New York, where Jews are an important voting bloc. She
traces her vigorous lobbying on behalf of refugees from around the
world to the lessons of the Holocaust.
   ``I feel a great deal of pride in my ethnic and religious
background,'' Mrs. Dukakis, leaning back in her chair and breaking
into a broad smile, said in a recent interview at her home.
   She said at the outset of the campaign she feared she would
encounter anti-Semitism but has said since that that hasn't
happened. But both she and her Greek Orthodox husband have been
criticized by conservatives for their interfaith marriage.
   James Jatras, an aide to Sen. William L. Armstrong, R-Colo.,
circulated a letter in May denouncing Dukakis for his marriage to a
``non-Christian'' and said Dukakis was therefore not a Christian in
good standing. Mrs. Dukakis also was targeted by a conservative
columnist who questioned her commitment to Judaism by citing her
marriage to a non-Jew.
   The Dukakises have said little about either incident, choosing
to ignore instead of publicize them. Their children, John, born
during Mrs. Dukakis' first marriage, and daughters Andrea and Kara,
observe the holidays of both the Jewish and Greek Orthodox faiths
with their parents.
   But in other public statements, Mrs. Dukakis has said she is
``fiercely proud'' of her faith and also has promised to host a
Passover Seder in the White House if her husband is elected
president.
   Mrs. Dukakis is the daughter of Harry Ellis Dickson, associate
conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra, and the late Jane Goldberg
Dickson, who met her future husband when both were studying music
and the arts in Berlin prior to World War II.
   They left Germany as Hitler was coming to power. While she was
raised in a Jewish home in a predominantly Jewish community, Mrs.
Dukakis has said she did not come to fully appreciate her heritage
until a 1976 visit to Israel and the Holocaust Memorial Yad Vashem
in Jerusalem.
   ``That visit changed everthing for me,'' she recently told
Haolam Hazeh, a Jewish weekly newspaper. ``I was brought up on this
memory but I don't think I understood the full significance until I
visited Yad Vashem.''
   Mrs. Dukakis was a member of a presidential commission on the
Holocaust until 1986, when President Reagan declined to appoint her
to a new term.

   The Central Intelligence Agency has planted
operatives in Nicaragua who seek to stir up public protests in an
effort to provoke the leftist Sandinista government into
overreacting, House Speaker Jim Wright said today.
   ``We have received clear testimony from CIA people that they
have deliberately done things to provoke an overreaction on the
part of the government in Nicaragua,'' Wright told reporters in
answer to a question.
   In a subsequent interview, Wright said agency personnel, under
questioning from members of Congress, said they had ``sought to
generate vigorous demonstrations. ... Agents of our government have
assisted in organizing the kinds of anti-government demonstrations
that have been calculated to stimulate and provoke arrests.''
   CIA spokeswoman Sharon Basso declined to confirm or deny
Wright's information. ``We do brief Congress, but wouldn't discuss
that publicly,'' she said.
   Wright said he did not know whether the U.S. provocations were
behind a July 10 demonstration at Nandaime, south of Managua, that
resulted in some 40 arrests. The anti-Sandininsta Contra rebels are
asking for release of those prisoners as a gesture of good faith
before resuming high-level peace talks with the government.
   But he said it is ``unmistakable'' that the CIA has been behind
some of the public unrest that has led to government crackdowns on
the opposition and worsened the atmosphere for faltering peace
discussions between the two sides.
   ``It has been foolish of the Sandinistas to respond to those
provocations,'' Wright said, referring to the shutting down of
opposition media outlets like the newspaper La Prensa and Radio
Catolica, a church-run radio station.
   ``I've made that unmistakably clear to people in Nicaragua. They
have to demonstrate their commitment to the democratization they
have announced'' in earlier peace agreements, he said.
   But Wright also condemned the U.S. interference. ``I do not
believe it is the proper role of our government to try to provoke
riots ... or deliberately to try to antagonize governing officials
into foolish overreactions,'' he said.
   ``We should be using the influence of the United States to
encourage the peace process, not discourage it.''
   The two sides broke off talks on Monday in Guatemala City after
failing to agree on a new site for resuming peace negotiations, and
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega accused the rebels of seeking to
avoid negotiations in hopes of receiving new U.S. military aid.

<HEAD>Arsonists Get Maximum in Firebombing of Drug Witness' Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge handed down maximum sentences Tuesday to
two arsonists for firebombing the house of a Guyanese immigrant who
had taken a stand against drug dealers invading his neighborhood.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Demakos sentenced Robert
Webster, 17, to 50 years to life in prison for two first-degree
arson convictions. Claude Johnson, 28, received the maximum of 25
years to life on a single arson count.
   Sentences for criminal mischief and intimidating a witness were
ordered to run concurrently with the arson terms, so the men will
serve no extra time for those crimes.
   Johnson and Webster were convicted last month of throwing
Molotov cocktails into a house in Queens. The house was owned by a
man who went by the single name of Arjune, a recent immigrant who
had complained to police about drug dealing near his home.
   The case achieved national notoriety when a police officer
assigned to guard Arjune's house after the firebombing was shot to
death as he sat in his patrol car. Police said the shooting of
Officer Edward Byrne was ordered by high-level drug dealers who
controlled the neighborhood's crack trade.
   The case led to a major police offensive against drug dealers in
the area.
   Arjune, has since been given a new home and identity under the
federal witness protection program, testified at the trial that his
house was firebombed twice early in the morning of Nov. 10, 1987.
   Johnson was arrested after the first of two attacks, which were
a couple of hours apart, but Webster participated in both, Arjune
said.

<TEXT>
   The Citadel has reached an out-of-court
settlement with its head chaplain, who had sued the state-supported
military school accusing it of interfering with worship services,
the school's lawyer said Tuesday.
   Details of the settlement with the Rev. Gordon E. Garthe will be
spelled out in a federal order in the next week or so, said M.
Dawes Cooke Jr., a Citadel lawyer. He said the settlement reached
Monday ``redefines and clarifies the job description for the
position of chaplain'' but does not include payment of damages.
   Garthe, a United Methodist minister and retired Navy chaplain,
has been director of chaplain activities at The Citadel since 1983.
He claimed in his suit that the school violated the constitutional
guarantee of freedom of religion and the prohibition of a state
religion.
   The school denied the charges, but said it had been ``critical
of (Garthe's) lack of support and general acceptance by the Corps
of Cadets.'' Garthe claimed that church attendance had nosedived
after 1973 court ruling that it could not be mandatory, but that it
had actually increased after he was hired 10 years later.
   Efforts to reach Garthe for comment on the settlement were
unsuccessful. A person answering the telephone in his office said
he would not be in Tuesday.
   In his suit, Garthe also claimed he was threatened with firing
after he complained that offerings collected at Protestant worship
services on Sundays went to the state's general fund.
   The chaplain accused the military college of controlling such
things as the choice of speakers at services, uniform requirements,
seating, flag display, the bearing of arms in the chancel and
selection of music.

   Vice President George Bush campaigned in
a flag factory Tuesday and declared, ``My friends, flag sales are
doing well and America is doing well.''
   Bush, who has sought to turn the Pledge of Allegiance to the
flag into an election issue, toured the Annin Flag Co. and then
spoke at a rally outside, talking about patriotism as well as
stressing what he said were economic accomplishments of the Reagan
administration.
   The Republican presidential nominee reiterated his contention
that Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis had ``raised taxes several
times as governor of Massachusetts and I believe he will raise them
again if you elect him president.''
   ``Americans have a new economic power, and I'm not going to let
them take that away from you,'' he said, with a huge American flag
as a backdrop.
   ``The flags you make fly over an America that today is stronger
and more prosperous than at any time in its proud history,'' Bush
told a group of several hundred people, many of them employees of
the plant.
   Inside, he chatted with workers at sewing machines, and at one
point he pushed a foot pedal attached to a machine that cut cloth.
   Bush has cited the small factory in speeches around the country,
noting that its sales had been up since Reagan and he took office
in 1981.
   He joked that he and Dukakis, whose rallies also prominently
feature American flags, were ``responsible for only half'' of the
purchases of 37,000 flags the plant manufactures each week.
   The company is the nation's largest flag maker.
   Bush returned to Washington to swear in Lauro Cavazos, a fellow
Texan, as the Secretary of Education.
   Hispanic leaders have questioned the timing of Reagan's decision
to nominate Cavazos in the waning months of his administration.
Bush had said he would appoint Hispanics to his cabinet, and
critics suggest Reagan speeded the process to help Bush's candidacy
in Texas and other states with high Hispanic populations.
   Bush is spending most of his time this week preparing for
Sunday's nationally televised debate with Dukakis.
   Bush is reviewing issues and possible questions with top aides
and policy advisers and later in the week will engage in mock
debates with former Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard G. Darman,
aides have said.
   Asked by reporters how Bush's debate preparation was going,
campaign political director Richard Bond said: ``Diligent.''
   ``You want to avoid costly mistakes. And you want to come across
as presidential,'' Bond said.
   In his flag speech, Bush's amplified voice easily drowned out
the shouts of a few dozen protesters, two of whom were carrying
signs that said: ``Patriotism is the Last Refuge of a Scroundrel _
Samuel Johnson.''
   Also, Craig Livingston, a lawyer representing the United
Textiles Workers of America, passed out copies of a statement
accusing the administration of a ``do-nothing trade policy'' that
resulted in layoffs of ``thousands of our sisters and brothers in
industry.''
   Livingston told reporters that textile workers are among the
poorest paid of all workers and that the average wage of those in
the Annin flag plant was between $4 and $5 an hour.
   Company president Randy Beard, who introduced Bush, said that
never ``has flag demand been as strong as in these past five to six
years. I don't know why it happened, but it happened during the
Reagan-Bush watch.''
   In his speech, Bush accused Dukakis of accentuating only
negative economic statistics. ``I would hate to try to win the
presidency by being so negative,'' he said.
   On this day, he spared Dukakis from some of the attacks that he
himself has made in recent campaign appearances.
   Bush has made much of the Pledge of Allegiance issue in his
campaign, attacking Dukakis for vetoing Massachusetts legislation
to require public school teachers to lead their classes in saying
the pledge. However, he did not raise that issue in Tuesday's
speech.
   Bond, the political director, said New Jersey is one of nine
states the campaign views as crucial battlegrounds in the fall
election.
   The others are California, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois,
Missouri, Texas, Michigan and Wisconsin, Bond said.
   ``None of them are out of reach for either candidate. These are
the states that are going to get an awful lot of attention,'' he
said.
   Bush, after his speech, stopped at the Glenwood Diner a few
blocks away, ordered a cup of coffee and a piece of crumb cake and
bantered with patrons.
   Several women in the diner told Bush he looked better in person
than on television. He asked them why they thought so.
   ``Because you're relaxed,'' suggested Lucie Galioto, who said
she had stopped by the diner with friends on the way home from a
senior citizens exercise class. ``This way, everything is
spontaneous,'' she added.
   ``You may have something there,'' the vice president said. With
his nationally televised debate with Dukakis less than a week away,
Bush said he would have to work on appearing more relaxed in front
of the cameras.

<HEAD>Group Says Treaty Should Cover Solvents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International agreements to preserve the
earth's protective ozone layer should cover two industrial solvents
outside the current treaty, an environmental group said Tuesday.
   The solvents, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, can
also liberate chlorine that destroys ozone high in the
stratosphere, just as the better-known chlorofluorocarbon or CFC
compounds do, said the Environmental Policy Institute in a study of
the ozone problem.
   Arjun Makhijani, an engineer and consultant who was principal
author of the study, said methyl chloroform, the most common
industrial solvent, probably accounts for one-quarter of current
ozone destruction.
   The Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance, principal trade
association of manufacturers and major users of solvents containing
chlorine, said it believed the institute had relied on outdated
science and had overstated the potency of the two solvents.
   Steve Seidel, an ozone expert at the Environmental Protection
Agency, said very little carbon tetrachloride is escaping to the
atmosphere and methyl chloroform is a ``definitely second tier''
source of ozone destruction.
   About 124,000 tons of methyl chloroform are used worldwide each
year, the institute said. U.S. use, for such tasks as degreasing
metal in the auto industry, is about 35 percent of that total.
   Some 227,000 tons of carbon tetrachloride are used each year, 80
percent of it as a raw material for production of
chlorofluorocarbon compounds. Analysts including Makijani agree
that production will decline as CFC production drops under the 1987
treaty calling for 50 percent cuts by 1998.
   Methyl chloroform stays in the atmosphere only nine or 10 years
on average before breaking down, said Makhijani. So short a
lifetime means ``80 percent of methyl chloroform never gets to the
stratosphere. But because there's so much of it, the 30 percent
that reaches the stratosphere is more destructive than CFC-113,''
one of the solvents regulated by the treaty, he said.
   Because the lifetime is so short, reductions in emissions would
mean an early decline in atmospheric chlorine, he said. The CFC
compounds can last more than a century, and the atmospheric backlog
plus all that has accumulated in earth-bound products such as
refrigerators means the effects of production cuts will be a long
time showing an effect.
   ``We have a few problems with the numbers they used this
morning,'' said Tom Cortina, spokesman for the industry group.
``Five to 10 percent is probably a more accurate'' estimate of
ozone destruction from methyl chloroform.
   Controls are not needed on either solvent, but if they are
``they should be based on international agreement,'' said fellow
spokesman Steve Risotto.
   Seidel of EPA said the agency estimated that methyl chloroform
was only about 10 percent as destructive of ozone as the most
powerful CFC compound.

<TEXT>
   Police stepped up patrols near the home of
Rep. Mike Espy on Tuesday after the black congressman expressed
concern for his family in the wake of vandalism at his home that
included racial slurs.
   ``I'm the congressman, not my wife, my brother or my children,''
Espy said as he cleaned paint poured on an entrance-way floor at
his home in suburban Madison. ``I can defend myself but I want them
to leave my family out of it.''
   Espy said his wife returned to home late Monday to find a racial
slur on doors in the entrance-way. He said the words, at the top of
each door, appeared to have been scratched into the wood by ``a
pencil or a pen without ink. They had started the words `U.S. Con'
on one door but it appeared the point of what they were using had
broken.''
   Madison Police Chief Jimmy Dukes said he sent officers to the
house. ``And, of course, we are going to have extra patrols in that
area _ that goes without saying,'' Dukes said.
   ``Sure it makes you angry,'' Espy said. ``We've come a long way
in Mississippi but cases like this remind you how far we've got to
go.''
   Espy, a Democrat and the state's first black congressman since
Reconstruction, is being challenged in the November election by
white Republican Jack Coleman. Espy has been leading polls in the
district. His brother has been his campaign manager.
   Espy said he would immediately return to the campaign but was
concerned for his family.
   ``My son is 5 and my daughter is 8 and I had to explain to them
the history of race relations in Mississippi,'' he said. Referring
to the scratched epithet, he said, ``I had to tell my children what
that meant and why somebody would do that. It was not an easy thing
to do.''
   Espy said plants in the entry-way had been uprooted and paint
dashed on some of the plants.
   ``Something like this should not be a part of the American
political process,'' said Coleman, contacted by telephone as he
headed to Belzoni for a day of campaigning. ``We should talk about
the issues and beat each other on top of the head with those.''
   ``I can't imagine any of my people doing that,'' Coleman said.
``Who knows why someone would do something like this. It may not
have had anything to do with politics but no matter why it was
done, it was totally wrong and I regret to see it.''
   Espy, 34, said he had received threatening calls in the past,
``but you always expect those. There has not been an increase in
those calls and this is the first time something like this has
happened.''
   ``I think most Mississippians would be upset to hear something
like this has happened but we all realize there are still some
ignorant people running around,'' he said.

   The Reagan years have been great for the
flag business, says a member of the family that owns the nation's
largest flag-making company.
   ``The flag market usually has ups and downs, but it's been a
steady incline since the Reagan administration came aboard,'' said
C. Lee Beard, vice presidant of Annin & Co.
   The fourth-generation co-owner and his brother, Randolph, opened
one of their New Jursey factories Tuesday to Vice President George
Bush, who has mentioned the company often in contending that the
administration has revived patriotic fervor.
   ``My friends, flag sales are doing well and America is doing
well,'' Bush said in front of a crowd of about 250, many of them
Annin employees, in a flag-waving rally across the street from the
old brick factory.
   C. Lee Beard, whose brother joined Bush on the rostrum, said the
company has enjoyed a sales increase of roughly 25 percent in the
Reagan years. Annin is one of a handful of major companies making
the stars and stripes.
   Beard said he could not provide exact sales figures.
   He credited Reagan for the steady growth of his company, which
has expanded from three to five plants during Reagan's term.
   ``I think his patriotism has stirred flag sales,'' Beard said.
``He's increased pride in America.''
   While Annin has supplied flags for inaugurations, the Apollo 11
moon flight, the United Nations and the armed forces, everyday
citizens still account for the bulk of sales, Beard said.
   He said the Bloomfield factory each week makes about 30,000 of
the small flags that have lately become common fare at patriotic
celebrations.
   In addition, about 7,000 to 10,000 of the 3-by-5-foot flags
commonly displayed by homeowners are produced each week at the
factory, where women operate machines by hand, starting at minimum
wage.
   In another flag-interest indicator, the federal government last
year satisfied more than 109,000 requests to briefly fly flags over
the nation's Capitol and then ship them to people.
   The requests numbered just 43,011 in 1979, a clerk said.
   While Reagan deserves credit for the sales trend, Beard said
this year's unusually strong September might also have something to
do with Bush's campaign.
   Labor Day usually marks a fast drop in flag buying, but demand
has held steady in 1988, Beard said.
   The company found out about Bush's visit about a week ago, and
quickly arranged five buses to haul in employees from its three
other New Jersey locations, Beard said. Annin also has a plant in
Ohio.
   Despite the good business of recent years, Beard said he's
spotted a less-welcome trend: an influx of the red-white-and-blue
from factories in Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
   Those countries' lower labor costs enable them to sell flags at
a lower price and American producers are starting to feel the
pinch, Beard said.

<HEAD>House Approves Eight-Year Pesticide Safety Deadline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved stepped-up pesticide
regulation Tuesday, voting to set an accelerated, eight-year
deadline for completion of safety reviews of hundreds of chemicals
used by farmers to protect crops.
   The measure, approved and sent to the Senate on a voice vote,
amounts to a bare-bones bill without groundwater-protection and
other contoversial features urged by environmentalists.
   ``This is the art of the possible, this will not satisfy hardly
anyone but this is what we can do at this point,'' House
Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas,
said in urging approval. He said lawmakers could return to the
tougher issues in the future.
   The bill calls for completion of hundreds of safety reviews by
the Environmental Protection Agency within eight years. The process
is designed to end use of the most hazardous chemicals and limit
utilization of others that present health dangers.
   The reviews have been in progress since the mid-1970s but
without a deadline. The General Accounting Office estimates that at
the current pace of about two dozen a year the task would not be
completed until 2024.
   The bill would largely end indemnities to pesticide makers whose
products have been ordered off the market for safety reasons. Thus
far, the EPA has been forced to pay $20 million to buy up supplies
of banned pesticides.
   Provisions of the bill call for fees paid by manufacturers
ranging from $50,000 to $150,000 to finance the reviews. The
industry and the agency would share the cost of storage and
disposal under the measure, which would reauthorize for three years
the 1947 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.
   Environmentalists say the EPA has been dragging its feet on the
safety reviews because it lacks the money to pay the indemnities.
   The act has been due for reauthorization since 1983 but
squabbling among environmentalists, labor and the farm lobby have
frozen action.
   ``We have had difficulty in times past in trying to make this
happen,'' Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., told the House.
   Farmers have been highly suspicious of legislation they fear
would ban or raise the cost of pesticides, which arose out of World
War II chemical warfare research and now represent a fundamental
element of U.S. agriculture.
   ``Certainly with regard to agriculture, the efficient and
judicious use of pesticides is crucial to the safety of the food
supply that we enjoy today,'' declared Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa.
   Government research, however, has shown that some pesticides can
cause cancer and other severe health problems. Environmentalists
have been calling for tighter regulation since 1962 when naturalist
Rachel Carson spotlighted the problem in her bestselling ``Silent
Spring.''
   Most environmentalists have been saying the current bill is
better than nothing or, at least, would not make the situation
worse. But they point to a lack of any component that would step up
monitoring of groundwater, which provides the basic drinking supply
for half of all Americans.
   A report issued last week by the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group, an organization founded by Ralph Nader, said a search of EPA
records showed that 73 pesticides have been found in groundwater in
34 states.
   Moreover, some environmental groups were opposed to the
legislation.
   ``We're not willing to put pesticide regulation on the back
burner for three to four years,'' said Jay Feldman of the National
Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides. ``That's not any kind
of message to be sending out across the country to people who are
facing chemicals in their drinking water, chemicals in their
workplace and chemicals in their food.''

   A federal jury Tuesday convicted a British aircraft
broker of trying to sell 10 embargoed U.S. helicopters to Iran.
   The federal jury deliberated 90 minutes before finding Colin
Breeze, 34, of Manchester, England, guilty of conspiring to falsify
export documents in an attempt to hide the re-export of the used
Sikorsky S-76 helicopters from Jordan to Iran.
   His attorney, Laurie Beloff, said she would appeal.
   Breeze faces a maximum of 10 years in federal prison; U.S.
District Judge Stanley Marcus set sentencing Oct. 31.
   Breeze also had been indicted for soliciting others to falsify
documents, but Marcus dismissed that count earlier Tuesday, ruling
no such charge exists in federal law.
   During trial, Breeze denied he intentially broke the law, saying
he was set up by a government informant who told him the sale was
legal.
   After the verdict, Breeze was returned to the federal
Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami where he has been
held since his arrest June 28.
   Breeze and co-defendant Graham Reavell, who apparently cannot be
extradited from Spain on the charges, were accused of trying to win
approval of the $30 million sale to Iran by falsifying so-called
end use certificates.
   The certificates did not state Iran was the ultimate destination
for the helicopters, which are ideal for transporting troops in the
desert.
   U.S. Customs Service investigators allege the defendants worked
with Iran's ambassador to Spain.

   The five new Cabinet ministers approved
by Iran's parliament Tuesday include an ex-guerrilla who fought
against the Shah, a former student who occupied the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran and two ministers with graduate degrees from American
universities.
   Tehran Radio said the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, rejected a
sixth appointee, the prospective minister of commerce Majid
Hedayatzadeh, in the second vote of confidence in Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi's government in eight days.
   The Iranian news agency IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said the new
Revolutionary Guards minister, Ali Shamkhani, 33, was a senior aide
of Commander-in-Chief Hashemi Rafsanjani. Shamkhani also was
Rafsanjani's deputy for operations and information at military
command headquarters, IRNA said.
   Shamkhani takes over from Mohsen Rafiqdoust, the victim of a
no-confidence vote in the first parliament session on Sept. 12.
That session was held amid criticism of the Revolutionary Guards,
blamed for several battlefield defeats that led Tehran to accept a
cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war in July.
   The radio said Hedayatzadeh could not muster the necessary
votes, with only 94 deputies supporting him.
   No one was given that portfolio in the first Cabinet Musavi
presented. It was not clear if the Majlis objected to
Hedayatzadeh's credentials or to the post itself.
   In the previous round, the ministers of agriculture and
education were rejected. On Tuesday, Issa Kalantari was installed
as agriculture minister and Mohammed Ali Najafi as minister of
education.
   The Majlis approved Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, 36, construction
minister until he resigned in July, as energy minister. Gholamreza
Forouzesh, one of Zangeneh's aides, was installed as new minister
of construction.
   IRNA said Shamkhani was a guerrilla in the underground campaign
against Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi before the 1979 revolution that
brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power.
   Shamkhani commanded the Revolutionary Guards along the southern
front after the gulf war started in 1980 and later rose to the post
of deputy commander of the guards. IRNA said two of his brothers,
Mohammad and Hamid, died in the war.
   An Iranian political analyst, speaking in Nicosia on condition
of anonymity, said Shamkhani was at one point entrusted with
chasing dissidents opposed to Khomeini's fundamentalist regime,
known as the Mujahedeen Khalq.
   IRNA said Forouzesh, 33, was one of the students who took over
the American Embassy in November 1979. The report did not say
whether he was involved in keeping U.S. officials hostage for 444
days.
   Kalantari, 36, has a doctorate in agriculture from Iowa
University and a masters degree from the University of Nebraska.
His brother Mousa, then minister of roads and transportation, died
in a 1981 bomb blast that killed numerous top officials, IRNA said.
   Najafi, 37, has a masters degree in mathematics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, IRNA said. Since 1984 he has
worked as head of training at the Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting Corp.

<HEAD>Meeting Could Lead to Resumption of Base Talks</HEAD>

   Resumption of suspended negotiations on the
future of U.S. military bases in Greece could depend on the Greek
foreign minister's planned talks here Wednesday with Secretary of
State George Shultz, a senior Shultz aide said Tuesday.
   Foreign Minister Carolas Papoulias is scheduled to meet and
lunch with Shultz in his capacity as current representative of the
European Common Market, but U.S.-Greek relations also will be
covered, Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway told a
congressional panel.
   Negotiations in Athens on American military bases were suspended
Sept. 5 when Ambassador Alan Flanigan, the U.S. negotiator,
returned to Washington for instructions on a ``major element'' in
the Greek position. That was identified as a demand for U.S. forces
to vacate Hellenikon air base at Athens International Airport, Ms.
Ridgway said.
   Resumption was tentatively scheduled for October, but the date
is undecided and ``whether it takes place'' depends partly on talks
with Papoulias, she told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
European and Middle Eastern Affairs.
   ``The disposition of Hellenikon will have to be resolved ... how
it is going to be dealt with affects the whole negotiations,'' she
said.
   Ms. Ridgway did not disclose the U.S. response to the demand for
its planes to leaveHellenikon. She said in answer to a question
that if agreement cannot be reached, ``we have procedures for
leaving'' but ``we are not at any stage of starting that at this
time.''
   Subcommittee Chairman Lee Hamilton asked if the illness of Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou, reported to be facing heart surgery,
would affect the base negotiations. The Greek government has said
repeatedly that foreign policy is unaffected by Papandreou's
illness and officials have been instructed to carry on their
functions, Ms. Ridgway replied.
   As to whether the base negotiations would be completed before
parliamentary elections, she said this was uncertain because
setting of the election date is linked to the prime minister's
health.

   The Senate Rules Committee voted Tuesday to
appropriate an additional $108,000 for the special committee
investigating the Bureau of Indian Affairs and alleged
mismanagement of natural resources such as gas and oil.
   Last November, the committee unanimously authorized a yearlong,
$740,000 investigation into alleged fraud, mismanagement and
malfeasance in the administration of housing, education and health
programs.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Select
Committee on Indian Affairs, said the investigation ``is the most
professional I have seen,'' even more so than the Iran-contra of
which he was the co-chairman.
   He said the special committee headed by Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., had issued 130 subpoenas and interviewed or taken
depositions from over 300 individuals.
   Inouye said there have been allegations of malfeasance,
negligence and criminal activity in which the dollar sum may exceed
$11 billion.
   DeConcini said the special committee would not be rushed in its
investigation. He said hearings would be held early in 1989.
   When the DeConcini committee was formed last year, Inouye said
the allegations of mismanagement ``extend to almost ever aspect of
the administration of Indian affairs, and include the development
of Indian trust resources, and the management of housing programs,
health programs, education programs, economic development
initiatives, and the administration of law enforcement on Indian
reservations.''
   The special investigation was prompted by a series of articles
in The Arizona Republic last October. The newspaper reported that
multi-million dollar federal Indian programs are plagued by fraud,
incompetence and deceit.
   As an example, Inouye said 34 reports of the Interior
Department's inspector general and an equal number of reports
issued by the General Accounting Office, the congressional
investigative arm, since the early 1970s estimate that the Interior
Department has failed to collect approximately $5.7 billion in oil
and gas royalties from oil companies.
   Inouye said the Interior and GAO reports also document another
$5.8 billion worth of oil and gas that has been illegally siphoned
off of Indian and public lands.
   An Arizona Republic account, he said, indicates that the
resulting ``windfall to oil companies has been placed at more than
$1 billion a year in studies by the Interior Department's inspector
general, the General Accounting Office and congressional panels.''

<HEAD>Drought Slows Price Rise In Farland; 1989 Recovery Seen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought appears to have slowed the
recovery in farmland values, but appraisers think land prices will
rise at a healthy clip in 1989, the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.
   Rural appraisers surveyed in August by the department's Economic
Research Service reported only a 1.2 percent increase nationally in
farmland values for May, June and July, compared with a 1.8 percent
gain in the first quarter of the year.
   ``While the appreciation rate for farmland could continue to
slow in coming months, the appraisers were more bullish for the
year ahead, expecting a 4.6 percent rise in values,'' the report
said. ``Last May, surveyed appraisers anticipated only a 3.6
percent gain for the coming year.''
   Farmland prices began rising in 1987, ending a 6-year decline
that was part of the worst financial crunch in U.S. agriculture
since the Depression.
   In a related report, the agency released new 1987 farm income
statistics which showed state rankings for the first time.
California, as usual, headed the list.
   Nine of the top 10 states for net farm income in 1987 were there
in 1986, the Economic Research Service said. North Carolina
replaced Washington in 1987.
   The top 10 states accounted for 54 percent of total U.S. net
farm income in 1987, compared with 54.5 percent in 1986.
   The new preliminary state estimates for 1987 showed net farm
income nationally at $46.3 billion, up more than 23 percent from
calendar 1986.
   Economists said the largest percentage increases were in
Wyoming, South Carolina, Maine, Louisiana, Mississippi and Nevada.
   ``The Wyoming and Nevada gains were due largely to increased
value of livestock product marketings,'' the report said. Higher
cattle prices and livestock inventory reductions contributed.
   Improved farm income in South Carolina, Maine, Louisiana and
Mississippi resulted from increased production and higher prices
for tobacco, potatoes, cotton and cottonseed. Generally, production
increased from a relatively poor year in 1986.
   Net farm income is the difference between gross farm income and
total expenses during a calendar year and measures the profit or
loss associated with production in a given year.
   Additions to inventories are treated as income, and allowances
are made for ``non-money '' items such as depreciation, the
consumption of farm-grown food, and the net rental value of
dwellings.
   The agency also uses a method of accounting for ``net cash
income,'' which is the difference between gross cash income and
cash expenses. Current sales from inventories produced in other
years are counted as gross income.
   Net cash income is often preferred by some economists since it
shows how much actual money farmers have to spend during a year. In
1987, net cash income was estimated at a record $57.1 billion,
compared with the net income of $46.3 billion.
   The USDA has forecast 1988 net farm income may be in the range
of $38 billion to $43 billion, and that net cash income could be
$55 billion to $60 billion.
   ``Net farm income is typically much more volatile than net cash
income because weather often causes sharp changes in production
that lead to swings in inventory values,'' the report said.

   A heavyset white woman in her 40s is
pictured in a drawing released by a federal agency Tuesday of a
suspect in the July discovery of 13 time bombs planted in the small
town of Salem.
   The bombs, which caused no serious damage, were found near
buildings and under the bridges that provide the only access to the
southern Indiana community of about 6,000 people.
   The devices contained timers attached to as many as 26 sticks of
gelatine dynamite and were packaged in paper grocery sacks. They
were concealed at various sites in and near the downtown square.
   The drawing was released by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms and the Indiana State Police.
   A military explosives expert said at the time that the bomber
either lacked the expertise to properly wire the bombs or did not
have an essential component.
   Three of the dynamite bundles exploded, but produced only smoke
and small fires. The 10 others were defused by bomb experts.
   No one was injured, but authorities said the bombs could have
caused widespread destruction.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the eighth year running, the Oriental Hotel
in Bangkok, Thailand, has been rated the world's best hotel in a
survey conducted by Institutional Investor magazine.
   Taking the next three spots were the Regent of Hong Kong, the
Vier Jahreszeiten of Hamburg, West Germany, and the Mandarin
Oriental of Hong Kong, all holding the same rankings they had in
1987.
   The financial monthly magazine polls about 100 senior bankers
from around the world who do a lot of traveling and asks them to
rate their favorite hotels on a scale of 1 to 100.
   The top U.S. hotel was the Carlyle of New York, rated No. 12.
Five U.S. hotels were in the top 25.
   The Connaught of London moved up to fifth place from eighth last
year and the Shangri La of Singapore advanced from ninth to sixth.
   The Okura of Tokyo moved down from sixth to seventh and the Ritz
of Paris fell to eighth from fifth. The Bristol of Paris, unrated
in 1987, took ninth place, and the Peninsula of Hong Kong once
again held 10th place.
   The top-ranked Oriental, under German manager Kurt Wachtveitl,
has a staff of 1,000 and has completed a $20 million renovation,
Institutional Investor says in its September issue.
   Rounding out the top 25 hotels are:
   _Plaza Athenee, Paris.
   _Carlyle, New York.
   _Claridge's, London.
   _Dolder Grand, Zurich, Switzerland.
   _Stanford Court, San Francisco.
   _Baur au Lac, Zurich, Switzerland.

<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department on Tuesday
excluded farmers and firefighters from a federal requirement that
drivers of large trucks have a special license, saying these groups
do not have a poor traffic safety record.
   The announcement came after several months of public hearings
and protests from the farm community over new federal requirements
that are aimed at anyone driving a truck weighing more than 26,000
pounds or any vehicles carrying hazardous cargo.
   Farmers have complained that the special license requirement as
enacted by Congress would cover drivers of large trucks carrying
grain and hay, even some pickup trucks, bulk fuel and fertilizer
tanks and firefighters driving emergency vehicles.
   The law provides for the department to allow exemptions.
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said the states are being
notified that they may exempt farm-to-market truck operators as
long as the vehicles are used to transport agricultural products,
farm machinery or farm supplies no more than 150 miles from home.
   ``Generally these vehicles have a better accident record than
`non-farm' vehicles of similar size,'' the department concluded. In
1982, the most recent year cited, the accident rate for farm
vehicles was less than half the rate for non-farm vehicles, it said.
   Additionally, the department said, the states may exclude
drivers of firefighting equipment operated by municipalities or
volunteer fire departments as well as military personnel, including
National Guardsmen, who drive military vehicles.
   Congress enacted the law in 1986 to tighten control over drivers
who drive large commercial trucks from state to state. It is aimed
at ending the practice by some commercial drivers of obtaining
licenses from a number of states to conceal traffic violations. The
law also requires minimum standards for commercial drivers and a
testing program.
   Both the licenses and testing continue to be administered by the
states.
   At the same time, the department said it was rejecting requests
for similar waivers to transit operators, railroad employees and
public utility employees.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., principal author of the 1986 law
requiring the special licensing, said he agreed with the
department's decision.
   ``The law ... was not intended to unduly burden farmers as they
transport their grain to the silo or their crops to market,''
Danforth said in a statement.

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises to 140 in Flash Flood From Hurricane Gilbert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of confirmed dead in a flash
flood caused by Hurricane Gilbert rose to 140 Tuesday, and
authorities said a fifth passenger bus had been located in a drying
river bed.
   ``We have recovered 140 cadavers. It's difficult to say how many
more there could be. It could be very terrible,'' said Daniel
Dimas, assistant information secretary for the Nuevo Leon state
government.
   Dimas said by telephone that most of the bodies were being found
in the Santa Catarina River about 20 miles downstream from
Monterrey.
   Earlier, authorities said about 100 bodies had been recovered
and estimated that 200 overall may have been killed in the flooding.
   Rains unleashed by Hurricane Gilbert in the 14,000-foot-high
mountains surrounding this state capital sent waters raging through
the normally dry river bed on Saturday. The flash flood swept away
five passenger buses and private vehicles that were traveling on
roads built in the river bed.
   The Santa Catarina divides Monterrey, which has a population of
3 million and is the largest metropolitan area in northern Mexico.
   The flash flood, the worst Monterrey has seen since 1909, also
swept away squatters' homes, streets, electricity towers and miles
of sports facilities that had built on the dry riverbed.
   State authorities estimated damage at $90 million.
   The torrent's destructive path extended for nearly 40 miles.
Hundreds of homes were destroyed and thousands more flooded with
water and mud. About 30,000 people remained in shelters Tuesday.
   Dimas said the fifth passenger bus had been located in the river
bed 30 miles downstream from here.
   The bus is one of four intercity and one urban buses that were
swept into the river in Monterrey.
   Army soldiers digging through rubble in the crushed and
overturned skeleton of the local bus found two decaying bodies
inside it on Monday, the daily Monterrey newspaper El Norte
reported.
   Dimas said ranches in the mountain region around Monterrey and a
village of about 100 families remained cut off Tuesday by flooding
and mudslides.
   ``We're trying to find out what we can do to get supplies to
these people,'' he said.
   The flood waters, which were 10 feet deep and 150 yards wide,
had subsided to a shallow trickle about 15 feet wide by Tuesday.
   But many parts of the Monterrey area remained without water
because of damaged pumps.
   Health authorities were recommending that citizens throughout
the region boil water because of increased risk of viral and
bacterial infections caused by contaminated water.
   ``The water treatment plants are working beyond capacity,'' said
Jorge Cavazos, state health secretary.
   ``The water could be contaminated with fecal matter and
sediments,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Apart from the damage and deaths in Monterrey and Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula, the storm killed at least 71 people and
destroyed thousands of homes in Texas, Jamaica, Honduras, the
Cayman Islands, Haiti and Puerto Rico.

<HEAD>Bennett, In Last Day As Education Secretary, Bashes Dukakis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett spent his
last day in office Tuesday berating Michael Dukakis and contending
Dukakis advisers ``tend to look down their noses at the basic and
instinctive patriotism of a lot of the American people.''
   Bennett also criticized Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor and
Democratic presidential nominee, for vetoing legislation that would
have penalized teachers unless they led their students in the
Pledge of Allegiance.
   But in attacking the Dukakis veto, which followed advisory
opinions from the state attorney general and supreme court that the
bill was unconstitutional, Bennett also agreed with Dukakis that
any student who objects should not be required to recite the pledge.
   Dukakis supporters turned out in force to greet Bennett, terming
him a hypocrite for criticizing Dukakis at a time when state
spending on education has increased significantly and the Reagan
administration had tried to cut programs and eliminate the
Education Department.
   Bennett, appearing at a news conference on behalf of Republican
presidential nominee George Bush, said Dukakis had at best an
average record on education and called his veto of the pledge bill
``his most famous educational act.''
   Bennett said he would oppose such a law at the federal level
because education is a state issue. But he said he supported state
laws that required the pledge while excusing students who object on
religious or other grounds.
   Dukakis believes recitation of the pledge should be a voluntary
tradition in schools, while Bennett called for state laws that
require recitation but do not penalize students who object.
   ``If you don't like the Pledge of Allegiance you're going to
hate the Declaration of Independence,'' Bennett said.
   In a 1986 assessment, Bennett praised improvements in SAT scores
that moved Massachusetts into the top third of states which
administer the tests and also credited the state for putting ``in
place important reforms to improve teacher quality through testing
of new teachers, performance incentives and alternative
certifications to attract the most qualified candidates into
teaching.''
   After being read those comments Tuesday, Bennett said, ``Check
the record and see what belongs to Dukakis and what belongs to
King,'' a reference to former Gov. Edward J. King. When told the
teacher-quality legislation was part of a package Dukakis supported
in 1985, Bennett said, ``that may well be ... the governor's record
itself is not distinguished.''
   Bennett, during a recent television appearance, said most
Dukakis advisers come from Brookline and Cambridge, communities
where he said many residents have ``disdain'' for patriotism.
   Bennett, whose tenure was marked by such outspoken and
controversial comments, refused to apologize Tuesday but said he
was referring specifically to Dukakis advisers.
   ``A lot of the Dukakis crowd, the Dukakis advisers, do have, I
think, a sense of intellectual superiority and do tend to look down
their noses at the basic and instinctive patriotism of a lot of the
American people,'' Bennett said.
   At the earlier meeting with reporters, Brookline state Rep.
Eleanor Myerson invited Bennett to visit her town, where Dukakis,
the Democratic presidential nominee, grew up and still lives.
   ``If Mr. Bennett thinks Brookline disdains basic American
values, he should visit our town and visit the Civil War, World War
I, World War II, Korean War and Vietnam veteran memorials honoring
Brookline citizens who died to protect his freedom to insult their
memory,'' Myerson said.

   Four inmates who were issued pink prison
uniforms to show they have been exposed to the AIDS virus are suing
the sheriff, contending the outfits stigmatize them and constitute
cruel and unusual punishment.
   The complaint filed Monday was part of an amendment to a lawsuit
the Orleans Parish Jail inmates already filed alleging they are
kept segregated in cramped quarters and denied regular exercise,
counseling and adequate medical care.
   Sheriff Charles Foti said he is not singling the inmates out for
punishment or humiliation. Color-coded uniforms are used at the
jail to designate the sections to which inmates are assigned, he
said.
   Light pink, or rose colored, scrub suits are the color in the
jail's infectious-disease unit, he said.
   ``If they were in white or green, would that make a
difference?'' he said. ``What is pink? I wear pink all the time.
Pastel colors _ that's a very soothing type of color.''
   Foti said he recently adopted the color code because the cotton
scrub suits and jump suits are lighter and easier to clean and keep
track of.
   Federal prisoners wear blue, inmates who are housed in the tents
in the prison yard wear white, and inmates in the prison's general
medical ward wear green, Foti said.

   The House on Tuesday passed and sent to the
Senate a bill aimed at permitting the Bureau of Land Management to
resume transfers of land to Western municipalities and counties for
landfills.
   The bill, approved on a voice vote with minimal debate, exempts
landfills from the requirement in current law that land leased or
sold to municipalities revert to the government if used for
purposes not spelled out in the deed.
   This requirement could leave the federal government liable for
cleanup of any hazardous waste placed in municipal landfills, the
bureau concluded last year in suspending transfers of parcels for
landfills.
   More than 300 communities have acquired landfills this way.
   The Interior Committee added a requirement to the bill that
virgin land be inspected to make sure it contains no hazardous
waste, and that towns, cities and counties getting these parcels
pledge to follow hazardous waste laws and regulations.
   But these requirements do not affect existing landfills.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of the environment and
natural resources subcommittee of the Government Operations
Committee, had sought tougher requirements from the Interior
Committee. His subcommittee reported two years ago that the bureau
was ignoring guidelines promulgated by the Environmental Protection
Agency for landfills under the jurisdiction of federal agencies.
   ``Let me urge the BLM to be responsible'' in moving land to
municipal ownership, including leased land, Synar said in a
statement on the floor Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The Greens environmental group fared so
well in elections last Sunday that they might not be able to fill
all the seats they won on local and town councils, party officials
said Tuesday.
   The Greens became the first new party in 70 years to make its
way into Sweden's parliament, winning 20 seats in the 349-member
Riksdag.
   Their popularity was boosted by ecological concern and a plague
that killed thousands of seals in the northern seas, making the
environment the top issue in the election campaign.
   The Swedish environmentalists became the second largest Greens
party in Europe, winning 5.5 percent of the vote.
   Greens hold 43 seats in the West German Bundestag, about 9
percent of the total. Environmental parties also are in the
parliaments of Italy, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg,
Portugal, Iceland and Finland.
   The Greens also won seats in 260 of Sweden's 284 municipal
councils. But party officials said that as of late Monday the
loose-knit organization had no members to fill all its seats in 23
of them.
   Party official Anders Lindberg said that in some districts the
Greens had asked people not to vote for them for lack of local
candidates, and urged them to support other local parties with
strong environmental programs.
   But Greens ballots were available at all polling stations, and
many voters ignored the call.
   In Sweden, anyone can register as a candidate for local office
simply by writing his or her name on the ballot.
   Lindberg said that when early opinion polls indicated strong
support for the Greens, ``we had to urge our more reluctant,
passive members to put their names down'' as candidates.
   ``Now there are a handful of cases where we have no members to
take our seats,'' Lindberg said. He expressed concern that ``a
perfect stranger'' hostile to the environmentalists could take a
Greens seat.
   If no candidate is registered, the seat will remain empty for
the three-year term.
   The Greens also face the question of whether to give up their
decentralized ideology and organize a more rigid party machinery.
They have virtually no national organization or official party
leaders, but two people, Eva Goes and Birger Schlaug, have emerged
as semiofficial spokesmen.
   The Greens advocate abolishing nuclear power within three years,
raising taxes on energy and allocating more funds to alternative
energy sources.
   The party also campaigned for developing the railway system to
take air-polluting cars and buses off the roads, stopping the
burning of toxic waste, putting industry under stricter pollution
controls, and encouraging biological farming.
   One problem the party's victory resolved was its financial debts
from its unsuccessful 1982 election bid. As a sitting party in
parliament, the Greens will receive government funds _ up to $1
million during its first year.

   Three men and a woman, their nude bodies
found bound and gagged, were shot to death execution-style Tuesday,
apparently in drug-related violence, authorities said.
   Escambia County Sheriff Vince Seely refused to comment on
reports that a woman survived the shootings, which occurred at 1
a.m. at a duplex in the unincorporated community of Pleasant Grove
just west of Pensacola, on the Florida Panhandle.
   But neighbor who didn't want to be identified said her son saw a
woman in the middle of the highway, calling for help, just as an
ambulance and sheriff's deputies arrived.
   There were several suspects but no arrests by midafternoon,
Seely said. The bodies had not been positively identified.
   Police agencies across the state were alerted to watch for two
cars believed to be heading toward Miami, possibly traveling
together. The notice said the occupants were to be considered armed
and dangerous.
   A third car, a tan Buick sedan registered to a 24-year-old woman
who lived at the address where the shootings took place, was found
at the scene with blood stains on it.
   Seely said all the victims were in their early 30s and each was
shot at least once.
   ``All of the victims were found nude, hands and feet tied and
gagged,'' Seely said. ``All victims were shot in the head with a
medium caliber pistol.''
   Seely said there was no forced entry, but could not say if the
victims knew the attackers.
   He had no comment on reports that at least one victim also was
stabbed.
   He also would not identify the person who reported the shooting,
and declined to say whether drugs or other evidence of narcotics
dealing were found at the scene.
   But authorities said the slayings are believed to be
drug-related because they were done execution-style.
   The neighbor said residents of both units in the duplex where
the shooting occurred often went from one to the other. She said
they had lived there about a year and kept to themselves.
   The people in the unit adjacent to where the shooting took place
had children, the neighbor said. Seely refused comment on that
report as well.

   Mitsubishi Corp. is recalling 100,000 cars to
bring carbon monoxide emissions below federal standards, the
Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday.
   The cars are the 1984 Dodge Colt, Plymouth Colt and the
Mitsubishi Precis, all equipped with the 1.4-liter (85 cubic
inches) engine, and the 1985 Dodge Colt, Plymouth Colt and
Mitsubishi Mirage, all equipped with the 1.5-liter (91 cubic
inches) engine. Models sold in California are not affected.
   The 1984 Precis was sold only in Puerto Rico.
   Dodge and Plymouth dealers will handle repairs to cars bearing
those names and Mitsubishi dealers will handle the cars bearing
their name.
   Dealers will modify the exhaust air injection system,
recalibrate automatic chokes, adjust the exhaust gas recirculation
system and, for the 1984 models, install a new carburetor main air
jet, EPA said.

   The newspaper As-Safir published on
Tuesday messages addressed to British hostage John McCarthy from
his relatives and friends.
   ``Darling John, longing to have you home again. Thinking of you
every second. Keep your spirits up,'' said one of the messages
published in English by the Arabic-language daily. It was signed,
``Love, mother and father.''
   McCarthy, 31, of London, a journalist for the London-based
Worldwide Television Network, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut
on April 17, 1986.
   No group claimed his abduction.
   Another message signed Chris Pearson said: ``Stay cheerful, my
friend. Just want you to know that I love and I miss you.''
   The third message from his fiancee ``Jill,'' said: ``Darling
John, longing to see your smile again.''
   The last message, ``from friends of John McCarthy,'' read,
``Hope it won't be long now.''
   McCarthy is one of 17 foreigners missing in Lebanon and believed
kidnapped.
   The others are nine Americans, two other Britons, an Irishman,
an Italian, an Indian and two unidentified men.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest held hostage. He was kidnapped in
Beirut on March 16, 1985.

   State game officials confiscated
and killed a crow that was being kept illegally by a teen-ager who
nursed the animal back to health after it lost a wing.
   Arizona law prohibits keeping migratory birds as pets.
   Steve Luenz Jr., 13, was given the bird 2{ years ago by a
neighbor who said vacationers picked it up along the highway after
it collided with a tractor-trailer rig. Another family took the
bird to a veterinarian, who amputated a mangled wing.
   Luenz said game warden Dana McGehee told him in July the crow
would be confiscated and taken to the state Game and Fish
Department sanctuary at Adobe Mountain.
   ``He told us he would be taken care of out there and that we
could go out and see him whenever we wanted to,'' Luenz said.
   The bird was killed ``because we had no place to put it and it
couldn't be returned to the wild,'' said Robin Spahr, a worker at
the Adobe Mountain facility.
   McGehee was not available for comment Tuesday, but his
supervisor said it was unlikely McGehee would have made such a
statement.
   ``We don't have control over what they do with the animals,''
said McGehee's supervisor, Ray Kohls. ``I wasn't aware it was
killed.''

<HEAD>Anti-Gun Group Says Semiautomatic and Automatic Assault Weapons on
Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The popularity of semiautomatic or automatic
assault weapons is increasing dramatically among criminals,
especially among those trafficking in illegal drugs, an anti-gun
group said Tuesday.
   The group said police officials across the country are concerned
about how frequently criminals are found to possess high-powered
automatic assault rifles or shotguns _ some capable of firing 30
rounds in a few seconds.
   ``The number of assault weapons in civilian hands _ both
criminal and law abiding _ is estimated to be in the hundreds of
thousands, perhaps millions,'' said a report by the Education Fund
to End Handgun Violence, which keeps track of the firearms industry
and favors tighter controls over the sale of guns.
   The group said there are no nationwide statistics available on
the misuse of such assault weapons, but that police organizations,
government agencies and pro-gun control groups agree the number of
such weapons has increased dramatically in recent years.
   Assault weapons are characterized by having the capability of
firing a large number of rounds on a single magazine, great muzzle
velocity and compact design often including folding stocks that
make it easier for the weapon to be concealed.
   The assault weapons ``are quickly becoming the leading topic in
America's gun control debate and will most likely remain the
leading gun control issue for the near future,'' the report said.
   It said automatic and semiautomatic weapons such as the AR-15,
AK-47 and Uzi are among the most popular weapons of drug dealers
and are readily available in most states.
   ``For criminals, the weapons look intimidating, have increased
firepower, and can be purchased under the same controls as a
hunting rifle or shotgun,'' the report said. It said the weapons
are popular not only among criminals, but also survivalists and
``rank-and-file gun aficionados.''
   While the group said no national statistics were available on
how many such weapons are in circulation, it said in 1987, almost
one-third of the weapons seized by the Drug Enforcement Agency were
semiautomatic and 16 percent were fully automatic.
   Of the 388 guns seized by the Washington D.C. police department
during the first six weeks of this year, ``the vast majority were
either semiautomatic or fully automatic,'' the report said.
   The study was conducted in conjunction with the New Right Watch,
a group which monitors right wing organizations.

   One hundred members of Congress have signed an
appeal to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in an
effort to halt ``mass executions of political prisoners'' in Iran,
a spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``The dramatic increase in mass executions of political
prisoners and public hangings of innocent people in Iran, as
reported by the international press as well as the (opposition)
People's Mujahedeen of Iran, has shocked the world,'' the letter
said.
   It said the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had
``extensively violated'' the Charter of the United Nations, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International
Covenants on Human Rights, staging 70,000 executions since 1981,
and that a further 140,000 lives were in danger.
   ``We urge you immediately do everything possible to halt the
continuing arrests and executions (and) to send a mission to
Iranian prisons and torture chambers to investigate these reports
... ,'' it added.
   A spokesman for Rep. Mervin Dymally, D-Calif., said 60
Democratic and 40 Republican House members had signed the appeal by
Tuesday afternoon but said that it was possible more would sign
before the letter was sent on Thursday.

Confrontation</HEAD>

   The Justice Department announced Tuesday there
is insufficient evidence to seek indictments in the investigation
of action taken by Philadelphia city officials and police in the
1985 MOVE confrontation, which left 11 people dead and nearly two
square blocks in flames.
   The investigation examined whether the officials or police
violated the civil rights of those who died in the bombing and
ensuing fire, said Assistant Attorney General William Bradford
Reynolds.
   ``We ... just found insufficient evidence to go forward with an
indictment of anybody,'' Reynolds, head of the department's civil
rights division, said in an interview.
   It was the second time a criminal probe of Philadelphia Mayor
Wilson Goode and others in connection with the MOVE incident has
been concluded without indictments. A local grand jury in
Philadelphia earlier this year strongly criticized city officials
for their handling of the confrontation.
   Refraining from extensive comment, Goode said he was happy that
the investigation was over, adding: ``Two grand juries have fully
investigated this matter and have reached a point of no criminality
involved. For that I am pleased.''
   The local grand jury discounted assertions that police gunfire
in an alley behind the MOVE compound kept people from fleeing the
burning rowhouse and Reynolds said the federal probe also had
examined that aspect of the matter.
   In a three-paragraph statement announcing the end of the federal
probe, the department said no report will be issued by the fderal
grand jury in Philadelphia which has been looking into the matter
since April 1987.
   The panel based its inquiry on the work of an FBI investigation
launched in July 1985.
   ``It is a very positive thing ... to look forward rather than to
look back ... and it really serves no purpose to go back and
revisit and re-churn those waters,'' Reynolds said when asked why
the government had decided not to press for a grand jury report on
the matter. ``I feel quite strongly that the proper way for a
prosecutor to proceed is to make his or her decision,'' announce it
and ``nothing (is) to be served by any commentary after that.''
   Reynolds praised the FBI, said the statements of more than 250
witnesses had been carefully considered and that ``we are satisfied
... there is no basis for a criminal indictment based on our
thorough review of all the evidence.''
   Five children and six adults died inside the barricaded west
Philadelphia rowhouse on May 13, 1985, when police dropped a bomb
on the dwelling in an attempt to evict MOVE followers. Philadelphia
Mayor Wilson Goode approved the use of a bomb, which contained the
powerful military explosive C-4 and was dropped from a helicopter.
   The police bomb touched off a rooftop fire that soon raged out
of control while fireman held back, afraid they would be hit by
gunfire that had echoed through the neighborhood. The fire engulfed
almost two square blocks and destroyed 61 rowhouses.
   Members of the mysterious MOVE group, whose name did not stand
for anything in particular, championed back-to-nature rituals,
lived in filth, refused to send their children to school, and
openly disobeyed health and safety laws.
   Neighbors had complained to city officials and threatened to
take matters into their own hands if nothing was done about MOVE.
   An investigating commission said the group ``had evolved into an
authoritarian, violence-threatening cult.''
   Philadelphia District Attorney Ronald Castille said at the time
the local grand jury report came out that it ``laid to rest the
MOVE commission's finding and other allegations that police gunfire
prevented MOVE members from fleeing the burning compound'' through
the back alley.
   The local grand jury said it considered but discarded charges of
conspiracy, murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault,
reckless endangerment, arson, causing or risking a catastrophe,
failure to prevent a catastrophe, criminal mischief and perjury.
   Only two people escaped from the house _ a female MOVE member
known as Ramona Africa and then-13-year-old Michael Moses Ward,
known to MOVE members as Birdie Africa. All MOVE members adopted
the surname Africa and most of them were black.
   A Philadelphia policeman was killed in a 1978 confrontation with
MOVE members.

   Western opinion polls showing hostility toward
nuclear weapons and rising popularity for Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev present a challenge for NATO to better explain and sell
its basic defense policy, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne
Ridgway said Tuesday.
   ``For all of these (NATO) countries, it means a requirement for
explaining defense policy and ... the approach to dealing with the
Soviet Union'' from a position of strength, she told a
Congressional hearing. ``Arms control negotiations to achieve a
proper defense at the lowest possible level require a very long and
elaborate public presentation.''
   Ms. Ridgway termed startling and a matter of concern the results
of an opinion survey two months ago by a leading European
newspaper, West Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., told the House subcommittee on
European and Middle Eastern Affairs that the poll showed Gorbachev
was popular with 70 percent of the West Germans questioned, that 79
percent opposed nuclear weapons in Europe and 51 percent rejected
the idea of nuclear deterrents.
   ``We are also seeing the results of other polls that were very
hostile,'' Ms. Ridgway said, adding that such sentiments seem not
limited to particular age groups. ``It creates problems for all of
us. Some of those attitudes are present in our own country,
probably in the same proportions,'' she said.
   Hamilton gave no information on the number polled or margin of
error in the July 22 opinion survey. He also said 68 percent of the
West Germans questioned opposed modernization of nuclear forces and
only 14 percent favored it, that ``mistrust of the Soviet Union has
almost vanished and there is growing acceptance in Germany of
Gorbachev's claims that Soviet military power is for defense rather
than offensive purposes.''

   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn announced the formation of
an advisory panel Tuesday, a move School Committee members charge
is an attempt by City Hall to take over operation of the city's 120
public schools.
   The mayor denied the panel is a power play for control of the
system, which has come under criticism.
   The commission includes educators, business community leaders,
two city councilors, and state Higher Education Commissioner
Franklyn Jenifer. The panel will advise Flynn on such issues as
educational policy, a student assignment plan, teacher morale and
school governance, the mayor said.
   School Committee President John Nucci said the mayor, considered
a likely candidate for governor in 1990, is moving to take over the
schools and enhance his image for a possible gubernatorial bid.
   ``I don't think anyone should kid themselves into thinking this
isn't politically motivated,'' Nucci said. ``The mayor is looking
to a governor's campaign, and he would like to crisscross the state
and say he did something about schools.''
   The mayor denied the accusation.
   ``I don't think there's anybody in the city of Boston who's
satisfied with the level of the education,'' Flynn said. ``Public
education is not the domain of the school committee or the
superintendent of schools alone, it's a city problem. ... We all
have a vested interest in public education in Boston.''
   Committee member Juanita Wade, who has been invited to sit on
the panel, said public concerns that the school system is not doing
all it can to improve education are not new, ``So this blue-ribbon
panel is not sending any different message than isn't out there
already,'' she said.

<HEAD>Armenians Strike As Annexation Demands Are Renewed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material and editing throughout UPDATE with report on big

   An Armenian activist said about 400,000 people
jammed the main square of Yerevan Tuesday night and heard renewed
demands for Armenian annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, where reports
said a curfew was imposed and a bomb damaged a workers' dormitory.
   New violence hit the disputed territory over the weekend, with
one man said to have been killed and at least 25 people officially
reported injured.
   The Armenian activist, Rafael Popoyan, said many residents in
the Armenian capital who struck last Friday remained off the job
Tuesday, vowing to stay out until the Armenian Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, met in new session to reconsider their annexation plea.
   In a telephone interview from Yerevan on Tuesday, Popoyan said
members of the Karabakh Committee, a group pressing for annexation
of Nagorno-Karabakh, told the Yerevan crowd that one-third, or 115
members, of the republic's Supreme Soviet signed a request for a
new session.
   ``At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, people will be on the square
waiting for an official announcement,'' Popoyan said. He said that
according to law, the session must be held if one-third of the
Supreme Soviet members request it.
   Popoyan said committee members also told the crowd that a curfew
was in effect in Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Popoyan, a 46-year-old former political prisoner, said he had no
details.
   The predominantly Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, a
mountainous region of the republic of Azerbaijan, began agitating
in February for annexation to Armenia. Ethnic riots broke out in
Sumgait, an industrial city of Azerbaijan, at the end of February,
that left at least 32 people dead.
   The area, in the southern Soviet region near the Turkish-Iranian
border, has been tense since then. According to the official Tass
news agency, Armenians and Azerbaijanis traded shots Sunday in
Khadzhaly village in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   An editor at the official news agency Azerinform in Azerbaijan
said in a telephone interview that a 61-year-old carpenter injured
in the clash died Monday in a hospital. The editor, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said he did not know whether the man was an
Armenian or an Azerbaijani.
   Tass said 25 people were hurt in the fighting, but Popoyan said
reports in Yerevan reported up to 70 injured.
   Popoyan and Dmitri Volchek, an editor of the unofficial Moscow
journal Glasnost, said a bomb exploded Monday at a dormitory
housing Armenian construction workers in Abovyan, a few miles from
Stepanakert.
   Popoyan said no one was hurt. He said a leaflet found at the
site called the blast a ``present to residents of Karabakh.''
   Calls did not go through to Stepanakert. Operators said the
telephone line was down.
   In a possible prelude to greater police activity in Armenia and
Azerbaijan, Tass called for order. ``The people are demanding that
law and order be enforced everywhere. Law-enforcement services
along with the public are taking necessary measures,'' it said.
   Officials in Yerevan said police patrols were increased, but
Popoyan said police made no effort to break up the meeting Tuesday
night.
   The Armenian parliament in June asked the national Supreme
Soviet to permit Armenia to annex Nagorno-Karabakh. The central
government rejected that demand and offered instead a plan of
social and economic development.
   Tass said many workers were showing restraint, ensuring normal
operation of farms, transportation and factories, ``but all the
same, irresponsible elements, first of all in the Nagorno-Karabakh
autonomous region, continue working up tension, provoking disorders
and resorting to arson and other illegal activities.''
   Popoyan said stores, farms, food processing plants and
transportation were operating in Yerevan, but many other
enterprises and schools were closed.
   He estimated that 1 million people attended a Monday night
gathering in Yerevan. A duty officer at the Armenian Ministry of
Internal Affairs said more than 250,000 people attended.
   Tass said several meetings were held in Azerbaijan as well.
   A new strike was called last week in Stepanakert, where workers
were off their jobs for weeks during the summer.
   In Baku on Tuesday, the Azerbaijani Communist Party chief,
Abdul-Rahman Vezirov, told a meeting of local officials the clashes
were part of ``anti-social activities'' that must be combated with
work among the people and stricter control over law-and-order, Tass
reported.
   Armenians are predominantly Christian; most Azerbaijanis are
Shiite Moslem. Armenians also differ linguistically and culturally
from ethnic Azerbaijanis.

<TEXT>
   A Notre Dame instructor says he will
continue using his flaming-hand magic trick as an audience
attention-grabber even though he set a small blaze in a classroom.
   ``When was the last time you set your audience on fire?''
adjunct professor G. Herb True joked Tuesday.
   No one was hurt in the incident Monday in a classroom at the
University of Notre Dame Center for Continuing Education.
   He was giving a seminar to a group from the American Amusement
and Music Operators Association when, to liven things up, he used
his magic skills to produce a small ball of fire in the palm of his
hand.
   Someone distracted his attention, his hand got burned and he
accidently hit a flip chart. The pages caught fire, and flames
reached the ceiling before the fire was extinguished.
   Aside from a small area of burned carpet and a light film of
smoke inside the building, there was no damage, said Michael
Garvey, assistant director for public information.
   ``I have a number of magic tricks,'' True said in a telephone
interview. ``And I have this thing that I flip with my finger and
this flame comes out of my hand. At least it looks like it.
   ``It wasn't much of a fire, really. But a guy comes in and tries
to put it out and he starts fanning the flames.''
   The fire was finally put out with the aid of a pitcher of water
and a fire extinguisher.
   True said he plans to do the trick twice Wednesday at seminars
in Indianapolis.

   NASA's inspector general said Tuesday he
expects more indictments charging aerospace manufacturers with
certifying falsely that bolts used on the space shuttles had been
properly tested.
   Bill Colvin said he had been assured by engineers that there are
no defective bolts in critical areas on the shuttle Discovery,
which is to be launched Sept. 29 from the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida.
   ``We are looking at false certification,'' he said. ``That does
not necessarily mean they are defective.''
   The Los Angeles Times quoted Darrell Lee, president of Lee
Aerospace Products of Simi Valley, Calif., as saying his company is
one of many under investigation.
   Colvin said it would not be appropriate for him to discuss Lee
Aerospace. No charges have been filed against the firm.
   ``At this point in time our interest is in fasteners,'' Colvin
said. ``I would expect more indictments.''
   Ron Bledsoe, chief of the quality engineering division at the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the false
certifications were uncovered during an audit in February and March.
   ``There are some of Lee Aerospace's bolts on the shuttle, we
know that,'' he said. ``We've actually gone in and evaluated where
these bolts were and in any critical application, we conducted
extensive stress analysis and determined there was no safety
issue.''
   Bledsoe said the shuttle's right booster contains 614 Lee bolts
and the left booster has 595 and that Lee bolts account for 60
percent of the 2,000 bolts inside the rockets.
   ``Even with those bolts that were in there, I couldn't say we
would have a problem with them,'' Bledsoe said. ``But they just
didn't meet all the requirement we have. We want to assure
ourselves all bases are covered.''
   Arthur O. Sammons of Canoga Park, Calif., was indicted Sept. 9
by a federal grand jury in Birmingham, Ala., on 26 counts of making
false statements to NASA and 17 counts of mail fraud involving
shuttle bolts made by Lawrence Engineering and Supply of Burbank,
Calif.
   In the Sammons case, federal authorities said the cost of
identifying and removing the suspect bolts was $1 million, an
estimate that Colvin called conservative. Sammons faces up to five
years in prison and a fine of $10,000 each on the false statement
counts and five years and $1,000 fines on each count of mail fraud.
   Bledsoe said 357 bolts were taken off the two booster rockets in
May or June, all made by Lawrence Engineering. He said no defective
bolts were found among those tested.
   ``There are military specifications that set the standard for
bolts,'' Colvin said. ``Some bolts must meet a certain threshold or
be able to withstand certain pressures. Others might have to meet
certain chemical specifications so they don't rust and deteriorate.
The testing is done either by the manufacturer or supplier and they
certify to us that this has been done.''

<HEAD>Educators Discuss Formation and Propagation of Curriculum on King
Holiday</HEAD>

   Educators gathered Tuesday to grapple with the
practical and philosophical problems that would confront teachers
in developing a kindergarten-12th grade curriculum on the national
holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``If we teach the principles of nonviolent social change to the
kids from kindergarten, what do we do when they stage a walkout?''
one educator asked.
   The answer, from Harold Sims of the Atlanta-based Martin Luther
King Center for Non-Violent Social Change: ``You have to teach them
the principles of non-violent social change, let them know that
civil disobedience was the last step following long period of
negotiation.''
   Teaching dilemmas, parental reaction, lack of course materials,
training and faculty support were some of the issues raised during
the mini-convention on ``Infusing Educational Materials Related to
Martin Luther King Jr., into the Curriculum of the Nation's
Schools'' sponsored by the Education Committee of the Federal
Holiday Commission and the King center.
   Committee members included National Education Association
President Mary Futrell; Sister Catherine McNamee, president of the
National Catholic Educational Association; Manya Ungar, president
of the National Parents and Teachers Association; Lawrence
Davenport, assistant secretary of the Department of Energy, and
Mrs. Christine King Farris, King's sister.
   Saying she hoped this would be ``the first of many,''
conferences designed to make available audio-visual materials,
training programs and other classroom aids, Futrell said, ``You
cannot simply go out and say `I'm going to teach about the life of
Dr. King' unless you know about his life, unless you understand and
have resources available.''
   Futrell said the purpose of the convention was to give the
participants an opportunity to come together and ``talk about how
we teach about King and how we inculcate that into the curriculum.''
   Many of the speakers discussed the problems associated with
their particular constituent groups.
   ``One problem is that no one has ever been really taught about
King,'' said Gordon Ambach of the Council of Chief State School
Officers.
   ``You have to recognize that an association like mine is _
predominantly white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, middle class and
suburban,'' said Ungar of the national PTA.
   ``The board members with which I deal ... are not reflective of
the greater society _ particularly that portion of society which
increasingly has problems getting their voices heard and their
agenda addressed,'' she said.
   She noted that her group was reaching out to other
organizations, such as the Anti-Defamation League, to help produce
literature by next June.
   The PTA board, which prepared itself through training in human
relation skills and a task force for inclusiveness, suggested that
the state and local chapters initiate programs which ``demonstrate
a commitment to the things that Martin Luther King espoused and
stood for,'' she said.
   ``To do this, the parents have got to educate themselves and
find out who Martin Luther King was,'' Ungar said. ``We hope to
have literature aimed at the parents, talking about how we either
overtly or covertly teach prejudice, teach racism or perpetuate
this cycle of hatred and violence,'' she said.

   A Roman Catholic priest who was
arrested on suspicion of distributing subversive literature was
deported to the United States, police sources said Tuesday.
   The Rev. Albert Reymann, 70, who had worked in Honduras for
seven years, left for Miami on Monday following his arrest Sept. 14.
   ``I am being watched since they arrested me illegally and I
don't want any other problems,'' newspapers quoted Reymann as
telling reporters at the airport.
   Reymann said military authorities had told him not to make any
public statements. He gave a victory sign before boarding a
commercial flight to Miami, newspapers said.
   Honduran authorities held the Maryknoll priest for 10 hours
before releasing him to the bishop of San Pedro Sula. He was kept
under house arrest. No details on the charges against him were
given.
   Sources said Reymann was arrested as he left a union meeting in
San Pedro Sula, but no other details were available.
   The sources said his case is not related to the arrest of 16
Americans in Honduras following protests Sept. 14 in front of the
U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa and the U.S. air base in Palmerola. The
protesters were demonstrating against U.S. military policy in
Central America and were deported last Saturday.
   The protests were organized by a group called Project
Independence and held one day before Central American countries
celebrate the anniversary of their independence from Spain in 1821.

<HEAD>Stanford Classics Professor Emeritus, Guggenheim Fellow Dies At 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lionel I.C. Pearson, a classical scholar
who won a prestigious Guggenheim fellowship and wrote more than a
dozen books, has died of pancreatic cancer. He was 80.
   Pearson, professor emeritus of classics at Stanford University,
died Sunday at Sharon Heights Convalescent Hospital in Menlo Park.
   He was a graduate of Trinity College, Oxford, and Yale
University and taught at Stanford from 1940 to 1973, except for a
three-year stint with the British Army Intelligence Corps ending in
1946.
   Pearson, working with colleagues, had just completed his latest
book, ``Aristoxenus: The Elements of Harmony,'' a discussion of
ancient Greek music theory to be published by Oxford University
Press.
   ``He was among the most distinguished scholars our department
ever had,'' said professor Mark Edwards. ``His life was devoted to
the service of classics in the widest sense: teaching, research and
support of his fellow classicists.''
   Born in London, Pearson taught Greek and classics at the
University of Glasgow, Dalhousie University, Yale and the New York
State College of Teachers before moving to Stanford.
   He was named a Guggenheim fellow in 1957-58.
   Among his recent books were ``The Greek Historians of the West:
Timaeus and His Predecessors,'' published last year; ``The
Commentary of Didymus on Demosthenes,'' published in 1983 by
Teubner Press, West Germany; and ``The Art of Demosthenes,''
published by the American Philological Association in 1976.
   Pearson also wrote ``Plutarch: On the Malice of Herodotus,''
``Popular Ethics in Ancient Greece'' and ``The Lost Histories of
Alexander The Great.''
   Survivors include his brother, Michael, and two sisters, Madge
McKee and Clair Pearson, all of England. Pearson's wife, Doris, was
killed in a car accident in 1964. They had no children.

   A man who recovered from a brain tumor and the
amputation of his leg following a battle with the cancer that
claimed the lives of all his male family members was sworn in to
the Florida bar Tuesday.
   Stephen Southerland, 28, stood on one leg and metal crutches,
smiling proudly as he recited the oath of admission before U.S.
District Judge Eugene P. Spellman.
   ``I am proud to welcome you as a member of the legal
fraternity,'' Spellman said, stepping down from the bench to shake
the jubilant Southerland's hand.
   An apparent genetic defect is responsible for the cancer that
has followed the Southerlands for at least four generations, the
family's physician, Dr. Beatrice Lampkin, said earlier this year.
   Southerland's brother Jeffrey died of leukemia in 1967 at age 4.
His father, Raymond Southerland, 43, died of a brain tumor in 1981,
and his brother Michael, 16, died of a rare spinal cancer later
that year. The only other family survivor is his mother, Jane
Southerland-McMillen.
   Southerland was hopeful he had the cancer beat after his left
leg was amputated in 1974. He dreamed of becoming a lawyer and
began studying for the bar exam in 1986.
   Then he suffered a seizure and collapsed during a softball game.
Doctors found a golfball-sized malignant brain tumor lodged deep in
the left side of his brain and decided to operate.
   ``It was the best excuse in the world not to take a bar exam,''
he joked at the time.
   The operation removed any trace of cancer, doctors told him.
Southerland began working full time at a Miami law firm and lifting
weights three times a week to regain his strength. He took the bar
exam in Tampa on July 26 and 27.
   ``At 9:30 on Monday, I learned I passed the bar,'' Southerland
said after his swearing-in. ``A friend of mine who's a clerk at the
Supreme Court called me to tell me.''
   Handling his crutches with ease, Southerland hugged his mother
and his stepfather and thanked the small crowd of friends for their
support over the years.
   The judge, who like Southerland is a University of Florida
graduate, said he was impressed by Southerland's courage when they
met at a Christmas party last year. He promised then to officiate
at Southerland's swearing-in if he passed the bar.
   Southerland said his plans to practice civil law have put his
social life on the back burner.
   ``Right now all I'm concentrating on is my law career,'' he said.

   Foreign Minister Dante M. Caputo of
Argentina was elected president of the 43rd General Assembly
Tuesday and promptly denounced developed nations for their
``pitiless system'' of piling up Third World debt.
   Caputo was swiftly elected after the 159-nation world body
convened in a mood of optimism and conciliation over many
international issues, despite the bitter presidential contest
between Caputo and Barbados' ambassador to the U.N., Dame Nita
Barrow.
   In his inaugural speech, Caputo set the tone for his yearlong
presidency of the world body which is dominated by poor, developing
nations and distanced himself from much of the industrialized West.
   Caputo cited ``the contrast between political peace and economic
injustice ... the widening of the gap between rich countries and a
large part of the developing world.''
   The 47-year-old former professor and politician was elected by a
vote of 91 to 66, with one abstention in secret balloting by 158
nations. South Africa, the 159th member, is disqualified from
voting. The abstaining nation was not identified.
   The post is largely ceremonial but the president has great
prestige and can wield considerable influence in setting agendas,
limiting speeches and setting the tone for debate.
   Caputo's election was a major setback for Britain, which lobbied
against him and for Dame Nita. Britain and Argentina were foes in
the Falklands War of 1982 _ won by Britain _ and the General
Assembly consistently has taken Argentina's side.
   The race was expected to be close, but Caputo won handily over
the 71-year-old nurse and public health expert who became the
Barbados envoy in 1986.
   The United States did not disclose its secret vote.
   Diplomatic sources said Caputo, who had been courting black
Africa, won many votes in the non-aligned movement. He also won
votes of the Soviet Union and socialist countries; Cuba; Japan;
Arab nations, which need Argentine food, and some European nations
which have emigrant ties to Argentina, the sources said.
   Caputo, named foreign minister in 1983 by President Raul
Alfonsin, last month expelled South Africa's consul for organizing
a conference in Argentina without proper diplomatic clearance.
   In his speech after Tuesday's election, Caputo praised the
improved atmosphere for international cooperation betwen East and
West.
   Caputo cited U.N. achievements in the Iran-Iraq cease-fire,
Afghanistan settlement, Western Sahara and other areas. He also
denounced the continuing ``infamous practice of apartheid in South
Africa,'' refering to that country's policy of racial segregation.
   He pointed to the ``sharp deterioration of the situation'' in
Israeli-occupied territories. He called for an international peace
conference on the Middle East and supported the right of all states
in the region to exist within safe boundaries and the right of the
Palestinian people to self-determination.
   But he reserved his strongest comments to condemn the economic
gap between the industrialized and the developing world.
   Caputo noted ``the remarkable difference between all the
progress made toward ensuring world peace and the little, or
nothing we have done to prevent the widening of the gap between
rich countries, and a large part of the developing world.''
   He said one of the clearest examples ``of this impotence is the
question of the external debt of the developing countries: No
structural improvement has taken place for the debtors since the
outbreak of the the crisis in 1982.''
   The Argentine envoy warned that high interst rates, ``together
with the pitiless system of successive refinancing plans, and the
perverse outflow of financial resources of indebted countries to
credtors will end up eliminatng possibilities of investment for the
developing world.''
   Argentina has a foreign debt of $56 billion, the third highest
in the developing world.
   Of the three sources of global conflict _ East-West tension,
regional conflicts and the ``unfair relationship between North and
South'' _ a major U.N. effort must be directed toward helping the
developing world, Caputo said.
   He said Northern nations ensured their own wealth by imposing
poverty on developing nations, but emphasized that the
industrialized nations need the development of other nations to
consolidate their own progress.
   ``They need it,'' he said, ``because development guarantees
peace in the Third World and global security and because expansion
of trade of developed countries will depend increasingly on growth
of economies of the South.''

   Resumption of suspended negotiations on the
future of U.S. military bases in Greece could depend on the Greek
foreign minister's planned talks here Wednesday with Secretary of
State George Shultz, a senior Shultz aide said Tuesday.
   Foreign Minister Carolas Papoulias is scheduled to meet and have
lunch with Shultz in his capacity as current representative of the
European Common Market, but U.S.-Greek relations also will be
covered, Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway told a
congressional panel.
   Negotiations in Athens on American military bases were suspended
Sept. 5 when Ambassador Alan Flanigan, the U.S. negotiator,
returned to Washington for instructions on a ``major element'' in
the Greek position. That was identified as a demand for U.S. forces
to vacate Hellenikon air base at Athens International Airport, Ms.
Ridgway said.
   Resumption was tentatively scheduled for October, but the date
is undecided and ``whether it takes place'' depends partly on talks
with Papoulias, she told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
European and Middle Eastern Affairs.
   ``The disposition of Hellenikon will have to be resolved ... how
it is going to be dealt with affects the whole negotiations,'' she
said.
   Ms. Ridgway did not disclose the U.S. response to the demand for
its planes to leave Hellenikon. She said in answer to a question
that if agreement cannot be reached, ``we have procedures for
leaving'' but ``we are not at any stage of starting that at this
time.''
   Subcommittee Chairman Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., asked if the illness
of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, reported to be facing heart
surgery, would affect the base negotiations. The Greek government
has said repeatedly that foreign policy is unaffected by
Papandreou's illness and officials have been instructed to carry on
their functions, Ms. Ridgway replied.
   As to whether the base negotiations would be completed before
parliamentary elections, she said this was uncertain because
setting of the election date is linked to the prime minister's
health.
   Ms. Ridgway was also asked about the status of U.S. military
bases in Turkey, covered by an agreement that runs into 1990.
   ``We are prepared to negotiate with Turkey on the renewal of
that agreement in good order,'' she said. ``I think it is a good
agreement. We are happy with it, Turkey is happy with it as far as
I know.''
   Ms. Ridgway praised the rival Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
leaders for meeting in Geneva and Nicosia under U.N. auspices in
August and September and agreeing to meet again.
   ``We continue to support strongly a negotiated settlement of the
Cyprus problem,'' she said, declaring that U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar ``enjoys our full support.''
   Asked to explain what members of Congress termed ``conflicting
U.S. and Turkish reports'' about Iraqi use of poison gas against
the Kurdish minority in Iraq, Ms. Ridgway said most of the Kurds
who managed to reach Turkey were those who escaped the attacks,
while the U.S. findings were based partly on evidence not available
to Turkey.
   Asked if Turkey were barring U.N. experts from investigating the
issue, she said the whole matter was under discussion and not yet
resolved.

   Showers were scattered across much of the eastern part of the
nation Tuesday and in parts of the Rockies as well.
   Showers, combined with a few thunderstorms, were scattered along
a warm front crossing western New England, and along a cold front
crossing the upper Ohio Valley. Cloudy skies and widely scattered
showers prevailed in the rest of the area from south-central Texas
across the central Gulf Coast states to the Atlantic Coast.
   In the West, a slow-moving cold front produced a few showers in
the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah and the central Rockies,
and an upper-level disturbance brought a few showers to the
southern Rockies.
   Heavier rain totals for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
0.48 inch at Morgantown, W.Va.; 0.40 inch at Pittsburgh and at
Watertown, N.Y.; 0.32 inch at Pensacola, Fla.; and 0.30 inch at Du
Bois, Pa.
   Strong northwest winds continued to usher cool air into the Ohio
Valley, the Great Lakes region and the middle and upper Mississippi
Valley, while brisk southerly winds prevailed ahead of a cold
front, from New England to North Carolina.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 40
degrees at Cutbank, Mont., to 95 degrees at Phoenix. The
early-morning low for the nation Tuesday was 15 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   The national forecast for Wednesday called for widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms across a far-flung area from the central
and eastern Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic Coast to eastern
New York state and New England. Widely scattered showers also were
forecast across the northern Plains and from the Great Basin across
Arizona and southwestern new Mexico.
   Highs in the 90s were forecast in Florida and much of the
southern Plains and lower Mississippi Valley; in the 80s in the
central Plains to the southern and middle Atlantic Coast; in the
60s from Upper Michigan to eastern Montana, the northern Plateau,
the Great Basin and the northern and central Rockies; and in the
70s across most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Dukakis Still Unknown Among Voters, Survey Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis is still unknown to many voters despite more than a year of
campaigning, says an ABC News-Washington Post poll released Tuesday.
   The survey, which gave Republican George Bush a 50 percent to 46
percent lead over Dukakis, said 54 percent of the respondents
thought they did not know enough about Dukakis. That compared with
70 percent who said they think the vice president is a known
quantity.
   The survey of 1,271 likely voters, begun a week ago and
concluded Monday, also found that Bush was favored over Dukakis
among voters who consider themselves independents. The survey had a
margin of error of plus or minus three points.
   The survey also examined which issues were important to voters
and how strong they considered each candidate on those issues.
   According to the survey, six out of ten respondents considered
holding down taxes to be a very important issue, and of that group
54 percent thought Bush would do a better job while 43 percent
thought Dukakis would.
   Of the two-thirds of the respondents who thought preserving
American family values to be a ``cutting edge'' issue, 52 percent
supported Bush and 44 percent supported Dukakis.
   But on the issue of creating new jobs, which two-thirds found
important, Dukakis was favored over Bush 53 percent to 43 percent.
   Neither candidate led on fighting drugs and crime, holding down
the deficit and protecting the environment. Bush was ahead among
voters who were concerned about issues such as the Pledge of
Allegiance, the Strategic Defense Initiative and anti-abortion
legislation, while Dukakis was favored by those who consider
college aid and child care to be important issues.
   A week ago, an ABC News-Washington Post poll gave Dukakis a
48-45 lead. That survey also had a three-point margin of error.

   Afghanistan rebels fired a rocket
into Kabul on Tuesday that killed at least 62 people and injured
104, Radio Kabul said.
   In Moscow, the official Soviet news agency Tass said two
terrorists preparing a bomb for an act of sabotage in another
Afghan city were killed when the device exploded. A 9-year-old girl
also died in the explosion, it said.
   ``As a result of the attack (on Kabul) 62 innocent people,
including women and children, were killed and 104 were wounded,''
Radio Kabul said in a report monitored in Islamabad. It gave few
other details.
   The report tended to reinforce claims by Western sources that
U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents have surrounded the heavily-fortified
Afghan capital, attacking government and Soviet-held positions.
   In another report Tuesday, Radio Kabul said 10 people were
killed when six surface rockets ``launched by extremist opposition
elements'' slammed into various parts of Kabul. It was not
immediately clear whether the 10 fatalities were included among the
62 reported killed.
   The report said since the April 14 signing in Geneva of an
accord providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan, anti-communist rebels have rocketed the city 16 times.
The 16th attack occurred Tuesday, it said.
   Tass also reported Tuesday that Afghan soldiers captured 14
caches of arms near Kabul that contained more than 700
surface-to-air missiles.
   Afghan soldiers moved into Lalnadar Gorge, about 12 miles south
of Kabul, after they received intelligence about the arms supplies
hidden there, Tass said.
   Two battalions of Afghan soldiers, supported by Soviet
artillery, cut off roads leading out of the gorge, but most of the
rebels escaped via mountain paths, it said.
   ``In all, Afghan troops discovered 14 depots containing 724
surface-to-air missiles, 132 anti-tank and 280 anti-personnel
mines, U.S.-made remote-control explosive devices and other
weapons,'' Tass said.
   Also discovered were submachine guns, grenades, bazookas, and an
anti-aircraft gun on a rotating platform, it said.
   It said the rebels launched missiles at Kabul from a nearby
mountain ridge, and then scattered because of retaliatory strikes
that usually followed. It was not clear if the attack reported by
Tass was the same offensive reported Tuesday by Radio Kabul.
   Tass also did not say when the weapons were captured from the
insurgents, who are seeking to oust the Soviet-backed government of
President Najib.
   Tass quoted the Afghan news agency Bakhtar as saying the
accidental bombing occurred in the Khushkhal Mena district of Kabul
but did not say when. It did not say whether the terrorists were
aligned with anti-communist rebels.
   Moslem guerrillas have been fighting the ruling communists in
Afghanistan since they seized power in a 1978 military coup. Soviet
forces entered the conflict to back the Kabul government in late
1979.
   Under this year's Geneva agreement, all of the estimated 100,000
Red Army troops are to leave the country by Feb. 15.

<HEAD>U.S. Forsees No Changes in International Economic Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The annual gathering of finance ministers and
other economic officials at the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund beginning this week in Berlin is unlikely to produce
a major change in world economic policies, according to a senior
Treasury Department official.
   ``The world economy ... is in the best shape that we've seen for
a very considerable period of time,'' said the official on Tuesday,
adding that American policy will continue steady during President
Reagan's final months in office.
   ``Our principal objectives will be to assure our partners of the
continued U.S. commitment to and support for the economic policy
coordination process and the debt strategy,'' said the official. He
said U.S. officials also would try ``to build on the considerable
progress being achieved in promoting a sound world economy and a
stable financial system.''
   The Berlin meeting will be the first opportunity for new
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to get acquainted with his
foreign counterparts, the official noted. Brady was confirmed as
secretary earlier this month to replace James Baker, who resigned
to head George Bush's presidential campaign.
   ``Inflation remains moderate and while continued vigilance is
needed on that front, there is no evidence of generalized price
pressures emerging,'' the official said.
   He said ``external imbalances,'' like the U.S. trade deficit and
the Japanese trade surplus, ``are coming down, more quickly in fact
than many people projected, as the latest U.S. trade figures have
recently confirmed.''
   He said economic growth in the major industrial countries this
year will be approximately 4 percent, with continued expansion next
year.
   During the Berlin meeting, the wealthiest countries, known as
the Group of Seven or G-7, plan to review their coordinated
approach to the world economy to see if it can be strengthened, the
official said.
   ``We expect the participants of that meeting to reaffirm the
policy directions that have been adopted, including the
understanding on exchange market cooperation,'' the official said.
   In recent years the G-7 countries have worked together to lower
the value of the U.S. dollar and raise the West German deutsche
Mark and Japanese yen on exchange markets.
   This has lowered the price of U.S. exports and made them more
competitive in the world market, helping to narrow the difference
between what the amount of goods and services the United States
exports and imports.
   The official said the U.S. government continues to stand by its
approach to easing the Third World debt burden as fundamentally
sound and believes ``that significant progress has been and is
being achieved.''
   The approach, outlined in 1985 by Baker, called on commercial
banks and international lending agencies to increase loans by $29
billion to the poorest 15 countries of the world in exchange for
moves by those countries toward free-market economies.
   Lending by the commercial banks, however, has fallen $20 billion
short of what the Baker plan envisioned. This has prompted other
countries, most notably France and Japan, to suggest alternatives.
   The official said ``debt-for-equity'' swaps used by some Latin
American countries to reduce their indebtedness showed promise.
Under the procedure, governments grant commercial banks shares in
government-owned businesses in exchange for forgiveness of the
government debt to the banks.
   ``Debt-equity swaps have totaled $9 billion dollars by our
estimate in the last 18 months or two years,'' said the official.
``There's room for substantially more activity of this kind if
various debtor countries would further open their markets and
remove foreign-investment restrictions.''

<HEAD>House Bill Would Allow Federal Agencies' Exit From Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday passed a bill that will
allow federal agencies to locate in suburbs outside Washington,
D.C., a move city officials said would mean a substantial loss in
local taxes.
   The bill, which amends a 1959 law requiring that federal
agencies be housed in the District of Columbia, was prompted by
concern that federally-leased land within the city had become too
expensive. The bill, passed by a voice vote, now goes to the Senate.
   ``This legislation is important in that it would provide needed
flexibility in the location of certain executive agencies in the
national capital region at a significant savings to the
government,'' said Rep. Glenn M. Anderson, D-Calif., chairman of
the Public Works and Transportation Committee.
   Average lease rates in the nation's capital range from $27 to
$37 a square foot, compared to only $18 to $22 per square foot in
Prince George's County, Md., and $22 to $31 per square foot in
Alexandria, Va., Anderson noted.
   A recent study by the General Services Administration, the
agency which handles all federal land purchases and rental
agreements, found that $6 million could be saved on a 10-year lease
of 100,000 square feet if a federal agency moved to a suburban
location.
   Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y., the bill's chief sponsor, said more
than 50 independent agencies would be allowed to relocate outside
Washington.
   However, the legislation would not allow the principal offices
of the 13 Cabinet-level agencies to move outside the District.
   ``The fact of the matter is that we have the opportunity in many
cases to lease equivalent space nearby in the suburbs at half of
what it would cost to stay in the District,'' said Molinari.
``We're not anticipating any large mass-scale exodus, but this
could save millions and millions of taxpayer dollars.''
   But while the bill could ultimately mean a savings for federal
taxpayers, city officials said they will be scrambling to make up
for the lost revenue.
   ``This takes a lot of federal lease space in the District and
sends it out to the suburbs,'' said Julius Hobson, the city's
intergovernmental liason officer. ``What we will lose is sales tax
revenue from federal employees eating and shopping in the city.''
   Hobson did not know exactly how much tax revenue the city would
lose.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Calls For Peace Conference In France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian rebel leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk said
Tuesday he would ask the French government to help him organize an
international conference on Cambodia ``as soon as possible.''
   Sihanouk, who arrived in Paris from Beijing, said he would
discuss the possibility of holding such a conference in France when
he meets President Francois Mitterrand on Friday.
   The prince, considered the key figure in a settlement to the
Cambodian civil war, told reporters he and Cambodian Premier Hun
Sen planned to hold talks in Paris starting Nov. 5.
   He said he has invited the two other leaders of the Cambodian
resistance _ Khieu Samphan, head of the Communist Khmer Rouge, and
Son Sann, leader of a second resistance faction _ to participate in
the November meetings.
   Sihanouk's followers and the two groups form a resistance
coalition whose aim is to remove Vietnamese troops from Cambodia
and dismantle Hun Sen's government.
   ``There is a turning point now,'' Sihanouk said, adding that an
international conference on Cambodia should be held ``as soon as
possible.'' He did not elaborate.
   The four parties involved in the Cambodian civil war _ the three
resistance groups and Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government _
met for the first time in July in Jakarta, Indonesia. Sihanouk did
not participate.
   Sihanouk and Cambodian Premier Hun Sen planned the Jakarta talks
at two meetings in Paris in December and January.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to end the three-year
reign of terror by Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge chief. Vietnam has
promised to withdraw its troops by the end of 1990.
   Sihanouk said Tuesday he would insist that any Cambodian peace
accord include a provision for the respect fo human rights.
   Sihanouk in the past has accused his Khmer Rouge coalition
partners of killing members of his Sihanoukist National Army, and
on Tuesday claimed they recently sank 15 boats filled with food for
his men.

<TEXT>
   The port of Balboa was under military control
Tuesday as 750 port workers kept up a strike begun last week to
demand payment of annual bonuses. They were joined this week by
government employees with the same demand.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Defense Forces personnel are protecting Balboa, the Pacific Coast
port of the Panama Canal. They said Vacamonte port police have
taken control of that small fishing port, 30 miles from Balboa.
   Vacamonte workers are not on strike.
   Balboa workers went on indefinite strike Sept. 12, demanding the
annual bonus that was due in August.
   On Monday, the 75,000-member National Federation of Public
Employees said they would join the strike for 48 hours.
   Federation undersecretary Jose Sanchez said workers at 80
percent of the government institutions were taking part. About half
of those who collect taxes and utility payments continue to work to
make sure the government will have the revenues needed to pay them.
   Employees at several government institutions told The Associated
Press some people were working and some were not. The government
maintains public employees do not have a right to strike.
   Sanchez said many striking public employees reported to work but
did not perform their duties.
   In Panama City, private businesses operated normally.
   Schools, closed by the government Monday, were in session
Tuesday.
   The 15,000-member Defense Forces, the country's armed forces,
said in a statement it ``will guarantee that public service
continues normally.
   ``Units of the police force offered to provide necessary
vigilance to ensure that every state dependency, public service and
the public in general have the necessary protection to carry out
their functions,'' the statement said.
   Sanchez said he was trying to gain the release of five Balboa
labor leaders arrested over the weekend.
   Besides demanding bonus payments, federation members also asked
that the government be restructured, accusing it of administrative
corruption.
   The pro-government newspaper El Diario Matutino said Tuesday
that sectors of the federation rushed into ``an adventure'' by
starting a strike that ``did not reach the level they expected.''
   ``Many of the official institutions operated on time and with
full personnel. Others worked partially,'' it said.
   Another Panama City daily, La Estrella de Panama, said the
strikes ``are counterproductive at a time when the country faces
the worst economic crisis in its history and is confronted by the
implacable aggression of the most powerful nation in the world.''
   The United States has been trying to force Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to quit as Defense Forces chief, a post that makes him
Panama's de facto leader. Noriega is under U.S. indictment on drug
trafficking charges. Among the pressures Washington applied were
economic sanctions.

<TEXT>
   Men gathered at a cockfight acted ``like
dogs'' during the gang rape of a woman near this southern Texas
town, a witness facing charges testified Tuesday.
   It was the first day of testimony in the trial of Orlando Garza,
23, who is among 10 men charged in the kidnapping and sexual
assault of a 19-year-old woman. All 10 men have entered innocent
pleas.
   Garza is the first defendant to go on trial in the case. In
addition to the 10 adults, a 14-year-old also has been charged.
   Jose Carlos Briones, one of the men facing charges in the case,
testified Tuesday that when he first saw Garza with the woman in a
car near a shed where the cockfight was being held, she and Garza
``were necking.''
   Briones said the woman later began offering resistance and that
many of the 20 or more men present sexually assaulted the woman on
the hood of Garza's car while other men held her arms and legs.
   ``They were just like dogs,'' said Briones, who was offered
probation in exchange for his testimony.
   Garza is charged with sexually assaulting the woman, and also
faces a kidnapping trial in connection with the case.
   Under state law, sexual assault is punishable by 2 to 20 years
in prison and or fine of up $10,000.
   Briones, who also was charged with sexually assaulting the
woman, said he fondled her, but denied raping her.
   He said the woman was groaning and crying while the men had sex
with her. Briones said he remembered seeing the woman being forced
to perform oral sex on Garza.
   Asked how many men assaulted the woman, he testified, ``I don't
remember because there were a whole bunch of them.''
   Under questioning by defense attorney Albert Pena, Briones said
the woman was not resisting Garza while she and Garza were in the
back seat of the car. Pena, in attacking the credibility of the
witness, also produced a court-ordered competency report produced
in June. In the report, Corpus Christi psychiatrist Laurence Taylor
wrote that Briones told him, ``She was lying there letting
everybody do it. She loved it _ no screaming from her. She was a
run-around.''
   Briones also told the psychiatrist that on March 26, the day he
said the rape took place, he had consumed a case of beer, according
to the report.
   Briones said Tuesday he did not remember telling Taylor the
woman participated voluntarily, and also said he did not remember
being promised probation in exchange for testimony.
   Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez said that he would
recommend probation for Briones in exchange for the testimony.
   Before testimony began Tuesday, the prosecutor apologized to the
jury in advance for sexually explicit language they would hear in
the trial.
   ``You will be hearing some language that is not dinner-table
conversation that may offend you,'' he told the jury of six men and
six women in the Duval County District Court.
   Gutierrez said the prosecution may take until Friday to present
its case. Witnesses he has said will testify include the victim and
a 12-year-old boy.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis proposed a broad health insurance
program for American workers Tuesday and told Republican rival
George Bush ``it's about time you came out from behind that flag''
and addressed the issue. Bush draped himself in patriotism,
visiting the nation's largest flag manufacturer.
   Dukakis, seeking support from working people, said the federal
government should enact legislation requiring most employers to
provide basic health insurance benefits for employees and
dependents.
   ``I think it's time we did something,'' said Dukakis. He said he
wanted to extend health insurance to all Americans, and that the
first step would be to provide it to working people through their
employers.
   Campaign aides said the first phase of Dukakis' program would
give benefits to about 22 million people who have none, leaving 15
million or more Americans still awaiting protection under a
national health insurance plan.
   Bush's campaign derided Dukakis' plan as ``socialized medicine''
and ``a prescription for financial disaster.''
   Criticizing Bush for what he said was a record of neglect and
indifference on health care issues, Dukakis said: ``Today he's
visiting a flag factory. Mr. Bush, don't you think it's about time
you came out from behind that flag and told us what you intend to
do to provide basic health care for 37 million of our fellow
citizens.''
   With their first face-to-face debate just five days away,
Dukakis campaigned in Houston and Bowling Green, Ky., while Bush
made a brief campaign hop to Bloomfield, N.J., to visit the Annin
Flag Co.
   ``My friends, flag sales are doing well and America is doing
well,'' said Bush, who has stressed patriotism in his campaign and
has attacked Dukakis for vetoing a Massachusetts bill that would
have required public school teachers to lead students in reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance.
   ``Americans have a new economic power, and I'm not going to let
them take that away from you,'' Bush said at a rally outside the
plant. He spoke in front of a huge American flag in a state
regarded as a key battleground of the presidential race.
   The vice president returned to Washington in time to swear in
fellow Texan Lauro Cavazos as education secretary, the first
Hispanic member of the Cabinet.
   Hispanics are a key voter bloc, particularly in states such as
California and Texas, and both Bush and Dukakis have pledged to put
a Hispanic-American at the Cabinet table.
   Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, campaigned in Boise,
Idaho, telling a crowd of more than 1,000 at the state Capitol that
Dukakis' policies ``are the policies of the past. Our policies are
the policies of the future.''
   Quayle, addressing the Dukakis insurance proposal, said he
favors pilot projects and tax incentives to encourage businesses to
provide insurance for workers.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee,
campaigned in the financially pinched Texas-Oklahoma oil patch,
promising that a Democratic administration's energy policy would
get American oil wells operating again with tax incentives and
other subsidies. He promised Dukakis would ``light a fire'' under
federal regulators blocking the sale of natural gas to the
Northeast.
   Dukakis began the day in Houston, where he visited Hermann
Hospital, part of the Texas Medical Center. In the waiting room of
a cancer ward, Dukakis met with a dozen patients and family
members, asking about medical costs and health insurance programs.
   Saying it was time to address the problem, Dukakis added, ``If
all goes well on the 8th of November, Sen. Bentsen and I are going
to do something about it. Spread the word.''
   Later, he flew to Bowling Green to outline his insurance
proposal at Western Kentucky University.
   Dukakis, the son of a physician, said he intends to make sure
that when Americans get sick, ``the first question they hear will
be the question my father used to ask _ the question that doctors
and nurses ask every day _ not `how can you pay' but `where does it
hurt?'''
   Dukakis' health adviser, Dr. David Blumenthal of Boston, said
the campaign had no estimate of how much Dukakis' plan would cost
employers. If elected, Dukakis will appoint a task force to report
by March 30, 1989, on legislation that would guarantee universal
health coverage, extending benefits to every American, working or
not, the campaign said.
   With Bush occupied on the campaign stump, his staff stepped in
to criticize Dukakis' health insurance proposal.
   ``This is socialized medicine and as such is a prescription for
financial disaster,'' said Bush press spokesman Mark Goodin. ``The
Dukakis plan would put the American economy in the hospital and
would list it in criticial condition.''
   Goodin said more than 82 percent of Americans under 65 are
insured under private or Medicaid-type health insurance. He said
that 75 percent of the workforce is covered by employer health
insurance.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll released Tuesday showed the
candidates practically tied. Although the numbers showed Bush
leading Dukakis 50 percent to 46 percent, the margin of error of
plus or minus three points washed out the lead.
   The survey of 1,271 likely voters was conducted Sept. 14-19.
   The survey found that 54 percent of the respondents don't know
enough about Dukakis, compared with 70 percent who found Bush to be
a known quantity.
   Bush was favored among respondents who considered holding down
taxes and preserving American family values to be prime issues,
while Dukakis was favored among those who thought creation of new
jobs to be a key issue.
   Although the debate is scheduled for Sunday, both sides were
diputing how high the rostrums should be for the two candidates,
said a source in the Bush campaign who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The source said the six-foot-one-inch Bush usually speaks at a
52-inch podium, but had already agreed to use a 46-inch one at the
request of the Dukakis campaign. But on Tuesday, Dukakis aide Paul
Brountas called and said aides to the five-foot-eight governor want
it at 42 inches or 44 inches, the Bush campaign source said.
   Brountas, the source said, countered with a proposal that if it
stays at 46 inches, Dukakis wants to use a riser. That is
unacceptable to the Bush people because it introduces
``artificiality'' the official said.

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday passed a bill by
Elizabeth Taylor's sixth husband on behalf of her second husband's
son, actor Michael Wilding, who was facing possible deportation
because of a drug conviction.
   The private relief bill by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., would exempt
Wilding, the 34-year-old son of Miss Taylor and the late British
actor, Michael Wilding, from a law prohibiting permanent resident
visas for people convicted of drug violations.
   Wilding, now living in New York City and employed as an actor on
the television soap opera ``The Guiding Light,'' was convicted in
Wales in 1974, three years after he had renounced his U.S.
citizenship, of possessing marijuana and cultivating marijuana
plants in a house that he and six others shared.
   He returned to the United States in 1981. But because of the
conviction, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has refused
to grant him a permanent resident visa.
   Warner said the INS has taken no definite steps to expel Wilding
but said the actor's attorneys anticipate the government will
commence deportation proceedings in the near future.
   ``So far as I know, and his mother knows, Mr. Wilding has lived
a drug-free, law-abiding existence since the occurrence of the
offenses during his very early life,'' Warner said in a letter to
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   The bill, which still has to be acted upon by the House, was
approved by the Senate on a unanimous consent vote without
objection.
   ``My knowledge and respect for this man developed during my
marriage to his mother, Elizabeth Taylor,'' Warner said.
   Warner and the actress were married at his northern Virginia
estate on Dec. 4, 1976, and they were granted a no-fault divorce
Nov. 5, 1982, following a 14-month separation.
   ``I was his stepfather during that five-year period,'' when the
couple was together, Warner said. ``I can attest from my personal
knowledge, and that of his mother, that Mr. Wilding would continue
to be a law-abiding resident of the United States.''
   Wilding was married for the second time in 1982. He has a
16-year-old daughter who lives with his first wife in Portland,
Ore., and he has a 13-year-old daughter, born out of wedlock, who
lives in Wales.
   Miss Taylor's other husbands were Richard Burton, whom she
married twice, Nicky Hilton, Eddie Fisher and Michael Todd.

<TEXT>
   Lobstermen who staged a 10-day strike
to protest wholesale prices were back at work Tuesday after
receiving assurances dealers would pay more in the future.
   The fishermen went back to work Monday in a ``good faith'' deal
with buyers for future price increases, said David Cousens, a
representative of the Maine Lobstermen's Association.
   ``We were successful, but we paid for it dearly,'' Cousens said.
``But we put our point across and that's what we wanted to do. We
didn't want to drive dealers out of business.''
   Cousens estimated up to 400 lobster boats participated at one
time or another during the strike, which began Sept. 9 and ended
Monday. About 1,000 people have lobster-fishing licenses in the
affected area, the middle coast of Maine.
   Lobstermen staged the strike in hopes of raising the price paid
by dealers for lobster from $2.10 per pound to the $2.25 per pound
lobstermen to the north and south receive, said Edward Blackmore,
president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association.
   ``There's no signed agreements or anything, but it was
understood by the group involved they were going to go back and get
prices at the $2.25 level, which is what they thought they (needed
to) operate and make a living at,'' Blackmore said.

   A futures trading firm with 17 offices in
Florida, California, New York and Michigan has agreed to shut down
its operations as part of its settlement of fraud charges leveled
by the Commodity Futures Trading Corp.
   Chilmark Commodities Corp., without admitting or denying the
allegations, agreed to the revocation of its registration as a
broker. It also consented to an injunction barring it from ``fraud
in connection with soliciting customers to trade commodity options
on futures contracts,'' the CFTC said in a release Tuesday.
   The commission also charged Chilmark with unauthorized trading
and with failing to provide customers with the price of the option
prior to purchase.
   The consent order of permanent injunction was approved Sept. 15
by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
Simultaneously, an administrative complaint by the commission was
settled.
   Chilmark, founded in 1985, was a medium-sized firm operating in
New York City, but began expanding rapidly in 1986, opening seven
offices in southern Florida. By 1987, it had 250 sales brokers and
took in more than $13 million in commissions.
   The CFTC accused Chilmark of ``high pressure sales tactics
typical of a boiler room operation'' and of ``routinely (making)
false or deceptive statements in soliciting customers.''
   The complaint ``described a sales operation where the paramount
goal was to maximize commission income by maximizing the number of
options purchased by customers and misrepresenting the profit
potential,'' the agency said.
   Most of Chilmark's customers spent 40 percent to 60 percent of
their investment on commissions, it said.
   Chilmark officials could not be reached for comment at their New
York headquarters early Tuesday evening.

<HEAD>2nd Blaze In 3 Days Near Subway Station Where 31 Died Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire in a tunnel Tuesday night delayed subway
services at King's Cross station, the London fire service reported.
It was the second fire in the same spot in three days, but no
injures were reported in either blaze.
   On Nov. 18 last year, 31 people died and 80 were injured when
fire broke out under an escalator at King's Cross, the London
subway system's busiest station.
   The fire service said in a statement that in Tuesday's incident,
trash that had accumulated in the tunnel beween King's Cross and
Euston, the next subway station down the line, caught fire but was
quickly extinguished.
   It said that on Saturday, services were briefly disrupted after
a small fire broke out at the same spot. That fire burned itself
out before emergency crews arrived to tackle it.
   The statement did not say what was thought to have caused the
fires on Tuesday and Saturday.
   Investigators believe the Nov. 18 fire was started when a
lighted cigarette was dropped on a wooden escalator surrounded by
grease-soaked trash. The fire raced up the escalator and a ball of
flame exploded in the ticket lobby.
   Smoking has been banned throughout the subway system following
the Nov. 18 fire. But an independent inquiry into that fire
expressed concern last June at the end of a 91-day hearing that
senior managers of London Regional Transport, the public
corporation that runs the subway, might not accept the lessons of
that disaster.
   The inquiry's chief counsel, Roger Henderson, accused senior
managers of seeking to shirk responsibility for the fire. The
managers defended existing safety procedures but during the inquiry
announced a package of 101 new safety measures.

   The flags of Armenia, the Ukraine, Wales,
Scotland and Puerto Rico will be returned to flagpoles lining a
downtown boulevard in an effort to end a dispute with several
ethnic groups, a city official said.
   A Latvian flag, removed for repairs, also will be restored to
the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, said city representative Gerri
Walker, who oversees Mayor W. Wilson Goode's protocol office.
   Several flags were removed over the summer when city officials
decided to adopt U.S. recognition of a government as the standard
by which nations' flags should fly.
   The Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are regarded
as republics in exile, even though they have been absorbed by the
Soviet Union. Lithuanian and Estonian flags are already in place.
   The tree-lined parkway modeled after the Champs Elysees in Paris
has been decorated with more than 70 flags every summer since the
bicentennial celebrations of 1976.
   ``But there have been constant questions about why some flags
were there and some weren't,'' Ms. Walker said.
   About 60 people of Armenian, Ukrainian and Latvian descent
rallied Sept. 2 outside City Hall to protest the removal of their
homelands' banners.
   Ms. Walker said the flags will fly until late autumn, when all
flags are taken down to protect them from winter storms.

   A strong earthquake rocked the Pacific coastal area
on Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido Wednesday, the Central
Meteorological Agency said.
   Local police said they had no reports of damage or injuries.
   The quake registered a preliminary reading of 5.1 on the Richter
scale and happened at 7:43 a.m. (6:43 p.m. EDt Tuesday), the agency
reported.
   It said the tremor was centered 30 miles under the ocean floor
off Hokkaido's eastern port city of Kushiro, 556 miles northwest of
Tokyo.
   The open-ended Richter scale measures the magnitude of an
earthquake, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale is considered very strong,
while one measuring 6 is severe and capable of causing widespread
damage near the epicenter.

<TEXT>
   Firefighters used a 20-foot-wide
blackened dirt barrier to keep a 4-day-old arson fire from
advancing on homes near a road outside city limits, despite erratic
winds Tuesday.
   Firefighters ordered the evacuation of 500 people along a
10-mile stretch of Pleasants Valley Road, just west of city limits,
fearing that afternoon winds could fan the blaze toward scattered
homes near the road. The residents were allowed to return to their
homes by Tuesday night.
   ``The backfire operation was pretty darn successful. The wind
has cooperated,'' said Kirk Landuyt, fire camp spokesman for the
California Department of Forestry.
   The Miller fire, named for the canyon in which it began, has
burned 22,000 acres since it started Saturday. Seven homes were
destroyed Sunday. It is one of two major California blazes that
have destroyed 31 homes and about 30,000 acres of wildland, brush
and timber since the weekend.
   Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday proclaimed states of emergency
for Shasta and Solano counties, the first step in making state and
federal aid available to victims of the wildfires.
   Elsewhere across the West, however, the situation was improved
as the worst summer for fires in three decades wound to a close. In
all, nearly 70,000 fires have been tallied, blackening more than
4.1 million acres, about half of them in Alaska.
   ``I think fire season is just about over here,'' spokeswoman
Madelyn Kempf said Tuesday as crews broke camp and began departing
from the 34,500-acre Red Bench fire in Montana's Glacier National
Park. It rained ``almost all last night,'' she said. Some 200
firefighters also left Oregon's Willamette National Forest on
Tuesday, although others remained behind to finish firefighting
efforts there.
   In Yellowstone National Park, ``things are very calm,'' said
spokeswoman Marsha Karle. Officials Monday released 1,000 soldiers
who had spent more than 30 days battling flames that blackened
nearly half the 2.2 million-acre park.
   Temperatures in the park reached only the 40s Tuesday, but
forecasts called for 60s and 70s later by Friday. Fire
behavioralist Bruce Freet said just two days of dry weather could
spell a return to the active burning seen two weeks ago.
   Outside Vacaville, Bill Morgan watched as firefighters burned
brush around his $675,000 Pleasants Valley Road home as part of
their attempt to stop the fire at the road.
   ``We just moved in. What a heck of a housewarming,'' said
Morgan, 42.
   ``I hope they catch the sucker that started this, put him in
jail for a hundred years and throw away the key,'' said Fred Shaw,
18, another Pleasants Valley Road resident.
   John Ferreira, a captain with the California Department of
Forestry, said firefighters were optimistic that the blaze wouldn't
jump the road, but said afternoon winds could push the fire to the
homes west of the road. The fire was 50 percent contained, or
surrounded, at midday Tuesday.
   ``If today goes well for us, we should have 100 percent
containment Thursday,'' Ferreira said.
   The fire Monday came to within one half-mile of the Vacaville
city limits, but did not threaten the populated area of the city of
51,000 45 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   The 7,800-acre Fern fire near Redding, 220 miles north of San
Francisco, was 75 percent contained Tuesday morning, but winds were
hampering firefighters there, too.
   ``I'm looking at the flag and it's standing straight out,'' said
forestry department spokesman Richard Just.
   Six people have been injured in the Fern fire, including a man
listed in critical condition after a tree fell on him when he was
clearing burned timber.
   The fire also destroyed 24 residences, Just said. Earlier
reports put the number of homes destroyed at seven, but officials
said Tuesday that a recount showed other homes, chiefly mobile
homes, had also burned Sunday or Monday.
   The Fern fire started when someone shot out an insulator from a
power line about 20 miles east of Redding. Ferreira said the Miller
fire has been determined to be arson because all other causes were
eliminated and truck tire tracks were found near where the fire
started Saturday. There are no suspects.

<TEXT>
   Sandinista government officials and
Contra rebels blamed each other Tuesday for the breakdown of talks
aimed at stabilizing a cease-fire in the 7-year-old civil war.
   The two sides held talks Monday in Guatemala City in an attempt
to reopen peace negotiations to end the war that has claimed more
than 28,000 Nicaraguan lives.
   ``The interest of Managua is to agree on a definitive
cease-fire, which the Contras have rejected,'' Victor Hugo Tinoco,
deputy foreign minister and Sandinista negotiator, told the
pro-goverment newspaper El Nuevo Diario on Tuesday.
   Last week the Contras accepted the leftist government's proposal
to hold the talks in Guatemala. But the U.S.-backed rebels said
they would enter formal negotiations only after the release of 40
opposition leaders jailed in July during anti-government protests.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras on March 23 signed a pact, which
provided for a temporary truce and high-level talks in Managua. But
the Contras say they will participate in talks anywhere but the
Nicaraguan capital, where they say their movement is restricted.
The Sandinistas insist that Managua be the site of negotiations.
   ``This is a clear demonstration of the lack of Sandinista desire
to establish or take measures and set up reforms that permit a
democratic opening,'' said Roberto Ferrey, one of seven Contra
leaders. He spoke Tuesday on the rebels' clandestine Radio
Liberation.
   A series of meetings to set a timetable for the rebels to lay
down their arms permanently and for the Sandinistas to institute
democratic reforms ended in stalemate June 9.
   President Daniel Ortega, speaking on state-run radio Monday
night, said the goal of the rebels was to make it appear the
government was unwilling to bend so that the U.S. Congress would
resume military funding for the Contras.
   The Congress cut off military aid to the rebels Feb. 29. The
Contras, citing Soviet supplies to the Sandinistas, claim they need
such aid to act as a bargaining chip in negotiations.
   ``The Yankees are interested, through the Contras, to try to
show that Nicaragua has an intransigent position ... to approve
military aid for the counterrevolutionaries,'' Ortega said.
   ``We should speak with those who pay the gunslingers and not
talk with the gunslingers,'' the Sandinista leader said, referring
to the repeated Nicaraguan call for bilateral talks with the Reagan
Administration.
   Ortega said Reagan's ``obsession'' with Nicaragua has opened the
possibility of a direct military invasion of his country by
American troops. He said the number of American surveillance
flights over Nicaragua have increased after the March truce.
   The president also charged the U.S. government has continued to
supply the Contras and the ``unarmed Contras,'' an expression used
to describe internal opposition groups.
   Ortega cited the U.S.-government linked National Endowment for
Democracy, which he said provided more than $600,000 for opposition
political parties and groups, including $47,000 for the La Prensa
opposition newspaper.
   As many as 10,000 Contras fled from Nicaragua in the past five
months to base camps in eastern Honduras. Congressional aid
approved in March provides only for non-lethal goods to be
distributed in Honduras.
   Contra sources say no more than 2,000 rebels remain inside
Nicaragua.
   In a related development, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel
D'Escoto Brockmann said Tuesday that his government hopes to open
direct talks with the United States after a new U.S. president is
elected in November.
   ``Until now this has been impossible, but we hope that with a
new administration we can do this,'' D'Escoto told reporters in
Caracas, Venezuela.
   ``The future is black if the U.S. does not decide seriously to
redefine its vital interests in Latin America to exclude the need
to interfere in internal affairs,'' said D'Escoto, who is among
delegates from 26 Latin American and Caribbean nations meeting in
Venezuela to discuss regional economic issues.

   The United States will soon resume
negotiations on an agreement that could scale down U.S. use of
military bases in Spain and cut off U.S. military aid to the
strategic Mediterranean country, a senior State Department official
said Tuesday.
   Preparations for relocating the supersonic F16 jets and crews of
the U.S. 441st Air Tactical Wing from Torrejon air base outside
Madrid to Italy ``are going very smoothly'' said Assistant
Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway.
   Spain insisted on removal of the 441st unit from the
high-profile Torrejon base early in the current talks which,
however will provide for U.S. air and naval forces to continue
using other Spanish installations.
   Testifying before the House subcommittee on European and Middle
Eastern affairs, Ms. Ridgway gave few details of the base
negotiations, suspended in mid-summer and expected to resume soon.
But Ambassador Reginald Bartholemew, the chief U.S. negotiator has
just returned to Madrid, she said.
   ``Both governments wish to get this agreement behind us,'' she
said. ``We remain hopeful that a basis for settling the few
remaining issues can be reached soon.''
   Ms. Ridgway said Spain will not contribute to the estimated $500
million construction costs NATO will pay for the U.S. unit's new
facilities in Italy, and under the new base agreement will not
receive U.S. military aid.
   U.S. budget austerity last year reduced American aid to Spain to
slightly over $100 million, down from $403 million in military
credits and grants annually pledged in an expiring five-year
agremeent between the two countries.
   Asked if the new arrangement would be consistent with Spain's
role in NATO, Ms. Ridgway replied: ``Spain has defined its role in
the alliance as it deems appropriate for Spain. ... I think that,
while we might wish for more, the Spanish are very clear about what
is possible, and that is what we are working on,'' she added.
   Meanwhile, another alliance member, Portugal recently restated
to a Pentagon-State Department team its concern about declining
levels of U.S. military aid but declared it intends to continue
providing U.S. access to Lajes air base in the Azores Islands, Ms.
Ridgway said.
   The U.S. delegation in Lisbon ``had some good talks'' during
consultations on broadening bilateral cooperation, she said.
Another round of talks is expected in October, she added.
   The Portuguese government voiced concern last March that current
U.S. aid of $117 million is little more than half the 1985 level.

<TEXT>
   C. Rufus Rorem, who helped introduce
prepaid health insurance as a co-founder of Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, has died at 93.
   Rorem died Monday at a nursing home here.
   He was described in a recent issue of Modern Healthcare magazine
as a man ``who made Blue Cross a household name.''
   In the late 1920s, he was working in Chicago for the Julius
Rosenwald Fund, a medical philanthropy, when he was named
accountant and economist for the Washington, D.C.-based Committee
on the Cost of Medical Care.
   The committee's report, ``The Cost of Medical Care,'' issued in
1930, advocated group medical practice and group medical
prepayment, concepts considered radical at the time.
   In 1937, Rorem joined the American Hospital Association where he
continued to develop hospital prepayment programs.
   As director of the association's committee on hospital service _
later the Blue Cross Commission _ Rorem helped shape the rapidly
proliferating hospital insurance plans that eventually came under
the aegis of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
   ``Rufus Rorem's early and lasting dedication to the principals
of rational health care payment and planning has been an
inspiration to Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and the
association,'' said association President Bernard R. Tresnowski.
   Rorem later became executive director of the Hospital Council of
Philadelphia. After his retirement in 1959, he remained active in
health care-planning organizations and served as a special
consultant to the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Asssociation.
   In the 1920s, he also was associate dean of the University of
Chicago School of Business.
   Rorem is the father of classical composer and music writer Ned
Rorem.

   A first-grader on his way home from school
who allegedly pulled a gun on two female classmates and demanded
sex could be suspended for two years, a school official said.
   The 7-year-old boy, who told investigators he brought the gun
from home, was suspended immediately and awaits a hearing, said
Bill Duncan, who is in charge of discipline for the Polk County
school district.
   ``He did have a weapon there at the school and he did threaten
some girls with it,'' Duncan said. ``We know for a fact that he had
it because he admitted that he had it. Also, the mother admitted it
was her weapon, from the reports that I had.''
   ``At this point we have not charged him. We have not determined
that any violations have occurred,'' Polk County sheriff's
spokeswoman Lynne Breidenbach said Tuesday night. ``There's a big
if about whether charges will be filed.''
   The sheriff's report will be forwarded to the state attorney's
office for review, routine procedure in criminal investigations,
she said.
   School investigators don't know whether the gun was loaded. It
belonged to the live-in boyfriend of the boy's mother, Ms.
Breidenbach said.
   Authorities refused to reveal what kind of gun was used.
   The boy, whose name was being withheld, attended Crystal Lake
Elementary School. The incident occurred off school property, Ms.
Breidenbach said.
   Some classmates apparently saw the gun, but the boy threatened
them and told them to keep quiet, officials said. They told a
custodian after school.

   The case of three men charged in the
kidnap-murder of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent slain
in Mexico went to a federal court jury Tuesday.
   The jury got the case against the trio 3{ years after the death
of DEA agent Enrique Camarena, whose battered body was discovered
at a ranch in the Mexican countryside.
   The defendants are alleged to have acted at the behest of
Mexican drug baron Rafael Caro Quintero. Prosecutors contend Caro
ordered Camarena's slaying to wreak vengeance for DEA assaults on
his drug empire.
   Two defendants are charged with kidnap, murder and conspiracy,
and one with being an accessory after the fact in the murders of
Camarena and his pilot.
   Defense attorneys argued the three are scapegoats of a
government intent on closing the books on the politically volatile
case, which disrupted relations between the U.S. and Mexico.
   Jurors who heard eight weeks of testimony were instructed by
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, then received the case. They
selected a foreman then retired until Wednesday to begin
deliberating.
   Earlier in the day, a prosecutor delivered his final statement,
denouncing defense lawyers for ``outrageous and obscene''
arguments. He called for conviction of all defendants.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Roel Campos, in a rebuttal that drew a
barrage of objections from the defense and an unsuccessful motion
for mistrial, said the lawyers had stooped to unwarranted personal
attacks on the prosecution team.
   He denounced ``this tactic of personal slander.''
   ``They have accused us of somehow presenting perjured testimony,
of somehow coaching witnesses,'' said Campos. ``Ladies and
gentlmen, did the prosecution in this case do anything improper?
I'm here to tell you we did not.''
   ``Special agent Camarena died in the service of his country,''
Campos told jurors. ``He died in the same way a Marine on a foreign
shore would die for his country.''
   Camarena was abducted in the Mexican city of Guadalajara on Feb.
7, 1985. His body and that of his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar,
were found buried at a remote ranch in Mexico several weeks later.
They were severely beaten and Camarena's skull was crushed.
   Campos drew the loudest objections from defense attorneys when
he reviewed the evidence against Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, and
Raul Lopez Alvarez, 28, both charged with Camarena's murder. Lopez
is a former Mexican state police officer. Verdugo is an admitted
drug trafficker. Their lawyers said Campos was misstating evidence
against them.
   A third defendant, Jesus Felix Gutierrez, 38, is charged with
helping Caro escape from Mexico after Camarena's brutal murder.
   Lopez's attorney, Yolanda Barrera, moved for a mistrial after
Campos told jurors that the defendants do not face the death
penalty. He said he was responding to a defense statement that the
defendants ``are fighting for their lives.''
   They face a possible maximum of life imprisonment.
   Rafeedie, who denied the mistrial motion, nevertheless
instructed jurors to disregard the subject of penalties, which he
said was ``entirely taboo.''
   ``Your job,'' the judge said, ``is to reach a verdict regardless
of what the consequences might be.''
   The case stirred bitter feelings between Mexican and American
officials after Mexican police officials were linked to the killing
and to Caro's escape to Costa Rica.
   Nine men were indicted in Los Angeles in connection with the
Camarena slaying, but only three are standing trial here. Caro, 33,
and three other defendants are in custody and awaiting trial on
related charges in Mexico. An eighth man has died and another is a
fugitive.

   President Victor Paz Estenssoro
reorganized his Cabinet Tuesday evening to allow ministers who will
run in the May 1989 presidential and congressional elections to
campaign for office.
   All 17 ministers resigned earlier Tuesday. Paz Estenssoro
subsequently renamed 13 to their former posts.
   Foreign Minister Guillermo Bedregal said in a letter presented
to Paz Estenssoro that ``the beginning of intense political
activity motivated 17 ministers to resign.''
   The most important change in the new Cabinet is the planning
minister. Paz Estenssoro replaced Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, an
architect of the government's economic stabilization program, with
Fernando Romero, a prominent businessman who was running the Social
Emergency Fund.
   The fund is financed by Western governments and the United
Nations. It has created jobs for tens of thousands of workers.
   Sanchez de Lozada was nominated for the presidency this month by
the governing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement Party. He
indicated he could not campaign while holding a minister's
portfolio.
   Paz Estenssoro also replaced the ministers of health, industry
and commerce. The Cabinet is named by the president and does not
have to be ratified by Congress.
   Paz Estenssoro said Tuesday evening that he would continue his
economic program.
   The government program has lowered inflation from 24,000 percent
four years ago to 20 percent estimated for 1988 in this nation of
6.4 million people.
   The program included liberalizing the economy, ending all price
supports, a 95-percent currency devaluation and a tenfold rise in
gasoline prices.
   The U.S.-educated Sanchez de Lozada will campaign against former
military strongman General Hugo Banzer Suarez, whose party won the
largest share of voters in last year's municipal elections, and
Jaime Paz Zamora, head of the Revolutionary Leftist Movement party.

   Visiting Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned Tuesday that the ecological threat
now facing mankind could be as dangerous as the nuclear arms race.
   He said upon arriving for a 24-hour stay in Denmark that he
expected ecology to be among issues he will discuss with officals
here. He said European issues, arms reductions and Danish-Soviet
topics were also on the agenda.
   ``The ecological threat is mounting with the same speed and
scope as the nuclear threat,'' Shevardnadze told reporters at
Copenhagen's Kastrup International Airport.
   ``There are really many problems in the modern world. There are
hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical weapons, and conventional
arms systems ... and not the least the ecological situation, which
is also a great danger.''
   His official visit to Denmark is the first by a Soviet foreign
minister since Andrei Gromyko, now president, came here in 1976.
   In a prepared statement, Shevardnadze said: ``We live in an
interdependent world, and that implies that we are all equally
concerned about it, try to find ways to enhance general security,
abolish nuclear and chemical weapons, reduce miltary confrontation
and act together to save the world from ecological catastrophe.''
   The 32-member Soviet delegation will proceed on to United States
Wednesday, where Shevardnadze is to have talks with Secretary of
State George P. Shultz in Washington and attend the opening of the
United Nations General Assembly in New York.

   Publishers of sex-oriented
newspapers would be forced to post 24-hour guards at newsracks to
prevent minors from buying the papers under a law given preliminary
approval.
   But City Attorney James Penman said Tuesday he would recommend
that city leaders rescind the ordinance because it conflicts with
state law, which takes precedence. The City Council gave the
ordinance initial approval by a 4-2 vote Monday.
   Penman said he had done further study since making a statement
earlier Tuesday that he believed the law would stand up to
constitutional scrutiny.
   ``I don't see the ordinance as opening a Pandora's box or
undermining the First Amendment,'' he had said.
   ``We're just responding to the community's concerns about
keeping adult material away from children, that's all.''
   The ordinance, believed by Penman to be the first of its kind,
allows coin-operated machines with adult publications only if
publishers hire guards to make sure minors aren't among the
customers.
   A final Council vote is scheduled Oct. 3. If approved, the
ordinance would become law in 30 days, barring appeals.
   The Constitution protects publishers from laws that ban their
written material, but courts have sided with cities that restricted
the availability of pornography to people under age 18, Penman said.
   Sex-oriented newspapers published locally are sold in newsracks
throughout the city alongside those for conventional daily
newspapers.
   No representatives of adult publications attended the Council
meeting, but the measure has drawn criticism from publishers who
would be affected by it.
   ``There's absolutely no way we can man all the newsracks,'' said
Bill Berk, editor for the Los Angeles-based Hollywood Press.
   Penman wouldn't comment on the financial feasibility.
   ``But the concern we were asked to address was how to protect
minors, how to prevent them from buying adult material, and that's
what this ordinance does,'' he said.
   Police Chief Donald Burnett spoke in favor of the measure, which
would allow officers to seize coin-operated newsracks that are not
monitored by adults 24 hours a day.
   Councilmen Michael Maudsley and Jess Flores voted against the
proposal, saying they believe the money required to defend it in
court could be better spent.
   ``My concern is I think it is a First Amendment issue,''
Maudsley said. ``We're going to spend an awful lot of money going
to the Supreme Court.''
   Sherri Tuckett, who heads a group supporting the measure, was
among those who presented a petition signed by about 700 residents.
   ``This ordinance has nothing to do with the First Amendment,''
she said. ``If adults want to purchase these publications that's
fine. But we have a responsibility to keep our children from being
exposed to this type of material.
   ``I'm not objecting to the newsracks being on the sidewalks, but
I am against them being so readily available to curious minors.
This stuff can be harmful to them.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Marcos Received $47.7 Million From Japanese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted President Ferdinand Marcos
received at least $47.7 million in kickbacks from Japanese firms
between 1966 and 1981, the Manila Chronicle newspaper reported
Tuesday.
   It said the figure was contained in a 1987 report by the
Presidential Commission on Good Government, established to retrieve
the estimated $10 billion the government says Marcos embezzled
before his February 1986 ouster.
   According to the newspaper, Marcos received commissions on
projects which Japanese firms undertook as part of an agreement to
help rebuild the Philippines as reparation for damage during
Japanese occupation in World War II.
   These included irrigation, flood control, and construction of
highways and bridges.
   ``It may be inferred that contracts were not necessarily awarded
to the lowest bidder but to the Japanese trader or supplier who was
willing to give a commission to Filipino officials, particularly
then Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos,'' the newspaper quoted
the report as saying.
   The newspaper said at least $17 million of the total $47.7
million was deposited in secret Swiss bank accounts.
   Allegations that Marcos received kickbacks from Japanese firms
are not new and have been aired frequently here since the former
president fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after his ouster in a
civilian-military uprising.
   The allegation was based on affidavits filed by former Public
Works Minister Baltazar Aquino, no relation to President Corazon
Aquino.
   Baltazar Aquino is to give a deposition in November about
irregularities in the Marcos administration. Marcos has petitioned
the anti-graft court to allow him to return to cross-examine the
former minister.
   The government has asked the court to reject Marcos' request. A
decision is pending, and the government is expected to appeal to
the Supreme Court if the petition is granted.

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old boy who blew up an Iraqi
tank by stringing grenades around his body and flinging himself
under it will be shown on a new Iranian 1,000 riyal banknote, the
official Islamic Republic news agency said Tuesday.
   IRNA said Hussein Fahmideh died during the Iraqi siege of Abadan
in Khuzistan province in the early years of the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, said that Iranian patriarch
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini once referred to Fahmideh and part of
the quote will appear on the note: ``Our leader is that 12-year-old
child who ...''
   Khomeini's picture will be on the other side of the note, said
IRNA.
   The note, worth a little over $14 at the official exchange rate,
will start circulating Sept. 22, it said.
   Iran says Iraq started the gulf war on that day in 1980.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the war went into effect Aug. 20,
and peace talks are set to resume in early October in New York.
   No estimates are available on how many children were part of
Iran's armed forces. But the United Nations and humanitarian groups
said the children were often used on the frontlines to clear
minefields, following Khomeini's instructions that ``martyrs'' who
died in the war would be rewarded with paradise.
   Iran has previously denied that children were an established
part of its war effort.

   A federal appeals court ruling barring a
Christian-operated manufacturing plant from requiring employees to
attend prayer services will spark new rounds of court action, a
lawyer said Tuesday.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled
Monday that Townley Engineering and Manufacturing Co. of Eloy,
Ariz., must allow employees to skip the services if they want to.
   Townley is expected to appeal the decision, said Mary Jo O'Neil,
an anti-discrimination lawyer with the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. The EEOC will seek to have the ruling
applied to Townley's other plants nationwide, she added.
   In addition, the EEOC is already seeking contempt sanctions
against Townley over continued services at the plant and is
appealing a lower court decision upholding the termination of an
employee who objected to the services.
   Monday's 2-1 ruling requires the Florida-based company to offer
non-participation to employees whose religious convictions conflict
with the service. The ruling does not, however, ban the services
outright as the EEOC had sought.
   The plant, about 55 miles southeast of Phoenix, makes mining
equipment.
   Owners Jake and Helen Townley say the business, like the rest of
their lives, reflects their born-again Christian faith; they
enclose biblical tracts in all mail, put biblical verses on
business documents, and require employees to attend
``non-denominational'' services during work hours once a week.
   Louis Pelvas, a machinist hired in 1979, attended the services
for two months but then objected because he was an atheist.
   Pelvas left the company four months later, and lost a damage
lawsuit in which he contended he effectively had been fired. But
the EEOC lodged a complaint against the company charging religious
discrimination.
   U.S. District Judge Earl Carroll ruled in favor of the agency in
May 1987, barring mandatory services at the plant. The appeals
court allowed services to resume while it considered the case, but
ruled Monday that objectors must be allowed the option of staying
away.
   ``Where the practices of employer and employee conflict ... it
is not inappropriate to require the employer, who structures the
workplace to a substantial degree, to travel the extra mile in
adjusting its free exercise (of religion) rights, if any, to
accommodate the employee's ... rights,'' said the opinion by Judge
Joseph Sneed.
   The lone dissenter, Judge John Noonan, said Townley had done
enough by allowing the employee to wear ear plugs and read a
newspaper while attending the services.
   Jake Townley was not available for comment Tuesday, and Helen
Townley, who answered the telephone at the couple's home, said,
``I'm not interested in talking about that today.''
   Jake Townley has said in depositions that he intends to follow
``God's law'' and continue with the services even if his actions
conflict with U.S. law, and O'Neil said she did not expect him to
back down.
   The Townley's lawyer said he would consult them about a possible
appeal.

<HEAD>Comedy Actor Dies In Filming Accident In Spain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Popular British stage, film and television comedy
actor Roy Kinnear died Tuesday night 24 hours after falling from a
horse while filming near Madrid, Spain, Press Association reported.
   The British domestic news agency quoted an unidentified
spokesman at the Ruber International Hospital in the Spanish
capital as saying:
   ``We can confirm that Mr Kinnear ... is dead. He fell from a
horse during filming, suffered head injuries and died ... in our
intensive care unit.''
   Press Association said it understood work on the film, ``The
Last Return Of The Three Musketeers'' co-starring Michael York and
Oliver Reed, was suspended because of the death of the roly-poly,
54-year-old actor.
   It said York took Kinnear to the hospital after the fall and
that Kinnear's wife, actress Carmel Cryan, was at her husband's
hospital bedside.
   Kinnear was a veteran of Joan Littlewood's pioneering Theatre
Workshop in London in the 1950s and 1960s, of The Royal Shakespeare
Company and of The National Theatre.
   He became nationally known through his appearances in ``That Was
The Week That Was,'' the British Broadcasting Corp.'s innovative
former TV satire show that helped set the pace for the so-called
``Swinging '60s'' in Britain.
   One of his main screen partnerships was with director Richard
Lester who would insist on a role for his favorite comedian. Their
output included ``The Knack,'' ``Help,'' which starred the Beatles,
``A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum,'' and ``The Three
Musketeers.''
   In 1967, Kinnear was invited to join the Royal Shakespeare
Company where his roles included Touchstone in ``As You Like It.''
   Kinnear's recent stage work included The Common Man in the
recent London revival of Robert Bolt's play ``A Man For All
Seasons'' starring Charlton Heston; and parts in ``The Duchess of
Malfi,'' ``The Real Inspector Hound'' and ``The Critic.''
   His TV appearances included ``Inside George Webley,''
``Cowboys,'' ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and Tom
Stoppard's TV movie ``Squaring the Circle.''
   Broadcaster Ned Sherrin, who directed ``That Was The Week That
Was,'' said: ``He was a most dear and caring man. All of us liked
him. He suffered fools gladly. Above all, he was a great clown and
a very considerable actor with wonderful range.''
   Kinnear and his wife had three children.

<HEAD>With AM-Nicaragua-Contras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government refused to issue a
permit Tuesday that would allow an opposition coalition to hold a
protest march, saying the rally could lead to violence.
   The Democratic Coordinate's last rally, on July 10, ended in a
bloody clash between police and protesters.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge said the permit for Sunday's
planned march was denied because the protest was intended ``to
create disturbances.''
   The opposition coalition protested the decision.
   ``Political groups should have access to the means of
communcation, take part in the right of association and the ability
to hold public manifestations,'' Duilio Baltodano, a Democratic
Coordinate leader, was quoted as saying by the newspaper La Prensa
late Tuesday.
   The opposition coalition is made up of opposition political
parties and organizations. Forty opposition figures were arrested
during the previous rally and face criminal charges.
   Borge acknowledged during a news conference Tuesday that the
denial of the march permit left the government open to criticism.
   But he added: ``It would be worse and would be a larger
political cost and a greater pretext for our enemy and more of an
argument for aid to the Contras (the U.S.-supported rebels) if
there were provocations here that led to bloodshed in the streets
of Managua.''
   In Washington Tuesday, House Speaker Jim Wright said the CIA
admitted in congressional testimony that it used undercover agents
in Nicaragua to stir up public protest, hoping the leftist
government would overreact.
   Wright, D-Texas, said he did not know if the July 10
demonstration in Nandaime, south of Managua, was the result of U.S.
provocations.
   Scores of people suffered injuries in the Nandaime rally.
Witnesses saw police beat, kick and shove demonstrators with rifle
butts. Officials were injured by rocks hurled by the protesters.
   The Sandinistas later claimed the U.S. Embassy backed the march
and charged the embassy was seeking a plan to undermine the
government. The following day, the U.S. Ambassador, Richard Melton,
was expelled from the country.
   La Prensa was suspended for 15 days and the Roman Catholic radio
station was temporarily shut down.
   Government officials recently have charged that the United
States seeks to justify a reason to approve renewed military aid
for the rebels, who have been fighting to oust the Sandinistas
since 1981.

<HEAD>Government Outlines Laws To Seize Terrorist Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government outlined sweeping
legislation Tuesday to prevent funds reaching terrorists, including
new police powers and a change in bank secrecy laws.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd unveiled the proposals at a police
conference in this northwest resort town. The measures will come
before Parliament next year. Police welcomed them, but civil
libertarians expressed some concern.
   ``The time has come for firm action to throttle the flow of cash
to terrorist organizations,'' Hurd said.
   He said the laws include outlawing handling funds for
terrorists, freezing or confiscating these funds and freeing banks
from secrecy rules so they can inform police of suspect deposits.
   ``We shall draw the definition of `terrorist purposes' wide
enough to catch anyone connected with this trade of death,'' Hurd
said.
   Police ``will be able to seek warrants to get at relevant
material, including bank records of transactions,'' he said.
   The laws would bar handling assets that are ``to be used for
terrorist purposes, even if that activity is going on in an
otherwise legitimate business,'' Hurd said.
   A court convicting a person could ``confiscate any property or
money that he has handled and that is intended for use in terrorist
acts or in connection with terrorism,'' Hurd said, adding the court
would assume the money was tainted ``unless someone with an
interest in it could show otherwise.''
   Anticipating criticism, Hurd said while democracies ``need to
consider long and hard'' before adopting such measures, ``our
conclusion is that the police and the courts must no longer lack
the necessary powers to find and cut off the fuel which sustains
the engines of murder.''
   The proposals were seen mainly as a weapon against the outlawed
Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to rid Northern Ireland of
British rule and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the
95-percent Catholic Irish Republic.
   Sarah Spencer, general secretary of the National Council for
Civil Liberties, objected to making the defendant prove funds were
not destined for terrorist activity, saying: ``In many cases this
could prove an impossible task.''
   Alan Wright, a senior Northern Ireland police official, welcomed
the proposals.
   ``If we can stop the IRA's money at source we can help prevent
them buying arms and explosives,'' he said. ``No organization can
last without funds.''
   Protestant Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist
Party, said the measures were ``too little, too late.'' He said the
restrictions could be dodged by funneling the money to the outlawed
IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein.
   Britain claims one source for the estimated $8.5 million
reaching IRA coffers annually is Noraid, a pro-IRA fund-raising
group in the United States.
   Hurd did not spell out whether the new laws would affect Noraid
contributions, but said bilateral agreements would be sought with
foreign governments to help seize suspect funds.

   A man shot and stabbed his friend to
death, put the body in bed, stole the victim's car and went to see
a horror movie, police said.
   A child sat on the bed watching TV for hours without noticing
the body, police said.
   Bond was set at $250,000 Tuesday for Gary Thiede, 19, who was
arrested Monday night when authorities traced him to a small town
50 miles away, where he had gone to watch ``Nightmare on Elm Street
4: The Dream Master,'' said Jackson County Sheriff Gary Cummings.
   The victim, Robert Aponte, 16, was shot and stabbed about eight
hours earlier.
   Cummings said a baby sitter at Aponte's mother's house told
deputies she thought she heard a shot while Thiede was visiting but
did not investigate.
   When four children arrived home from school they thought Aponte
was asleep, the sheriff said. One sat on the edge of the bed and
Aponte's death went unnoticed for about four hours until his
stepfather called him to supper, Cummings said.
   Investigators were told two guns and the family's station wagon
were missing.
   Thiede was being held in Jackson County Jail in Black River
Falls pending a Friday hearing. District Attorney Jo Deen Lowe said
charges would include first-degree murder, burglary and theft.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Soldiers mutinied and civilian
workers in three state-run companies went on strike Tuesday in what
appeared to be a popular uprising against the vestiges of Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy's ousted regime.
   Radio stations said the revolt spread after the newly installed
government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril failed to expel army
commanders who had been left in place.
   Avril, who declared himself president Sunday after Namphy was
deposed in a military coup, appointed a new armed forces chief
Tuesday and appealed for an end to the unrest. The government also
announced Tuesday night that eight generals were retired.
   Avril said the government was taking steps to satisfy ``the most
urgent demands of the members of the armed forces.''
   But reports of reprisal killings, demonstrations and military
mutinies grew.
   ``I'm afraid we're on the eve of another insurrection,'' a
government official said privately.
   Soldiers around the country mutinied Monday and Tuesday and
removed their commanders, many of whom had served under the three
preceding governments of Namphy, Leslie Manigat and Jean-Claude
Duvalier.
   ``We will chase out of the army all supporters of Namphy,
Manigat and Duvalier,'' a policeman at a station in downtown
Port-au-Prince, where soldiers removed their commander, said on
independent Radio Inter. The army runs the police in Haiti.
   On Tuesday, civilian workers at the state electricity company,
port authority and flour mill went on strike to force the removal
of their state-appointed managers, radio stations said.
   Workers looted and tore apart by hand the house of Jean-Claude
Souriac, head of the electricity company while two armed soldiers
stood by, witnesses said. The flour mill manager also was removed,
radio stations said, but the port authority manager still held his
job late Tuesday.
   The fate of the three managers was not known.
   Radio stations said gunmen killed four people in apparent
reprisal for the Sept. 11 massacre of 13 people during a Mass at a
Roman Catholic church and other atrocities linked to Namphy's
government.
   Ten other people have been reported killed since Avril seized
power. The coup was led by non-commissioned officers and
lower-ranking soldiers in Namphy's own presidential guard. Namphy
was exiled to the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of
Hispaniola with Haiti.
   In apparent attempt to quell the uprising, the government issued
a communique on state television Tuesday night announcing that it
had retired eight generals and promoted four other officers.
   The government said among those retired were Maj. Gen. Williams
Regala, who had been ousted as interior and defense minister after
the coup and has not been seen since, and Brig. Gen. Carl Michel
Nicolas, former army chief of staff.
   Earlier, radio stations reported that mutinying soldiers had
ousted the commanders of the navy, Col. Hebert Valmont; port and
airport security, Col. Fritz Romelus; the crack 300-man Leopards
Batallion, Col. Abelard Denis; and Col. Gambetta Hypollite of the
Artibonite Department, a region north of Port-au-Prince.
   The Confederation of Democratic Unity, a leftist coalition,
called for demonstrations Wednesday in support of the
non-commissioned officers outside the St. John Bosco Church, where
the Sept. 11 massacre took place.
   Soldiers who staged the coup had demanded of the military
command that Avril be put in power, that the military be
reorganized, and that democratic reforms be brought to Haiti,
including free elections, sources said.
   During the ceremony outside the National Palace Tuesday, Avril
said he was aware of ``numerous problems'' within the armed forces,
but urged his troops ``to stay calm, not to adopt attitudes which
may expose the institution to wanton criticisms and affect the
spirit of unity and solidarity which the new government is
seeking.''
   The president, shown on state-run television wearing a dress
uniform, spoke from the palace steps to a gathering of about 200
soldiers representing all units of the 7,000-man Haitian army.
   At the ceremony, Avril announced the appointment of a new armed
forces commander-in-chief, Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, who was
foreign minister under Namphy.
   Abraham's appointment confirmed speculation that Lt. Col.
Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the dreaded 700-man Dessalines
Battalion military unit, would not assume command of the army.
   The United States is seeking Paul's extradition to face federal
drug charges in Florida.
   Namphy led a junta that ran Haiti for most of the 2{ years since
Duvalier was forced into exile in February 1986.
   There was no announcement of an army reorganization during
Avril's address. The announcement had been expected Monday, but a
goverment official said the high command was hesitating to make it,
fearing a loss of its authority.
   It was unclear if that spurred the unrest among soldiers late
Monday and Tuesday.
   After a night of gunfire and violence in Port-au-Prince,
non-commissioned officers and troops of the 4th Company in downtown
Port-au-Prince on Tuesday arrested their commander, Maj. Renaud
Symbert, and deposited him unharmed outside the downtown army
headquarters, radio stations said.
   They said gunfire was heard at the army compound in Mirebalais,
about 25 miles northwest of the capital, as soldiers mutinied
against their commander, Lt. Simeon Francois. The lieutenant fled.
   Radio stations said soldiers revolted at the Toussaint
Louverture Barracks in Gonaives, 100 miles north of the capital, on
Tuesday, chasing out their captain and demanding the ouster of the
military commander.
   It was reported that thousands of people demonstrated in
Gonaives in support of the mutiny.
   Soldiers at the National Penitentiary in downtown Port-au-Prince
also mutinied Tuesday, expelling the warden, Lt. Paul Joseph, whom
they accused of misconduct.
   On Monday, troops of the Leopards Battalion handcuffed their
leader, Denis, to the entrance of army headquarters. Firing
automatic weapons triumphantly into the air, they sped in vehicles
back to their compound, near the wealthy suburb of Petionville.
   Soldiers of the 160-man Aviation Corps also briefly detained
their commander Monday before expelling him from their base in
Port-au-Prince.
   Meanwhile, Radio Metropole said unidentified gunmen on Tuesday
killed police Detective Henri Toussaint and three other men.
   Toussaint was widely reputed to have been a member of Duvalier's
dreaded Tonton Macoutes secret police force, which terrorized the
population during the 29-year Duvalier regime.
   Avril told the nation Monday he had appointed 11 civilians and
one army officer to the Cabinet ``for the definitive installation
of democracy.'' He made no mention of plans for free elections.

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Helene Forms in Eastern Atlantic</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with potential for hurricane development,
new location, wind speed, quotes</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

   Tropical Storm Helene formed in the eastern
Atlantic on Tuesday and showed potential for strengthening into a
hurricane in the next day or two, the National Hurricane Center
reported.
   Helene is the eighth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season and the first since Hurricane Gilbert formed in the
Caribbean and went on to ravage Jamaica and Mexico.
   Helene's winds, based on satellite photos, reached 60 mph
Tuesday and was moving west at about 15 mph, according an advisory
from the hurricane center.
   Meteorologist Randy Lascody said a storm path cannot be
projected until it moves closer to the Caribbean.
   ``It's going across the warmest water of the year now, which is
perfect to fuel its growth,'' Lascody said Tuesday night. ``But it
really would be very premature to give a guess on what may happen.
It still has a long way to go.''
   Storms that form this month near the Cape Verde Islands off
Africa's coast are often the season's strongest because of ideal
hurricane-spawning conditions, forecasters say.
   Factors such as low-pressure zones in the Caribbean and
high-level winds will affect the path of the storm, said Lascody.
   ``It looks like it will reach its make-or-break point sometime
later this week,'' he said.
   The depression that became Helene had initially seemed
disorganized, but satellite photos showed circulation had improved.
   The hurricane center has not yet received ship reports on the
storm's intensity.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Helene's center was located 1,500 miles east
of the Lesser Antilles at latitude 12 north, longitude 37.8 west.
   It will take about four days for Helene to get close enough to
the Caribbean to allow an Air Force reconnaissance plane to overfly
the storm. Until then, hurricane forecasters will have to rely on
satellite reports, said forecaster Miles Lawrence.
   He emphasized there was no way to tell if Helene would become as
powerful as the deadly Gilbert, which forecasters have called the
storm of the century.
   Gilbert, which had winds about 175 mph at its peak, did not
reach tropical storm strength until reaching the Caribbean.

   President Reagan welcomed Senate approval of a
free-trade agreement with Canada as a prelude to a new surge of
economic growth in both countries, but the accord's future is
clouded by political conflict in Ottawa.
   ``It will benefit our people for generations to come,'' Reagan
said Monday following 83-9 Senate approval of the agreement with
America's top trading partner.
   ``The agreement will create jobs and stimulate economic growth
on both sides of the border and create the largest open market in
the world,'' he said.
   The Senate approved not only the agreement signed Jan. 2 by
Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney but also a bill
that would set the stage for the 10-year phaseout of tariffs called
for under the pact.

   For all the grand designs of the presidential
nominees, a large number of Americans believe neither candidate
could deliver on most of his campaign promises, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   About half the 1,125 adults in the national survey saw both men
as strong leaders, with Michael Dukakis rated by more as
compassionate and George Bush rated by more as competent to manage
the federal government.
   But just 36 percent said Bush could accomplish most of his
stated goals in office, and only 31 percent said Dukakis could do
most of what he wants. Nearly half said either would be stymied in
office; the rest were unsure.

   Marilyn Quayle has done ``20@20.'' Her husband
Dan, the Republican running for the country's No. 2 job, has not.
He sometimes stumbles over his words. She never does.
   He can freeze when a reporter asks an unexpected question. She
is always prepared, and the only frozen look is the one she icily
bestows on an unfriendly questioner.
   Mrs. Quayle, who is on her first solo national campaign swing
this week, is considered one of the stronger assets of her
husband's campaign.
   Her skills, said a senior campaign official, have ``been
recognized'' and she has been asked to travel independently,
hooking up with the Indiana senator for joint appearances one or
two days each week.
   At 39, Mrs. Quayle is a self-possessed woman whose flip hairdo
and toothy smile evoke early Mary Tyler Moore. She is a mother of
three and a lawyer, although she hasn't practiced for some years.

   For five homeless years on New York City's mean
streets, Chris Martin said he turned dozens of $5 tricks a day with
other men to feed his crack habit, slept in a salt-filled warehouse
and washed in a fire hydrant.
   ``I was selling my body for drugs. I was in a dead end zone,''
Martin said Monday.
   ``It was a scary life. You're on your own. Nobody's there to
guide you. You don't care where you sleep,'' he said. ``I couldn't
trust nobody. I couldn't trust myself.''
   Martin, who left home at age 15, is one of an estimated 10,000
homeless youths in New York City, according to Covenant House, an
advocacy group founded 20 years to shelter and feed teen-agers who
ran away or were abandoned by their parents.
   Children under 18 are the fastest growing segment of the
homeless population, according to an estimate released Monday by

demands for Armenian annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh, where reports
said a curfew was imposed and a bomb damaged a workers' dormitory.
   New violence hit the disputed territory over the weekend, with

   An improving trade deficit helped economic
growth remain strong in the second quarter despite the Farm Belt
drought, but inflation was more severe than previously believed,
the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of the nation's $4 trillion economy, grew at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.0 percent in the April-June
period. That was slower than the 3.4 percent expansion rate in the
first quarter, but still brisk.
   If not for the drought, second-quarter growth would have been a
more robust 3.9 percent. Crop and livestock losses for the year are
estimated at $13.9 billion and will be even more of a drag on the
economy in the third and fourth quarters.

<HEAD>Ken Wahl: Acting is Just a Job, Thanks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ken Wahl does not behave like a TV star.
   He would consider that a high compliment.
   On a recent visit to New York to participate begrudgingly in a
minimal amount of publicity for his show, CBS' ``Wiseguy,'' he
plopped down in a hotel dining room chair in long hair, baseball
cap and faded denim jacket. The disguise helps him avoid the public
attention that makes him uncomfortable.
   Wahl avoids the glitter of show business like the plague. When
not working on the series, which is filmed in Vancouver, he lives
in Boston with his wife and kids. And he doesn't hang out with
other actors.
   ``I'm just an actor when the camera's on,'' he said. ``The rest
of the time I'm just Kenny, and I just do what I do. I like it that
way.''
   Wahl, who grew up in Chicago, had aspired to be a professional
baseball player, but an injury ended that dream. When he was 19 and
going nowhere, he decided he had nothing to lose by driving out to
Los Angeles to try acting. It looked like a better job than
stacking auto parts.
   ``When I'd come home from work, you know, I'd watch television
like every other average guy, go to the movies occasionally, and I
just wasn't intimidated by it,'' he said. ``It just didn't seem
like it was that big of a deal, that it shouldn't be all that
difficult.
   ``I figured, well, I can't play baseball, I didn't have an
opportunity to go to college or anything, so I thought I'd give it
a shot, I had nothin' to lose, and I got lucky.''
   That's the kind of luck that other actors spend lifetimes wiping
bars and waiting tables for.
   ``That's why I don't hang out with them,'' Wahl said. ``There's
a lot of sour grapes. ... I don't need the aggravation. I say,
`What am I supposed to do, not do it because you waited tables for
15 years?' I didn't tell you to do that. That's why I set the time
limit, because I didn't want to be one of those people who would
wait tables for 10 or 15 years waiting for the big break to happen,
because a lot of them are real bitter, and I just don't want to
live life that way.''
   Wahl gave himself 18 months to make it, or go back to Chicago
and pick a trade school. But he quickly landed his first starring
role, in the movie ``The Wanderers.'' He later had a supporting
role in the Paul Newman movie ``Fort Apache, The Bronx,'' starred
opposite Bette Midler in ``Jinxed,'' then opposite Cheryl Ladd in
``Purple Hearts.''
   In the critically praised ``Wiseguy,'' Wahl stars as Vinnie
Terranova, an agent of the Organized Crime Bureau who goes so deep
undercover he is sometimes tempted to go over the line. The show
languished in the ratings its first season but picked up viewers in
summer reruns and will be back this season.
   Wahl says even if the series became a big hit, he would prefer
to walk away in about three years rather than dragging it on as
long as anybody will watch.
   He'd like to go back to movies, because _ ever the pragmatist _
they're less work. And don't look to see him on a stage anytime
soon. He's never been on one and says he's only seen three or four
plays in his whole life.
   ``I've gotten in trouble with this before, so I have to
explain,'' he said. ``Just because I'm pragmatic about this
occupation doesn't mean that I don't take it seriously. I mean, I
do to the extent that I try to do the best job that I can. ... I
just keep it on an occupational level. I don't take it to another
level of being all artistic and everything.
   ``If somebody else wants to think it's artistic, well, that's
fine. But to me, it's my job. I'm supposed to do it well. If I
don't do it well, I won't be able to continue to work. And then you
get hungry. And that's my point.''

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Steve Falacy saw
open flames near the Virginia Cascade in fire-ravaged Yellowstone
National Park recently, he stopped his truck, ran into the
blackened woods with a shovel and attacked the hot spots.
   ``I'm from Montana and I won't let it burn anymore,'' said
Falacy, who grew up in Missoula and lives in Albuquerque, N.M.
   He shouldn't have done it, because he had no firefighting gear
or protective clothing and because snags are dangerous, but his
wife, Becky, said she couldn't stop him.
   ``He's really upset,'' she said.
   The Falacys were in Yellowstone to check out the damage from the
worst forest fires in centuries. Nearly half the park's 2.2 million
acres have been charred by wildfires this summer.
   ``It was about what I expected, but Steve just couldn't take it
when he saw the flames,'' Becky Falacy said. ``He saw flames and
went right down there. You couldn't stop him.''
   Falacy's typified the reactions of people from the Yellowstone
neighborhood _ the states of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.
   ``I didn't realize how much damage there is until we saw it for
ourselves,'' said Bonnie Townsend, of Bozeman, Mont. ``It was bad
enough reading about it. This is so awful I can't describe it.''
   Living near the nation's oldest national park generates a
proprietary interest in its welfare, and there is much anger over
the events of the summer.
   However, tourists from distant parts of the United States and
overseas are less emotional about the damage and say they expected
to see far worse.
   ``When it all grows back it will be twice as pretty,'' said Jack
Quiggle, of Huntington Beach, Calif.
   Quiggle said television coverage of the fires had led him to
believe that ``all I'd see was burned trees. They made it sound
like the whole park was scorched to the ground.''
   Forest fires burn in a scattered pattern called a mosaic by
foresters. Acres of blackened trees are interspersed with untouched
stands. Other sections are burned at ground level, but foliage is
untouched.
   Many of the park's most popular attractions have escaped the
fires. No damage is visible at the falls near Canyon, Artist Point
and the north shore of Yellowstone Lake. Old Faithful, however, is
partially surrounded by scorched trees.
   A tour group from Australia marveled at the parts of the park
that remain _ at least so far _ undamaged.
   ``We thought it might be worse,'' said Val Ellerington of
Cokedale, New South Wales. ``But it's a beautiful place.
   ``We've been able to see the falls and Old Faithful and what we
wanted to see, and we're so glad we could see Yellowstone at all,''
she said.
   Milton and Marie Wright of Nashville, Tenn., said they, too,
expected more damage.
   Gazing out over the spectacular canyon and the falls of the
Yellowstone River, Marie Wright said she hated to see the burned
trees visible from some roads, but wasn't disappointed with the
park.
   ``The main reason to come to the park is the things like Old
Faithful, the canyon, animals and geysers, and all these things are

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a host of issues, from Star Wars and
student aid to child care and the Nicaraguan Contras, Republican
George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis offer voters clear
distinctions on where and how they would lead the country as the
next president.
   But in many areas, including how they propose to reduce the huge
federal budget deficit or provide long-term health care for the
elderly, each candidate has been purposely vague _ especially about
the cost of their good intentions.
   As they prepare for a head-on collision on the issues in their
first nationally televised debate Sunday night in Winston-Salem,
N.C., here is a look at the major stands of the Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush's response to the question of tax increases consists of
three words: ``No, no, no.'' He has vowed, ``I won't raise your
taxes, period.'' He proposes to lower the 28 percent capital gains
tax to 15 percent. Dukakis says that would cost the Treasury $30
billion or more, but the vice president contends it will generate
more revenue than it loses. Bush also has suggested expensive new
tax credits for oil and gas exploration and child care.
   Dukakis says, ``No serious candidate for the presidency can rule
out the possibility that we will need new taxes to get our budget
deficit down and our economy back on track.'' His first target: a
crackdown on tax evaders who he says cheat the Treasury out of $110
billion a year. If taxes prove necessary as a last resort, Dukakis
says, ``I would see that they are raised on the basis of the
ability to pay.'' He opposes a cut in the capital gains tax,
calling it a tax break for the wealthy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFICIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush's solution to the annual $150 billion federal deficit is a
so-called ``flexible freeze'' on all federal spending except Social
Security. It would allow government programs, including defense, to
grow no faster than inflation. Some would have to be cut to allow
for spending increases that Bush has promised for education, child
care and other initiatives, but he has not specified where the cuts
would come. He favors a line-item veto and a balanced budget
amendment to the Constitution. ``The most important action we need
to take on the budget deficit is to hold the line on taxing and
spending,'' Bush says.
   Dukakis promises to make ``tough choices'' on spending, but for
the most part refuses to say where the ax would fall. He opposes a
balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, but favors line-item
veto authority for the president. He has said he does not envision
major cuts in domestic programs, and has hinted that any savings
from cutting back on the Strategic Defense Initiative and such
weapons as the rail-based mobile MX missile and Midgetman missile
would be offset by a buildup in conventional weapons. ``There are
only four ways to reduce the budget deficit: cut spending, increase
revenue, bring down interest rates and improve economic
performance,'' he said. ``We must do all four.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFENSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush says, ``I believe that the (Reagan) administration's
approach in rebuilding America's defenses is fundamentally
correct.'' He has not suggested scrapping any Pentagon weapons
systems, although he says the proposed single-warhead Midgetman
missile would be costly. He promises to press ahead with research
and eventual deployment of SDI, or Star Wars, the space-based
missile defense system, although he cautions that a full deployment
would be ``very expensive.''
   Dukakis opposes the rail-based MX missile. He says the Midgetman
is strategically sound, but very costly. He is against plans to
build two more Navy aircraft carrier task forces at a cost of $18
billion each. He has called Star Wars ``a fantasy'' and says he
would reduce its research budget to $1 billion. Dukakis says
Republican mismanagement has left the military short of tanks,
artillery and other conventional weapons. He supports the Stealth
bomber, Trident II submarine-based missiles, the advanced tactical
fighter, the SS-21 Sea Wolf fast-attack submarine and advanced
cruise missiles, as well as more tanks and artillery.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHILD CARE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush, who says he wants ``a kinder and gentler nation,'' has
proposed a $2.2 billion federal income tax credit for low-income
and middle-income families up to $20,000 a year to help pay
child-care costs. The credit of up to $1,000 per child under age 4
would be refundable for parents who don't earn enough to pay income
taxes. All low-income families with at least one working parent
would be eligible; the care could be provided by family, friends or
in any type of day-care facility, including those run by churches
and synagogues.
   Dukakis has endorsed the concept, but has not committed himself
to the cost, of a $2.5 billion, Democratic-sponsored bill that
would funnel child-care aid to families earning up to 115 percent
of median state income. The measure would establish and expand
child-care facilities nationally, with a national advisory
committee establishing minimimum health and safety standards for
both day-care centers and homes. The bill has run into snags in
Congress over restrictions on church-based day care.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both candidates say they personally are not in favor of
abortion. But Bush supports a constitutional amendment that would
ban abortion except to save the life of the mother or in cases of
rape or incest. Bush supports government financing of abortions
only to save the mother's life.
   Dukakis opposes efforts to outlaw abortion, saying the matter
should be left for women and their doctors to decide. He supports
government financing of abortions for the poor.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush says, ``Continued research on the virus combined with
public education and testing are the best path to curb the spread
of AIDS.'' He has said, ``We may have to spend even more'' in the
AIDS fight than the government's current budget of nearly $1
billion. He has urged states to routinely test marriage license
applicants, patients at clinics treating sexually transmitted
disease or drug abuse, and prison inmates. Records must be kept
``appropriately confidential.'' Bush says children should be taught
``essential facts about AIDS in a thoughful, sensitive manner,''
and children who carry the virus should be allowed to stay in
public classrooms with proper safeguards.
   Dukakis promises to ``commit the resources necessary to prevent
the spread of the virus, find a cure, develop a vaccine and care
for people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.'' He says he will
lead a ``massive public education campaign'' and teach the public
``about both the facts and the myths of this terrible disease.'' He
supports federal legislation to protect AIDS patients against
discrimination and impose penalties ``for violating people's
confidentiality.'' He supports mandatory testing in the military
and of immigrants from countries with high incidence of AIDS, as
well as in blood, sperm and organ donor banks.

   ^ENVIRONMENT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush says, ``In the past few years, we have not done enough to
protect the environment. I will do more.'' He promises to seek an
end to ocean dumping of wastes by 1991, a goal of ``no net loss of
wetlands'' and a moratorium on offshore oil drilling in sensitive
areas such as the Northern California coast. He also says he will
seek to curb acid rain by finding ways to cut ``millions of tons of
sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000 and to significantly
reduce nitrogen oxide emissions,'' and to accelerate the Superfund
cleanup of toxic wastes.
   Dukakis says he will set and enforce strict standards for air
and water quality and strengthen the Environmental Protection
Agency to ``make the polluters pay.'' He says he will work with
Congress ``to stop the acid rain pollution of North American skies
and waters.'' He promises to ``halt below-cost timber sales in
national forests'' and he opposes offshore drilling in
environmentally sensitive areas, including the Georges Bank off New
England.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush calls drugs ``a cancer on our society'' and says he will
make his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, czar of an
administration-wide assault on drugs. ``We have had some good
results in stopping this poison at the borders. But drug abuse must
be attacked not only by stopping the supply, but also by stopping
the demand,'' says Bush. ``We have to educate our children about
the dangers of drugs.''
   Dukakis says he will wage ``a real war, not a phony war, against
drugs.'' He promises to appoint a federal czar to oversee the
nation's drug enforcement, rehabilitation and education efforts.
Dukakis vows to cut off foreign aid to governments that refuse to
cooperate with U.S. efforts, hire 600 more Drug Enforcement
Administration agents and strengthen the Coast Guard and Customs
Service, and dispatch the U.S. military ``under appropriate
circumstances'' to help foreign governments eradicate drug crops
and drug processing labs. He promises to expand aid for drug
treatment clinics to make space available for any addict who wants
to kick the habit.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENERGY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush, a former oilman, has proposed a 10 percent tax credit for
oil and gas exploration. He wants to fully decontrol natural gas
prices, use more coal as an energy source and fill up the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve faster. He says nuclear power ``must be a part of
our energy mix.'' He opposes an oil import fee. He says, ``There is
no way to meet our energy requirements without offshore drilling,''
but some sensitive tracts should not be leased.
   Dukakis opposes the construction of new commercial nuclear
reactors until new reactors are designed and safe ways are found to
treat and dispose of radioactive wastes. He also would fill the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He says the United States must become
less dependent on imported oil. ``We must use cleaner fuels, like
natural gas, and better technologies, like clean coal. And we must
promote alternatives to fossil fuels and significantly increase
energy efficiency and conservation,'' he says. Dukakis, too,
opposes an oil import fee.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Each candidate says he wants to be ``the education president.''
   Bush has promised to spend more on Head Start, the preschool
program for needy children, and to increase the education budget by
$600 million, including a new ``Merit Schools'' program that would
reward schools that make strides in educating the disadvantaged.
Bush also has proposed allowing parents to earn interest tax-free
on U.S. savings bonds.
   Dukakis has said he favors creating a $250 million National
Teaching Excellence Fund to attract people to teaching with
scholarships, sabbaticals and other incentives. He says he is
committed to the principle that no qualified student should be
denied a college education because of financial need. He has
proposed allowing students to borrow money for college and pay it
back through a payroll withholding tax throughout their working
lives. He promises to work in partnership with the private sector
to eliminate adult illiteracy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HEALTH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush says, ``We must mount a comprehensive effort to reduce the
cost and improve the quality of, and access to, health care in
America.'' He says Medicare may be able to save money by extending
its prospective payment system for hospitals to physician and
outpatient services, but he is wary of ``regulatory schemes that
could have the unintended effect of lowering the quality of health
care.'' Bush favors tax incentives to encourage people to save for
their own long-term costs in nursing homes. He says elderly couples
should not have to bankrupt themselves before qualifying for
government help.
   The centerpiece of Dukakis' health program is a promise to make
basic health insurance available to all American workers, with
their employers footing the bill. Massachusetts recently became the
first state to impose such a requirement on all but the smallest
employers. Dukakis maintains this can be done at no cost to the
federal government. Business groups contend it would cost employers
heavily and result in job losses. Dukakis says he also is committed
to the goal of ensuring that all the elderly have access to
long-term care. ``With a $150 billion federal budget deficit, we
will not realize this goal overnight. But we must begin now, with
commitment and compassion,'' Dukakis says.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush suports the death penalty ``for crimes involving murder,
treason or espionage,'' as well as for narcotics kingpins. Dukakis
opposes capital punishment under any circumstances.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SCHOOL PRAYER</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush supports organized, voluntary prayer in public schools ``as
an extension of our commitment to teaching values.'' Dukakis
opposes prayer in public schools.

   Schlumberger Ltd. said Monday its board had
approved a plan to buy back 30 million of its common shares at a
cost that could top $975 million.
   The giant oilfield services company said shareholders will be
invited to tender shares in a ``Dutch auction,'' in which
stockholders specify the price they want for their shares, between
$32.50 and $37 per share.
   Based on the prices sought for the tendered shares, the company
will select a single purchase price and will pay that price for 30
million shares tendered at or below that level.
   The program begins Tuesday and ends Oct. 18, unless extended.
   Schlumberger shares closed at $32.25 on Monday, down 62{ cents
in New York Stock Exchange trading. The company has 272.2 million
common shares outstanding.

   The Senate has approved a landmark free-trade

   More bad news about an oversupply of oil on
world markets overshadowed a mixed performance in energy futures.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
16 cents higher at $14.73 a barrel Monday after a late-afternoon
rally in anticipation of the contract's expiration on Tuesday.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.02
cent to close at 44.24 cents a gallon.
   The October wholesale heating oil contract lost 0.01 cent to
settle at 41.36 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said the market opened lower, influenced by a report
that Saudi Arabia intentionally was violating its production quota
in a direct challenge to the 12 other nations of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a respected industry
newsletter, said the quota violation was a Saudi strategy ahead of
next week's meeting of the cartel's price monitoring committee to
bring other quota violators back in line with OPEC pricing policy
by competing with them for market share.
   The meeting is scheduled for Sept. 25 and 26, either in Vienna
or on the Indonesian island of Bali, according to reports.
   Saudi Arabia is OPEC's largest oil producer and once was
considered the swing producer, and in a position to influence other
OPEC members. But recently, some analysts have questioned Saudi
Arabia's leadership role.
   Iraq, for example, has refused to abide by an OPEC-imposed
quota, saying it needs the oil revenue to rebuild its war-torn
country. Other member nations also have admitted violating output
limits.
   Analysts said the market interpreted the Saudi report
negatively. They said last week's optimism that an OPEC price
meeting could lead to production limits and higher oil prices has
now turned mixed.
   Analysts also said Monday that gasoline futures were
surprisingly weak after last week's rally brought on by the threat
of a hurricane disrupting production in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``I guess it was an overbought market,'' said Richard Kane, an
oil broker with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the government's latest auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.17 percent on Monday, down from
7.21 percent last week. Another $7.0 billion was sold in six-month
bills at an average discount rate of 7.34 percent, down from 7.41
percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.05
percent on Aug. 15 and six-month bills averaged 7.26 on Aug. 8.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.40 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,818.80 and and 7.73 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,628.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 8.01
percent last week after averaging 8.09 percent the week before.

   World finance officials begin arriving this week
for the annual World Bank-International Monetary Fund meeting,
which is expected to be more a forum for discussion of economic
ailments than a producer of any historic policy decisions.
   Finance ministers, central bankers and other officials from 151
countries are expected to attend the joint meeting, the first ever
held in Germany.
   Representatives of the countries will present their nations'
positions on various economic issues at a plenary session scheduled
for Sept. 27-29.
   Preliminary talks that include a meeting of officials of the
world's seven largest industrial democracies _ the so-called Group
of Seven _ begin Thursday.
   Coincidentally, Thursday is the three-year anniversary of the
so-called Plaza Agreement in New York, in which the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain and France agreed to depress the
dollar's foreign exchange value to help curb the U.S. trade deficit.
   Since then, the dollar has declined by nearly 45 percent against
the Japanese yen, a move cited as a key factor in cutting the
deficit over that time.
   Also during the West Berlin discussions, the G-7 nations are
slated to review their economic coordination policies. The Group of
Seven comprises the United States, West Germany, Japan, Canada,
France, Britain and Italy.
   Observers say the Group of Seven likely will reaffirm its
intention to keep the dollar steady at around current levels and
restate its belief that an excessive rise or fall of the dollar
would be counterproductive to world economies.
   World Bank and IMF officials and private economists say the
importance of the Berlin meeting is not its results, but the new
ideas it produces.
   ``I don't think there will be any major decisions, but there
should be a lively exchange of new ideas,'' Peter Pietsch,
economist for the Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in an interview.
   Helmut Hartmann, an IMF spokesman, told reporters last week:
``We expect no historical decisions.''
   Also scheduled to meet this week on Thursday are deputy finance
ministers of the Group of 24 developing countries.
   The plight of heavily indebted developing nations is expected to
be a major topic during the Berlin talks.
   According to IMF annual report released Sept. 14, the industrial
nations are in good financial health but the overall situation
among developing countries remains far from satisfactory.
   The IMF report said total debt of the developing countries
increased 10.4 percent in 1987 from the previous year to $1.2
trillion, while their average growth rage fell to 3.4 percent in
1987 from 4.2 percent in 1986.
   The Third World debt issue likely will be dramatized in West
Berlin by protests expected to be staged concurrently with the
finance meetings. About 40,000 protesters have said they will come
to West Berlin to denounce what they see as unfair treatment of the
developing nations by richer industrialized lands and calling for
general Third World debt relief, according to organizers.
   Industrialized nations and private banks have been encouraging
developing countries to undertake economic reform in exchange for
help with their debts. Pietsch, the West German economist, says
that strategy continues to show the most promise.
   However, some indebted nations have called for more sweeping
solutions to their problem, including partial or whole debt
forgiveness.
   ``A general debt relief would not help to stabilize economies
and societies,'' Pietsch said.
   ``We need to be flexible and look for new instruments (to help
reduce developing countries' debts). The debt countries are also
creating lots of innovations in order to overcome their problems,''
he said.
   French Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy has indicated that
during the West Berlin discussions he plans to unveil a proposal
aimed at encouraging banks to step up their lending to
middle-income debtors.
   Other topics likely to be discussed during the meeting are the
U.S. trade and budget deficits, protectionism and high inflation in
Latin America.
   The United States, represented by its newly appointed Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, is expected to stress that the next U.S.
president would continue the nation's cooperation with the rest of
the G-7 countries.
   There also could be discussion of a possible Soviet entry in the
IMF.
   Hans Klein, West Germany's minister for economic cooperation,
said last week he would be ``extremely happy'' with such a move,
which he said likely would speed up structural economic reform
within the Soviet Union.

   Its inventor says the Baby Bag was born
of desperation.
   In years past, Elizabeth Andrews would have to grit her teeth
and try stuffing her 4-month-old daughter Jesse into a snowsuit
while the child twisted, kicked and screamed until her veins bulged.
   Bundled and ready, Jesse needed a diaper change; once outdoors,
her mittens fell off, creating another trauma.
   This was no way to enjoy winter, Andrews thought.
   Some type of bag-like outfit would be more convenient and more
protective of the baby's face. So Andrews stitched together a cozy
little bunting sack to replace the traditional snowsuit, called it
Baby Bag and began selling the insulated outfit in stores. It was
an immediate success.
   ``It's a good product to sell because it's a very simple design,
and the (promotional) pictures are always cute because the babies
are cute,'' Andrews said during a recent interview at her office in
this Portland suburb.
   In 1980 _ a year after she began selling the bunting suits _
Andrews and husband Ben Ellison formed Baby Bag Co. They sold 681
bags that winter.
   The company now sells more than 30,000 bags a year and has
recorded annual revenue over $500,000. Andrews also has expanded
the company's facilities in Maine, expanded her product line, added
a manufacturer in Seattle and begun to set up marketing in Europe.
   The bag _ which retails for $30 to $40 _ is displayed in several
catalogs nationwide and sells in about 800 stores in the United
States and Canada. It has been written up in Good Housekeeping and
Parents magazines, and was displayed among several new consumer
products on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program.
   Using the bag is relatively easy. Parents can slide a child in
and out of the bag without the pushing and pulling associated with
tight-fitting snowsuits.
   The baby is warmed by its own body heat, which rises from the
bottom of the bag. Loosening the strings at the top of the suit
provides ventilation without having to undress a baby, as with
traditional snowsuits.
   Andrews, 39, says the outfit was born of desperation. Just the
sight of a snowsuit coming out of the closet sent her daughter into
a 15-minute tantrum.
   ``I needed something to pop her in and get outside quickly
because once she was outside she was fine,'' Andrews said.
   Andrews' sewing experience was limited to repairing a few sails
on the sloop she and her husband operated as a charter boat.
Undaunted, she stitched a prototype one-piece suit that drew
favorable comments from people who noticed the curious attire.
   She hired a Camden tent company to make the bags she distributed
to friends, who encouraged her and her husband to open a business.
   They patented the bag and tried to persuade the outdoor
outfitter L.L. Bean, based in nearby Freeport, to buy their idea
and manufacture the product. But the company turned them down,
saying Andrews and her husband should develop the product
themselves.
   With a few magazine advertisements, a $5,000 bank loan and 500
baby bags manufactured by a local sportswear company, the couple
began a mail-order business at home in 1980. Telephone orders
poured in day and night from around the country.
   Soon after, a product buyer at L.L. Bean helped Andrews improve
her idea, and the outfitter finally agreed to carry the bag in a
December 1983 mail-order catalog. The backing from L.L Bean,
coupled with a few magazine ads and displays at trade shows, pushed
annual sales to $350,000 by the spring of 1984. While her business
succeeded, Andrews' marriage fell apart. She sold the mail-order
division to another Maine company, Good Gear For Little People, but
was frightened by the prospect of managing a wholesale business
alone.
   ``I was a child of the 60's who never thought I would ever have
to be serious about anything,'' she said. ``I had never been a
person with a purpose or a goal.''
   The warm and cheerful Andrews says she adopted a slightly
sharper edge following her divorce, quickly realizing that
companies took her product more seriously once they saw she was
assertive and persistent.
   Last year, she moved the business to Cumberland, where she lives
with Jesse, now 10, and her second husband, Leonard Krill.
   They renovated their barn into offices where Andrews, dressed in
jeans and running shoes, scurries around with her three employees
managing a line of products that now includes mittens, booties,
snowcuffs for ankles, hooded jackets and pants.
   The products are made in Fryeburg by stitchers for a sportswear
company who work part-time for Andrews. They can produce about
7,000 Baby Bags a month and thousands of the other accessories.
   Andrews chuckles at her success, calling it ``a real story about
how people who don't know anything about anything can do
something.''

<HEAD>NYSE Member Firms Report Drop in Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 41 percent of the New York Stock
Exchange member firms doing public business lost money during the
second quarter, even though overall the firms' profit rose by 26.7
percent during the period.
   The exchange reported Monday that the investment companies had
after-tax earnings of $365 million, compared with a profit of $288
million in the same period of 1987.
   The 226 profitable companies had aggregate pre-tax earnings of
$813 million, while the 160 unprofitable firms lost an aggregate
$261 million, the report said.
   Revenue of the 386 companies was down slightly, dropping to
$12.449 billion from $12.603 billion a year ago. The firms had
revenue of $13.015 billion in the first quarter.
   Jeff Schaefer, senior vice president at the Securities Industry
Association, said inflation pressures and concerns about higher
interest rates had a negative effect on the securities business.
   ``In addition to lower volume, there was a lowering of
securities prices in both the fixed income and equity markets,''
Schaefer said. ``And that's very important, because what determines
commissions and trading profits are security prices.''
   The NYSE said the after-tax profit in the second quarter
represented a 4.0 percent annual return on member firms' average
net worth of $36.66 billion.
   Commission revenue amounted to 17.9 percent of total revenues in
the second quarter, down from 18.6 percent in the first quarter,
the report said. Member firms' assets rose 5.7 percent to $456.4
billion from $431.6 billion in the first quarter.
   Capital, which includes ownership equity and subordinated
liabilities, rose 2.1 percent from the previous quarter to a record
$37.04 billion. First quarter capital was $36.275 billion.
   The exchange said its specialist firms, which make markets for
the stocks traded on the NYSE floor, saw their aggregate after-tax
profit drop to $30 million in the second quarter. That was down 36
percent from $47 million in the same period last year and off 55
percent from $55 million in the first quarter.
   The NYSE said the specialists had a 12.3 percent after-tax
return on capital in the quarter, compared with 17.7 percent in the
same period last year and 22.3 percent in the first quarter.

<BYLINE>Bank Group President: Taxpayers, Not Banks, Should Bail Out
Thrifts</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxpayers _ not a bank-financed
insurance fund _ should pay for the multi-billion dollar bailout of
insolvent savings and loans, according to the president of the
American Bankers Association.
   Charles Pistor told Iowa bankers Monday there was no alternative
but to use taxpayer money because of the large and rapidly growing
problem of insolvencies of thrifts and the deterioration of the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the agency that insures
deposits in S&L's.
   He said Congress should ``accept the facts of life'' that the
problem requires taxpayer support.
   Pistor was equally adamant in opposing the use of funds from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures bank deposits, to
help foot the bill.
   ``The FDIC wasn't created to bail out insolvent thrifts,'' he
told the bankers.
   While deregulation has blurred many of the former distinctions
between commercial banks and thrifts, each institution has its own
regulatory and insurance systems.
   The FDIC insures an individual's deposits of up to $100,000 at
commercial banks and the FSLIC provides similar insurance at
thrifts. The insurance funds are supported by premiums paid by the
insured financial institutions.
   Pistor, who also is chairman of NorthPark National Bank in
Dallas, said an ABA committee would recommend today not only that
tax funds be used to deal with the growing problem, but that the
government step in to halt the growth of the insolvencies and to
increase the pace of liquidating insolvent thrifts.
   Pistor said the report to be released today in Washington would
blame the growth in thrift insolvencies on inadequate regulation
and supervision.
   The deterioration of the thrift industry and the FSLIC will be
the single most dominant financial issue for bankers in 1989,
Pistor said.
   He estimated the bailout would cost $50 billion to $100 billion,
considerably more than predicted by the federal government's
General Accounting Office. The GAO estimated last week that the
cost of merging, closing or disposing of insolvent thrifts would be
in the range of $45 billion to $50 billion.
   He said that while banks and thrifts were separate entities,
``this is a bank problem,'' and the cost of coping with it is
rising by $1 billion a month.
   ``Bankers across the country are concerned there could be a
Saturday night massacre'' in which Congress would merge the $18
billion FDIC fund with the FSLIC, he said in an interview before
his speech. ``We are worried there could be confiscation of a fund
built up by us.''
   Bankers also are worried, Pistor told reporters, because the
practice of allowing insolvent thrifts to continue operating was
cutting into profits.
   ``So-called brain-dead thrifts are paying excessive interest
rates'' to attract depositors, forcing banks to compete and driving
up the cost of raising money, he said.
   ``Our banks feel the pressure when insolvent thrifts build up
credit costs,'' he told the convention.
   Over the long term, he said, Congress should bring thrift
regulations up to the same standards that exist for banks and
should permit bank holding companies to acquire and operate thrifts.

<TEXT>
   CSX Corp.'s decision to sell some of its
major holdings and repurchase up to 38 percent of its outstanding
stock is designed to return the company to its railroad roots, CSX
officials say.
   ``The restructuring program evidences our continued commitment
to increasing stockholder value by concentrating our resources on
our core transportation businesses,'' said Hays T. Watkins,
chairman of the Richmond-based transportation holding company.
   Watkins said Monday that CSX believed the firm's common stock
was an attractive investment, but said ``the repurchase plan will
permit stockholders who desire to sell their stock an opportunity
to do so at a premium over the current market price.''
   CSX, parent company of CSX Transportation, CSX Energy, CSX
Properties and CSX Technology, will repurchase up to 60 million
shares of common stock beginning this week.
   Each CSX shareholder will be invited to tender shares at prices
specified by the shareholder, ranging from $28 to $33 per share.
The company will select a single purchase price and will pay that
price for up to 40 million shares tendered at or below that level.
   The stock repurchase will be funded with cash and short-term
borrowings, CSX said.
   CSX also will sell its natural gas transmission and natural gas
liquid processing businesses, Texas Gas Transmission Corp. of
Owensboro, Ky., and CSX NGL Corp. of Houston, Texas.
   The company said also it might consider selling some of its
resort properties, including the Greenbrier hotel in West Virginia.
   The CSX announcement triggered positive investor reaction. Its
stock closed Monday at $30.62{ per share, up $3.75 on a volume of
almost 3.5 million shares in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Standard & Poor's Corp. responded to the announcement by placing
certain CSX securities on its CreditWatch with negative
implications, a possible prelude to lowering the company's credit
rating.
   S&P said even though CSX had cash and short-term investments of
$1.1 billion at mid-year, the company would need to borrow money to
finance its announced intention to trim 8,200 jobs from its
railroad payrolls.
   CSX's decision to unload the pipeline and possibly certain
resort properties marked a major move away from the diversification
strategy that CSX has embraced in recent years, said George T.
Williamson, director of reserch for Financial Corp. of Virginia.
   ``I think what it shows is almost a restlessness at the senior
management and board level with the price of their stock,'' he
said. ``They obviously consider it very much undervalued.''
   The pipeline and resorts should bring CSX more than $1 billion,
said Andrew Geller, a senior investment officer for Provident
National Bank in Philadelphia.
   When combined with the existing cash and short-term investments,
he said, the company will have more than $2 billion that can be
used to repurchase stock.
   CSX earlier this year agreed to sell its CSX Ol and Gas Corp.
subsidiary for $612 million to a major French energy concern, Total
Compagnie Francaise des Petroles.

   Kroger Co., the nation's largest grocery
chain, has reaffirmed its plans for a major restructuring after
receiving an unsolicited $4.32 billion takeover bid from the Haft
family of Maryland.
   Kroger received the $55-per-share bid for each of its 78.6
million outstanding shares on Monday by the Haft's Dart Group Inc.
The offer was revealed in a letter to Kroger's board by Dart
Chairman Herbert H. Haft.
   In his letter, which was made public by Kroger, Haft said Dart
was offering shareholders $43 cash per share and securities with a
trading value of about $12 per share.
   ``All terms, including price, are negotiable and we are
confident that together wer can determine and appropriate,
proportionate ownership of the combined companies by Dart Group's
shareholders and Kroger's shareholders,'' Haft said.
   The news of the offer pushed up Kroger's shares Monday. In
active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kroger rose $1.75 a
share to close at $52.75. Kroger, based in Cincinnati, operates
more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience stores and 15
membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also processes a
variety of food products for sale in its retail stores and to
outside customers.
   Dart, based in Landover, Md., owns the Crown Books bookstore
chain and the auto parts retailer Trak Auto Stores.
   Last week, Kroger said its board was considering a $3.8 billion
restructuring that would involve a special dividend of $40 a share
in addition to a junior subordinated debenture with a trading value
of about $8 per share.
   Kroger spokesman Paul Bernish said that while Dart's offer was
being reviewed, the company has not dropped its plans for the
restructuring, which is scheduled to be taken up by the board at
the end of September.
   The company declined further comment.
   The Kroger bid was the first takeover offer Dart has made since
its failed bid for Stop & Shop Cos. earlier this year. The Haft
family has expressed interest in F.W. Woolworth Co. and Zayre Corp.
this year, but has not bid for either retailer.
   Haft and his son Robert have earned reputations as corporate
raiders because they have bought up big stakes in retailers, made
unsuccessful takeover bids and then profited from the sale of their
stock when the companies bought back the shares or went private in
buyouts by other firms.
   Their targets in the past have included Supermarkets General
Corp., Safeway Stores Inc. _ both of which are supermarket
companies _ and Dayton Hudson Corp.
   The Hafts maintain they are interested in buying and operating a
retail company.
   In early August, the Hafts filed for federal approval to acquire
a substantial stake in Kroger.
   Analysts had mixed reactions to the latest Dart offer.
   Edwin Pincus, an analyst with Josephthal & Co. Inc. in New York,
said he doubts the sincerity of the buyout offer because it wasn't
made until after Kroger's restructuring proposal was announced.
   ``If they were serious, they would have done it before the
fact,'' Pincus said. ``They've done it after the fact.''

<HEAD>Japan's GNP Declines In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's economy contracted during the second
quarter due mainly to lower demand for exports and declining
investment in private housing, the government reported Tuesday.
   Overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national
product, declined at an annual rate of 3.9 percent during the April
to June period, the Economic Planning Agency said. On an adjusted
basis, the GNP fell by 1 percent, the agency said.
   During the first quarter, Japan's GNP grew 2.7 percent, or at an
annual rate of 11.3 percent, according to the government report.
   The decline in the total value of goods and services produced in
Japan during the period was the first quarter-on-quarter
contraction in the country's economy since the January to March
1986 period, when the economy briefly declined under the impact of
the sharply rising yen.
   The government's GNP growth rate target for the current fiscal
year is 3.8 percent.
   Agency officials said a 1.5 percent decline in foreign demand
for Japanese products and services and a downturn in private
housing investment over the previous quarter's levels more than
offset a modest growth in domestic personal consumption and private
capital investment.
   The greatest declines were in the yen value of exports of
televisions, video tape recorders, radios and motor vehicles, they
said. The Japanese yen has risen by about 83 percent against the
U.S. dollar in the past three years, making Japanese products more
expensive overseas.
   But despite the downturn from healthy GNP growth levels in
previous months, agency officials said Japan's economy remained
fundamentally strong.
   ``It's still showing a positive progression overall,'' said one
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``There's no reason to think that Japanese economic expansion
has ended,'' said Kenji Ito, senior economist for the Industrial
Bank of Japan. ``The fall in housing investments is a little
steeper than expected, but on the whole we thought the numbers
would be in this range.''
   The Economic Planning Agency had predicted earlier that the
second quarter's GNP would remain unchanged or decline slightly
from the previous quarter after statistics showed housing starts in
Japan were peaking.
   Housing construction had boomed because of low interest rates
and huge government expenditures in public works, which indirectly
stimulated construction and other industries.

   A federal appeals court ruling indefinitely
blocking the partial merger of Detroit's two daily newspapers is
the most encouraging sign yet for halting the deal, the main
opposition group said.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling Monday prevents the
Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News from proceeding with a
joint operating agreement until the court rules on the challenge
brought by Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press.
   The court also set an Oct. 28 hearing on the challenge to the
merger and agreed to expedite the case.
   John F. Kelly, the Michigan state senator who leads the
organization comprised of advertisers and readers opposed to the
merger, said he was extremely encouraged by the ruling.
   ``We jumped all the procedural hoops,'' Kelly said Monday. ``We
finally got to a forum that is willing to look at the merits of the
case.''
   To qualify for the indefinite halt of the merger, opponents had
to prove they have a ``substantial likelihood of success'' on the
merits of their claim.
   In granting the order, the court said opponents of the merger
``have presented a serious legal question.''
   Free Press publisher David Lawrence characterized the court
order as ``simply another development in a very long, now almost
30-month-old process.''
   ``What pleases me ... is the quite expedited schedule,'' he
said. ``That means everyone will get an earlier answer.''
   The Free Press, which has lost $100 million since 1980, is owned
by Knight-Ridder Inc. Gannett Co. bought the News in 1986, before
the dailies asked the Justice Department to approve the joint
operating agreement.
   Louis Weil, publisher of the News, referred questions about the
appellate court ruling to Sheila Gibbons, a spokeswoman for
Gannett, who could not be reached for comment.
   Frank Hawkins, a Knight-Ridder executive in Miami, was
unavailable for comment.
   Kelly's group disagrees with former Attorney General Edwin Meese
III, who ruled that the newspapers qualify for an antitrust
exemption under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970.
   They argue that the exemption, which would create the largest
joint operating agreement in the country, is unwarranted because
the two dailies are losing money only because they have engaged in
a 9-year-old price-cutting war to put each other out of business.
   Knight-Ridder and Gannett are the nation's two largest newspaper
publishing companies.
   The two papers have a combined weekday circulation of 1.2
million. The merger of the two dailies' advertising, circulation
and production departments would create one of the nation's largest
local newspaper publishing companies, and would result in the loss
of between 600 and 800 jobs.
   Knight-Ridder, which has threatened to close the Free Press if
the joint operating agreement is not approved, argues that the
newspaper is powerless to reverse losses by raising prices.

   The stock market strengthened slightly this
morning after a decline in the previous session, but the level of
trading remained light.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 3.91 points
to 2,084.99 as of 10 a.m. EDT.
   Among broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.27 to 152.19. The
American Stock Exchange's market-value index rose 0.34 to 298.01.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with
404 up, 445 down and 526 unchanged. Big Board volume totaled 19.96
million shares after the first 30 minutes of trading.
   Brokers said a downward revision in the Commerce Department's
estimate of second-quarter economic growth had little impact on
stock prices. They expected the level of trading to remain sluggish.
   ``I just feel that for the rest of the week, the market's going
to roll around in here,'' said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice
president and manager of institutional trading at Dillon Read & Co.
in New York. ``The only thing I like about it is the market seems
to be consolidating, not giving a lot of ground.''
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.07 to
2,081.08.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 557 up, 887 down and 483 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 135.77 million shares, against 211.11

   The Group of Seven finance ministers are generally
satisified with recent currency exchange rates and probably will
reaffirm their intent to cooperate on economic policy, Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said Tuesday.
   ``I think most of us are comfortable with the rates where they
are at this time,'' Lawson said at a news briefing ahead of the
International Monetary Fund's annual meeting and a G-7 meeting in
West Berlin this weekend.
   ``We are back in the Louvre rates and have been for some time,''
Lawson said.
   He was referring to a February 1987 meeting at the Louvre Palace
in France in which the G-7 agreed to keep the dollar steady.
   Lawson said he did not expect any new initiatives at the weekend
gathering of the finance ministers of the United States, Japan,
West Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy and Canada.
   However, he said he expected to see a ``full-hearted
reaffirmation of the cooperation we have been pursuing.''

<HEAD>OPEC President Said Price Committee May Not Call For Full Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC's price committee may not call for an
emergency meeting of the full cartel when it meets later this
month, the president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said Tuesday.
   Speaking at a press conference at the Asia-Pacific Petroleum
Conference here, Rilwanu Lukman also said OPEC's production may be
higher than recent estimates.
   Lukman said the five-member committee scheduled to meet Sept. 25
and 26 at an as yet undisclosed location, has a number of items on
its agenda besides the current oversupply of oil that has depressed
world prices.
   ``Present (oil market) conditions are serious, but whether they
warrent an emergency meeting is for the committee to decide,''
Lukman said. ``...It's by no means the only problem we have on
hand.''
   While the price committee cannot determine policy or set
production limits, it has the authority to call a meeting of the
full cartel, which can.
   World oil prices have declined in recent weeks on fears that
several OPEC countries were continuing to overproduce, adding to
the already excessive supply of oil. Last week, U.S. crude oil
prices dipped to near a two-year low then rebounded slightly on
reports that OPEC was reducing its output.
   However, Lukman estimated OPEC production is between 19 million
and 19.5 million barrels a day, higher than recent estimates of
between 18.5 million and 19 million barrels.
   The OPEC president cautioned it was difficult to assess current
cartel output.
   ``I think some people are very brave or very smart to make an
estimate,'' he said.
   On Monday, an industry newsletter said that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's
largest producer, was intentionally exceeding it production quota
to challenge other members to reduce their output.
   Lukman said OPEC cooperation with non-OPEC oil producers would
be another topic for discussion at next week's meeting, along with
the Iran-Iraq cease- fire. He said collaboration with non-OPEC
producers is ``perhaps the only way we can get better (crude oil)
prices.''
   ``The fact of the matter is there's some form of overproduction,
and it's not just OPEC alone,'' Lukman said.
   Lukman said OPEC is looking for specific cuts in non-OPEC
production ``as a guide to what (OPEC) will be able to do ourselves
to help in pushing prices up.''
   The cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq would help
OPEC planning, he said, but added that he doesn't expect Iraq to
return to its OPEC-assigned quota of 1.5 million barrels a day.
   Iraq is said to be producing approximately 2.7 million barrels
of oil a day and the country's oil minister said recently that it
may have to increase its output to gain the necessary revenue to
rebuild its war-torn economy.
   ``If they want to do 2.7 million, suppose Saudi Arabia says they
won't go below 10 million (barrels per day) as a counter to what
Iraq said?'' Lukman asked, quickly stressing his example was
hypothetical. Earlier, he denied he had information that Saudi
Arabia was overproducing.

<HEAD>Richland Agrees To Settlement In WPPSS Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   This city approved a tentative $6.5
million settlement in the massive Washington Public Power Supply
System lawsuit, leaving 18 defendants on trial over a record $2.25
billion bond default.
   ``I feel fantastic, very relieved,'' Councilman Lane Bray said
after the City Council approved the settlement Monday as the
federal trial continued in Tucson, Ariz.
   Plaintiffs in the case, including more than 24,000 bond buyers,
sued over WPPSS' 1983 bond default, which came after it abandoned
two nuclear power plants under construction. The default was the
biggest ever in the municipal bond market.
   Under the settlement, which is subject to approval by U.S.
District Judge William Browning, Richland will pay WPPSS
bondholders $6.5 million, of which $3.725 million will be paid by
Twin City Fire Insurance Co.
   The remaining $2.775 million comes from 1982 bonds Richland sold
to cover WPPSS plant termination costs and some capital
improvements, said City Manager Neal Shulman. The bond issue was
factored into past city electric rate hikes, Shulman said.
   The city also agreed to testify on bondholders' behalf.
   Richland, which has more than 30,000 residents, had a 1.965
percent interest in the scrapped nuclear plant projects.
   The settlement leaves 15 public utilities, two engineering firms
and a financial company as defendants in the trial, which was moved
to Tucson from Seattle because of pretrial publicity. Seven other
utilities settled with the plaintiffs before the trial began
earlier this month.
   Defendants argued in opening statements Monday that a 1983
Washington state Supreme Court ruling was to blame for the default.
The high court invalidated agreements that 88 utilities signed to
participate in building the nuclear plants financed by the bonds.
   ``The cause of the loss here is almost like an act of God, an
act of the Supreme Court of Washington,'' said Ralph Nickerson,
attorney for the Klickitat County Public Utility District.
   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by some utilities questioning
the agreements' validity. By nullifying them, the court removed the
guarantee that the bonds would be paid even if the plants were
never built.
   Although the ruling applied to them, none of the utilities was
part of that lawsuit.
   In opening arguments last week, bondholders' attorneys said the
defendants lied about power needs in the Northwest, rising costs
and construction delays. They contended that if the truth had been
told, the bond would not have gone on the market.
   Defense attorneys argued Monday that their clients revealed all
the information they were supposed to provide and did their best to
estimate costs and construction schedules.
   ``The evidence will show that these official statements were as
complete and accurate as people could make them, and they were not
filled with misstatements,'' said attorney James Hagan,
representing financial consultant Blyth Eastman Paine Webber Inc.
   Hagan and Nickerson said public utility commissioners and Blyth
employees were so confident in the information that they also
bought bonds.
   Testimony is scheduled to begin Thursday after a two-day recess.
   WPPSS was formed by public utilities to build and operate major
electric plants in Washington, Idaho and Oregon.

   Grain and soybean futures opened modestly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a technical rebound after
several days of falling prices, including Monday's sharp drop,
analysts said.
   ``We had a little technical bounce here but I don't know if it's
going to last,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   He noted a lack of sell orders at the opening bell and said the
buying was led by investment firms and commodity funds, the major

   Rumors of new export sales also supported the grain markets,
Lespinasse said.
   The Soviet Union supposedly was set to buy 1 million metric tons

<HEAD>Growing White Wheat In a Field of Red</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prospect of naturally sweeter bread and
new export markets is sparking fresh interest in the cultivation of
hard white winter wheat in the Plains states.
   While the hard red variety has been king of the Plains for more
than a century, a number of growers in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma,
Nebraska and Colorado are now giving white a try.
   The American White Wheat Producers Association, which sprang
from a group organized in Kansas, the nation's No. 1
wheat-producing state, says millers may pay premium prices for
white wheat because it yields more flour per bushel.
   White also has bread baking qualities comparable to hard red,
long the world's premium bread wheat.
   Because of its lighter kernel color _ amber rather than the red
_ more of the white wheat kernel can be ground and the flour is
lighter in color than that of red wheat, said Don Keesling,
president of the producers' group.
   The white wheat flour also has a slightly sweeter taste because
the kernels lack the tannins that give red wheat bran a bitter
taste, Keesling said. Thus, bakers can save money by cutting down
on sweetners normally used to offset the slight bitterness of red
wheat flour.
   ``My wife bakes with whole wheat flour from white wheat
sometimes and people think the things taste sweeter, even though
the sugar in the recipe actually is reduced,'' said Keesling, a
Chase, Kan., farmer.
   Hard red wheat has been the favorite among U.S. growers because
it had the advantage of catching on first, after Russian immigrants
introduced it to the Great Plains. As a result, little hard white
wheat is now grown in the United States. Some is raised in Montana
and California, and researchers in Idaho and Washington are
experimenting with hard white varieties.
   Most of the white wheat cultivated in the United States is of
the soft variety, grown primarily in the Pacific Northwest and used
in cookie and biscuit products.
   The movement to hard white is small but organized. The new
producers' group is incorporated as a marketing cooperative, which
controls the sale of the members' white wheat, said Howard Tice,
executive director of the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers.
   The white wheat will be treated as a specialty crop and
separated from hard red for marketing and storage. To avoid mixing
it with other varieties on the open market, the white wheat will be
sold on a contract basis by the cooperative.
   Keesling expects Kansas growers to plant more than 2,000 acres
of hard white wheat this fall, mostly in the western part of the
state, where growing conditions are best. Moister conditions in the
east have caused the hard white wheat to exhibit ``head sprouting''
_ in which the kernels in the heads of the plants begin to sprout,
destroying the value of the grain for milling purposes.
   Kansas State University wheat breeders are working on a new
variety with resistance to sprouting, but it is several years down
the road.
   One KSU variety being tested this year may be released in 1989,
said Joe Martin, a KSU wheat breeder stationed at the Fort Hays
Experiment Station.
   Kurt Feltner, KSU associate agriculture dean and director of
agriculture experiment stations, said increased grower interest has
given a dramatic boost to white wheat research begun in the late
1950s.
   ``Within the past 18 months or so the administration has given
us the green light to go ahead and increase our efforts because of
the extraction rate and possible marketing niches (for white
wheat)'' Feltner said.
   KTECH, Inc., a state economic development agency, gave the
university a $160,000 grant that was matched with $160,000 from the
Kansas Wheat Commission to work on white wheat and other wheat
projects. Feltner said grain scientists are studying white wheat
quality and end uses and agricultural economists are studying its
market potential.
   One of the areas being evaluated is white wheat's export
promise. Many of the world's importing countries prefer white
wheat, said KSU breeder Martin.
   ``Hopefully, this would open up some new avenues in some
traditionally Australian white wheat markets,'' Martin said.
   Australian white has been a favorite in the Soviet Union, the
Middle East and Southeast Asia. U.S. exporters would likely target
some of those strongholds.
   ``I think we're probably a couple of years away from knowing
whether white wheat is going to have an exciting start in Kansas or
whether it's going to be a gradual transition,'' said Feltner.

<HEAD>Greeting Card Designer Wants To Bridge Gap Between Blind And
Sighted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With something as simple as a greeting
card, Truesillia Ruth Shank hopes to help bridge the gap between
the separate worlds of the sighted and the blind.
   ``It seems so unfair that a blind person should miss out on the
simple, little pleasures of life,'' said Mrs. Shank, sitting in the
living room of her modest home that doubles as the office for her
7-month-old card company, Sucurre Greetings. Sucurre means ``to
assist'' in French.
   ``Can you imagine being 30, 40 or 50 years old and having to
wait for someone to read a stack of Christmas cards to you? Or not
being able to go into a store and pick out an anniversary card for
your wife or a birthday card for your child?'' she asked.
   The inspiration for Sucurre Greetings, which Mrs. Shank owns
with her husband, came while she was working on an advertising
project with a blind businessman.
   ``He was doing things I couldn't do even with my sight,'' she
said. ``It just didn't seem right that he needed someone to go to a
store with him just to pick out a card.''
   Because of the limited market, Braille greeting cards have not
been manufactured by established card companies, said Adam Ash,
publisher of the Gift Reporter, a trade publication for the gift
industry. Some rehabilitation agencies have been known to sell some
Braille cards at Christmas, and others translate greeting cards to
Braille when requested.
   ``At best, what you've been able to get up until now is a card
for a sighted person that's been Brailled. These cards are designed
specifically for a visually impaired person, but are still
appealing to a sighted person as well,'' said Paul Ponchillia, a
professor in the Department of Blind Rehabilitation at Western
Michigan University. Ponchillia, who is blind, helped the Shanks
design the cards.
   The Shanks, also co-owners of a year-old advertising and
printing company, hope the pastel colors and simple but elegant
designs embossed on the front of the cards will appeal to a wide
audience. Underneath the design is a description of the object in
Braille. Inside, Braille appears under the message, typically a
short phrase with slightly raised letters.
   One lavender card has an embossed bird in flight on the cover.
Inside, the message is ``My heart's all a-flutter.''
   In addition to her basic line of 25 cards, Mrs. Shank said she
also has a line of Christmas cards for the holidays.
   ``We want the person to get the full impact of the card _ a card
that everyone can enjoy,'' said Mrs. Shank, a bubbly, 32-year-old
mother of three.
   She does the embossing by hand. Her husband, Michael, art
director at an area television station, does much of the designing
and printing. Most of the Brailling is done by blind volunteers.
   Distribution of the cards is mostly limited to local card shops,
but Mrs. Shank says she fills mail orders and is trying to line up
distributors for the cards in other parts of the country. The cards
sell for $2 and $2.50 locally.
   If the cards catch on, the Shanks would like to provide jobs for
blind rehabilitation and training groups.
   And it looks like the cards may be catching on. Marshall Fields
has expressed interest in buying the line for their chain of
department stores, as well as an alphabet book Mrs. Shank designed
for use by both sighted and blind children.
   ``Before getting involved in this, I never really knew a blind
person and I don't think I ever remember seeing a book that's shown
me what Braille's like,'' she said. ``We planned the book to get
rid of the gap between sighted and blind children. We want a
sighted child to know what Braille feels like and a blind child to
be able to feel the letters that we're seeing. Maybe that way we
can get rid of some of the prejudice.''
   Prejudice is a subject Mrs. Shank knows well.
   ``Because I'm black, some people might ask why I'm not doing
something for a black cause. Well, blindness knows no color. When
people stop being prejudiced against blind people or handicapped
people, maybe they'll stop being prejudiced about black people,''
she said.

   Leave it to show business veteran Thomas
Scallen to team the forces of Olympic silver medal figure skater
Elizabeth Manley and the Harlem Globetrotters.
   Canada's superstar on ice won't suit up with the magicians of
basketball, but she is performing under the same flag: Scallen's
International Broadcasting Corp.
   Scallen's company purchased the Hollywood, Calif.-based
Globetrotters and Ice Capades for $30 million in December 1986 from
Metromedia Inc. Signing Manley to the Ice Capade's fall tour is one
of many moves the former public defender, banker and motion picture
executive has made to revitalize the skating troupe.
   He also has added a second squad to the Globetrotters and hired
female players Sandra Hodge, Nancy Lieberman and Joyce Walker to
draw more women to the games.
   What's more, Scallen recently acquired the Boblo Island
amusement park near Detroit for $19.5 million. He says the 272-acre
island in the lower Detroit River will generate cash flow during
the summer months when the Globetrotters and Ice Capades are idle.
   ``What we are is a mini-Walt Disney,'' said the 62-year-old
Scallen. ``We want to expand within the concept of quality family
entertainment.''
   Besides the Ice Capades, Globetrotters and Boblo Island,
Scallen's company owns a controlling interest in Century Park
Pictures, a Hollywood production company that made the movie
``Shoot to Kill,'' starring Sidney Poitier and Tom Berenger. A
second film, ``South of Picasso,'' is in the works and will feature
Tom Hanks.
   Scallen also has his eyes on more regional amusement parks and
some television stations. It was Scallen's sale of Big Country TV
of Abilene, Texas, for an after-tax profit of $4.9 million that
allowed him to purchase the Ice Capades and Globetrotters.
   ``Let's say John Kluge (chairman of Metromedia Inc.) and Walt
Disney are my role models,'' Scallen said.
   So far, Scallen has transformed International Broadcasting from
an obscure penny stock company, which lost $1.2 million on sales of
$2 million in 1986, to a $34 million company that expects to post
net earnings this year of more than $2 million. International
Broadcasting stock now trades in the range of $10 a share on the
national over-the-counter market.
   The business seems to fit Scallen's colorful past.
   There was the law degree from the University of Denver that
allowed him to work in that city as a public defender before
returning to his hometown of Minneapolis, where he acquired his
love of skating. He said he returned to Minnesota to join a law
firm in which his father was a partner.
   From there he turned to a banking career, starting the Bank of
Minneapolis and helping to finance Joe Robbie's purchase of the
Miami Dolphins professional football team. But he quit that to
launch his show business career that eventually had him running
Shipsteads & Johnson Ice Follies, Holiday on Ice, and the Clyde
Beatty-Cole Bros. Circus. He also worked briefly in a top executive
post at 20th Century Fox.
   His darting moves through the entertainment world were briefly
derailed in the early 1980s when Scallen ran afoul of Canadian
securities laws. He was convicted _ but later pardoned _ for
distributing a false prospectus on a loan he arranged to help
finance his acquisition of the Vancouver Canucks hockey team.
   In typical style, Scallen emerged from the episode relatively
unscathed. He was paroled after serving nine months of a two-year
prison sentence and was pardoned in 1982 by the solicitor general
of Canada. Later, he even sold the Canucks for a profit, he says.
   ``There's no way of telling how painful an experience like that
(prison term) was,'' Scallen said after receiving the pardon.
``Particularly when I believed then as I do now that I didn't do
anything wrong.''
   As IBC has grown from two employees in 1982 to 2,000 employees
this year, the demands on Scallen have increased. But he says he
loves it and he has refused to dilute his control over the company.
   ``This company is my life and it's a delight,'' Scallen said
from his top-floor office in Minneapolis' signature skyscraper, the
IDS Center.
   Splitting time between Minneapolis and an office in Hollywood,
Scallen operates the company with a skeletal administration that
includes no middle managers. He says he won't make an acquisition
``unless it's a business I can run myself,'' and he still spends
time at the ice rink staging Ice Capades shows.
   ``That's how I get my kicks,'' Scallen said. ``Those shows are
the last big spectaculars in this country.''
   Carolyn Follese, who follows International Broadcasting for
Summit Investment Co. of Bloomington, Minn., said her only concern
about the company is that Scallen tries to do everything.
   ``When I started with this stock it was a dime,'' Follese said.
``I just thought Scallen was going to do it and sure enough he did.
He's performed some real nice miracles lately.''

   The stock market posted a tiny gain today, but
the pace of trading was sluggish.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 17.07
points on Monday, was up 1.78 points to 2,082.86 as of noontime.
   Advancing issues held a slim lead over declines on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 633 up, 610 down and 529 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 70.58 million shares at noon on Wall
Street, compared with 69.80 million shares at the same point on
Monday.
   ``It's been pretty dull,'' said Charles Jensen, a technical
market analyst for the investment firm MKI Securities Corp.
   ``People are waiting for something more conclusive to stir them
off the sidelines,'' he said.
   The government's downward revision of its estimate of
second-quarter economic growth failed to provide any stimulus to
traders.
   Jensen noted that the report had virtually no impact on bond
prices, which often rally on indications of moderating economic
growth.
   At midday, Treasury notes and bond prices were trading close to
Monday's late levels.
   With bond yields still relatively attractive, Jensen said many
traders have found incentive to take the risks associated with the
uncertain returns on stocks.
   Among the blue chip issues, American Telephone & Telegraph was
up [ at 26], Exxon was unchanged at 45 and American Express fell {
to 28{.
   Kroger led the NYSE list of most most actively-traded issues,
slipping \ to 52{. The company said on Monday that the Haft family
had proposed at a takeover at $55 a share.
   Schlumberger rose 1} to 34. The oil-service company announced
late Monday that would repurchase 30 million shares of common stock.
   Time was down 8{ to 107}. The company said after the close of
trading on Monday that it isn't considering a leveraged buyout or
any other transaction. The company issued the statement after its
stock price had risen $19 a share over the past two sessions.
   Among the broader market indicators, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all listed issues rose 0.07 to 151.99. The
American Stock Exchange's market-value index rose 0.36 to 298.03.

<HEAD>Terrorizing the American Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the most popular games played today is
terrorizing the American household. It's great fun, and profitable,
too.
   Among those at the forefront of the movement are the media, the
government, the business community, the fraternity of seers in such
fields as economics, finance and science, and the outright
exploiters. Fear sells, you know.
   You can sell fear to anyone concerned about physical or economic
well being, and if you don't think so just take a look at the
magazine rack or the book stall. The field is wide open; if fear
doesn't exist, you can create it.
   Some of the fears are legitimate perhaps, but since there is no
end to them, it becomes impossible to sort them out. How can you
worry about radon, the well water, the air you breath and the
weather together?
   Are you sure your children aren't overdosing on vitamins? Are
they consuming too many fats, too much salt? What's your
cholesterol level? When did you last check your blood pressure? You
say you haven't had a physical?
   You were warned about the hurricane danger and still you haven't
taken precautions? Don't you know the season continues into
October? Tornados, you know, can occur at any time of year. Are you
the kind of person who hasn't yet begun preparing for the
greenhouse effect?
   You say that the latter hasn't even been demonstrated? That's
pride and arrogance talking, especially if you live on the
seacoast. Just what will you do if the ice caps melt, raises the
ocean level and swallows up your city?
   More to the moment, winter is coming. Are you sure your pipes
are insulated? Had your flu shots? Remember that little leak in the
roof last winter? It could become a big one in January.
   How are your finances? Do you mean to say that in these perilous
times, when nobody knows what awful thing will happen next, you
have no financial plan? No will? When was the last time you checked
your health insurance?
   Are you prepared for the coming recession? Have you made plans
to benefit from the coming boom if that comes before the coming
recession? And what if deflation comes instead? You have to be
ready for that possibility, too.
   Your economic preparedness kit should include procedures for
handling the coming real estate collapse, the stock market
collapse, the bank collapse. Have you really considered the dangers
of that variable rate mortgage of yours?
   No matter what the politicians say, incidentally, you should
worry about higher taxes. But you should worry, too, if they aren't
raised, because then the federal budget will remain in deficit, and
that is bad.
   Hold on, says economist Howard Ruff. He says you should add the
shrinking federal defict to your fear list.
   ``It is to be feared in the same way that a junkie fears the
cutoff of his supply,'' he warns. ``The withdrawal symptoms could
be severe. A deficit stimulates an economy. When it shrinks, the
junkies get sick.''
   Ruff's fear list includes deflation, higher interest rates,
Dukakis' election, inflation-hedge investments, the stock market
and the collapse of the American family, ``my greatest concern.''
   There are so many things to fear that, for diversion, some
securities seers have strung together lists of things not to fear,
such as missing out on a bull market in stocks or failing to
prepare for a strong economy.
   Having exploited fear a decade ago with the book ``The Coming
Real Estate Crash,'' which either didn't occur or somehow wasn't
observed by millions of Americans, the same author has now written
``Panic-Proof Investing.''
   ``A fearsome situation is developing,'' said a worrier the other
day. ``What are we ever going to do about all these used and unused
fears that are piling up and polluting the environment?''
   He said it was really something to worry about.

<TEXT>
   Stock prices finished higher in calm trading
Tuesday, supported by news of slower-than-expected growth in
British bank lending during August.
   Although prices on Wall Street were retreating by the close of
the London session, British equities stood their ground and barely
budged from their session peaks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 12.2
points, or 0.7 percent, higher at 1,772.1, just below its best
level for the day of 1,772.8.
   Volume remained light, with 309.2 million shares changing hands,
compared with 326.7 million shares traded Monday.
   The British bank lending figures helped ease concern that
Britain's interest rates might have to move higher over the short
term in response to nagging inflationary pressures.
   The report showed that the most widely watched indication of
domestic bank lending rose 5.8 billion pounds, the equivalent of
$9.7 billion, in August, less than July's 9.2 billion-pound rise,
and less than the 7 billion-pound to 10 billion-pound rise expected
by the market.

<HEAD>Estimate of 2nd Quarter Growth Scaled Back, but Still Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy, fueled by an export-driven
manufacturing boom but held back by losses from the drought,
expanded at a strong 3.0 percent in the April-June quarter, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, grew to a seasonally adjusted
annual level of $3.99 trillion in the second quarter, a $29.1
billion increase from the January-March quarter.
   It was an unexpected downward revision from a preliminary
estimate a month ago of 3.3 percent growth last quarter. The
economy had grown at a 3.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter.
   If not for the drought, second quarter growth would have been a
more robust 3.9 percent. Crop losses for the year are estimated at
$13.9 billion and will be even more of a drag on the economy in the
third and fourth quarters.
   The government attributed the downward revision in the second
quarter to slightly less growth than first thought in the two
strongest sectors in the economy: export sales and investment
spending by business.
   Exports of goods and services expanded at a 9.1 percent annual
rate, compared with the previous estimate of 11.6 percent.
   Business investment spending shot up 15.0 percent, compared with
last month's estimate of 16.3 percent.
   However, consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of
all economic activity, was up 3.0 percent at an annual rate,
compared with a slightly weaker 2.7 percent previously announced.
   The linchpins of growth during the first half of this year have
been a boom in manufacturing triggered by the export surge and the
consequent spending spree by manufacturers to modernize and expand
their factories.
   But the strong growth has been accompanied by faster inflation.
The government said a price measure tied to the GNP rose at the
fastest rate in nearly six years.
   The GNP deflator, which reflects changes in buying patterns as
well as prices, rose at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the second
quarter, compared with 1.7 percent in the first quarter. It was the
biggest jump since the third quarter of 1982.
   Nevertheless, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``The facts, plus the moderating growth rate, point to inflation
remaining under control.'' He said the report was ``good news.''
   In another report, the Commerce Department said that after-tax
profits by corporations surged 8.9 percent in the second quarter to
an annual rate of $162.7 billion, up from a 2.5 percent annual rate
in the first quarter. It was the most profitable quarter since the
July-September period of 1983.
   The Federal Reserve Board, concerned about statistics showing a
tightening labor market and factories straining toward the limits
of their capacity, began an inflation-fighting program in late
March by pushing up short-term interest rates.
   As reports on third quarter economic activity emerge, some
economists are seeing signs of the desired slowdown. Among them:
   _Civilian unemployment, at a 14-year low in June of 5.3 percent,
rose in July and again in August, to 5.6 percent. More people
looking for work means less upward pressure on wages.
   _Retail sales, a good barometer of consumer demand, fell 0.2
percent in August after a lackluster 0.1 percent rise in July.
   _Industrial operating rates edged up another notch in August,
from 83.6 percent to 83.7 percent, but the increase was caused by a
temporary surge at utilities. Rates in the closely watched
manufacturing sector edged down, from 83.9 percent ot 83.8 percent.
   For all of 1988, the Reagan administration is predicting real
growth of 3.5 percent, which, if realized, would be the strongest
since 1984.
   However, some economists such as Michael K. Evans, a private
forecaster in Washington, see the annual growth rate easing to less
than 3 percent in the quarter ending this month.
   Evans said growth rates in both exports and investment spending
will be unable to maintain their recent torrid pace. Meanwhile, he
says consumer spending will be hit sooner by Fed's tightening of
the money supply than in the past because more people have
adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans tied to interest rate
fluctuations.
   ``Rates have not gone up that much, but consumers are being
cautious. They're just not taking on the debt to pay for those
big-ticket items,'' he said.
   Evans predicted that overall economic growth will wind down
enough to allow the Fed to lower interest rates near the end of the
year.
   But other analysts say the economy at the end of the second
quarter had too much momentum for any appreciable slowdown to occur
during the current quarter.
   James Annable, chief economist of First National Bank of
Chicago, predicted third quarter growth of more than 3.5 percent,
the fastest of the year.
   The sluggishness in the consumer sector, he said, is only part
of an economy in transition from consumer-led growth to trade-led
expansion.
   ``And we've got at least another year and probably two years of
trade improvement coming,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, the slow numbers released so far for August will
give Fed policy makers the excuse they want to take a break from
pushing interest rates higher between now and the Nov. 8 election,
he said.
   ``The Fed loves it. ... They're going to stand pat. ... They can
not involve themselves in the election and that's exactly what they
want to do. But after the election, if I'm right, that means
interest rates will start to go up again,'' he said.

   Witnesses reported a 60th person was shot and killed as soldiers
halted looting at a market in the city. One witness reported an
exchange of gunfire in downtown Rangoon on Tuesday evening, but
details could not be confirmed because of the 8 p.m. to 4 a.m.
curfew imposed by Saw Maung.
   Sporadic clashes were reported in Mandalay in central Burma but
no details were available. Telephone communications were out after
the Communications Department's microwave dish was damaged by a
rocket in the morning.
   One opposition leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
street protests had been called off to avoid further bloodshed.
   Three key opposition leaders issued a statement Tuesday
condemning the military crackdown, saying: ``Such suppression by
force of arms will not stop the people's just demand for
democracy.''
   The statement was issued by former Brig. Gen. Aung Gyi, former
Defense Minister Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of Burma's
late independence leader. They demanded talks with Saw Maung ``to
seek ways to correctly solve the current crisis.''
   The statement also rebuffed offers from the country's myriad
ethnic insurgents to support the pro-democracy uprising and told
authorities to stop spreading rumors that the rebels had
infiltrated the mass demonstrations, which have included millions
of Buddhist monks, students and striking civil servants.
   The top Buddhist monks' group also issued a statement Tuesday
seeking a dialogue between demonstrators and the new government.
   State-run radio announced that a deadline for striking workers
to return to their jobs was extended from Sept. 26 to Oct. 3. Most
government employees walked off their jobs Aug. 8 following a call
for a nationwide general strike.
   That strike and bloody protests earlier forced a quick end to
Sein Lwin's presidency, which lasted only 16 days until Aug. 12. He
had replaced Ne Win, the strongman who came to power in a 1962
coup. Ne Win quit after mounting unrest over the country's
moribound economy and one-party rule.
   Some observers believe Ne Win still controls the leadership from
behind the scenes.

<HEAD>Securities Exec: Reasons To Support Farmer Mac Despite Unknowns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unless the financial industry takes a
real interest in a new form of farm lending, the opportunity may
not arise again, an investment firm executive told a forum of
Midwestern bankers Tuesday.
   Jeff Rodman said the newly created Federal Agricultural Mortgage
Corp., known as Farmer Mac, could help banks keep rural customers
and reduce the risk of writing farm loans. Farmers, meantime, are
hoping the agency will spur competition for farm loans and hold
down interest rates.
   Rodman said that despite high hopes for Farmer Mac, there are
many unanswered questions about the agency designed to establish a
secondary market for farm loans. One big unknown is how much of a
demand exists for such new markets.
   If Farmer Mac does not sell well, ``I'm afraid it's an
opportunity we may not get again,'' he told a seminar at the Iowa
Bankers Association convention.
   Farmer Mac was established by Congress to enable rural lenders
such as banks, insurance companies and the Farm Credit System to
combine loans and use those pools of mortgages as security for
investments sold to the public. It is still in the process of being
organized and is months away from adopting even such basic
regulations as how its loan pools will be organized.
   Rodman is vice president for marketing for MABSCO Capital Inc.,
a Des Moines-based company designed to provide banks access to
secondary markets. MABSCO is owned by the insurance company Mutual
of New York and state banking associations in Iowa and 11 other
states. Rodman said his company is interested in becoming one of
the organizations pooling farm loans and selling mortgage-backed
securities to investors.
   About $8 billion in new farm mortgage credit is extended every
year, and only part of that will qualify for Farmer Mac securities,
according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo. That will
make Farmer Mac a small country cousin to such providers of
secondary residential mortgages as Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac and
Fannie Mae.
   The outstanding principal balances of residential mortgages
backing securities guaranteed by those three established agencies,
formally known as the Government National Mortgage Association,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage
Association, totaled more than $670 billion at the end of last
year, according to the Kansas City Fed.
   What's more, farm loan demand has been in the doldrums in recent
months.
   Following the farm crisis of the first half of the 1980s, in
which farm debt rose to record levels, bringing down many banks,
survivors began staging a recovery assisted by huge government
subsidies. As a result, many surviving agricultural and rural banks
are flush with cash.
   But Rodman said credit could begin getting tight as early as
1989 making Farmer Mac a welcome tool for assuring liquidity and
enabling lenders to shift the risk of long-term loans to investors.
   This summer's drought reduced crop yields, thinned livestock
herds and held down many farmers' income at a time when the
government is beginning to move to reduce its subsidies, and
analysts are predicting loan demand from farmers will be growing as
they expand plantings next spring. Not only are farmers expected to
plant more next year, but the price of seed and fertilizer is
rising and interest rates have been headed higher.
   ``If loan funds get tight, we can see demand develop quickly''
to harness Farmer Mac, Rodman said.
   Analysts say yields on Farmer Mac securities should be
competitive with Fannie Mae and other secondary markets for
mortgages. The securities will be backed with a $1.5 billion line
of credit at the U.S. Treasury that can be tapped if losses in any
mortgage pool exceed a 10 percent reserve fund established by
lenders and pool operators.

<TEXT>
   The dollar drifted lower against most major
foreign currencies in light European trading Tuesday, reflecting
more reluctance by dealers to do business ahead of top-level
finance minister meetings this week.
   Gold prices rose slightly in quiet trading.
   Markets ignored a downward revision in U.S. gross national
product figures for the second quarter to 3.0 percent from 3.3
percent, foreign currency dealers said. They were more concerned
with the potential impact of meetings starting Thursday by the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
   The IMF-World Bank discussions on international debt will be
followed by a Saturday gathering of finance ministers from the
leading industrialized democracies. Both meetings will be held in
West Berlin.
   Ministers from the so-called Group of Seven countries _ the
United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy
and Canada _ are expected to push for stable currency exchange
rates, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar edged up 0.35 Japanese yen to a closing 134.15 yen.
Later in London it retreated to 133.90 yen.
   Many dealers said the worsening health of Emperor Hirohito and a
second-quarter decline of 1.0 percent in Japan's gross national
product pushed the yen down.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6865 to buy one pound, more expensive than its $1.6785 level
late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday:
1.8641 West German marks, down from 1.8695; 1.5740 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5793; 6.3385 French francs, down from 6.3520; 2.1075
Dutch guilders, down from 2.1100; 1,391.50 Italian lire, down from
1,393.50; 1.2203 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2194.
   Higher gold prices reflected internal market influences rather
than renewed interest in the metal, said one Zurich bullion dealer.
   In London, gold edged up to $410 a troy ounce from late Monday's
$409.30.
   In Zurich, gold closed at $410.50, up from $408.50 late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold rose $1.72 to close at $413.12.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to $6.36 a troy ounce, from
Monday's $6.28.

moderate growth was an increase in a measure of inflation tied to

<HEAD>Pillsbury First-Quarter Income Up 26 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. reported Tuesday its
first-quarter earnings rose 26 percent, in part because of a change
in accounting for income taxes.
   Pillsbury said it earned $71.4 million, or 83 cents per share,
during the quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with $56.8 million, or
66 cents per share, in the same period a year ago.
   The company noted in a statement that its income was boosted $14
million as a result of the recalculation of prior years' deferred
income taxes.
   Sales rose 2 percent to $1.48 billion from $1.46 billion.
   ``This represents the first step toward a better year in fiscal
1989, a year in which we expect to gain momentum toward much better
long-term prospects,'' said Philip L. Smith, Pillsbury's chairman,
president and chief executive officer.
   Pillsbury's food business has shown improvement, but the company
is still spending heavily to boost its slumping restaurants
division, Smith said.
   The restaurants unit reported a 34 percent decline in operating
profit to $48.7 million from $73.5 million as sales declined 7
percent to $655 million. The unit includes Burger King, Steak and
Ale and Godfather's Pizza.
   On Monday, Pillsbury announced it was selling Godfather's to the
chain's management for an undisclosed amount.

<HEAD>Grains Close Higher On Trade Rumors; Soybeans Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and corn futures closed higher Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors of new U.S. grain sales to
the Soviet Union but soybeans finished narrowly mixed on a lack of
strong bullish signals.
   ``It was a day pretty much ruled by rumors,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Talk that the Soviets had purchased 1 million to 2 million
metric tons of both corn and wheat prompted buying in those
markets, he said.
   Rumors that government officials had scheduled an afternoon news
conference regarding the ongoing grain-trade negotiations with the
Soviet Union added further fuel to the rally. But officials later
denied a news conference was planned.
   A rumor that the Soviets had purchased 500,000 metric tons of
Argentine soybean meal lent only marginal support to the soybean
market. Such a purchase would indicate new demand for soybeans but
players in the U.S. soybean market are looking for more demand for
the homegrown product to develop.
   At the close, wheat was 3{ cents to 8\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.04 a bushel; corn was 2{
cents lower to 2} cents higher with September at $2.73{ a bushel;

<HEAD>IBM Offers One-Stop Service For Others' Equipment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. said
Tuesday it would offer one-stop service for equipment made by other
companies, but analysts said most customers would rather deal
directly with their suppliers than go through IBM.
   IBM's offer was part of its biggest announcement since June 1987
in the field of computer networking products and services, Ellen
Hancock, the general manager of communications systems, said in an
interview.
   Among other things, IBM announced easier ways for its computers
to connect to equipment made by other companies using international
communications standards, and better methods for customers to
manage their networks by remote control.
   Several analysts said they had doubts about how customers would
respond to IBM's offer to serve as the single point of contact for
customers when they had problems with any of their equipment,
whether made by IBM or another company.
   Digital Equipment Corp. launched a similar service last week, a
signal that both companies see the possibility of a lucrative
business in managing and servicing computer networks.
   If customers have a problem with equipment made by, say, Wang
Laboratories Inc., they would rather deal directly with Wang than
go through IBM, which is a competitor of Wang, said Stephen Payne,
chief executive of PA Consulting in Hightstown, N.J.
   Payne said he also doubted how many customers would opt for
another service in which IBM would install probes in a company's
network and then monitor it for trouble from an IBM location.
   ``You could think of lots and lots of reasons why this might not
fly,'' said Bart Stuck, a vice president at Probe Research Inc. in
Cedar Knolls, N.J.
   Ms. Hancock agreed that the services were not for everyone, but
said some customers would prefer to have someone else handle their
network management and service.

   The stock market posted a modest gain today,
recovering some of the ground lost in the previous session.
   The pace of trading was sluggish.
   Analysts said the gain represented a technical rebound from

   Charles Jensen, a technical market analyst for the investment

<HEAD>Prospect of Bidding War as Kohlberg Kravis Bids for Kroger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prospect of a bidding war over Kroger Co.
loomed Tuesday as the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
offered $4.6 billion for the supermarket operator, topping an offer
from Dart Group Corp. made the day before.
   Kohlberg Kravis _ which earlier this year outbid Dart for Stop &
Shop Cos. _offered to pay $58.50 per share for each of Kroger's
78.6 million outstanding shares, or a total of $4.6 billion.
   The New York-based Kohlberg Kravis said in a letter to Kroger it
proposed to buy the retailer for a combination of cash, debt and
equity in the company that would formed after a buyout.
   On Monday, the Haft family that controls Dart offered $55 per
share, or a total of $4.32 billion, to buy Kroger. A Dart
spokesman, Stanley Rubenstein, said the Landover, Md.-based company
had no comment on the competing Kohlberg Kravis offer.
   Kroger stock soared after the Kohlberg Kravis announcement,
closing at $56.25 a share, up $3.50 from Monday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Kroger reacted to the latest offer as it did to the Dart bid,
saying it was reviewing the proposal but would continue to explore
the possibility of a restructuring.
   Last week, Kroger said it was considering a $3.8 billion
restructuring that could make the company less attractive for a
buyout. The Cincinnati-based retailer's board of directors was to
review the proposal by the end of this month, the company said.
   In its letter Tuesday, Kohlberg Kravis noted the restructuring
proposal and the Dart offer, and said its own bid ``will better
serve the interests of the company and its shareholders.''
   The investment firm said it would pay $50 in cash, plus $8.50 in
securities for each Kroger share.
   Dart Chairman Herbert Haft also told Kroger in a letter made
public Monday his company was offering shareholders a better deal
than the restructuring plan. Haft offered $43 cash per share and
securities with a trading value of about $12 per share.
   Kroger said its restructuring would involve a special dividend
of $40 a share in addition to a junior subordinated debenture with
a trading value of about $8 per share. The company has declined
further comment on what the restructuring would involve.
   Analyst Elizabeth M. Shiels of the investment firm Hilliard
Lyons Inc., Louisville, Ky., said Tuesday the added pressure on
Kroger made it likely the company would sell off some of its assets
_ either as part of the proposed restructuring or under new
ownership.
   Kroger would most likely keep its core supermarket business but
would consider selling its food production or convenience store
operations, she said.
   ``I think no matter who acquires the company, those are likely
candidates,'' said Ms. Shiels.
   ``It'll become a smaller company, it'll become a leaner
company,'' she said.
   Kroger operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience
stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. It also processes
a variety of food products for sale in its retail stores and to
outside customers.
   Dart owns the Crown Books bookstore chain and the auto parts
retailer Trak Auto Stores.
   The Kroger bid was the first takeover offer Dart has made since
it lost a battle for Stop & Shop to Kohlberg Kravis in February.
Dart made a hostile $1.03 billion offer for Stop & Shop, but the
Hafts' target agreed to a $1.2 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg
Kravis.
   Herbert Haft and his son Robert have earned reputations as
corporate raiders because they have bought up big stakes in
retailers, made unsuccessful takeover bids and then profited from
the sale of their stock when the companies bought back the shares
or went private in buyouts by other companies.
   Their targets in the past have included Supermarkets General
Corp., Safeway Stores Inc. _ both supermarket companies _ and the
Dayton Hudson Corp. retailer.
   The Hafts maintain they are interested in buying and operating a
retail company.

   A former programmer has been convicted
of planting a computer ``virus'' in his employer's system that
wiped out 168,000 records and was activated like a time bomb, doing
its damage two days after he was fired.
   Tarrant County Assistant District Attorney Davis McCown said he
believes he is the first prosecutor in the country to have someone
convicted for destroying computer records using a ``virus.''
   ``We've had people stealing through computers, but not this type
of case,'' McCown said. ``The basis for this offense is deletion.''
   ``It's very rare that the people who spread the viruses are
caught,'' said John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry
Association in Santa Clara, Calif., which helps educate the public
about viruses and find ways to fight them.
   ``This is absolutely the first time'' for a conviction, McAfee
said.
   ``In the past, prosecutors have stayed away from this kind of
case because they're too hard to prove,'' McCown said Tuesday.
``They have also been reluctant because the victim doesn't want to
let anyone know there has been a breach of security.''
   Donald Gene Burleson, 40, was convicted Monday of charges of
harmful access to a computer, a third-degree felony that carries up
to 10 years in prison and up to $5,000 in fines.
   A key to the case was the fact that State District Judge John
Bradshaw allowed the computer program that deleted the files to be
introduced as evidence, McCown said. It would have been difficult
to get a conviction otherwise, he said.
   The District Court jury deliberated six hours before bringing
back the first conviction under the state's 3-year-old computer
sabotage law.
   Burleson planted the virus in revenge for his firing from an
insurance company, McCown said.
   Jurors were told during a technical and sometimes-complicated
three-week trial that Burleson planted a rogue program in the
computer system used to store records at USPA and IRA Co., a Fort
Worth-based insurance and brokerage firm.
   A virus is a computer program, often hidden in apparently normal
computer software, that instructs the computer to change or destroy
information at a given time or after a certain sequence of commands.
   The virus, McCown said, was activated Sept. 21, 1985, two days
after Burleson was fired as a computer programmer, because of
alleged personality conflicts with other employees.
   ``There were a series of programs built into the system as early
as Labor Day (1985),'' McCown said. ``Once he got fired, those
programs went off.''
   The virus was discovered two days later, after it had eliminated
168,000 payroll records, holding up company paychecks for more than
a month. The virus could have caused hundreds of thousands of
dollars in damage to the system had it continued, McCown said.
   The defense argued during trial that Burleson was set up by
someone using his terminal and code. Burleson's attorneys tried to
prove he was vacationing in another part of the state with his son
on the dates in early September when the rogue programs were
entered into the system.
   But prosecutors presented records showing that Burleson was at
work and his son at school on those dates.
   Defense lawyer Jack Beech maintained Burleson is innocent and
but said his client might not have enough money to appeal.
   Besides, Beech said, Burleson is likely to get the minimum
sentence of two years' probation.
   McCown said he is hoping for a stiffer sentence.
   Bradshaw on Tuesday ordered a presentence investigation and set
sentencing Oct. 21.
   Burleson already has lost a civil case waged against him by USPA
in connection with the incident. The jury in that case ordered him
to pay $12,000 to his former employers.
   McAfee said his organization had documented about 250,000 cases
of sabotage by computer virus.

<HEAD>Dollar Little Changed; Gold Falls Toward $400</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar barely moved Tuesday in light
foreign-exchange dealings, which money brokers attributed to
upcoming meetings of senior finance ministers that might affect the
U.S. currency's value.
   Gold prices rose abroad but retreated in New York, falling
toward the $400- a-troy-ounce level in active trading. Republic
National Bank quoted bullion at $404.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EDT, down from $409.20 late Monday.
   Foreign-exchange strategists said a meeting Thursday in West
Berlin by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, followed
Saturday by top-level finance officials from the leading industrial
democracies, were deterring much dollar trading. The currency moved
marginally throughout the day.
   ``We're into that range for the dollar again,'' said Stuart
Yannalfo, a senior foreign-exchange trader at Refco Inc., a New
York-based commodities futures company. ``Unfortunately, we need
something to rattle it.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar edged up 0.35 Japanese yen to 134.15 yen.
Later in London it edged down to 133.90 yen. By the time trading
ended in New York the dollar fetched 134.09 yen, up slightly from
133.54 yen late Monday.
   The British pound strengthened mildly against the dollar in
London to $1.6865, up from $1.6785 late Monday. In New York
sterling fetched $1.6817, more expensive than $1.6787 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with levels late
Monday, included: 1.8669 West German marks, down from 1.8677;
1.5767 Swiss francs, down from 1.5780; 1.2183 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.2188; 6.3450 French francs, down from 6.3495; 1,389.00
Italian lire, down from 1,391.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.8641 West German marks, down from 1.8695; 1.5740 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5793; 6.3385 French francs, down from 6.3520;
2.1075 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1100; 1,391.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,393.50; 1.2203 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2194.
   Trading was much more active in the precious metals market,
where gold prices continued to slide in U.S. dealings to the lowest
levels since early last year, a reaction to growing investor
disillusionment with bullion's value as a long-term investment and
protection against inflation.
   ``We're going to test $400. It's not even a question anymore,''
said Alan Posnick, senior vice president at MTB Banking Corp., a
New York-based gold trading company. ``We've really been stuck in a
rut for a long time and there's a lot of disinterest.''
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fell $3.90 a troy ounce to $405.30.
   Earlier in London, gold rose 70 cents to $410; in Zurich,
Switzerland, it rose $2 to $410.50; and in Hong Kong it rose $1.72
to $413.12.
   Silver for current delivery tumbled 11.8 cents a troy ounce on
the New York Comex to $6.252. Earlier in London silver rose 12
cents to $6.36.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market posted a modest gain in
lethargic trading on Tuesday, recovering some of the ground lost in
the previous session.
   ``It's been pretty dull,'' said Charles Jensen, a technical
market analyst for the investment firm MKI Securities Corp.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 17.07
points on Monday, bounced up 6.40 points to close at 2,087.48.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
862 issues up, 603 down and 500 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 142.22 million shares,
up from 135.77 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
167.39 million shares.
   The Dow Jones industrials opened slightly higher, traded in a
narrow range for most of the day and finished near the day's highs.
   Jack Baker, head of institutional trading at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said the gains reflected a technical rebound from
Monday's selloff.
   ``People are nervous about yesterday's decline. There doesn't
seem to be any urgency to rush into stocks. I don't see the buying
there as any more than a knee-jerk reaction to yesterday's
decline,'' he said.
   Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical market analysis at A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said the market appeared to be
consolidating its gains of the past few weeks and expects prices to
trend gradually higher.
   ``The market is not acting like it is ready to start a serious
advance because we are not seeing cumulative buying by
institutional investors,'' he said.
   Traders remain skeptical about the direction of the economy. The
fear is that if the economy accelerates, inflation may rise as well
and the Federal Reserve will feel pressure to push interest rates
higher.
   In its latest economic report, the government lowered its
estimate of second-quarter economic growth from its estimate a
month ago.
   MKI's Jensen said that while the downward revision indicated a
more moderate pace expansion, he noted that positive development
was offset by an upward revision in a measure of inflation tied to
the GNP figures.
   As a result, Jensen said bond prices held in a narrow range for

<HEAD>Gold Prices Fall to 19-Month Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices fell to a 19-month low Tuesday on the New
York's Commodity Exchange as gold producers sold futures to hedge
against further declines in the cash market, analysts said.
   On other markets, coffee futures rallied strongly; pork futures
led the livestock complex higher; grains and soybeans were mixed;
energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.
   Gold for October delivery traded as low as $402.30 a troy ounce,
the lowest price since Feb. 24, 1987, when gold futures last dipped
below $400. Prices recovered a bit near the close when traders
holding short (sell) took profits by buying at the low levels,
analysts said.
   Gold producers were the among the heaviest sellers after the
market registered little interest in the Commerce Department's
report on the gross national product, said Bette Raptopoulos,
metals analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The report showed the U.S. economy expanded at a rate of 3.0
percent in the April-June quarter compared with a rate of 3.4
percent in the previous quarter.
   The GNP number added to the already bearish sentiment in the
inflation-sensitive gold market but another number in the report,
the GNP deflator, rose at an inflationary annual rate of 5.5
percent compared with 1.7 percent in the first quarter.
   The deflator reflects changes in buying patterns as well as
prices.
   Ms. Raptopolous said gold producers were watching the market's
reaction to the deflator and sold when the market failed to rally.
   John Norris, chief trader of precious metals for Citibank in New
York, said the sell-off reflected further bearishness in the market
``on the lack of any perception of inflation on the horizon.
   ``It could go through $400 and is going to get tested at that
level,'' he said.
   Silver futures followed gold lower on the Comex while platinum
futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Gold settled $3.90 to $4.70 lower with the contract for delivery
in October at $406.20 a troy ounce; silver was 11.8 cents to 12.8
cents lower with September at $6.252 a troy ounce; platinum was
$8.10 to $8.70 lower with October at $494.90 a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange amid optimism about negotiations between consumer and
producer nation-members of the International Coffee Organization.
   The ICO convened a two-week meeting in London on Monday to
discuss changes in its price-support policies.
   ``There seems to be an aura of cooperation and the prospects for
delegates completing their work by the first of October is very
bright at this point,'' said Bert Ruiz, a coffee broker with
Balfour Maclaine Corp in New York.
   Coffee settled 1.25 cents to 3.21 cents higher with September at
$1.23 a pound.
   Pork futures gained sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
on a mixture of chart-based factors and position-evening ahead of
the Agriculture Department's Sept. 30 hogs and pigs report, a
quarterly look at the size of the U.S. hog herd.
   Cattle futures gained on spillover buying from the pork market
and bullish attitudes about the long-term outlook for the
cattle-market, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .27 cent to .70 cent higher with October at
69.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .52 cent higher
with September at 80.37 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent to 1.25
cents higher with October at 38.77 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .95 cent to 1.17 cents higher with February at 50.70
cents a pound.
   Wheat and corn futures advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid rumors of new U.S. grain sales to the Soviet Union but
soybeans finished mixed on a lack of strong bullish signals.
   Wheat settled 5} cents to 8\ cents higher with September at
$4.04{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents lower to 2} cents higher with
September at $2.73} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents lower to 4 cents
higher with September at $2.50{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent
lower to 10{ cents higher with September at $8.20{ a bushel.
   Energy futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents lower to 31
cents higher with October at $15.04 a barrel; heating oil was .09
cent lower to .14 cent higher with October at 41.32 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .27 cent higher with October at
44.43 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .80 point higher at 272.65.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Triad Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved an
agreement under which Saudi businessmen Adnan and Essam Khashoggi
are to pay $32 million to creditors of Triad America Corp.
   Judge John H. Allen on Tuesday approved the agreement between
the Khashoggi brothers and R. Todd Neilson, the court-appointed
trustee for Triad.
   Triad, the Khashoggis' U.S. holding company, and eight
affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
January 1987, listing liabilities of $197.5 million and assets of
$9.5 million.
   The agreement, which was finalized Sept. 13 after months of
negotiations, calls for the Khashoggis to wire $32 million to a
bank account of Neilson's choosing by Oct. 31 if several conditions
are met, including the approval of the court.
   ``I genuinely believe this is all the money we can get,''
Neilson said in testimony Monday. ``We're not dealing with General
Motors. You don't go down and put a lien on their plant. We don't
even know where the plant is.''
   The Khashoggis' offer of a $32 million payment represents a
sincere desire to solve their problems in the United States,
Neilson said.
   He said the average creditor would probably get between 40 and
50 cents on the dollar.

<HEAD>News Corp. Sells Half-Interest in Elle Magazine to Hachette</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. said Tuesday it
had sold its half-interest in the Elle magazine joint ventures in
the United States and the United Kingdom to its lone partner,
France's Hachette Group.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a source familiar with
it and speaking on condition that he not be identified said the
price was about $150 million. The sale is subject to negotiation of
a definitive agreement.
   It was expected News Corp. would use the proceeds of the sale to
help finance its $3 billion acquisition of Triangle Publications
Inc., which publishes TV Guide, the Daily Racing Form and Seventeen
magazine.
   In a separate announcement, Murdoch and Walter Annenberg,
chairman of Triangle, said they had signed a merger agreement
providing for the purchase of Triangle. The two men had announced
in early August that they had agreed to the deal, subject to
reaching a definitive agreement, among other things.
   The Triangle purchase remains subject to obtaining necessary
government approvals and satisfaction of certain conditions in the
merger agreement, the statement said.
   Murdoch, chief executive of News Corp., has previously said he
would sell some assets to help finance the purchase of Triangle,
but had singled out only its stake in Reuters Holdings PLC and some
land in Britain and Australia. He has said his goal is to raise
half of the needed funds through asset sales and borrow the rest.
   The U.S. units of News Corp. and Hachette formed their joint
venture for a U.S. version of Elle magazine in September 1985 and
for the British version two months later. Hachette also publishes
nearly a dozen other versions of Elle.
   The U.S. version of the magazine, aimed at affluent,
fashion-conscious women, has proven quite successful with a monthly
circulation reaching 825,000 and advertising pages estimated at
2,150 this year.
   In a statement, Murdoch said the sale of its interest in Elle to
Hachette would put both companies ``in the best possible position
to pursue the full development of their own magazine interests in
the U.S. and the U.K.''
   He noted News Corp. and Hachette continued to publish jointly
two magazines, Premiere and Sky.
   Daniel Filipacchi, vice chairman of Hachette Group, said Elle
will become part of Hachette's Diamandis Communications Inc. unit,
which Hachette acquired earlier this year and publishes 13 major
magazines, including Road & Track, Memories and Car and Driver.
   In that connection, Diamandis announced that Anne Sutherland
Fuchs, the vice president and publisher of its Woman's Day
magazine, would become senior vice president and publisher of Elle.
   Robert Mate, vice president and advertising director for Woman's
Day, moves up to publisher at that magazine, the announcement said.

<HEAD>Texaco Responds To Ecuador Move On Oil Operations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. will continue operating in
Ecuador until the Ecuadoran government takes complete control over
the pipeline and oilfield operations the two now run jointly, a
company spokesman announced Tuesday.
   Ecuador's new Center Left government, headed by President
Rodrigo Borja, announced Monday night it woudl assume control of
the trans-Ecuadorian pipeline next year and take over oilfield
operations in 1990 when its contract with the state Compania
Ecuatoriano de Petroleo (CEPE) expires.
   Texaco manages 37.5 percent of Ecuador's petroleum industry. Oil
accounts for about two-thirds of Ecuador's export revenue.
   ``The announcement surprised us, though we knew it would
eventually happen,'' Rodrigo Perez, a Texaco spokesman, said at a
Quito press conference.
   Perez told reporters the government failed to notify Texaco
about its plans and said the U.S. oil giant would have preferred
prior talks with the government. But he added: ``the government is
exercising its rights according to existing contracts.''
   Under its agreements with Texaco, CEPE can take over the
company's operations provided it notifies the firm of its plans a
year in advance.
   A minor controversy arose Monday when a government spokesman
termed the takeover a ``nationalization.'' The government later
announced it simply was fulfilling the terms of its contract with
Texaco, and not nationalizing its assets.

<HEAD>Galanis Cohort Gets 20 Years for Racketeering, Banking Schemes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Connecticut bank president, convicted
of federal racketeering and bribe-related charges for his part in
the multi-million dollar fraud schemes of John Peter Galanis, was
sentenced to 20 years in prison Tuesday.
   ``I think you're dangerous,'' U.S. District Judge Charles L.
Brieant told Anthony J. Marchese before sentencing him to 15 years
for racketeering and an additional five years for crossing state
lines to commit bribery.
   Marchese, 48, of Southport, Conn., could have been sentenced to
a maximum 55 years in prison and $530,000 in fines.
   Brieant ruled that Marchese, who was defended by a
court-appointed lawyer, had no capability to pay fines or make
restitution.
   A federal court jury in White Plains, N.Y. had convicted
Marchese and Galanis, 45, of Del Mar, Calif., and formerly of
Greenwich, Conn., on July 5 of participating in a racketeering
enterprise that looted banks, fleeced investors and defrauded the
government of taxes.
   Prosecutors contended Galanis masterminded a phony oil- and
gas-drilling tax shelter scheme that netted more than $172 million
in fraudulent tax writeoffs for about 2,500 investors.
   The so-called ``Galanis organization'' also left a Rockland
County, N.Y., bank insolvent, fraudulently took over a Westport,
Conn. bank, forced Utah banking officials to take over another
financial institution in Salt Lake City, and stole $3.9 million
from three California mutual funds.
   Marchese was acquitted of involvement in the oil and gas shelter
scheme but was convicted of helping bribe officials of the Peoples
National Bank of Rockland County in Monsey, N.Y. and defraud Utah
bank officials. He was not charged in the other fraud schemes.
   Evidence at the three-month trial showed Marchese paid $240,000
in bribes to Peoples National Bank's chairman and another $12,000
to its senior vice president to get the bank to buy more than $17
million in promissory notes from Galanis-controlled entities.
   On Sept. 13, 1985, the Rockland County bank was declared
insolvent and taken over by the federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Marchese, who worked at banks in New Jersey and Connecticut and
was president of Metropolitan Bank & Trust in Bridgeport, Conn., in
the 1970s, also helped the Galanis organization take over the Utah
bank.
   Through the racketeering conviction, the jury found Marchese had
helped make fraudulent misrepresentations to state and federal
regulators to secure controlling interest in Heritage Bank & Trust
of Salt Lake City and to obtain a $4.5 million cash loan.
   In April 1987, Utah's Department of Financial Institutions had
to take over Heritage.
   ``As of this minute, I still don't feel that I've done anything
illegal other than possibly to have much too narrow a focus and
concentrate only on the banking aspects,'' Marchese told the judge
before his sentencing in Manhattan.
   As a former bank president, Marchese ``was extremely valuable to
the Galanis organization,'' said Brieant.
   The judge said Marchese had ``no remorse and no understanding''
of why he was convicted. ``I think you're dangerous to yourself and
to others because of what you did and your lack of understanding.''
   Brieant is to sentence Galanis, who faces a maximum penalty of
207 years in prison and $8 million in fines, on Sept. 28 in White
Plains.

   Share prices fell sharply after a slight rebound in
morning trading Wednesday, while the U.S. dollar inched up against
the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Exchange of 225 selected issues, a 352.42-point
loser Tuesday, closed the morning session down another 253.02
points at 27,295.56, after rising slightly in the minutes of
trading.
   ``Share prices were lower across the board, even print-related
issues declined,'' a Nomura Securities' analyst said.
   ``Participants just didn't know what to do because they were
worried about what would happen to the stock market in case the
emperor died. So most of them were trying to get rid of the issues
they were unsure of in the future,'' he said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The Imperial Household Agency said Wednesday morning that
Emperor Hirohito's condition was improving after three blood
transfusions and other treatment Tuesday. News reports said he has
been in serious condition since vomiting blood Monday night and
early Tuesday morning.
   The analyst also said investors were pessimistic over the
decline in the growth rate of Japan's gross national product for
the second quarter, which was reported Tuesday.
   The Economic Planning Agency reported Japan's gross national
product for the April-June period was 3.9 percent, down 0.1 percent
from the previous quarter. According to the EPA report, it was the
first decline after increases in the last nine quarters.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar was quoted at 134.18 yen by late
morning, up from 134.15 yen at Tuesday's close and from 134.05 yen
at the opening of trading.
