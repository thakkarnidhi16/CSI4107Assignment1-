   The Associated Press reported erroneously on
Oct. 19 that one of two new members of the National Association of
Evangelicals was the General Association of Regular Baptists.
   The denomination that joined the national group, which represents
most conservative churches in the country, was the 80,000-member
General Association of General Baptists.

<HEAD>Some Military Facilities May Be Converted Into Drug Rehab Centers</HEAD>

   Some unused military facilities may be turned
into drug treatment centers under an administration program that
would call on the resources of the government's two largest
departments.
   Officials acknowledged at a news conference Friday that the
``memorandum of understanding'' signed by the departments of defense
and health and human services is essentially a starting point rather
than a fleshed out program.
   It calls for the health department to identify areas where the
need for expanded drug treatment capacity is greatest and the
defense department then to see if it has any spare space in those
areas that could be used as is, or renovated.
   The actual centers would be operated along the same lines as
existing public drug treatment facilities typically run by state and
local health officials.
   The new program is an initiative of the National Drug Policy
Board, a Cabinet-level group headed by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   Joining Thornburgh and HHS Secretary Otis R. Bowen at a ceremony
where the agreement was signed was William Howard Taft IV, deputy
secretary of defense.
   They had no estimate how many military bases eventually might be
used, or when.
   However, Bowen _ who has pushed within the administration for
more emphasis on drug treatment _ said it would be unrealistic to
expect that any new slots would be in operation by the time
President Reagan leaves office in January.
   Bowen said there are now only 250,000 drug treatment slots
nationwide to deal with an estimated 6.5 million addicts.
   The new program carries no price tag, in part because the
eventual scope has yet to be determined and in part because the idea
is to use existing funds, including millions in the huge drug bill
just passed by Congress, that often are not spent because of the
difficulty in finding locations for drug treatment centers.
   Many people resist having such facilities in their neighborhoods
and turning to military bases for space should lessen that problem,
said Bowen.
   Bowen said ``treatment may be the only answer for millions of
Americans'' already hooked on drugs, but that it is not an easy
answer because many relapse and require long-term treatment.
   ``This gets to the heart of the matter,'' said Bowen. ``Because
there are no easy solutions, the administration and Congress face
enormous difficulties in sustaining fiscal and political support for
treatment.
   ``Obviously, it would be better if Americans were persuaded to
ignore the temptation of drugs or deterred from illicit drug use,''
he said. ``But treatment is the only answer for the millions of
Americans who, for one reason or another, want to say no, but
can't.''

   A manufacturing partnership has won an Army
contract to develop an engine for the service's next generation of
helicopters, and American Telephone & Telegraph Co. won a spirited
competition to supply the Pentagon with new computers.
   The Army selected a partnership formed by divisions of General
Motors Corp. and Allied Signal Aerospace Co. to develop the engine
for its new light attack and observation helicopter for use beyond
the end of this century.
   The new craft is to replace aging fleets of Vietnam-era AH-1
Cobra, OH-6 Cayuse and OH-58 Kiowa choppers.
   The winning team, called Light Helicopter Turbine Co., is
composed of the GM's Allison Gas Turbine Division and Allied
Signal's Garrett Engine Division. The group previously had received
a contract worth $132.4 million and the deal announced Friday was
for another $75.4 million to continue the work.
   The two partners are expected eventually to compete for
production awards. The engine work ultimately is expected to be
worth more than $1.5 billion to the two companies.
   First deliveries are scheduled for 1995.
   The Army also gave the go-ahead to two other groups to compete
for the job of designing the rest of the chopper. One of the groups
is a joint venture of Boeing Helicopters and United Technology's
Sikorsky Aircraft; the other is a partnership that includes units of
McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. Each team
received $158 million to pursue their design work.
   The Army hopes to purchase 2,096 of the new helicopters at a cost
of roughly $40 billion.
   The computer contract awarded to AT&T, for $929.1 million,
establishes the company's position in the industry for years to come
with what has been described as the computer contract of the century.
   The Air Force, which acted as the executive agent for the other
services in overseeing the bidding, said an AT&T subsidiary, AT&T
Technologies Inc., had been selected over five competitors and would
be expected to deliver about 20,000 minicomputers over the next five
years.
   AT&T said the award was the largest computer contract ever
awarded by the federal government. Company officials said the value
could exceed $1 billion depending on the options exercised.
   The Air Force is buying the computers for its own use as well as
that of the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Defense Communications Agency
and Defense Logistics Agency.

   The control tower at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport should be back to full strength by May, ending
a staff shortage that led to a record number of flight-handling
errors at the nation's busiest airport, Sen. Paul Simon said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has set May 1 _ the starting
date for a planned salary incentive program _ as its target date for
doubling the number of experienced air traffic controllers at
O'Hare, Simon, D-Ill., said Friday.
   Increasing the number of journeyman controllers at O'Hare is the
top priority in a detailed FAA plan to improve operations at the
airport, the senator said.
   In a report submitted Friday to Simon and other lawmakers, the
agency outlined 100 such improvements and set a timetable for
accomplishing each.
   ``This action plan we now have really means the beginning of the
end of a significant threat to air safety at O'Hare,'' Simon said.
   O'Hare controllers have had 30 flight-handling errors so far this
year compared with 12 in all of 1987 and their previous record of 22
in 1986.

<HEAD>Shultz Warns of Spread of Ballistic Missiles, Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz says the
``shadow of a third world war has faded'' but that the growing
availability of two types of non-nuclear weaponry is heightening the
potential for devastation in global trouble spots.
   In a speech Friday night, Shultz said the spread of sophisticated
missile technology and the use of chemical weapons have become major
sources of concern just as offensive nuclear weapons are being cut
back and there is less danger of new countries being added to the
nuclear club.
   ``The worst nightmare of all,'' Shultz said, ``would be the
eventual combination of ballistics missiles and chemical weapons in
the hands of governments with terrorist histories.''
   Shultz spoke to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco. Copies of
his remarks were made available by the State Department.
   These weapons, Shultz said, ``increase the potential for
devastation in unstable regions of the Third World. And the
conflicts themselves may be far more difficult to contain or
isolate.''
   Shultz said that both belligerents in the Iran-Iraq war used
Soviet SCUD missiles and that Saudi Arabia is acquiring Chinese
CSS-2 missiles with a potential range exceeding 1,500 miles.
   ``These missiles, which may be thought of as `obsolete' by the
superpowers, are nothing of the sort when it comes to regional
conflicts,'' Shultz said.
   ``And beyond the arms market, more and more nations will be able
to build their own ballistics missiles. Weaponry of enormous
destructive potential can reach the hands of parties with little
regard for traditional inhibiting controls.''
   He said another new danger is the reappearance of chemical
warfare _ ``perhaps the most odious and despicable development of
our day.''
   Only a handful of the hundreds of conflicts since World War II
had witnessed the use of chemical weapons but ``now the scourge is
spreading,'' he said.
   Shultz did not single out any nation in the speech but he
strongly criticized Iraq two months ago for its alleged use of
chemical weapons against its Kurdish minority.
   The administration earlier had criticized both Iran and Iraq for
resorting to chemical weapons in their conflict. It had said that
Iraqi use of such weaponry was far more extensive.
   Shultz said that at a January conference in Paris on
strengthening an international agreement that prohibits chemical
warfare, the U.S. goal will be to ``reverse the erosion of respect
for the norms which have held the line against the use of such
hideous weapons.''

   A former Mexican policeman was sentenced
Friday to 240 years plus life in prison for the 1985 torture-murder
of a U.S. drug agent and his pilot.
   Raul Lopez Alvarez, 29, was convicted along with two other
Mexican men in the 1985 torture-murder of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala
Avelar.
   U.S. District Court Judge Edward Rafeedie sentenced Lopez to five
terms of 60 years each, to run concurrently with a life term. In
addition, he sentenced him to 10 years for aiding and abetting on a
charge of being an accessory after the fact but ordered that that
run concurrently with the 240 years.
   He also ordered that Lopez not be eligible for parole until he
has served a minimum of 60 years in prison.
   Lopez, who went to school in Los Angeles but returned to his
Mexican homeland and became a member of the state judicial police of
Guadalajara, was found guilty of two counts of committing violent
acts in support of racketeering as well as conspiracy to kidnapping,
felony murder and accessory after the fact.
   His sentence was alomost identical to one imposed Wednesday on a
co-defendant, Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, whose attorneys also argued
he had been unjustly convicted of a crime he did not commit.
   The judge also had imposed a 10-year sentence on Jesus Felix
Gutierrez, 38, a former Los Angeles seafood store owner convicted of
aiding Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero in his escape from
Mexico to Costa Rica after the murders.
   Camarena was abducted Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara. His body and
Zavala's were found buried at a remote ranch weeks later. They were
severly beaten and Camarena's skull was crushed.
   The case stirred bitter feelings between Mexican and American
officials when Mexican police were linked to the killing and to
Caro's escape.
   Lopez was convicted on the basis of his own words. He was
videotaped boasting to an undercover agent about the Camarena
murder, saying that it was ``a mistake.''
   The prosecutor, assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmy Gurule, called
Lopez a ``cold-blooded killer,'' and said he had openly boasted of
participating in grotesque torture techniques and murders not only
in this case but in others.
   ``These crimes are inhuman and barbaric and justify no mercy on
the part of this court,'' he said, adding that he wished the death
penalty was available for Lopez.

<HEAD>FAA To Inspect DC-9 Fleet After Cracks Uncovered in Three Aircraft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration says the
discovery of cracks in three DC-9 airplanes may warrant an in-depth
inspection of the entire fleet of passenger jets.
   The agency announced Friday it had ``uncovered a series of small
cracks in three DC-9 aircraft,'' flown by Northwest Airlines and
USAir Group Inc.
   ``As a result of this finding, FAA plans to order shortly an
in-depth inspection of the DC-9 fleet,'' said agency spokesman Bob
Buckhorn.
   Buckhorn said the FAA would wait until inspections already under
way were completed before the agency ordered the inspection of all
DC-9s.
   ``The cracks, the longest of which was approximately one inch,
are located in the uppermost area of the fuselage over the wing,''
he added.
   The announcement came a day after the FAA said it would speed up
inspection and replacement of 7,200 rivets on almost 300 of the
oldest Boeing 737s. The roof of one of those planes, flown by Aloha
Airlines, tore off during flight April 28, killing one person and
injuring 61. The rivets are believed to cause cracks in the fuselage
skin of older Boeing 737s.
   The agency said the cracks in the DC-9s, manufactured by Douglas
Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnell Douglas Corp., were ``in no
manner comparable to the recent cracks discovered in Boeing 737
aircraft fuselage joints.''
   The agency noted that corrosion was not a factor in the
development of the DC-9 cracks and emphasized that the cracks do not
mean the passenger jets are unsafe.
   ``I am confident that these cracks could not become a threat to
the structural integrity of the aircraft,'' FAA Administrator T.
Allan McArtor said in a statement.
   ``We're talking about very small cracks. We're not talking about
the kind of thing we found in the Boeings,'' said Buckhorn.
   ``The early discovery of the DC-9 cracks validates the
effectiveness of the FAA structural inspection program,'' instituted
in the early 1980s to provide early detection of structural fatigue
in older planes, McArtor added.
   The fuselage cracks were found on older aircraft which had
between 65,000 and 70,000 landings, and the agency's more extensive
inspection could involve up to 200 of the oldest planes.
   Elayne Bendel, a spokeswoman for Douglas Aircraft, also praised
the FAA inspection program, saying, ``It was intended to find small
problems and get them fixed.''
   In a telephone interview from her office in Long Beach, Calif.,
where the planes are built, Bendel said operators had been informed
the cracks were found and the company ``would be issuing an alert
service bulletin that would provide for some inspection procedure
and a recommended time in which this service should be done.''
   A USAir official said the company was inspecting its fleet of 74
DC-9s and had found several cracks in the aircraft.
   ``We have found several cracks in the stringers, a joining piece
of metal,'' said spokesman David Shipley. ``These cracks seem to be
located in the section over the forward emergency exit window and
back about eight rows. But we have found nothing of a serious
nature. These are not cracks of major structural systems.''
   The company said only 37 of its aircraft which had made 60,000 or
more landings would be included in the inspection.
   Officials at Northwest were unavailable Friday night for comment
on the FAA's proposed action.
   The agency said it also would recommend DC-9 aircraft outside the
United States be inspected.

   Special Israeli army undercover
units are operating in the occupied territories to identify
Palestinian activists in the Arab uprising.
   Existence of the units and reports that Palestinians have been
killed by Israelis dressed in civilian clothes have triggered
widespread rumors that undercover military squads had been formed to
assassinate activists on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Both Palestinian human rights investigators and army officials
have agreed there was no evidence to suggest the army sanctioned
assassination squads or the systematic killing of Palestinians.
   Arabs have claimed that Israelis dressed in civilian clothes and
driving unmarked vehicles have being involved in at least four
incidents in which Palestinians were shot. Three Palestinians were
killed and three wounded in the shootings, the Arabs claim.
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said on Israel radio ``there
is no army unit that is above the law, that has the right to kill or
eliminate someone.''
   Field worker Khalid Batrawi said Law in the Service of Man, an
organization affilated with the Geneva-based International
Commission of Jurists, has investigated incidents in which
Palestinians were killed or wounded by Israelis wearing civilian or
Arab clothes and operating with army backup.
   ``There isn't one case where we can claim the army came to kill a
particular person,'' he said. ``But there are many cases where there
was no reason for the army to shoot.''
   Security sources and Israeli soldiers, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that undercover military units
operate in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. According to foreign
published reports, two units use the code names ``Cherry'' and
``Samson.''
   Reports have said their mission was to identify Arab ringleaders
and demonstration organizers.
   The army units are distinct from the Shin Bet security forces,
which have operated in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since Israel
seized the territory in the 1967 Middle East war.
   An Israeli source familiar with the army units said they did not
have orders to shoot and any use of violence was an exception to
standing orders.
   Unit members carry weapons and usually wear T-shirts over
army-issue khaki-colored pants. They sometimes masquerade as Arabs,
donning traditional keffiyeh headdresses and driving vehicles with
distinctive license plates reserved for Arab-owned cars _ blue in
the West Bank and white in the Gaza Strip.
   Although there was no indication the units had a license to kill,
questions have been raised about their tactics.
   Dedi Zucker, a member of the Israeli Parliament, said that in
response to his inquiry, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin had
confirmed the army uses confiscated Arab cars. ``Rabin claimed this
is legal and done officially,'' he said.
   The correspondent for the Financial Times of London and two
Reuters journalists had their press credentials suspended by the
government and are being investigated by police for reporting on the
undercover units without submitting their stories to censorship.
   Villagers in Yatta told the AP that on Oct. 9 two Palestinians
were gunned down by a group of about eight Israelis who jumped out
of a cream-colored Ford Transit van bearing West Bank license plates.
   The gunmen wore T-shirts and khaki, army-style pants and carried
pistols and automatic weapons, according to a witness, Moussa Al
Sari, an uncle of one of the slain men.
   Al Sari said Fadel Ibrahim Shehadeh Al Najar, 25, and Kamal
Mahmoud Al Sari, 24, were walking down Yatta's main road when the
van pulled up alongside them.
   ``The Israelis got a good look at them and then they opened fire.
They knew who they were after,'' claimed the elder Al Sari, adding
that the men were sprayed with submachine gun fire from a distance
of about three yards.
   Family members said both men were wanted by the authorities for
anti-Israeli activism and had been in hiding to elude troops who
frequently searched their houses. They said about 60 youths had
thrown stones at the van an hour earlier.
   An army spokesman said the men were shot by soldiers who opened
fire after their lives were threatened by a stone-throwing mob. He
said one of the men was wanted by security forces.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, the deputy army spokesman, said the military
police had launched a routine investigation into the incident to
insure ``the firing was called for, that it was a life endangering
situation.''
   Three signed affidavits collected by Law in the Service of Man
describe incidents similar to the Yatta shooting elsewhere in the
West Bank.
   Sultan Abu Hassan, 21, said he was hit with 11 bullets fired by
Israelis who wore T-shirts, khaki pants and Arab headdresses.
Another man, Mohammed Abu Salah, 38, was killed in the attack.
   In the sworn statement, Abu Hassan said the Israelis were driving
a white Ford Cortina with Arab plates when they stopped at a
roadblock he was manning at the entrance to the village of Silat al
Harithyya, north of Nablus.
   Abu Sultan said the driver told him in Arabic he wanted to enter
the village, then four men emerged from the car and opened fire.

   Human remains unearthed by a construction
crew this week belong to ``Praying Indians'' from about 1700, the
state archaeologist says.
   Skeletal and dental features helped researchers determine that
the bodies found in burial grounds dating to the late 1600s or early
1700s were Indians, Brona G. Simon, the archaeologist, said Friday.
   ``They were known as Praying Indians, which was the common term
used for Indians associated with Christian churches set up to
missionize the Indians,'' Simon said.
   She said the fact that they were buried in coffins showed they
were Indians who had converted to Christianity. Simon believes there
are at least six Indians buried at the site in this Boston suburb.
   ``This site is very unique in that it's a Praying Indians site;
there were only 16 Praying Indian (communities) found in
Massachusetts,'' she said. ``Most sites have been built upon.''
   The exact number of bodies at the site will not be determined
until after the boundaries of the burial ground are determined.
   ``We haven't really exposed many of the skeletons to see what's
inside the coffins. The whole point of this is to preserve the
site,'' Simon said.
   The burial ground will be left intact and the developer of the
subdivision whose crew unearthed the cemetery has agreed to
rearrange his development to accommodate preservationists.
   ``It looks like there are many opportunities for the developer to
go ahead and the burial ground to be preserved,'' Simon said.

   The Soviet Union postponed for four hours the
unmanned maiden launch of its space shuttle Buran from a pad in
Soviet Central Asia early Saturday, but there was no immediate word
on what caused the delay.
   ``According to reports from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the launch
of the Soviet reusable space craft Buran has been postponed,''
official Radio Moscow said in a broadcast.
   The official Soviet news agency, Tass, said there had been a
four-hour delay in the prestart preparations, but did not say why.
   Technicians had worked around the clock Friday on a floodlit
launch pad, preparing for the brief flight of the shuttle, billed as
safer, more flexible and more powerful than the U.S. orbiter it
resembles.
   The launch of the black-and-white winged Buran, or Snowstorm,
shuttle attached to the Energiya booster _ the world's most powerful
rocket _ had been scheduled for 6:23 a.m. Moscow time Saturday
(11:23 p.m. EDT Friday) at the pad in the republic of Kazakhstan.
   The shuttle will orbit Earth twice and then, ``obeying its
electronic brain and the radio commands from Earth, will land on a
paved runway 12 kilometers (eight miles) from the launch complex,''
Tass said. No landing time was given.
   In a report on launch preparations late Friday, state-run
television provided the first confirmation that the military is
involved in the shuttle program.
   ``As always in our country, military specialists participate in
crucial, dangerous tests,'' a correspondent said, reporting from
Baikonur.
   The report said the military official overseeing shuttle
operations is Alexander A. Maksimov, ``chief specialist of the
Defense Ministry on multiple-use space transport systems and the
prospect of their development.''
   Military involvement could be one reason Soviet officials have
withheld details of their shuttle program. Officials have said
throughout the year that a launch was imminent, but gave a date for
it only on Wednesday.
   Soviet officials and media repeatedly have criticized military
uses of the American space shuttle.
   The U.S. Defense Department, in its 1988 publication Soviet
Military Power, says the Soviets might use their shuttle to deploy
anti-satellite and ballistic missile defense weapons ``and other
space-based components of the Soviet strategic defense program.''
   The TV showed Maksimov speaking to Baikonur workers at an outdoor
ceremony.
   ``Truly this is a historic task,'' he said. ``Today's launch we
can compare to the launch of the first artificial satellite.''
   The Soviet Union began the space age in 1957 with the launch of
Sputnik.
   The evening news also showed the chairman of the government
commission on shuttle construction and launch, Vitaly V. Doguzhiev,
speaking to Baikonur workers.
   ``Qualified and responsible people are gathered here. But ... the
main thing nonetheless has always been and remains quality. In the
name of the government commission, I ask you very much, I beg you _
quality and only quality,'' Doguzhiev said nervously.
   News reports indicated the mission would be entirely devoted to
checking out the craft's onboard systems and the shuttle would not
deploy satellites or conduct any other tasks.
   Soviet newspapers said the shuttle has room for a maximum of 10
people _ up to four cosmonauts and six passengers. They said
Energiya and Buran cost about the same as the U.S. shuttle, about
$10 billion.
   Communications with the craft will be controlled via four ships
in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, four satellite systems and
ground stations.
   On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskykh said the
launch would be televised live in the Soviet Union, but on Friday he
said he could no longer ensure a live broadcast. Foreign reporters
were not allowed to travel to Baikonur.
   Technicians worked around the clock by the light of 670
spotlights, filling the four first-stage rockets with kerosene and
oxygen, and the second stage with liquid oxygen and hydrogen.
   Soviet officials once criticized the U.S. space shuttle, which
made its first flight in 1981, as wasteful and unreliable, but have
been developing their own look-alike for years.
   The shuttle, like the American version, is attached to smaller
first-stage rockets and one large booster. But the newspaper
Socialist Industry told its readers to ignore the similarities.
   The automatic system that allows the Buran to be completely
guided from the ground not only makes the initial flight safer, but
in the future will give teh crew more flexibility, it said.
   ``It ... gives it the possibility of engaging first of all in
experiments in space and increases the reliability of all systems,''
the newspaper said, adding that cosmonauts can take control of it at
any time.
   Soviet officials have said the flight is unmanned to avoid
risking the lives of its crew. They cite the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion of the U.S. shuttle Challenger, in which seven crew
members died, as an example of the dangers.
   The labor newspaper Trud said the Energiya-Buran's four
liquid-fuel first stage rockets allow it to continue flying even if
one fails, unlike the U.S. shuttle's two solid-fuel rockets.
   The Buran has a capacity of 66,000 pounds, compared with the U.S.
shuttle's 55,000 pounds. Energiya can lift more than 100 tons.
   Energiya has been used only once before, in May 1987. Its payload
failed to reach orbit, but Soviet space officials have said the
problem was with the guidance system of the payload, not with
Energiya.

<HEAD>Survey: Jews Increasingly Worried About Anti-Semitism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jews in the United States are growing increasingly
worried about anti-Semitism, in part because of concerns about the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, according to a survey released by the American
Jewish Committee.
   Jackson's attitude toward Jews first became a political issue
while he was seeking the Democratic nomination in the 1984
presidential race. He called New York ``Hymietown;'' embraced Yasser
Arafat, the chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization; and
appeared publicly with Black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan.
   The national survey of more than 1,200 Jews found that 75 percent
were worried that anti-Semitism was becoming a major problem in
America. In 1983, the first time the organization asked that
question, 45 percent of the respondents said they were worried.
   ``One has to understand that Jews, even in a free society, have a
residual memory of danger,'' Ira Silverman, director of the New
York-based organization, said Friday.
   ``There's hardly been a society where Jews have felt perfectly
safe. ... It is possible that the openness of black anti-Semitism
within the last year or more has exacerbated the worry of Jews. If
they see anti-Semitism spoken openly and not being decried by
others, that becomes very worrisome,'' Silverman said.
   One survey question was, ``Is Jesse Jackson anti-Semitic?''
Fifty-nine percent said yes, 10 percent said no, and 31 percent said
``not sure.'' On another question, 32 percent said they believed
``many'' blacks are anti-Semites.
   A Jackson spokesman at his Rainbow Coalition headquarters in
Chicago said Jackson stands with Jews, not against them.
   ``They have no basis for such an accusation'' of anti-Semitism,
said Jackson's press secretary, Frank Watkins. ``Black people are
not the enemy of Jewish people.''
   Surveys of non-Jews have found anti-Jewish bigotry apparently
waning, which Silverman called a perception gap. ``Attitudes towards
Jews are improving, which should be encouraging, but many Jews don't
believe it,'' he said.
   The findings were contained in a study of political and social
attitudes by sociologist Steven Cohen of Queens College in New York.
Cohen based his findings on twin surveys by Market Facts Inc. of
1,252 Jews and 1,217 non-Jews in April and May.
   The surveys used a representative sample of Jews and non-Jews
around the country. They did not include a margin of error.
   Findings included:
   _87 percent of Jews favored keeping abortion legal, as did 45
percent of white non-Jews and 41 percent of blacks.
   _85 percent of Jews supported equal rights for homosexuals, as
did 70 percent of blacks and 57 percent of non-Jewish whites.
   _Among Jews, Democrats outnumbered Republicans 61 percent to 14
percent, a ratio of more than 4-1. Among white non-Jews, the
proportion was about even.
   _Liberals outnumbered conservatives among the Jews surveyed, 33
percent to 21 percent. Among white non-Jews surveyed, twice as many
described themselves as conservative as opposed to liberal, 36
percent to 17 percent.
   _25 percent of the Jews surveyed said they felt virtually all
positions of influence in America are open to Jews.
   Founded in 1906, the 50,000-member American Jewish Committee
works at building bridges between Jews and other groups as well as
defending the interests of Israel and Soviet Jewry.

<HEAD>Julie Christie _ From `Darling' To `Dadah'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Julie Christie turned down all offers to appear on
American television until the CBS film ``Dadah Is Death,'' which she
said gave her the opportunity to play ``a strong middle-aged woman
fighting to the end for something.''
   ``I thought it was a wonderful part, and they don't come along
that often,'' she said of the four-hour miniseries. The film, which
marks the Oscar-winning actress' debut on American television, will
be shown in two parts Sunday and Wednesday.
   Directed by Jerry London, ``Dadah Is Death'' is based on the
story of Australians Kevin Barlow and Geoffrey Chambers, who were
hanged in Malaysia in 1986 after being convicted of trafficking in
heroin.
   They were the first Westerners executed under Malaysian drug
laws. The word dadah is Malay slang for drugs.
   Ms. Christie plays Barlow's mother Barbara, who campaigned
furiously but unsuccessfully to save her 26-year-old son. Victor
Banerjee, who played Dr. Aziz in the movie ``A Passage To India,''
co-stars as Karpal Singh, Barlow's lawyer.
   Born in India into an English tea-planting family, Ms. Christie
won an Academy Award in 1965 for ``Darling,'' which was about the
spirit of London in the 1960s.
   She played Lara in ``Dr. Zhivago'' and received further acclaim
for her performances in ``McCabe and Mrs. Miller,'' ``Shampoo,''
``Heaven Can Wait,'' ``Don't Look Now'' and ``The Go-Between.''
   She left the glamour of Hollywood 11 years ago for a stone
farmhouse in Wales. At 48 her choice of roles involves low-budget,
provocative films such as James Ivory's ``Heat and Dust'' and ``Miss
Mary'' by Argentine filmmaker Maria Luisa Bemberg.
   In an interview at a friend's apartment in London she was asked
about her role as Barbara Barlow.
   ``I usually find (American) miniseries extremely sentimental .. .
I didn't think this was,'' she said.
   ``It's dealing with a tricky subject. I mean I was horrified
about the fact that in Australia there was a TV (public opinion)
poll, if you can imagine anything so indecent, asking viewers to
send in their verdict whether the boys should be hanged.
   ``Sixty percent rang in saying they should be. Barbara had to
bear the impact of this kind of expression of hatred.''
   Ms. Christie said the film did not pass judgment but showed the
convicted men ``caught up within wheels within wheels within
wheels.''
   ``There's a lot of ambiguity in this,'' she said. ``The boys
should be presented as villains in the popular sense of people who
go around with drugs at the moment, and in fact they are presented
as what they are: human beings.''
   ``Dadah Is Death'' focuses on individuals, not on politics, but
Ms. Christie has become increasinly involved in political issues.
   Earlier this year she narrated a film for Oxfam, the British
relief organization, about Cambodia, and she has taken stands on
vivisection, homelessness and nuclear arms.
   When President Reagan gave a speech in London last May she was
outside the hall with a placard denouncing U.S. policy in Latin
America.
   ``If you're personally hurt by something, I think it's terribly
frustrating not to try and do something about it,'' she said.
``Thousands and thousands of people are disturbed by what is
happening all over the world but can't be heard. We can be heard _
people with a name can be heard.''
   Ms. Christie was asked about her years in Los Angeles where she
was the frequent companion of actor Warren Beatty.
   She said she disliked the materialism _ the ``acceptance of
affluence without questioning how any of it arrived.''
   ``What kept me there were my relationships with various fellas,''
she added without elaborating. She has never married.
   Ms. Christie said she occasionally visits London on business and
to see new movies and that the long periods between acting roles do
not bother her.
   ``Something always turns up,'' she said. ``Meanwhile there's
always plenty to do, plenty to see, plenty to learn.''

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo says there's
nothing to reports of a possible romance between his son Andrew and
Robert and Ethel Kennedy's daughter, Kerry.
   Andrew and Kerry have had ``a couple of dates'' and Kerry
attended a wake last week for Andrew's maternal grandfather, Cuomo
said Friday.
   Several New York newspapers reported this week on the friendship.
   ``Kerry's a friend of mine and that's all there is to it,''
Andrew Cuomo told Newsday.
   Andrew Cuomo, 30, recently said he was leaving his Park Avenue
law firm in New York City to devote energy to his program that
builds housing for homeless families. He is considered a potential
congressional candidate in 1990 or 1992. Kerry Kennedy, 28, is
executive director of the RFK Memorial Center for Human Rights.
   The governor said his son also has been spending time with New
York University law student John Kennedy, son of the late president,
and helped John prepare the speech he delivered to the Democratic
National Convention in July.

   Actress Sigourney Weaver, who
starred in ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' says her next role is to
promote an ``Adopt A Gorilla'' campaign to raise money for the
endangered animal's survival.
   Weaver this week was named honorary chairman of the Digit Fund,
set up by the late anthropologist Dian Fossey, whom Ms. Weaver
portrays in the movie. Ms. Fossey was slain nearly three years ago
at her gorilla research center in the Virunga mountains of Rwanda.
   ``Most people love animals,'' Ms. Weaver said in announcing the
program. ``It's a short step to loving the more exotic animals and
realizing they're equal citizens of the Earth with us.''
   Proceeds from the fund will be used to maintain the Karisoke
Research Center, which studies behavioral characteristics of
gorillas and destroys poachers' traps. Donors will be sent adoption
papers for a gorilla, including a photograph of the animal and a
genealogy chart.

   ``Aztec Songs,'' a choral symphony
premiering at the great pyramids of Teotihuacan, had to be written
in a 500-year-old Indian language, but composer Lalo Schifrin can't
quite say why.
   ``It's magic,'' said Schiffren before an orchestra rehearsal at
the open-air site Friday. ``Who knows where that comes from?''
   Spanish tenor Placido Domingo heads the cast for ``Aztec Songs,''
which is based on the poetry of Nezahualcoyotl, a ruler of the
Nahuatl tribe who died in 1472.
   The songs will be performed in Nahuatl, a native Mexican tongue
that gave the world the word for chocolate.
   ``I can't really explain directly why I wrote the piece in
Nahuatl,'' said Schifrin. ``I found it to be a very sweet, musical
language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting
melodies.
   ``But the real answer is that there's something magic about it,
that it inspired me,'' he said. ``There's something magic in the art
of music anyway.''
   About 10,000 people were expected at the spectacle today about 25

   The Reagan administration has rejected a rice
industry request for a federal investigation of Japanese barriers to
rice imports, averting a political storm in Japan and threatening
one in the United States.
   The decision announced Friday was something of a surprise and was
the first important test of the new, tougher 1988 Omnibus Trade Act
that was designed to help restore the competitiveness of American
goods on foreign markets.
   Disappointed U.S. rice industry officials condemned the decision
and said in a statement that it hoped the new administration to take
office in January ``will be more concerned about promoting U.S.
interests than pleasing foreign governments ...''
   Clayton Yeutter, the special trade representative, said in
announcing the decision to reject a petition of rice growers and
millers that Japan's virtual ban on imported rice was indefensible
and intolerable. He said it would be vigorously challenged, but not
in the bilateral fashion demanded by U.S. rice farmers.
   Yeutter said the administration believed it would be more
effective to pursue the complaint through the 97-nation General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which currently is holding a
full-scale set of negotiations on global trade liberalization.
Agricultural trade is a central focus of the GATT negotiations.
   The GATT participants are scheduled to hold a review session in
December in Montreal to assess progress since the talks began in
1986 and to consider the way ahead.
   Yeutter told reporters he expects support from Japan at Montreal
on broad U.S. goals for liberalizing agricultural trade, including a
U.S. proposal to eliminate farm subsidies by the year 2000.
   ``If, on the other hand, representatives of the government of
Japan are not helpful and supportive in the agricultural discussions
in Montreal _ and if it becomes apparent that they are not committed
to solving the rice issue ... _ I am prepared to reconsider this
decision,'' Yeutter said.
   In that event, Yeutter said he would invite the U.S. rice
industry to refile its petition and he would ``make a decision on
the petition before the conclusion of the Reagan administration''
Jan. 20.
   In the background of Yeutter's decision were warnings from the
Japanese. A Japanese Cabinet official regarded as a spokesman for
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita on economic issues said here last
week that turning the rice issue into an unfair trade case could
trigger political reaction at home violent enough to jeopardize
promised Japanese support of further farm trade liberalization.
   Michihiko Kunihiro, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs,
said in Washington Oct. 21 he advised U.S. officials ``the reaction
would be very violent'' to an unfair trade case on rice ``in a sort
of prosecution'' by the United States.
   ``All positive thinking of agricultural people back in Japan
(would) stop, and we will have very great difficulty in pushing
forward'' to liberalization in the Uruguay round, he said.
   Rural interests have major influence in Takeshita's
Liberal-Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for more than three
decades. In September, all parties in the lower house of parliament
joined to adopt a non-binding resolution against imports of rice,
which has near-mystical significance for the populace. But the
staple costs the Japanese six to 10 times the world price of rice
because of less-efficient domestic production on small plots in the
mountainous country.
   Backers of the Sept. 14 petition of the U.S. Rice Millers
Association and the Rice Council for Market Development, had hoped
the pressure of presidential politics would force acceptance. Two of
the richest states in electoral votes, California and Texas, are
major rice growers.
   Both the Republican presidential nominee, Vice President George
Bush, and Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis had voiced support
for the rice industry's position.
   Reagan's administration rejected a similar petition in 1986
because it wanted to give Tokyo time to negotiate changes in its ban
on rice imports.
   ``We are shocked and dismayed that Ambassador Yeutter once again
would reject the U.S. rice industry's request,'' said J. Stephen
Gabbert, president of the rice millers group.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., whose district includes some of the
biggest rice farms in the nation, said the decision proved Reagan
administration officials ``are patsies when it comes to doing battle
against even blatantly illegal trade barriers.''
   Both California's senators, Democrat Alan Cranston and Republican
Pete Wilson, expressed dismay. ``This refusal by the U.S. to take
direct action under our new, tougher trade law could well serve to
reaffirm the practice of protectionism by the Japanese and resound
negatively throughout the U.S. economy,'' said Wilson.

   The two whales that captured the world's attention
off Alaska should have been eaten instead of freed from the ice, an
Eskimo activist says.
   ``In my mind, there's something wrong to save these two whales
while you are destroying the life of the human beings of the
North,'' Aqqaluk Lynge, of the Greenland office of the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference, said Friday at a news conference that
concluded a three-day meeting on arctic cooperation.
   ``To my mind it's a degradation of human values,'' he said.
   The native peoples of the Arctic region generally prefer the term
Inuit to Eskimo.
   The California gray whales, stranded in arctic ice for nearly
three weeks, apparently swam to freedom Friday, ending a
million-dollar rescue effort that involved Soviet icebreakers,
American scientists and Eskimo volunteers who cut holes in the ice
with chain saws.
   Lynge noted the enormous resources devoted to freeing the whales
and said, ``It's better to eat them.''
   The activist said environmentalists' campaigns against
fur-trapping and seal hunting in the arctic have devastated
traditional cultures in the region.
   The conference, sponsored by the government-affiliated Canadian
Institute for International Peace and Security and the
Toronto-based, private Science for Peace, brought together native
activists as well as scientists and academics on arctic issues.
   Organizers of the International Conference on Arctic Cooperation
said the participation among all arctic nations, including the
Soviet Union, was remarkable.
   Arkady Cherkasov, a specialist in arctic economics from the
Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of the USA and Canada, said
the campaign to save the two whales may have helped because of the
attention focused on the region's problems.
   ``It's a good thing,'' he said. ``But still there are many other
problems to solve in the north.''
   Cherkasov also said the Yuit people of the Soviet Arctic might be
able to join the Inuit Interpolar Conference. A representative of
the Yuits, who have traveled only rarely outside the Soviet Union,
was in Toronto for the conference.
   The interpolar conference claims to represent the 120,000 Inuit
people from Alaska, Canada and Greenland.
   But Cherkasov said Soviet participation in such a group could be
difficult because more than 25 different native groups live in the
Soviet Arctic.
   The 70 participants were from eight arctic countries, including
Canada, the Soviet Union, the United States, Denmark (Greenland),
Iceland, Sweden, Finland and Norway.
   Although they failed to agree on a final resolution, organizer
Franklyn Griffiths of the University of Toronto said the conference
produced thinking ``about what you can do up there together. Action
comes later.''
   Among the topics discussed were public health problems in the
arctic region, the results of industrialization, the environment and
the greenhouse effect, militarization and science.
   ``Each polar state now faces broadly similar problems preserving
the cultures and way of life of its indigenous peoples,'' the
conference's preliminary statement said.
   ``While the need for international civil cooperation on Arctic
environmental, scientific, social and other matters of common
concern has grown, it is constrained by military-strategic
conflict.''

   Iran offered to stop searching Iraqi-bound
ships in the Persian Gulf if Iraq agreed to a joint troop withdrawal
along the border, but Iraq did not respond and peace talks remained
deadlocked.
   ``We are ready to accept a logical interlock between the question
of (troop) withdrawal and the cessation of our right to search ships
in the gulf,'' Mohammed Ja'afar Mahallati, Iran's ambassador to the
United Nations, told reporters Friday.
   His offer came two weeks after he said Iran would ``never
relinquish its right'' to seize war cargo until a final peace treaty
was signed to end the war that began in September 1980.
   There was no immediate response from Iraq.
   During the fighting Iranian gunboats in the Persian Gulf
frequently stopped ships en route to Iraq and searched them for war
materiel, but they stopped after a U.N.-mediated cease-fire went
into effect Aug. 20.
   Disputes over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway _ Iraq's only access to
the gulf _ as well as freedom of navigation have deadlocked the
Iran-Iraq peace talks that opened Aug. 25 in Geneva, shifted to New
York in September and reconvened Monday in Geneva.
   Iraq insists the Shatt-al-Arab, which forms the southern boundary
between the two countries, be cleared of wrecked ships and silt
choking the estuary after Iran and Iraq went to war in a border
dispute.
   Iraq also has repudiated a 1975 treaty that established the
southern boundary as running down the middle of the Shatt-al-Arab
and insists the border should be along the Iranian shoreline.
   On Wednesday, Iraqi Ambassador Ismat Kittani repeated his
country's stand that the 1975 treaty must be renegotiated to
guarantee Iraq's use of the Shatt-al-Arab and Iran would have to
begin dredging the waterway. He also said Iran must guarantee Iraq's
right of free navigation in the Persian Gulf, halting the searches
of ships en route to Iraq.
   Mahallati said Iraq's goal is to abrogate the 1975 treaty to gain
control over the Shatt-al-Arab and added: ``The 1975 agreement
cannot be touched, revised, amended, modified.
   ``No Iraqi authority has ever said why we cannot begin cleaning
it (the waterway) under the 1975 treaty.''
   Kittani may have indicated a more flexible Iraqi stance Wednesday
when he said that under any Shatt-al-Arab agreement both nations
would have the right to use the passage.

<HEAD>Drexel Bond Financier Says Probe Taking Personal Toll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.'s ``junk bond'' chief who's at the center of a federal
insider-trading probe, says the nearly 2-year-old investigation has
taken a personal toll.
   ``The last 20 months have been very painful. The strain has been
enormous,'' Milken said in a rare interview published in The
Trentonian newspaper Friday.
   ``Am I operating at my fullest capacity? No. Will my life be
shorter? Possibly. I don't know how many more wrinkles there are on
my heart.''
   Drexel, Milken and three other key employees were accused Sept. 7
by the Securities and Exchange Commission of insider trading, stock
manipulation and other civil fraud charges. Criminal charges also
have been expected since federal prosecutors notified Drexel earlier
this month that it was the target of a grand jury investigation.
   The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.
   The investigation stems from disclosures by stock speculator Ivan
Boesky, who paid the SEC a record $100 million in 1986 to settle
insider trading charges and is serving a 3-year prison term for
conspiring to lie to the agency.
   Milken declined to discuss the charges in the interview,
stressing instead what he called his deep affection for his family
and extensive philanthropic activities.
   A native Californian who is considered the pioneer of the $100
billion market for high-yield securities known as junk bonds, Milken
is known for working 12-hour days, seven days a week, and reportedly
makes $40 million a year.
   But he said professional milestones pale in significance to a
son's problems with seizures and his father's bout with cancer.
   ``My first bond issue?'' he asked. ``It was less satisfying than
finding out what was wrong with (son) Greg, less satisfying than
learning Lance (another son) was chosen valedictorian.''
   A dream day, he added, ``would begin with my wife calling me to
says she's pregnant.''
   His wife, Lori _ a high school sweetheart whom Milken married at
22 _ remains fiercely proud and defensive of him.
   ``I've told (the children), `Your father is a genius and has
revolutionized the finance industry,''' she said in the interview.
   ``People don't like change, and they're trying to get rid of your
father, and if you look in your history books, you'll see that
people who have tried to make change have had this happen.''
   The Trentonian is owned by Ingersoll Publications Co., whose
chief executive, Ralph Ingersoll, is a friend of Milken's and a
Drexel client.

<TEXT>
   A man whose daughter was killed by a
lawn dart says he is relieved the Consumer Products Safety
Commission has banned the toy, but added the decision was too long
in coming.
   ``I was dealing with people who haven't buried their children,''
said David Snow, lamenting the agency's lack of urgency. ``Some
people, I guess, have a body-count mentality _ you know, `Bring me
some more dead children, we'll talk about it.'''
   The ban takes effect in December. It does not include a recall.
   ``I'm just glad it's all over with,'' Snow said Friday after the
decision was announced in Washington, D.C. ``It's been a very
intensive year-and-a-half struggle for me, but I think the right
thing has finally been done.''
   Commission Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon stressed that the one
year and one week it took to enact the rule was extraordinary speed
for the agency, which took nearly five years to issue its last
product ban, a 1981 prohibition on the sale of urea formaldehyde
foam insulation.
   Snow's 7-year-old daughter, Michelle, was killed in April 1987
when a lawn dart pierced her brain. Since her death, Snow, a
Riverside resident, has devoted himself to getting the game banned.
   Lawn darts are heavy, metal-tipped darts tossed at rings set on
grass.
   The commission made its decision as Amy Herrin, 11, whose brain
was penetrated by a dart in an accident this week, lay in a coma in
critical condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in
Nashville, Tenn.
   ``Of course, it's not going to bring my child back, or it's not
going to do any good for the little girl fighting for her life,''
Snow said. ``But still, hopefully, this'll put a stop to the carnage
that the lawn dart has caused.
   ``I'm just hopeful that those people who do have lawn darts will
throw them away.''

   The Kansas City Star and The Kansas City Times have endorsed
Michael Dukakis for president, saying the Democratic nominee will
give America a chance for ``affirmative, positive leadership.''
   In an editorial published in today's editions of The Times, the
newspaper said people have been turned off by the negative tone of
the campaign.
   ``The better chance for affirmative, positive leadership is with
Michael Dukakis,'' the Times editorial said. ``The greater peril for
a continuation of the more negative Reagan policies of neglect and
callousness rests with George Bush _ but without the Reagan ability
to inspire confidence and bring consensus.''
   Meanwhile, The Philadelphia Daily News endorsed Democrat Michael
Dukakis on Friday. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also has endorsed
Dukakis, while the Pittsburgh Press has backed Republican
presidential nominee George Bush.
   ``Michael Dukakis hasn't sold his soul,'' the Daily News said
Friday. ``He may not be exciting or visionary, but he will do better
on Central America, the defense budget, Star Wars, issues involving
human freedom ... and the Supreme Court, where appointments are
inevitable very soon. That's enough. We endorse Dukakis.''
   The newspaper added, ``We could have endorsed the 1979-80 George
Bush, the man with the courage to point out that the Reagan program
was nuts.''
   ``Not this one, not the guy who takes the lowest road possible;
who pretends, despite all the evidence, that J. Danforth Quayle is
not a callow moron; who thinks the CIA is more patriotic than the
ACLU; who is willing to play to any nasty nativist electoral strain
he can find, not the man who determines what he believes by the
polls. That man has no character.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
says his government instilled greater respect for human rights among
the armed forces, but he acknowledged Salvadorans still fear
retribution for reporting rights abuses.
   Duarte said Friday his administration has been ``totally
dedicated to converting our military officers into faithful
supporters of the fundamental rights of the Salvadoran people.''
   But El Salvador lacked the technical ability to investigate
thoroughly the activities of death squads and abuses of authority by
security forces, the president said at a meeting of government
rights officials from Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.
   Witnesses are afraid to talk, Duarte acknowledged. He called El
Salvador a country where ``the people have kept quiet out of fear,
where they are afraid they will be killed if they create problems.''
   Duarte, 62, is suffering from liver cancer and returned Oct. 16
from a weeklong stay in Washington, where he received chemotherapy
treatment. Doctors in June gave him up to 18 months to live.
   Duarte said his administration's rights record was all the more
notable because the government is mired in a 9-year civil war
against leftist guerrillas.
   ``We have made great advances in the promotion, the protection
and the state of human rights despite the limitations our
challengers impose upon us day after day and the merciless attack of
subversive forces and international terrorism,'' said Duarte, who
was elected in 1984.
   Earlier this week, the London-based Amnesty International human
rights organization said hundreds of suspected government opponents
were slain in the past two years by death squads that usually
include members of police or military units.
   Duarte's government has not prosecuted anyone for suspected
death-squad activity.
   A federal judge did issue arrest warrants for four soldiers
following the killings of 10 villagers in September, but no arrests
have been made.
   Witnesses said soldiers killed seven men and three women in the
village of Aldea, 31 miles east of the capital, after accusing them
of collaborating with the rebels.
   The armed forces first said the victims were rebels and later
claimed they were killed by the guerrillas.
   The arrest warrants were issued following an investigation by the
attorney general.
   An estimated 65,000 people have been killed in the civil war. The
majority of the victims were civilians.

   A leading Soviet poet, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, says
he hopes his upcoming visit to Israel will bring the Soviets and
Israelis closer.
   ``There are so many tragedies, so many losses which unite us,''
Yevtushenko said Friday on Israel radio. ``The blood we lost
struggling against fascism together unites us forever.''
   The 55-year-old poet, now a spokesman for the Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, was interviewed in Rome. Yevtushenko will visit
the Jewish state for the first time in December.
   ``I'm going to your country without any glasses on my eyes, pink
glasses or ... black glasses. I'm going with my own eyes. I would
like to be part of a bridge between our cultures and our people,''
he said in fluent English.
   The poetry of Yevtushenko, a descendant of Ukrainian exiles in
Siberia, has been widely translated into Hebrew since the 1960s,
when he wrote the ``Babi Yar'' poem about the Nazi massacre of Jews
near the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.
   Yevtushenko credited himself and the post-Stalin generation of
Soviet poets with envisaging the ideas of restructuring and greater
openness in the Soviet society, now advocated by Gorbachev.
   ``Gorbachev was ... one of my audience, one of audience of poets
of my generation. I can say very proudly that poets of my generation
formed ideas of glasnost and perestroika,'' Yevtushenko said.
   He joins other Soviet artists who have recently been permitted to
visit Israel. The Soviet Union broke diplomatic ties with Israel
following the 1967 Middle East war, but relations have warmed the
last two years.
   In 1987, the Soviet Union dispatched a diplomatic delegation to
the Jewish state. A similar Israeli group has been in Moscow since
July.
   Soviet authorities allowed about 12,000 Jews to emigrate this
year, up from the 8,700 allowed to leave in 1987, and granted the
estimated 2.5 million Jews living in the Soviet Union some cultural
freedom.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Renews Attack On Recent Architecture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AUDREY WOODS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles likened modern British architecture
to the blandness of nuclear reactors and computers, saying a city is
lucky today if it ``doesn't have its heart torn out and thrown
away.''
   In a Friday night television program that he wrote and presented,
the 39-year-old heir to the British throne said developers should
listen to ordinary people and what they want when rebuilding inner
cities.
   Charles, who has no formal training in architecture, said in the
British Broadcasting Corp. program that Britain was in the middle of
another building boom and the important question was ``whether we
can get it right this time, with this second chance.''
   His impassioned argument was a return to the theme he took up
last December when he stirred national controversy by saying
architects, planners and developers had done more damage to London's
skyline than had German bombings in World War II.
   On a boat trip down the River Thames, the prince said the
concrete National Theater ``seems like a clever way of building a
nuclear power station in the middle of London.''
   Looking at a low-slung, stark-white block among the Victorian
buildings at the edge of the Thames, Charles said: ``That's redolent
of a word processor.''
   ``Could you imagine the French doing that sort of thing in Paris,
on the banks of the Seine, around Notre Dame?'' asked Charles, ``or
the Venetians building tower blocks next to San Marco?''
   His comments drew mixed reaction.
   Legislator Ron Brown of the socialist opposition Labor Party said
Charles ``speaks basic good sense.''
   Max Hutchinson, president-elect of the Royal Institute of British
Architects, said Charles ``has chosen to criticize architects and
architects alone.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly 11,000 pounds of pure cocaine
that army troops discovered in a northern Mexico cave was destined
for the United States, a military official said.
   Mexican army Col. Salvador Bejaralo Gomez said Friday that the
troops were on a training mission in the rugged Sierra Madre
mountains when they found the cocaine.
   Bejaralo said the cache was found inside large canvas bags
Thursday near San Buenaventura, about 120 miles north of Chihuahua,
the capital of Chihuahua state.
   The Excelsior news service Friday quoted a federal police
commander as saying the drug was worth about $3 billion.
   There were no arrests.
   Javier Contreras, editorial director of the newspaper Novedades
de Chihuahua, said military officials suspected Colombia's Medellin
cocaine cartel ferried the drug to Mexico and planned to smuggle it
across the U.S. border.
   Authorities detected three ``suspicious'' airplane flights to the
remote area in recent weeks, Contreras said. In September, army
troops destroyed a clandestine airstrip 5 miles from the cave, he
said.
   Bejaralo said the drug was taken to the army base in Chihuahua
and will be destroyed next week.
   The Excelsior report called the seizure the largest ever in
Mexico.
   The largest cocaine haul ever is 22,000 pounds authorities seized
in Colombia on March 10, 1984.

<TEXT>
   The outcome of the two-week effort to free
two California gray whales may never be known as the massive mammals
faced 200 miles of ice-clogged waters on the way to their winter
home.
   Indeed, the sentiment among rescuers Friday was that ignorance
would be bliss if the whales died soon after more than $1 million
and countless hours of labor were spent trying to save them.
   ``A lot of people just didn't want to know'' about their fate,
said federal marine mammal biologist Jim Harvey.
   Rescuers decided against affixing radio transmitters to the
animals. That entailed additional expense, and rescue coordinator
Ron Morris said little scientific knowledge could be gained from
tracking a pair of young, lost whales.
   But hopes were high they would survive. ``They had the will to
live. They should make it,'' Morris said.
   The whales on Friday reluctantly took advantage of an escape
route from Alaska's ice-bound northern coast afforded them by an
alliance of groups that are often at odds with each other: Eskimo
whalers, the military, the oil industry, environmentalists, the
Soviet Union and the North Slope Borough, a countylike government.
   The Soviet icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev made four runs late
Thursday through the last 300 yards of ice between open water and
the manmade breathing holes where the whales were resting when
darkness fell.
   On its final run during the night, the Arseniev reported that one
whale entered the channel the ship had left in its wake.
   But when Eskimos checked on the whales Friday morning, they still
were in the last breathing hole. The Eskimos were prepared to resume
leading the whales to open water by cutting more holes with chain
saws.
   Then the whales disappeared.
   ``They were looking good,'' North Slope Borough Mayor George
Ahmaogak said after the last sighting of the animals.
   It was several hours after dawn Friday before rescuers could take
to the air to confirm the whales were gone. No trace of them was
found, which was interpreted favorably.
   Morris said he believed the whales were on their way, saying
there was at least three miles of open water in the direction they
had to go to resume their annual migration to Baja California.
   Originally, three whales were found trapped by an early freeze.
They were discovered Oct. 13 after being stuck in the ice off Point
Barrow about a week. One disappeared Oct. 21 nearly five miles from
open water and is presumed dead.
   The surviving whales, named Crossbeak and Bonnet by rescuers,
were bleeding from cuts and abrasions late Thursday.
   Questions were raised about the whales' apparent dependence on
man's help and their attraction to the noise of the chain saws. But
Harvey said he expected the whales to revert quickly to their
natural behavior.
   Gray whales generally migrate within sight of land, usually no
more than three miles offshore, Harvey said.
   Gary Hufford of the National Weather Service said that might
present a problem, since the ice near shore was more solid than the
ice farther out.
   ``It's going to force them out,'' Hufford said. ``What that's
going to do to them, we don't know.''
   Because the whales no longer can rely on the regularly spaced
breathing holes provided by the Eskimos, they would have to be
willing to search out random openings in the unstructured and
constantly changing ice ahead of them, Hufford added.
   With the population of California gray whales estimated at more
than 20,000 and growing, marine mammal experts here said there is no
scientific reason for special efforts to save the whales, even
though they are considered endangered.
   David Withrow, a whale specialist from the government's Marine
Mammal Laboratory, said the species may actually be better off
without these two whales because they were not clever enough to
migrate in the right direction at the right time.
   In the time that United States' northernmost community became the
focus of worldwide attention, native craftsmen geared up to meet the
demand for souvenirs. The whale saga also spawned a T-shirt
industry, with at least three commemorative logos marketed.

   A second person who ate poisonous mushrooms
at a dinner party underwent a liver transplant operation Friday, and
another person was awaiting a donor.
   A woman who also ate the mushrooms received a liver transplant
Thursday, and the fifth victim was being watched for signs of liver
damage.
   All five people ate the so-called ``death cap'' mushrooms in an
Oriental stir fry dish served Saturday at the home of Teresa and
John Duncan.
   The mushrooms were Amanita phalloides, a deadly variety common in
Europe but found only recently in the western United States, said
Preston Alexander, president of the Oregon Mycological Society.
   The people at the dinner party ate a total of at least 10
mushrooms when less than one can be fatal, Alexander said.
   Some members of the dinner party picked the mushrooms while
searching for chestnuts, he said.
   Isun Pak, 52, of Hillsboro, underwent the operation Friday at
Oregon Health Sciences University. Doctors said there were no
complications.
   Friday night, Andy Clark, 33, of Hillsboro became the third
victim to undergo transplant surgery. The operation at the
University of California-San Francisco Medical Center began about
five hours after Pak's surgery was completed.
   A donor organ was being sought for Mrs. Duncan, 43, of Portland,
who was at the Portland hospital.
   Glenda Sabolyk was in critical but stable condition at the
California hospital, where she received a donor organ on Thursday.
   And Duncan was in serious condition at Bess Kaiser Hospital in
Portland, where doctors were watching him for signs of liver damage.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of public
employees have rejected a presidential order and an appeal by
lawmakers to end a nationwide strike that has paralyzed government
operations and shut down hospitals and schools.
   The army remained on a state of alert today, guarding government
facilities nationwide.
   The 60,000-member Public Employees Association of Honduras vowed
to continue the strike until the government agreed to provide better
pay and benefits.
   ``At least 90 percent of government of offices are closed,
including hospitals and schools,'' association president Carlos
Obdulio Chevez said Friday.
   The Honduran Congress on Friday asked the strikers to return to
work while it looked for money to meet their demands. Lawmaker Oscar
Melara said Congress needed time to assess ``Honduras' economic
situation ... and time to find the proper solution'' to the labor
strife.
   Carlos Montoya, president of Congress, said acceeding to the
strikers' demands ``could produce a (currency) devaluation and a
rise in inflation that could seriously damage Honduras' economic
future.''
   On Thursday, President Jose Azcona Hoyo declared the first-ever
nationwide walkout by government employees illegal and ordered them
back to work.
   But the public employees rejected the order. They are seeking
paid vacations, an extra month's pay every year, job security and
Christmas bonuses.
   When Azcona offered them job security and paid vacations, Montoya
said the president was promising something he couldn't deliver.
   Other unions also have gone on strike in a show of solidarity
with the government employees.
   Public employees in this nation of 5 million people earn an
average of $500 a month. Minimum wage is $105 a month in urban areas
and $80 in rural areas.

<HEAD>Air Force Chief Discloses Extensive Redesign Of Stealth Bomber</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1 billion redesign that improved the B-2
Stealth bomber was possible because the procurement of the
controversial B-1B bomber bought designers the time they needed, the
Air Force chief of staff says.
   Gen. Larry D. Welch described the redesign, which makes the
Stealth bomber less visible on radar and a stronger offensive threat
at low altitudes, as a ``brilliant effort'' by Northrop Corp.
engineers.
   ``The redesign effort was a marvelous thing to be able to do,
because we had the time to do it,'' he said Friday in a meeting with
reporters at a national symposium of the Air Force Association.
   Such a redesign would have been impossible if the Pentagon had
not acquired the controversial B-1B, allowing those involved on the
Stealth bomber project a margin of comfort in developing the best
possible design for the B-2, Welch said.
   ``If we hadn't had the B-1, we would have felt an intense
pressure to accelerate (development) on the B-2 and I think that
would have been a disaster,'' Welch said.'
   Originally, the B-2 was designed to penetrate enemy airspace at
high altitudes, Welch said. But the $1 billion redesign, financed by
the Air Force, makes the plane strong enough to penetrate enemy
defenses at low altitudes, where there is more air turbulence, he
said.
   The overhaul, which was a computer-aided design, was accomplished
before any aircraft were constructed. The modifications also reduced
the bomber's visibility to radar and will extend the aircraft's
life, Welch said.
   The first public display of the bomber is scheduled for Nov. 22
at Palmdale, Calif., where the bomber is being assembled under tight
security.
   Welch defended the Air Force acquisition of the B-1B bomber,
saying that it gave the United States the benefit of added nuclear
deterrence while the Stealth bomber was developed.
   Some congressmen have criticized the B-1B for being unable to
perform initially at the full range of specifications set for it.
Most of the controversy focused on the bomber's equipment designed
to fool hostile air defenses. The Air Force calls the B-1B the most
sophisticated and capable bomber flying.
   The Stealth bomber has been described as a ``flying wing,''
reminiscent of the YB-49 bomber developed in the 1940s. That bomber
was never put into production because the Air Force opted to build
more conventional aircraft.
   The B-2 design involved a revival of the flying wing-type
aircraft, which lacks a traditional fuselage. Welch said the key to
the redesign was finding the best type of wing to build.
   The most recent Air Force cost estimate to build the 132 bombers
requested has been ``around $37 billion,'' Welch said, but he
quickly added, ``That's wrong.'' He said that amount did not take
into account the approximately $1 billion used in the redesign
effort and other costs.
   A new and presumably higher cost estimate will be submitted to
Congress soon and should be unclassified for the public soon after
that, Welch said. A recent General Accounting Office study said the
bomber fleet could cost more than $68 billion.

   The scheduled liftoff of the first unmanned flight
of the Soviet space shuttle Buran, a gleaming white spacecraft
developed with the help of the Soviet military, has been delayed
indefinitely, Tass said today.
   The official Soviet news agency said the 3:23 a.m. EDT scheduled
blast-off of the Buran, Snowstorm in Russian, from the Baikonur
launch site on the Central Asian steppe in Kazakhstan had been
delayed for a second time, four hours after its intended liftoff.
   Tass said information of the indefinite launch delay came from
``competent sources'' at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where the shuttle
was poised for liftoff. It gave no reason for the delay and provided
no further details.
   The Buran was to make two orbits and return to a concrete landing
strip eight miles from the launch site. Reports indicated the
initial flight would be devoted entirely to checking out the craft
and would not be used to deploy satellites or conduct any other
missions.

   Now they're touting the king for president.
   Two songwriters from this village are promoting the late Elvis
Presley, often called the king of rock 'n' roll, for the nation's
top political office, maintaining in their lyrics that no one can
``rock us'' like Elvis.
   Randel Porter and Mark Hancock have written and recorded the
song, even though Presley died in 1977. Of course, some fans
maintain he may have staged his death and may be alive.
   The professional songwriters recorded the song ``Elvis Presley
for President'' in Cleveland and released it earlier this month.
   According to the lyrics: ``He ain't no politician. He's only a
musician. But I think he ought to run. 'Cause Bush could never rock
us. Neither could Dukakis.''
   Porter and Hancock had been writing love songs. But they said
they recently decided to release satirical songs involving social
and political issues.
   Since the timeliness of ``Elvis Presley for President'' is
limited, the pair are also promoting the flip side of the single,
``It Came From West Covina,'' a science-fiction love song.

   Richard Oyer keeps getting words that
multiply out to be a million _ but he has far from a million of them.
   Oyer, a junior high school teacher here, got national publicity
when he assigned his mathematics students the task of finding such
words. In the assignment, letters in each word are given a numerical
value and had to be multiplied to equal 1 million.
   For example, the letter A has a value of one, B a value of two,
and so on.
   Oyer said at the time he assigned the project that he knew of at
least two words that multiplied to 1 million. Students Patrick
Sawhill and Allen Schneider figured out the first one as ``typey,''
an adjective that means to embody the ideal characteristics of its
type or breed.
   Sawhill came up with the second one that Oyer knew of _
``teaette,'' a noun meaning tea maker. Oyer checked the words in
Webster's Third International Dictionary.
   Since then, another student, Jeremy Yoder, uncovered
``beddy-bye,'' meaning bedtime in baby talk.
   Oyer said he's received a letter from a Des Moines woman that
includes two more million-dollar words.

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swarms of locusts carried across the
Atlantic by tropical storms have landed on this Caribbean island and
begun a ``feeding frenzy,'' experts say.
   Rene Colon, director of plant sanitation for the commonwealth's
Agriculture Department, said it was the first time locusts have been
seen in Puerto Rico. The insects were first discovered in at least
12 Caribbean nations last week.
   ``These are flying eating machines which can easily outrun
humans,'' Colon said Friday. ``They are on a feeding frenzy and they
destroy anything green in their path.''
   Locusts are migratory grasshoppers that travel in hordes,
stripping vast areas of vegetation. Officials said the locusts,
about three inches long with pinkish legs, pose no threat to humans.
   Colon said the locusts were spotted in Puerto Rico this week by
children who thought they were praying mantises.
   Since last week, the locusts have been devouring vegetation in
the Caribbean islands of Barbados, Jamaica, St. Vincent, St. Lucia,
Dominica, Martinique, Antigua, Barbuda and the Grenadines. They have
also been sighted as far south as Guyana and Suriname in South
America.
   Experts say the locusts were blown thousands of miles from Africa
by Hurricane Gilbert last month and by Hurricane Joan this month.
   ``They're exhausted from coasting with these storms and they're
starving,'' said Colon.
   He said agriculture officials are spraying pesticides but weren't
having much success because ``in seconds they can hop 200 meters
(660 feet) _ these are flying insects.''
   Specialists from the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization have been island-hopping around the Caribbean to help
local authorities eradicate the locusts. They say the situation is
mostly under control.
   FAO specialist Phil Symmons said pesticide sprays as well as
blackbirds and other predators have controlled the locust invasion
in most islands but that it was feared the insects left eggs. He
recommended that spraying continue.
   Officials said damage estimates and crop losses were still being
evaluated. Sugarcane, corn and bananas comprise most of the crops
grown in these nations.
   Colon said locusts ravaged one farmer's cornfield in Aibonito, in
central Puerto Rico, about 25 miles from the capital of San Juan.
   He said the Agriculture Department ruled out using planes to
spray fields because ``it would cost us millions.''
   ``We are just hoping native birds will eat them or that they will
go away. If they appeared, they can also disappear,'' he said.
   He said the insects were also sighted at Roosevelt Roads U.S.
naval base on the eastern end of Puerto Rico and in Old San Juan,
the historical Spanish colonial sector of town and a major tourist
attraction.
   The Agriculture Ministry in Guyana said on Friday that spraying
will continue over the weekend, but so far the locusts have mainly
eaten grass.
   Other Caribbean islands were also continuing their spraying
campaigns.

<TEXT>
   Police are trying to calm townspeople as
they search for a murder suspect with an apparent taste for
``strictly gore'' movies, and authorities promised extra Halloween
patrols if he remains at large.
   Many residents in the western Massachusetts town of 11,000 people
said they would forbid their children from trick-or-treating if
police haven't arrested the suspect, Mark Branch, 18.
   Branch is wanted in connection with the slaying of Sharon
Gregory, a 19-year-old freshman at Greenfield Community College,
whose body was found Monday in the bathroom of her family's home by
her twin sister. Police said she had been stabbed repeatedly.
   Using dogs and helicopters, police searched for Branch for the
third day Friday in woods in the nearby town of Buckland.
Authorities issued a warrant for Branch's arrest Tuesday after his
car was found abandoned in that town.
   State police Sgt. Norm Roberts urged residents Friday to ignore
unfounded rumors of a second slaying, but he asked them to be
careful because the suspect may be armed and dangerous.
   ``It has thrown panic into a lot of people,'' he said of the
rumors.
   A video store owner described Branch as an enthusiast of bloody
horror films, particularly the ``Friday the 13th'' series that
features a character who slashes his victims.
   Bob Quesnel of Video Expo 1 in Greenfield said Branch has rented
and purchased hundreds of horror videos from his store. ``He rented
strictly gore, period,'' he said. ``The gorier, the better.''
   The community college canceled a Halloween dance because of
Gregory's death.
   Gary Sibilia, chief of nearby Ashfield police, said he is
considering calling off the town's Halloween parade Monday if Branch
is not found.
   State police said the search has been made more difficult by a
growing nervousness in the community and repeated rumors of other
stabbings.
   Greenfield Police Capt. Joseph LaChance said the department's
five lines ``have been lit perpetually'' with inquiries about the
rumors.
   Police said they were maintaining a round-the-clock patrol and
checking out numerous reports of sightings. But they said there was
no sign that Branch was in the area.
   ``There are thousands of camps and shacks out in the woods,''
said Greenfield Police Chief David McCarthy, noting that Branch
could be moving ``from camp to camp, or he could be a thousand miles
away.''
   Gregory was the third woman murdered in the town in the past two
years.
   Greenfield High School helped its students cope with Gregory's
murder by offering counseling, said Vice Principal Ann McKenna.
   ``Everyone still, including myself, is quite upset.'' McKenna
said. ``A lot of people knew Sharon. She only graduated last June.''

   A major conference on gay studies is
drawing scholars and gay-rights leaders nationwide to Yale
University this weekend to discuss topics ranging from homosexuality
in Japanese girls' comics to housework in gay and lesbian families.
   More than 500 people are expected, up from about 300 last year,
organizers said.
   The conference is the second to be sponsored by the 2-year-old
Lesbian & Gay Studies Center at Yale, an organization of faculty,
staff and students devoted to promoting research bearing on the
lives and history of gay people.
   Among the topics to be explored are ``Art and the Gay Search for
Self,'' ``Gays and the Mass Media,'' ``Homosexuality as Part of
Religious Life,'' and ``Psychological Perspectives on the AIDS
Epidemic.''
   Interest in last year's conference proved strong enough to expand
this year's program, with 21 panel sessions scheduled for today and
Sunday.
   ``People are thrilled, absolutely thrilled. It gives them a very
august forum to discuss what it means to be a gay or lesbian in this
world,'' said Brian Wescott, a Yale graduate student and member of
the Lesbian & Gay Studies Center.
   Having the conference at Yale, which helped publicize the event,
``helps confer on it an authority it might not otherwise have,'' he
said.
   Last year's inaugural conference drew widespread publicity
because it fell within weeks of Yale President Benno C. Schmidt's
strong criticism of a Wall Street Journal essay that said Yale had
developed the reputation of being ``a gay school.''
   The conference is bringing together more than 100 scholars,
artists, gay politicians and political activists from around the
country.
   In a panel discussion tonight, Jean O'Leary, the first avowed
lesbian appointed to the Democratic National Committee, was to
discuss her experiences in politics.
   In seeking new ways to encourage scholarship on homosexual
issues, organizers decided to have at least one session feature
research by undergraduates.
   Yale senior Kristine Franklin's topic is ``Gender Roles, Power
Relations and Housework in Gay and Lesbian Families.'' She studied
12 gay and 12 lesbian families to find out, among other things, who
did the housework when traditional gender roles were not involved.
   She found that ``those with less power did more housework.''
   Scholarship on homosexuality was growing even before the
conferences were arranged at Yale, said Ralph Hexter, an associate
professor of classics at Yale and one of the organizers.
   What the conference does, he said, ``is provide a forum to find
out what other people are doing.''
   The Whitney Humanities Center at Yale has contributed $1,000 to
the $12,000 cost of the conference. Because the conference is free
to participants, the remainder of the costs will have to be covered
through donations, Wescott said.

<HEAD>Fernald Residents Complain On `Donahue' About Nuke Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Residents near a uranium processing plant
that spilled radioactive dust into the environment complained on
television of birth defects and cancer and demanded the plant be
cleaned up.
   The Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald has been widely
criticized since the U.S. Department of Energy admitted in January
1985 that at least 200,000 pounds of uranium oxide dust has been
released into the atmosphere from the plant during its 37 years of
operation.
   DOE officials said last week they had no plans to close the plant
and have begun a 10-year, $500 million program to clean up and
modernize it.
   ``I don't see why we should have to wait for more studies, we
should just make them stop,'' said an unidentified woman who drew
applause from the audience during the live ``Donahue'' show Friday.
   Many said cancer has afflicted members of their families who live
near the plant. Others in the town 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati
complained their property values have dropped.
   Host Phil Donahue invited Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste and Sen.
John Glenn, D-Ohio, to answer questions in the packed 660-seat
auditorium of Hamilton High School. Hamilton is about two miles from
Fernald.
   There were no representatives from the DOE, which owns the
1,000-acre plant, or Westinghouse Materials of Ohio, which operates
it under contract.
   ``They weren't ducking the show,'' said producer Marlene Sulip.
``They weren't invited. But we sent them 60 tickets, which they
accepted.''
   Dr. Richard Luftic, a professor of special education at Miami
University of Ohio, said there is a high incidence of cancer and
spina bifida reported among children in the area. Babies with spina
bifida are born with unclosed spines.
   ``Usually, you find spina bifida once in a million births. There
are two of them down there next door to each other,'' said Luftin.
   Stanley Chesley, a Cincinnati lawyer representing 14,000
residents who filed a $300 million class action lawsuit against the
former plant operator, NLO, said he expects to win and the Energy
Department to pay the damages. NLO formerly was known as National
Lead of Ohio.
   ``If we get a judgment, there is a clause in NLO's contract that
says DOE has to pay. The families of the seven astronauts who died
in the space (shuttle) crash received fair payment. I think these
people are entitled to fair payment.''
   Celeste and Glenn agreed that Fernald should be inspected by an
independent commission of experts. ``The secrecy of the DOE has
created this mess. They can't be trusted to do the job,'' Glenn said.
   Glenn called on the Reagan administration to budget at least $5
billion a year to clean up 15 nuclear processing sites in the United
States.
   About 200 Fernald neighbors turned out Thursday night at a church
in Ross, where U.S. Rep. Thomas Luken accused the DOE of lying and
misleading the public about safety.
   He noted DOE admissions in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati last
week that there were no safe levels of uranium radiation. The
admissions were made in response to the residents' class action suit.
   The DOE previously contended that there were safe levels of
radiation for plant workers. But in its court filing, the department
admitted that all exposure to uranium is dangerous.
   Radioactivity is measured in rem units. The maximum acceptable
level of exposure for government workers is 5 rems a year, according
to guidelines of the National Council on Radiation. Five rems is
equal to about 200 chest X-rays.
   Westinghouse Materials says no worker received more than 1.2 rems
exposure at the plant.
   DOE, which is defending NLO, says the company is not liable
because all the problems with the plant were the result of DOE
orders.
   The department says it can't be sued because it has sovereign
immunity, and that NLO is protected as the department's contractor.

   The government today welcomed Washington's
announcement that it will not investigate Japanese restrictions on
rice imports but said they could not accept the demand that Japan
begin opening up its rice market.
   Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato said Japan is willing to
discuss rice along with other agricultural issues as part of current
world trade negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round.
   But he said he regretted U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter's warning Friday that he will reconsider an investigation
into Japanese rice barriers if Japan does not demonstrate
willingness to open its market to U.S. farm products in trade talks
in December.
   Japanese officials maintain that rice, as a staple food, should
be protected and the country should continue its self-sufficiency in
the grain for security reasons.
   ``Our position is that the rice issue is not a subject for
bilateral negotiations,'' Sato told reporters.
   Sato said Japan is willing to discuss rice at the Uruguay Round,
but if the the United States singles out Japan with conditions, ``it
will be difficult for us to respond.''
   In his announcement, Yeutter rejected a request from the U.S.
rice industry for a federal investigation into Japanese rice
barriers. The petition was the first major test of a clause in the
new U.S. Omnibus Trade Act, which makes it harder to avoid acting on
petitions alleging unfair foreign trade practices.
   The Japanese government regulates the domestic rice market,
buying much of the rice produced by Japanese farmers and reselling
it to consumers at lower prices.
   Agricultural officials have said Japanese restrictions on rice
imports should not be singled out when many other countries,
including the United States, maintain barriers on farm products.
   In the world trade talks, held under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Geneva-based, Japan has called for
each country to be allowed to restrict imports of certain basic
foodstuffs.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega has accused the
United States of ordering thousands of rebels to re-enter Nicaragua
and sabotage reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane
Joan.
   Meanwhile, it was reported today that some U.S. charities trying
provide humanitarian relief to Nicaraguans hurt by the hurricane
claim they are being hampering in their efforts by the Reagan
administration.
   ``Taking advantage of the damage, the trauma, the Yankees have
already ordered the infiltration of 3,000 mercenaries into
Nicaraguan territory,'' Ortega said Friday in a nationwide radio and
television address.
   In Washington, State Department press officer Anita Stockman
denied the allegations. ``No U.S. military aid is being provided to
the Contras at this time,'' she said, referring to the rebels.
   Rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros said in Washington that the
Contras were receiving only U.S. humanitarian aid.
   ``The fact is Mr. Ortega is trying to conceal the continuous
buildup they have carried out with the help of Cuba and the Soviet
Union,'' Matamoros said.
   Ortega said the Reagan administration had re-armed the rebels,
known as Contras, and instructed them to ``sabotage and slow
reconstruction work and delay the coffee harvest,'' economically
vital to Nicaragua's already staggering economy.
   ``Facing a threat such as this when we are facing the
consequences of this hurricane, Nicaraguans are obliged to mobilize,
organize, to fulfill the job of defending the country,'' Ortega said.
   Some private U.S. organizations complained the Reagan
administration has refused to assist their efforts to deliver
donated goods to Nicaragua and has even threatened to declare
shipments of construction supplies illegal under the U.S. economic
embargo of the country.
   ``It's kind of appalling that the White House and the State
Department are interfering in the process of disaster aid,'' Richard
M. Walden, president of Operation California, a Los Angeles-based
relief group organizing an airlift to Nicaragua next week, was
quoted as saying today in the Los Angeles Times.
   White House and State Department officials denied any deliberate
effort to block private aid, but they acknowledged the
administration has taken few steps to assist the charities, the
Times said.
   The Soviet-backed Sandinista government and the U.S.-supported
Contras agreed in March to halt offensive operations in their 7-year
civil war. The government unilaterally has extended the truce on a
month-to-month basis. The current extension ends Monday.
   Ortega offered no proof of his allegations and did not say that
mobilization meant the government was allowing the cease-fire to
lapse.
   Most of the Contras retreated to base camps in Honduras after the
U.S. Congress refused to renew arms aid. Legislation approved by
Congress does allow delivery of food, shelter, clothing and medical
services to the rebels.
   The leftist government frequently has compared the effort to
survive last week's killer hurricane to its struggle against the
Contras. On Friday, Ortega repeated his assertion that an end to
Contra aid would be the best hurricane assistance the United States
could offer.
   Citing the latest government data, Ortega said Hurricane Joan
left 103 dead and 186,950 homeless. Previous government figures
estimated the number of dead at more than 60, with about 300,000
homeless.
   Ortega said 110 people were missing, an additional 178 were
seriously hurt and 324,861 were evacuated from their homes; 29,152
homes were destroyed; 33 bridges were destroyed and 33 others
damaged, and 400 miles of roads suffered direct damage.
   The cattle and fishing industries, and rice, cotton, grain,
sugar, cacao and African palm crops suffered serious damage and
``unmeasurable'' ecological damage was done, Ortega said.
   The storm ripped across 200 miles of Nicaraguan territory from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.
   ``The data indicate we met our main goal, to save lives,'' Ortega
said.
   He thanked Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Britain and the European
Economic Community for their aid and said East Germany and the
Soviet Union also promised help.
   The president called the aid ``necessary and urgent.''

   Imelda Marcos says she invited federal officials
on her flight to New York today to prove she would not flee the
United States to avoid federal racketeering charges.
   ``There are rumors that once airborne and out of radar range, I
might flee out of the United States,'' Mrs. Marcos said in a
statement released late Friday. ``In order to assure everybody of
our destination, I am inviting the FBI, Federal Aviation
Administration and the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service)
to have their men accompany us in the plane.
   ``In addition, I wish to state that since we were brought here,
we expect to be brought back to our country as our human right to
dignity.''
   U.S. Attorney Dan Bent said no federal officials would escort the
Philippines' former first lady on the private jet that tobacco
heiress Doris Duke loaned for the 5,000-mile trip
   Mrs. Marcos and her husband, former Philippines President
Ferdinand Marcos, were indicted Oct. 21 on charges accusing them of
looting more than $100 million from the Philippines and using it to
buy New York real estate, artwork and other objects. They were to be
arraigned Monday in Manhattan.
   Defense lawyers persuaded U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan that
Marcos, 71, was too frail to make the long flight for the simple
legal proceeding, which consists of entering a plea. His arraignment
has been postponed at least until a government physician examines
him.
   But Keenan ruled Mrs. Marcos, 59, was fit to make the trip.
   Defense lawyers said she would plead innocent.
   As Mrs. Marcos prepared for her first trip out of Hawaii since
being exiled here nearly three years ago, aides struggled to
maintain the secrecy of her departure time and itinerary.
   ``I really don't know what time she's leaving. For security
reasons, they're not saying anything until right before she goes,''
said spokesman Gemmo Trinidad, who released her statement.
   Government officials said they expected Mrs. Marcos and her
entourage to depart in Mrs. Duke's Boeing 737-300 19-passenger
luxury jet before 6 p.m. EDT; stop in San Francisco to visit her
daughter, Irene Araneta and to pick up lawyer John Bartko; and
continue to Manhattan.
   Suites have been booked at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for the
Marcos entourage, which includes a nurse, secretary, lawyers and
several friends, Trinidad said.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii in February 1986 after a military-civilian
revolt catapulted Corazon Aquino to power, ending Marcos' 20-year
rule.
   Although Trinidad and other Marcos aides refused to detail Mrs.
Marcos' social plans in New York, another associate said she planned
to shop and entertain old friends at the Waldorf-Astoria.
   In a related development, federal agents obtained an arrest
warrant for Saudian Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi, according to
the Los Angeles Times.
   Khashoggi was indicted last week on racketeering charges along
with the Marcoses. He is accused of acting as a front for Marcos to
help divert assets and hide Marcos' ownership of real estate and art.
   Robert Morvillo, a lawyer for the financier, said Friday that
Khashoggi hadn't made up his mind whether to appear voluntarily in
the United States to face the charges. No court date for his
appearance was scheduled.

   Light snow showers stretched today from northern Minnesota across
parts of lower Michigan, while thunderstorms drenched southern Texas.
   More than an inch of rain fell at Laredo, Texas, during a
two-hour period, causing street flooding and power outages.
   Patches of dense fog developed Friday night and by midnight, fog
was scattered over the southern half of the Atlantic states, from
Kentucky across the central Gulf of Mexico states, and over the
lower Mississippi Valley.
   There were no reports of measurable snowfall during the six hours

   The nation's high temperature Friday was 93 degrees at Bullhead
City, Ariz., El Centro, Calif., and Presidio, Texas.
   The temperature at the Duluth, Minn., airport dipped to 15
degrees and tied the low temperature record for the date, which was
set in 1980.
   Today's forecast called for showers and a few thunderstorms from
northern Florida and southern Georgia across the central Gulf Coast
into southern Texas; snow showers from upper Michigan and northern
lower Michigan to western New York state; and snow showers in
northern Maine. Generally sunny skies were forecast for the
remainder of the nation.
   High temperatures were to be in the 50s or 60s across much of the

<HEAD>American Photographer, Convicted Of Trafficking, To Be Transferred
To U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it will hand over an
American free-lance photographer convicted of cocaine trafficking to
U.S. authorities for transfer to a prison in the United States.
   The decision in the case of Conan D. Owen, 23, a former intern in
the office of Vice President George Bush and whose imprisonment drew
the attention of then-U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, was
announced Friday by the Spanish cabinet.
   A government spokesman said a prisoner exchange agreement between
Spain and the United States permits the transfer of Owen, who was
arrested in March 1987 when customs agents found four pounds of
cocaine in his luggage.
   It was not known when Owen, of Annandale, Va., will leave his
Barcelona jail, where he is serving a six-year term.
   ``It's normally a fast process,'' said Helga Soto, a spokeswoman
for the Spanish Embassy in Washington.
   ``It means he's going to come home,'' said a relieved Ernest
Owen, Owen's father. ``That's the first thing. And we're extremely
happy about that after so many false starts and false hopes.''
   Once in the United States, U.S. Justice Department officials
could decide to grant Owen immediate parole.
   ``It's not clear at this time how long or where he would have to
serve the remainder of his sentence,'' said Justice Department
spokesman John Russell in Washington. ``In keeping with our policy,
he will probably be incarcerated in a federal institution, and we
will try to have him incarcerated as close to his home as possible.''
   Owen, who worked in Bush's office in 1984, was arrested March 13,
1987, at Barcelona's El Prat airport. Customs agents found the
high-grade cocaine in a false-bottomed suitcase he checked through
on a flight from Santiago, Chile, to Barcelona.
   Owen, who spent more than a year in Barcelona's 85-year-old Model
Prison before his trial last March, told the court he had been
conned into taking the suitcase to Barcelona from Santiago by
several people who contracted him to take photographs for travel
brochures. He testified he never examined the contents of the
suitcase.
   A three-judge tribunal deliberated 10 days before finding him
guilty of drug trafficking but cleared him of drug smuggling
charges. There are no jury trials in Spain. Owen was sentenced to
six years and one day in prison and fined $16,000.
   Following Owen's conviction, Meese issued a statement saying the
U.S. ``regrets very much this action by the Spanish court.''
   Typically each country has its own justice system,'' said the
statement by Meese, who resigned in August. ``We respect the Spanish
justice system. It is different from ours in certain respects, but
what we can hope for is that we do have good relations with the
Spanish authorities, and we hope again, we continue to believe that
the fact that the man's innocence will be ultimately be known and
understood.''
   The case raised a furor in the Spanish press, which saw the
action of the U.S. Justice Department and the testimony by several
agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency as evidence Owen was
working for the U.S. government when he was caught. He denied he was
working for the U.S. government.
   Owen's attorney appealed the sentence but later dropped the
attempt. Under the prisoner exchange agreement between Spain and the
United States, all appeals must be exhausted before application is
made for a transfer.

<HEAD>Kunstler, Sharpton Arrested After Courtroom Melee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Constitutional-rights lawyer William Kunstler and
an adviser to Tawana Brawley, the black teen who claimed she was
raped by whites, were among 16 people arrested on riot charges after
a courtroom melee.
   The scuffle Friday left 16 court officers and two demonstrators
with minor injuries, officials said.
   The melee broke out in a Brooklyn courtroom several hours after
the Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York black activist advising Miss
Brawley, and several co-defendants arrived for arraignment on
contempt charges stemming from a Sept. 29 demonstration.
   That demonstration, which tied up traffic on the Manhattan
Bridge, was organized to protest a grand jury finding that Miss
Brawley had made up her story of abduction and rape by a gang of
white men. The defendants had been forbidden by court order to block
traffic.
   About 150 supporters accompanied Sharpton for his appearance, but
only about 70 were allowed inside the courtroom. The rest stayed in
the lobby, court officials said.
   Criminal Court Judge Michael Nadel denied a motion from
Sharpton's lawyer, Alton Maddox Jr., to dismiss the charges, despite
a threat that the group would refuse to leave the room unless he
granted it.
   Nadel said he would call the case again after lunch. After
resuming the bench at 2:15 p.m., Nadel again denied the motion.
   When the judge left the bench, the group refused to leave the
courtroom.
   Dennis Quirk, head of the court officers union, said the standoff
turned into a shoving match when one of the supporters asked to
leave the courtroom and was told he would not be allowed back.
   The supporter began throwing punches at the court officers, and
several other demonstrators joined in, Quirk said.
   Sgt. John Clifford, a police spokesman, said the 16 arrested were
charged with first-degree riot, a felony, and obstruction of
governmental administration.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takao Fujinami, former chief government spokesman
and a senior member of the governing party, admitted today one of
his aides earned $148,000 in profit in 1986 through the sale of
shares made available to key politicians and business leaders at
bargain prices.
   Hideo Watanabe, another legislator from the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, also said his secretary took part in dealings
involving the stock of Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate subsidiary
of Recruit Inc., currently at the center of a scandal that now
includes 11 top Japanese politicians.
   Fujinami, former top aide to then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, said that only after consulting recently with his
secretary did he learn the aide had bought shares.
   ``It (the purchase) was an ordinary commercial practice, but I
regret that the action lacked prudence,'' said Fujinami. He denied
allegations that favors had been asked of him by Recruit in return
for the profit his aide earned upon sale of the shares.
   Fujinami and Watanabe are both members of the Nakasone faction
within the ruling party.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa admitted earlier that their secretaries purchased unlisted
shares of Recruit-Cosmos Co. and then sold them for hefty profits
after they were offered for over-the-counter trading on Oct. 31,
1986.
   Although the transactions were legal, the incident has raised
ethical quesitons regarding politicians who take advantage of their
privileged access to pre-listed shares to earn substantial profit.
   Fujinami said his aide, Eiji Tokuda, bought 12,000 shares in
Recruit-Cosmos in September 1986 at $18.50 a share and sold them for
about double as soon they were offered to the public two months
later. Watanabe said his secretary purchased 10,000 shares of
Recruit Cosmos.
   As public interest in the scandal mounts, opposition parties are
stepping up their probe.
   The Tokyo District Prosecutors' Office, whose investigators are
reportedly in possession of a list of Recruit-Cosmos shareholders
seized from a financial institution last week, is checking into the
possibility of bribery by Recruit.
   Opposition party officials have charged that Recruit offered the
Recruit-Cosmos shares to top politicians, business leaders,
journalists and others in exchange for certain privileges or
services.
   ``We have been able to disclose only 20 percent of all the
facts,'' said Tomio Sakagami of the Japan Socialist Party.
   Prosecutors last week arrested a senior Recruit-Cosmos official
for allegedly trying to bribe opposition legislator Yanosuke
Narazaki with money in return for dropping his investigation of the
scandal.
   Narazaki has spearheaded the opposition's investigation aimed of
the Recruit scandal. He said Friday he had new evidence pointing to
shady dealings in the purchase of two U.S. supercomputers by a
Japanese telecommunications monopoly and their resale to Recruit Inc.
   Nakasone agreed to the supercomputer purchase in a summit meeting
with President Reagan in 1985.
   Narazaki, in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday,
said he had proof the telecommunications giant, Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp., was providing Recruit with special favors by
selling it the two supercomputers, manufactured by U.S. Cray
Research Inc.

<HEAD>Jury Finds National Hells Angels Leader Guilty of Conspiracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club's
national leader, convicted for a plot to kill members of a rival
gang, said he feels his group scored a major victory over government
prosecutors in the 12-week trial.
   A U.S. District Court jury Friday convicted five of 10 gang
members accused of plotting attacks in Louisville and elsewhere
against members of the Outlaws.
   Only Ralph ``Sonny'' Barger Jr., 50, president of the Oakland,
Calif., Hells Angels chapter and the club's longtime national
leader, and Michael Vincent O'Farrell, 39, a former president of the
Oakland chapter, were convicted on felony charges.
   ``I think we won very handily in there. It was just too bad that
Irish (O'Farrell) and I were convicted, but we will probably win an
appeal,'' Barger said. ``I think it was a devastating blow to the
government, and I couldn't be happier with the verdict except if I
had been found innocent myself.''
   Barger and O'Farrell were convicted of conspiracy to transport
and receive explosives in interstate commerce with intent to kill
and damage buildings, said Duane Schwartz of the U.S. attorney's
office.
   The felony conviction carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Barger and three others were convicted on another charge dealing
with a stolen government manual, and five others were acquitted on
all charges, Schwartz said.
   Prosecutors said they were pleased with the verdict.
   The 10 were among 20 Hells Angels from Kentucky and four other
states indicted by a federal grand jury last year. The remainder are
to be tried beginning Feb. 6.
   The government contended the defendants planned the attacks in
revenge for the slaying of John Cleve Webb, a Hells Angel from
Alaska who was shot outside a Jefferson County bar in August 1986. A
Louisville Outlaw later pleaded guilty to reckless homicide in
Webb's death.
   Those convicted were allowed to remain free on bond pending
sentencing, set for March 10, 1989.

   The Reagan administration is hampering efforts
by charities to aid hurricane-ravaged Nicaragua, where the
Soviet-backed Sandinista government has long been opposed by the
United States, a relief group's head charges.
   ``We've been told that the political directive came down: Nothing
_ no aid at all,'' said Richard M. Walden, president of Operation
California, a Los Angeles-based relief group.
   Russ Kerr, director of Monrovia-based World Vision, said federal
officials have given no indication they will help supplement
whatever assistance his and other private charity groups can raise.
   The United States often allows private charities to use military
cargo planes to deliver aid to disaster-ravaged countries. But both
Kerr and Walden said their efforts to obtain such assistance for
Nicaragua have been rebuffed.
   As a result, Kerr said, ``We're going to charter a commercial
cargo plane, and it's going to cost us $40,000 that we could be
putting into supplies.''
   White House and State Department officials denied they are
interfering with private efforts to send aid to Nicaragua, where
more than 100 people were killed and 187,000 left homeless when
Hurricane Joan struck last weekend, the Los Angeles Times reported
today.
   However, White House officials have acknowledged they are
withholding U.S. government aid to Nicaragua while sending it to
neighboring Costa Rica.
   ``We don't trust the Sandinistas enough to give them aid,'' an
unidentified White House official told the Times. ``We don't know
how they would make use of it ... and we expect they would try to
take credit for it themselves.''
   Another unidentified official told the newspaper that Nicaragua
recently refused an offer of U.S. medical aid because it was part of
a program that also provided supplies to the U.S.-backed Contras,
which are fighting to overthrow the leftist government.
   ``We're not going to stand in their way,'' the official said of
the efforts of private charities. ``But our ability to facilitate
private aid is limited by virtue of what the Sandinista government
itself has said. They've said our assistance is not welcome.''
   Walden said the administration has told various private aid
groups that shipments of food, clothing and medicine to Nicaragua
are allowed under a U.S. embargo on supplies to the country. But
such items as electric generators and building supplies may not be
shipped without special government permits.
   The State Department has promised to expedite its consideration
of such permits but has refused to promise that any such permits
will be approved, one official told the Times.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 3,000 demonstrators took to the
streets to protest a California ballot initiative that would require
disclosure of the names of people infected with AIDS.
   No one was arrested during the noisy protest Friday night, which
was sparked when Gov. George Deukmejian announced earlier in the day
he would vote in favor of Proposition 102.
   The initiative, to appear on the Nov. 8 ballot, would require
doctors, blood banks and others to report to local health officers
any patients and blood donors they reasonably feel have been exposed
to AIDS or have tested positive for the deadly disease.
   Deukmejian said Friday the measure would ``provide public health
officials with the critical information they need to stop the spread
of AIDS, while maintaining the confidentiality of the doctor-patient
relationship.''
   The protesters gathered in the largely gay Castro district and
marched several miles past the Civic Center.
   ``The outrage was motivated by the fact that so many hundreds of
doctors and health-care workers have said people should vote no, and
every member of the governor's AIDS advisory council is opposed to
102,'' said Allen White, a leader of the protest staged by
Mobilization Against AIDS and other groups.
   Meanwhile Friday, top officials of California universities joined
the fight against the proposition.
   ``Proposition 102 would, in our opinion, undermine sound medical
and educational programs now under way in our universities and
introduce new policies based on a misunderstanding of the public
health and research needs of our state and nation with respect to
AIDS,'' said a statement by the officials. Signers included Stanford
University President Donald Kennedy, University of California
President David Gardner, University of Southern California President
James Zumberge and about a dozen other educators and medical school
officials.
   The university officials said Proposition 102 could discourage
people in high-risk groups from getting tested for AIDS and
volunteering as research subjects.

   Eight-seven people remained in
custody today after police broke up a banned protest with water
cannon, leashed dogs and tear gas.
   Independent groups that called for Friday's demonstration in
Wenceslas Square to mark Czechoslovakia's pre-communist independence
scheduled another gathering this afternoon at the same location.
   The state news agency CTK said the 87 were detained after
engaging in what it termed a ``confrontation'' organized by
``internal enemies of Socialism and debased elements ... to cast
doubt'' on official policies and discredit Czechoslovakia.
   The statement was read on state television late Friday with
pictures showing water cannon spraying the crowd of 5,000.
   Police, using batons, were seen beating some of those detained as
they moved to clear the half-mile-long square, a main thoroughfare
in the heart of Prague.
   The rally was called by four independent groups and signatories
of the Charter 77 human rights document. The gathering marked the
founding of independent democratic Czechoslovakia on Oct. 28, 1918.
   The massive show of police force followed a nationwide crackdown
on dissidents Thursday and Friday in an apparent attempt to thwart
the demonstration.
   A new movement was founded this month that brings together
Charter 77 activists and people from independent religious, peace
and other groups. Its founding document outlines 12 demands for more
civil and political freedom and was signed by at least 122 prominent
activists.

<TEXT>
   Californians share a dream today of
winning North America's largest lottery jackpot, about a $60 million
windfall that triggered sales 10 times higher than usual.
   Most of their dreams will end with the crumpling of worthless
tickets, but anyone who picks the six numbers chosen in the
televised drawing at 7:57 p.m. will win $3 million in before-tax
annual income for 20 years.
   The prize will bring the title for the continent's biggest
jackpot back to California, exceeding the $55.1 million prize
awarded by Florida on Sept. 3.
   Among those who stood in line to buy the $1 lottery tickets
Friday was Dorothy Williams, 53, of San Francisco.
   ``I come from a long line of people with money,'' she said. ``But
you know it wouldn't hurt to replenish the bloodline, so to speak,
with a little new cash.''
   Lee Tran, a 29-year-old Vietnamese immigrant standing in a line
of 10 people at a convenience store in San Francisco, offered
another motivation: ``My whole family has put up money for our
chance to win the big jackpot. This is our dream. This is why we
came to America. To make it big.''
   Tran, who lives in a three-room apartment with eight other
people, was undaunted by the 1-in-14-million odds of picking the
correct six numbers out of 49 numbers.
   Lotto 6-49 players Friday contributed to sales for the day
projected at nearly $30 million, said state lottery spokesman Bob
Taylor. Normal sales for a Friday would be about $3 million, he
added.
   The pace easily exceeded that of June 3, when the lottery logged
$22.7 million in sales preceding the award the next day of a $51.4
million jackpot, Taylor said.
   Sales today were expected to surpass those of Friday, he said.
   The jackpot for today's drawing was estimated in the $55-million
range Thursday after four previous jackpots were rolled over to the
prize. But with gambling heavier than estimated, the state-run
lottery on Friday revised the projected jackpot, which also grows
through sales of tickets, upward to more than $57 million.
   The lottomania that has stricken Californians means the figure
likely will go higher _ perhaps $60 million or more _ before betting
is cut off at 7:45 p.m., lottery officials said.
   Meantime, a state appeals court in San Francisco ruled Friday
that lottery winners who owe child support may have their winnings
used to determine the level of support they must pay.
   The court ruled that $100,000 won by a man in the state lottery
in 1986 is income, which is used to determine the level of child
support. The appeals court ruling reverses a lower court decision
that lottery winnings are property, not income.

<TEXT>
   Two masked youths fatally shot a national
policeman in this Basque city today, and police blamed the attack on
Basque separatists.
   The shooting took place outside a police station in the northern
city of Bilbao, police said. The youths fled the scene in a stolen
car, which police later found abandoned about five miles away.
   No group claimed responsibility, but police said they suspected
the Basque separatist organization ETA, which seeks independence
from Spain for the three-province northern Basque region.
   Officer Cristobal Diaz Garcia suffered a single bullet wound to
the chest and died at nearby Basurto Hospital, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed more than 600
killings, mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers, in their
20-year violent campaign for independence. ETA is an acronym in the
Basque language that stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty.

   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
blocked roads and set tires ablaze today as the occupied lands were
shut down by a general strike called to mark a 1956 Israeli massacre
of Arab villagers.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army put nearly 260,000 Palestinians in 11
refugee camps and neighborhoods under curfew as it braced for
trouble during the strike, called by underground leaders of the
10-month-old Arab rebellion.
   But the curfew, which forces residents to stay indoors, failed to
prevent clashes at the Maghazi refugee camp. Hospital officials said
a teen-ager was shot in the abdomen and two men wounded in the legs.
   Protests also occurred in Gaza City. Officials at Gaza's Ahli
Arab Hospital said troops opened fire, wounding two men in the legs.
The army confirmed there were riots in Gaza and said it was checking
the reports on casualties.
   Clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing Palestinian youths
also were reported in Ramallah, just north of Jerusalem. Soldiers
fired in the air and there were no injuries, Arab sources said.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, police used tear gas to break up a
protest demonstration after Arabs blocked off a road in the Jabaal
El-Mukaber neighborhood, police said. No injuries were reported.
   Outlawed Palestinian flags were flying from electricity poles,
mosques and churches in West Bank towns and cities. Most businesses
were closed, transportation was at a standstill and black smoke rose
above burning tires.
   ``Let's burn them on their election day,'' said a newly painted
slogan in the biblical city of Bethlehem, referring to Tuesday's
parliamentary election in Israel. Another slogan in Ramallah said,
``The intefadeh (uprising) will continue until liberation day.''
   Troops in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, ordered Arabs to
paint over slogans sprayed on walls the night before.
   The curfews in Gaza followed scattered demonstrations Friday in
which five Palestinians were wounded by troops firing plastic
bullets, the army said. Arab reports said six people from age 13 to
21 suffered wounds.
   At least 304 Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed and
7,000 wounded since the uprising against Israeli rule began Dec. 8.
Israel took the lands from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Mideast war.
   Leaders of the insurrection called general strike today to mark
the Oct. 29, 1956 massacre in Kafr Qasim, an Israeli-Arab village,
by an Israeli army patrol. The patrol fired on villagers returning
from work in the fields who unknowingly violated a curfew declared
on the day that Israel began its Sinai campaign against Egypt.
Forty-six men were killed.

<HEAD>Government Ignores Hunger Strike By Detainees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today scoffed at a
hunger strike by 18 people who have been imprisoned without trial
for more than a year, saying their protest will not win them freedom.
   The 18 detainees, including opposition leader Lim Kit Siang,
began the hunger strike Thursday, according to Lee Lam Thye, deputy
secretary-general of the opposition Democratic Action Party and
acting leader of the House.
   The government declared the 18 people a security threat in
October 1987 and imprisoned them under the Internal Security Act.
   Deputy Home Affairs Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayub told
reporters today the strike was a stunt by the Democratic Action
Party, and he doubted whether the detainees were actually refusing
all food.
   ``Do not threaten the government. It knows what it is doing as it
is a responsible government,'' said Megat Junid, who met with
families of the detainees Friday at the Parliament building.
   Parliament rejected a motion Friday to discuss the hunger strike,
prompting all 19 Democratic Action Party lawmakers to storm out of
the session.
   The 18 detainees were among 106 people arrested in October 1987
after the government accused them of stirring up Malay-Chinese
racial tensions. Since January, the government has released all but
the 18 detainees.

   Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci met with
King Hussein today after discussing military cooperation between
Jordan and the United States with other top government officials.
   There was no immediate word on the substance of Carlucci's talks
with Hussein at the palace, which followed a meeting of the
Jordanian-American joint military commission with the secretary
leading the U.S. deleagtion.
   The panel oversees the use of U.S. military aid to Jordan _
nearly $50 million this year alone _ as well as training and joint
maneuvers.
   Jordanian military officials also put on a military display for
Carlucci at Umm Qais, a peak 50 miles northwest of Amman overlooking
the borders with Syria, Lebanon and Israel. Carlucci arrived in
Amman on Friday night on the first leg of a three-country Middle
East tour.
   Jordan is still technically at war with Israel. But both the
United States and Israel have made the moderate Jordanian monarch
the cornerstone of their Middle East peace efforts.
   In 1986, Congress blocked a plan to sell jet aircraft and
anti-aircraft missiles worth $1.9 billion to Jordan until it began
peace talks with Israel.
   An angry Hussein rejected the pressure and vowed never again to
seek a major weapons system from the United States.
   He went to the Soviet Union for anti-aircraft missiles and to
France and Britain for advanced jet fighters. But Jordan still uses
large amounts of American weaponry and trains many of its officers
in the United States.
   Carlucci leaves Jordan for Egypt on Monday and ends his tour in
Israel a few days after that country goes to the polls Nov. 1 to
elect a new government. He will be the first U.S. defense secretary
to visit Israel since 1984.

sick from inhaling a piece of fur.
   When Clarence W. Dupnik began vomiting and choking Friday, a Pima

   A doctor said it could be in a lung, but probably was in his

   ``This was not scary, although I couldn't talk at one point,''
Dupnik said. ``But I could breathe for the most part.''
   Dupnik, County Attorney Stephen D. Neely, and Tucson Police Sgt.
Paul Hallums were at an elementary school addressing students when a
piece of fur from the costume came loose and Dupnik inhaled it
through his mouth.
   He quietly left, he said.

``Sure. This was just an accident. A rare accident.''

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Joan may have caused more
material damage to Nicaragua in 24 hours than a civil war has in
seven years, striking a savage blow at an economy many thought could
not be worse.
   The week following the Oct. 22 hurricane revealed massive
destruction. Tens of thousands of homes were blown apart and mud
slides covered villages. Crops, roads and bridges were washed out.
   More than 100 people died and more than 180,000 were left
homeless in the nation of 3 million. At least 33 bridges were
destroyed and another 33 were damaged.
   ``I have nothing now, nothing,'' said Luis Garcia, 36, one of
those left homeless in the eastern port city of Bluefields. ``The
prices were high, the salaries too low to eat. Now what will
happen?''
   Rebuilding means more foreign loans and debts. Crop damage means
lost revenue and higher domestic prices. Industrial destruction
means lower output and unemployment.
   Before the storm, Nicaragua's foreign debt was $6 billion,
inflation had spiraled to a 4,000 percent annually, and the average
worker earned $20 a month. The trade deficit last year was $520
million.
   The Sandinista government had blamed most of the economic
problems on its seven-year war with U.S.-backed rebels, and last
week it compared the struggle against the storm to the war against
the Contras. More than 50 percent of the national budget goes toward
defense.
   Neither Soviet bloc infusions of $500 million a year nor a series
of economic measures succeeded in righting the battered economy.
Nicaragua once exported rice and beans but now has to import those
staples.
   Late last year, there were shortages of just about everything.
Long lines formed for basics.
   Authorities had shown some optimism about this year's harvests
because some farmers from war-torn areas returned to their villages
after a March cease-fire agreement. Land that had lain fallow for
years was planted.
   But preliminary storm damage estimates indicated severe damage to
crops nationwide. Salvaging coffee, the largest money-maker at $122
million, is a top priority.
   The government said the plants didn't suffer as much as had been
feared but that the harvest, due to start in November, will be
severely hampered by washed out access roads.
   Miles and miles of rice paddies in central Chontales and Rio San
Juan provinces were flooded. Thousands of head of cattle were lost
and thousands of acres of banana trees blown over by the winds.
   The government figured that up to 40 percent of the banana crop,
which brought in $14.4 million last year, was lost.
   The Atlantic coast, which bore the brunt of Hurricane Joan's
force, suffered the worst damage.
   Almost every structure in Bluefields, in scores of Indian
villages and on the Corn Islands turned to rubble. The fishing
industry, the region's main economic activity, was paralyzed.
Processing plants were destroyed, boats shattered.
   The government said damage to the fishing industry left 1,500
people unemployed.
   In the north-central mountain villages, where most of the war has
been fought, scores of villages were isolated by felled bridges and
mud slides.
   In the southwest, officials reported severe loss to bean, sorghum
and corn crops.
   By the middle of last week, about 6,000 homeless from the
Atlantic Coast and the south had fled to Managua.
   The capital is ill-equipped to handle the new influx, having
absorbed thousands of refugees from war zones. Water and electricity
are rationed for the population of about 1 million _ about one-third
of the nation's inhabitants.
   The capital was never rebuilt after the 1972 earthquake that
killed more than 10,000 people. Ragtag homes of wood with zinc roofs
sprang up on dirt fields around Managua.
   Public discontent over the economic situation has caused the
government its worst political and social crises.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that
deposed dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   Political opposition figures, just weeks before the storm, said
the situation in their country had never been worse.
   ``We can only hope we get international help or we can't do it,''
Gilberto Cuadra, the president of a coalition of anti-government
private enterprise groups, said a few days after the hurricane.
   ``Then we have to hope that if $3 billion arrives, that the
Sandinista Front doesn't keep $1 billion for the army,'' he said.

<HEAD>Softer Silhouettes Win As Hemlines Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Softer lines and longer clothes were two main points
in the new wave of outfits seen in summer ready-to-wear shows last
week. But the bonanza of choices made any ``war of the hemlines''
academic.
   Real-life clothes rather than gimmicky or strange costumes have
taken over as more designers aim to please practical women rather
than fashion groupies.
   Those who love short skirts can still rejoice, because there are
plenty of them, but the overly seductive look is fizzling and the
saucy miniskirt is seen only on the beach.
   The new silhouette is called A-line, trapeze or pyramid _ a shape
seemingly inspired by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid outside the Louvre.
To complete the pyramid form, shoulders had little or no padding.
   Full ``elephant-leg'' palazzo pants or pantskirts have taken the
city by storm. Started last season by Montana, Lacroix and Lagerfeld
at Chanel, they've caught on.
   Montana swept the stage with grand pantskirts, light as air in
soft, silky fabrics and shades of peach, bone and beige, with all
kinds of toppers. Some had floppy lapels, others came with a
sun-pleated flaring skirt effect in the back.
   Jumpsuits came back into the picture, often backless or strapped
with halter tops. Lacroix showed his in bright linen topped with a
bolero.
   Others showed the pants striped and sporty. At Chanel they came
out in white with belted gold-buttoned cardigan jackets.
   For hot weather, designers brought out wide and fairly long
shorts, some with suspenders. Little bloomers caught on as well, but
only for the younger crowd.
   Classic pants at Givenchy and Saint Laurent were splendid. Tight
pedal pushers or matador pants were another alternative, sometimes
with flared A-line toppers and tunics.
   Lagerfeld won kudos for his pleated long skirts, with cardigans
and jackets spruced up with stripes near the hem. For distinctive
at-home wear, he offered flowered coat dresses.
   Saint Laurent's best concession to the trapeze line was a fitted
white pique sun dress with a circular skirt.
   Most designers gave a nod to the short skirt, and those who
lopped off hemlines can still feel safe. Givenchy, Valentino, Saint
Laurent and others varied the straight skirt with tulip wrapped or
back-wrapped models.
   For understated chic, the jacket was very long at Yamamoto. Saint
Laurent showed faultless tailored suit models, Lacroix had several
boleros, and Bohan's jackets at Dior had his favorite little
martingale back belt.
   Fitted short or long jackets with a suggestion of a peplum over
lean dresses or suits added curves to ultra-feminine suits and
strapless cocktail dresses. Middy-blouse collars and swopped, curved
lapels gave suits and dresses a new look.
   The yachting life inspired most designers, who added sailor
outfits to their array of clothes.
   Safari-style clothes came with belted bush jackets and shorts,
wild animal spots on all softs of fabrics, dressed up in chiffon for
evening wear at Saint Laurent.
   Scherrer introduced an African-print swimsuit with an
off-shoulder wrap and matching chiffon tropical print jumpsuit.
   Angelo Tarlazzi did his Indian look with long silk tunics or
jackets with a sari-scarf wrap over skirts and pants. Valentino's
print mixes harked back to the layered looks of the 60s.
   While the strapless bustier is still around in evening wear,
puffy, overdecorated dresses have given away to sophisticated dinner
dresses and tea gowns or flowing pajamas with draped tops that look
back to the 1930s.
   Besides the ubiquitous navy, black and white, colors were at
opposite poles _ subtle and autumnal or flashy and bright. The
subdued shades included putty, sand, burnt orange, ruddy brown,
mossy greens, khaki and pea soup. For a softer touch in the fluid
clothes, designers worked with fabrics in smoky rose, peach, and
spice tones like mustard, saffron, cinnamon and cafe au lait.
   In the hotter scheme, optimists like Lacroix chose sunny yellow,
acid tones of lime and chartreuse, neon green, electric pink, flame
red, peacock and turquoise.
   For the new, wearable clothes, fabrics looked softer than ever,
from zephyr-light wools for daytime to organza, crepe de chine and
silk chiffon, lame and luxrex for evening.
   Linen is still a favorite, but it looks less rumpled this year.
Poplin, cotton voile cloque fabrics and pique were other summer
favorites, and lace was splashed about with abandon.

   A moderate earthquake rocked the Katmandu

the government said. The quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   Seismologists said the epicenter of the tremor was in
Shiramthali, 19 miles northeast of Katmandu.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A quake with a reading of 5 can cause considerable
damage in populated areas. A quake measuring 6 can cause severe
damage.

<HEAD>Soviet Shuttle Launch Delayed Indefinitely By Launch System Problem</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Tass report explaining cause of
cancellation. TRIMS to tighten. No pickup.
^By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fault found at the last minute in one of the
launch systems of the Soviet space shuttle forced scientists today
to indefinitely postpone the maiden voyage of the unmanned craft.
   The official Tass news agency said a computer halted the
countdown 51 seconds before launch to prevent the booster, known as
Energiya, from hitting the launch platform during liftoff.
   ``The assembly platform for emergency evacuation of cosmonauts
... didn't move away from the Energiya body to a safe distance,''
Tass said. The platform is believed to be an arm-like structure that
stretches to the booster.
   A computer that senses 140 elements of the launch system
terminated the launch process, Tass said. The report quoted the test
control chief at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia, air
force Maj. Gen. V. Gudilin.
   Gudilin told Tass he didn't think it would be long before the
launch would be attempted again, but he said a thorough analysis of
today's problem would have to be completed before a new blastoff
date was decided.
   Fuel was drained from the rocket, Tass said, and it appeared a
second launch attempt would not be made today.
   The shuttle, named Buran, or snowstorm in Russian, was originally
set to lift off late Friday from the Baikonur launch site on the
Central Asian steppe in Kazakhstan. But Tass and Radio Moscow
announced earlier today a four-hour delay, one half-hour after the
scheduled launch time expired.
   Then, seconds before liftoff a second time, Tass in a terse
statement announced there was an ``indefinite'' delay.
   There was no live report from Baikonur by either radio or
television. Foreign reporters were not allowed to travel to Baikonur.
   Buran was to make two orbits and return to a concrete landing
strip eight miles from the launch site. Reports indicated the
initial flight would be devoted entirely to checking out the craft
and would not be used to deploy satellites or conduct any other
missions.
   Ships stationed in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, a satellite
network and a string of ground stations were poised to communicate
with the craft and monitor its flight, Soviet television said in a
brief report.
   Buran is attached to the Energiya rocket, the world's most
powerful launcher, and four liquid-fuel boosters. It looks like the
U.S. space shuttle.
   But Soviet officials say it can carry a payload of 66,000 pounds,
compared to the U.S. shuttle's 55,000 pounds, is safer and more
flexible.
   The fully automated guidance system permits scientists to send
the craft into space for the first time without cosmonauts,
decreasing the risk to human life, Soviet officials said.
   In the past, the officials have been critical of the U.S. shuttle
program that was stalled until this fall after seven astronauts were
killed in the explosion of the Challenger in January 1986.
   In a report late Friday, the television news program Vremya
revealed Soviet military involvement in the Soviet shuttle program.
   ``As always in our country, military specialists participate in
crucial, dangerous tests,'' a correspondent said in a report from
Baikonur.
   It identified the military official overseeing shuttle operations
as Alexander A. Maksimov. It identified him as the Defense
Ministry's top specialist on ``multiple-use space transport systems
and the prospect of their development.''
   Soviet officials repeatedly have criticized military use of the
U.S. space shuttle, and have called for space to be used only for
peaceful purposes.
   The U.S. Defense Department, in its 1988 publication Soviet
Military Power, says the Soviets might use a shuttle to deploy
anti-satellite and ballistic missile defense weapons.
   Reports Friday said the Buran can carry as many as 10 people _
four cosmonauts and six passengers _ and placed its cost of Energiya
and Buran at about that of the U.S. shuttle, some $10 billion.
   Energiya, which can lift a payload of more than 100 tons, has
been used only once before. On a test flight in May 1987, its
payload failed to reach orbit, but Soviet officials said the problem
was with the guidance system of the satellite rather than with the
gigantic booster.

   Israel's 2.9 million voters are feeling edgy and
short-tempered as the campaign for Tuesday's parliamentary elections
draws to a close.
   A great deal is at stake.
   For the first time since Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza
Strip in 1967, the central issue in a national election campaign is
whether most of the occupied territories can be safely exchanged for
peace.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc says
``no.'' Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the left-leaning Labor
Party says ``yes.''
   The two parties represent more than different attitudes toward
making peace with the Arabs. They envision two different Israels.
   ``In the broadest terms, the elections pit two images of Israel
against each other,'' said Harry Wall, the Israel director of the
U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League.
   Five wars and 40 years of conflict with the Arabs have made
Israelis suspicious. Peres has found it difficult to overcome
voters' doubts about Jordan's King Hussein as a potential peace
partner.
   A campaign debate on Ben Yehuda Street, the central shopping
thoroughfare, illustrated the reservations:
   ``If King Hussein wants peace so bad, why hasn't he done anything
in the past four years?'' a man in his 20s shouted at a Labor Party
worker promoting the idea of an international peace conference.
   ``If we give up the land, the Palestinians will have a state. It
will make the Arabs stronger, and we will have a war again in 10
years,'' said another young man, waving his finger at the Labor
activist.
   Peres has tried to use such fears to his party's advantage.
   ``If Likud annexes the territories, we are going to have an Arab
majority,'' he said during a tour of the Likud stronghold of Ramle,
in central Israel.
   There are fewer Arabs than Jews in Israel and the occupied
territories, but Peres was referring to the majority that could
result from Arab births.
   To dispel doubts about King Hussein's sincerity, Peres aides
worked behind the scenes to arrange for the Jordanian monarch to
appear on ABC's ``Nightline'' and to call Peres' peace ideas ``a
step forward.''
   In the only TV debate of the campaign, Peres drove home the point
that he had a possible partner in peace talks and tried to put
Shamir on the defensive.
   But the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories seems to have worked in favor of Likud, which advocates
the use of more military force to put down protests.
   ``In people's minds, defense takes precedence over peace, and
(Labor's Defense Minister) Yitzhak Rabin has not been successful in
putting down the intefadeh,'' said pollster Hannoch Smith, using the
Arab term for the uprising.
   Wall said Likud's commitment to retaining all the land of Israel
is underscored more by distrust than dogma. It stems from the fear
that Jews, history's perennial victims, can expect no favors from
the outside world and certainly none from Arab enemies, he said.
   Labor's Israel is more self-assured, he said. Labor sees Israel
as belonging to the Western community of nations and willing to take
risks to remain so and to break the cycle of war, he said.
   The views tend to be fixed from one election to another.
   What is changing is the demographic makeup of the electorate, and
this is working in Likud's favor.
   A larger percentage of voters are younger. Many serve in the
occupied territories, and polls indicate they have more hawkish
views as a result.
   Also, for the first time, a majority of voters are Sephardic, or
Jews whose families come from Middle Eastern nations. They have
traditionally adopted a tougher line on dealing with the Arabs than
the Ashkenazim of European lineage.
   Those wavering between the two major blocs are estimated to range
between 4 percent and 8 percent of the vote. Television ads and
personal campaign appearances have concentrated on winning over
these so-called ``floating voters.''
   The polished and articulate Peres, a 65-year-old protege of
Israel's first premier, David Ben-Gurion, has consistently shown
more personal popularity in polls than the crusty and
uncommunicative Shamir, a 73-year-old former operations chief of the
Mossad intelligence agency and a pre-state underground leader with a
passion for secrecy.
   But both are familiar to Israeli voters, and their arguments have
been heard repeatedly. Since 1984, when the electorate was evenly
divided, and a national unity government was formed, Peres and
Shamir have each served two years as prime minister.
   ``It's difficult for people to get excited about the elections
because the players aren't very exciting people. But I wouldn't say
the voters are bored. They're interested in the issues,'' said
Yonathan Shapiro, a political specialist at Tel Aviv University.
   Polls indicate the vast majority of Israelis do not want another
coalition government like the one formed after the stalemated 1984
elections. But the polls say the two large parties are running
neck-and-neck and a replay is possible.

   The escapes brought to nine the number of East Germans who fled
their communist homeland in three days.
   The three men crossed the Saale River on Saturday after sawing
through border barriers, police said. They reported that three other
East Germans escaped over the Czech border late Friday.
   On Thursday, another trio of East Germans fled to West Germany by
climbing on top of their car and scrambling over border barriers.
   The nine who escaped were not identified and police reported no
injuries.
   More than 349 East Germans have fled to the West this year,
according to the West German government.

   It said the incident involved 24 political prisoners who had been
on a hunger strike for the past two weeks to protest prison

<NOTE>Eds: Subs 6th graf, `The decision ...,' to CORRECT spelling of
Pentecostal.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who sued her former pastor for
seducing her has been awarded $130,000 by a jury, a verdict intended
partly as a warning to other ministers.
   ``We want the community to see that this can't keep happening,''
juror Cathy Zurfluh said Friday. ``It's got to stop somewhere.''
   Carol Gabrielson Edwards wept after the Pierce County Superior
Court jury verdict was announced, saying she would have been happy
with a $1 award.
   ``I just didn't want any other woman to ever have to go through
what I went through,'' she sobbed. ``If I can save one woman from
ever going through it, then that's all I cared about. Just having
the 12 agree with me meant the world to me.''
   After the verdict was announced, Eileen M. Lawrence, attorney for
ex-pastor Jack McDonald and his wife, Shirley, served Ms. Edwards
and her ex-husband, Ira Gabrielson of Puyallup, with a malicious
prosecution lawsuit.
   The decision followed more than two days of deliberations in the
case against McDonald and the strife-torn Community Chapel and Bible
Training Center, an independent Pentecostal church based in Burien,
a suburb south of Seattle.
   The Tacoma branch of the church has been closed.
   During a six-week trial, Ms. Edwards accused McDonald of coercing
her into a sexual relationship in 1985, causing her emotional trauma
and ending her 19-year marriage, then banishing her from the church
when she broke off the affair after two months.
   The jury found damages of $200,000 to Ms. Edwards but reduced the
award to $130,000 by holding that she was 35 percent to blame.
Damage to her ex-husband was set at $20,000, less 15 percent for his
negligence, and the jury awarded him $17,000.
   ``It's a real triumph for justice,'' said Don Hannula, Ms.
Edwards' attorney. ``Hopefully it's a message to others in positions
of authority _ particularly pastors _ they're going to be held to a
standard in which their behavior is going to be accountable.''
   Much of the testimony dealt with a church teaching that each
member should become closer to God by forming a ``spiritual
connection'' with someone of the opposite sex other than one's
spouse, dancing together in church services, staring into each
other's eyes and spending time together.
   Scores of followers have been divorced after becoming
romantically involved with spiritual connection partners, and a
lawsuit pending in King County accuses church founder Donald Lee
Barnett of sexual misconduct with three church members.
   Hannula said McDonald used that doctrine to seduce Ms. Edwards
after she came to him for spiritual advice and marital counseling.

<HEAD>Dukakis Criticizes Japan Decision; Bush Says He's Divisive</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Bush in top 5 grafs, picking up in 4th graf pvs,
``Michael Dukakis</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today the Republicans won't ``stand
up for American jobs,'' citing White House rejection of rice
farmers' pleas for direct action against Japanese trade barriers.
Bush said Dukakis was trying to divide the country in his campaign
attacks.
   Bush, setting out on a six-stop bus tour in northeastern
Illinois, renewed his own attack on Dukakis, saying, ``I am not
going to let that liberal governor divide this country. I am going
to bring it together.''
   Appearing before a crowd that filled a small gymnasium at McHenry
County Community College, Bush declared he was pleased with how the
campaign was going but said, ``The result still hangs in the balance
out there.''
   ``I'd hate to be my opponent dragging myself around the country,
trying to convince Americans that everything's going to hell in a
handbasket,'' Bush said.
   Meanwhile, the Democrats released the text of a five-minute paid
speech vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen will make on
television Sunday night, saying that the Republicans ``trash the
truth.''
   ``Michael Dukakis says that the best for America is yet to come,
and I believe that,'' Bentsen says in the ad. ``But in this campaign
it's been hard to think about that America, for all the noisy smears
that fill the airwaves.''
   Dukakis, flying west to renew his battle for California, left
Boston early today after aides distributed his statement criticizing
Friday's administration decision to turn down a rice industry
request for a federal investigation of Japanese barriers to rice
imports.
   ``The Reagan-Bush administration's decision to reject the just
claim of American rice farmers raises the question of whose side
they are on,'' he said. ``The facts are clear. Japan's determination
to keep its market closed hurts our farmers and serves only Japan.
   ``This decision is only the latest instance of the Republicans'
refusal to stand up for American jobs and American farmers in world
markets,'' Dukakis said.
   Bush, speaking a day earlier in Sacramento, Calif., where he was
endorsed by the California Correctional Police Officers Association
and the International Association of Correctional Officers, said he
believes most of the policemen who have endorsed him consider
themselves Democrats.
   ``A lot of mainstream Americans feel that the national Democratic
Party in 1988 just simply doesn't represent them any more,'' he said.
   ``You might almost say that the Democratic Party today suffers
from a splitpersonality with a rank and file made up of some of the
best of America, the silent majority . . .'' he said. ``But the
leadership, much of it, is a remnant of the 60s, the new left, those
campus radicals grown old, the peace marchers and the nuclear freeze
activists.''
   Nixon used the term silent majority in a 1969 television address
after demonstrations against the Vietnam War had been mounting. He
appealed for support of his policies from ``the great silent
majority of my fellow Americans.''
   Bush, who attended a rally in Omaha, Neb., on his way to
Illinois, was courting votes in the Chicago suburbs today.
   Dukakis was to appear later today in the Watts section of Los
Angeles. Both campaigns are fighting hard for that state's 47
electoral votes.
   In Michigan on Friday, the Massachusetts governor found himself a
short distance from the facility where he rode around in an Abrams
M-1 tank Sept. 13 _ a televised demonstration that turned into a
public relations disaster and raw material for a Bush ad.
   Recalling a remark Bush made earlier this year while describing
the efficiency of Soviet tank maneuvers, Dukakis said, ``I am very
concerned when a vice president of the United States who wants to be
president comes back from Europe and says to the American people,
`I'd like to bring some of those Soviet mechanics over here to tell
American workers what to do.'''
   His paraphrase of Bush's words brought boos from the crowd in
Warren, Mich., where tanks are manufactured.
   ``I don't think we need any Soviet mechanics telling American
workers how to produce,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis has been interviewed on a series of network television
programs recently as he tries to make up ground in the polls, and he
accused his Republican rival of avoiding such encounters as the
election nears.
   ``Mr. Bush is out there in his little cocoon,'' Dukakis said.
``They won't let him out. We're taking our case directly to the
American people.''
   Top campaign official John Sasso was telling reporters that polls
taken by the campaign showed Dukakis gaining nationally this week
and drawing within four points in the important state of California.
   Independent polls have shown national Bush leads of eight to 15
points, but Sasso said ``there is measurable movement this week'' in
Dukakis' direction. He declined to give exact numbers.
   Dukakis' running mate, Bentsen, was back in his native Texas to
cast an absentee ballot that includes his name on the presidential
ticket and as a contender for re-election to the U.S. Senate.
   Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, back in Washington after campaigning in
Pennsylvania's Republican heartland, sounded a Halloween theme
during his travels Friday.
   Quayle said Dukakis might be having trouble deciding what to wear
Monday night. ``If he dresses up like a moderate he scares the
liberals in his party,'' he said. ``If he dresses like a
conservative nobody will believe it. And if he comes as he is, he
scares America.''

<HEAD>Two Bushes: Kind in the Morning, Cutting After Lunch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's usually in the morning that the proponent
of a ``kinder, gentler nation'' voices positive themes and lofty
thoughts. The fire-breathing George Bush shows up later in the day.
   In the waning days of the campaign, there often seem to be two
George Bushes on the campaign trail _ the statesman and the slasher.
   And while campaign strategists vigorously deny they are seeking
to project a split personality, Bush himself has joked with
reporters about ``Skippy, my evil twin,'' referring to a character
created by G.B. Trudeau, ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist and Bush nemesis.
   Late last week, the Republican presidential nominee vowed at a
campaign stop in California to ease up on ``the negative side'' and
bring ``a kinder and quieter finish to this campaign.'' But that
didn't last long.
   In the same remarks, he lashed rival Michael Dukakis anew for the
now-changed Massachusetts prison program under which a murder
convict escaped while on furlough and attacked a Maryland couple.
   Bush's road-show managers have come up with a formula that, for
the most part, they have been sticking to since the final
presidential debate two weeks ago: one major speech per day on a
selected issue, usually in the morning, followed by lively stump
rallies before friendly audiences.
   The serious speeches, sometimes including lofty passages, are
usually done early enough to enable Bush's words to find time on the
evening network television shows.
   And the speeches are often reinforced by television commercials
running at the same time _ for instance, the airing of the Bush
campaign ad ridiculing Dukakis' ride in an Army tank if defense is
the issue of the day.
   The morning speeches give Bush a steady, measured, even
``presidential'' bearing for national consumption, aides suggest.
They also enable him to deny that he is engaging solely in negative
campaigning.
   At the same time, the slashing rallies, usually held later in the
day, often in high school gymnasiums packed with squealing
teen-agers, give the campaign a driving edge while keeping local GOP
campaign workers energized.
   The ``nice'' Bush talks about bipartisanship in foreign policy,
about ending chemical weapons, about a ``larger vision of a free
world at peace,'' of ``working together to create opportunity and a
good life for all,'' about joining ``our voices in a mighty chorus
that will end homelessness.''
   But his ``mean'' twin snarls ``read my lips, no new taxes,''
declares ``I'm not the guy that named Massachusetts
`Taxachusetts,''' and tells audiences that convicts who might be
invited to ``make my day'' by actor Clint Eastwood are bid, ``have a
nice vacation'' by Dukakis.
   He continually calls Dukakis a ``card-carrying member of the
ACLU,'' drawing out the letters A-C-L-U with sarcasm and suggesting
Dukakis sympathizes more with the rights of prisoners than of
victims. He brands his rival ``untested and inexperienced'' in
foreign policy.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said that the pattern of one
``serious speech'' a day touching on tried-and-tested themes,
followed by attack speeches at rallies, seems to be working _
despite recent polls suggesting voters are wearying of negative
campaigning on both sides.
   ``This has been a very mild campaign by any historical
standards,'' Atwater said. ``It hasn't been dirty and there hasn't
been mud-slinging. ... But I'm not Pollyanna. We have to deal with
the system the way it is.''
   Atwater added that, in Bush appearances as well as in his
advertising, the mix that is being sought is about 50-50
positive-negative _ but he doesn't call it ``negative,'' he calls it
``comparative.''
   And Bush himself echoes this line of defense, claiming his stump
blasts at Dukakis are ``not an attack. It is a comparative
difference on the issues.''
   Sometimes Bush's jumps between nice and naughty are dizzying. One
recent campaign day, he told a University of Toledo audience in the
morning that he wanted to be known as the president who ended the
use of chemical weapons around the world and who ushered in ``a
whole new era of peace.''
   But a few hours later, he was telling a rally in Lancaster, Ohio,
``I'm not going to be out-hustled by the liberal governor from
Massachusetts. ... He's got a terrible problem. He can't get elected
unless things get worse. And things aren't going to get worse unless
he gets elected.''
   Sometimes Bush himself lets audiences know in advance what kind
of speech they're going to get.
   Addressing a police group in New York, Bush said: ``Given the
enthusiasm that I sense here, I would like to help define for you
the man I am running against and throw a little red political meat
out there. But I can't do it. This is for serious things today.''

<TEXT>
   The army is rounding up civilians in the
capital and forcing them, under threat of execution, to carry
military supplies through the jungle to rebel battlefronts, say some
Burmese who claim to have escaped.
   Eleven people who say they were forced into unpaid labor were
interviewed recently at this base of the Karen rebels. They said
they were arrested in the capital of Rangoon on Oct. 4, tied with
ropes, and threatened with execution if they tried to escape.
   Trucked to frontier areas, they were loaded down with weapons,
ammunition and other military supplies, they said. They said they
were given no food.
   Ku Thein, a 48-year-old man who said he drives a pedal-taxi, said
some in his group were beaten by government soldiers. His own
shoulders and back were marked by still bleeding scars that he
blamed on having carried six, 81mm mortar shells in a basket
strapped to his back.
   The group said they escaped Burmese troops Oct. 18.
   International human rights groups have criticized the Burmese
army for allegedly forcing people to haul supplies into rugged
frontier areas where ethnic minorities have been fighting for
autonomy. In the past, most unpaid workers were taken from the rebel
groups rather than from the streets of Rangoon, where Burmans
predominate.
   Two million of Burma's 38 million people are ethnic Karens. They
have organized the strongest of about 12 anti-government
insurgencies.
   Rangoon's military government, which seized power Sept. 18 and
crushed a popular uprising for multiparty democracy, announced Oct.
17 that 1,120 people had been rounded up in Rangoon to serve as
porters working for a daily wage.
   The announcement described those recruited as ``looters,
criminals who bunk and sleep in pagoda pavilions, buildings and
railways stations at night; and thieves and muggers.''
   It said students and government workers with permanent homes
would not be affected by what is popularly known as
``porter-snatching.''
   The 11 interviewed said they had regular jobs which included
selling pork and working in the Rangoon dockyards. The dock worker
said he often slept aboard a ship, but others said they had
permanent homes.
   Ku Thein said he was putting away his taxi when soldiers came to
arrest him. He said they did not tell him why he was being detained
or where he would be taken.
   He and the others said they were paid nothing and had to subsist
largely on banana shoots and other food they could forage in the
jungle.
   Officials of the Karen National Union, the rebel group that
controls much of the Thai-Burmese frontier, said more than 70 people
escaped from the forced labor. Some wanted to return home, but
others feared being seized again, the rebels said.
   Earlier this year, Amnesty International, the London-based human
rights group, published two reports describing ``a consistent
pattern of gross violations of human rights'' by the Burmese
military in trying to keep down the rebel minorities.
   The reports cited summary executions and torture of Karens, Mons,
Shans and other ethnic groups, as well as killing and extensive
abuse of unpaid laborers.
   Josef Silverstein, an American author of several books on Burma,
said that about 13,000 peasants were recruited as porters for one
major offensive against insurgents last year.
   ``They were forced to walk ahead of troops in order to test for
mines; they were forced to carry munitions and supplies and, if they
refused or fell, they were beaten and often killed,'' the professor
at Rutgers University said.

   The 20 people executed during the infamous Salem
witch trials of 1692 are mostly remembered in history lessons and
tourist attractions, but some of their descendants are organizing to
emphasize their humanity.
   ``We want to keep the memory alive,'' said Howard Hay of Boston,
a descendant of accused witch Susanna Martin. ``This type of thing
keeps happening around the world. People keep getting persecuted. I
don't know if we'll ever learn the lesson.''
   He is president of the recently formed Sons and Daughters of the
Victims of Colonial Witch Trials, which has 45 members, all direct
descendants of the trial victims.
   Hay founded the group with Wayne Higley of Stoneham, a descendant
of accused witch Rebecca Nurse. They are members of numerous
genealogical societies and discovered their link to the witch trial
victims while researching their lineage.
   Using standard statistical formulas, they say there could be up
to 20 million descendants of the accused witches in the United
States. One of the more famous, according to Gary Boyd Roberts of
the New England Genealogical Society, is Joan Kennedy, former wife
of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, whose ancestry dates back to accused
witch Mary Esty. She is not a member of the group.
   The witchcraft hysteria began during the winter of 1691 when a
West Indian slave, Tituba, told voodoo tales to a group of young
girls and taught them palmistry and magic.
   Tituba and two other women were killed as witches after a doctor
examined them and pronounced them bewitched. The scare continued for
about a year, resulting in the execution of 20 people and the
imprisonment of 150.
   The descendants' group is concentrating on the approaching 300th
anniversary of the witch trials. They hope to hold an observance on
Gallows Hill in Salem, where accused witches were hanged.
   ``Until now, there hasn't been anything to really remember them
by,'' Hay said. ``There hasn't even been so much as a plaque. We
want people to know the real story. These people were human beings
who were unjustly accused.''
   Higley said many of those first accused of witchcraft were either
community outcasts or victims of neighborhood feuds.
   The group said the city of Salem has been uncomfortable about
remembering the accused witches except in terms of tourist promotion.
   ``These people had no connection with witches,'' Higley said.
``It was a sad time in colonial history. We don't hold a grudge
against Salem but we do think there should be something there to
remember them (the victims).''
   Higley and Hay have overseen the design of a 14-foot, seven-ton
bronze statue of three of the accused witches _ Sarah Cloyce, Mary
Esty and Rebecca Nurse _ which they would like to see stand at the
Old Burying Ground in the heart of Salem.
   The city has not yet approved their proposed site, not far from
the grave of Magistrate John Hathorne, one of the chief hanging
judges who sentenced Esty and Nurse to death.
   The three women depicted in the statue were sisters, daughters of
William Towne of Topsfield.
   Nurse was in her early 70s when she was accused of witchcraft and
arrested. When her sisters, Cloyce and Esty, defended her, they also
were arrested and sentenced to death. Though Esty and Nurse were
executed, Cloyce was left to linger in prison.
   Cloyce was released in 1696. Magistrates of the crown, sent to
investigate the witch trials, presented her with three gold
sovereigns in memory of her two sisters and herself. She died three
weeks after leaving prison.
   Higley and Hay hope people viewing the statue will see the three
sisters _ and everyone else persecuted during the trials _ as real
people.
   ``It'll be the first time anyone has shown these people as real
human beings,'' Higley said.

   Hundreds of anti-abortion activists were arrested today outside
clinics in a nationwide wave of protests aimed at closing clinics or
persuading women to cancel abortion appointments.
   Nearly 700 arrests have been reported since demonstrations
started Friday.
   Atlanta police arrested about 40 people who blocked two entrances
to a clinic as about 100 supporters sang hymns and prayed. Some
demonstrators lay down in front of employees' cars arriving at the
clinic.
   The demonstration was generally peaceful. One protester was
handcuffed and arrested as he tried to stop a police motorcycle from
entering clinic property.
   Police today arrested about 140 people in and around New Orleans
and about 80 people in Falls Church, Va., where more than 400
protesters converged on a clinic. Four were arrested in Irvington,
N.J.; police in Columbus, Ohio, reported about 60 arrests.
   Police in New York today arrested 120 protesters outside a Deer
Park clinic that performs abortions. The Operation Rescue
anti-abortion group faced a $25,000 fine for blocking access to
local clinics. Another 100 people were arrested in Providence, R.I.
   In North Carolina, police arrested 55 protesters in Charlotte,
Chapel Hill and Raleigh. At least 40 arrests were reported in
Jackson, Miss. Arrests also were reported in Phoenix and Houston.
   In Brookline, Mass., acting Gov. Evelyn Murphy told a rally of
pro-choice demonstrators today that by voting for Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, they could protect
their right to a legal abortion.
   Nearly 200 people were arrested in four states Friday. The New
York-based Operation Rescue planned demonstrations in 32 U.S. cities
and said as many as 5,000 people could be arrested.
   Today's protests marked a continuation of the anti-abortion
campaign that has resulted in about 7,000 arrests nationwide in the
last five months. The campaign began in July during the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, and more than 1,200 people have been
taken into custody in 20 demonstrations in the Georgia capital since
then.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Bob Nolte said today's demonstrations
would be ``Atlanta-style.''
   Hundreds of demonstrators arrested in Atlanta have refused to
give their names or sign bail bonds, clogging the jail and court
systems and costing the city more than $500,000 in police overtime
and jail and court costs.
   Nolte, who runs a campus ministry at the University of Florida in
Gainesville, said Operation Rescue cannot control the tactics used
in the various cities, but he estimated there may be 4,000 to 5,000
arrests this weekend.
   The Atlanta demonstrations ``were a virus that infected and
caused great courage to come upon Christians around the United
States,'' he said.
   Friday's arrests were made in New York, Indiana, Tennessee and
Florida.
   Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry of Binghamton, N.Y., was
among about 80 demonstrators arrested at an abortion clinic in
Vestal, N.Y. His organization said he was freed on his own
recognizance.
   In Indianapolis, 40 protesters were taken into custody after they
blocked entrances to two women's clinics. Forty more were arrested
at two clinics in Nashville, Tenn.
   Police arrested 34 more at a clinic in Fort Walton, Fla., where
some demonstrators refused to walk to police buses and were carried.
   Most of those taken into custody were charged with trespassing.
   ``This is Smalltown, U.S.A., rising up against abortion,'' said
Jesse Lee, pastor of the Neighborhood Church in New York City.
   In New York City, protesters said they would defy a federal court
order against blocking entrances to abortion clinics that carries a
$25,000 fine. More than 600 Operation Rescue members were expected
to be arrested for blocking the entrances today, said Jesse Lee, an
organizer in Manhattan.
   The Texas Abortion Rights Action League also planned a rally
today in Austin. Phyllis Dunham, the league's executive director,
said the rally ``is meant to show just how much community support
there is for choice, and how little community support there is for
Operation Rescue.''
   Police officials in two areas expressed discomfort with arresting
anti-abortion activists but said they would do their duty.
   Okaloosa County, Fla., Sheriff Larry Golbert tried to persuade
demonstrators at the Fort Walton clinic to go on their own to the
buses.
   ``I'm not opposed to what these people stand for. I don't believe
in abortion on demand, but I have to do my job,'' he said.
   Atlanta Police Maj. Kenneth Burnette, criticized for rough police
tactics against demonstrators in early October, appeared at an
Operation Rescue meeting Friday night outside Atlanta and told a
crowd of 600 he had become a Christian shortly before joining the
police force 26 years ago. He said police would not use the rough
arrest tactics of previous demonstrations.
   ``I was not comfortable with that setting,'' he said of the
arrests, adding that he received a heavy load of hate mail ``from my
so-called brothers and sisters in Christ.''
   Michael Hirsch, the Atlanta director of Operation Rescue, told
the crowd: ``Out of courtesy we let him speak. But in no way do we
bow our knee to Caesar. Period.''

<HEAD>Staggering Problems Confront Soweto's Newly Elected Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newly elected city council
of Soweto, Johannesburg's main black township, faces hostile
constituents when it sets out to tackle its massive problems.
   Voted into office last week by less than 3 percent of the
township's 1 million adults, the council must deal with a 2-year-old
rent boycott and a 4-month-old strike by municipal workers.
   Thirty of the 35 incumbent councilors, including Mayor Nelson
Botile, were ousted in Wednesday's election. All but one of the 30
new councilors belong to the Sofasonke Party, headed by former mayor
Ephraim Tshabalala, a businessman. His son, Mbutana, is favored to
be selected by the new council as Botile's successor.
   But the 11{ percent voter turnout was so low the victors can
scarcely claim a mandate. Only 28,993 Sowetans disregarded a
nationwide boycott call from anti-apartheid leaders and voted in the
elections.
   The low turnout followed a multimillion-dollar government
advertising campaign in which cartoon-character squirrels urged
voters to ``Make It Happen.''
   The outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, in a
statement issued Saturday in Lusaka, Zambia, said blacks had
``rejected the apartheid local elections with contempt.'' It urged
newly-elected councilors to resign from their ``collaborative
structures ... and join the ranks of the people.''
   By law and custom, South Africa maintains a system of apartheid
under which its 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs,
which are controlled by the 5 million whites.
   The city council faces two major crises _ a widespread rent
boycott and a strike by municipal workers whose promised pay
increases have been delayed because of the boycott.
   The rent boycott started in a group of townships south of
Johannesburg in 1985 and spread to Soweto in June 1986. It was
launched to press a variety of political demands, including lifting
a national state of emergency, withdrawing security forces from
black townships and releasing political prisoners.
   Authorities have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in rent and
service fees during the boycott. An estimated two-thirds of Soweto's
households are withholding rent.
   In June, about 3,500 Soweto municipal workers went on strike,
irked by the postponement of pay increases and by demands that they
help break the rent boycott.
   About 2,000 strikers have been fired. Those who went back to work
are mostly office clerks and administrators.
   Services disrupted by the strike, such as garbage collection and
sewage-system repairs, have resumed on an irregular basis, but large
piles of trash line many of the unpaved streets.
   During the election campaign, Sofasonke leaders made sweeping
promises to rehire the strikers, improve services, lower rents and
halt evictions of rent boycotters.
   The Sowetan, the main daily newspaper in the township, attributed
the Sofasonke Party's success to support from ``the old, the
unemployed, the homeless and the sickly. The party's organizational
machinery saw to it that voters were well-fed and properly bused to
election posts.
   ``Whether the party fulfills its promises ... remains to be seen.
Black councilors still have a long way to go before being fully
accepted by residents.''

<TEXT>
   The biggest show of artistic treasure ever to
leave Japan _ including a 700-year-old portrait that is the nation's
equivalent to the Mona Lisa _ is taking over much of the National
Gallery of Art for the next three months.
   The ink and color portrait on a hanging silk scroll is of
Minamoto Yoritomo, the first of the shoguns _ military generals _
who ruled Japan in the emperor's name from 1185 until the great
changes in Japanese society following the arrival of the first
American fleet in 1859.
   One of 550 Japanese-owned works of art in the exhibit opening
here Sunday, the anonymous portrait of Yoritomo is designated a
``national treasure'' in Japan. J. Carter Brown, the National
Gallery's director, called it ``the Mona Lisa of Japanese art.''
   While Yoritomo was characterized in medieval military chronicles
as a brutal, ruthless warrior, the portrait of him attired in a
formal silk robe sitted on a mat represents him as courtly figure.
   Jumpei Kato, managing director of the Japan Foundation, said
Yoritomo, despite his reputation as a warrior, led a subdued
personal life.
   ``He had no concubines -- he was too afraid of his wife,'' Kato
said.
   Brown sees the exhibit, which has been five years in preparation,
as a way to help bridge the gap between the civilizations of the two
countries.
   ``These days there is no country more important than Japan to the
United States,'' he said.
   The final arrangments for bringing the exhibit to Washington were
made at a Tokyo conference of President Reagan and former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   The exhibit includes paintings, sculpture, screens, scrolls,
ceramics, textiles, door panels, swords, saddles, armor and other
objects usually associated with such showings.
   But the National Gallery also has built a stage in the main hall
of its East Building for the presentation of elaborately costumed
Noh _ ``talent'' translated in English _ dramas, the oldest form of
professional theater in Japan, dating back more than 500 years.
   The exhibit also includes a replica of a Japanese tea house, the
small thatched structures where members of the fuedal military
heirarchy engaged in a highly cultivated ritual of giving and
receiving tea as an act of social communion.
   During the exhibit, the huge metal mobile by American artist
Alexander Calder that normally swings from the ceiling and dominates
the East Hall, has been temporarily removed. Ruth Kaplan, a gallery
spokeswoman, said the mobile is being cleaned and would not have
interfered with the Japanese exhibit.
   The exhibit is expected to attract several visitors from Japan,
partly because the the elaborately but rarely staged Noh dramas
there and the gathering of so many other pieces of Japanese art into
one show.
   So many American visitors are expected that the gallery has set
up a system of reserving tickets for specific days and hours. The
tickets are free.
   The show is called ``Japan: the Shaping of Daimyo Culture
1185-1868.'' The daimyo were the great feudal lords who ruled Japan
under the shoguns. The exhibit will be on view until Jan. 23. It
will not travel to any other city.

<HEAD>EPA Too Busy To Study Radio Waves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency, citing the
press of other business, has suspended work on proposed standards
for exposure to radio waves, which some scientists suspect could
cause neurological damage in high doses.
   Rich Guimond, head of EPA's radiation programs, said in an
interview that the ``science is not strong enough right now'' to
justify further work on broadcast waves at a time when EPA is
swamped with other environmental problems.
   Guimond said growing concern about radon contamination of homes
and several court orders to re-work other standards have spread his
staff of about 150 people too thin to continue work on broadcast
standards.
   In addition, he said the agency is having to redraft regulations
for an underground nuclear waste repository, and is trying to come
up with guidelines for low-level nuclear waste repositories in the
states.
   William Hassinger, assistant bureau chief for engineering in the
mass media bureau of the Federal Communications Commission, said he
was ``terribly annoyed'' by EPA's decision because it ``makes it
more difficult for our licensees to operate efficiently.''
   There is no general standard that limits public exposure to
broadcast-frequency radiation.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, however, has a
workplace standard that uses a recommendation of the American
National Standards Institute. The FCC uses the same recommendation
in issuing broadcast licenses.
   The institute is a voluntary organization that recommends
standards of all kinds to be used by American industry.
   In recent years, some scientists have raised suspicion that some
people exposed to high electromagnetic fields might be suffering
damage to neurological and immune systems. In addition, high fields
can cause internal body heating, much like a microwave oven.
   EPA in 1986 sought public comment on whether to do nothing, to
uphold the institute's recommendation, or to adopt a standard five
or 10 times as strict.
   Portland, Ore., has already adopted a standard 10 times as strict
as the institute's recommendation. Massachusetts has chosen one five
times as strict.
   The toughest option would have meant 46 percent of the nation's
television and AM and FM radio stations would have had to make
changes such as operate at reduced power, fence in an antenna,
change radiation patterns or move an antenna.
   Currently, if communities or states object to radiation from an
antenna, the FCC refers to the institute's recommendation, Hassinger
said. But he said the FCC would rather have established guidelines.
   Guimond said EPA would not entirely abandon the field and could
resume work in a few years.
   During the current fiscal year, all but one or two of the seven
people working on the project will move to other areas. But first
they will draft a strategy of how those remaining should proceed at
EPA's Las Vegas, Nev., laboratory.
   They also will write a pamphlet of public advice and will finish
a review with EPA cancer experts of existing scientific studies of
possible links between low-frequency electromagnetic fields produced
by power lines and cancer in children, notably leukemia.
   Some studies have found a statistical association between
leukemia and residence near a power line; others have found nothing.

<HEAD>Islanders Prepare to Elect Palau's Third President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD GRAVES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KOROR, Palau (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven men, acutely aware that the post they
seek has been haunted by death, seek the presidency of this
politically and economically troubled Pacific island state in
national elections Wednesday.
   Each of the candidates for the four-year term has pledged to
bring unity, peace and reconciliation to the nearly 15,000 people
who live on eight of Palau's 200 islands.
   The world's last trusteeship, establised by the United Nations in
1947, Palau has been crippled by mounting debts, a U.S.
congressional investigation of alleged corruption and fiscal
mismanagement and deep divisions over a proposed compact with the
United States that would give Palau self-rule.
   Palau's only two elected presidents since constitutional
government began eight years ago died from assassination and suicide.
   The candidates include Thomas O. Remengesau, who became president
in August when Lazarus Salii died from a self-inflicted gunshot
wound.
   A longtime national government cabinet officer, Remengesau was
vice president and is serving the remainder of Salii's term, which
ends this year.
   All of the candidates support a new political status with the
United States, although they don't agree on the terms. The United
State has been administering Palau affairs under the trusteeship.
The candidates also advocate a stronger government role for the
island chain's 16 traditional chiefs.
   Three candidates, businessman Roman Tmetuchl, high chief Yutaka
M. Gibbons and John O. Ngiraked, minister of state in Salii's
cabinet, have sought the presidendy in previous elections.
   The other candidates are Santos Olikong, speaker of the national
House of Delegates; Moses Y. Uludong, a former national senator; and
Ngiratkel Etpison, a businessman.
   Etpison, Gibbons and Uludong are governors of their states, of
which Palau has 16.
   Because of the crowded field, it is unlikely that the winner will
receive a majority. There is no runoff under Palau's constitution.
   Final results may not be known for several days.
   The estimated 10,000 registered voters, including about 1,800 who
live outside Palau, also will elect 14 senators and 16 House members
to the national congress.
   ``Since the death of President Salii, everything is wide open,''
said one government official who asked to remain anonymous. ``There
is a new mood. Palau is at a juncture where the old ways are making
room for new approaches.''
   The official said most of the campaigning has been centered
around local issues such as road construction and service to the
villages.
   The proposed compact of free association would bring Palau
self-rule and hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. economic aid
once the trusteeship is terminated. Financial aid is now
administered by the Department of the Interior on a piecemeal basis.
Under free association, money would go to the Palau government to
spend as they see fit.
   A compact was approved by the U.S. Congress and President Reagan
in 1986 that would provide $460 million in aid over 15 years, but
Congress failed to act on a bill this month that would have provided
an extra $40 million as an incentive to get Palau to approve the
pact.
   Palauans have held six plebiscites since 1982, but each has
fallen short of approving the free association arrangement that is
similar to ones the United States has with two other former trust
territories, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of
Micronesia.
   Palau has a constitutional prohibition against nuclear weapons on
its territory. Each plebiscite won a majority but came up short of
the 75 percent support needed to overrule the no-nukes provision.
   Palau, west of the international dateline, is about 600 miles
east of the Philippines, 800 miles southwest of Guam and 4,500 miles
southwest of Honolulu.
   It is of strategic interest to the United States, which would
retain defense and mutual security responsibilities for the islands
under the proposed compact.

<HEAD>Pentagon Fraud Indictments To Begin After Election, Stretch Over
A
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors expect to bring the first
indictments in the Pentagon fraud and bribery scandal just one week
after the presidential election and may continue charging people for
up to a year. They won't rule out congressmen as targets of the
investigation.
   Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in suburban Virginia who is
running the multi-state, multi-agency investigation, is well aware
of whispers that the Reagan administration wanted charges delayed
until after Nov. 8 so that Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis wouldn't have them as ammunition against George Bush.
   ``Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to hand down
indictments in the first part of October,'' Hudson said in an
interview at week's end. Indeed, he and his bosses at the Justice
Department had predicted that kind of timetable last June when the
scandal broke with FBI raids on 44 sites coast-to-coast.
   But Hudson said complexity, not politics, pushed the time back.
This is the largest case his office has ever handled. His attorneys
and investigators have reviewed 700,000 documents and more are still
under subpoena to be turned over. They've listened to ``thousands
and thousands of tapes of two years' of telephone interceptions.''
   Prosecutors say the 2-year-old investigation into the $150
billion-a-year Pentagon procurement system has turned up evidence
that consultants, including some former high-level Reagan
administration officials and former high-ranking military men,
working for the nation's largest defense contractors bribed Pentagon
officials for information vital to winning contracts worth billions
of dollars. Five Pentagon employees have been transferred away from
contract work.
   Hudson's investigators have found foreign or offshore bank
accounts tied to some of the principals in the case, and he said
they are seeking foreign bank records _ ``always (a) delicate issue
and ... a time-consuming process.''
   Also government and defense sources, who won't allow use of their
names, indicate Hudson's men have been kept waiting for responses
from some potential defendants to offers of plea bargains.
   Hudson is using 15 attorneys, including some from the Justice
Department's fraud and public integrity sections, and 75 federal
agents, from the FBI, the Naval Investigative Service and the
Internal Revenue Service. They've been working 10 and 12 hours a
day, including weekends.
   In addition, he said, the federal judges of eastern Virginia,
known for moving cases quickly, impose a burden not found in other
federal jurisdictions. ``The very day the indictment is handed down,
our judges assume I am ready for trial, so ... I will not present
this indictment until we are ready for trial.''
   Now, Hudson said, ``I'm very optimistic on mid-November
indictments.'' Justice sources fix the date at Nov. 15, which
happens to be next day the grand jury meets.
   Hudson would only say that historically his office has kept
indictments below a dozen defendants. Justice sources expect even
fewer than that in the first round _ perhaps half a dozen
individuals.
   But Hudson conceded that charges against additional defendants
``could very well expand (for) a year, sure.''
   Hudson would not discuss the ownership or location of the foreign
bank accounts nor would he say what charges were contemplated. But
the presence of the IRS agents on his team indicates that tax
charges are being considered in addition to the more obvious counts
of theft of government property, bribery, fraud, conspiracy to
defraud the government.
   Court papers filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., indicate the prosecutors
are looking at allegations that campaign contributions were
extorted. Raids in New York came at the business of James Kane, who
set up the Long Island Aerospace Political Action Committee to make
contributions that might help area defense contractors, and at the
Long Island home of Dennis Mitchell, a Unisys Corp. official
identified as turning over contributions to Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md.,
who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. Dyson has denied any
wrongdoing.
   Dyson and several other congressmen were mentioned early in the
case, prompting Hudson to visit Capitol Hill. Members who attended
the closed meeting emerged saying that no congressman was a target
of the investigation.
   But ``I never made such a statement,'' Hudson said. ``I told the
members of the House of Representatives that no member of Congress
had been the subject of electronic surveillance, had received a
subpoena to testify in front of the grand jury at that time or had
been the subject of a search warrant.''
   In the last month, Hudson won full control of the case when
Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis told U.S. Attorney Andrew
Maloney in Brooklyn to step out of the case.
   Hudson denies _ and Maloney will not discuss _ reports they
argued over what priority to put on going after congressmen. Maloney
said, ``There were targets and players in both jurisdictions, but Ed
Dennis just decided he wanted to keep central control in Virginia.''
   Long Island also has been the site of alleged document
destruction, according to federal court papers. FBI agents told a
judge they overheard Kane ordering his employees to dispose of
documents after the initial FBI raids. Hudson would not say whether
that problem cropped up elsewhere.
   Court papers in Brooklyn show the government granted some
individuals immunity for their testimony.
   Hudson won't comment on the immunities or any plea bargain
negotiations. But one source said, ``They offered to let a guy in
his 60s plead guilty to a 20-year and a 15-year count. The lowest
I've heard is a guy with next-to-no involvement who was offered a
five-year sentence.''
   ``That's why they aren't getting many accepted, because they're
offering relatively hard deals.''
   Defense sources said they believed at least one deal may have
been agreed to, but federal sources would not confirm that.
   Federal sources, acknowledging they had initially expected more
targets would seek deals, said some individuals had rejected offers
of leniency in return for guilty pleas but others simply had not yet
responded to offers.
   One federal investigator, noting that anyone who pleaded guilty
now might spend Christmas in prison not at home, said, ``Going to
jail is like paying bills, if you can do it tomorrow instead of
today, you do it tomorrow.''

   A burglar who broke into a liquor store and downed
a $67 bottle of Dom Perignon before becoming stuck in the ceiling
during his getaway has been sentenced to three years in prison.
   ``It was the most expensive thing we had,'' store manager Don
Fiddler said of the wine. ``His excuse for taking the Dom Perignon
was that he couldn't find any cold beer.''
   Lawrence Nicholas Sansone, 21, became stuck in a hole in the
ceiling when his leg got wedged between two steel beams, said
prosecutor Diane Bull. He called out to police for help when they
responded to an alarm on Oct. 11.
   ``They could hear his muffled cry from the attic,'' Bull said.
``He was saying, `I'm stuck! I'm stuck!'''
   Firefighters had to pry the beams apart before Sansone could be
freed _ and arrested.
   Sansone pleaded guilty to burglary charges and was sentenced
Friday.

   The nation returns to standard time Sunday.
   The return occurs at 2 a.m., when clocks in most communities are
set back to 1 a.m.
   The switch provides an extra hour of sleep for many people,
restoring the hour lost last spring when daylight time was put into
effect.
   Daylight time returns at 2 a.m. Sunday, April 2, 1989.
   None of this applies, of course, in the few areas which do not
observe the time change _ Arizona, Hawaii, eastern parts of Indiana,
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa.

<HEAD>Reagan Votes For Bush; Blasts Dukakis</HEAD>

   President Reagan voted by absentee
ballot for George Bush Saturday, and continued his assault on
Michael Dukakis as the man ``wearing the liberal team's
tax-and-spend jersey.''
   Reagan, in his weekly radio address delivered from his
mountaintop ranch north of here, also said he and Bush have compiled
a solid record of accomplishment. ``I'll stack our record of
competence against any _ any day of the week.''
   Reagan said Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, would
undo the accomplishments the president claims for the administration.
   ``The leader of the other ticket says ideology doesn't matter,''
he said. ``But of course it does. He says he's on your side, but
he's wearing the liberal team's tax-and-spend jersey.''
   ``Maybe it's just that in the fourth quarter, with the two-minute
warning sounding, he wants you to think he's switched sides,'' said
the president. ``But he hasn't changed _ he hasn't changed his
ideas. ''
   ``Look at the record, and you can see who's on whose side,''
Reagan concluded.
   In the Democratic response to Reagan's address, Rep. Steny Hoyer
of Maryland accused Bush of waging a campaign ``drawn on fear, on
the lowest instincts, not on our highest hopes.''
   Praising Dukakis as a man with a vision for economic growth,
Hoyer drew one comparison between the Massachusetts governor and
Reagan.
   Dukakis is an ``optimist _ a leader in that respect like Ronald
Reagan. He sees what is best in Americans and how to make the most
of it for the best of America. That is the difference ... between
Gov. Dukakis and the vice president.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president and
First Lady Nancy Reagan marked their absentee ballots after the
radio speech at their five-room Spanish adobe ranch house. He said
the ballots would be hand-delivered to the registrar in Santa
Barbara.
   The Reagans flew by helicopter to the ranch from Santa Monica on
Friday after the president delivered a foreign policy address in Los
Angeles. They will return to Los Angeles Sunday to receive awards
from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a group that has worked to track
down Nazi war criminals.
   The president is to receive the humanitarian award and his wife
the museum of tolerance award.
   The president is expected to have private meetings and plan some
bills in Los Angeles on Monday.
   On Tuesday, he has campaign appearances scheduled in Fullerton
and San Bernardino, Calif., and Reno, Nev., before flying on to
Milwaukee to spend the night.
   After further campaigning in Milwaukee and Berea, Ohio, on
Wednesday, he will return to the White House.
   Fitzwater said one-day campaign trips are planned for Friday and
Saturday, but the locations have not yet been set.

   Foreign Ministers of the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact ended two days of talks Saturday after calling for a
35-nation European summit on reducing conventional weapons, official
reports said.
   Most of the proposals made at the meeting were contained in
previous documents issued by the military alliance, but the summit
call was new. There was no mention of who should attend the proposed
summit.
   In their declaration, the foreign ministers said measures worked
out in East-West negotiations should ``ultimately cover the activity
of all elements of armed forces _ ground, air and naval forces,''
the state news agency MTI reported.
   Since the United States and Soviet Union signed a treaty in
December to eliminate their intermediate-range land-based nuclear
weapons, military strategists and political leaders have shifted
attention to bolstering other forces.
   The United States and other NATO countries have long argued that
the nuclear deterrent is needed in Europe to offset a Soviet
advantage in conventional forces.
   Since the end of World War II, Red Army forces in Europe have
been dominated by huge armies of men, tanks and artillery suitable
for attack.
   The Pentagon estimates that the Soviets have 230 divisions,
compared with 121 for NATO. It also says the Soviets hold a
52,000-to-24,250 edge in battle tanks and a 42,000-to-18,350
advantage in artillery units. The seven Warsaw Pact countries and
the 16 members of the western North Atlantic Treaty Organization are
already laying plans for talks on conventional weapons to supplant
14 years of unsuccessful East-West negotiations in Vienna, Austria.
   It was not clear how the new Warsaw Pact proposal might affect
plans for the smaller 23-nation talks.
   The Warsaw Pact officials also proposed a string of East-west
confidence-building measures intended to make war less likely, MTI
said. They included broader prior announcement and curbs on military
maneuvers, talks on freezing or reducing military spending, and an
exchange of data on armed forces.

   A car dealership says it's getting no
respect from comedian Rodney Dangerfield _ and even less money.
   Miller Ford of Fairfield filed suit against Dangerfield Friday in
Bridgeport Superior Court, claiming the comedian still owes $51,000
on a customized van he bought in July.
   Dangerfield's lawyer, Peter Gillespie, says the star of
``Caddyshack'' and ``Back to School'' didn't buy the van.
   But the company maintains he ordered a customized 1988 ford Super
Cargo van and paid $10,000 toward the total price of $61,716.
   The dealership maintains that the van was delivered to
Dangerfield and that he wrote a check for the remaining amount on
July 21, but that he stopped payment on the check before it was
cashed.
   Matthew B. Woods, the dealership's lawyer, said his client wants
the remaining money plus interest. He said the case is no ``simple
misunderstanding'' and he expects it to be settled in court.

   In proceedings Friday that lasted less than 15 minutes, Judge
Ruthanne Polidori granted the petition filed by Holly Coors, on
grounds the marriage was ``irretrievably broken.''
   The couple's financial agreement was sealed by the court. When
the divorce petition was filed last year, Holly Coors said she was

   Bagian, who helped develope a new escape system for the shuttles,
told a group of 175 students at his alma mater, Drexel University,
that because space shuttles are research aircraft, accidents are
``the cost of doing business _ that's life.''
   Bagian, 35, is slated for Discovery's launch early next year. He
was scheduled on two earlier missions that were scrubbed after the
Challenger explosion in January 1986 that killed its seven crew
members.
   ``To paraphrase somebody else, `There ain't nothing routine about

   The ancient college clock chimed noon,
the race began and it was ``Chariots of Fire'' all over again.
   This time Sebastian Coe played winner Harold Abrahams and Steve
Cram was loser Lord Lindsey.
   Coe and Cram, two of Britain's most illustrious modern-day
athletes who have a stream of world records between them, staged a
high-noon charity run Saturday duplicating a piece of sports and
film legend.
   Watched by Prince Edward, youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II, and
approximately 1,500 other spectators, the two re-created the Great
Court Run of the film ``Chariots of Fire,'' racing the bells of
Cambridge's Trinity College.
   History says only one man ever before completed the college quad
circuit in the approximately 46 seconds it takes the clock-tower
bells to strike the 24 chimes that mark noon.
   In 1927, Lord Burghley accomplished the feat as a Cambridge
student and went on to win the Olympic 400-meter hurdles the
following year.
   Burghley was the model for the fictional Lord Lindsey character.
The film shows Lindsey outrun by Abrahams, who nips the nobleman at
the last chime.
   A well-maintained, modern running track it wasn't, but Coe and
Cram managed to keep their balance around the 367-meter circuit and
surged past the finish line Saturday just as the clock stopped.
   Coe ``crossed the line before the clock ceased chiming,'' said
Norris McWhirter, author of the Guinness Book of Records. He hailed
the winning time of 45.52 seconds as a record.
   Because of the crowd noise, which virtually obliterated the clock
chimes, there was doubt whether Cram also beat the clock.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan ridiculed White
House hopeful Michael Dukakis today, asserting the Democrat is
trying to make voters believe he's ``switched sides.''
   Referring to Dukakis only as ``a certain candidate for
president,'' Reagan said, ``He says he's on your side, but he's
wearing the liberal team's tax-and-spend jersey.''
   The president, on a week-long, cross-country campaign swing for
front-runner George Bush, devoted his weekly radio address to
attacking his vice president's opponent.
   Reagan poked fun at Dukakis' recent attempts to insert more
warmth and personality into his campaign with the slogan ``I'm on
your side.''
   ``Maybe it's just that at fourth quarter with the two minute
warning sounding, he wants you to think he's switched sides,''
Reagan said.
   ``But, he hasn't changed, he hasn't changed his ideas. Look at
the record and you can see who's on whose side,'' Reagan said.
   The president delivered the address from his mountain-top Rancho
del Cielo, where's he's taking a weekend respite with his wife,
Nancy.
   The couple planned to mark their absentee ballots later in the
day, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. The Reagans plan
to be in Washington on election day but are registered to vote in
California.
   Reagan asserted that Dukakis's argument that the 1988 election
battle against Bush is ``about competence, not ideology,'' doesn't
hold up.
   ``I'll stack our record of competence against any, any day of the
week,'' Reagan said, insisting that with Bush's aid, his
administration has been able to slash government bureaucracy and
lead the economy to a record of unparalleled prosperity.
   ``Yes, the leader of the other ticket says ideology doesn't
matter, but of course it does,'' Reagan said.
   ``We're now doing a much better job than has ever been done of
managing every single dollar that the government spends to make sure
it's spent in the very best way it can be,'' Reagan said.
   ``The government does all of its jobs better and faster,'' he
said.
   Reagan made no mention of the Pentagon mis-management scandal
over the overpayments of billion-dollar weapons systems.
   Instead, he pointed to the government's ability to cut the
paperwork for passports from 43 days to a 10-day waiting period, and
the waiting time for a Social Security card from seven weeks to 10
days.
   Reagan told a foreign policy group in Los Angeles Friday that he
is concerned not only about who will succeed him in the Oval Office,
but also whether Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will retain the
power to press ahead with his economic and political reforms.
   Reagan, in a question-and-answer session, offered a wide-ranging
_ and at times amusing _ commentary on the list of foreign policy
concerns that will be left to his successor three months from now.
   Responding to one query of how he felt about ``being replaced''
in the Oval Office, the president quipped, ``My concern is not just
replaced, it's who the replacement is _ and I have some very strong
feelings about that.''
   Reagan, who's spending several days in his home state rounding up
votes for his hand-picked successor, Vice President George Bush, got
a round of hearty laughter from the audience.
   The president went on to say that he didn't think any president
could step down ``without having things left undone, things that
you'd hoped could be accomplished, and so you leave hoping that they
will be then accomplished by someone else.''
   At another point, Reagan was asked whether he believed the new
Soviet drive toward economic prosperity and coexistance with other
nations would falter if Gorbachev were forced from power.
   The president replied that it would depend upon Gorbachev's
successor, but he also said he believed ``It would be a great
setback if anything happens to prevent him from continuing the
program that he has set forth.''
   Reagan, who has met four times with the Soviet leader, said he
believed Gorbachev has ``hurdled over Stalin,'' and has ``no respect
or regard ... whatsoever'' for the late Soviet dictator's
repressionist policies.
   Reagan contended that Gorbachev has ``gone back to some of the
teachings of Lenin,'' that he advocated ``working beside
capitalists'' and that Soviets could ``learn from them.''
   ``This man seems to have some ideas of that in mind. I hope that
he can continue and will continue on this path,'' Reagan said,
adding, ``The people in the street seem to be on his side.''
   On arms control, the president said a treaty cutting long-range
nuclear missiles ``is attainable in the next few years'' _ a
less-optimistic projection than in his recent speech to the U.N.
General Assembly, in which he said a treaty might be possible next
year.
   Reagan greeted with caution the Kremlin's announcement Thursday
that is it turning over its controversial radar installation at
Krasnoyarsk in Siberia to the Soviet Academy of Sciences for use as
a civilian-run international space research center.
   ``We are certainly listening to what they have to say,'' the
president said. ``But our legitimate concerns must be met.''
   The administration maintains that the radar installation is a
violation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. ``We have told the
Soviet Union that unless that violation is corrected in a verifiable
manner, we will not be able to conclude any new strategic arms
control agreements,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan said his term is ending at ``a portentous time'' in
East-West affairs, and called upon his successor to continue support
of Nicaraguan Contra rebels, aggressively pursue Star Wars defense
technology and maintain U.S. military strength.

   The chief witness for the prosecution at the
divorce-fixing conspiracy trial of former Miss America Bess Myerson
says she just wants to get at the truth.
   But Sukhreet Gabel's motives for testifying on the government's
behalf at a trial where her own aging mother is also a defendant
have confused and confounded the crowds watching the bizarre
courtroom drama.
   Ms. Gabel, 39, ended nine grueling days on the witness stand
Friday and told reporters outside federal court: ``I testified, but
I don't see it as testifying against my mother. I'm proud to
participate.''
   Her mother is former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel,
75, who is on trial with Miss Myerson, 64, and Miss Myerson's
boyfriend, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43, on charges of engaging in a
conspiracy to slash Capasso's temporary alimony payments to his
estranged wife.
   Miss Myerson, once the city's cultural affairs commissioner, is
accused of giving Ms. Gabel a $19,000-a-year city job to influence
her mother's decisions in Capasso's bitter divorce, in which Miss
Myerson was named co-respondent.
   Defense lawyers tried to portray Ms. Gabel as a neurotic,
resentful daughter who cooperated with prosecutors because of a
``deep-seated hatred'' of her parents.
   Even prosecutors conceded that a woman who records her own
mother's telephone conversation for the government may not be ``a
pretty picture.''
   But whatever her motives, short, round Sukhreet Gabel managed to
steal the spotlight from the glamorous Bess Myerson, who was voted
Miss America 1945.
   Camera crews and reporters waited outside the courthouse each day
to see what Ms. Gabel was wearing and to hear what she had to say.
   Inside the courtroom, Ms. Gabel testified that she had considered
suicide and sought treatment for clinical depression before Miss
Myerson gave her a job.
   She still takes anti-depression medication and conceded that
electro-shock treatments have turned her memory to ``Swiss cheese.''
   Ms. Gabel testified about deliberately recording a telephone
conversation with her mother for prosecutors. She also admitted
taking four satchels of her mother's papers to prosecutors without
her mother's knowledge and asking: ``Is this important?''
   The same day she admitted recording her mother, Ms. Gabel also
conceded that she deceived a grand jury ``to protect my mother.''
   Yet Ms. Gabel steadfastly maintained her mother's innocence.
   ``I don't believe you're guilty of a damn thing,'' she was heard
telling her mother on a tape played in court.
   During breaks in the proceedings, Mrs. Gabel, accompanied by her
81-year-old husband, Milton, a retired dentist, went up to the
witness stand to talk with her daughter, pat her hand and blow her a
kiss.
   ``I think she sounds charming,'' Mrs. Gabel told a reporter early
in her daughter's testimony.
   A defense lawyer accused Ms. Gabel of stealing the money her
parents gave her to pay rent and other expenses, noting that she was
once subject to eviction proceedings for being $3,000 behind in her
$800-a-month rent.
   When he asked what she did with the money, Ms. Gabel answered
melodramatically, ``I bought drugs,'' prompting gasps in the crowded
courtroom.
   Her mother got the lawyer to clarify that it was prescription
drugs her daughter bought. Ms. Gabel suffers from a thyroid
condition in addition to depression.
   Outside the courtroom, Ms. Gabel's comments were equally
outrageous.
   She talked to perfect strangers who called her apartment at all
hours, supporters, critics, prison inmates proposing marriage _ even
a radio personality who offered her a tryout as a ``contest girl''
on a rock station.
   ``I like talking to the interesting people who call,'' she told a
reporter.
   Ms. Gabel was asked by reporters how she could live with the
thought of testifying for prosecutors seeking to convict her own
mother.
   She replied: ``I can live with an overriding, overwhelming need
to get to the truth ... could it not be that this would establish
her innocence?''

<HEAD>Venice Launches Important Stage Of Flood Control Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS REDMONT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After decades of floods and heated debates
over how to deal with them, Italy on Saturday launched the first
stage of a $5 billion project to shelter the Venetian lagoon from
the high tides of the Adriatic Sea.
   Since its founding 1,100 years ago, Venice has been plagued by
frequent floods, water pollution and a steady sinking. The city has
dropped nine inches this century.
   After flood waters in 1966 inundated the famous St. Mark's Square
and damaged most of the old city, the government began studying how
to solve the problem.
   But the studies became bogged down in political infighting and
budgetary problems until three years ago, when the government came
up with a plan that includes construction of a line of mobile dikes
across the lagoon's three entrances.
   The barriers can best be described as giant jaws on the seabed
that will open when necessary to slow high tides rushing toward the
city. The rising ``jaw'' will drop back to the seabed as the tides
weaken and will remain invisible at normal times.
   Deputy Premier Gianni De Michelis inaugurated the first prototype
in a ceremony at the industrial section of Marghera. The steel dike
weighs 1,100 tons and has been dubbed ``Moby Duck.''
   For about a year, 24 hours a day, engineers will test the system.
   After the experiment is completed, 70 to 80 dikes similar to the
prototype, varying in length from 17 to 27 yards and up to 180 feet
high, will be built. The system is scheduled to be fully installed
in 1995.
   Other parts of the plan involve efforts to preserve the 150
canals, shore up the islands and the seawalls around the
cresent-shaped, 340-square-mile lagoon, and control pollution.
   ``For years this has been called a lagoon of debates. Now we
finally have action,'' De Michelis told a crowd Saturday at the
Metalotecnica yards where 26 Italian companies have combined to put
together the dike project.
   Members of the consortium supervising the project visited the
Thames river estuary and Holland's Schelda river, where similar
projects have been built.
   They also studied Chicago's work in cleaning up Lake Michigan and
looked to the San Francisco and Chesapeake bays to imitate their
organization in creating an overall authority to supervise the
project.
   Flood tides are triggered by differences in atmospheric pressure
at either end of the Adriatic or the sirocco wind that drives the
waters of the sea north.
   Flood tides have wreaked havoc in Venice as far back as the
Middle Ages, when one killed 1000 people in 1410. The great flood of
1966 caused an estimated $85 million damage.

   Here is the text of President
Reagan's weekly radio address, given from his West Coast residence,
Rancho del Cielo:
   My fellow Americans, not long ago, a certain candidate for
president said that this election is not about ideology, it's about
competence. I'd like to take a few moments to talk about competence
_ competence in the government and what we've done to improve it
over the last eight years.
   When George Bush and I arrived in Washington, we found a grossly
mismanaged federal government. To give you one example, in the last
year of the previous administration, federal spending was increasing
at the dizzying rate of 17 percent a year, which is, to say, almost
two times as fast as the economy as a whole.
   Now, with the cost of the government growing that fast, you'd
think those in charge would have been keeping track of exactly how
each dollar was spent. But in fact, at that time, the government did
not know until long after the fact how much was spent. And even when
it knew how much had been spent, it couldn't say for certain exactly
what it had spent your money on.
   This, together with excessive regulations, deteriorating
services, evidence of rampant waste, fraud, and abuse in a number of
agencies, pointed to a government that was too big and out of
control.
   Look at how we changed things. Start with excessive regulations.
We set up a task force headed by Vice President Bush. It's job:
identify and eliminate unnecessary federal regulations.
   The results: we've cut by over 600 million man hours a year the
time that businesses, state, and local governments, and you and I as
ordinary citizens, have to spend filling out federal forms and doing
other federal paperwork.
   This achievement has been even more important than many of us
realize. A leading historian has written that government
intervention and regulation was among the principle reasons for
America's economic stagnation in the '70s.
   Under George Bush's leadership, we lifted the weight of excessive
regulations, and that played a major role in getting our economy to
really fly.
   We also set up the private sector survey on cost control. Led by
Peter Grace, (with) almost 200 top business executives, this
commission spent months looking at every part of the government,
finding out where modern business practices could eliminate waste,
fraud, and abuse in the government.
   When they were through, they'd come up with 2,478 suggestions,
and almost every recommendation we could put into effect without
congressional action has been implemented. And we've saved close to
$80 billion.
   We're hoping that the next Congress will pitch in and do its part.
   Within the administration, we set up the council on integrity and
efficiency. Thanks to the council, the government has saved or put
to better use, over one hundred billion dollars in the past six
years.
   For example, it's put in computers so that we can now identify
bid-rigging contractors or catch con artists who take out loans from
many federal agencies and default on all of them. And, we've
initiated the largest management improvement program ever _ Reform
'88.
   By installing government wide cash, credit, financial, personnel,
payroll, and productivity systems, we've brought common sense to the
way we handle two trillion dollars that pass through the government
annually.
   Most of these improvements are now up and running right on
schedule, and the result is, that we're now doing a much better job
than has ever been done of managing every single dollar the
government spends to make sure it's spent in the very best way it
can be.
   As a result of our many reforms, the government does all its many
jobs better and faster. For example, in 1980, it took seven weeks to
get a social security card. Now, it takes ten days. It took 43 days
to get a passport, now it takes ten days. It took 75 days for an
export license, now it's five days to some countries, and no more
than 17 days for any. And, processing a claim for a Title One
Department of Housing and Urban Development loan, has dropped from
100 days to 22.
   Yes, the results speak for themselves, but there are other
results too. Results that show competence. These results include the
longest peacetime economic expansion on record. More new jobs
created than Europe and Japan combined, while cutting inflation to a
third of what it was, and interest rates in half.
   Come to think of it, I'll stack our record of competence against
any _ any day of the week. Because, you see, our ideas work and they
work for you.
   Yes, the leader of the other ticket says ideology doesn't matter,
but of course, it does. He says he's on your side, but he's wearing
the liberal team's tax and spend jersey. Maybe it's just the fourth
quarter; with the two minute warning sounding, he wants you to think
he's switched sides. But, he hasn't changed _ he hasn't changed his
ideas.
   Look at the record, and you can see who's on whose side. Until
next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

   A woman who fed her husband rat poison over
several years was placed on four years' probation after her
now-ailing husband pleaded with the judge not to send her to jail.
   ``If the victim doesn't want her put in jail, chances are she is
going to get probation,'' Dale County District Attorney David Emery
said Saturday, adding that he put up only ``token opposition'' to
the request.
   Judge Charles Woods imposed the sentence Friday on Flora
Crittenden, 47, who originally was charged with attempted murder but
pleaded guilty to assault in an agreement with prosecutors.
   Her husband, James Crittenden, 46, had made a living as a logger
and was in good health before the poisoning started, Emery said.
``Her husband forgave her before he even got out of the hospital,''
the district attorney said.
   During a hearing last month, the husband told the judge the
couple had been married 28 years. ``If I ever needed her, I need her
now,'' said Crittenden, who now uses a walker to get around. ``I
can't even make it to the bathroom now.''
   Authorities have said a life insurance policy on Crittenden was a
possible motive in the poisoning.
   Sheriff Bryant Mixon has said Mrs. Crittenden poisoned her
husband by putting arsenic in his food and drinking water. He said
his department was notified after Crittenden's doctor detected a
high level of arsenic in him.
   Mixon said Crittenden had refused to sign a warrant for Mrs.
Crittenden's arrest, so his department signed it. She has been free
on bail since her arrest in May.
   A neighbor, Dewey Williams, had expressed surprise at the case,
saying he thought the couple were as ``close as two black-eyed peas
in one hull.''

   A masked assailant believed to be a Basque
separatist shot and killed a police officer Saturday in this
northern city, police said.
   The gunman got out of a car about 500 feet from a police station
and shot Cristobal Diaz Garcia in the chest as he stood guard just
after 10 a.m., police said.
   No group claimed responsibility, but police said it appeared to
be the work of the Basque separatist group ETA.
   Authorities said a witness told police the sniper and another
armed and masked man fled in a car driven by a woman. Police found
the car abandoned about five miles from the scene, they said.
   Garcia, 36, was taken to a hospital and died in surgery, police
said.
   The ETA group seeks independence from Spain for the northern
Basque region and the neighboring Navarre region. Since taking up
arms in 1968, the group has claimed responsibility for killing more
than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers.
This year, it has claimed 13 kiilings.

   After four nights in jail, the city's chief legal
officer gained his freedom by releasing documents relating to a $42
million land deal.
   The records indicate the city got back only $1.7 million when it
auctioned off used machinery valued at $35.8 million inside three
warehouses it purchased, according to stories Saturday in Detroit
newspapers that had sought the documents.
   Detroit Corporation Counsel Donald Pailen left the Wayne County
Jail Friday after lawyers in the case met with Circuit Judge James
Rashid and agreed to give up the records.
   That meeting followed an announcement by the Michigan Supreme
Court that the justices voted 6-1 against hearing Pailen's appeal.
   The documents, sought under a state Freedom of Information
request by the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News, concerned
the city's efforts to assemble 637 acres for a planned plant
expansion by Chrysler Corp. The city paid $42.1 million for 15 acres
of land, the three warehouses and the used machinery.
   ``We're very pleased because the courts all the way up the line
have supported our contention that the records are a matter of
public record,'' News Executive Editor Robert H. Giles said. ``The
rulings also sent a strong message to City Hall about its obligation
to keep the public informed.''
   Pailen said he had no regrets about going to jail.
   ``I believe as strongly today as I did Monday ... that the legal
principle I came here for was worth spending the time in jail,'' he
said.
   The machinery purchase is under investigation by a federal grand
jury, which has subpoenaed many of the same records sought by the
newspapers.
   Mayor Coleman Young contended the documents shouldn't be released
because it might hamper the grand jury probe.
   Pailen was jailed Monday on a contempt of court charge for
defying Rashid's order to hand over the records to The News, which
sued to obtain the documents.

<HEAD>Seven Latin Presidents Pledge To Work Together for Debt Relief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven South American presidents
pledged Saturday to devise a common strategy to persuade creditors
to write off part of their $339 billion foreign debt.
   The leaders also called for a new dialogue on regional issues
with richer, industrialized countries. They said they would seek
meetings with U.S. government officials to coordinate efforts to
curtail drug trafficking and end wars in Central America.
   ``It is our intention to initiate a new dialogue with developed
nations in the search for a system of more equal relations,'' the
presidents said in a communique at the end of a three-day summit.
   They discussed mainly foreign debt since arriving Wednesday at
this posh Atlantic resort.
   ``The problem of the debt has become the main obstacle to growth
in our region, given the massive net outflow of resources to the
industrialized nations,'' the communique stated. It said interest
paid on the debt siphons money from needed domestic projects and
services.
   Seven countries _ Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Peru,
Venezuela and Uruguay _ came to the conference of nations, known as
the Group of Eight. The eighth member, Panama, was suspended from
the group after its military chief, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
deposed the civilian president, Eric Delvalle, in February.
   Delvalle sent a letter to summit host President Julio M.
Sanguinetti saying he was willing to relinquish his claim to office
if it would bring about early, fair elections in Panama. However,
Delvalle said he doubted the integrity of any balloting administered
by Noriega, who has called elections for May.
   All the nations at the summit have had difficulty repaying their
debts. They all have suffered economic or social upheaval for years:
triple-digit inflation in Argentina and Brazil, budget shortfalls in
Venezuela and Mexico, guerrilla insurgencies in Colombia and Peru,
and a stagnant economy in Uruguay.
   ``Our region is confronted by the gravest (economic) crisis in
its history,'' said Uruguay Foreign Minister Luis Barrios Tassano,
who read the group's communique to diplomats and invited guests in a
municipal gymnasium.
   ``The stability and economic and social development of Latin
America is threatened by the grave economic problems of the debt and
the unfavorable evolution of international trade,'' Barrios Tassano
said. ``The development of our nations should be an objective shared
with countries that are highly developed.''
   The communique provided only a sketchy framework of a plan for
debt forgiveness. Finance ministers will meet before year's end in
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to flesh it out.
   However, Brazil's finance minister, Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega,
said Friday the nations would continue to negotiate on their own,
not as a cartel.
   A U.N. Conference on Trade and Development recommended last month
that creditor banks and governments forgive 30 percent of the debt
owed by 15 of the most heavily indebted nations, including all seven
at the conference.
   On drug trafficking, the presidents said they would continue
programs of crop eradication and seizure. They urged industrialized
nations to fight consumption of cocaine and marijuana and laundering
of money from the illegal sale of the drugs.
   ``The production, illegal trafficking, and use of narcotics ...
is assuming proportions that affect the stability of institutions in
some of our countries,'' the communique stated.
   The Group of Eight traces its roots to the 1983 joint effort by
Mexico, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela to promote a political
solution to civil wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Peru,
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay joined that effort in 1985, and the
eight countries decided a year later to meet regularly to discuss
regional issues.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Soviets May Have Violated Afghan Withdrawal Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets may have violated a troop
withdrawal agreement by deploying up to 30 high-performance ground
support warplanes in Afghanistan, U.S. officials said Saturday.
   Afghan guerrillas who are battling the Kremlin-backed Kabul
regime say the Soviets have based two squadrons of MiG-27 Flogger-D
close air support fighters at Shindand, 100 miles south of Herat in
far western Afghanistan near the Iranian border, said one official.
   The MiG-27s are suited for offensive operations, whereas the
Soviet Union has said that it would undertake military operations in
Afghanistan only to protect its own troops from attack.
   ``We are investigating,'' said one U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Certainly, the introduction of offensive
equipment into Afghanistan could be viewed as a violation of the
agreements. But there are legal technicalities in every agreement.''
   Under the Geneva withdrawal accords signed last spring, the
Soviets are obliged to pull out their entire occupation force, once
estimated at 115,000 troops.
   Soviet officials have said the withdrawal timetable was
jeopardized by continued U.S. and Pakistani support for resistance
units, who are operating with increasing boldness deep inside
Afghanistan, launching repeated rocket attacks on the capital.
   A second State Department official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the MiG-27s are believed to have replaced two
squadrons of older MiG-23 Flogger fighters. Each squadron has 12-15
planes, according to David Isby, author of ``Russia's War in
Afghanistan.''
   The U.S. official repeated the Reagan administration formula on
Afghanistan that ``we still expect the Soviets to be out by Feb.
15,'' as called for under the Geneva accords.
   The New York Times, which reported the presence of the MiG-27's
in Saturday's editions, quoted an unidentified U.S. official
predicting the Soviets might resume offensive operations in
Afghanistan.
   The presence of the MiG-27s was reported by resistance units
fighting in the area and has not been confirmed independently by
U.S. diplomats, who are restricted largely to Kabul, the Afghan
capital. The Times quoted officials as saying the sighting was
confirmed by satellite photos.
   The Soviets have had two or three squadrons of MiG-23 warplanes
in Afghanistan since at least 1984, and may have had MiG-27's there
as well, according to Isby.
   The MiG-23 and MiG-27 use the same basic air frames, but the
forward fuselage, air intakes and weapons mounts of the MiG-27
enable it to carry air-to-ground missiles and maneuver at subsonic
speeds to support ground forces, according to ``Jane's All The
World's Fighting Aircraft,'' an authoritative reference.
   Earlier this week, the chairman of the Afghan resistance
alliance, Burhanuddin Rabbani, said the Soviets were deploying new
high-altitude Tu-16 bombers in Afghanistan. The Times said State
Department officials denied that assertion.

<TEXT>
   A 20-year-old woman from Rome served as a
surrogate mother for her own mother, Italian newspaper said, and the
Vatican on Saturday called the case ``unacceptable experimentation.''
   Newspapers have reported that the younger woman recently gave
birth to a boy at a Rome hospital after carrying to term the
artificially fertilized egg of her 48-year-old mother. The sperm of
the daughter's 35-year-old stepfather was reportedly used to
fertilize the egg.
   The recent reports have touched off a debate in medical and
religious circles over the ethical questions raised. Some doctors
and scientists have expressed doubt that the episode occurred.
   The daily La Stampa of Turin reported that the stepfather wanted
his own children, but that his wife, already the mother of the
20-year-old and two other children, had been advised against further
pregnancies.
   The family discussed the matter with a gynecologist, and the
daughter volunteered to ``lend'' her womb to her mother, the paper
said without citing sources.
   Newspaper reports have not identified the people involved or said
exactly when the child was born.
   The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano criticized the people
involved and called the case ``unacceptable experimentation that
kills the dignity of the person.''
   The newspaper cited a document on respect for human life by
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a Vatican official in charge of the
Congregation for Doctrine of the Faith.
   ``What happened in these days is a consequence of not accepting
that from a moral point of view, responsible procreation must result
from a conjugal act. If separation of procreation from the conjugal
act is permitted, conception becomes a question of mere technical
reproduction. And terms such as conjugal love, maternity and
procreation become meaningless,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.
   ``The girl was painfully used as an object; she was used for nine
months as an incubator, a prisoner of the egotism of the mother and
of the detestable techniques. She killed her dignity as a woman. She
definitely injured her personal future,'' the newspaper said.

   Here is the Democratic response to President
Reagan's weekly radio address, given by Rep. Steny Hoyer.
   Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, I'm Steny Hoyer, a
congressman from Maryland, a Democrat and for the next few minutes,
your guest and my party's spokesman.
   On this weekend as Americans reset their clocks to standard time,
we all get a small bonus, an extra hour in the day. Let me ask you
to use your precious 60 minutes for some calm, reasoned thinking
about the choice you will make 10 days from now, a choice that could
shape our lives for the next four years and beyond.
   It is a choice between honorable, experienced, decent men, Mike
Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, or George Bush and Dan Quayle.
   It is a crucial choice, but because the campaign has often been
distorted and confusing, it is not an easy choice. Many of you I
know are angry at what you've seen and heard. Many of you are
uncertain, not just about how to vote, but whether to vote and what
to expect of your future.
   One candidate has, in my opinion, defined his priorities and
America's goals, and he has a track record of delivering on his
promises.
   Michael Dukakis has spelled out a mainstream program for a main
street America. He has told us how he can create jobs at wages that
families can live on, jobs that will last so that families can build
on them.
   Mike Dukakis has shown us how to reach for excellence in
education and how to share the costs of improving our skills and
expanding our children's horizons. He has put forward a national
plan for a national need, comprehensive health insurance, and he's
shown us how to finance it.
   Mike Dukakis has given us a battle plan for a clean environment
and a way to make polluters pay for the pure air and safe water that
we cannot afford to live without.
   Mike Dukakis has also laid out an affordable strategy for
American security in a dangerous world, a sensible combination of
arms and arms control. He will choose the weapons we need, not just
sign off on the Pentagon's wish list and the defense contractors'
cost overruns.
   And while we rebuild our military forces in the field, we will
regain our economic clout.
   Just as we cannot let other nations hold our destiny hostage to
our debts, we cannot let our trading partners close off their
markets while they have a field day in ours.
   Mike Dukakis understands that the Soviet challenge is not the
only one we face. He will lead America into economic competition,
forward again into first place in the global marketplace.
   Above all, Governor Dukakis has pointed the way to a stronger
America, to a society that is fair and caring, to a nation that is
competent and on the move.
   He's an optimist. He sees what is best in Americans and how to
make the most of it for the best of America. That is the difference,
I suggest to you, between Governor Dukakis and the Vice President.
   George Bush is no Ronald Reagan. George Bush has not voiced our
dreams. He has played on our nightmares. George Bush's campaign is
drawn on fear, on the lowest instincts, not on our highest hopes. He
has told us what he is against, not what he is for. If he has an
agenda for the future, he's kept it hidden.
   I do not think that is the way you should win elections. I know
that is not the way you should govern America. Scaring Americans,
deceiving them, dividing them, only makes it harder to lead us
forward to bring us together.
   Mike Dukakis has given America a vision which brings us together.
His program for economic growth does not promise new benefits for
those at the top of the economic ladder, rather it promises hard
work and a fair shake for Americans in the middle and on their way
up.
   It promises security and dignity for those whose working years
are past, and it promises a bright future, full of challenge and
reward for the young who are the hope of the future.
   So the choice is clear, the choice between positive values and
negative advertising, between leadership with conscience and
salesmanship without substance. I again ask you to use your extra
hour to reflect on that choice once more, to put aside the shrill
sound bites, the slick commercials and the frantic polling and to
decide with your common sense and your decency about our common
future.
   Democrats believe the best in America is the best in the world
and we believe the best America is yet to come. It is your choice to
make soon, to make wisely as Americans do. Let your conscience and
our future will be enriched.
   Good afternoon, and God bless you.

   President Reagan voted by absentee
ballot for George Bush Saturday, and continued his assault on
Michael Dukakis as the man ``wearing the liberal team's
tax-and-spend jersey.''
   Reagan, in his weekly radio address delivered from his
mountaintop ranch north of here, also said he and Bush have compiled
a solid record of accomplishment. ``I'll stack our record of
competence against any _ any day of the week.''
   Reagan said Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, would
undo the accomplishments the president claims for the administration.
   ``The leader of the other ticket says ideology doesn't matter,''
he said. ``But of course it does. He says he's on your side, but
he's wearing the liberal team's tax-and-spend jersey.''
   ``Maybe it's just that in the fourth quarter, with the two-minute
warning sounding, he wants you to think he's switched sides,'' said
the president. ``But he hasn't changed _ he hasn't changed his
ideas. ''
   ``Look at the record, and you can see who's on whose side,''
Reagan concluded.
   In the Democratic response to Reagan's address, Rep. Steny Hoyer
of Maryland accused Bush of waging a campaign ``drawn on fear, on
the lowest instincts, not on our highest hopes.''
   Praising Dukakis as a man with a vision for economic growth,
Hoyer said the Democratic presidential candidate ``has spelled out a
mainstream program for Main Street America.''
   In prepared remarks released before he delivered his radio
speech, Hoyer said Dukakis is an ``optimist _ a leader in that
respect like Ronald Reagan.'' But Hoyer dropped the comparison when
the speech was aired.
   Speaking of Dukakis, Hoyer said, ``He sees what is best in
Americans and how to make the most of it for the best of America.
That is the difference ... between Gov. Dukakis and the vice
president.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president and
First Lady Nancy Reagan marked their absentee ballots after the
radio speech at their five-room Spanish adobe ranch house. He said
the ballots would be hand-delivered to the registrar in Santa
Barbara.
   When asked how the president was voting, Fitzwater said only,
``By secret ballot.'' From his campaigning for Bush, however, it was
clear Reagan would vote for his party's nominee.
   The Reagans voted by absentee ballot because they will be in
Washington on election day, Nov. 8.
   The weather at the ranch was sunny and warm. Fitzwater said the
Reagans were going horseback riding and the president was attending
to paperwork and routine ranch chores.
   The Reagans flew by helicopter to the ranch from Santa Monica on
Friday after the president delivered a foreign policy address in Los
Angeles. They will return to Los Angeles Sunday to receive awards
from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a group that has worked to track
down Nazi war criminals.
   The president is to receive the humanitarian award and his wife
the museum of tolerance award.
   The president is expected to have private meetings and sign some
bills in Los Angeles on Monday.
   On Tuesday, he has campaign appearances scheduled in Fullerton
and San Bernardino, Calif., and Reno, Nev., before flying on to
Milwaukee to spend the night.
   After further campaigning in Milwaukee and Berea, Ohio, on
Wednesday, he will return to the White House.
   Fitzwater said one-day campaign trips are planned for Friday and
Saturday, but the locations have not yet been set.

   Lloyd Bentsen pulled on his cowboy
boots and voted in this south Texas town Saturday, urging local
residents to take advantage of a new state law that allows early
absentee voting without requiring a reason.
   ``Get your friends and neighbors out to vote. Don't wait until
Nov. 8,'' he told a crowd of about 200 he addressed after voting at
the Starr County Courthouse.
   ``You don't know what the weather is going to be. You don't know
how things are going to be on the job'' or if there will be long
lines at the voting booth, he said. ``Let's do it early.''
   A Texas law passed last year has allowed people to cast absentee
ballots since Oct. 19 and until Nov. 4, without having to claim
they'll be away on Election Day.
   Bentsen and his wife B.A. filled out their paper ballots and
stuffed them in a box in a small courtroom packed with reporters and
television cameras. Asked afterward how he voted, Bentsen said
people could count on him voting for himself, but added, ``I'm not
supposed to electioneer within 1,000 feet'' of the polling place.''
   Mike McCurry, Bentsen's press secretary, joked that if the
cameras missed the shot, ``We'll be glad to vote two, three, four
times.''
   The county, on the Mexican border, is 96 percent Hispanic, and
Bentsen spoke in both English and Spanish.
   ``Vote the straight ticket,'' Bentsen onlookers in Spanish, as
car horns blared approval.
   The new absentee voting law has proved so popular that some Texas
election officials have speculated that as much as one-fourth of the
vote could be done that way. Bentsen's use of the statute was
designed to help Democratic officials in their effort to boost voter
turnout among blacks and Hispanics.
   Bentsen has been projecting an unusually high profile for a vice
presidential candidate, as the Democratic campaign seeks to contrast
him with Republican Dan Quayle and use him to vouch for Dukakis on
conservative issues.
   The campaign released to reporters on Saturday the five-minute
television commercial featuring Bentsen which will air on the ABC
network Sunday night. The spot is the first by a presidential
campaign to feature the running mate.
   In the commercial, Bentsen says the campaign this year has been
``absolutely miserable.''
   ``You've been told that Mike Dukakis will take away your gun.
That's just not true,'' Bentsen says.
   ``You've been told that Mike Dukakis is in favor of letting
criminals loose in the streets. That's outrageous, and it's sure not
true,'' he says.
   ``You've been told that Governor Dukakis and I oppose virtually
every major weapon system important to our national security,'' he
says. ``That's certainly not true ... and I wouldn't be on the
ticket with a fella if he didn't believe that America must be the
strongest nation on earth.''
   Also Saturday, Bentsen taped an appearance on the Cable News
Network's ``Newsmaker Sunday'' program. While continuing to attack
the Republican campaign, he also defended a Democratic ad.
   Bentsen, who said a Republican commercial _ made by an
independent organization not connected with the Bush campaign _ that
focused on a black man who raped a white woman was racist, said a
Democratic ad featuring a Hispanic criminal was not.
   ``I don't think so at all,'' he said. ``In that instance, we were
not using the name ... and it was a direct response to the kind of
an attack that was made on us,'' he said.
   ``These kinds of things should not be part of the campaign,'' he
added.
   Bentsen's father, Lloyd Bentsen Sr., accompanied him to Rio
Grande City but did not vote himself. The elder Bentsen's residence
is in neighboring Hidalgo county.
   ``I can't vote in Starr County,'' he quipped, ``But if nobody's
watching, I will.''

   Police and riot squads patrolled
Wenceslas Square and the area around it Saturday to prevent an
unauthorized rally, one day after another rally was broken up with
tear gas and water cannons.
   Authorities said 87 people were detained after Friday's
demonstration, but most were believed to have been freed. Police
moved in after about 5,000 people, at an unauthorized rally marking
the 70th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's independence, refused to
disperse.
   Helmeted riot police with batons and shields fired water cannons
and tear gas at the crowd.
   Western reporters saw police beating some of those detained and
spraying water indiscriminately, hitting a blind man and a woman
with a baby in a stroller.
   Witnesses said it was the most brutal police action since 1969
when police dispersed tens of thousands of people protesting on the
first anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. Two
people reportedly died.
   Saturday's rally had been called by an independent peace group
and by Czech Children, a small unofficial youth group.
   Uniformed police checked identity cards of dozens of people near
the planned meeting point in Wenceslas Square and asked any group
larger than about six people to move on and break up.
   Plainclothesmen filmed Western correspondents. Uniformed police
repeatedly checked identity cards of Western diplomats on the
square, a half-mile long avenue in central Prague.
   At the bottom of the square, buses blocked streets leading to
nearby Old Town Square and helmeted riot police with truncheons
barricaded the area.
   Prague Communist party boss Miroslav Stepan was seen walking in
Wenceslas Square, apparently checking security.
   There were at least two dozen police buses, trucks and water
cannons parked on streets close to the two squares.
   Anna Sabatova, a signatory of the Charter 77 human rights
document and a leading activist from the Committee for the Unjustly
Prosecuted, said about 70 dissidents rounded up Thursday and Friday
were still in detention.
   She said that Augustin Navratil, a Roman Catholic activist who
authored a petition for religious freedom earlier this year, was
taken from his home in central Czechoslovakia on Friday night by two
policemen and two doctors.
   Navratil was taken to a nearby psychiatric clinic where he
previously had been ordered to report, she said.
   Witnesses to Friday's rally said it was not confined to Wenceslas
Square. They said several hundred demonstrators forced off the
square by police marched to the Old Town Square.
   There, a document from the Charter 77 human rights movement was
read to the crowd before baton-wielding police and special troops
from the Ministry of the Interior again moved in with water cannons
and large armored vehicles, one witness said.
   This account, by a woman who spoke on condition of anonymity, was
read to Western reporters by Sabatova.

   George Bush wants to drive his own car into
political retirement if he doesn't win the White House, but his wife
says she's not riding with a man who hasn't taken the wheel in years.
   As vice president, Bush doesn't drive but rides in cars driven by
others. Mrs. Bush joked on Saturday that the only driving he's done
in eight years is in the driveway.
   She said it has become a family joke, Bush saying that if he
should lose the election, they should drive away together.
   She told reporters that she'd replied ``You're going to drive

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, who has
encouraged arms sales to some Arab countries, met Saturday with King
Hussein to discuss military cooperation.
   Carlucci, who arrived here Friday, held lunch talks with Hussein
at his palace.
   The defense secretary then led the American delegation at a
meeting of the Jordanian-American Joint Military Commission. Prime
Minister Zaid Rifai and the army's commander in chief, Field Marshal
Zeid bin Shaker, led the Jordanian delegation.
   The two sides ``reviewed issues of mutual concern and means of
cooperation'' and discussed ``the general situation in the region,''
according to the official Petra news agency.
   The committee oversees the use of about $50 million in U.S.
military aid. Jordan's 70,000-member military, which trains some of
its troops in the United States, participates in maneuvers with
American forces and uses American tanks, artillery, anti-aircraft
missiles and fighter planes.
   Jordan has begun to reduce its heavy military reliance on the
United States after Congress refused to upgrade weapons systems to a
level competitive with those used by Israel, Syria and other
neighboring countries.
   In 1986, Congress blocked a proposed $1.9 billion sale of jet
fighters and anti-aircraft weapons to Jordan, and Hussein vowed
never again to seek major U.S. weapons systems.
   The king has continued to encourage U.S. efforts to solve the
Arab-Israeli conflict. Hussein, however, has insisted that the
Palestine Liberation Organization must approve or take part in any
peace negotiations.
   Carlucci said in a speech last week that U.S. arms sales to
moderate Arab governments would help make them secure enough to
welcome efforts to negotiate peace with Israel.
   He also warned that as a result of rejection of arms sales to the
Arabs, countries such as Great Britain, France, China, and the
Soviet Union ``are moving into the highly desirable positions of
confidence and influence which America has traditionally enjoyed.''

   Cathy May Sliker says she doesn't know who
stole a 2{-foot pumpkin from the front porch of her home, but it had
to be more than one person.
   That's because her pumpkin weighed 246 pounds _ just a dozen
pounds less than Aaron Jones, first-round pick of the Pittsburgh
Steelers football team.
   Mrs. Sliker, who lives in rural Wolfs Corner, said she and a
friend had to use a wheelbarrow to load the pumpkin from the home of
another friend to her home. She used a bathroom scale to determine
the pumpkin's weight.
   Her four children had planned to carve the pumpkin into a
jack-o'-lantern and put a flashlight inside to display it for
Halloween.
   She said the pumpkin was stolen sometime between 5 p.m. and 8
p.m. Thursday, while she was taking her children to a barber shop.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush criticized Michael Dukakis
on Saturday for casting the race in class terms and said, ``I am not
going to let that liberal governor divide this country.''
   Bush, a political commuter working to turn out the Republican
vote in the city's far suburbs, said Illinois is crucial to his
quest for the White House.
   It was his fifth Republican presidential trip in Illinois and he
said ``I shall return next week to do whatever it takes to win this
key state.''
   Illinois, with its 24 electoral votes, is a battleground state
among battlegrounds. By Republican electoral arithmetic, there's no
way Dukakis can upset their man without Illinois in the Democratic
column.
   So on Saturday, Bush and his wife, in an entourage that included
Gov. James Thompson and singers Crystal Gayle and Moe Bandy, took a
six-stop, 150-mile bus tour from the far edges of metropolitan
Chicago into two Republican precincts in the Democratic city itself.
   Bush, in leather jacket and blue western-style shirt, vowed at
each stop to campaign without letup, ``every inch of the way,'' and
asked his supporters to do the same.
   ``I urge you to go that extra mile to get that vote out,'' Bush
urged precinct workers gathered outside a farmhouse in West Dundee.
   He told a rally at McHenry County College in Crystal Lake that
Dukakis is a divisive candidate, while ``I'm going to bring it
together... I am not going to let that liberal governor divide this
country,'' he said. Bush said Dukakis is trying to depict him as an
elitist, and to divide the electorate on class lines.
   ``I'd hate to be my opponent, dragging myself around this
country, trying to convince Americans that everything's going to
hell in a handbasket,'' Bush said.
   He even summoned two trapped grey whales, since freed, to his
campaign cause. ``I sympathize with them, trapped up there in
Alaska,'' said Bush. ``That's what America looked like back in 1980.
Trapped in there, trying to get out.
   ``And now we've strengthened the military, brought the economy
back,'' he said. ``I only hope for those whales that they don't end
up in Boston Harbor. They think they've got troubles in Alaska.''
   In Plainfield, at an operating engineers' union training center
and at a rally at Joliet Junior College, Bush ran the litany of his
basic campaign speech _ no new taxes, no gun controls, support for
the death penalty, a strong national defense.
   At the Plainfield stop, Bush received the endorsement of Local
150 of the International Union of Operating Engineers. The campaign
issued a statement saying that 30 prominent labor officials had
endorsed Bush on Saturday.
   Along the way, Bush stopped to buy a Halloween pumpkin for his
grandson, George P. Bush. It would have cost $6.50, but the stand
operator wouldn't take money from the vice president.
   Barbara Bush, meanwhile, rode the press bus and told reporters
she does not like negative campaigning _ which she blamed on the
Democrats.
   While she said she doesn't like the tone of the campaign, she
also said ``I'm absolutely convinced that George Bush is doing no
mudslinging. ... I think he's taken a very high road.''
   She said neither she nor Bush thinks the election is won, and
that they both expect to see it tighten in the final days.
   ``Does he think the thing's in the bag? No. Remember, the first
vote he and I ever cast was for Dewey,'' Mrs. Bush said.

   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) dedicated
new headquarters Saturday and celebrated the coming together of the
church, split over a century ago into two parts.
   And a South African religious leader called on those attending an
ecumenical worship service to be more active in the fight against
apartheid, or racial segregation.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, said churches can no longer be content only to
speak against injustice and racial bigotry.
   ``If the church would only see ... the pain and suffering of the
world. If our eyes would only open to see the task of the church to
stand where God stands, against all injustice and pain and
suffering,'' Boesak said.
   Boesak, who is a leader of the anti-apartheid movement in South
Africa, was warmly received by the more than 2,000 people who filled
the Kentucky Center for the Arts to begin the daylong welcome for
the religious group.
   The service included messages from other religious leaders in the
community, including Dr. Roy L. Honeycutt, president of the Southern
Baptist Seminary in Louisville and the Most Rev. Thomas C. Kelly,
archbishop of Louisville's Catholics.
   Proceeds from the collection at the service were turned over to
the Louisville Coalition for the Homeless. Church leaders said they
picked the group to emphasize that while the denomination had found
a home, others still had none.
   Presbyterians split in 1861 and only rejoined one another in
1983. Previous headquarters were located in New York and Atlanta.
   David Jones, chairman of the board of Humana Inc., donated the
two buildings that now form the new headquarters. The buildings had
once been two hardware warehouses.
   `Since our reunion in 1983, we have been on a journey. Now,
thanks to your gift, we have a home,'' said the Rev. C. Kenneth
Hall, moderator of the General Assembly and chairman of the
dedication committee.
   Jones, who is a Presbyterian layman, formally turned over the
structure. A new plaque unveiled states that the building was
``Dedicated to the Glory of God.''

   Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi financier and
arms dealer wanted in the United States on racketeering charges, was
in Saudi Arabia on Saturday, his office manager said.
   ``Yes, he is in the kingdom,'' Sofian Yassine, manager of
Khashoggi's office in Riyadh, said in a telephone interview from
Saudi Arabia.
   An arrest warrant has been issued in the United States for
Khashoggi. The wealthy businessman is wanted in connection with
fraud and racketeering charges filed against deposed Phillipine
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The U.S. government accused Khasoggi of acting as a front for
Marcos to help divert assets and hide Marcos' ownership of real
estate and works of art. A statement denying the charges was
delivered to the English-language Arab News in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia,
which published it Thursday.
   Khashoggi, 53, was also a central figure in the secret sale of
arms to Iran by Reagan administration officials. The United States
and Saudi Arabia have no extradition agreement.
   Khashoggi's lawyers in New York said on Friday that the financier
has not decided whether to appear voluntarily for a U.S. court
hearing. No court date for Khashoggi's appearance has been scheduled.
   The Los Angeles Times, quoting unidentified sources, reported
Friday that U.S. officials obtained the arrest warrant for Khashoggi
because they feared he would relocate to a country with no
extradition treaty with the United States.
   The United States has extradition agreements with Britain, France
and Spain, the countries where Khashoggi has primary residences
aside from his native Saudi Arabia.
   His Riyadh office manager would not say when Khashoggi had
arrived in the kingdom or how long he would stay. ``He comes and
goes frequently,'' said Yassine.
   Khashoggi's financial empire, a wealth symbolic of the Arab oil
boom of the 1970s, has been crumbling in recent years under a pile
of debt.

<HEAD>Town Returns To Normal After Whale Rescue Pandemonium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARROW, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life returned to normal Saturday in the
United States' northernmost community as the last of a crowd of
people left town after the rescue of two whales trapped by Arctic
Ocean ice.
   ``It's pretty quiet,'' said Connie Kunaknana, desk clerk at the
40-room Top of the World Hotel, packed since mid-October when the
plight of three California gray whales drew scientists, other
rescuers and reporters to Barrow.
   Two of the whales apparently swam to freedom Friday after one of
two Soviet icebreakers crashed through the ice that imprisoned the
mammals for nearly three weeks off the northern Alaska coast. A week
earlier, a third whale ceased to appear at a breathing hole in the
ice and was presumed dead.
   The whales became trapped while migrating southward to warmer
waters off the coast of Mexico.
   With the rescue over at a cost of more than $1 million and the
out-of-towners gone, residents of Barrow settled back into their
Saturday routines.
   ``People get up and go to the post office, some people work,''
said K.P. Miller, an announcer at KBRW-AM. ``When the store opens,
they go to the store and do their shopping. A lot of people do
laundry.'' The school gymnasium opens later in the day and is a
popular gathering place, she said.
   With winter approaching, first light in the town of some 1,500
residents doesn't come until about 10:30 a.m.
   ``It's getting dark now, so people aren't getting up as early as
they were,'' Miller said. ``If it were hunting season, people would
be getting up early and getting their boats ready.''
   Whales are among the animals hunted by Eskimos, who have
subsistence hunting rights.
   But they generally hunt bowheads, and when the California grays
were confined by the ice, Eskimos wielding chain saws put in long
hours to cut holes that allowed them to breathe. The series of holes
gradually led the two survivors toward a channel cut by one of the
icebreakers.
   The sawyers were paid $15 to $16 an hour under a jobs program run
by the North Slope Borough.
   The influx of people triggered by the trapped whales generated
work and income in addition to the jobs on the ice. A T-shirt
industry offering at least three commemorative logos took shape
quickly, some of the visitors bought fur garments, taxi services did
a booming business and residents rented out their snowmobiles.
   By Saturday, only three guests remained at the Top of the World,
where people had been lodging three to a room during the crush,
Kunaknana said. A hotel near the airport also had been full, and
part of the overflow went to quarters at an arctic research
laboratory nearby. Residents willing to turn their homes into
temporary inns put their names on a list.
   Pepe's North of the Border, specializing in Mexican food, was
back to its normal clientele Saturday after weeks of feeding frenzy,
said Bob Green, an employee at the restaurant.
   ``This morning we have our regular people, more familiar faces
than we've seen in the last few weeks,'' he said.
   Green said the restaurant had to place its food orders earlier
than usual and used reserves to keep meals on the table during the
unexpected patronage by journalists and whale specialists.
   ``It was a good experience but we're glad to see it over with,''
he said.

   An Iranian rebel leader said Saturday the
Iranian government is recruiting terrorists to kidnap and
assassinate opponents in foreign countries.
   The rebel leader also claimed the American hostages in Lebanon
are held by the Iranian terrorists, not by Moslem extremist groups
as is widely believed.
   The Americans are held in a special underground base near Baalbek
in the Bekaa Valley of southern Lebanon, said Ali Reza Jaferzadeh,
chief spokesman for the anti-government People's Mujahedeen
Organization. He spoke to The Associated Press in Baghdad.
   He said the terrorists were recruited from Iran's Revolutionary
Guards.
   He said the terrorist unit is controlled by Hashemi Rafsanjani,
speaker of Iran's Parliament and acting commander in chief of its
armed forces, and receives logistical support from the Iranian
Embassy in Damascus, Syria.
   ``The American hostages are held at Sheikh Abdullah Base of the
Revolutionary Guards in Baalbeck,'' the rebel said. ``The man who is
in charge of the base is a commander of the (Revolutionary) Guards
division in Lebanon, whose name is Khascar.''
   Kidnappers hold nine Americans captive in Lebanon, in addition to
seven other foreigner. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   The hostages are believed held by Iranian-backed Moslem extremist
groups, which have periodically released photographs and videos of
the hostages and made demands in exchange for their release.
   Jaferzadeh said the Iranian unit works with other
Iranian-financed terrorist groups in Lebanon, such as the Islamic
Jihad and Hezbollah. He said those groups also take orders directly
from Rafsanjani.
   Jaferzadeh said the terrorist unit has targeted members of his
group.
   He said the unit represents one of many ``hunting squads'' set up
by the Iranian government to kill or kidnap opponents in other
countries.
   ``They have received special training in a (Revolutionary) Guards
camp near Tehran before they were dispatched to Turkey,'' he said.
   He said a Mujahedeen activist, Abul Hassan Mojtahedzadeh, was
kidnapped while walking across Aqsary Square in Istanbul, Turkey on
Oct. 11 and tortured by Iranian agents.
   Turkish authorities have said two Iranian diplomats and two other
Iranians tried to kidnap an Iranian engineer in Istanbul. The
diplomats were asked to leave.
   Jaferzadeh also said the Iranian agents killed a Saudi diplomat
in Ankara as part of a separate campaign aimed at diplomats of
unfriendly Arab countries. A group calling itself Islamic Jihad in
Hijaz earlier claimed responsibility for that attack.

   Pietro Annigoni, a portrait artist who
painted the British royal family and President Kennedy, has died at
the age of 78, the Italian news agency ANSA reported Saturday.
   Annigoni died Friday of kidney failure, doctors said. He was
admitted to Florence's Careggi hospital last week due to
complications from an operation for a perforated ulcer in May.
   Annigoni was born in Milan and studied art in Florence. During
his career, he painted portraits of the British royal family; the
shah of Iran and his wife, Farah Diba; Pope John XXIII and
Presidents Johnson and Kennedy.
   He was also known for his frescoes in several churches in
northern Italy.
   Survivors include his widow Rosa. A funeral was scheduled for
Sunday.

<HEAD>Dukakis at Rousing Farm Rally; Bush Criticizes Him in Chicago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A resurgent Michael Dukakis carried his ``on your side'' rallying
cry to the Farm Belt on Saturday while George Bush accused his
Democratic rival of trying to divide Americans by telling them
``everything's going to hell in a handbasket.''
   With 10 days remaining to the election, the nationwide public
polls continued to show a substantial advantage for Republican
candidate Bush. But Democrats insisted their private soundings were
showing unmistakable signs of movement in Dukakis' direction in
states from California to Florida.
   Bush sidestepped a question on CNN's ``Newsmaker Saturday'' about
whether he was concerned over tightening polls. He forecast a close
election and said, ``Everybody's predicted that from day one.''
   The vice president's campaign threw a fresh commercial into the
battle of the airwaves, attacking Dukakis as the author of the
``largest tax increase in the history of Massachusetts.''
   Dukakis tailored his Populist-style rhetoric to his farm
audience. ``They want to help the people who live high off the
hog,'' he said in Sioux Falls, S.D. ``We want to help the people who
raise the hogs.''
   A 50-state survey by The Associated Press, meanwhile, shows that
Bush is leading for as many as 359 electoral votes but has not
locked up the 270 that would assure him a victory. Dukakis leads for
just 78 electoral votes. Nine states offering 101 votes are rated as
tossups, including Illinois, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
   The presidential race aside, both parties had their eyes on the
33 Senate races on the ballot. The odds favored continued Democratic
control, although Bush and President Reagan have coordinated their
appearances to raise the chances of GOP candidates in several states.
   Democrats are heavily favored to retain their majority control of
the House in the Nov. 8 elections, as well.
   Dukakis was pursuing his underdog's strategy to the end, lining
up network television appearances and making the unprecedented
decision to give his running mate a five-minute solo performance on
a network commercial. Lloyd Bentsen said in the ad, scheduled for
Sunday night, that the Republicans have run a campaign of ``trash
the truth'' with their attacks on Dukakis.
   There were the usual light moments blended into the serious
business of running for president.
   Barbara Bush joked that if Bush does end up in retirement after
the election and wants to drive his own car, she's not sitting with
him. ``I am not getting in a car with a man who hasn't driven in
years,'' she said, in reference to the Secret Service-driven
limousine that the vice president rides everywhere.
   After months and months of candidates' charges and commercials,
there were a few reminders that there actually is an election
waiting at the end of the campaign trail.
   President and Mrs. Reagan cast their absentee ballots in
California. Bentsen and his wife B.A. did likewise in Texas.
   That made the score two for the Democrats and two for the
Republicans, with one week and two days of frantic campaigning to go.
   Dukakis was in South Dakota speaking to an audience from the
surrounding states.
   His aides issued a statement criticizing the Reagan
administration's rejection of complaints that rice farmers are being
treated unfairly by the Japanese. The decision ``raises the question
of whose side they are on,'' the statement said of the Republicans.
   ``Japan's determination to keep its market closed hurts our
farmers and serves only Japan,'' it said.
   Bush campaigned by bus through Chicago's suburbs during the day,
criticizing Dukakis for trying to depict him as an elitist and
accusing his rival of trying to divide the nation along class lines.
   ``I'm going to bring it together. ... I am not going to let that
liberal governor divide this country,'' he said. ``I'd hate to be my
opponent, dragging myself around this country, trying to convince
Americans that everything's going to hell in a handbasket.''
   He also spoke of the whales trapped in ice off Alaska _ now freed
_ to campaign against Dukakis. ``I only hope for those whales that
they don't end up in Boston Harbor,'' he said.

   Mississippi corrections officials didn't
realize Shelly Teague had never served a single day of his four-year
prison sentence until they couldn't find him to let him out on
parole.
   They said the convicted drug dealer must have escaped, but they
later learned Teague was at home in Pascagoula, where he'd been all
the time waiting for word on when to report to prison.
   Now Teague, who was arrested Sept. 3, has filed a motion asking
that the sentence be set aside.
   Public defender Tom Fortner, who represented Teague in 1985, said
he expects the motion to be heard this week.
   According to the motion, Teague pleaded guilty to a charge of
drug distribution in 1985 based on a promise he would be given a
90-day sentence.
   When the four-year sentence was imposed, Teague was allowed to
delay his prison entrance date because of an illness in his family.
   Teague's motion says he reported back on the scheduled date ready
to go to the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, and was
given a later date.
   ``Petitioner did in fact keep the second return date and that
time was instructed by Mr. Fortner to go back home but to keep in
touch with him, that due to overcrowding conditions at Parchman
there was no available bed,'' the motion says.
   Teague said he followed these instructions until he was told by
Fortner that the public defender would notify him of further
developments.
   ``Petitioner did exactly as he was told to do,'' the petition
says. ``He quit worrying about his sentence and went on with his
life.''
   The Circuit Court Clerk's office says Teague never paid his
$1,000 fine or $250 in restitution.
   It was unclear if Teague was in custody Saturday. No telephone
number is listed for him, attorneys and prosecutors involved the
case did not answer their phones, and a person who answered the
phone at the prison refused to answer questions.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis opened a 10-day final
push in his underdog bid for the presidency Saturday by promising a
crowd of about 10,000 at a rousing rally that he would fight for
American farmers and workers.
   Dukakis stopped on a trip to California to visit Sioux Falls for
a ``Salute to Rural America,'' a fairgrounds event with an audience
including supporters bused in from Iowa, North Dakota, Nebraska and
Minnesota.
   ``They want you to forget their record,'' Dukakis told a
boisterous crowd of about 10,000 people. ``Rural Americans have lost
a lot, but they haven't lost their memories.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee blamed Reagan administration
farm policies for a drop in farm exports, falling crop prices and
the loss of 250,000 family farms in the past eight years.
   Dukakis promised an administration sympathetic to small towns and
said rival George Bush instead wanted to give a $40 billion tax
break to the nation's wealthy.
   ``They want to help the people who live high off the hog,''
Dukakis said. ``We want to help the people in this country who raise
the hogs.''
   Dukakis, surrounded by elected officials from the five states,
told his audience that the ``Republican philosophy is the fewer
farms the better.''
   ``Every farm and ranch in this country counts, and every small
town is somebody's home,'' Dukakis said to enthusiastic applause.
   Dukakis ridiculed Bush's promise to wage a ``kinder, gentler''
campaign in the final weeks, a pledge Bush made just before resuming
harsh attacks on Dukakis.
   ``I wish his handlers would make up his mind,'' Dukakis said.
   Sioux Falls was the first stop for Dukakis on a final-push
campaign trip that will bring him to an average of four cities a
day. Still well behind Bush in most polls but encouraged by a recent
tightening of the race, Dukakis is keeping a high television profile
during the waning days of the campaign to help him spread his
message.
   Dukakis tailored his Populist appeal to rural and farm issues,
accusing the Reagan administration of turning its back on family
farmers and rural communities.
   He also criticized a Friday decision by the administration to
refuse a request by U.S. rice farmers to investigate Japan's trading
practices and said the decision was an ominous harbinger of the
trade policies Bush would bring to the White House.
   ``This decision is only the latest instance of the Republicans'
refusal to stand up for American jobs and American farmers in world
markets,'' Dukakis said in a statement. ``The facts are so
unequivocal that this decision raises grave doubts about the
Republicans' intention to enforce the new trade act.''
   In contrast, Dukakis said, he and running mate Lloyd Bentsen
would demand that foreign countries with access to U.S. markets open
their doors to U.S. products. And he said a Dukakis administration
would bring to rural America reasonable price supports for farmers,
financing for economic development in rural communities, an
immediate $100 million investment in rural health care, and
agressive enforcement of worker safety guidelines _ a hot issue in
this state, where the John Morrell & Co., meatpacking plant was
fined $4.3 million Friday after being accused of violations of
safety standards.
   Dukakis met with several Morrell workers before addressing the
rally, and he questioned the timing of the fine.
   ``We're not going to wait until 10 days before the election to do
something about it,'' he said of safety problems in the meatpacking
and other industries.
   He also said the Farmers Home Administration was waiting until
six days after the election to mail out notices to 90,000 family
farmers, telling them they will have to refinance loans or face
foreclosure.
   Dukakis said he could sense the race was tightening and joked
about his vision of the outcome.
   ``This one is going to go down to the wire and it's going to be
one by a nose,'' Dukakis said. ``If this one is one by a nose, I
don't have to tell you who's going to win.''
   Dukakis headed from South Dakota to California for an evening
rally with supporters in the Watts section of Los Angeles. On Sunday
he is taking a train tour through several California communities.
Dukakis is on the road through Election Day, scheduled to arrive
home on a cross-country flight that gets him to Boston shortly after
the polls open.

<HEAD>Researchers To Tap Into Medicare Data</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is spending about $8 million
this year to design computer programs that will enable researchers
for the first time to glean treatment information from the files of
some 32 million Medicare recipients.
   Bob Hardy, a spokesman for the Health Care Information Resource
Center which runs the Medicare and Medicaid programs, said the
agency will seek another $72 million next year for the program aimed
at tapping the nation's largest collection of medical data.
   Dr. William L. Roper, head of the HFCA, said the computerized
network on treatments, planned to start in 1990, may provide the
next revolution in medical care.
   ``We're trying to extend the science,'' Roper said, referring to
the belief among physicians and other practitioners that medicine
has always been a combination of both art and science.
   The government has been collecting data on patients' diagnoses,
treatments and outcomes since the Medicare insurance program began
in 1965. The information comes from claims billed by physicians,
hospitals and other health care providers.
   Hardy said the data base has not been used before to analyze the
most effective treatments out of concerns for patient privacy, a
lack of computer resources and fear of government intrusion into
medical practices.
   ``The time is ripe for it now,'' Hardy said, adding there is no
intent in the program ``to force doctors to use specific
procedures.''
   Roper and Hardy acknowledged that quantified data from the files
on various treatments could be used by professional societies,
private insurers and the government in setting new treatment
guidelines and ferreting out ineffective or unneccessary practices.
   ``That part is secondary,'' Hardy said. ``It's down the pike and
would happen naturally, but ultimately, it would be a by-product.
The only way this thing will work successfully is with the
cooperation of the medical community.''
   At the agency's request, 13 leading physicians convened by the
National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine met last week to
pick priority areas where the quantitative studies should begin.
   Among a list tentatively chosen were treatments for angina or
heart pain, heart attacks, breast cancer, prostate troubles, strokes
and hip fractures, Hardy said. Together, they account for billions
of dollars spent on health care annually.
   ``In practice, physicians want to do the best by their patients
that they can,'' Hardy said. ``And when they can plug into a source
of better, more updated information, we believe they're going to be
able to do a better job.''

<HEAD>Iceland Protests U.S. Effort to Stop Whale Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has protested U.S.
efforts to pressure Japan to stop buying Icelandic whale products, a
newspaper said Saturday.
   Morgunbladid, the country's largest newspaper, reported Iceland's
Foreign Ministry said it was the first time the U.S. government had
promoted trade sanctions against Iceland, a fellow member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``The ministry considers the Washington government is making a
fool of Icelandic authorities,'' the paper said.
   As a protest, it said Iceland canceled a meeting with commanders
of a NATO base in Keflavik, which is manned by about 3,000 U.S. Navy
personnel.
   Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson called U.S. Ambassador
Nicholas Ruwe to the Foreign Ministry on Friday and handed him ``a
strongly worded protest'' against U.S. efforts to impose the
sanctions, the newspaper said.
   The Foreign Ministry was closed Saturday, and no spokesman was
available to comment on the report.
   According to the paper, Bill Evans, director of the U.S.
Fisheries Department, approached Japanese government officials in
Tokyo on Oct. 21 and offered them certain benefits if they stopped
buying whale meat and other whaling products from Iceland. The paper
did not elaborate on the benefits.
   Critics of what Iceland calls its ``scientific whaling program''
say Iceland is killing whales and later selling their meat and other
products.
   Iceland has said it will take up to 78 whales in 1988 for
scientific research.

   An East German woman was wounded by
Czechoslovak border guards when she and another escapee swam across
a river to Austria, but both made it to the West, newspapers
reported Saturday.
   The unidentified 22-year-old woman was hit in the hip by a bullet
that narrowly missed her kidney in the Oct. 23 escape, said reports
carried by the Kurier and AZ newspapers.
   She and her 25-year-old boyfriend managed to climb over border
fences and descended into the March river, but as they swam,
communist border guards spotted them and opened fire, the newspapers
said.
   With the help of her companion, the injured woman reportedly
reached the Austrian side, where the man's brother waited in a car
near Baumgarten.
   The refugees immediately drove through Austria to West Germany,
where the woman was taken to a hospital in the border town of Bad
Reichenhall, the reports said.

   Seconds before the scheduled blastoff, the maiden
voyage of the Soviet space shuttle was delayed Saturday because of
trouble with ground equipment. It was the fifth setback this year
for the Soviet space program.
   Soviet officials did not immediately announce when a second
attempt would be made to launch the Buran on its unmanned test
flight.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said scientists at the
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia traced Saturday's snag to
an equipment platform that failed to pull away from the booster
rocket.
   With 51 seconds to go, a computer stopped the countdown because
the booster, known as Energiya, would have hit the platform at
takeoff.
   The sudden halt was similar to the dramatic last-minute
postponement of the liftoff of the world's first shuttle. The U.S.
craft Columbia was delayed for two days in April 1981 because of
computer software problems. Some subsequent U.S. shuttle flights
also were delayed.
   ``The accessory platform for emergency evacuation of cosmonauts
... didn't move away from the Energiya body to a safe distance,''
Tass said 11 hours after the scheduled 6:23 a.m. liftoff.
   Tass said a computer that senses 140 elements of the launch
system halted the countdown and that thousands of tons of liquid
fuel were being drained from Energiya. The report quoted Baikonur's
test control chief, Air Force Maj. Gen. Vladimir E. Gudilin.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said the platform contained
equipment to aim the spacecraft toward the proper trajectory. The
newspaper quoted Gudilin as saying the platform withdrew somewhat,
but not completely.
   Gudilin was quoted as saying he didn't think it would be long
before the launch would be attempted again, but he said a thorough
analysis of the problem would have to be completed.
   Soviet television, in its evening news program Vremya, said the
words ``automatic termination of preparations'' flashed on a
computer screen at Baikonur as dozens of scientists watched.
   The broadcast showed the gleaming white shuttle orbiter and
rocket booster on the launch pad after the liftoff attempt, with
what it said was liquid oxygen venting from Energiya.
   The shuttle, which looks like the U.S. space shuttle, was
scheduled to orbit the Earth twice and land on a runway eight miles
from the blastoff site. The flight was to be controlled entirely by
computers and was meant to test launch and landing equipment and
procedures, Soviet news reports said. There was no indication the
shuttle was to have deployed any satellites.
   Buran can carry as many as 10 people _ four cosmonauts and six
passengers. It is attached to Energiya, the world's most powerful
launcher, and four liquid-fuel boosters.
   Saturday's postponement was the latest in a series of problems
that have dogged Soviet space flights since the spring:
   _Ground controllers lost contact in April with a Soviet
nuclear-powered satellite, Cosmos-1900, and Western Europeans
expressed concern it would release radioactivity when it re-entered
the atmosphere. The satellite burned up safely upon re-entry Oct. 2.
   _Soviet cosmonaut Anatoly Levchenko, a 47-year-old test pilot for
the shuttle program, died Aug. 6 of a brain tumor. Levchenko had
been among the candidates to fly the shuttle on its first manned
mission. His death leaves Igor Volk the only cosmonaut known to be
in line for a shuttle flight.
   _A ground controller sent an incorrect signal to the unmanned
Soviet space probe Phobos 1 on Aug. 29, freezing the craft and
ending its radio contact with Earth. The probe was on its way to
Mars on a multimillion-dollar mission to unlock the mysteries of the
planet.
   _On Sept. 6, an Afghan and Soviet cosmonaut were stranded in
orbit aboard a Soyuz TM-5 capsule with diminishing air and food
after two unsuccessful attempts to land. The cosmonauts eventually
overcame human error and equipment problems to land safely.
   In Saturday's attempted launch, Tass initially announced a
four-hour delay but then said blastoff had been delayed
indefinitely. Soviet television did not cover launch preparations
live, and foreign reporters were not allowed to visit Baikonur.
   Soviet officials say the Buran orbiter can carry a payload of
66,000 pounds, compared to the U.S. shuttle's 55,000 pounds, and
that it is more flexible and safer.
   In the past, the officials have been critical of the U.S. shuttle
program, suspended until this fall after seven astronauts were
killed in the explosion of the Challenger in January 1986.
   In a report late Friday, the evening television news program
revealed Soviet military involvement in the Soviet shuttle program.
It identified the military official overseeing shuttle operations as
Alexander A. Maksimov but did not say how the Defense Ministry would
use the craft.

   Mayor Tom Bradley, digging into some of the
ice cream he won in a World Series baseball bet with Oakland Mayor
Lionel Wilson savored the victory, declaring ``How sweet it is!''
   Flanked by two ice cream carts and standing before a wall-length
banner boasting ``World Champion Dodgers,'' Bradley spooned a bite
of vanilla ice cream into the mouth of Dodger executive Tommy ``The
Hawk'' Hawkins.
   ``Today I partake in the ultimate ice cream. Here's to 1989,''
Hawkins said during a City Hall victory party Friday.
   Bradley made the bet with Wilson Oct. 12, the day Orel Hershiser
pitched a shutout, leading the Los Angeles team to a 6-0 National

   If the Dodgers lost the series to the Oakland Athletics, the

Southern California oranges. But if the Dodgers won, Wilson said
he'd deliver a crate of Oakland-made Dreyer's ice cream to City Hall.

   A week after the ferry ship Dona
Marilyn capsized and sank during Typhoon Ruby, the vessel's owners
and the coast guard disagree on how many people perished.
   The Dona Marilyn, owned by Sulpicio Lines Inc., was carrying more
than 500 people when it sank Monday in the Visayan sea en route from
Manila to Tacloban on the central island of Leyte.
   The exact number of passengers and crew aboard has not been
determined.
   Reports on the number of survivors ranged from 194 to 243 and
those of bodies recovered from 27 to 65, with up to 258 people
missing.
   The coast guard station in the city of Cebu increased its
survivor count from 203 to 243 Saturday.
   Lt. Manuel Lizaso, contacted by telephone, said coast guard
authorities determined that the original count did not include 40
crewmen who were rescued.
   Carlos Go, Sulpicio president and general manager, said his
company's count was 205 survivors, ``and that includes everybody _
passengers and crew.''
   On Friday both the company and coast guard said 27 bodies were
recovered, but a coast guard report Saturday placed the figure at 39.
   Lizaso said 12 more bodies were recovered and eight were placed
aboard the Cebu Princess, one of the three Sulpicio vessels plying
the channels around the numerous tiny islands in the area where the
Dona Marylin sank, 300 miles southeast of Manila.
   Go, contacted by telephone at his head office in Cebu, said 16
bodies were aboard the Cebu Princess and they were included in the
count of 27. He said the 16 bodies were removed from a mass grave on
the island of Almagro where they were buried by local authorities.
   Eight other bodies washed ashore on Almagro where at least 120
survivors were located, according to Go.
   On Friday, Sulpicio's station manager in Tacloban said 31 bodies
were buried on the island of Capul bringing the death toll to 65.
But Go and Lizaso said the report was not confirmed.
   A statement by the Department of Social Services said only 194
survivors were found.
   Meanwhile, the Philippine Red Cross and other relief agencies
said Saturday the typhoon's death toll on land was 207. They had
reported Friday that the toll was 233 and said the discrepancy was
caused by errors in reporting.
   The Department of Social Services said 1.8 million people were
affected by the typhoon, and the Office of Civil Defense estimated
damage to property and crops at $100 million.

   One of five people poisoned when they ate
``death cap'' mushrooms at a dinner party underwent liver transplant
surgery Saturday, hours after the same operation was performed on a
man whose mother also received a donor liver.
   Another person who shared the wild Amanita phalloides mushrooms
received a donor liver earlier, and the fifth person was still being
evaluated.
   Surgery began Saturday morning on Teresa Ok Hui Duncan at the
Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital, said spokeswoman Lee
Lewis. A liver for Duncan, 43, of Portland, was located late Friday,
and the operation was expected to take six to 16 hours.
   Dr. Emmet Keeffe said Friday night that Duncan had shown signs of
``deterioration in her mental faculties'' but could still recognize
relatives.
   The five ate the mushrooms on Oct. 22. Authorities have said the
mushrooms, which resemble a species available commercially in Asia,
were picked in the Columbia River gorge, apparently by members of
the group.
   Surgery for Andy Clark, 33, of Hillsboro, was completed early
Saturday at University of California-San Francisco Medical Center.
   Clark was in stable but critical condition, which is normal
following a transplant operation, said a spokeswoman for the medical
center.
   Clark's mother, Isan Pak, 52, of Hillsboro, was in stable but
critical condition after nearly nine hours of surgery Friday at the
Portland Veterans Administration Hospital, next door to the Oregon
Health Sciences hospital.
   ``She wouldn't have survived without the transplant,'' said Dr.
C. Wright Pinson, who performed the operation. ``Her liver had been
severely affected by these mushrooms and was half its normal size.''
   Pinson said Pak suffered some neurological dysfunction and
intestinal damage, but added he was ``quite hopeful'' she would
recover.
   Another woman who ate the mushrooms, Glenda Sabolyk, had improved
from critical to serious but stable condition at the UCSF Medical
Center, where she underwent transplant surgery Thursday.
   Sabolyk, 41, of Clackamas, was ``doing well,'' said Pat Forsyth,
a spokeswoman for the medical center.
   Duncan's husband..John, was in serious condition at Bess Kaiser
Hospital in Portland, where doctors were watching him for signs of
liver damage and other health problems associated with eating the
mushrooms.

   A woman convicted of being a Red Brigades terrorist
and complicity in the killing of former Premier Aldo Moro was
extradited from Spain to Italy on Saturday.
   Gianfranca Lupi was tried in absentia by an Italian court in 1983
and sentenced to eight years years in prison. She arrived in Rome on
a flight from Madrid.
   Officials, citing security reasons, declined to say where she was
imprisoned. Ms. Lupi had been sought under a fugitive warrant issued
in 1982.
   She was arrested last year in France for using false documents
when she entered the country from Spain, and French authorities
deported her to Spain in November.
   Spain subsequently ordered her extradition to Italy.
   Moro was kidnapped on March 18, 1978, by terrorists of the
leftist Red Brigades. About two months later his body was found in a
car abandoned in Rome.
   Fifty-nine defendants were convicted of being Red Brigades
terrorists involved in Moro's death, and 32 were sentenced to life
in prison. The others were given sentences ranging from four months
to 30 years.

   Light snow was widely scattered from the Midwest to New England
on Saturday, and rain fell across parts of the South.
   Cold air flowing west across the warm water of Lake Ontario
produced light ``lake effect'' snow along the shoreline of western
New York. Lake effect snow showers also occurred over Upper Michigan
and northern Lower Michigan as cold air moved across Lake Superior
and northern Lake Michigan.
   An upper air disturbance over the northern Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley produced snow flurries over Iowa and eastern
South Dakota.
   Light snow also fell over sections of northern New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over south-central,
eastern and north-central Texas. In the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT,
Palacios got 1.67 inches of rain.
   Showers also were scattered along a stationary front from
southeastern Mississippi to South Carolina.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 20s over northern
Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, Upper Michigan and sections of the
northern Rockies.
   International Falls, Minn., had a record low for the date of 11
degrees and Duluth, Minn., posted a record low of 14.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 19
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 88 at Fort Myers and Tampa, Fla.
Saturday morning's low was 2 degrees at Warroad, Minn.
   For Sunday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast over
north-central and eastern Texas, Louisiana and southwestern
Arkansas. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast over
northern Florida. Scattered showers also were forecast over
southeastern Kansas. Widely scattered showers were forecast over
northwestern Washington state.
   Highs in the 30s were predicted over northern New England, New
York, northern parts of the Great Lakes and northeastern Minnesota;
in the 40s from southern New England across the Ohio Valley and
northern parts of the middle Mississippi Valley to eastern sections
of the northern Plains; in the 70s and 80s over Florida, the Gulf
Coast region, the southern half of Texas, the front range of the
Colorado Rockies, the desert Southwest and inland valleys of
California; and in the 50s and 60s over the remainder of the nation.

   A woman who is dying of pancreatic cancer
collected material for the final chapter of her autobiography
Saturday when she attended her own funeral.
   Carrie Munson planned the funeral before her death because she
wanted to see the faces of ``friends, associates and enemies,'' she
said.
   Munson, 62, is a former heroin addict with a fourth-grade
education who went on to get a college degree in her 40s and become
a broadcaster and social worker.
   She is writing an autobiography, ``Bury Me in My Cap and Gown,''
and said the funeral would be the perfect way to end the book.
   ``You can't communicate with your friends and tell them how you
feel inside a box,'' Munson said.
   ``This is a moment in my life that I will never forget and after
I'm gone I'll remember it too,'' said Munson, wearing the cap and
gown she wore when she graduated from University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1975.
   The outfit made her stand out among the more than 100 people who
paid their respects at the New Hope Baptist Church. ``As I look
around, I don't see any enemies. All I see is friends,'' she said.
   The Rev. R.L. Lathan used his eulogy to praise Munson's
determination and faith in God.
   ``You have stood up with faith,'' he said. ``Carrie, there is no
guarantee you won't be able to wear that cap and gown again. Many of
us here with you may beat you to the grave.''
   For Munson, the cap and gown are something to be proud of.
   Until she was in her 40s, Munson had only a fourth-grade
education. After 25 years of drug addiction and small-time crime and
several suicide attempts, she decided to do something with her life.
   Munson said she prayed, began to hate the drugs and set out to
prove herself by attending college.
   ``I knew I wasn't stupid. I knew I wasn't dumb,'' she said. ``If
I take what I learned on the street and put it into this B.A. ...
I'll have a masterpiece.''
   Munson graduated with a degree in journalism and mass
communications in 1975. Since then, she has worked as a radio jazz
show host and as a social worker with Wisconsin Correctional
Services.
   ``The doctor says I'm dying. I know I'm a very sick woman. I have
a lot of pain,'' Munson said. ``But I don't plan on going home,
lying down and dying.''
   Ziff Sistrunk said he took a bus from Chicago to attend
Saturday's ceremony after reading about Munson's funeral plans in a
newspaper article.
   He sang the Frank Sinatra hit ``I Did It My Way'' during the
ceremony, saying he had read that Munson cherished the song.

   David Snow embarked on a one-man crusade
for children's safety after a stray lawn dart killed his 7-year-old
daughter, and he says it won't stop until he draws his last breath.
   Michele Snow died in April 1987 after one of the heavy,
metal-tipped toys pierced her skull. Her father launched an
emotional campaign to ban sales of the darts, and on Friday the
federal Consumer Product Safety Commission voted to do just that.
   The ban came too late for another little girl not much older than
Michele. Eleven-year-old Amy Herrin of McMinnville, Tenn., has been
in a drug-induced coma in a Nashville hospital since a lawn dart
penetrated 2 inches into her skull while she played the game
Tuesday. Doctors began to bring her out of the coma on Saturday as
the swelling in her brain subsided.
   Snow's battle against lawn darts exposed him to hundreds of
unsafe products sold in toy stores, and now he wants them banned,
too.
   ``You ain't seen nothing yet,'' he said. ``Lawn darts are just
the tip of the iceberg. My anger gets greater every day with the
discoveries I make.''
   Michele was playing with dolls in the front yard while her
9-year-old brother, Paul, and two friends played out back with lawn
darts, plastic-finned projectiles tossed horseshoe-style toward a
hoop on the ground. One of the children threw too hard, and a lawn
dart sailed into the front yard, striking Michele's head.
   Doctors said the dart struck a major artery in her brain.
Machines kept her alive until they were turned off on the third day.
   ``I literally sat in a chair for about a month and the anger
started to swell inside of me,'' Snow said last week. ``I stood over
Michele's grave and I promised her that this thing that killed her
would never kill another child.''
   At 40, Snow left behind a comfortable life and became a consumer
activist, writing letters, phoning congressmen, meeting with
reporters, and testifying at congressional hearings.
   He has spent $21,000 in savings and missed four mortgage payments
to fund his lobbying. Research and travel took him away from his job
as an aeronautics production supervisor at Hughes Aircraft for weeks
at a time.
   In March, the Consumer Product Safety Commission rejected a ban
on lawn darts, but Snow kept plugging, backed by his wife, Linda.
   In June, the commission released a study reporting lawn darts had
killed three children and injured an estimated 6,100 people between
1978 and 1986.
   Reversing itself, the commission decided to consider a ban on
lawn darts. Friday's vote confirmed that ban, which could take
effect as early as Dec. 4.
   Snow is already working on other hazards facing children. He left
Hughes Aircraft in June to start the Michele Snow Foundation. It
pays him a salary of $36,000 a year, 15 percent less than he made at
Hughes.
   Michele's old bedroom is foundation headquarters. ``I sit in this
room 16 hours a day, seven days a week,'' Snow said. ``I've never
worked so hard in my life.''
   Next to the desk sits a box of toys that fail to amuse Snow. He
grabbed a plastic rattle and squeezed. Two little bells fell out,
and Snow popped them into his mouth to show how easily a baby could
choke on them.
   He pulled on a flimsy mobile, made for hanging over a crib. The
string broke and plastic disks showered onto the desk.
   ``Can you imagine a kid choking on this?'' he asked. ``I
guarantee you these are going to kill children. People don't realize
what crap is out there. Within three miles of this house I could buy
you 100 illegal and dangerous toys.''
   Snow mails dangerous toys to congressmen and confronts store
managers in toy departments. He's planning a newsletter on
children's safety and said he will press for more safety
restrictions and better enforcement of current laws.
   ``I can't hug my little girl like I used to,'' he said. ``This is
the only way I can manifest my love for Michele. If I can save one
child, or spare another family this horrible pain that we're going
to have to live with the rest of our lives, it's all going to be
worth it.''

   Doctors are bringing an 11-year-old girl
whose skull was pierced by a lawn dart out of her drug-induced coma,
a hospital spokeswoman said Saturday.
   Amy Herrin of McMinnville should emerge from the coma in a few
days, said Nancy Humphrey, a spokeswoman at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center. The girl was listed in critical condition in the
pediatric intensive care unit.
   ``She is off the drug that induced the coma. They don't expect
any change for the next several days,'' Humphrey said.
   Doctors operated on the child for eight hours Tuesday to remove
the 1-pound metal and plastic dart stuck 2 inches into her head,
hospital officials said. She was put into a coma to keep her brain
activity to a minimum until the swelling in the organ subsided.
   ``You can't leave a patient on a drug-induced coma for very
long,'' Humphrey said. ``The doctors felt she was stable enough that
they could take her off the drug.''
   A cousin accidentally hit Amy with the dart while playing the
horseshoes-like game, said the girl's mother, Sue Tucker.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted Friday to ban the
sale of lawn darts. An earlier commission study reported that lawn
darts had killed three children and injured an estimated 6,100
people between 1978 and 1986.

   Vice President George Bush urged Chicago
Republicans to get out the vote for an election he said indecisively
was 9 or 10 days away on Saturday.
   ``We're down to the wire now _ nine or 10 days left to go,'' Bush
said at campaign rallies in two Republican-leaning wards.
   Sheila Tate, his campaign press secretary, said the indecision
stemmed from a good-natured disagreement with Bush's wife, Barbara,
who argued that the arithmetic should include Election Day, which
would make it 10 days. Bush personally holds to the nine-day theory.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Saturday
accused his election rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, of
leading Israel on a ``dangerous adventure'' in his quest for peace.
   The leader of the right-wing Likud bloc told about 2,000 cheering
supporters waving signs reading ``Only Shamir will bring peace''
that their choice in Tuesday's general election will be crucial.
   ``It's time for the people of Israel to decide whether we'll go
to direct face-to-face talks with our Arab neighbors in the normal
way or ... to an international conference, a dangerous adventure,''
he said.
   Peres, who heads the left-leaning Labor Party, favors the forum
and territorial concessions on the Israeli-occupied territories as a
possible Middle East peace solution. Shamir advocates direct talks,
rejects the conference and opposes a territorial compromise.
   ``Peres is saying: `Give me a chance. Close your eyes, shut your
ears and I'll bring peace,''' Shamir said. ``What is this, a
gambling hall? A casino?''
   The crowd of Likud fans, mostly from Jerusalem's working class
areas, booed every time Shamir said ``international conference'' and
shouted ``Peres, go home,'' during the rally at a sports hall here.
   Peres took his campaign to the southern Negev desert town of
Dimona, where he was greeted with flowers, kisses and applause by
about 1,100 Labor supporters at an auditorium.
   ``We will be able to develop the Negev,'' Peres said. ``If you
vote again for Likud, forget the Negev development. God knows why
you gave Likud your vote.''
   He referred to a high percentage of Likud voters among residents
of the Negev. Peres accuses the Likud of directing funds to Jewish
settlements in the occupied West Bank instead of development towns
in Israel, such as Dimona.
   The Likud responded by broadcasting a television ad on Saturday
quoting Labor officials as saying financial help should be given
only to Labor-led municipalities in development towns.
   Polls published Friday predicted either a Likud victory or a
stalemate. The two major parties have governed jointly in a unity
government for the past four years, following a tie in the 1984
elections.
   Likud's Meir Shitrit, an outgoing Parliament member, said he
favors another Likud-Labor coalition government.
   But Labor's campaign manager, Nissim Zvili, said his party would
agree to a national unity government only for six months until new
elections could be held.
   The peace process is the top issue in the campaign because of the
Palestinian revolt against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. More than 300 Palestinians and six Israelis have been
killed since the unrest began Dec. 8.

   The space shuttle Atlantis will be
transported to its launch pad this week for a late November liftoff
carrying a secret military satellite.
   The shuttle's giant tracked transporter is scheduled to set out
from an assembly building at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday for the four-mile,
six-hour journey to Launch Pad 39B.
   Officials had scheduled the rollout for early Tuesday, but said a
24-hour delay was forced to reconnect a loose wire in a fuel line
system.
   There will be only a few spectators, in contrast to July 4 when
Discovery made its trip to the launch pad for the first
post-Challenger shuttle flight.
   Discovery moved out into the glare of huge floodlights and was
greeted by music, thousands of space center workers, a flag-bedecked
grandstand, and NASA officials and an astronaut who made speeches
hailing a major step toward America's return to space.
   The space agency said the lack of fanfare for Atlantis' rollout
does not reflect the fact that the vehicle will carry into space a
classified intelligence-gathering satellite for the Defense
Department.
   Officials said Discovery's move was a one-time celebration,
marking the first time a shuttle had gone to the launch pad since
the shuttle Challenger exploded and killed seven astronauts on Jan.
28, 1986.
   Discovery was launched Sept. 29 with five astronauts who deployed
a communications satellite and completed a successful four-day
mission.
   Now that the shuttles are flying again, officials said they are
returning to a more normal way of doing things. Shuttles almost
always move to the pad in the early morning because the weather is
usually better then.
   Atlantis' flight will be the third all-military mission in 27
shuttle flights. Like the two previous ones, the Defense Department
and NASA have shrouded much of it in secrecy.
   The launch date will be announced, but the public will be told
only that the shuttle will lift off sometime during a three-hour
period. The countdown will be made public nine minutes before the
planned launch time, and there will be launch commentary through the
8{-minute ascent into orbit.
   After that there will be an announcement every 24 hours reporting
that Atlantis and its crew are still in orbit. If there is a major
problem affecting crew safety that will be disclosed. If everything
is normal, the landing time will be announced 16 hours in advance
and there will be commentary through the touchdown period.
   No information will be made available on the deployment of the
satellite.
   Five military astronauts, commanded by Navy Cmdr. Robert Gibson,
will fly the mission. The others are Air Force Lt. Col. Guy Gardner,
Air Force Col. Richard Mullane, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry Ross and
Navy Cmdr. William Shepherd.
   Discovery's crew had several pre-launch news conferences and
private media interviews. The media will have no access to Atlantis'
crew.
   The Air Force says the secrecy is necessary to protect national
security aspects of the mission. However, on the previous two
shuttle military flights, many news organizations reported
extensively on the payloads and other details.

<DATELINE>GROVERS MILL, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years after Orson Welles'
fictitious Martians invaded Earth, this town commemorated the
anniversary Saturday with a parade, a carnival and a bronze relief
to mark the ``landing site.''
   Revelers painted themselves green in honor of the 1938 Halloween
eve when the Mercury Theatre of the Air broadcast ``War of the
Worlds'' and unwittingly duped up to 1 million Americans into
believing that the end of the world was at hand.
   Howard Koch, who adapted the H.G. Wells novel for the broadcast,
was the marshal at Saturday's parade.
   He told the crowd that a week before the show he still had not
chosen an invasion site, so he bought a gas station map in New
Jersey, closed his eyes and picked the hamlet of Grovers Mill. He
liked the name because it had an authentic ring to it.
   ``I'm so glad my pencil landed on Grovers Mill,'' Koch said as he
surveyed the costumed extra-terrestrials parading by.
   A float by the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church proclaimed, ``The
Martians might be coming, but the Lutherans are here.''
   A convertible filled with Martians and two men wearing George
Bush and Michael Dukakis masks read, ``We have better choices on
Mars.''
   A quartet of National Guardsmen opened the ceremonies, evoking
memories of the night when Martians large enough to wade across the
Hudson River wiped out the militia with poison gas and heat rays.
   ``This is an M16, maximum effective range of 460 meters,'' said
Specialist Lorena Elmy.
   ``Guaranteed to knock a Martian right out,'' said Sgt. Craig
McCumming.
   The four-day celebration also included a masquerade ball,
fireworks, a re-enactment of the broadcast and panel discussions on
space travel and the power of the news media.
   At Eddie Kemp's lawnmower company down the road, sweatshirts that
read ``Grover's Mill Co. ... Where Martians Buy Power Equipment''
sold briskly.
   Several hundred people gathered at the clearing where the radio
show said the beings landed and where 50 years ago farmers roamed
surrounding fields with shotguns and curiosity seekers trampled
crops for a glimpse of the invaders.
   A bronze relief was unveiled depicting Welles at the microphone,
a spaceship landing near the water tower that was shot at that night
by frightened residents, and a family huddled by a radio.
   Richard Wilson, an actor on the original show, marveled at all
the hoopla. He said the young cast of the Mercury Theatre had no
great hopes for the broadcast.
   ``We thought it would be one of the weaker shows,'' he said. ``It
sort of came together at the end and we thought, `It's not bad.' But
there was no idea it would cause such a stir.''
   ``It is clear that what happened here 50 years ago was not just a
small local event, but an event whose meaning we are just beginning
to fathom,'' said Douglas Forrester, the main organizer of the
celebration.
   He and others noted that the bizarre chapter in broadcast history
prompted a half-century of analysis of the enormous power of the
airwaves.
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean recounted some of the stories reported by
hoodwinked residents that night, probably embellished in five
decades of retelling:
   _A New Jersey man stopped to warn a friend, then broke off
hurriedly and said, ``Gotta go now. The world is coming to an end
and I've got an awful lot to do,'' according to historical accounts.
   _An outraged NBC executive fumed that his network had been
scooped on the story of the millenium.
   _One man packed his family into the car, headed for the shore and
accidentally drove off the end of a pier. Nobody was hurt.
   _Another man drove through his garage door in his haste to flee,
and told his wife it didn't matter because they wouldn't be needing
the garage anymore.
   ``It left a more lasting legacy; it taught us about the
tremendous power of media communications,'' Kean said.
   Later Saturday, the Amazing Kreskin, a mentalist and night club
performer, had some 60 unsuspecting fair-goers believing the ``War
of the Worlds'' was happening all over again.
   After assembling the participants on stage, Kreskin dropped a
handkerchief.
   Soon some of the subjects claimed they saw ships starting to land
behind a display of kites some distance away. Several women began
sobbing, many ran off the stage, most pointed in the air and one man
began taking pictures of the imaginary spectacle.
   Kreskin had talked to the people earlier, selecting them from
about 80 potential subjects, and apparently laid the groundwork for
a sort of mass hypnosis.
   ``That was so real, I never saw anything like it. I actually
turned around a couple of times to see if anything was there,'' said
Lt. George Johnson, a state corrections officer helping with
security at the festival at Mercer County Park.
   Kreskin then regrouped the panicked subjects and with the drop of
a handkerchief, ended the illusion.

<HEAD>Bendjedid Drops Party Leader Seen As Opponent Of Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid dismissed his
second-in-command at the nation's only legal party Saturday, less
than a week before a referendum on political reforms sparked by
bloody riots.
   Mohamed Cherif Messaadia, who was in charge of the National
Liberation Front's permanent secretariat but considered an opponent
of Bendjedid's reform plans, was replaced by Abdelhamid Mehri,
ambassador to neighboring Morocco.
   Bendjedid also fired Gen. Mejdoub Lakehel-Ayat, the chief of
military security, and gave the job to Col. Mohamed Bechine, who was
in charge of security in the Algerian army.
   The changes were announced by the official news agency APS,
citing a statement issued by the president's office.
   The government has said 159 people were killed and 154 injured in
a week of confrontations that started Oct. 4 in Algiers and spread
to many provincial cities in the North African nation. Unofficial
reports said more than 400 were killed.
   Most of the deaths came when troops fired on unarmed protesters
who were violating a ban on demonstrations under a state of
emergency.
   Benjedid announced the referendum at the end of the week of
unrest. The Nov. 3 referendum would institute several reforms,
including making the premier answer to the National Assembly for his
government's policies.
   Until now, the premier has been responsible only to the president
and could not be ousted by the assembly.
   Mehri and Betchine are believed to be more supportive than their
predecessors of Bendjedid's efforts to break the ruling party's
monopoly on political power and public expression.
   But Bendjedid has ruled out allowing other parties to compete
with the front, which led the war with France that brought
independence in 1962 and still is presented as an essential symbol
of Algerian unity.
   The reforms to be voted on Thursday would not make major changes
in themselves, since the National Assembly remains controlled by the
party, but they are seen as part of Bendjedid's attempt to open up
political life.
   Bendjedid also made Mehri the head of a commission preparing a
crucial party congress expected in December.
   The congress is to consider further proposals to allow non-party
members to run for office and introduce contested elections for
party posts.
   The riots started as a protest against economic policies, but
spread into an expression of resentment against symbols of power
ranging from state-run department stores to government ministries.

   Palestinians raised their flags, shut down
businesses and transportation and set tires ablaze Saturday in a
general strike marking the 32nd anniversary of the slaying of 46
Arabs by Israeli troops.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded at least
26 Palestinians, hospital officials and Arab reports said. The army
said 25 were wounded.
   The army also detained dozens of Palestinian activists, including
journalists, newspaper printers and vendors in the occupied lands
and Arab east Jerusalem, over the last several days, Israel radio
said.
   The national news agency Itim said at least 33 Palestinians were
detained in the West Bank.
   The radio quoted security sources as saying the arrests were
aimed at preventing riots linked to Israel's Nov. 1 elections, the
Nov. 8 U.S. election and the planned meeting next month of the
Palestinian National Council, a Palestinian parliament-in-exile.
   The army command declined comment.
   In Gaza, the army clamped a curfew forcing nearly 260,000 Arabs
to stay home in refugee camps and neighborhoods.
   Palestinians and Israelis clashed in the Maghazi camp, where
troops shot and wounded four Arabs ranging in age from 17 to 25, and
in the Deir el Balah camp, where one man was shot and wounded,
hospital officials said. In the Gaza town of Rafah, hospital
officials said one Arab was wounded.
   Palestinians also clashed with the army in Gaza City. Officials
at Ahli Arab hospital there said nine people, including a 10- and
12-year-old, were wounded by troops.
   An army spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the
casualties in Gaza followed ``scattered disturbances in which groups
of 20 to 30 people rioted and threw stones.''
   Walls in Gaza City were covered with slogans painted by the
fundamentalist Moslem Hamas (Zeal) movement, which supported the
strike, an Arab reporter said.
   ``Yes to the Holy War, no to the Zionists,'' one slogan read.
   The strike was called by Hamas and the PLO-affiliated Unified
National Leadership of the Uprising to mark the anniversary of the
Oct. 29, 1956, massacre in Kafr Qasim, an Arab village in Israel.
   On that day, an army patrol opened fire on villagers who
unknowingly violated a curfew declared by Israel after it launched
its military campaign against Egypt in the Sinai Peninsula.
Forty-six villagers were killed.
   On Saturday, Palestinian flags were flying from electricity
poles, mosques and churches in West Bank and Gaza Strip towns and
cities.
   Most businesses were closed, transport was at a standstill, and
black smoke curled into the air from burning tires.
   ``Let's burn them on their election day,'' said a slogan in the
city of Bethlehem, referring to the Israeli elections Nov. 1
   In the West Bank, stone-throwing Palestinian youths blocked
Ramallah's Old City for about two hours, Arab sources said. Soldiers
fired in the air.
   Saturday's most violent clash was in the West Bank village of
Rujib. The army said Arab youths blocked a major road near the
village and hurled rocks and bricks at soldiers. The army reported
six wounded, including a youth it said was shot just as he was about
to hurl a brick from a rooftop on a soldier below. Arab hospital
officials put the number of wounded at seven and said one was in
critical condition.
   In the El Ein and Balata refugee camps near Nablus, two
teen-agers were wounded in clashes, officials at Nablus' Ittihad
hospital reported.
   In the West Bank town of Jenin, an 8-year-old boy was shot in the
face and another teen-ager wounded, the officials said.
   The strike also spread to Arab east Jerusalem, where police used
tear gas to break up a demonstration after Arabs blocked off a road
in the Jabaal El-Mukaber neighborhood, police said.
   The Arab Journalists' Association of Jerusalem reported Saturday
that Israeli soldiers arrested 10 Arab journalists and that four
remained in jail.
   A four-page statement the association sent to The Associated
Press in Nicosia, Cyprus, said six of the 10 arrested Friday were
released. It said journalists Nabil al-Joulani, Rida al-Zirbah,
Mahmoud al-Rumhi and Hassan Abdullah were detained.
   The statement appealed to the the international news media to
press Israel to release imprisoned Arab journalists.
   ``Israeli authorities continue to apply their repressive measures
against the press,'' it said.

<HEAD>Austrian President Asks Syria To Extradite Nazi War Criminal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austrian President Kurt Waldheim asked
Syria on Saturday to extradite convicted Nazi war criminal Alois
Brunner, according to the Austria Press Agency.
   It said Waldheim met with President Hafez Assad in Damascus and
told reporters later he raised ``the question of the extradition
request'' and that further talks will be held on the issue.
   Waldheim has been banned from visiting the United States because
of the controversy about his service in the German army in the
Balkans during World War II. He served as a lieutenant in the
intelligence unit of a command accused of atrocities.
   Waldheim, a former secretary-general of the United Nations, has
denied any wrongdoing.
   He is in Syria on an official visit and will leave Monday for
Kuwait. He then will make an unofficial visit to Turkey and return
to Vienna Nov. 3.
   Austrian-born Brunner was convicted in absentia in France in 1954
of taking part in deportation to death camps of more than 120,000
Jews. His extradition is sought by France, West Germany, Austria and
Poland.
   It is believed that Brunner, in his 70s, entered Syria in the
early 1950s. Some U.S. news reports recently said Brunner was acting
as a consultant to the Syrian governmet.
   The Syrian news media made no mention of Brunner in reports on
Waldheim's visit. Newspapers said Waldheim urged Israel to withdraw
from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and called for an
international peace conference on the Middle East.
   Syrian government officials will not discuss Brunner and requests
to interview him are routinely rejected.
   Waldheim, elected president in June 1986, has been shunned by
Western government because of the allegations about his wartime
activities. He has made official trips to Jordan and Pakistan and an
unofficial visit to Vatican.
   Waldheim will meet with President Kenan Evren when he stops in
Turkey, but that visit is listed as unofficial.
   Some Austrian news reports said that Turkey, acting under
pressure from the United States, changed Waldheim's visit from the
capital, Ankara, to the eastern city of Istanbul.
   The Austria Press Agency said Waldheim was asked about the change
and reported he said that ``from the outset a meeting with Turkish
President Kenan Evren'' had been planned but not as a state visit,
and that the site of the meeting was ``meaningless.''

   Actress Brigitte Nielsen does not have cancer but
did have a condition that, if left untreated, might have developed
into cancer, according to test results released Saturday.
   Nielsen told reporters earlier this month that she had cancer of
the uterus. Her fiance, New York Jets All-Pro defensive end Mark
Gastineau, quit the football team, saying he wanted to see Nielsen
through her ordeal.
   Dr. Rochelle Sanders, an Eagar, Ariz., physician who performed a
biopsy Wednesday, said Nielsen had dysplasia, which was treated
during cryosurgery.
   Dysplasia describes a cellular irregularity in the body. It may
or may not be a warning sign for cancer, according to the University
of Arizona's Cancer Center in Tucson.
   Ms. Nielsen's publicist, Joel Brokaw, released the results in Los
Angeles.

   A $5.25 million settlement has been
reached with the Chubb Group of Insurance Cos. and a subsidiary in a
dispute over drought insurance sold to Minnesota farmers last
spring, it was announced Saturday.
   ``All farmers who otherwise would be entitled to benefits under a
policy will receive restitution or compensation under this
settlement,'' said Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch.
   Hatch said about 770 Minnesota farmers may be eligible for
payments under the agreement with the New Jersey-based Chubb and its
subsidiary, Federal Insurance Co.
   The settlement was granted preliminary approval Friday by Steele
County District Judge Frederick Hough, who also certified as a class
action a lawsuit against Chubb and Federal filed on behalf of
Minnesota farmers who were denied drought insurance coverage. The
judge scheduled a Dec. 19 hearing to consider final approval.
   The dispute arose when Chubb sold more drought insurance policies
than it could cover and denied coverage to most of the more than
8,000 Midwestern farmers in Minnesota and nine other states who
bought the policies during the early summer.
   Both Hatch and Brice Gamber, a vice president and regional
manager of Chubb, said the ruling applied only to Minnesota.
   ``The resolution here may be substantially different than what
occurs in other states,'' Hatch said.
   Chubb said it intended to issue only $40 million in coverage and
it considered the remainder of the $400 million worth of policies to
be only applications.
   More than 1,000 Minnesota farmers applied for the coverage, Hatch
said.
   Chubb said it issued 228 policies providing coverage totaling
$8.7 million in Minnesota. Incurred losses, according to Chubb,
amounted to $2.7 million in that state.
   To the remaining Minnesota applicants, Chubb made 773
``goodwill'' payments totaling $1.4 million, the company said. Under
terms of the settlement, those payments and premium costs that were
refunded will be deducted from the reimbursement amount, Hatch said.
   ``Farmers will receive exactly what the benefit bargain was, less
compensation that attorneys involved will receive,'' said Hatch,
estimating that attorney fees would amount to about 5 percent of the
settlement.
   Gamber said the company was ``delighted to have this resolved''
both for the farmers and to avoid protracted legal and
administrative proceedings in Minnesota.
   The company also agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty plus an
additional $50,000 to cover expenses incurred by the Commerce
Department in investigating the drought insurance dispute, Hatch
said.
   Chubb is the nation's 16th-largest property and casualty insurer,
with a net worth of $2.1 billion as of June 30.
   The drought insurance was structured to pay farmers for the lack
of rain between June 1 and Aug. 31, based on a sliding scale.

<TEXT>
   Savannah River Plant inspectors who
monitor radiation exposure have been retrained after two workers
were mistakenly treated for excessive contamination, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   ``This is an extremely unusual occurrence,'' Carol Palmiotto,
plant health protection department supervisor, told the Charleston
Post-Courier on Friday.
   On Oct. 13, two workers at the nuclear weapons production plant
discovered they had picked up some radioactive material on their
clothing, Ms. Palmiotto said.
   The workers apparently picked up the material at one of the
plant's chemical separations facilities and reported it to the
health protection department, she said.
   ``Our initial survey of the individuals indicated that they had
some minimal, low-level contamination in their nasal passages,'' Ms.
Palmiotto said. ``This is determined by what we call nasal smears.
We wipe the area of the nostril with a Q-tip and then put the Q-tip
in some radiation monitoring devices.''
   The employees were referred to the plant medical department and
chelation therapy was initiated, she said.
   Chelation therapy involves the use of an experimental drug called
DTPA, which is manufactured for the Department of Energy by a an Oak
Ridge, Tenn., firm. Before DTPA is administered, the worker must
sign a waiver indicating he or she is aware that the drug is
considered investigational by the federal Food and Drug
Administration.
   ``Subsequent measurements indicated that our initial calculations
were in error,'' Ms. Palmiotto said.
   All health protection department inspectors have been
reinstructed in proper calculation methods since the incident, she
said.
   She said even with the calculation error, the employees had
received minimal, nominal exposure in their nasal passages and that
she believed the plant physician would have ordered the chelation
therapy anyway.
   Dr. George A. Poda, a medical director at the plant until his
retirement in 1986, said chelation therapy is as safe as taking
aspirin and is used whenever contamination is suspected.
   A chelate is a chemical compound that grabs onto something and
holds it in suspension so that it cannot be absorbed into the body,
Poda explained.
   The Aiken, S.C., plant is one of 16 plants nationwide producing
nuclear weapons materials for the Department of Energy. It is the
only site where the main nuclear production materials, plutonium and
tritium, are produced. All three of its reactors have been closed
for safety reasons.

   Texas land developer and Democratic
fund-raiser Thomas Gaubert was found innocent Saturday of fraud
charges stemming from a U.S. Justice Department investigation of a
$32 million loan made in a condominium project.
   Gaubert, 48, tearfuly embraced his son, Mike, after the federal
jury acquitted him of three fraud counts and two counts of making
false statements.
   ``I was never guilty of anything,'' he said.
   Gaubert, a fund-raiser for House Speaker Jim Wright and other
Texas Democrats, was indicted in March in a Justice Department
investigation into Texas land dealings. He was on trial in Iowa
because the case involved the Capitol Savings and Loan Association
of Mount Pleasant.
   Prosecutor Thomas McQuillan, the only member of the prosecution
team in of U.S. District Judge Harold Vietor's courtroom when the
verdict was returned, declined to comment on the jury's decision or
how it would affect the Texas investigations.
   Prosecutors contended Gaubert withheld information that he was
the seller of 44 acres of Dallas land bought by the individuals
obtaining a $32 million loan commitment from the Iowa thrift in
early 1983. They said Gaubert bought property for less than 50 cents
a square foot, and that it was sold that same day for $5.25 a square
foot through a series of transactions that netted him a $5.6 million
profit from the $8 million first installment of the loan.
   Capitol officials testified during the three-week trial they
would not have agreed to the loan if they knew Gaubert was the
seller. Federal regulators said the Gaubert deal is one reason why
the thrift was declared insolvent and later closed.
   Documents on file with the court, but not introduced as evidence
in the criminal trial, showed that despite the initial profit,
Gaubert repaid $7 million to Capitol in 1985 as part of an
out-of-court settlement of civil charges arising from the same
transaction.
   Prosecutor Richard Fishkin portrayed Gaubert during closing
arguments Thursday as a schemer who used Capitol's shaky financial
position to his advantage. He said Gaubert misled Capitol about the
loan, from which the thrift stood to earn millions of dollars in
fees.
   In his closing arguments, defense attorney Abbe Lowell said his
client and Capitol shared several profitable deals and that
Capitol's officers knew, or should have known, all the details of
the controversial loan. He said there was ample documentation for
the directors to learn of Gaubert's involvement had they chosen to
do so.
   ``The jury found no lies, no misrepresentation, no attempt to
hurt a thrift,'' Lowell said.

   Police in at least 26 U.S. cities arrested more than 2,000
anti-abortion demonstrators Saturday as activists tried to close
clinics and stop employees and pregnant women from entering.
   Operation Rescue, the organization that organized the
demonstrations, said a total of 2,212 people were arrested in 27
cities Saturday and in four cities on Friday.
   At many clinics, volunteers helped escort patients through ranks
of protesters. Most clinics said appointments that were not kept
were rescheduled or referred to clinics not being picketed.
   Counter-demonstrators at some sites chanted ``Right to Life, your
name's a lie, you don't care if women die,'' and ``Not the church,
not the state, women will decide their fate.''
   Abortion opponents offered one woman approaching a clinic in
Irvington, N.J., money and shelter to help her raise her child.
``Abortion never makes you un-pregnant. It only makes you the mother
of a dead child,'' she was told.
   Despite the arrests, mostly for blocking access or trespassing,
the demonstrations organized by the New York-based Operation Rescue
were generally peaceful.
   The group organized protests over the weekend in 32 U.S. cities
and said as many as 5,000 people could be arrested.
   Police in Pittsburgh arrested 367 at the nation's third largest
abortion clinic, apparently the largest number arrested in any one
city Saturday.
   About 170 people were arrested in suburban New Orleans, where one
demonstrator yelled ``Save your child! Give your life to Jesus!''
while sheriff's deputies escorted a woman into a clinic.
   In Des Moines, Iowa, a clinic employee was slightly injured when
protesters, thinking she was a patient, dove in her path to stop her
from entering. Police arrested 20 demonstrators.
   ``It doesn't surprise me that this radical fringe element is
breaking the law and causing people to be injured. But this is a
nurse who cares about other people's health problems,'' said clinic
director Jill June.
   Houston police arrested 13 people at a clinic, including one who
chained himself to a heavy metal garbage can. ``This is a violent
place,'' the man said while police worked to free him. ``This is a
place where innocent blood is shed for money.''
   In Providence, R.I., where about 100 were arrested, police said
five officers suffered apparently minor injuries when they tried to
shove through a crowd.
   Atlanta police arrested 40 people, including a man who tried to
stop a police motorcycle from entering clinic property.
Demonstrators there lay in the path of clinic employees' cars
arriving for work.
   Operation Rescue began blocking clinic entrances in Atlanta on
July 19, during the Democratic National Convention. About 7,000
sympathizers have been arrested nationwide since then, 1,200 of them
in Atlanta.
   In Brookline, Mass., Acting Gov. Evelyn Murphy told a rally of
pro-choice demonstrators that only Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
Democratic presidential nominee, would protect their right to a
legal abortion.
   ``We must get up and exercise our choice for the candidate who
believes women have a right to control our bodies. George Bush
believes women are criminals,'' she said. Bush is against abortion.
   ``These people are in the minority and we're not going to let
them usurp the freedoms and rights that we deserve,'' Mickey
Goodrich said at pro-choice rally in Rochester, N.Y. ``I'm here for
the rights of my granddaughter.''
   A pro-choice rally in Austin, Texas, featured a rare public
appearance by the woman who's lawsuit led to legal abortions. Norma
McCorvey filed suit as ``Jane Roe'' in a landmark case that became
known as Roe vs. Wade in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973
that Texas had no right to deny her an abortion.
   Ms. McCorvey said the recent national attention anti-abortionists
have received made her decide to appear at the Capitol rally.
   Police made 227 arrests in Falls Church, Va. Demonstrators also
were arrested in Columbus, Ohio; Deer Park, N.Y.; Dallas; Charlotte,
Chapel Hill and Raleigh, N.C.; Jackson, Miss., and Phoenix.
   In Sunnyvale, Calif., where about 100 arrests were reported,
police dragged one man 50 yards on his belly to a police vehicle.
The roughly 500 abortion opponents exchanged taunts with some 200
pro-choice advocates while police wearing riot gear stood between
the two groups.
   Most cities, however, reported gentle arrest tactics and only
minimal resistance by protesters.
   Atlanta police were widely criticized in early October for rough
tactics used on demonstrators who went limp and refused to walk to
police buses. They were gentler Saturday and carried rather than
dragged those who refused to walk.
   ``Are we walking or riding this morning?'' a grinning sergeant
asked one protester. He got no answer and three officers carried the
woman to the bus.
   Nearly 200 people were arrested Friday in New York, Indiana and
Florida.
   In New York, protesters defied a federal court order against
blocking entrances to clinics, and scores were arrested. A federal
judge said he would fine Operation Rescue if the order were violated.
   ``It's not going to stop us,'' said Jesse Lee of New York City,
an Operation Rescue organizer.
   Jody Buttram-Bassett, director of a clinic in Irvington, N.J.,
where four were arrested, said, ``I feel these people are fanatics
and fanatics are always unreasonable.
   ``This clinic provides other services besides abortions and I
feel bad that the women who want checkups and to make sure their
babies are healthy can't get in here without a hassle.''

<HEAD>Gay Activists Seek to Counter Deukmejian's Support of AIDS Measure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gay activists on Saturday sought to counter
Gov. George Deukmejian's endorsement of a proposition that would
require disclosure of AIDS patients' names, but a co-sponsor of the
measure praised the move.
   ``There is concern that whatever we do we don't want to draw more
attention to the governor's endorsement,'' said Terry Beswick of the
AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power. ``What we want to do is perhaps
draw more attention to those who have come out against the measure,
to make our actions more constructive.''
   Deukmejian announced Friday he would vote in favor of Proposition
102, which would require doctors, blood banks and other institutions
to report to health officers any patients and blood donors they
reasonably feel have been exposed to the human immunodeficiency
virus or who have tested positive for it. The virus causes the
deadly and incurable acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Deukmejian said the measure would ``provide public health
officials with the critical information they need to stop the spread
of AIDS, while maintaining the confidentiality of the doctor-patient
relationship.''
   The governor's announcement triggered protests by nearly 3,000
demonstrators Friday night, who gathered in the predominantly gay
Castro Street neighborhood and marched several miles. Many
protesters fear mandatory reporting would discriminate against
homosexuals, the group most affected by AIDS.
   Health officials also have opposed the initiative, fearing it
would discourage people in high-risk groups from getting tested for
the virus and from volunteering as research subjects.
   ``The outrage was motivated by the fact that so many hundreds of
doctors and health-care workers have said people should vote `no'
and every member of the governor's AIDS advisory council is opposed
to 102,'' said Allen White, a leader of the protest staged by
Mobilization Against AIDS and other groups.
   Anti-tax crusader Paul Gann, the initiative's co-sponsor, praised
the governor for making an ``informed decision.''
   Gann, who tested positive for the HIV virus after open heart
surgery, called the measure ``our best hope to, at long last, begin
the process of identifying, tracing and treating this killer
disease.''

   A judge has returned a 4-year-old girl to the
woman prosecutors once said ``beat, broke and boiled'' her, ruling
that the woman has made great progress since she was convicted of
child abuse two years ago.
   Bertha Flores, 25, has attended parenting and counseling sessions
and has ``cooperated far more than any other parent I've had before
me,'' Circuit Judge Walter Williams said Friday in reuniting Cecilia
with her mother and her father, Jose.
   Mrs. Flores was released from prison seven months ago after
serving a two-year term. At her 1986 trial, she was convicted of
child abuse charges for beating and scalding Cecilia, then 10 months
old. The girl suffered from 13 fractures and second- and
third-degree burns over a third of her body.
   Cecilia's foster mother, Ramona Gonzales, who reared the
youngster along with her own nine children, had wanted to adopt the
girl.
   Lisa Howard, spokeswoman for the Cook County State's Attorney's
office, said prosecutors and the Illinois Department of Children and
Family Service had opposed returning the child to her natural
parents.
   ``We all fought this,'' Ms. Howard said.
   Mrs. Flores' attorney, Phyllis Ryan, maintained that her client
has served her punishment.
   Before Friday's hearing, Mrs. Gonzales said she was the only
mother Cecilia had ever known and had nursed the little girl back to
health.
   ``When you suffer day and night with a child, it's kind of hard
to let her go,'' said Mrs. Gonzales. ``To me, this is my baby.''
   Mrs. Gonzales wanted to take the child to Mississippi when she
and her husband move there next week. However, the law prevents the
family from moving the child out of state.
   ``I'm worried about where Cecilia would go if we don't place her
with her parents,'' the judge said.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Congress Party on Saturday
shifted the location for its memorial ceremony for slain Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi because protesting farmers refused to move
from the planned site.
   The ceremony, scheduled for Monday, was to be held on the Boat
Club lawns in the center of Delhi where major political rallies are
frequently held.
   But tens of thousands of farmers, demanding higher crop prices
and protesting electricity bills, have occupied the lawns since they
began a sit-in Tuesday.
   Congress Party spokesman Ghulam Nabi Azad said the ceremony will
be held instead at the Red Fort comlex to avoid a confrontation with
the farmers.
   Late Saturday, police announced over public address systems near
the Boat Club lawns that the sit in was illegal and ordered
protesters to surrender their weapons.
   Many of the demonstrators were armed with wooden staves, knives
and hand-held implements from their farms.
   A delegation of farmers met Saturday with Home Minister Buta
Singh and other government officials but no agreement was reached.
   The United News of India said that the leader of the Indian
Farmers Union, Mahender Singh Tikait, earlier told the protesters
that the sit-in would continue until the farmers' demands were met.
   UNI quoted Azad as saying, ``We will not allow the solomn
occasion of Indira Gandhi's martyrdom to be marred and we would
rather shift the venue.''
   Preparations for the ceremony, including the construction of a
stage, began at the lawns in central New Delhi more than two weeks
ago.
   Mrs. Gandhi, the leader of the Congress Party for nearly two
decades, was slain on Oct. 31, 1984, in the garden of her residence
by two Sikh bodyguards. The government said the Sikhs killed her in
revenge for the assault she had ordered by army troops on the Sikhs'
holy Golden Temple in the Punjabi city of Amritsar.
   Hundreds of people were killed in the assault, and the government
said that Sikh extremists, seeking a separate Sikh homeland in the
Punjab, had used the temple as an arsenal and fortress.
   Mrs. Gandhi was succeeded as prime minister and head of the
Congress Party by her son, Rajiv Gandhi.

   Another gold rush swept California on Saturday
as the allure of a record $60 million lotto jackpot sent throngs
scrambling to liquor stores, gas stations and supermarkets to buy
tickets.
   From San Diego to the Oregon border, Californians with visions of
the good life snatched up $1 ``Lotto 6-49'' tickets in bunches of
fives, 10s, 100s, even more than 1,000, lottery outlet operators
said.
   The winning numbers were 5, 20, 26, 28, 32 and 39. The bonus
number was 3, which would be combined with tickets carrying five of
the six winning numbers. Those tickets are eligible for a special
prize pool.
   Lottery officials did not know if there was a winner and said
they wouldn't know until Sunday. Regardless, winners would not be
able to collect money until Monday.
   ``I can't stop buying tickets. I kept dreaming last night that
this was my big chance. Maybe I'm sick or something, but I sure am
having fun thinking this might be my big chance,'' said Kevin
Swanson at the Fox Plaza Market in San Francisco. Swanson spent $187
on tickets.
   By Saturday's 8 p.m. drawing, the jackpot hit $60.8 million, a
North American record eclipsing the $55.16 million jackpot in a
Florida lottery last month, said lottery spokesman John Schade.
   Ticket sales resumed for the day at 6 a.m. and by noon 11.4
million were sold. One hour later, the number had jumped to 15.3
million tickets sold, and leaped to 39.5 million at the end of the
day, Schade said.
   The lottery jackpot hit the ceiling because nobody picked the six
winning numbers between 1 and 49 in Wednesday's $33.4 million
lottery. The jackpot rolled over to the Saturday game and grew with
each ticket sale.
   Sales ran well ahead of the pace set in June for California's
record $51.4 million jackpot, a view store owners who operate state
lottery machines wholeheartedly agreed with.
   ``It's just reached a fever pitch. Here, everybody is `O-D-ing'
on the lottery,'' said Daphne Myrann at the Shell gas station in
Lake Isabella, a retirement resort in Kern County.
   ``We haven't had one customer in here this morning who hasn't
played the lottery,'' said Christin Bazzi at Ray's Liquor Center in
San Diego. ``We had one guy who spent $1,040, all for himself. That
guy's some gambler.''
   Sales were so fast at the 7-11 store in Redding, 250 miles
northeast of San Francisco, that manager Lester Meek had to abandon
his accounting and man the cash register. He was considering calling
in a third clerk.
   ``They kind of get a faraway look, like they're preplanning,''
Meek said of ticket buyers. ``I hope they're not letting themselves
in for a big letdown. A lot of them laugh about it, but they're
still buying. It's going to get pretty hairy in here.''
   Tom Licouris, owner of Uncle Tom's Liquors in Fresno, said
customers were buying record numbers of lotto tickets.
   ``It's been real good. We open at 6 a.m. and we had them standing
outside in line already,'' Licouris said.
   In Los Angeles' Chinatown, a steady stream of customers lined up
in front of two lotto machines in George's Liquor.
   ``We expect to sell 25,000, maybe 30,000 tickets today,'' said
owner George Lee. One of the busier lotto venues in the city, the
store sells about 9,000 tickets on an average day, he said.
   ``This is very exciting for the people,'' he said. ``We have
mostly poor people around here so that's a lot of separate sales.''

   The outcome of the two-week effort to free
two California gray whales may never be known as the massive mammals
faced 200 miles of ice-clogged waters on the way to their winter
home.
   Indeed, the sentiment among rescuers Friday was that ignorance
would be bliss if the whales died soon after more than $1 million
and countless hours of labor were spent trying to save them.
   ``A lot of people just didn't want to know'' about their fate,
said federal marine mammal biologist Jim Harvey.
   Rescuers decided against affixing radio transmitters to the
animals. That entailed additional expense, and rescue coordinator
Ron Morris said little scientific knowledge could be gained from
tracking a pair of young, lost whales.

   The two whales that captured the world's attention

   ``In my mind, there's something wrong to save these two whales
while you are destroying the life of the human beings of the
North,'' Aqqaluk Lynge, of the Greenland office of the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference, said Friday at a news conference that
concluded a three-day meeting on arctic cooperation.
   ``To my mind it's a degradation of human values,'' he said.

   UNDATED _ Anti-abortion protesters planned pickets and blockades
at clinics across the country today after their weekend of
demonstrations kicked off with nearly 200 arrests in four states.
   The New York-based Operation Rescue planned demonstrations in 32
U.S. cities and said as many as 5,000 people could be arrested.
   Today's protests marked a continuation of the anti-abortion
campaign that has resulted in about 7,000 arrests nationwide in the
last five months. The campaign began in July during the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, and more than 1,200 people have been
taken into custody in 20 demonstrations in the Georgia capital since
then.

   The Reagan administration has rejected a rice
industry request for a federal investigation of Japanese barriers to
rice imports, averting a political storm in Japan and threatening
one in the United States.
   The decision announced Friday was something of a surprise and was
the first important test of the new, tougher 1988 Omnibus Trade Act
that was designed to help restore the competitiveness of American
goods on foreign markets.
   Disappointed U.S. rice industry officials condemned the decision
and said in a statement that it hoped the new administration to take
office in January ``will be more concerned about promoting U.S.
interests than pleasing foreign governments ...''
   Clayton Yeutter, the special trade representative, said in
announcing the decision to reject a petition of rice growers and
millers that Japan's virtual ban on imported rice was indefensible
and intolerable. He said it would be vigorously challenged, but not
in the bilateral fashion demanded by U.S. rice farmers.

Joan.
   ``Taking advantage of the damage, the trauma, the Yankees have
already ordered the infiltration of 3,000 mercenaries into
Nicaraguan territory,'' Ortega said Friday in a nationwide radio and

   In Washington, State Department press officer Anita Stockman
denied the allegations. ``No U.S. military aid is being provided to
the Contras at this time,'' she said, referring to the rebels.
   Rebel spokesman Bosco Matamoros said in Washington that the
Contras were receiving only U.S. humanitarian aid.

   Lawn darts, blamed for at least three deaths
and several thousand injuries in recent years, probably will be off
the market by Christmas.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted Friday to ban the
game, and commission officials said the restriction could be in
force as early as mid-December.
   The commission also approved safety standards for all-terrain
vehicles which extend the prohibition on sales of three-wheel

   The ban on lawn darts does not include a recall of the games

   Economists are disputing the Reagan
administration's contention that the budget deficit's underlying
trend is downward despite a small increase for 1988.
   The Treasury Department and the White House Office of Management
and Budget reported Friday that the imbalance between revenues and
spending rose to $155.1 billion for the budget year that ended Sept.
30, a $5.4 billion increase over 1987.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in a joint statement with
the OMB, pointed out that several one-time events, including the
phase-in of the new tax law, cut the 1987 deficit and inflated the
1988 budget gap.
   Excluding those special factors, the deficit would have fallen
$31.1 billion between 1987 and 1988, he said, adding, ``The
underlying trend in the deficit ... remains downward.''

   George Bush stands uneasily on the brink of an Electoral College
landslide, with Michael Dukakis picking up strength in several
battleground states according to an Associated Press survey that
permits Democrats to dream of a final-week presidential comeback.
   The 50-state survey shows that Bush leads for as many as 359
electoral votes but has not locked up the 270 that would assure him
a victory. Dukakis leads for just 78 electoral votes. Nine states
offering 101 votes are rated as tossups, including Illinois,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
   The AP survey indicates Bush has maintained Republican strength
in the South and Rocky Mountain West, while Dukakis has failed to
accomplish the same in the industrial states. The survey was based
on polls as well as interviews with politiciasns and political
analysts around the country.
   ``We're spending all our time in states that should be his
(Dukakis') base ... and he's spending none of his time in states
that should be our base,'' says top Bush strategist Lee Atwater.
``That's a campaign manager's dream.''

   The long 1988 campaign, often more negative than enlightening, is
racing to a close with George Bush and Michael Dukakis offering
competing visions of ``a better America,'' and thousands of other
candidates wary of fallout from the presidential race.
   More than 90 million Americans will go to the polls on Nov. 8 to
select a successor to Ronald Reagan, choose one-third of the Senate
and the entire House.
   Twelve states will elect governors. Thousands of other races for
state and local offices as well as scores of initiatives will be on
ballots throughout the country.
   For the Democrats, the prospects were for continued sway over
Congress _ their Senate majority only a longshot risk, their House
control secure. Democrats also were optimistic about adding up to
four governors to their ranks.

   Seconds before the scheduled blast-off, the maiden

trouble with ground equipment. It was the fifth setback this year
for the Soviet space program.
   Soviet officials did not immediately announce when a second
attempt would be made to launch the Buran on its unmanned test
flight.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said scientists at the
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia traced Saturday's snag to
an equipment platform that failed to pull away from the booster
rocket.
   With 51 seconds to go, a computer stopped the countdown because
the booster, known as Energiya, would have hit the platform at

   Federal prosecutors expect to bring the first
indictments in the Pentagon fraud and bribery scandal just one week
after the presidential election and may continue charging people for
up to a year. They won't rule out congressmen as targets of the
investigation.
   Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in suburban Virginia who is
running the multi-state, multi-agency investigation, is well aware
of whispers that the Reagan administration wanted charges delayed
until after Nov. 8 so that Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis wouldn't have them as ammunition against George Bush.
   ``Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to hand down
indictments in the first part of October,'' Hudson said in an
interview at week's end. Indeed, he and his bosses at the Justice
Department had predicted that kind of timetable last June when the
scandal broke with FBI raids on 44 sites coast-to-coast.
   But Hudson said complexity, not politics, pushed the time back.

   The week following the Oct. 22 hurricane revealed massive

slides covered villages. Crops, roads and bridges were washed out.
   More than 100 people died and more than 180,000 were left

   The army is rounding up civilians in the

Burmese who claim to have escaped.
   Eleven people who say they were forced into unpaid labor were
interviewed recently at this base of the Karen rebels. They said
they were arrested in the capital of Rangoon on Oct. 4, tied with
ropes, and threatened with execution if they tried to escape.
   Trucked to frontier areas, they were loaded down with weapons,
ammunition and other military supplies, they said. They said they
were given no food.
   Ku Thein, a 48-year-old man who said he drives a pedal-taxi, said

   ``We want to keep the memory alive,'' said Howard Hay of Boston,
a descendant of accused witch Susanna Martin. ``This type of thing
keeps happening around the world. People keep getting persecuted. I
don't know if we'll ever learn the lesson.''
   He is president of the recently formed Sons and Daughters of the
Victims of Colonial Witch Trials, which has 45 members, all direct
descendants of the trial victims.
   Hay founded the group with Wayne Higley of Stoneham, a descendant
of accused witch Rebecca Nurse. They are members of numerous
genealogical societies and discovered their link to the witch trial
victims while researching their lineage.

   Fifty years after Orson Welles'
fictitious Martians invaded Earth, this town commemorated the
anniversary Saturday with a parade, a carnival and a bronze relief
to mark the ``landing site.''
   Revelers painted themselves green in honor of the 1938 Halloween
eve when the Mercury Theatre of the Air broadcast ``War of the
Worlds'' and unwittingly duped up to 1 million Americans into
believing that the end of the world was at hand.
   Howard Koch, who adapted the H.G. Wells novel for the broadcast,
was the marshal at Saturday's parade.
   He told the crowd that a week before the show he still had not
chosen an invasion site, so he bought a gas station map in New
Jersey, closed his eyes and picked the hamlet of Grovers Mill. He
liked the name because it had an authentic ring to it.
