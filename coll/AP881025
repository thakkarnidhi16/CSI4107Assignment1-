   Democrat Michael Dukakis on Tuesday
denounced a new Republican campaign commercial ridiculing him for
riding in an Army tank and asserted that ``we Democrats are for a
strong defense.''
   The Massachusetts governor toured friendly territory in the San
Francisco suburbs in a state where h found discouraging polls
showing GOP rival George Bush leading in the presidential race.
   Dukakis responded by taking virtually every opportunity to appear
on network television, while refusing to hold a news conference or
take questions from reporters traveling with him.
   He was appearing on ABC's ``Nightline'' program Tuesday night for
a 90-minute interview with Ted Koppel, who was meeting him in
Denver. Dukakis' wife and children appeared on Phil Donahue's
program.
   Aides said Dukakis would be interviewed by Dan Rather on
Thursday's CBS Evening News program in a session expected to last 14
minutes _ extraordinarily long for an evening news show. His running
mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, was to be interviewed on the same
program for eight minutes Wednesday.
   ``Now they've got a tank ad _ has all kinds of misstatements and
outright falsehoods,'' Dukakis said Tuesday. ``We Democrats are for
a strong defense.''
   The Bush campaign's tank ad uses videotape of Dukakis wearing a
helmet and riding in the turrent of an M-1 tank at a defense
contractor's plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., last month, and
suggests that he is weak on defense.
   Dukakis said the tank ad is part of ``the distortions, the lies
and the misrepresentations we've had in this campaign _ and there
have been many.''
   His campaign advisers vigorously denied the Bush ad's contention
that Dukakis opposes virtually every new weapons system.
   Campaign manager Susan Estrich said Dukakis favors the Trident II
missile, the advanced cruise missile, the Seawolf attack submarine,
the C-17 transport aircraft and the YF-22 A@23A advanced
tactical fighter.
   ``There are lies, damn lies and George Bush's commercials,'' she
said.
   Press secretary Dayton Duncan said the ad wrongly claims that
Dukakis opposes the Stealth bomber. ``That's a lie,'' he said. He
also said the governor was wrongly accused of opposing several
missile systems.
   On the second day of Dukakis' tour of Northern California, a new
front-page poll by the Los Angeles Times showed him falling further
behind Bush in this state whose 47 electoral votes are crucial to
the Democrats' chances of victory on Nov. 8.
   The poll showed Bush leading Dukakis among likely voters by 53
percent to 42 percent, with only 4 percent undecided. The survey of
1,376 people had a margin of error or plus or minus four percentage
points.
   Some Dukakis campaign staffers and advisers privately
acknowledged the Times survey was within a few points of their own
figures.
   Battling the perception that California was slipping beyond his
grasp, the Democratic nominee campaigned in the San Francisco Bay
area, one of his strongest pockets of support, before large,
enthusiastic crowds.
   Dukakis addressed about 2,500 people at Diablo Valley College and
toured a day care center affiliated with the two-year community
college. He spoke Monday night at a town meeting in another suburb
and before a raucus crowd of precinct workers crowded into a
gymnasium near Berkeley.
   Dukakis delivered stump speeches laced with populist appeals and
denunciations of Bush campaign tactics.
   Duncan said internal campaign polling showed the complaints about
Bush's campaign tactics were beginning to register among voters.
   ``Our polling shows by overwhelming margins people are blaming
Bush for the negative campaign,'' Duncan said.
   In addition to personal TV appearances by the Democratic
candidates, the campaign bought five minutes of air time on NBC
starting at 9:55 p.m. EDT on Tuesday and repeated a five-minute
commercial aired Saturday night accusing Bush of waging a
fear-and-smear campaign.
   Emerging Tuesday from a 20-minute meeting with local black
ministers and political figures, Dukakis dismissed reporters'
questions about the polls.
   ``We're just going to work hard, and we're going to win,'' he
shouted.

   An Aeroperu plane carrying 69 people crashed
seconds after takeoff Tuesday from an Andes airport and airline
officials said 12 people were killed, including an American and
three Europeans.
   Aeroperu spokesman Freddy Chirinos said 56 people were injured
and one person could not be accounted for.
   Survivors said there was an explosion aboard the Dutch-built
Fokker F-28 just after it departed from the Manco Capac airport at
Juliaca, 540 miles southeast of Lima.
   In a brief communique the state-operated airline said an American
was among the dead and identified him as Douglas Harris, but listed
no hometown. It said other foreigners killed were Kurt Lenz of
Switzerland and Ervert and Ingeborg Psiller of France, but did not
provide hometowns.
   Transportation Minister Camilo Carrillo told reporters in Juliaca
that Fernando Bellina, the pilot of Flight 771, swerved the stricken
craft in an effort to return to the runway but it crashed in a
pasture. Witnesses said the twin-jet plane broke in two and the rear
section burst into flames, and many of the injured suffered burns.
   Officials said an investigation was underway to determine the
cause of the accident.
   In its list of people who perished, the communique said the
bodies of three victims had not been identified and five Peruvians
were killed, including an airline hostess.
   Chirinos said the four dead foreigners were among at least 19
non-Peruvians aboard. He did not have the hometowns of any of the
foreigners.
   He said Caroline Dunning and Katherine Kraus of the United States
and Luana and Rafael Gianinazzi of Italy were hospitalized in Lima
with grave injuries.
   The identified the 11 foreigners treated at the Juliaca hospital
as Francois Savoir, Michael Reilly, Bernard Mahoney and Mark
Krankin, all with U.S. passports; Albert Koyson and Brigitte Kahson
of France; Walter Kabin of Great Britain; Joacy Borge of Brazil, and
Esther and Ana Lopez and Gina Garfias all of Spain.
   Officials at the U.S. Embassy said they had no information about
the American victims.
   The plane was en route from Juliaca to Arequipa, 120 miles
southwest of Juliaca.
   Tourists often take the flight to return from visits to Bolivia's
Lake Titicaca near Juliaca.
   Airline and Puno state officials earlier had given different
casualty figures, saying as many as 22 people had been killed.
Aeroperu president Jose Guerra had said 19 people died.
   Aeroperu said the plane had a capacity load of 65 passengers and
four crew members.
   Police in Juliaca said four Peruvian legislators _ a sentator and
three congressmen _ were among the victims.
   One of the lawmakers, Congressman Rolando Avila told reporters in
Juliaca that the aircraft had traveled only about 400 yards after
takeoff when the lights went out and there was an explosion.
   ``I thought our hour had arrived,'' Avila said. ``Everyone
panicked. The pilots apparently tried to level off to land and the
plane scraped the roofs of some adobe homes before falling near a
small river.''
   Jose Guerra, Aeroperu president, said the plane crashed one
minute after taking off at 10:45 a.m.
   The airline said that within seconds after takeoff the pilot
radioed the Juliaca tower saying the plane was losing altitude, he
was returning and asked for emergency crews to stand by.
   Two months ago the Pilots Association of Aeroperu issued a
statment claiming the airline's planes were in bad shape because of
shortages of spare parts.
   Peru is virtually out of foreign currency reserves because of its
economic crisis and is unable to import equipment for many of its
industries.
   Peru's last major air accident occurred Dec. 9 when a twin-engine
Fokker F-27 crashed off the Pacific coast, killing 44 people
including most of the members of the Lianza Lima soccer team.

<HEAD>Attorney Says Engineer Recruited By Egyptian Defense Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for a rocket expert accused
in a $1 million scheme to smuggle American missile technology to
Egypt said Tuesday that Cairo officials claimed the operation had
been approved by the U.S. government.
   Marcus S. Topel, an attorney for Abdelkader Helmy, an
Egyptian-born U.S. citizen who was a rocket specialist at the
Aerojet Solid Propulsion Company near Sacramento, said the American
government possesses a report from Egyptian officials making that
claim.
   Topel said he is attempting to obtain the document as part of his
defense for Helmy, 40, who is jailed on a no-bail warrant pending a
trial expected to begin next spring.
   Topel said American government documents also support his
contention that his client was recruited by Egypt's defense
minister, Lt. Gen. Abdel-Halim Abu-Ghazala.
   In papers filed Monday in federal District Court in Sacramento,
Topel said Helmy met twice with Abu-Ghazala _ in Cairo in September
1987 and in Washington last March. The papers said the general asked
for Helmy's aid in buying material for an Egyptian military research
and development program.
   Topel identified the program as a joint effort with Argentina and
perhaps other countries to develop medium-range missiles.
   ``Our investigation has shown these meetings did occur,'' Topel
said in a telephone interview from San Francisco. ``We expect at an
appropriate time in trial to provide more than sufficient evidence
that the meetings occurred. ... The appropriate time is not now.''
   Helmy, his wife and another American were charged last June with
money laundering and conspiring illegally to export technology for
sophisticated weapon systems. Two colonels in the Egyptian army also
were accused in the case but claimed diplomatic immunity.
   U.S. authorities claim Helmy received $1 million in payments from
Egyptians for his role involving the illicit export of a substance
called carbon-carbon or carbon composite. The material is a
low-radar-visibility compound used in missile nose cones and Stealth
aircraft.
   They accuse Helmy of belonging to an international export ring
illegally sending sensitive material to Europe and the Middle East.
   Egypt has said it is cooperating with the investigation, but
President Hosni Mubarak has said the Egyptian defendants were guilty
only of procedural errors and had committed no crimes.
   Federal prosecutors have declined comment on the defense
allegations. They have until Nov. 7 to file a formal response in
District Court. A hearing is scheduled for Dec. 1.

<HEAD>World Series Tops Week; `Roseanne' Joins Top 10</HEAD>

   As baseball wrapped up its season, the new
television season started taking place, as evidenced by a weekly
Nielsens list that sported more entertainment shows and few reruns.
   The last three games of the five-game World Series joined ``The
Cosby Show'' to give NBC the top four spots in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
rankings and a substantial victory last week.
   But everybody got a share of the top 10, with ABC adding its new
sitcom ``Roseanne,'' the highest-rated premiere of an ABC comedy
since ``Joanie Loves Chachi'' 6{ years ago.
   CBS won the Sunday movie battle and got a top 10 rating from the
conclusion of the two-part movie ``Jack the Ripper.''
   The final game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Oakland
A's was the week's highest-rated program with a 26.3 rating and 43
share.
   NBC won the week with an average prime-time rating of 18.8 to
ABC's 13.9 and CBS' 12.7.
   A rating point equals 904,000 homes with televisions. The share
is a percentage of sets in use.
   The average rating for NBC's coverage of the Series was 23.7, one
point higher than the first five games of last year's series between
Minnesota and St. Louis.
   The top-rated shows of the week were: ``World Series _ Game 5,''
``The Cosby Show,'' ``World Series _ Game 3'' and ``World Series _
Game 4,'' all on NBC; ``Roseanne'' and ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC;
``NBC Monday Night Movie _ Double Standard;'' ``60 Minutes,'' ``CBS
Sunday Movie _ Jack the Ripper, Part Two'' and ``Murder, She
Wrote,'' CBS.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and the ``CBS Evening News'' tied
for first place in the news category with an average 10.2 and 20
share. ``NBC Nightly News,'' pre-empted by baseball, had an 8.9 and
18.
   ABC's limited-run remake of ``Mission Impossible'' made its debut
at 24th. NBC's new ``Empty Nest'' was 16th. But ``Something Is Out
There,'' based on last season's successful NBC miniseries, ranked
only 42nd.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Bugs Bunny: Battle of
the Video Stars,'' ``Wiseguy special,'' ``48 Hours,'' ``Incredible
Sunday,'' ``Smothers Brothers Special,'' ``MacGyver,'' ``West
57th,'' ``High Risk,'' ``Live! Dick Clark Present'' and ``Simon &
Simon.''

<TEXT>
   A mass killer confined to a psychiatric
hospital since his 1949 rampage in which he gunned down 13 people
can attend music and horticultural therapy sessions in a geriatric
unit, a judge has ruled.
   Howard Unruh, 67, has been hospitalized since Sept. 7, 1949, the
day after he opened fire on motorists and his east Camden neighbors,
dashing through homes and buildings in a murderous rampage.
   Psychiatrists who have periodically reviewed Unruh's case found
him incompetent to stand trial.
   Each year, courts have considered Unruh's hospitalization at
Trenton Psychiatric Hospital. In 1980, Unruh's attorney sought
dismissal of the indictment to permit Unruh's transfer to a less
restrictive facility. Three years later, he was transferred from the
Vroom Building for the criminally insane to an intensive treatment
unit. In 1986, he was granted walking privileges around the grounds.
   In documents submitted Monday, defense attorney James Klein asked
the court to transfer Unruh to a nearby geriatric unit. But during
Tuesday's Superior Court hearing, Klein withdrew his request, asking
only that Unruh be permitted to attend the special therapy sessions.
   Judge I.V. DiMartino granted the request.
   Unruh attended the hearing, appearing to be more alert than in
past court visits. He receives medication to keep his schizophrenia
under control, said his psychiatrist, Dr. Manolo Mempin.
   Mempin said Unruh is the oldest patient in the unit, which houses
29 people, most in their 20s and 30s.
   Audrey Holland, program coordinator in the geriatric unit,
suggested that the violent nature of other patients in the intensive
treatment unit could endanger Unruh.
   ``He's out of place,'' she said. ``The patients are all very
young and aggressive.''
   Dennis Wixted, first assistant prosecutor in Camden County,
opposed any change in Unruh's hospitalization. He called the staff
at the psychiatric hospital ``well-meaning, well-intentioned
therapists who are firmly committed to the belief that no one is
beyond help.''
   ``Some demon went into Unruh's head and locked his mind at a
point where it can no longer be reached,'' Wixted said. ``We're
faced with that reality.''

<HEAD>British Publishing Wrestles With The Age Of The Big Buck</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The genteel world of British publishing is
awakening to the age of the conglomerate and wrestling with the
question of whether books can be sold like bars of soap.
   ``Publishing has become a pitiless world, the stuff of boardroom
battles and heart-rending drama. No place for gentlemen,'' writes
Margaret Pringle in The Independent newspaper.
   ``Publishing was very much a cottage industry here. It's now a
business,'' says Joanna Goldsworthy, a publishing director at
prestigious Victor Gollancz. ``Business people forget that without
authors, they're nothing.''
   Such comments have sparked a heated debate about the place of
corporations, especially American ones, in British publishing, where
dreamy images of a gaslighted Dickensian era linger.
   The big guns deny they are cheapening literature, and few top
authors are complaining about the vastly fatter advances being
offered.
   ``You can find a Dickensian publisher, (but) no one wants to,''
observes London-based American agent Ed Victor. ``It's no good
looking back and being wistful. The old days are gone. You're not
going to go out and buy a Remington typewriter when you can buy a
word processor.''
   The trend toward conglomerates has encouraged some small quality
imprints to take wing, rather as a neighborhood supermarket will
spawn high-quality delicatessens around it.
   ``Were the good old days really all that good?'' said Ian
Chapman, chairman of Collins Publishers, one of Britain's most
acquisitive houses.
   ``Conditions of employment, wages, and salaries were appalling,''
he said at a recent publishers' seminar.
   ``Since the mid-'70s, we've had to look to our laurels and become
much more professional. We're having to recognize that books should
make a return on investment ... (but) they can still have the same
love and care,'' he said.
   There's no shortage of books. In 1987, 59,837 titles were
published in Britain, compared to 36,322 a decade before. But the
increase is in output rather than quality _ hobby and special
interest books rather than in exciting new fiction.
   Meanwhile, the gentleman publisher is becoming a thing of the
past.
   In February 1986, Macmillan in Britain bought the small British
house of Sidgwick and Jackson for 1.75 million pounds (about $2.5
million). One year later, Random House bought the publishing
consortium CVBC for 17.5 million pounds (about $31 million).
   That purchase ended the independence of four noted British
imprints _ Chatto and Windus, Virago, Bodley Head and Jonathan Cape
_ and gave Random House a long-sought British foothold. Virago,
which specializes in feminist literature, bought its way out six
months later and is now 90-percent independent.
   Takeover fever is not exclusively American. Over the past four
years, British-owned Octopus has purchased Methuen, Secker and
Warburg and Heinemann, three London houses esteemed for their
independence and the attention they lavished on their authors.
   British publisher Robert Maxwell has bid unsuccessfully for
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and is now trying to buy Macmillan in the
United States. The two Macmillans have common ancestry but are now
separate companies.
   Meanwhile, the prices paid for books have skyrocketed. Chatto and
Windus bought Michael Holroyd's three-volume biography of George
Bernard Shaw for 625,000 pounds (about $1 million). Novelist Salman
Rushdie left Jonathan Cape for Viking Penguin and a two-book deal
reported at 850,000 pounds (about $1.43 million).
   Penguin, a pioneer of British paperbacks, has also become an
important publishing outlet in the United States.
   Bookshops reflect the changing status in the business. Sleek
chain stores with shopping carts and glaring lights are supplanting
those quiet, musty, idiosyncratic establishments of ``84 Charing
Cross Road,'' where one could browse and lose oneself for an entire
day.
   If literature now represents lucre, some are wondering at what
price.
   ``Authors at the moment are getting rather a raw deal,'' said
Gollancz's Goldsworthy. ``Publishing is becoming so much more of a
business ... (that) publishers are forgetting at their peril that
they need authors.''
   Novelist Malcolm Bradbury agreed that practices had changed since
his first novel, ``Eating People Is Wrong,'' appeared in 1959.
   ``I'm worried,'' the author said in an interview. ``These changes
in ownership may result in remote companies whose prime interest is
not in publishing, but in publishing balance sheets.
   ``The danger will be if we reach a point where commercial
pressures become so intense that publishers can only afford to go
with books that can sell in very large quantities.''
   Octopus' purchase of Secker and Warburg, the imprint that gave
Britain George Orwell, Thomas Mann and Italo Calvino, prompted an
anguished open letter from literary agent Giles Gordon to Punch
Magazine.
   ``Most of our significant literary houses are now shackled and
restricted in the hands of managers, bureaucracies, corporate
strategies,'' Gordon wrote. ``Your shareholders may be pleased. We
readers are appalled. ... I beseech you, think it possible you may
be mistaken.''
   Calls to Octopus for comment were not returned.
   Anthony Burgess, author of ``A Clockwork Orange,'' argued in The
Observer that the United States had set the precedent, and he saw a
dilemma for authors.
   ``The impersonality of the whole proceeding is mitigated, for the
author, by money. But money, strangely enough, cannot easily
compensate for the author's sense of being reduced to a commodity
like soap or peanut butter,'' he wrote.
   Bradbury said that whatever the problems, the changes have
advantages.
   ``The greater commercialization in the system has improved
book-selling no end,'' he said. ``More books are bought, and newish
writers are acquiring audiences through this distribution system at
a far greater speed than they would have done when I started
writing.''
   Meanwhile, bucking the prevailing trend are a few new publishing
houses seeking to fill the void created by the takeovers.
   In September 1986, Nigel Newton launched Bloomsbury Press with 2
million pounds (then about $3 million) in capital, saying the surge
in conglomerates spurred him on.
   Newton said Bloomsbury offered authors a tailor-made service
increasingly unavailable elsewhere. Its fiction list includes both
acclaimed newcomers such as Jeanette Winterson and Mary Flanagan,
and such veterans as Margaret Atwood, John Irving and Paul Bailey.
   One of its first commercial coups was the purchase of British
rights to ``Presumed Innocent,'' American novelist Scott Turow's
best seller.
   But might Bloomsbury itself be taken over?
   ``No, it won't,'' said Newton. ``We've received offers, but are
committed to autonomy.''

   The U.S.-Canada free trade agreement negotiated by
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney dominated the debate Tuesday among
leaders of the three major parties in a critical prelude to the Nov.
21 election.
   Mulroney said the agreement achieved by his Progressive
Conservative Party was central to Canada's future and he described
his rivals' attacks against the pact as ``scare mongering.''
   John Turner of the Liberal Party and Ed Broadbent of the
socialist New Democratic Party criticized Mulroney and then argued
about who had most effectively opposed the agreement.
   The three-hour, English-language debate was broadcast nationally
from Ottawa and followed a three-hour French-language debate Monday
night.
   Mulroney said the agreement, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1,
will allow Canada to move ahead and compete internationally to
assure future prosperity. He challenged his foes to outline an
effective alternative.
   ``They would tear up the free trade agreement and then what? They
offer you nothing but the poverty of protectionism,'' he said.
   Turner again vowed to battle the pact.
   ``This election is not a popularity contest. The issue is the
future of Canada,'' he said. ``He (Mulroney) now wants to turn us
into a pale replica of the United States.''
   Polls early in the campaign that began Oct. 1 generally placed
the Conservatives first, with at least 40 percent of the vote
usually needed for a majority government. Mulroney called the
election Oct. 1 after serving four years of his maximum five-year
term.
   He won a landslide victory in 1984 and is seeking to put together
a second consecutive majority government, which has not happened in
Canada since 1953.
   The New Democrats pushed the Liberals to third in most polls
before the debates. That would be a stunning setback for the party
of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
   Broadbent also strongly attacked the free trade agreement. ``This
deal must be stopped because it takes away our right to make
decisions about our own country in our own way,'' he said.
   Critics of the trade pact say the huge population and economic
power of the United States would force Canada to renounce social
welfare programs and regional development plans.
   ``What we have here is a deal that touches virtually every aspect
of Canadian life,'' Broadbent said.
   Turner said, ``I hope Canadians defeat this deal by defeating Mr.
Mulroney.''
   Mulroney responded by saying Canadians are fully capable of
competing internationally and there was ``not the slightest
justification'' for raising fears of loss of identity or social
protections. ``You've been scare mongering,'' he said.
   The U.S. Senate voted, 83-9, in September in favor of the trade
agreement signed in January by Mulroney and President Reagan.
   In Canada, however, only the elected House of Commons controlled
by the Conservatives passed it. Liberals in the non-elected Senate
balked and kept the agreement bottled up.
   A Mulroney win with a parliamentary majority would let the
world's two largest trading partners proceed to form a North
American free trade zone on Jan. 1, eliminating all tariffs over a
10-year period and dismantling barriers to investment and
competition.
   A Gallup poll published Tuesday by the Toronto Star found support
for the agreement slippng, with 42 percent of Canadians opposed and
34 percent in favor. The others said they had no opinion or neither
supported nor opposed the proposal.

   Journalist Colin Webb says he is steeling himself
for the day when someone says to him at a cocktail party: ``Oh, so
you're in Fleet Street, are you? Banking or insurance?''
   For Webb, editor-in-chief of Press Association, the domestic
British news agency, this ignominy may be close at hand.
   As one newspaper after another flees Fleet Street for modern
plants elsewhere, banks and other financial institutions are moving
in along the thoroughfare and the narrow lanes wending south to the
River Thames and north to Holborn Street.
   The short, crowded street and adjoining warren of crooked alleys
and hidden courtyards, the haunt of Dickens, Pepys and Dr. Johnson,
was once synonymous with the newspaper industry _ noisy, grubby and
exuberant.
   ``The man must have a rare recipe for melancholy, who can be dull
in Fleet Street,'' observed the Victorian essayist Charles Lamb.
   Now, as the capital's fulcrum moves east to the Docklands in
Europe's biggest urban renewal program, Fleet Street is gradually
being absorbed into the neighboring City, London's financial
district.
   The shells of the newspaper buildings remain, largely because the
entire street has been designated a conservation area to retain its
Dickensian character. Behind the facades, however, the presses and
newsrooms are being ripped out and replaced with trading floors and
computers.
   Instead of printers and reporters rushing to meet deadlines, the
street is full of construction workers and lawyers, stockbrokers and
dealmakers.
   Property values and rents have soared as the conglomerates
created by London's blossoming financial markets compete for office
space on the old ``street of ink.''
   The first newspaper to capitalize on the property boom was the
London Evening Standard. Its former home on Shoe Lane was torn down
to make way for the head offices of accountants Coopers and Lybrand.
   In 1984, the Daily Telegraph sold its 1.15 acre site at 135 Fleet
Street, complete with art deco lobby and penthouse lawn and garden.
It is being developed into the European headquarters of Goldman
Sachs, the American investment banking firm.
   News International, which publishes the Sun and News of the World
tabloids, will turn its Bouverie Street site into an office
development.
   The Financial Times' Bracken House headquarters went to the
Japanese construction firm Ohbayashiin in June 1986 for about $230
million.
   The Daily Express, whose black-facaded building still frowns
imposingly over Fleet Street, also is moving out. Only Robert
Maxwell's Mirror Group, publishers of the Daily Mirror, the Sunday
Mirror and the Sunday People, has not yet announced plans to leave.
   Keeping Maxwell company are the news agencies _ The Associated
Press, directly behind the Mirror Building, and Reuters, which
shares the Press Association building.
   Andrew Saint of the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission
said the newspaper industry is the last major one to move out.
   Fleet Street proper begins at Temple Bar, an ancient boundary
marker for the City of London, and until the 18th century the spot
where the severed heads of traitors were displayed.
   Named after the nearby Fleet River that now runs underground, it
was one of medieval London's main east-west routes for travel
between the government at Westminster and commerce in the City.
   To this day, whenever the monarch makes a state visit to the
City, she pauses at Temple Bar for a ceremony with the Lord Mayor.
   The first recorded printer, Wynkyn de Worde, arrived about 1500
and set up shop near Shoe Lane where bookbinders worked. The first
newspaper, The Daily Courant, arrived in 1702.
   Before that, Fleet Street had been a showplace for freaks,
fire-eaters and wild animals.
   Diarist Samuel Pepys reputedly was born in Salisbury Court, just
off Fleet Street, in 1633. Samuel Johnson, the great writer and
lexicographer, lived and worked in the area in the mid-18th century,
and his house in Gough Square is a museum.
   Fleet Street also is home to the Middle Temple, one of four sets
of offices and apartments for senior lawyers known as the Inns of
the Court. Above its entrance at No. 17 Fleet Street the partly
timbered building is one of the few domestic buildings in London to
survive from Shakespeare's time.
   For centuries, journalists have worshipped at Christopher Wren's
splendid St. Bride's church at the foot of the street.
   Pepys was baptized in the church, and the parents of Virginia
Dare, the first English child born in colonial America, were married
here. So were the parents of Edward Winslow, a leader of the Pilgrim
Fathers.
   Lightning knocked eight feet off St. Bride's steeple in 1764, and
among those King George III called in to advise him on repairs was
Benjamin Franklin.
   The church was gutted by World War II bombs and rebuilt with
donations from London newspapers.
   Although some newspapers have moved to new, high-tech premises,
``Fleet Street'' is still used to describe Britain's national press.
   ``I don't think one will have `off-Fleet Street,' like you have
Broadway, off-Broadway,'' Webb said.
   Certain other things never change.
   Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, the pub and restaurant with sawdust
covered floors, rebuilt in 1667 after the great fire of London and
later frequented by Dr. Johnson's crowd, still sells a traditional
roast beef and Yorkshire pudding dinner for about $8.75.
   And at El Vino's, men still must wear ties and women are not
served at the bar.

   The writer has covered the American involvement
in the Persian Gulf from its inception and traveled the gulf from
one end to the other with convoys and aboard U.S. warships. Here is
his report on what the Navy has learned:

<TEXT>
   Emerging from what a senior commander
calls a ``do-it-yourself war'' in the Persian Gulf, the U.S. Navy is
absorbing and, in some cases, already applying lessons learned in a
year of unrelenting tension and sudden bursts of combat.
   Although not a direct participant in the war between Iraq and
Iran, the United States sent warships to ensure freedom of shipping
in the gulf. The Navy found itself committed to its biggest,
costliest mission since Vietnam and by some measures since World War
I.
   Between July 24, 1987 _ when the Kuwaiti supertanker Bridgeton
struck a mine while under U.S. escort _ and the Iraq-Iran cease-fire
on Aug. 20, 1988, Navy ships and aircraft engaged in more than a
dozen armed clashes with Iranian forces and encounters with Iraqi
warplanes.
   Officers say the gulf experience, which included the first combat
use of many computer and weapons systems, could lead to many changes
in operating procedures, shipboard equipment and even a revived
emphasis on survivability in warship design.
   It also is prompting a serious look at more subtle questions such
as stress. Sailors in the gulf were living under a constant state of
high alert and performing the technical tasks of missile warfare.
Officers often had only seconds to make major decisions.
   Official concern about stress was given special impetus by the
July 3 disaster in which the missile cruiser USS Vincennes mistook
an Iranian jetliner for a military attack plane and shot it down,
killing all 290 aboard.
   U.S. investigators said the pressure of first-time combat caused
Vincennes radar operators to misinterpret crucial computer data, and
recommended that stress and the ``human factor'' be studied for
future training purposes.
   Although investigators said the ship's ``Aegis'' radar-weapons
system worked as intended, the system is being modified to feed more
precise information on aircraft threats.
   The Navy also has made or is planning changes in shipboard
emergency procedures, damage control and fire-fighting methods as a
result of the near-sinking of the missile frigates USS Stark and USS
Samuel B. Roberts.
   Thirty-seven crewmen were killed on the Stark when it was hit by
two Iraqi missiles on May 17, 1987, and 10 Roberts' crewmen were
hurt when it was almost ripped in half by an Iranian mine last April
14.
   The gulf inspired the Navy's first use of computer systems to
train officers and crews for a specific combat zone. The computers
simulated gulf geography and tactical situations, with tapes of
actual radio traffic for added realism.
   The United States had kept a small flotilla in the gulf since
1949 but it quadrupled after President Reagan agreed in mid-1987 to
reflag and escort Kuwaiti oil tankers menaced by Iran, which
considered Kuwait an Iraq ally.
   The buildup ultimately reached more than 30 warships in the
region, spurring similar moves by five West European governments.
   Gen. George B. Crist, head of U.S. Central Command and architect
of the operation, said the 600-mile-long gulf, crowded with ships,
oil rigs and besieged by warring neighbors, was a ``learning
experience'' for the Navy, whose strategies are built on long-range
ocean warfare.
   ``It was a real do-it-yourself, come-as-you-are operation,'' said
Crist, whose Florida-based command controls U.S. military activities
in the Middle East. ``There were no books, no doctrine.''
   The Navy, for example, had not run an ocean convoy since World
War II, and the only officers trained for the task were civilian
reservists.
   Teachers, accountants and merchant mariners were recalled to
active duty as liaison officers aboard the Kuwaiti tankers.
   Improvising for ``guerrilla warfare at sea,'' Crist hired
tugboats as temporary mine sweepers and leased two huge barges as
floating combat bases after Arab states rejected U.S. pleas to use
their territory.
   He said the barges, an idea borrowed from Vietnam where American
forces patrolled from bases in enemy-held areas, showed it was
possible to range far afield ``without a tremendous base
infrastructure ... and still project our power.''
   U.S. officers say the ``mobile sea bases'' were instrumental in
discouraging Iranian shipping raids in the northern gulf for seven
months before the cease-fire. Their secret, night-flying Army
helicopters also caught an Iranian minelayer, proving that Tehran
was mining gulf sea lanes.
   Navy ships, built to fight submarines and aircraft, were
ill-equipped to combat Iran's armed speedboats and Chinese-made
Silkworm missiles, considered the main threats to U.S. convoys.
   Gulf-bound warships soon were being fitted with new firepower _
machine guns, a laser-sighted Army tank cannon, and the radar-guided
Phalanx Gatling gun that hurls a storm of shells at incoming
missiles.
   Even before the July 3 Airbus tragedy, some U.S. officers had
criticized the choice of the billion-dollar Vincennes as being too
much ship for the gulf. Aides say, however, that Crist stands by the
decision, which was aimed at countering an Iranian missile threat.
   Some other ideas fizzled or never got started.
   Navy helicopter mine sweepers toiled six months in the gulf's
grueling heat and dust without finding a mine. Vietnam-era river
patrol boats proved useless. Officials twice considered and
abandoned the idea of calling in the U.S. Coast Guard.
   Five dolphins trained in a top-secret Navy project to guard
against underwater sabotage were sent to the gulf, but returned home
after one died from a virus.
   Crist said one of his biggest problems was a command structure in
which the Navy's gulf commander answered to him, while some carrier
groups in the Arabian Sea remained under Pacific fleet jurisdiction.
   To solve the command split, Crist created a unified Joint Task
Force Middle East, directly under his headquarters.
   He said that decision could serve as a model for avoiding future
interservice rivalries in time of crisis.
   ``If you look at it, this low intensity (warfare) is probably
where we're going to be for a long time, and commanders have to be
able to `think joint,' worry about the best the services can make
available, not the parochialism,'' Crist said.

<HEAD>Ungaro Summer Offerings Mostly A Variation Of Last Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Summer sirens in sizzling colors and clinging short
skirts ambled down the runway at Emanuel Ungaro's summer
ready-to-wear show.
   While the rest of Paris is easing up on summer profiles with many
dropped hemlines, Ungaro went his own way _ fitting, draping and
adding little bows to sexy outfits.
   Most of the dozens of looks in Tuesday's long and somewhat
monotonous show were variations on last year's.
   There were countless gorgeous but familiar nipped-waist spencer
jackets with long points, plus plenty of peplums above the
body-hugging skirts. The newer flowing babydoll jackets in hot
colors are easier toppers.
   Varied fabrics were mixed in an outfit, another Ungaro forte. His
new short skirt is shiny red, burgundy or brown patent leather,
teamed up with flowered blouses and jackets.
   Ungaro's flower garden sprouted all kinds of posies, in every
spring color imaginable from pink to robin's egg blue to lime,
fuchsia and amethyst. The decorator's dream prints were heavily
charged with big peonies and roses, but the best flower jackets were
simpler _ white pique sprigged with wild flowers.
   Ungaro's pants are original. Instead of the favorite wide
pantskirt, he chose droopy drawers, long or short fluid harem or
bloomer pants, teamed up with the showy, flowered fitted tops.
Evening wear with plenty of lace and lame was predictably flounced
and elaborate looking, as most of the show did, a dead-ringer for
couture.
   Guy Douvier's styles for Guy Laroche were much simpler and
undoubtedly will be less expensive. This clean-cut collection
featured short skirts, smart pea jackets and long, straight pants or
shorts in red, white and navy nautical lines.
   Careful cut and finish gave blue or grey denim skirts and shorts
suits smooth city elegance. Big color prints burst out here, too, on
flowered strapless bustier sheaths with puff-sleeved boleros. Other
feminine lines in turquoise, fuchsia and yellow were paneled and
wrapped like flower petals. And with all this color, Douvier was
dotty over black polka dots on the hot colors.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer showed a huge group of navy-and-white
nautical outfits, beautifully cut with flowing trousers, and neat
variations on the pea jacket, as well as lots of stripes.
   Scherrer showed full shorts and a striped mini-jersey, but he
usually preferred less leggy looks. A white pique sundress with a
long, swirling skirt and little blue jacket could be a winner.
   There were enough safari outfits and jungle prints here to make a
planter pleased as punch. In desert shades of sand and burnt orange,
or printed in green and violet, they ranged from sexy tulip-draped
skirts to belted but full light cotton bush jackets over ample long
pants.
   For after-hours, Scherrer opted for flowered, draped sheaths or
lacy inspiration in short or long evening dresses of expensive
lingerie inspiration.
   The froths of lace bubbled all over like champagne, including the
soft peach and sky blue dressy evening pyjamas, and bustier dresses
with silk chiffon blazers.
   Scherrer ended the show with navy lame and lurex sailor suits,
quite handsome indeed for the skipper or first mate on the night
watch.
   Valentino also was big on lace. But he didn't seem to know where
to stop, pairing it with chiffon prints and huge swaths of
rhinestone embroidery. On some outfits it looked demure; on others,
it was rather heavy-handed.
   Day wear was more successful, especially the suits _ lean, short
and sleek as only Valentino knows how to make them. He showed very
pure lines in battle-jacket tops, or easily fitted glen plaid or
checked jackets over white pique vests, silk blouses underneath.
   Valentino's favorite trouser line still looked new, straight and
not too full, with a cuff at the ankle. Other trousers included
short, full culottes, lean pedal pushers _ topped by boxy plaid
jackets.
   Erik Mortensen at Balmain was applauded for a collection that
looked both simple and elegant. His idea of the trapeze pants was a
suit in awning stripes of red or green, topped with a neat little
bolero.
   Suits were lean, dressy and short, sometimes cut in diagonal,
two-colored combinations. And Mortensen's clinging ribbed knit
dresses in hot shades of red, orange and yellow were intriguingly
textured with panels of the ribbed knit cut so the ribbing was
placed at several angles all over the dress.

<DATELINE>HYDABURG, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adrian LeCornu leaned against the stump
of a 400-year-old spruce and surveyed the remains of the ancient
forest on a hill near his Indian village.
   Where trees 6 feet in diameter once towered over the mossy forest
floor, acres of stumps and rotten wood now litter the scarred earth.
   ``They say war is hell,'' said LeCornu, Hydaburg's city
administrator. ``Well, logging is not a pretty sight, either.''
   Timber-cutting is nothing new here. A 700-mile web of logging
roads connects this Haida Indian village to the rest of Alaska's
Prince of Wales Island.
   But LeCornu and others who depend on the region's dark forests
and cool waters for subsistence hunting and fishing find it ironic
that the region's most aggressive and destructive logging is being
done by the natives themselves. What is worse, LeCornu said, is that
it may be too late to do anything about it.
   National environmental groups have been crying foul for years
over logging in the old-growth spruce and hemlock forests of
Alaska's 16 million-acre Tongass National Forest, several islands to
the north of Prince of Wales.
   But little is heard about native logging, even though cutting on
native land in Alaska's panhandle has outstripped the Tongass
harvest in each of the last two years. This year, an estimated
15,000 acres of native lands will be cut, compared to about 9,000
acres in the Tongass.
   Leaders of the native corporations say the logging has boosted
the region's economy and caused little environmental damage _ claims
disputed by other natives who say the logging provides temporary
profit and long-term harm.
   Commercial fishermen, environmentalists and state wildlife
biologists also voice concerns but say little can be done to control
native logging. The federal regulations that govern cutting in the
Tongass do not apply to native corporations, the panhandle's major
private landowners.
   Clearcutting, which fells all trees in an area, is the norm here.
But Tongass clearcuts are limited to 100 acres, while cuts on native
lands may stretch across thousands.
   In addition, native loggers are not required to leave buffer
strips of trees along salmon streams or to consider the effects of
logging on wildlife habitat. They may also cut on steeper slopes,
increasing the chance for stream-clogging silt and landslides, said
Jack Gustafson, a biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and
Game.
   ``We've got a new kind of logging,'' Gustafson said. ``A lot of
the long-term effects are not fully known. We have concerns, but we
don't have the authority to change it.''
   The stage was set for native logging with passage of the 1971
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which awarded natives 44
million acres and nearly $1 billion to be managed by 12 regional
corporations and 200 village corporations.
   Logging began eight years ago as southeastern Alaska's one
regional corporation and 12 village corporations started receiving
the 470,000 acres promised them in the act.
   Even corporate leaders were surprised at how fast the trees fell.
   When the timber export market declined sharply in 1981, some
corporations had to log heavily to pay off start-up loans. When
timber prices rose in 1986, logging intensified as corporations
converted assets to cash. Perhaps the strongest incentive to keep
cutting down trees was the 1986 Tax Reform Act, under which native
corporations could sell their operating losses to profitable
corporations in need of tax write-offs.
   The results of accelerated logging are plain to see.
   Twenty miles south of Hydaburg, a 30,000-acre island is being
shaved of old-growth timber. Near the Chichagof Island village of
Hoonah, hillsides ``look like they've been nuked,'' according to
Ernestine Hanlon. The angry villager said logging had destroyed her
favorite spot for collecting the spruce roots she weaves into
baskets.
   The rush to cut has overwhelmed Gustafson and other state
inspectors, who enforce the state's Forest Practices Act and try to
protect salmon streams.
   This summer, in one of the most serious violations, Klukwan
Forest Products Inc. was fined $7,500 and ordered to restore a
500-foot stretch of a salmon stream it had buried under tons of
logs, branches and organic debris.
   Besides noting the potential damage to salmon runs by such
careless logging practices, environmentalists also say clearcuts _
and the young, same-height forests that follow _ threaten Sitka
black-tailed deer, which depend on old trees for protection from
deep snow.
   But the environmentalists have not pressed their concerns,
concentrating instead on the Tongass National Forest.
   ``You have to pick your fights,'' said Bart Koehler, director of
the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. ``There is a better
chance of changing things on public lands than on native lands.''
   That's as it should be, said Richard Harris, a vice president for
Sealaska Corp., the regional native corporation and southeastern
Alaska's biggest private landowner. Private land should not be
subject to the same constraints as public land, he said. Like any
corporation, Sealaska has a responsibility to its shareholders to
maximize profits, he said.
   Not surprisingly, attitudes toward logging in native villages
depend at least partly on how much the villages have gained from
logging.
   Complaints are few in the Prince of Wales Island village of
Kasaan, whose corporation sold its timber rights, invested the money
and now pays an annual $10,000 dividend to each of its 119
shareholders.
   In Hydaburg, the rewards have been smaller, and the opposition to
logging has been greater. When land was being handed out, the
village's Haida Corp. received mostly scrub timber and is just now
struggling out of bankruptcy court.
   Meanwhile, Sealaska and Klukwan Corp., a village corporation
based 300 miles to the north, are heavily cutting more productive
lands near Hydaburg.
   When Sealaska sought to cut trees above Hydaburg's reservoir, the
city council forced one delay after another, worried that logging
would silt up streams and foul its water supply. Sealaska had
planned to cut up to 700 acres in the watershed. It stopped in May
1987, after cutting only 100 acres.
   ``Sealaska probably will never touch the watershed again _ too
much trouble,'' said Hydaburg Mayor Robert Sanderson.
   Recent efforts to regulate native logging have concentrated on
putting more teeth in the state's Forest Practices Act. This summer,
Gov. Steve Cowper appointed a panel to review the law.
   But any changes will come too late to affect most native land.
Several village corporations have exhausted their commercial timber
stands, and the others are expected to run out of trees within three

<HEAD>Prosecutors Ridicule North's Defense That Lies Were OK</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Oliver North offers a ``shocking and cynical''
view of democracy by arguing that his lies to Congress weren't
crimes because other high officials deliberately misled lawmakers,
Iran-Contra prosecutors say.
   Responding to North's motions to dismiss charges he lied about
his covert assistance of Nicaraguan rebels, prosecutors said the
former White House aide's arguments are ``incompatible with the
aspirations of our system of government'' and ``inconsistent with
any but the most jaundiced view of the realities of politics and
government.''
   The spirited attack on North was offered Monday by independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who consented to a defense motion to
dismiss a charge that the former Marine officer and National
Security Council aide obstructed an investigation of who paid for a
$13,800 security fence outside his house.
   Lawyers for the retired Marine lieutenant colonel said any
alleged fabrication of documents in December 1986 to conceal
payments for the fence by arms dealer Richard V. Secord wasn't
obstruction of justice because the Iran-Contra grand jury did not
begin its work for another month.
   While conceding a legal deficiency in one of 16 charges against
North, Walsh's office urged the court to reject a series of defense
motions to dismiss other counts of the indictment.
   Prosecutors disclosed new details about North's destruction of
key National Security Council documents in November 1986 as the
Iran-Contra affair was unraveling.
   North destroyed original copies of so-called ``System IV''
documents at the National Security Council that prosecutors called
``the most sensitive records in the NSC's carefully constructed
system of document control.''
   There is also evidence he purposely withheld from NSC files
original copies of documents that were the ``sole record of the
events and activities described therein,'' prosecutors said.
   They also ridiculed North's defense that he was not warned that
lying to Congress in unsworn statements could result in criminal
prosecution.
   The defense had claimed that North was the first government
official to be prosecuted for alleged falsehoods in unsworn
statements to lawmakers.
   North's lawyers recounted a history of lies to Congress by top
government officials, including Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles' false denial of CIA involvement in a 1958 plot to overthrow
Indonesian President Sukarno.
   Prosecutors said such a rebuttal ``reflects a shocking and
cynical view of the relations between the people's elected
representatives in Congress and officials of the executive branch.''
   North's defense, in effect, is an argument that ``lying is so
ingrained and pervasive a practice in Washington that _ despite
laws clearly making it a crime for ordinary non-office-holding
citizens to make false statements to government agencies _
executive officers lack fair notice that there is not an implicit
exception putting them above such laws,'' prosecutors said in
papers filed in U.S. District Court.
   Among the charges against North is that he drafted false letters
in 1985 to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and
a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee.
   North also is charged with making similarly false statements
during a 1986 briefing to members of the intelligence committee.
   The three 1985 letters, which were signed by then-national
security advisor Robert C. McFarlane, falsely stated that North and
other National Security Council officers were not involved in any
covert efforts to raise money to arm the Contras.
   McFarlane has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of
withholding information from Congress about covert Contra aid by
sending the letters and in testimony in 1986.
   The congressional queries were made following news reports
linking North to covert assistance to the Contras at a time such
aid was banned by the Boland Amendment.
   ``North responded with calculated falsehood, intending to derail
further investigation and generally succeeding,'' prosecutors said
of charges that the former NSC aide drafted letters that falsely
denied his involvement in covert aid and fund-raising.
   ``North could foresee that, when the committees received false
denials and explanations which he intended to offer them, their
predictable responses would be to cease further inquiries in this
area,'' prosecutors said.
   ``North himself was enabled to continue his secret support of
the Contras, which culminated in the illegal corruption of the Iran
initiative,'' prosecutors said, referring to charges that North
conspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the
Contras.
   Prosecutors dismissed North's argument that the diversion was
not illegal on the ground that the government weapons had become
the property of Secord and his former partner, Albert Hakim, when
they were sold to Iran.
   Secord, a co-defendant along with Hakim and former national
security adviser John Poindexter, was a ``sham middleman,'' in a
``classic fraud,'' prosecutors said.
   Separate trials have been ordered for each defendant. No date
has been set for North's trial to begin.

<HEAD>US Government to Invest in African, Caribbean Businesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is preparing to buy into small,
private businesses in some Third World countries as part of an
effort to boost U.S. exports.
   The $10 million to be invested by the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC) was authorized in a little-noticed
bill signed by President Reagan to extend the agency's life and
give it some new roles.
   ``A vital key to increasing our efforts, righting the (U.S.)
trade deficit and creating new domestic job opportunities will be
the rate at which we gain footholds in the developing countries by
establishing a physical presence through direct investment,'' OPIC
President Craig A. Nalen said in a statement Monday.
   OPIC's main role is to insure U.S. industry abroad against the
risk of hostile action by other governments, with the aim of
encouraging American business to invest in the Third World. It is
one of the few government agencies to operate at a profit.
   ``The legislation will permit the corporation to take an equity
position in small-scale projects in sub-Saharan Africa and the
Caribbean Basin,'' Nalen said.
   Rick Hornberg, in charge of OPIC's contacts with Congress, said
the investments can help fledgling businesses by buying some of
their stock and lending money to their owners. The U.S. government
will be allowed to buy no more than 30 percent of the stock in any
company.
   ``When the sponsor of a new business can't raise enough money to
get started, it may be too much of an interest burden for a new
company to borrow it all,'' he said.
   ``The new law enables the U.S. government to supply some of the
capital as an investment, with the expectation that in 10 years or
so, it can sell its shares and get out,'' Hornberg said.
   The program is authorized for four years and Hornberg said he
hoped it would be renewed if successful.
   There is no list of specific countries where the government will
be permitted to invest, but it will be limited to those where OPIC
already operates, he said. That would eliminate Nicaragua and South
Africa.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in the latest auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.0 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 7.45 percent, up from 7.36
percent last week. Another $7.0 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.54 percent, down from 7.55 percent
last week.
   The three-month rate was the highest since the bills sold for
7.69 percent on May 13, 1985. The six-month rate was the lowest
since the bills averaged 7.46 on Oct. 11.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.70 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,811.70 and 7.95 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,618.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 8.12 percent
last week after averaging 8.07 percent the week before.

<HEAD>Administration Planning Currency Talks With Taiwan, South Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is preparing for a
new round of talks with Taiwan and South Korea about what it
considers unfair efforts to bolster their trade balances by
manipulating the value of their currencies.
   The omnibus trade bill passed by Congress this summer required
the Treasury Department to determine if four newly industrialized
Asian countries _ Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong _
are artificially holding down value of their currencies relative to
the dollar.
   The report, delivered to the House and Senate banking committees
on Monday, found that Singapore and Hong Kong, while running large
trade surpluses, impose few restrictions on trade.
   Taiwan and South Korea, however, keep their currencies
artificially low and impose tariffs and other barriers to free
trade, the report said.
   The failure of the Taiwan dollar and Korean won to appreciate
significantly against the U.S. dollar keeps prices of American
exports to those countries high and the price of U.S. imports of
Taiwanese and South Korean products low.
   A senior Treasury official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
noted that the United States has discussed the exchange rate issue
with Tawian and South Korea before, but said the trade bill
represented ``a very significant change in terms of perception.''
   Although it does not specify penalties against countries
manipulating their currencies, the bill requires the administration
to assess the result of the negotiations in six months.
   ``If there's a lack of progress, we will have to report that,''
the official said. The new talks will begin ``as soon as we can
effectively commence the dialogue,'' he said.
   In general, the Treasury Department said it was pleased by the
progress of the United States and its economic allies in
stabilizing exchange rates since the Louvre Accord in February 1987.
   Members of Congress and economists have expressed alarm at the
14 percent rise, at an annual rate, in the value of the dollar from
lows nine months ago, saying it will hamper progress on whittling
down the trade deficit.
   However, the report said the dollar, by rising this year, had
simply rebounded from a drop it characterized as a temporary
overreaction to the October stock market crash and that the dollar
was still lower than before the crash.
   ``It seems unlikely that movements in the dollar so far this
year will significantly alter the outlook for sustained trade ...
improvement,'' it said.
   The report strongly endorsed efforts by Japan, which had the
largest trade surplus with the United States, to stimulate its
economy in an effort to increase import buying.
   It said West Germany, which had the second largest trade surplus
with the United States, has also moved in the right direction, but
said, ``its performance is less striking.''
   Overall, the official predicted the U.S. current account, which
includes trade in merchandise and the flow of investment dollars
across borders, will shrink by $20 billion this year, from a peak
in 1987 of $154 billion.
   The official said the improvement should continue next year, but
declined to say by how much. Many private economists maintain the
deficit will not shrink further without an additional drop in the
dollar.
   Economists worry that the United States' status as the world's
biggest debtor nation _ it owed $368 billion at the end of last
year _ makes it vulnerable to a sharp drops in the value of the
dollar or skyrocketing interest rates should foreigners decided to
pull their money out.
   But the Treasury said ``such concerns are exaggerated or
unwarranted.'' It said the U.S. debt in comparison to the size of
its economy is modest by international standards and said the
United States ``remains an extremely attractive place to invest.''
   In another part of the report, the administration said its
policy of coordinating intervention in currency markets with other
major industrial nations has proved ``more helpful than previously
thought'' in stabilizing exchange rates even though the
interventions were small relative to total currency trading.
   It said the United States spent $8.5 billion to prop up the
value of the dollar as it was falling in 1987 and sold $1.4 billion
in dollars to curb its appreciation this year.

   Two jewels in Australia's musical crown, the
Sydney Symphony and coloratura soprano Dame Joan Sutherland,
presented a brilliant concert for this year's United Nations Day
celebration on Monday night.
   The concert in the General Assembly of the United Nations is an
annual event commemorating the birth of the U.N. on Oct. 24, 1945,
and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar greeted the audience
with a brief statement before the performance.
   The appearance by the Sydney Symphony, Australia's oldest
musical institution, came as it makes its first U.S. tour, which
began Oct. 16 and continues through Nov. 6, part of Australia's
Bicentennial celebrations.
   PBS has televised U.N. Day concerts for 20 years. This year the
concert will air on Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. EDT.
   After three instrumental pieces, conducted by Stuart Challender,
Dame Joan sang some music from the first act of ``La Traviata,''
concluding with ``Sempre libera.'' Her husband, Richard Bonynge,
conducted for her.
   A month before her 63rd birthday, her voice was glorious.
Singing in the opera's original key, she hit every coloratura note
squarely and with apparent ease, hit high notes without scooping up
to them.
   After intermission, she sang the title character's entrance in
``The Merry Widow'' and ``Vilia,'' beautifully sustaining the mood
of that haunting song.
   The concert ended with her singing from ``La Sonnambula,'' one
of the bel canto operas which introduced her to American audiences.
She spun the melodic lines, made perfect delicate trills and was
altogether thrilling.
   The concert began with ``Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks'' by
Richard Strauss. Challender emphasized the lyricism of the music.
The General Assembly, with its wood strips on the walls and wooden
desks, is acoustically warm, abetting the conductor's approach of
making the music sing. Till's rudest pranks were not depicted in
vulgar tones in this presentation.
   Next came ``The Display Suite,'' which Australian composer
Malcolm Williamson took from his 1963 score for the Australian
Ballet about a bird's wooing its mate. The suite is accessible and
pleasing, beginning with an atonal introduction and the bird
represented by a piccolo. A remarkably cheery waltz, sounding
almost Viennese, follows. After that comes rich music for an
unhurried love duet and a mildly percussive finale.
   The orchestra also played Ravel's ``La Valse'' with Challender
emphasizing the shimmer, while keeping tension and flow, and again
downplaying any ominous undercurrents.
   The orchestra sounded fine. Not overwhelmed by the strings, the
brass especially, and also woodwinds and percussion, made the most
of their moments to shine.

   Jose Castillo hacked the husk off a
coconut with an axe and glanced at the skewed remants of his home.
   ``I'm just thinking,'' he said, tipping back his baseball cap.
``I can't just march in there and take my things out. The rest of
it (the house) will come down on my head.''
   Castillo was one of tens of thousands of Atlantic coastal
residents left homeless after Hurricane Joan crashed into Nicaragua
before dawn Saturday. Preliminary figures put casualties from the
hurricane's 24-hour rampage across Nicaragua at 50 people dead and
300,000 homeless.
   On Monday, residents of Bluefields, 180 miles east of the
capital of Managua, began rebuilding their lives. Bluefields has a
population of 38,000 and the storm killed 21 people in the area.
   Some residents picked through rubble seeking prized possessions
or building material.
   The cobblestone streets were littered with piles of wood and
rusted metal. Some women gathered to obtain government-provided
rice, beans, milk and cooking oil.
   ``The soap is already gone,'' said Argentina Casco de Gutierez
as she carried provisions back to what was left of her wooden-plank
home.
   The hurricane winds of more than 125 mph destroyed the wooden
homes, many that dated back to the last century when the so-called
Miskito Coast belonged to Great Britain. A few structures made of
concrete withstood the storm.
   The view from a helicopter of the city showed virtually no roof
unscathed. Most were torn off completely.
   The city's only hospital suffered severe damage but was open
Monday. An official, Reynaldo Aguilar, said 150 Bluefields
residents suffered injuries, mostly shock.
   Pedro Senteno Vale became a father of nine on Sunday when his
wife gave birth to a daughter the day after the hurricane struck.
   ``She doesn't have a name,'' he said of the infant. ``I'm going
to call her Joan.''
   Thousands of people remained in government shelters.
   Many coastal residents waited until shortly before the full
force of the hurricane struck before going to the shelters.
   ``We all held hands so we wouldn't be blown away,'' Castillo
said.
   Aster Gerth, 33, sat on the curb across from the Roman Catholic
Church, a shelter where he and about 800 other people are staying.
He said many of the victims feared looting.
   ``They come at night to go through the things,'' he said of
thieves and then added: ``I'm going to rebuild my home one way or
another. But we need help.''
   Gerth, a fisherman, asked a reporter: ``Do you think the United
States will help? The Russians and the Cubans can't do what the
United States can.''
   President Daniel Ortega, who visited Bluefields Monday, said his
government would accept aid from the United States if it comes
``without conditions.''
   But in Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Ortega was using the tragedy of the storm as propaganda against the
Reagan administration's support of Nicaraguan rebels who have been
fighting the leftist government for seven years.
   He said no request for U.S. aid had been received from the
Nicaraguan government and none was expected.

   A tanker-truck hauling 3,000 gallons of
molasses lost its brakes and overturned, spilling about half its
sticky load onto a highway, police said.
   Route 30's two lanes were closed nearly nine hours after
Wednesday afternoon's accident. To prevent the syrup from running
into highway drains and a reservoir, crews built a dike of logs,
stones and mud. Sawdust and sand also was spread. What was left of
the syrup was hosed down.
   ``For as sticky a problem it is, it's not as bad as it looks,''
said Robert Cammarata, assistant chief of Westmoreland County's
hazardous materials unit.
   The driver of the Baltimore-based P&R Tank Lines Inc. truck
suffered lacerations and was in good condition at Latrobe Area
Hospital, officials said.
   No charges were filed, police said.

his discharge from Walter Reed Army Hospital after minor surgery,
an aide says.
   ``We're going to hold a meeting about the end of the week to see
if he goes back on the campaign trail Saturday, Sunday or Monday,''
administrative assistant Frances Campbell said after Pepper's
release Monday.
   The Democratic chairman of the House Rules Committee entered the

Pepper had a hernia, Campbell said.
   ``He is in very good condition for someone who has had a minor

   Resorts International Inc. could
change hands from one millionaire entrepreneur to another if
entertainer Merv Griffin persuades investors to buy bonds this week.
   Griffin expects to complete the purchase of Resorts
International from developer Donald Trump on or around Nov. 3.
   Griffin will acquire the gaming and real estate company's
casinos in Atlantic City and the Bahamas, and will sell back the
unfinished Taj Majal casino project here to Trump.
   The former talk show host is visiting several U.S. cities this
week to try to persuade investors to buy bonds in his new company.
He needs to raise $325 million through bond sales to buy Resorts.
   Under the deal, Trump would be paid $63 million to break his
lucrative management contract with the casino company. He then
would pay Griffin $273 million to buy back the Taj Mahal.
   ``I'm also getting the airline service and the piers going out
over the water and the land around the Taj Maal,'' Trump said

   A street party by 50,000 ecstatic Dodgers
fans to celebrate their team's unlikely World Series triumph had
pitcher Orel Hershiser quoting Jackie Gleason.
   ``How sweet it is!'' the ace righthander yelled during the
celebration Monday outside City Hall.
   Hershiser, the fall classic's Most Valuable Player, struck out
the final Oakland batter Thursday to win the championship and rack
up his second Series victory.
   ``I want to thank the greatest team that any manager could ever
have,'' said Manager Tommy Lasorda.
   Moments later, he began lurching back and forth in a unique
twist-style dance step. During spring training, he predicted that,
come October, he would be dancing in the streets.
   The party isn't over. On Wednesday, the Dodgers are set for a
White House reception with President Reagan.

   Former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback
Terry Bradshaw was given a clean bill of health following medical
tests for chest pains and will be back in CBS' anchor booth.
   ``Terry has a normal, healthy, 40-year-old heart,'' Dr. David
Carter, who examined Bradshaw at Harris Methodist Hospital in
Bedford, said Monday. ``His blood vessels are excellent and the
test revealed no problems in that area.''
   Bradshaw, who led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles, missed
his last two CBS assignments because of the chest ailment. He is
scheduled to return for Sunday's telecast of the Los Angeles
Rams-New Orleans Saints game.
   The tests found a small amount of scar tissue in the middle of
Bradshaw's chest, but Carter said the condition was not serious.
   ``We'll check him again in a couple of months to make sure he
continues to do well,'' the doctor said.

   Laser surgery is planned this week for Brigitte
Nielsen, whose illness fiancee Mark Gastineau cited as his reason
for quitting pro football, the actress' publicist says.
   Publicist Joel Brokaw said from Los Angeles that Nielsen did not
tell him what her ailment was, but said it was not life-threatening
when he spoke with her Monday afternoon.
   Last week, Nielsen told The New York Times she had cancer of the
uterus and planned to enter an unspecified Arizona hospital on
Monday for a biopsy.
   Brokaw said he had no other information on the surgery.
   Last week, Gastineau announced he was quitting the New York Jets
and football because he wanted to help Nielsen through her illness.
The couple flew to Arizona, where his family lives.
   Gastineau's estranged wife, Lisa, said Sunday she didn't think
her husband was quitting football because of Nielsen's illness and
said he was exaggerating his fiancee's illness.

<HEAD>Former U.S. Marines On A Peace Offensive To Vietnam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The mercy mission of six former Marines to clear
mines in Vietnam is an exchange of good will that the Vietnamese
hope will blossom into diplomatic recognition, an infusion of aid
and the lifting of a trade embargo.
   Three of the Americans who are going on the Jan. 9 mission, Gene
T. Spanos, of Rosemont, Ill.; Robert Dalton, of Davidsonville, Md.;
and Frank Noe, of Stoughton, Mass., were at the Vietnamese mission
to the United Nations on Monday.
   They met with Ambassador Trinh Xuan Lang, head of the Vietnamese
mission, and reviewed their planned nine-day trip to former
battlefields below the Demilitarized Zone, including Khe Sanh where
Marines withstood a 77-day siege in 1968.
   Their sentiments were expressed in a plaque presented to Vietnam
with the inscription: ``In the hopes of preserving the peace, we
come to Vietnam once again, this time to help the preservation of
human life. 11th Engineers January 1989.''
   The humanitarian ``people-to-people'' visit is private and is
being paid for by an anonymous businessman. The other Marines in
the group returning to Vietnam from the 11th Engineer Battalion,
3rd Marine Division, are Nate Genna, of West Roxbury, Mass.;
William Johnson, of Manchester, Conn.; and Mike Wallace, of
Langdon, Kan.
   The mission to verify the Vietnamese claim that they have
removed all of the land mines the Americans planted 20 years ago is
the latest in a series of gestures between the two countries to
improve relations. Vietnam, one of the poorest countries in the
world, badly needs U.S. aid it likely would receive with
normalization of diplomatic relations.
   Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a member of Vietnam's National Assembly and a
key economic adviser, conferred with American businessmen this
month on a rare visit to the United States.
   Oanh said again that Vietnam will withdraw its 100,000 to
120,000 troops from neighboring Cambodia by the end of 1990, a
condition Washington has imposed before it will recognize the Hanoi
government.
   And just last month, the United States and Vietnam began joint
searches for witnesses of wartime plane crashes in efforts to find
the remains of some of the 1,757 Americans missing in action and
presumed dead. The United States says it has no evidence that any
of them are alive but it is seeking an accounting.
   At a joint news conference Monday, Lang said the mines had all
been cleared at the cost of thousands of civilians killed,
particularly from the end of the war in 1975 until 1978 when land
was being cleared for farming and housing.
   Spanos said the 11th Engineers planted about 100,000 mines below
the Demilitarized Zone between 1966 and 1969 and left them intact
when they pulled out. He said American veterans visiting hospitals
in Vietnam had seen children who had been killed and maimed by old
mines.
   ``No one knows for sure,'' said Spanos. ``Basically what
Ambassador Lang has said is true, that a lot of areas have been
cleared, but exactly where these people are still coming up from
being injured, we want to go back, review, walk the terrain, write
our reports and submit our findings to both governments.''
   They will be working with reconstructed battlefield maps and
have asked the Vietnamese for a team of their counterparts to
accompany them.
   The ambassador and Spanos agreed that the most important part of
the mission is a better understanding between the countries.
   ``They are welcome,'' said Lang. ``They return without any
animosity. From the beginning of this year till now, from 60 to 80
American teams have visited Vietnam, journalists, congressmen,
senators, scholars and tourists. These visits will contribute to
better understanding.''
   Spanos said letters of support his team has received from
Americans across the country, veterans and non-veterans, has been
phenomenal.

   Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger
challenged Democratic opponent Hubert H. Humphrey III during a
debate Monday night to stop all negative campaign advertising, and
Humphrey refused.
   Durenberger, in his opening statement during the hour-long
televised debate at Carleton College here, told Humphrey that
Minnesotans don't like nasty ads and are turning off to the
candidates because of them.
   ``Tonight I am taking all my commercials off the air that have
any reference to you, and I'm asking you to do the same thing,''
Durenberger said.
   Humphrey, who has trailed Durenberger by more than 10 percentage
points in all recent independent polls, said he won't stop running
advertisements that focus on the 10-year veteran senator's record.
   ``It's important for the people of Minnesota to know the
record,'' Humphrey, the state attorney general, responded during
the forum sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Minnesota.
   ``The people of Minnesota, you're going to rehire someone, or
you're going to hire someone new,'' Humphrey said.
   Durenberger said after the debate that he would respond to
Humphrey's commercials with paid air time if he has to, but will no
longer run ads such as two recent ones that portrayed Humphrey as
being soft on crime.
   Humphrey told reporters, ``Campaigns are on the record ... and I
wish this would be a nicer campaign, but frankly his record's not
very good for Minnesota.''
   Humphrey focused his attacks on a Senate Ethics Committee
investigation into comments Durenberger made to supporters in 1987
that the committee determined had the appearance of leaking
sensitive national security information. The committee took no
action, but Humphrey said it rebuked Durenberger.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen is bringing his attack on Republican campaign ads
from factories to churches to farmers in hopes of winning a
backlash vote in key states.
   The Texas senator travels today to the Dakotas and to Montana.
It's the first time since a single stop in Minot, N.D., in July
that the Democratic ticket has made an appearance in that region.
   The trip will include a visit to White, S.D., where the Bentsen
family first came to the United States from Denmark. Besides
showing Democratic interest in those states, normally a GOP
stronghold, Bentsen will keep up his strident attacks on the
Republican tactics.
   Those efforts have taken on nearly a missionary zeal, as the
Democrats struggle to come from behind in the final two weeks of
the campaign.
   ``They're bearing false witness against Michael Dukakis,''
Bentsen told a rally at the Greater Paradise Baptist Church in
Little Rock, Ark., on Monday night. ``And we're going to set that
record straight.''
   ``The truth is catching up, and the power of the truth will
prevail,'' said Bentsen, who joined the church in singing ``The
Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
   Bentsen launched his final 16-day campaign push in the
Republican city of Grand Rapids, Mich., on Monday. He told
reporters there the Republican campaign had racial overtones
because of its focus on the case of convicted murderer Willie
Horton Jr., who raped a Maryland woman last year after Horton had
escaped from a Massachusetts prison furlough.
   ``They are obviously dealing with a black man who, in that
instance, had raped a white woman, and that certainly came through
in the ad,'' said Bentsen. Asked what came through, he replied:
``Racism.''
   From the Michigan businessmen, Bentsen flew to Cape Girardeau,
Mo., where he told clothing workers that the Republicans were
trying to distract them from issues where the Democrats had the
more attractive policies _ issues like trade, the minimum wage, and
health insurance.
   In the evening church rally in Little Rock, Bentsen challenged
Bush to ``drop these false ads'' and move on to more substantial
issues. And he addressed the potential Democratic problem of voter
apathy among blacks.
   ``Don't let anyone tell you your vote doesn't count,'' he said.
   North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana haven't voted for a
Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. But
the party believes there is great dissatisfaction there this year
with the Reagan administration's farm policies, GOP nominee George
Bush, and his choice of Dan Quayle as a running mate, said Mike
McCurry, Bentsen's press secretary.
   Although the three states have only 10 electoral votes between
them, the Democrats feel they can make an inroad into the so-called
``electoral lock'' the Republican ticket appears to have on such
states.
   ``We're poaching on what is presumed to be Republican
territory,'' he said.

   A six-story building in Manhattan's Garment
District collapsed Monday, killing one man and injuring at least 10
people, including a woman who was trapped for more than eight hours
in the rubble.
   The collapse caused a major disruption of rail and subway
service and street traffic just before rush hour.
   About eight hours later, a body was pulled from the rubble and
tentatively identified as the building's owner, Frank DeSantos, who
had been last seen on the roof, Police Chief Robert Johnson said.
   Johnson identified the injured woman pulled from the rubble as
Robin Fischer, who was conscious and talking when rescued and was
taken to Bellevue Hospital. She was in critical but stable
condition in the emergency room early Tuesday, said Nick Marletta,
the hospital administrator on duty.
   At midnight, officials believed that all people had been
accounted for, including two earlier thought missing, said Homer
Bishop, chief of operations for the Fire Department. Rescuers
continued clearing the rubble with machines.
   Nine people suffered what were described as minor injuries when
the building's west wall and the interior structure collapsed, Fire
Commissioner Joseph Bruno said.
   Six of the injured were taken to Bellevue Hospital and three to
St. Vincent's. All were reported to be in stable condition.
   Service on most West Side subway lines, the Long Island Rail
Road and the Port Authority's trans-Hudson lines was halted for
more than an hour in response to fire department concerns about
vibrations and noise.
   Jeff Burgos, who watched the collapse from his store across the
street, said: ``It made a sound like a swoosh. ... I watched the
top floors crumble. As they fell, men were actually coming out of
the side of the walls, climbing down the debris. It looked like
they didn't have a choice.''
   The cause of the collapse was not immediately known, but fire
department spokesman Efrain Parrilla said a trench had been dug
along one wall of the building, where it adjoined a parking lot. He
said the wall had been propped up with 2-by-4 boards.
   City Buildings Commissioner Charles M. Smith said there was some
sort of work being done on the building Monday, but he didn't know
the nature of it. He said no permits had been issued, however, and
no plans had been filed for work at the building.
   The building, on West 31st Street, housed a handbag
manufacturing company and other fashion-related businesses.
Parrilla said 13 people were believed to have been in the building
when it collapsed about 3 p.m.
   Tax records show the owner to be a Manhattan company named 63
Associates, which is listed in the telephone book under a different
address, but its telephone service was disconnected.
   Service was temporarily halted on all subway lines running near
the building, which is between Broadway and Fifth Avenue, to reduce
underground vibrations that could cause further collapse and noise
that could hamper searchers.
   In addition, streets around the site were closed, clogging
traffic at the start of the evening rush.
   A little more than an hour after trains were stopped, transit
agencies were told they could begin resuming service as long as
trains did not exceed 10 mph.
   The Transit Authority estimated the disruption was affecting
125,000 people per hour. ``It's a major, major disruption,'' said
spokesman Bob Previdi. ``It's going to be a very long rush hour.''
   The collapse apparently occurred when the wall of the building
fell away and the interior floors tumbled to the ground. What
remained was a partial shell of the building, leading authorities
to worry that the remaining walls might collapse.
   A crane was brought in just before 8 p.m. to pull down the
unstable brick facade of the building so rescue workers could
safely continue to search for the missing people.
   ``It's an immediate danger and a constant threat to rescue
workers,'' said Smith. ``Only air and memory is holding the front
of the building up.'' He said it would take from 24 to 48 hours to
finish going through the rubble.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens may see some Western-style
campaigning for the first time next spring under a draft law that
would permit competing candidates, television time and a campaign
staff.
   The law says candidates for the 2,250 seats in the new Congress
of People's Deputies will be given time off from work to campaign,
free public transportation within their district, and access to the
state-run media.
   They also may ask 10 friends to help them campaign.
   But it seems competing political parties are still out of bounds
and unaffiliated candidates will be restricted in what they can
advocate, since the Constitution defines the Soviet Union as a
socialist nation led by the Communist Party.
   ``The program of the candidate must not contradict the
Constitution or Soviet law,'' says the draft election law published
in weekend newspapers.
   The election proposal is part of an overhaul of the government
proposed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the party conference
in June. The lengthy draft laws are to be debated in the media
before the current Supreme Soviet legislature considers them in
November.
   Traditionally, Soviet elections have had only one candidate for
each position, so campaigning was limited to a biography and a few
nights to meet the candidate. Election officials obtained 99
percent turnouts by persuading busy citizens to have a relative
vote on their behalf.
   Fledgling opposition groups like the Democratic Union may be
restricted by a requirement that candidates for territorial
districts be nominated by workers' groups of at least 500 people.
   But the draft law offers a chance to such large groups as
nationalistic organizations in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia that
have won official approval by advocating not just cultural freedom
but also economic reforms akin to those of Gorbachev.
   Among the groups, the People's Front of Estonia and the
Lithuanian Restructuring Group have said they plan to put forward
candidates.
   The draft law also gives candidates complete immunity from
arrest and prosecution without approval of the Central Election
Commission, a provision that a legal expert writing in the latest
edition of Ogonyok magazine said is necessary to ensure deputies
against unjust persecution.
   ``Imagine an unprotected deputy controls the prosecutor's
office, exposes illegalities, tries to fight the mafia, and
courageously criticizes the police and prosecutors at a session of
the council,'' said A.N. Yakovlev, a professor of law at the
Academy of Sciences.
   ``This cannot be a reality, because tomorrow he will be arrested
on trumped-up charges. And he will have nobody to protect him.''
   In the same article, however, Yakovlev said constitutional and
election reforms will leave the deputies powerless as long as
bureaucrats control the budgets.
   The draft law calls for creation of a new Congress of People's
Deputies that will meet once a year and elect an unstated number of
their members to the Supreme Soviet, the country's parliament. The
congress also will elect the president to a five-year term.
   The congress will consist of three groups of 750 deputies each.
The first two groups, popularly elected, will represent territorial
districts divided by population and by ethnic group. The third
group will be elected by the Communist Party, trade unions,
cooperatives and other organizations.

   A man arrested in an ice cream
parlor robbery is believed to be the ``Underwear Bandit''
responsible for up to 47 holdups, often taking the underwear of his
female victims, authorites said.
   Bruce Lyons, 33, of Moreno Valley, was captured Sunday night
after a high-speed freeway chase and crash about 20 miles southeast
of Los Angeles, said Capt. Thomas Vetter of the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department.
   Lyons' bail was raised from $11,000 to $100,000 after detectives
found 10 pairs of women's underpants in Lyons' car and determined
he resembled the robber described by earlier holdup victims, Vetter
said.
   The bandit, sought in at least 47 recent robberies in Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, preyed on
small businesses, taking money at gunpoint and often forcing women
workers to undress, take off their underwear and perform sex acts
on him, Vetter said.

<TEXT>
   Frozen corpses of two seamen who died during
a doomed Arctic expedition in 1848 contain bacteria that show
unexpected resistance to antibiotics developed more than 120 years
later, scientists say.
   Because there is evidence that lead poisoning killed the men,
the researchers speculate that heavy metal pollutants, not just
overuse of antibiotics, may play a role in creating disease germs
that survive drugs.
   The proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become a
major problem, especially in Third World nations where the drugs
are used indiscriminately, killing vulnerable bacteria and allowing
resistant bacteria to reproduce.
   For example, strains of gonorrhea have become resistant to
spectinomycin, penicillin and tetracycline. The use of antibiotics
to keep livestock healthy also has been blamed for the spread of
drug-resistant salmonella bacteria that cause human food poisoning.
   But medical microbiologist Dr. Kinga Kowalewska-Grochowska said
the study she conducted with colleagues at the University of
Alberta in Edmonton has prompted her to speculate environmental
pollution may spur development of some antibiotic-resistant germs.
   She presented the study Monday during the American Society for
Microbiology's 28th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents
and Chemotherapy, a meeting of 13,000 cancer, AIDS and infectious
disease specialists.
   The bacteria came from the bodies of William Braine and John
Hartnell, two of the 129 men who died in the Canadian Arctic during
Sir John Franklin's doomed 1845-1848 search for a Northwest Passage
connecting the Atlantic and Pacific.
   In 1986, the well-preserved bodies were among three retrieved
from graves in the permafrost on Beechy Island, west of Baffin Bay
in Canada's Northwest Territories, by Canadian anthropologist Owen
Beattie, co-author of the 1987 book ``Frozen in Time: Unlocking the
Secrets of the Franklin Expedition.''
   Six types of ``bacteria lying dormant for over a century were
found in the bowel contents'' of Braine and Hartnell,
Kowalewska-Grochowska said.
   ``The organisms apparently survived 140 years in permafrost.
They grew sufficiently in the laboratory to be identified and
tested for susceptibility to currently used antibiotics.''
   She said two of the six strains of bacteria _ all of which
belong to the Clostridium genus, or group of species _ were found
to be partly resistant to the antibiotics cefoxitin, which was
introduced in 1978, and clindamycin, introduced in 1970.
   The surprising discovery may spur revision of the theory that
the proliferation of bacteria that survive antibiotics is solely
caused by widespread use and abuse of antibiotics that kill
vulnerable germs, she said.
   Starvation, scurvy and cannibalism apparently claimed the lives
of most members of the expedition, she said. The crews sailed from
Britain aboard the HMS Terror and HMS Erebus, then abandoned the
vessels when they became trapped in ice. But high lead levels found
in the three bodies on Beechy Island suggest some of them died from
toxic lead that leaked into food from solder in food tins, she
added.
   Resistance to antibiotics may be induced by the body's reaction
to heavy metals, Kowalewska-Grochowska said, speculating that
``environmental pollution may be contributing to the development of
resistance'' to antibiotics by bacteria.
   ``It's totally speculative,'' said microbiologist Joseph
Kornfeld, a spokesman for the American Society of Microbiology, but
added the hypothesis could be tested by growing modern-day bacteria
with increasing concentrations of lead and determining if they
start to resist antibiotics.
   Kornfeld said some chemical component or structural feature of
modern antibiotics may have existed in 1848, inducing resistance in
the bacteria found in Braine and Hartnell.
   Kowalewska-Grochowska said tissue specimens from the corpses
were kept frozen in sterile containers until bacterial tests were
performed, assuring they really were 140-year-old bacteria. Some
tissues also contained streptococcal bacteria, but those were
identified as modern bacteria, probably from members of Beattie's
team who accidentally sneezed on the bodies, she added.
   The types of Clostridium bacteria found can cause gangrene and
abcesses, while related species cause botulism and tetanus,
Kowalewska-Grochowska said.
   Clindamycin and cefoxitin are used to treat a variety of serious
infections, including of the lungs and bones.
   Many have credited Franklin with discovering the Northwest
Passage, but his ships only reached a point not far from waters
that led to Asia, according to The World Book Encyclopedia, which
says Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen completed the first trip
through the passage in 1906.

   The Washington Times endorsed Republican

Sen. Dan Quayle are ``more likely to promote continued economic
growth and strategic strength.''
   The newspaper praised Bush as the candidate who would ``best
help the United States build upon the prosperity of the 1980s while
preparing for the challenges of the 21st century.''
   The Times also criticized Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis,
who it said ``talks about bedrock values but doesn't seem to

   A spiritual telephone recording that
won't let listeners hang up isn't spreading good will to some of
those receiving the five-minute automated calls.
   Art Hage, pastor of the Hurricane Bible Church, brushes aside
any objections to his messages, which ask recipients to join him in
prayer.
   ``There's always irate people,'' Hage said.
   Asked to comment further, Hage declined, said thank you, and
hung up.
   But the recipients of Hage's prerecorded telephone calls can't
do the same. The pastor's message lasts five minutes and even if
recipients hang up, they won't get a dial tone until the tape is
done.
   ``If the other party refuses to let go of your line when you
hang up, that's abusive,'' said Billy Jack Gregg, consumer advocate
director at the state Public Service Commission.
   The commission's consumer regulation director Meyshi Blair said
she has received one written complaint about Hage's phone calls.

   The dollar closed slightly higher against the
Japanese yen Tuesday, while share prices moderately rebounded on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 126.87 yen, up 0.27 yen from Monday's close
of 126.60 yen. Opening at 127.08 yen, the currency moved in a range
of 126.77-127.20 yen.
   Analysts said some investors who have been selling the dollar
recently purchased the currency to adjust their position ahead of
U.S. third-quarter gross national product figures scheduled for
release Wednesday, and that has been keeping the yen from rising
further.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 57.03-point
loser on Monday, regained 139.95 points, or 0.51 percent, to finish
trading at 27,421.49.
   Share prices rebounded mainly due to the $1.20 per barrel
decline of oil prices in New York, said a dealer with Daiwa
Securities in Tokyo.
   It is widely believed that oil prices fell because last
weekend's meeting of key Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries members failed to produce agreeement on members'
production limits. That increased speculation that the current
worldwide oil glut that has been depressing prices would continue
at least over the short term.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, declaring his uphill
presidential effort ``one for the people of America,'' vowed a
continued assault on Republican campaign tactics and promised to
balance his salvos with discussion of key issues.
   To that end, the Democratic presidential nominee said Monday
night he would improve the nation's secondary schools partly by
tying some federal funding to improved academic performance.
   He offered the plan at a town meeting at Hayward High School,
telling San Francisco Bay area residents, ``I don't know of
anything that cries out more for presidential leadership'' than
education.
   Dukakis was wrapping up a California campaign trip today faced
with a new Los Angeles Times poll that showed him trailing
Republican George Bush by 11 points in the state, which holds the
top Electoral College prize of 47 votes.
   The poll released in today's editions of the Times showed Bush
leading Dukakis 53-42 percent in the state. The Times questioned
1,376 registered voters during the fours days that ended Sunday and
the margin of error was four percentage points.
   The Massachusetts governor arrived in California late Sunday and
campaigned aggressively Monday, beginning in Los Angeles before
traveling to San Diego and then on to San Francisco, Hayward and
San Leandro.
   Dukakis was heading today to Colorado, where he was to campaign
before taping a five-minute network television speech to be aired
tonight. Dukakis also was appearing on ABC's ``Nightline'' and was
spending part of the day preparing for that 90-minute session.
   Many of Dukakis' California events were rallies with precinct
leaders, part of an unprecedented Democratic Party grass roots
effort in this state. He ended his day Monday at one such
gathering, telling cheering supporters that ``either you're all
crazy or we're going to win on the 8th of November.''
   Dukakis saluted the campaign volunteers and promised to close
the campaign with a flourish.
   ``This one is for you,'' he said. ``This one is for the people
of America.''
   For the past week Dukakis has focused on Bush's campaign
tactics, accusing the vice president of distorting Dukakis'
positions and record and using ``outright lies'' as part a
calculated effort to avoid discussion of substantial issues.
   ``I'm bound and determined that over the course of the next two
weeks I'm going to take my case directly to the people of this
country,'' Dukakis told the town meeting in Hayward.
   Dukakis, who trails Bush in national polls as well, acknowledged
his slip was probably fueled by his failure to respond immediately
and aggressively to Bush's attacks.
   ``I'm not going to let him get away with that stuff,'' Dukakis
said. ``I'll see if I can strike a reasonably good balance''
between assailing the Republicans and discussing his proposals.
   His spoke briefly to the meeting about his latest, the secondary
education plan, and aides distributed a position paper outlining
the three-point proposal.
   The plan calls for encouraging improvements in science and
computer teaching by, in part, tying eligibility for certain
federal education funding to progress toward national performance
standards. Also included is a proposal for job placement services
for high school students who decide not to attend college.
   Dukakis issues adviser Thomas Herman said funding levels for the
federal incentives included in the plan would depend on efforts to
reduce the federal budget deficit. Those incentives would include
grants to schools that establish model programs for exceptional and
learning-disabled students.

   Adele S. Simmons, president of Hampshire College
the past 11 years, will become president of the John D. and

grants.
   Simmons on Monday agreed to lead the 10-year-old organization
starting in May. She is replacing the retiring John Corbally, who
has directed the foundation's philanthropic efforts since 1979.
   Simmons, 47, said she will maintain the kind of challenges she
faced at Hampshire, a small, liberal arts college in Amherst, Mass.
   ``The foundation is about as old as Hampshire was when I came,
and the organizational and institutional problems of the second
decade are different from those of the first,'' she said.
   The foundation has assets of $2.5 billion and annual grants of
$127 million, in fields ranging from health, education and
environmental concerns to international peace and cooperation and
mass communications.
   Its genius grants provide upwards of $250,000 for five years
with no conditions to artists, writers, scientists, community
activists and others.

<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama will send representatives
to Geneva in January to hold the Tibetan government-in-exile's
first official talks in four years with Chinese officials, his
office said today.
   Spokesman Lodi Gyari said the exact date has not been set yet.
   The two sides met at Beijing in 1982 and then again in 1984 to
seek to resolve the issue of Tibetan autonomy.
   Gyari said the Dalai Lama would not participate in the talks.
   ``His Holiness will definitely not be present at the talks. He
might be present at a later stage to meet with top Chinese
government officials like Deng Xiao Ping, but not now,'' the
spokesman said.
   The Dalai Lama, god-king of the Tibetans, fled his homeland in
1959 after the Chinese occupation of Tibet and took exile in India,
where he set up a government-in-exile.
   The Tibetan offer of a time and date for official talks came in
response to an offer Sept. 21 by the Chinese government.
   ``The talks will be in early January,'' Sonam Totgyal, a Tibetan
Information Department official. ``We have chosen Geneva,
Switzerland, as the most convenient and neutral venue for the
talks.''
   In the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, monks loyal to the Dalai Lama
led anti-Chinese demonstrations in September and October 1987 and
in March this year. The monks accuse the Chinese government of
undermining Tibetan social and religious customs.
   The human rights group Asia Watch said as many as 50 people died
in the March 5 rioting.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines demanded that the Customs Service
release a $14 million jetliner impounded after agents found 56
pounds of cocaine aboard, saying it is an ally, not an enemy, in
the war against drugs.
   Monday's discovery of a bag of cocaine aboard an L-1011 a day
after it arrived here from Bogota, Colombia, was the fourth drug
confiscation involving an Eastern flight since August.
   The Customs Service said the plane would not be released until
Eastern pays a fine of $896,000 _ or $1,000 an ounce _ and pledges
to improve drug security.
   Eastern executives, who are appealing $13 million in fines from
the three earlier seizures, said they found the latest action
difficult to understand.
   ``We are not an adversary. We are cooperating with the
government,'' said Abraham Azzam, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent hired as the airline's top drug security
officer.
   ``We provided information about the possible shipment of drugs
and we're being punished for providing the information,'' added
airline spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak. ``We don't believe this will
help the good working relationship we have with the federal
agencies.''
   Azzam said the Miami-based airline is spending $3 million on
security, but drug traffickers will continue to use airliners to
transport contraband.
   Agents discovered the cocaine in an orange nylon U.S. Mail bag
with a standard baggage tag. Flight 505 had proceeded from Miami to
New York on Sunday but was seized soon after it made the return
trip Monday, Customs officials said.
   ``We are not asking Eastern Airlines to become a law enforcement
officer,'' said Robert Gomez, assistant district director of the
Customs office at Miami International Airport. ``Someone who has
access to the airline has to be involved here and in Colombia.
   ``The government is not at war with the airlines,'' he added.
``But it's not enough for the government to do it alone.''
   In the four seizures since August, 494 pounds of cocaine has
been found aboard Eastern aircraft. Since March 1982, Customs has
seized 20 planes, a fourth of them private aircraft, at Miami
International Airport, agency spokesman Clif Stallings said.
   Azzam estimated that the latest jet seizure was costing Eastern
$40,000 to $50,000 a day. The carrier has trimmed back
international flights as part of cost-cutting efforts, which
include a plan to lay off 4,000 workers.
   The only other Eastern plane seized by Customs in Miami was in
March 1984, said Stallings.
   Earlier this month, an Eastern plane with 20 pounds of cocaine
aboard was seized in Bogota flying the same route, but was allowed
to leave four hours behind schedule.
   Four months ago, Avianca Airlines of Colombia said it would no
longer haul cargo from Bogota to Miami because of the millions of
dollars in fines it has had to pay in the United States as a result
of cocaine seizures, chiefly from flower shipments.
   No one has been arrested in connection with Monday's seizure,
Customs said.

<TEXT>
   The USS Vincennes came home to an emotional
welcome after a six-month deployment marred by the crew's
accidental downing of an Iranian jetliner over the Persian Gulf,
killing the 290 people aboard.
   ``We're glad to be home, I assure you of that,'' Capt. Will C.
Rogers III said after the guided-missile cruiser docked at San
Diego Naval Station on Monday. ``This is a nice place.''
   Rogers' 400-man crew cheered loudly as he walked down the
gangway. The captain got a kiss, a hug and flowers from his wife,
Sharon.
   After a brief welcoming ceremony, the sailors poured off the
ship into a sea of relatives, friends and fellow servicemen.
   ``Hi, daddy. You're home!'' a little girl said as she waved to
her father.
   Petty Officer 3rd Class Steve Hile of Niles, Mich., got a warm
embrace from his girlfriend, Vallita Lawwill.
   ``I don't even know what we were doing there,'' Hile said.
``It's a tragedy that it happened. But I'm glad I'm home and I'm
alive.''
   The Vincennes mistook the Airbus jetliner for an Iranian F-14
fighter jet when it shot the aircraft down July 3, according to the
official Pentagon report on the tragedy.
   The report concluded that the warship's crew misinterpreted
computer and radar data because of the stress of being in combat
for the first time. At the time, the Vincennes was in a firefight
with several Iranian gunboats.
   Rogers disputed that conclusion Monday. ``It's my opinon that
stress was not a factor,'' he said.
   ``Given all of the information available and in view of the
ongoing continuum of violent and aggressive Iranian action, I was
convinced beyond any doubt that the inbound aircraft was in direct
support of the surface engagement in progress,'' Rogers said.
   ``There, of course, were mistakes made and there always are in
an intense combat environment,'' Rogers said. ``But both my crew
and the system performed basically as designed.
   ``I, as well as my crew, will live with the result of the tragic
loss of civilian lives associated with these actions, tempered only
by the belief I had no other course of action and that any prudent
commanding officer would do the same.''
   Rogers said the fate of the USS Stark, on which 37 sailors died
in an Iraqi missile attack in the Persian Gulf, was in the back of
his mind throughout his ship's mission.
   ``No skipper sails in the gulf without the Stark at least in
your subconscious,'' Rogers said. ``Was it a factor during that
decision process? I don't consciously remember.''
   Responding to a question from an Iranian reporter, Rogers said
he regretted the loss of civilian life.
   The captain said he knew within 90 minutes of ordering two
missiles fired that the downed airplane was a civilian airliner. He
said he later assembled the crew to tell them the news, which they
took quietly.
   ``At first we were all devastated,'' Rogers said. ``It goes
without saying. But I have to look at it, and my crew looks at it,
that given the fact that the airliner made no indication that it
was not a hostile craft, we had no other choice.''

   Professor Abraham Coetzee, chairman of the publications

urging that the film be banned.
   Coetzee said the film was found to be undesirable under a

<TEXT>
   The Art Institute of Chicago has agreed to return
a 1,000-year-old stone carving that Thailand says disappeared from
a sacred temple two decades ago, in hopes of ending a nine-month
international dispute.
   But a Thai group says it won't be satisfied until its government
approves the plan.
   ``We cannot say that it is resolved until complete agreement is
reached between the Art Institute and the Thai government,'' said
Wutisak Lapcharoensap, spokesman of the Thai Vishnu Lintel
Committee, based in suburban Evanston.
   The institute announced Monday it would return the lintel to
Thailand in exchange for a Thai artifact ``of equal artistic
merit'' to be donated by the Chicago-based Elizabeth F. Cheney
Foundation, a philanthropic group that wanted to help resolve the
dispute.
   The lintel, a 2-by-3 foot stone crosspiece designed to fit above
a door or window, depicts the Hindu god Vishnu reclining on water.
It dates to Cambodia's Khmer dynasty from A.D. 805-1250.
   It disappeared from the Phnom Rung temple, a national monument
in northeastern Thailand during the 1960s, Thai officials say.
   The lintel was first displayed at the institute 21 years ago.
But museum officials said they did not learn until February that
the Thai government wanted it returned for the temple's restoration.
   Thai demonstrators protested outside the museum earlier this
year, hoping to have the lintel returned in time for reopening
ceremonies at the Thai temple in May.
   Museum spokeswoman Virginia Voedisch said Thai officials had
been told of the decision to return the lintel, but she did not
think an official response had been received by the institute.
   Monday's announcement came a day before a Thai representative
and others demanding the lintel were scheduled to testify at a City
Council committee meeting, Lapcharoensap said.
   He said the meeting would be held today despite the announcement.
   Lapcharoensap said the institute had said earlier it wanted to
return the lintel, but nothing was done.
   ``If I have some skepticism, it's justified,''' he said.
   The institute said it got the lintel from the Chicago-based
Alsdorf Foundation, which acquired it in 1967 through a New York
art dealer. The institute said the New York dealer had purchased
the carving from a dealer in Bangkok in 1966, where it was offered
for sale on the open market.
   The museum said it agreed to return the lintel, with the help of
the Cheney foundation, to ``resolve the stalemate in negotiations
and maintain the positive relationship that existed between
Thailand and the United States.''
   ``We are pleased to resolve this issue,'' said James N. Wood,
the institute's director. ``This solution meets our requirement for
just compensation.''
   Ms. Voedisch said museum and Cheney foundation officials would
have to agree on the piece to be donated in exchange for the
lintel, and that a decision was expected soon.
   ``Upon receipt of this gift, the Art Institute will relinquish
all rights and title to the lintel and donate it to Thailand,'' the
museum said.

   Garfield pined for the comforts of home while outdoors in a
rainstorm, and Marmaduke invited homeless dogs to his house for
breakfast as cartoonists focused on the plight of the needy in
today's comic pages.
   More than 100 comic-strip and editorial cartoonists, including
the creators of ``Garfield'' and ``Marmaduke,'' participated.
   ``The goal of the project is to tug at America's heart strings
through its funny bones. Tomorrow's funny pages are not going to be
so funny,'' Barry Zigas, of the National Low Income Housing
Coalition, said during a news conference Monday in Washington.
   Some of the cartoons had a serious tone. Others found a humorous
tilt to a not-so-funny issue. In ``The Lockhorns'' a suited-man
tells a homeless man cooking over a fire, ``I'd ask you home for a
good home-cooked meal but you're better off here.''
   ``It's not going to change things overnight; it's just one more
expression of the movement,'' said cartoonist Mell Lazarus, who
draws the comic strip ``Momma.''
   In his strip, Momma's son raids her refrigerator because he
doesn't have any food at his apartment. Momma tells him, ``Francis,
do you realize there are people in this country who are totally
homeless, while you have two of them?''
   ``If a kid tells his parents, `Hey look. All the comics are
about homeless people today,' we will at least have raised their
consciousness,'' Lazarus said Monday in Los Angeles.
   In ``The Family Circus'', by Bil Keane, a youngster asks about a
homeless man sleeping on a bench, `But, if he doesn't have a home,
how can his children come for a visit?''
   Paul Conrad, editorial cartoonist for the Los Angeles Times,
said, ``I'm participating because I'm trying to attract attention
to the homeless, but I've been drawing about the homeless for years
and so far it hasn't had any effect.'' His cartoon on the homeless
will appear later this week.
   In the Boston Herald, editorial cartoonist Jerry Holbert showed
a homeless man on a park bench covered with newspapers advertising
expensive houses.
   The Atlanta Constitution's Doug Marlette, winner of this year's
Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartoons, showed a group of street
people with the U.S. Capitol in the distance. The caption reads:
``Land of the Free, Homeless of the Brave.''
   In The Miami Herald, editorial cartoonist Jim Morin drew a
bedraggled man slumped in a doorway flanked by shopping bags
overflowing with clothes. Near the door is a sign with the message:
``Home is where the heart isn't.''
   Bill DeOre, of The Dallas Morning News, fashioned a weather face
formed by the words: mentally ill; jobless; addiction; illiteracy.
   Zigas, noting that there are no official counts of the number of
homeless, said national estimates range from 350,000 to more than 3
million.
   ``Hunger and homelessness are not partisan issues, they are
human tragedies that deserve our immediate attention,'' said Zigas,
an organizer of the cartoonists' effort.
   ``There is a shameful level of hunger in the United States,
although it is not as visible as homelessness,'' added Robert Fersh
of the Food Research Action Center.
   Millions more than that are hungry, Fersh said, adding that
children make up a large share of those without enough to eat.
   Other cartoonists participating included Garry Trudeau, author
of ``Doonesbury;'' Dik Browne, creator of ``Hagar the Horrible;''
``B.C.'' artist Johnny Hart; and Tom Batiuk, developer of
``Crankshaft.''

<HEAD>NLRB Rejects Harvard's Claims On Union Vote Tactics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Union officials at Harvard University
celebrated after a judge dismissed the school's attempt to overturn
a vote to form a 3,400-member union for technical and clerical
workers.
   The Ivy League school, however, insisted it has done nothing
wrong.
   In a harshly worded opinion Monday, a National Labor Relations
Board administrative law judge rejected the university's claim that
labor organizers illegally coerced ``yes'' votes through a
coordinated campaign to assure that union supporters cast ballots.
   The judge, Joel A. Harmatz, certified the Harvard Union of
Clerical and Technical Workers as the winner of the May ballot.
   ``We feel great about it,'' union director Kristine Rondeau
said. ``We knew we were right, but we always were cautious about
predicting the inevitability of our win.''
   The union, an affiliate of the 1 million-member American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, won the
election on a 1,530-1,486 vote in which more than 90 percent of
eligible workers cast ballots.
   ``The allegations do not suggest that the election was beclouded
by threats, violence, vandalism, reprisals or the traditional forms
of voter intimidation,'' Harmatz wrote. ``Indeed, none of the
conduct subject to litigation in this proceeding would constitute
an unfair labor practice.''
   Harvard's brief in the case, Harmatz said, ``is replete with
misinterpretations of the record'' of eight days of hearings the
NLRB held in August on the university's charges.
   ``Because these references either are not supported by, or
grossly overstate the proven facts, this decision seeks to, at this
level, bring a halt to this approach,'' the judge said.
   Harvard spokeswoman Marjorie Heffron said no decision has been
made on whether to appeal Harmatz's ruling to the full five-member
board. Under the law, it has two weeks to file an appeal.
   ``The university's position is sound, and the union acted
improperly,'' Harvard Vice President for Finance Robert Scott said
in a statement. ``It is plain that the opinion (by Harmatz) does
not accurately reflect the record of the hearings in many
respects.''
   The union drive, which began in 1975, and the university's
challenge had been viewed by several labor leaders as a major test
of their ability to organize educated, white- and gray-collar
technical workers who are assuming a greater proportion of the
workforce.
   AFSCME President Gerald McEntee said Monday that the election,
and the NLRB action upholding the results, was crucial for AFSCME
and as ``a test case for the labor movement as a whole.''
   ``The issues raised in this campaign were the issues that affect
the workforce of today and tomorrow _ job and family issues that
include affordable, quality child care, decent pensions and
benefits and flexibility in hours of work,'' he said.
   In the NLRB hearings, Harvard alleged that union organizers
harassed employees about voting, checked names of employees off a
master list of supporters, paid airline tickets for vacationing
workers to return to Cambridge to vote and ``systematically
interrogated'' workers on their intentions.
   Harmatz said the allegations concerned ``a perfectly legitimate,
apparently successful, tactical maneuver'' by the union to win
maximum support.
   The university ran its own aggressive campaign against
unionization that included appeals from Harvard President Derek Bok.

<HEAD>Snow, Rain Hit Great Lakes Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Light snow and rain fell in the Great Lakes region early today
but most of the rest of the country was dry.
   Cold air flowing across warm lake waters generated snow and rain
south of most of the Great Lakes. Snow and rain fell in northeast
Ohio, western New York state and lower Michigan. Snow also fell in
upper Michigan south of Lake Superior.
   Elsewhere, light rain was scattered over northeast Nebraska and
Florida. There was light rain and fog in Maine, and dense fog along
the northern California coast reduced visibility to an eighth of a
mile at Arcata and Eureka. Fog also formed along the southern
California coast.
   The rest of the country was mostly dry.
   Today's forecast called for brisk northwest winds to produce
snow along the eastern shores of the Great Lakes. Scattered rain
was predicted for northern New England and the northern and central
Appalachians, as well as Washington state and parts of Oregon.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 30s in upper Michigan, northern
Wisconsin, Minnesota and North Dakota; in the 40s and 50s from New
England and the Great Lakes through the central Appalachians and
the central Plains to the northern Rockies and Washington state; in
the 80s in the southern halves of Florida and Texas; and from 85 to
95 degrees in the desert Southwest and the inland valleys of
California. Highs elsewhere were forecast to be in the 60s and 70s.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 18 degrees at Devils
Lake, N.D., to 78 degrees at Corpus Christi, Texas, Naval Air
Station.

<HEAD>Curfew In Capital, Bomb Toll Rises To 8; Police Charge Protesters</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with police charging

<TEXT>
   A strict curfew confined most
residents of this capital to their homes today while, elsewhere on
the island, police fired tear gas and charged with batons into
thousands of anti-government demonstrators.
   Authorities imposed the curfew in Colombo and surrounding areas
after a bomb killed eight people Monday at governing party meeting
in the capital.
   They said the move was necessary because of reports the People's
Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group, was planning an
all-day strike. The government said it feared a strike would
trigger more violence.
   Police initially blamed the front for the Monday night bombing
at a Colombo home where members of President Junius R.
Jayewardene's United National Party, also predominantly Sinhalese,
were meeting.
   But party officials said today they had not ruled out the
possibility the bomb was the work of opposition political parties.
   Violence has escalated with the approach of presidential
elections scheduled for Dec. 19.
   The People's Liberation Front has accused the
Sinhalese-dominated government of making too many concessions to
the Tamil ethnic minority seeking a separate homeland in northern
and eastern Sri Lanka.
   In the town of Medawachchiya, about 90 miles northeast of
Colombo, police today dispersed 3,000 protesters, including many
Buddhist monks and schoolchildren demanding the government's
resignation.
   In Welimada, about 70 miles east of the capital, about 5,000
people sat down on public highways and refused to move, officials
said. Police were unable to disperse them, officials said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries in the protests.
   Police at Colombo General Hospital said the death toll in the
bombing Monday rose to eight after three more people died of their
wounds today. At least 40 others were injured, they added.
   Police said two men on a motorcycle flung two pipes packed with
explosives into the crowd at Kotehena, 2 miles north of the city
center, but only one of the bombs exploded.
   The victims have not been identified, because the curfew
prevented relatives from going to the hospital morgue to view the
remains. But preliminary reports by police indicated most of the
dead and the most seriously injured were local members of the
United National Party.
   The curfew was imposed at midnight Monday and was to remain in
effect until 6 p.m. today. A senior Defense Ministry official said
the National Security Council would meet in emergency session later
today to decide whether to extend it.
   Streets in the capital were virtually deserted during the day.
Police passes were required for anyone desiring to leave home,
except for people seeking to buy food at shops near their homes,
according to authorities.
   The People's Liberation Front has put up posters in Colombo and
other parts of the country demanding Jayewardene's resignation,
abrogation of a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil revolt, and
the withdrawal of 47,000 Indian soldiers deployed in Sri Lanka to
enforce the accord.
   Under the Indian-brokered accord, Tamils were to receive a
measure of autonomy if Tamil rebels surrendered their arms and
stopped attacking Sri Lankan troops and Sinhalese civilians. The
rebels refused and have been battling the Indian peacekeepers for
more than a year.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
They claim they are discriminated against in employment, education
and through use of the Sinhalese language. Sinhalese, who account
for 75 percent of the population, control most top government and
military posts.
   India became involved in the internal affairs of its island
neighbor because of India's role as a regional power and the
political clout of its own Tamil minority of 60 million.

<HEAD>Colorado Governor Sets Limit On Finding Site For Radioactive
Wastes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Roy Romer says federal officials have four
months to find a disposal site for low-level nuclear waste from the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant or he'll try to close the plant
until another site is found.
   ``I don't want to give anybody any indication whatsoever that
they can turn a temporary storage situation into a permanent one,''
Romer said Monday. ``The Department of Energy needs to find a
solution to this.''
   The governor's remarks came as a boxcar of low-level radioactive
waste was returned to the Rocky Flats plant, about 16 miles
northwest of Denver. The boxcar was headed for a temporary storage
site in Idaho but Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus sent it back Saturday,
and banned further shipments to his state.
   Under a state permit, up to 1,600 cubic yards of solid waste can
be stored at the Department of Energy plant, which make plutonium
triggers for nuclear warheads. It will take the plant about four
months to reach that storage capacity.
   Between now and then, Romer said, DOE officials must find
another place to store Rocky Flats waste. If they don't, he said,
he will move to shut down the plant.
   DOE had planned to transfer the waste from the temporary site in
Idaho to a permanent site in New Mexico. The opening of the New
Mexico site has been delayed until early next year.
   ``We'll cooperate with the DOE to find an alternative site until
New Mexico is open,'' Romer said. ``But I've said, `Look, no
expansion of Rocky Flats.'''
   Romer said he would press for a meeting of Western governors to
discuss a long-term solution to the problem and planned to talk to
DOE officials in the meantime.
   On Sunday, Romer rejected a DOE request to expand storage
facilities for low-level radioactive waste at Rocky Flats and asked
that DOE not unload the rail car, which contains 140 55-gallon
drums of waste.

<HEAD>Pharmacist Testifies About Drug Prescriptions For Pilot In 1985
Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pharmacist testified that he filled
prescriptions for several drugs, including an anti-anxiety drug and
a muscle relaxant, for the pilot of Delta jetliner that crashed in
1985.
   Pharmacist Larry Thomas, testifying in a lawsuit brought by
Delta Air Lines against the government, said he filled
prescriptions for Captain Edward M. Connors from 1983 until shortly
before Delta Flight 191 crashed Aug. 2, 1985 at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport. Connors was among 137 people who were killed.
   Thomas said Monday that the drugs Connors obtained from his
pharmacy included Stelazine, an anti-anxiety drug, and Robaxin, a
muscle relaxant.
   The pharmacist said his pharmacy filled a prescription for
Stelazine on several occasions between Sept. 21, 1982, and June 24,
1985.
   Delta sued the government contending air traffic controllers and
weather forecasters failed to warn the flight's crew of a severe
thunderstorm in the landing path.
   Miami pharmacist Gerald Warshofsky, in a deposition presented to
U.S. District Judge David O. Belew, said that he filled
prescriptions for Connors for drugs, including the tranquilizer
Valium and the painkiller Percodan.
   Federal Aviation Administration attorney Mark Bury told the
judge the government will attempt to prove that Connors also had
been taking Dalmane, a depressant used to treat insomnia, and
several antihistamines for long periods before the crash.
   Delta attorney John Martin objected to raising the drug issue,
which government lawyers say will take about two weeks to present.
   ``To spend two weeks on an issue that could not possibly have
been the cause of the accident is a waste of the court's time,''
Martin said.
   Lawyers for the airline contend that the drug issue is
irrelevant because the co-pilot, not Connors, was flying the plane
at the time it crashed while attempting to land during a
thunderstorm on a flight from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   Bury said the issues raises serious questions about Connors'
judgment. He noted that Connors did not disclose his use of the
drugs to the FAA as required.
   Delta attorney Maureen Murry said Connors had provided the
government with enough information and the government could have
obtained more if it wanted to.

<TEXT>
   A man paralyzed from the waist down
when his parked car was rammed by another vehicle has lost a
lawsuit because he was not wearing a seat belt when he was injured.
   ``The ruling was a one-time decision due to the insurance policy
clause which mandates wearing a seat belt even if the car is parked
and the motor off. It does not apply to the overall seat belt
law,'' Hamm court spokesman Karl-Heinz Heugemann said today.
   West German law requires all passengers in private cars to wear
seat belts when the motor is running.
   Heugemann said the court decision only involved special daily
insurance payments to the injured man during his stay in the
hospital, ``which amounted to about 5,000 marks ($2,777).''
   His hospital and medical care payments were not affected by the
insurance clause, said Heugemann.
   Heugemann said the man was paralyzed in an accident at a service
station while he was waiting in his parked car with the motor off.
   ``He wasn't wearing a seat belt, and another vehicle hit his car
while he was waiting for the service station to open,'' said
Heugemann.
   He declined to provide the name of the man involved in the case,
or say when he was injured.

   The U.S. Army said today it was investigating
members of the Green Berets after a military court convicted a
sergeant of plotting to kill a Green Beret captain in Thailand.
   The U.S. military court on Okinawa convicted Sgt. Maj. Edward J.
Gleason Jr. of solicitation to commit murder and sentenced him
Friday to seven years in prison, reduction in rank to private and
forfeiture of all pay and allowances.
   The general court-martial found Gleason, 45, a Vietnam veteran
with 26 years in uniform, guilty of plotting to kill Capt. Paul
Dumpson, a fellow member of the Okinawa-based First Battalion,
First Special Forces Group.
   The Pacific Stars And Stripes, an army-authorized newspaper,
published the first news of the court-martial and said the case
``fueled rumors here that Special Forces soldiers were smuggling
guns, gold and drugs.''
   Asked to comment on the report, the U.S. Army headquarters in
Japan declined to go into detail.
   ``There is an ongoing investigation into other allegedly
criminal activity,'' said Capt. Don Longfellow, a deputy public
affairs officer. To comment further could prejudice the inquiry, he
said.
   The several hundred Green Beret troops headquartered on Okinawa,
the southern Japanese island where some 30,000 U.S. troops are
based, often go on training exercises in friendly Asian countries
like Thailand, where the murder plot took place.
   The Stars And Stripes account of the trial said Gleason, of New
Orleans, offered James Bonard Fowler, an American in Thailand,
$50,000 to kill Dumpson. It said Gleason called off the plot when
he suspected it had been discovered and, and that he was arrested
in July. Fowler was not further identified.
   The army said Dumpson, whose hometown was unavailable, continued
on duty with his unit.
   Gleason was not given a punitive discharge, so he retained his
retirement benefits.

   Trinity News Co. has joined a number of other distributors,

   ``We want to make the immensely important statement to our young

   ``We checked with the supermarket and convenience store chains

   Ben Martin, president of Martin News Co. in Dallas County, said
his company sent noticed to constumers about the insert and asking

said they would, but left the final decision to store managers.

<HEAD>Frank Perdue Takes Soviet Ambassador on Poultry Tour</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS graf 3 to delete extraneous word</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ACCOMAC, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin met
poultry magnate Frank Perdue and walked away with two ``Oven
Stuffer Roasters'' and some insight into chicken processing.
   Dubinin on Monday took a daylong tour of Perdue Farms on the
Eastern Shore to get a firsthand look at the mechanics of poultry
processing.
   As chairman and chief owner of Perdue Farms, Dubinin's
68-year-old host oversees a chicken empire that's expected to gross
more than $1 billion in sales this year. Perdue's face is familiar
on television where he appears in his own commercials.
   ``It's something that's very well developed in the United States
and with Perdue especially,'' Dubinin said of American poultry
production. ``The problem in the Soviet Union is output quality and
quantity.''
   Perdue accompanied the ambassador and his entourage of eight
including Dubinin's wife, Liana, and two daughters through a
hatchery in Westover, and a processing plant in Accomac that
employs 1,700 people and slaughters an average 300,000 chickens a
day.
   Afterward, he presented the diplomat with an ice chest bearing
the Perdue logo that contained the two roasting chickens. The rest
of the Soviet delegation from Washington received similar freebies.
   Dubinin said the visit was his first contact with chicken
processing in any country. He called his trip a demonstration that
``diplomacy is not just politics, it's economic relations ...
technological relations.''
   The ambassador said the Soviet Union would like to increase
chicken production. Watching eviscerated poultry moving swiftly
through the production line, is ``an interesting experience for
me,'' he told reporters.
   As for Perdue's television commercials, Dubinin said he has seen
them and found them amusing. But he added that he is less concerned
with the marketing aspects of poultry production and more concerned
about output.
   Dubinin said there is potential for some joint enterprise with
Perdue and the Soviet Union, but ``we will have a better idea''
about that after Perdue makes a planned visit to the Soviet Union.
   Perdue spokeswoman Chris Whaley confirmed that Perdue is
scheduled to make a visit soon, but she declined to speculate on
what business dealings might be under discussion.

   Carla Southwell shed tears of joy
when she saw her 8-month-old son for the first time since she was
jailed almost seven weeks ago for hiding her two daughters from her
ex-husband.
   The tears of joy turned to tears of anguish moments later.
   ``He didn't even remember me,'' she said, sobbing.
   The 26-year-old Kent City woman alleges her ex-husband, William
Southwell, sexually abused the girls, ages 4 and 5, during
unsupervised visits.
   Southwell, 30, has denied the charges, saying the girls were
manipulated by their mother. An ongoing investigation has turned up
no evidence that he abused the girls.
   On Sept. 7, Ms. Southwell was jailed for contempt of court and
ordered held until the girls are surrendered.
   Her fiance, Kelly Erhart, and relatives are caring for the Ms.
Southwell's son, fathered by Erhart, who is not part of the court
order.
   In a telephone interview Monday from the Kent County Jail, Ms.
Southwell said she shares a cell with 10 to 20 other women,
including one facing a murder trial. She said she has had to fight
off one attack.
   ``I do a lot of writing letters, reading, praying,'' Ms.
Southwell said. ``And thinking.''
   In a videotape shown at a hearing last month, the couple's
daughters indicated they had been abused.
   Ms. Southwell said she has not been in contact with her
daughters, but is confident they are safe and healthy.
   ``I think about them constantly,'' she said, choking back tears.
``This is the worst thing that a loving mother could ever have to
go through.''
   Before making a decision on custody, Circuit Judge George Buth
said he wants the children to be evaluated by the county Department
of Protective Services. Otherwise, he said, he fears Ms. Southwell
may run away with the girls.
   ``The children are a battleground in this case,'' Buth said
Friday. ``They're the ones suffering.''
   Buth said he is concerned that Ms. Southwell made the
allegations against her ex-husband during a custody evaluation that
was in the father's favor.
   ``I can't say I've made up my mind whether sexual abuse has
occurred,'' said Southwell, also of Kent City. ``If Carla's so sure
I sexually abused them, why doesn't she give them up to protective
services like the judge ordered so professionals can make a
decision? I think my kids' lives need to be straightened out and
Carla's not doing that.''
   Ms. Southwell, who has had temporary custody of the children,
alleges the agency did a poor job in investigating her previous
allegations and she said they lack concern for the children.
   Southwell said custody was recommended for him because his
ex-wife denied him access to the children.
   ``This is the fifth time I've gone over two months without
seeing them because Carla wouldn't let me,'' he said.
   Though a physician testified at a custody hearing that one of
the girls had injuries typical of sexual abuse, an investigator
with the Sheriff's Department said there was no evidence to prove
Southwell was guilty.
   ``I believe that in her own heart and mind she believes this,
but we can't prove that it happened,'' Sgt. Ken Kleinheksel said.
``All we got was a very confused statement from a child.''
   Ms. Southwell said she will stay behind bars until she is
assured her ex-husband will not have contact with their daughters.
   ``It's very difficult to accept the fact that I can't see my
daughters, but I'll hang on and I'll fight to the last day,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
   Maria DeSillers must pay a $235,000 hospital bill
for her late son's three unsuccessful liver transplants, a judge
has ordered.
   Dade Circuit Judge Francis Christie approved a proposed
settlement Monday over the objections of Ms. Desillers, who was
ejected from the hearing after an outburst.
   The settlement, which was reached by the Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh and Karen Gievers, the court-appointed curator of Ronnie
DeSiller's estate, represented a 10 percent discount on its
original charge of $261,000.
   Ms. DeSillers was thrown out of the courtroom in the second
phase of the hearing, which dealt with a $31,000 bill from the
state.
   The state said it would drop the bill if the balance of the
estate were turned over to the Governor's Transplant Lifeline for
Children, set up to help children in Ronnie's circumstances. The
judge approved the arrangement.
   During state testimony about the TLC program, Ms. DeSillers
slammed her hand down on a notebook and complained that TLC turned
her down when she asked for help for Ronnie.
   ``No more outbursts,'' Christie warned. ``Do you understand me?''
   ``No sir, I don't,'' she said, ``because they did not help me
with my child.''
   ``Get her out of here,'' the judge ordered the bailiff.
   Ms. DeSillers contended that the hospital did not treat the boy
correctly. Her attorney, Frank Johnson, questioned price
discrepancies between allegedly similar items on the 1,700-page
bill.
   The payment will leave Ronnie's estate with $25,000 to $30,000.
Donations of more than $670,000 poured in from around the country
while the 7-year-old endured the futile operations.
   Ms. DeSillers, who paid $162,000 on the original bill of
$424,000, balked on paying the balance last year and sued the
hospital.
   Johnson said Ms. DeSillers' criminal attorney, Roy Black, who
represents her in a pending investigation by the local state
attorney's office, had advised her not to reveal information to the
curator because it would compromise Ms. DeSiller's guarantees
against self-incrimination.
   Edwin K. Zechman Jr., president of Children's Hospital, said the
recommendations of the curator and the judge's decision ``fully
vindicate our position.''
   After the hospital is paid, $25,000 to $30,000 will remain in
the bank account that was set up for contributions on behalf of
children in need of transplant surgery.

   Hours after his team drubbed Dartmouth,
Cornell University cornerback Evan Parke met yet another muscular,
6-foot opponent last weekend, this one in his shower.
   A Bahamian boa constrictor gave Parke, 20, a rude homecoming
when he returned home early Sunday morning, a day after Cornell
beat Dartmouth 24-7.
   Parke said he had just stepped into the shower he saw the snake
curled around the shower head.
   ``I didn't need to look twice,'' he said. ``The snake freaked me
out. I jumped back and picked up my towel. I left the water on. I
didn't want to look at it.''
   Gordon Gabaree, a private wildlife control specialist, extracted
the boa from the shower. The snake is believed to belong to a
former tenant who reported a snake missing two months ago.

   A 21-year-old surfer says he was
attacked by a great white shark but was able to pull his leg out of
the attacker's mouth.
   Wyndham Kapan of Cannon Beach received 21 stitches in his right
knee following the Sunday afternoon attack, said his mother, Jan
Kapan.
   ``He's very lucky he didn't lose the leg,'' his mother said
Monday.
   Great white sharks usually are seen off the coast between August
and December, said Bruce Mate, a marine mammologist with the
Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport. The animals are drawn to
areas with a large numbers of seals and sea lions.
   Surfers are especially vulnerable because a surfboard can look
like a seal to a shark swimming underwater, Mate said.

<HEAD>Yerkes Establishes Sperm Bank For Chimpanzees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first sperm bank for chimpanzees is
designed to meet the increasing demand for animals by AIDS
researchers, the bank's founder says.
   Chimpanzees are highly valued in research because they are the
closest biologically to humans. But they are a threatened species
that can no longer be captured legally in the wild.
   Dr. Kenneth G. Gould, chief of reproductive biology at the
Yerkes Regional Primate Center, said researchers there and at other
centers around the world infect the animals with AIDS to study the
progress of the disease in an animal with an immune system similar
to man's.
   Unlike man, the animals do not die of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, but they can spread the virus and therefore are not
allowed to breed after being infected.
   ``I'm glad to hear about his success,'' said Dr. Duane C.
Kraemer, a specialist in primate reproduction and a Texas A&M
University professor. ``It's important that we develop techniques
for sperm storage and artificial insemination for a number of
species.''
   The bank will help breeders maintain a genetically diverse
population of captive chimps and give scientists a model for
developing sperm banks for other primates such as gorillas.
   For more than three decades, scientists have frozen human and
cattle sperm successfully, but the same formulas did not prevent
ice crystals from destroying the chimpanzee sperm until Gould's
success.
   Gould began freezing the chimpanzee sperm in 1986, and
eventually found that it had to be frozen more slowly than that of
other species.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Wound At Least Six Palestinians</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with army retracting report that 7-year-old died,
other details on violence. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops shot and wounded at least six
Palestinians today in clashes throughout the occupied territories,
Arab hospital officials said.
   The violence occurred a day after soldiers shot and killed a
17-year-old Palestinian in the occupied West Bank. The death
brought the number of Palestinians killed in the 10-month-old
Palestinian uprising to 302. Six Israelis also have died.
   The army, meanwhile, today retracted a report that a 7-year-old
Arab boy died after being shot in the chest with a plastic bullet
during a nighttime clash in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Two military spokesmen in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem called The
Associated Press to say their earlier report was erroneous and that
the boy was in stable condition at Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel
Aviv. No explanation was given for the error.
   The boy, Ali Hussein Abu Amra, was hit in the chest by a plastic
bullet after troops fired at stone-throwing protesters in the
Shabura neighborhood of Rafah on Monday night, an official at
Nasser Hospital said.
   Abu Amra was taken intially to Nasser Hospital and later
transferred to Tel Hashomer. A hospital spokesman, Dr. Moshe
Tirosh, said the boy was in intensive care with a bullet wound to
the chest.
   Soldiers today imposed a curfew on the neighborhood where Abu
Amra was shot and troops fired tear gas at high school students who
stoned soldiers elsewhere in Rafah, but there were no injuries,
Arab news reports said.
   Arab reports and witnesses said nine people were wounded today _
two of them seriously _ in confrontations in six cities and refugee
camps in the occupied territories.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   A 22-year-old man suffered a serious plastic gunshot wound in
the neck when soldiers raided the village of Tamoun near the city
of Nablus, Arab news reports said. He was taken to Rafidiyeh
Hospital in Nablus, the reports said.
   At Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, Mohammed Ali Rweideh, 26, of
Nozeirat refugee camp in Gaza was reported in critical condition
with a bullet wound to the chest.
   Two teen-agers, aged 14 and 15, were struck by plastic bullets
during stoning protests in the Gaza town of Khan Yunis and Deir el
Balah refugee camp, hospital officials said.
   Soldiers later clamped a curfew on parts of Khan Yunis in
response to the protests and detained about a dozen Palestinians,
according to Arab news reports.
   Elsewhere in Gaza, an Israeli oil tanker driver opened fire in a
marketplace after the tire of his truck was hit by a firebomb, Arab
witnesses said. Three Palestinian men were hospitalized with
gunshot wounds, a hospital official said.
   Arab reports said soldiers at scene also opened fire. It was
unclear who fired the bullets that struck the Palestinians.
   Witnesses said a donkey was fatally shot and a horse was wounded
in the incident.
   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, a 15-year-old boy was hit in
the abdomen by a bullet after troops opened fire on Arab
stone-throwers, a local hospital official said.
   Soldiers also shot and wounded a 35-year-old man in the left leg
during a clash with stone-throwers in Nablus, an official at Al
Ittihad Hospital said.

<TEXT>
   The Likud and Labor parties clashed over a U.S.
television appearance by King Hussein of Jordan in which the
monarch said he was ready to head a Jordanian-Palestinian
delegation in peace talks with Israel.
   In television commercials Monday, the left-wing Labor Party
claimed Hussein proved the credibility of its peace platform by
announcing he was ready to take an active part in talks with Israel.
   The right-wing Likud Bloc accused Labor of being ready to hand
all the territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war to
Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Arafat on Sunday urged Arab Israelis to participate in the Nov.
1 election and said Jewish voters should cast ballots for peace.
   By participating in the elections, Arabs can assure themselves
of 14-15 seats in Israel's parliament and influence the government,
Arafat was quoted as telling Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
   Arafat also said Palestinians in the occupied territories would
not take up arms to continue the 10-month uprising against Israeli
rule. More than 300 Palestinians and six Israelis have died in the
uprising, which is a key Israeli election issue.
   In a hard-hitting ad with grim music, the Likud showed a
portrait of Arafat on Labor's ballot slip, indicating a vote for
Labor was a vote for the PLO.
   The Likud also charged Labor with orchestrating Hussein's
television appearance and said it was a cheap ploy to win votes.
   Both parties showed clips of Hussein's interview, which was
broadcast Thursday on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   Labor has campaigned on a peace platform based on direct
negotations with a joint delegation of Jordan and Palestinians who
do not belong to the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist
organization. The talks would be held under the aegis of an
international peace conference.
   The campaign appeared to lose credibility after Hussein
announced last summer he was giving up all claims to the occupied
territories and acknowledged the PLO's responsibility for them.
   In one segment of the interview, Hussein praised Labor Party
leader and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. A party spokeswoman said
the interview disproved Likud claims that Labor's peace proposal
was unrealistic.
   In one commercial, Labor screened film clips of Sunday's
television debate between Peres and Likud leader and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir to support its claim the Likud is intransigent about
peace.
   Labor showed one clip in which Shamir distinguished between the
Sinai desert, which Israel gave back to Egypt in return for peace,
and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which, he said, were an
integral part of the biblical land of Israel.
   The Likud rejects the proposal for an international peace
conference and opposes yielding any part of the occupied
territories.

   Jurors who acquitted a Navajo man in the
burning deaths of two tribal police officers in December said the
verdict was due to a lack of concrete evidence and witnesses'
changed stories.
   After deliberating five hours, the 12-member jury acquitted Ben
Atene Jr. of all counts Monday following his second trial in the
deaths of officers Roy Lee Stanley and Andy Begay.
   While family members met the verdict with shouts and tears,
Atene, 24, remained somber.
   ``All I can say is my cousin, brother and half brother are
innocent too,'' he said.
   His cousin Thomas Cly, 22, and half-brother Vinton Bedoni, 31,
were convicted of first-degree murder in August and sentenced to
life in prison. The same jury, after deliberating for more than 46
hours, could not agree on a verdict for Atene and U.S. District
Judge J. Thomas Greene declared a mistrial.
   Charges against Atene's brother, Marques Atene, 22, were dropped
when prosecutors acknowledged they did not have enough evidence to
gain a conviction.
   Two jurors said the lack of concrete evidence led to their
verdict.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Schwendiman said he was relieved
that the case was over.
   ``It was a messy and ugly thing to have to live with for a
year,'' he said. ``I just hope this verdict helps to heal the
wounds. People need to get on with their lives.''
   Following a murder and trial that has sharply divided the
residents of Monument Valley, Atene said he was not sure whether he
would be able to go home again.
   ``I lost all my job, I lost all my brand new pickup. That's all
I can say,'' Atene said.
   Atene's father said earlier that the family's truck was
repossessed when his son was no longer around to help make the
payments.
   In final arguments, prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed
that the verdict hinged on whether jurors believed five prosecution
witnesses who testified they saw Ben Atene at the Dec. 4, 1987,
desert bonfire drinking party where the officers were shot.
   All five witnesses originally denied being at the party, but two
decided to testify for the prosecution after they were charged with
perjury.
   Prosecutors contended that Atene was at the drinking party and
later was seen at the remote Copper Canyon site where the officers
and their vehicles were doused with gasoline and set afire.
   Atene and members of his family said he went to bed early that
night and arose before dawn to take part in a traditional Navajo
healing ceremony.
   Several defense witnesses testified that three of the
prosecution witnesses were elsewhere on the night of the bonfire.
   Prosecutors argued that Atene did not pull the trigger but his
involvement throughout the incident made him equally guilty.

   The government today demanded an immediate
meeting with Lech Walesa to prepare the way for the convening
Friday of talks with the opposition on Poland's future.
   Walesa rejected the demand, leaving prospects for the start to
the round-table talks in doubt.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said Walesa and Interior
Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak must meet Wednesday to clear away
disputes on who can participate in the talks.
   The government objects to two names proposed by Solidarity and
wants clarification on whether the individuals will respect
Poland's constitutional order, he said.
   The talks cannot begin without such a preparatory meeting, Urban
told reporters at his weekly news conference.
   Walesa later reiterated that he would reject any governent
interference in the composition of Solidarity's delegation to the
talks. He said he does not want another preparatory meeting with
Kiszczak. The two men have met three times since Aug. 31.
   ``I will not allow any personnel changes. It could be a
precedent, a dangerous precedent for the future,'' Walesa said.
   He said church mediator Andrzej Stelmachowski was fully
empowered to negotiate any other procedural or technical matters on
his behalf.
   Walesa, who spoke by telephone from his home in Gdansk, said he
still hoped for discussions that would bring about ``understanding
and the implementation of pluralism,'' and said the proposed date
of Friday was acceptable to him for the talks to begin.
   Urban charged that Solidarity's ``stubbornness'' was preventing
the talks from beginning.
   Urban's remarks today were the first time the government has
announced a proposed date for the round-table talks.
   Kiszczak and Walesa agreed to such talks Aug. 31 while strikes
continued around Poland in the country's worst labor unrest in
seven years.
   After begin guaranteed the talks could include the subject of
Solidarity's future, as well as broader questions of economic and
political pluralism in the communist country, Walesa ended the
strikes.
   The opposition demands the talks lead to legalization of
Solidarity, banned in 1982 after the December 1981 martial law
crackdown.
   Solidarity had been the first recognized independent labor
federation in the Soviet bloc.
   On Friday, Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said the
government opposes legalizing Solidarity until the economy improves
and Poland changes its political system to allow more political
demands outside of trade unions.

<TEXT>
   A British television documentary claims U.S.
organized crime was behind the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, and that his shooting was carried out by three French
gangsters.
   The two-hour Central Television program entitled ``The Men Who
Killed Kennedy'' says the assassins were from Marseilles. The
documentary is to be broadcast tonight. Details of the program were
made available today.
   The documentary names one of the alleged killers as Lucien Sarti
and says he was shot to death in Mexico in 1972. It a second
alleged killer is believed to be working in Colombia's cocaine
trade and the third is understood to be living in Marseilles after
his recent release from prison.
   Central Television, a company in Britain's commercial
Independent Television network, said the program was based on a
four-year inquiry by American writer and researcher Steve Rivele
and the program's British director, Nigel Turner.
   Kennedy was killed as he rode in a motorcade through Dallas on
Nov. 22, 1963. American Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the
shooting but was shot dead two days later in a police station by
Jack Ruby. The Warren Commission found Oswald acted alone in
killing Kennedy.
   There have been numerous theories over the years alleging Oswald
was not the killer or that he was part of a conspiracy. Numerous
organizations, countries and personalities have been alleged to
have been involved in Kennedy's death.
   The program says Kennedy and his brother Robert, then the U.S.
attorney-general, were cracking down on organized crime at the time
of the assassination.
   Turner said: ``At last we can show that all those Americans who,
for 25 years, believed in Oswald's innocence and in a greater
conspiracy were correct.''
   Rivele claims in the program that the three Frenchmen alleged to
have killed Kennedy were hired through organized crime circles in
the French Mediterranean island of Corsica.
   A purported drug smuggler who claims he was offered the
underworld contract to assassinate Kennedy but did not accept it,
and a former drug trafficker who reportedly became a government
informant appear on the program to support Rivele's allegations.
   The documentary claims the U.S. and French governments have
sufficient evidence to act against the two surviving Frenchmen.

   A delay in the production of flu vaccine
will keep people from receiving influenza shots until the end of
the peak time for protecting patients.
   But as the season approaches, Medicare subscribers in 10 areas
of the country were told the will receive free flu shots for the
first time as part of a $100 million program aimed at saving the
lives of thousands of people killed by influenza each year.
   The drug companies who make the vaccine say the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control took longer than normal to identify the strains
needed in the vaccines, in part causing a two-month delay in
delivering the drugs to doctors.
   But the CDC contends the notification wasn't late. Both sides
agree the viruses causing this season's flu take longer to
cultivate for vaccines.
   Shipment of vaccines will not be finished until late November _
the end of the peak period for protection, officials said. October
and November are considered the best times for immunization.
   Suzanne Gaventa, a CDC epidemiologist, denied the federal agency
was late in notifying the drug companies. She said the strains were
identified in conjunction with the World Health Organization and
published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report April
22.
   She said the decision is routinely made in March or April.
   Ms. Gaventa attributed the delay to an especially low production
yield by two of the three strains covered by the vaccine.
   The largest producer of the vaccines, Wyeth Laboratories Inc.,
of suburban St. Davids, usually has shipped most of its 9 million
doses by September. This year, Wyeth will send vaccines to
physicians through early to mid-November, said company spokeswoman
Audrey Ashby.
   As of Monday, Wyeth had sent 90 percent of its shipments.
   Ms. Ashby said that although the word from the CDC was later
than usual, the primary cause of the delay for Wyeth was a decrease
in yield by as much as 70 percent for one of the three strains.
   Marshall Molloy, spokesman for Parke-Davis in Morris Plains,
N.J., said Parke-Davis has sent about half its lot of 8 million
doses and plans on completing shipments in mid- to late November.
   Janet Skidmore, spokeswoman for E.R. Squibb & Sons, which
distributes flu vaccines manufactured by the third vaccine
producer, Connaught, said their shipments of about 6 million doses
should be complete by early November.
   At a medical meeting in Los Angeles, meanwhile, Dr. Walter
Orenstein, who directs the CDC's immunization division, said the
Medicare-funded flu-shot demonstration project that started last
week was ordered by Congress and will cost up to $25 million
annually for four years.
   It is meant to determine if the government can save money by
paying for flu shots _ rather than the cost of treating disease _
for the elderly and others most at risk of death from the flu, he
said Monday.
   The highest risk group for the flu, and traditionally last on
the list of those immunized, are older people living in close
quarters in big-city nursing homes, said Paul Stehr-Green, a CDC
immunologist.
   Doctors prefer to immunize them last because their systems do
not hold on to the antibody as long as younger people's, he said.
   ``If they don't get it in time, there's a risk of an influenza
epidemic'' among older people, he said.
   The vaccine is suggested annually for people 65 and older and
for those with heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, sickle
cell anemia and those whose spleens have been removed.
   Three of the locations will be announced in a few weeks when
negotiations are completed. Orenstein listed the seven others as
health agencies for the states of North Carolina, Ohio and
Oklahoma; the University of Rochester, which will operate a program
in Monroe County, N.Y.; and health departments in San Antonio,
Texas; Allegheny County, Pa., including Pittsburgh; and Maricopa
County, Ariz., including Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   Residents in this upscale suburb 12 miles
southwest of Boston say three months with the new 508 telephone
area code is three months too long.
   The town's cry to revert back to the greater Boston area code of
617 was being heard today by the Legislature's government
regulations committee, which has received more than 100 letters
from residents upset about the change.
   A bill that would force the change back was filed this summer by
Rep. Ellen Canavan of Needham when the state Department of Public
Utilities rejected the town's request.
   ``It's one of the daily, constant little things that drive you
crazy,'' said Canavan, who lives in neighboring Needham, which
retained its 617 code.
   Dover is one of 193 communities given the new 508 area code by
the New England Telephone Co. in an effort to avoid running out of
telephone numbers in eastern Massachusetts.
   The 508 zone includes Boston's far western suburbs, much of
central Massachusetts, Cape Cod and the islands, southeastern
Massachusetts, Cape Ann and the Merrimack Valley.
   Dover residents say they are oriented toward Boston and not
central Massachusetts. But they acknowledge the town's affluence
makes it liable to charges of seeking special consideration.
   Telephone company officials say the designations were carefully
made, and they fear if Dover's effort is successful, other
municipalities will rebel.
   ``Unfortunately, it's a very emotional issue,'' said Jacqueline
Jung, a New England Telephone spokeswoman.
   ``But for some very real business reasons we had to draw the
line somewhere. It was a long thoughtful process. Dover is no
different from any other community. It just thinks it's different.''

   Emperor Hirohito received an emergency blood
transfusion today to counter intestinal bleeding, the Imperial
Household Agency said.
   Physicians gave the 87-year-old monarch more than a pint of
blood, bringing the total he has received since becoming ill Sept.
19 to about 26 pints _ more than three times his normal circulation.
   Hirohito's blood pressure _ which had fallen to below 100
systolic before the transfusion _ went up to 118 over 58 and his
pulse was 108 beats a minutes this afternoon, palace spokesman
Kenji Maeda said. A normal blood pressure reading is about 120 over
80.
   The emperor also was running a fever.
   The world's longest-reigning monarch was in stable condition and
was sleeping well late this afternoon, Maeda said.
   Earlier today, doctors said Hirohito's anemia was improving.
   They believe the bleeding originates from Hirohito's intestine,
which underwent surgery in September 1987 to bypass a blockage
caused by an inflamed pancreas.

   A car bomb exploded today in the
Syrian-policed town of Barr Elias in the Bekaa Valley, injuring at
least five people, police said.
   A police spokesman reached by telephone in Zahle, provincial
capital of the Bekaa, said the car blew up at 1:10 p.m. outside a
grocery store on the Beirut-Damascus highway.
   ``Rescuers evacuated at least five wounded civilians from the
scene,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
police regulations.
   In Beirut, the Voice of the Nation radio station said Syrian
troops cordoned off Barr Elias after the explosion, the 16th car
bombing in Lebanon this year.
   Ambulances and fire engines were sent from Zahle to Barr Elias,
28 miles southeast of Beirut. The town has a predominantly Sunni
Moslem population of 30,000.
   Like most of the Bekaa region, Barr Elias is controlled by
Syrian troops. Syrian maintains an estimated 40,000 soldiers in the
eastern and northern provinces as well as Moslem west Beirut.
   The force is supported by Lebanon's Moslems and leftists, and
violently opposed by right-wing Christians who regard the Syrians
an occupying power.
   By police count, 104 people were killed and 378 wounded in 15
previous car bombings in Lebanon since April 23.

   A ship sank with more than 500 people
aboard during the height of Typhoon Ruby, and the coast guard said
today only 15 survivors were rescued before the search was
suspended for the night.
   The storm, which officials said killed at least 76 people on
land and left 111,000 homeless, tore through the central
Philippines and into the South China Sea today.
   Coast guard officials said the 2,845-ton Dona Marilyn sank
Monday in the Visayas Sea, about 300 miles southeast of Manila. It
was not clear how many people were lost.
   Lt. Rey Esguerra of the coast guard station in Cebu said
rescuers found 11 survivors on Maripipi Island and another small
island and that four people were found floating in the water.
   Esguerra later said the search was suspended because of darkness
and bad weather, but would resume at dawn Wednesday.
   The Dona Marilyn was carrying 451 passengers and 60 crew members
from Manila to Tacloban on Leyte Island when it radioed a distress
call, said Carlos Go, general manager of Sulpicio Lines, owner of
the vessel.
   Others missing and feared dead from Typhoon Ruby included 25 in
the Mindanao Island coastal city of Cagayan de Oro, 15 in
Mindanao's Zamboanga del Sur province and about 70 aboard a bus
that plunged into a swollen river Monday.
   Ruby lashed the main Philippine island, Luzon, with torrential
rains and wind gusts of up 140 mph.
   The storm caused widespread flooding on the island, triggering
landslides and washing away bridges. Agriculture Secretary Carlos
Dominguez said preliminary estimates showed Ruby caused $45.7
million in crop damage.
   President Corazon Aquino's spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, said the
six-province Bicol region of southeastern Luzon was without
electricity today.
   The weather service said Ruby's center passed about 50 miles
east of Manila and swept into the provinces of Tarlac, Bulacan and
Nueva Ecija, the Philippines' rice-producing heartland.
   Government meteorologists said more than nine inches of rain
fell at the Manila's airport in 24 hours.
   Casualty and damage reports were incomplete because of poor
communications. Figures compiled from the Red Cross and various
government agencies showed 26 dead in Antique province, 15 in
Zamboanga del Sur province, 11 in Cagayan de Oro, 11 in Marikina,
six on Camiguin island, three in Nueva Ecija, two in Surigao City,
and one each in Pampanga province and Bulacan.
   In Zamboanga, two Philippine navy ships _ a landing ship and a
hospital vessel _ sank Monday after being battered by heavy waves.
There were no casualties.
   Power outages and widespread flooding hit Manila early today as
Ruby approached. Schools, government offices, Manila's two stock
exchanges and many private businesses were closed as strong winds
buffeted the capital.
   Most domestic flights from Manila's airport were canceled again
today, but airport officials said international service was normal.
   The Department of Social Welfare said at least 110,000 of the
nation's 23 million people were left homeless by the storm.
   Schools were closed at the American bases and the U.S. military
television station said only essential personnel were on duty.
   Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark Air Base, 50 miles north
of Manila, reported no major structural damage, but said some
aircraft were evacuated to an undisclosed ``safe location.''
   Ruby was the 18th typhoon or tropical storm to hit the
Philippines this year and was the strongest typhoon to hit Luzon
since Patsy, which killed at least 175 people in 1970.
   Rodrigo Roldan, civil defense director on Panay Island, said
Monday at least five people were killed when a bus careened off a
bridge during heavy winds and rain, and plunged into a river.
   But today, Roldan said 18 people had been rescued but no bodies
found. He said the bus may have carried up to 90 passengers, most
of whom were either trapped inside or were swept away by flood
waters.

   Discovery's five astronauts today
thanked the workers here who launched them into space last month on
the first post-Challenger space shuttle flight.
   ``If there's a heartbeat of America's space program, it's here
at the Kennedy Space Center; we thank you for helping us pull off
this successful mission,'' Discovery pilot Richard O. Covey told a
crowd of several thousand.
   ``What made our vehicle lift off the launch pad was not the
solid fuel booster rockets or the main engines,'' said mission
specialist George D. Nelson. ``What was pushing us was all your
good feelings and the work you put into it.''
   Commander Frederick H. Hauck presented the workers with an
autograph book which he and his crew carried into orbit. It bears
the signatures of more than 15,000 technicians, engineers,
managers, clerical and other sdpace center personnel who signed it
before the launch.
   In accepting the book, center director Forrest S. McCartney said
it would ``become a part of the Kennedy Space Center's history.''
   Hauck also presented McCartney with a picture montage of three
shuttle launchings that included a photograph of the seven
Challenger astronauts kiilled when that shuttle exploded on Jan.
28, 1986.
   Hauck, Covey, Nelson and the other crew members, John M. Lounge
and David C. Hilmers, were honored Monday by thousands of people
who lined the motorcade route in nearby Cocoa Beach, where many of
the space workers live.
   Along the route, which they traveled in convertibles, the
astronauts were greeted by high school bands, congratulatory signs,
American flags and applause.
   The ceremonies continue a busy schedule for the space travelers
since their four-day flight. They have been honored by President
Reagan at the White House, visited Congress and were hailed at
celebrations at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   Meanwhile, workers here were joining the space shuttle Atlantis
to its two solid fuel boster rockets and external fuel tank,
preparing it for a launch in late November with a classified
Defense Department satellite. Atlantis is scheduled to be
transported to the launch pad next weekend.

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Single-Family Homes Fell 2.2 Percent in
September</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing single-family homes fell 2.2
percent in September after an unexpectedly strong sales spurt
earlier this year, a real estate trade group said today.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
homes declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million
units last month, following a 2.2 percent increase in August and a
5.0 percent decline in July.
   Sales had increased every month from February through June,
suprising economists who had predicted that gradually rising
interest rates would dampen home buying. However, as it turned out,
many buyers apparently bought early in an attempt to beat rising
rates.
   ``The decline ... in September is a hangover from the buying
spree of the summer,'' said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist of
the real estate group. ``The extraordinary increase'' of the summer
was ``in part borrowed from September.''
   Fixed-rate mortgages hit a low of 9.84 percent in February and
rose to 10.71 percent by early August. Since then, they've eased
back to 10.28 percent.
   Tuccillo predicted sales rates will continue to lag in the
fourth quarter and by year-end would total 3.47 million units, down
only slightly from 3.53 million in 1987.
   The median price of a home fell from August to September by
$2,900 to $88,500, meaning half sold for more and half for less.
The decline was a normal seasonal development as the summer
home-selling season drew to a close, Tuccillo said.
   The Northeast remained the costliest region of the country, with
a median sales price of $141,400, up 6.3 percent from a year ago.
In the West, the median price was $124,300, up 7.1 percent from a
year earlier. The median in the South was $82,400, up 3.6 percent
from September 1987. In the Midwest, the price was $67,100, up 1.5
percent. The national appreciation rate over 12 months was 3.5
percent.
   The West was the only region of the country showing an increase
of sales last month. They rose 6.0 percent to 710,000 units,
following a 3.1 percent increase in August.
   Sales fell 5.8 percent in the Northeast to 650,000 units, the
lowest level since January. They fell 3.2 percent in the Midwest to
900,000 units and were off 2.8 percent in the South to 1.38 million
units.
   Tuccillo said the sales market is particularly vigorous in
California. Analysts have attributed the increased activity to fear
that local government will impose development controls on building
new homes.

   Rep. Pat Swindall today offered to give up his
right to a jury trial on federal perjury charges in order to obtain
a verdict by Election Day, but U.S. District Judge Robert Vining
immediately rejected the idea.
   With jury selection entering its third day, Swindall told
Vining, ``I'm just real concerned as to whether or not we can get
this case tried this week and next week.''
   Swindall added, ``I am prepared to waive my right to be tried by
a jury. It's not something I want to do.''
   Vining would determine a verdict in a non-jury trial, but he
said he would not do so in Swindall's case. He pledged to try to
expedite the trial while safeguarding the congressman's rights.
   ``Mr. Swindall, I understand the importance of the events of
Nov. 8 to you,'' Vining said. ``However, I do think there are
things more important to you than the election of Nov. 8.''
   Swindall, who contends the perjury charges against him are based
on lapses in his memory, cited President Reagan's claims of faulty
memory in the Iran-contra affair as he questioned prospective
jurors Monday.
   Acting as his own attorney, Swindall asked four of 18
prospective jurors about Reagan's claim that he could not remember
the extent of his knowledge regarding the sale of arms to Iran and
diversion of some proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels.
   Two of the prospective jurors seemed sympathetic to Reagan's
claim. Two others indicated they were skeptical.
   Twenty more people were to be questioned today by Swindall,
prosecutor Craig Gillen and Judge Robert Vining. Selection of the
12-member jury was expected to be completed today.
   On Monday, Vining granted Swindall's motion to excuse one
potential juror who said he would lean toward the prosecution.
   Swindall, 38-year-old two-term Republican, said he remained
confident the trial can be completed before the Nov. 8 election, in
which he faces Democrat Ben Jones.
   After Swindall's Oct. 17 indictment on 10 counts, he demanded a
quick start for his trial because of the election.
   He is accused of lying to a grand jury, primarily about a
meeting he held last year with an undercover Internal Revenue
Service agent posing as a money broker.
   The prosecution, which has a tape recording of the meeting, says
Swindall knew the agent was suggesting that illegal drug proceeds
would be used to back an $850,000 mortgage for Swindall's house.
   The loan was never executed, although Swindall did briefly
accept a $150,000 check from another man involved in the
negotiations.
   Swindall has said he was tripped up by a ``memory contest'' and
never intended to deceive the grand jury.
   Vining ruled that Swindall may put himself on the witness stand
without using another attorney to question him.
   Gillen objected, arguing that Swindall would be able to deliver
a monologue without giving the government a chance to object to
improper questions. But Vining said he did not want to interfere
with Swindall's right to represent himself.
   Although recent polls show Jones with a 2-1 lead, Swindall said
he remained confident he can defeat Jones ``as soon as that
acquittal happens.'' He said the end of the trial would allow him
to contrast his conservative record with what he described as
Jones' liberal stands.

   A 12-year-old boy fleeing from police lost
control of a stolen car, killing a man and an 11-year-old girl and
critically injuring her sister.
   Homicide charges are being considered against the driver and two
passengers, ages 13 and 14, police said today. The three boys have
been charged charged with aggravated assault, auto theft, reckless
endangerment and conspiracy. The cases are being handled through
the juvenile justice system, but the district attorney is reviewing
the charges, police said.
   The girls were struck Monday afternoon about a block from their
home. Police said the stolen vehicle crashed into another car,
which swerved into the girls.
   Also killed was William O'Conner, 53, a real estate agent who
was the father of nine children. O'Conner was driving the car that
was struck by the stolen vehicle.
   Tyesha Tate, 11, was killed and her sister Robin, was in
critical condition this morning, according to a spokeswoman at
Albert Einstein Medical Center. The hospital would not release
Robin's age.
   The 12-year-old driver ran from the scene but showed up at
Einstein shortly afterward with minor injuries and was taken into
custody, police said. The two other boys were caught by police
after they tried to run from the scene.

   Republican front-runner George Bush today
accused Democratic rival Michael Dukakis of trying to divide
Americans along economic lines and exploit ``the base temptations
of division, fear and envy.''
   Toughening his attack with the election two weeks away, Bush
also scorned Dukakis' economic policies, charging that ``he clings,
despite all the evidence of the last two decades, to the
discredited policies of high taxes and government spending.''
   Bush addressed the Ohio Association of Broadcasters as a GOP
team in Washington was assigned to deal with Democratic charges of
lies, distortions and racial bigotry in the vice president's
campaign advertising.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu and
former Sen. John Tower of Texas were detailed to rebut the charges
at an afternoon news conference.
   Speaking with reporters on his Air Force Two campaign plane,
Bush referred to the racism charge in connection with a
soft-on-crime TV ad used against the Massachusetts governor.
   ``One of the charges was so vicious and so ugly and so unfounded
that I think our people feel they had to respond,'' Bush said.
   In Ohio, the vice president was campaigning in Columbus, Canton
and Lima, hoping to bolster his lead in the polls and deny Dukakis
one of the states on his must-win list for the Nov. 8 election.
   Bush told the broadasters, ``I've been disturbed as I've
witnessed my opponent's campaign over the several past weeks at the
increasing appeals to class conflict. In my view, there is no place
in American public life for philosophies that divide Americans one
from another along class lines, and that excite conflict among
them.''
   Stressing the need for national unity, Bush said, ``America will
find her future by keeping with the traditions of her past _
traditions of openness, generosity and cooperation. We will move
forward not by succumbing to the base temptations of division, fear
and envy but by following, as Abraham Lincoln said, those better
angels of our nature.''
   Bush said that under President Reagan, the unemployment rate had
dropped from 12.5 percent during the 1981-82 recession to a current
5.9 percent. (Actually, the all-time high jobless rate was 10.8
percent in November and December of 1982. The current rate is 5.4
percent for September.)
   Bush promised that if elected, he will elevate the White House
science adviser to assistant to the president and ``make him an
active member of the economic policy council and our national
security planning processes.''
   Moreover, Bush said, he would create a president's council of
science and technology advisers composed of leading scientists,
engineers and corporate executives.
   With 23 electoral votes, Ohio is one of the key battlegrounds in
the presidential race. Two recent newspaper polls both gave Bush an
11-point edge over Dukakis in that state. Today marked the vice
president's sixth visit to Ohio since the GOP National Convention.
   He accused Dukakis of advocating an industrial policy ``which
means having bureaucrats back in Washington, D.C., pick the winners
and the losers and that would simply make us all losers.''
   Bush also chided Dukakis for opposing a reduction in the capital
gains tax, saying that everytime it has been cut in the past it has
brought in more revenue than it has lost.
   Campaigning Monday in New England, Bush stressed pocketbook
issues and tried to spark a heavy voter turnout for the Republicans.
   ``Things look pretty good nationally. Things look pretty good
but the race is going strong,'' Bush told an audience that waited
in the rain to see him at a firehouse rally in Williston, Vt. By
the time Bush arrived, the skies had cleared and crowds lined the
street, with a sprinkling of protesters.
   ``The undecided voters are goingto make a big difference,'' he
said. ``Please don't let up. Don't take anything for granted. Get
that vote out.''
   Bush usually does not respond to charges from Dukakis, but he
made an exception to reply to complaints about GOP campaign
commercials.
   ``These guys can dish it out but they can't take it ...,'' Bush
said. ``He wants to run away from his record and I am not going to
let him do that.''
   ``He cannot take it,'' the vice presdent said of Dukakis. ``He
cannot take it and now he's trying to turn and make the issue what
we are saying.''
   He said his campaign has ``complete documentation'' for its
advertisements assailing Dukakis over a Massachusetts prisoner
furlough program _ which now has been curtailed _ and on defense
issues. Dukakis is broadcasting commercials accusing the Bush
campaign of lying.
   ``And he is upset, not because it's false, but because he is
weak on crime and defense, and that's the inescapable truth,'' Bush
said.
   Bush also denied as ``absolutely ridiculous'' Democratic charges
that there is racism in his advertising on the prison furlough
program, with its focus on black prisoner Willie Horton who raped a
white woman and attacked her fiance. ``I stand fully behind these
ads,'' Bush said.
   Bush brushed aside questions about Dukakis' charge that Bush
would personally reap a $22,000-a-year tax break from his proposal
to cut the capital gains tax.

   Republican George Bush accused Democratic rival Michael Dukakis
today of making ``appeals to class conflict'' in charging that a
Bush administration would be slanted toward the rich _ including
the vice president himself.
   Dukakis, who was campaigning today in California, said Monday
that Bush's proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax would
benefit the well-to-do and would have meant tax savings to Bush
personally of about $22,000 a year if it had been in effect the
past three years.
   Bush said today, ``I've been disturbed, as I've witnessed my
opponent's campaign of the last several weeks, at the increasing
appeals to class conflict. In my view, there is no place in
American public life for philosophies that divide Americans one
from another, and that excite conflict among them.''
   ``America will find her future by keeping with the traditions of
her past, traditions of openness, generosity and cooperation,''
Bush said. ``We will move forward not by succumbing to the base
temptations of fear and envy but by following as Abraham Lincoln
said, those better angels of our nature.''
   Bush said Dukakis ``clings, despite all the evidence of the last
two decaes, to the discredited policies of high taxes and
government spending.''
   His comments came in a speech prepared for the Ohio Association
of Broadcasters. Polls show Bush leading in Ohio, which is
considered a must-win state for Dukakis.
   With two weeks remaining until Election Day, Dukakis was seeking
votes in California, where the latest poll showed Bush holding an
11-point lead over the Democratic nominee in the battle for the
state's 47 electoral votes.
   ``George Bush wants to give people like himself a tax break
that's more, in some cases, than the average worker in California
makes in a year,'' Dukakis told supporters in Los Angeles on Monday.
   The Massachusetts governor also accused the GOP ticket of
distorting his record in campaign advertising.
   ``We've seen a campaign of distortions and misrepresentation and
of outright lies now for many, many months,'' Dukakis told a San
Diego audience.
   The Republican nominee, stumping for votes in New England, said
Monday his campaign has ``complete documentation'' for its
commercials criticizing Dukakis on crime and defense.
   ``He cannot take it,'' Bush said of Dukakis. ``He cannot take it
and now he's trying to turn and make the issue what we are saying.''
   The vice president was campaigning today in the Ohio cities of
Columbus, Akron and Lima before flying to Detroit. Bush's running
mate, Dan Quayle, was traveling to Georgia and Florida _ two states
expected to end up in the GOP column on Nov. 8 _ to help Republican
House and Senate candidates.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen was
campaigning in the Dakotas and Montana.
   Dukakis was concentrating on California before heading to
Denver, Colo., where he will campaign as well as continue his
rounds of television interview programs. The Democratic candidate
was appearing on ABC's ``Nightline'' tonight and also promoting his
candidacy in a five-minute spot on NBC.
   On Monday night, in an appearance on the ``Larry King'' show on
Cable News Network, Dukakis was asked whether he had a ``good
shot'' of winning the presidency. ``I think we've got a shot,'' he
replied.
   The Democratic nominee conceded that he should have responded to
the GOP attacks earlier, but said he misunderstood the nature of
the campaign and his earlier message was overshadowed by the furor
over the Quayle selection.
   ``I was campaigning but a lot of attention was devoted to the
(Republican) convention, and then there was about three weeks of
deafening noise about the Quayle selection, which made it very
difficult to get through,'' he said.
   ``What you find out at the convention is that you're suddenly in
a very different world. Who says what for 45 seconds on the 6
o'clock news makes the difference in a particular day, and it took
a while to understand that.''
   On the campaign trail Monday, Dukakis said a reduction in the
tax on capital gains _ profits gained from sales of property such
as stocks or real estate _ would benefit the wealthy, who count
Bush among their ranks.
   ``Consider a taxpayer who reported $515,132 in capital gains
over the last three years,'' Dukakis said. ``Suppose he reports the
same amount over the next three. If the vice president's new plan
is accepted, that taxpayer will get an annual tax break of more
than $22,000.
   ``And what's the name of that taxpayer? George Herbert Walker
Bush.''
   According to aides, Dukakis reported no capital gains during the
past three years.
   The Los Angeles Times, in today's editions, showed Bush leading
Dukakis 53 percent to 42 percent. The poll of 1,376 registered
voters was conducted Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of
error of plus or minus four percentage points.
   Bush, meanwhile, also stressed economic concerns as he
campaigned in Connecticut, Vermont and Maine.
   The vice president said the Republicans have built an economic
revival so strong that it ``can withstand any emergency _ with the
possible exception of a liberal Democrat in the White House.''
   Bush also cautioned voters against taking the election for
granted.
   ``The undecided voters are going to make a big difference,''
Bush said. ``Please don't let up. Don't take anything for granted.
Get that vote out.''
   Quayle, campaigning in Kentucky, echoed his running mate in
urging voters to cast their ballots on Election Day, and also
suggested that the Democrats ``are grasping at any straw'' in
criticizing the GOP ticket.
   Bentsen, addressing a rally at a Baptist church in Little Rock,
Ark., charged that the Republicans ``are bearing false witness
against Michael Dukakis.''
   ``And we're going to set that record straight,'' he said.

   Police arrested 30 people today for questioning in
a fire that destroyed a movie theater showing ``The Last Temptation
of Christ'' and injured 13 people.
   Police said the arrests came in raids aimed at extremist
right-wing groups, but would not indicate what their searches had
disclosed. Authorities said the fire late Saturday was set.
   Several hundred people, including political and film
personalities, demonstrated Monday night in front of the St. Michel
theater in the Latin Quarter. The theater earlier had been the
scene of protests against the film directed by American Martin
Scorsese.
   Mayor Jacques Chirac ``condemned without reservation'' what he
called the ``absurd attack.''
   Among those participating in the demonstration in support of the
film were directors Claude Lelouch and Francis Girod and writer Max
Gallo, who criticized those who ``condemned the film without having
seen it.''
   Earlier Monday, the extreme right National Front party condemned
the ``criminal fire'' but said ``the first violence was that which
wounded millions of believers in their most sacred convictions.''
   ``Last Temptation'' opened in 17 Paris theaters Sept. 28, but
only one theater is still showing the film. Moviegoers have been
met with fires, stink bombs and tear gas.
   The film, based on a novel by Nikos Kasantzakis, portrays Jesus
Christ as having human passions, including a dream sequence in
which he makes love with prostitute Mary Magdalene.

   A firefighter digging through the rubble of a
six-story building found the last survivor when she grabbed his
hand more than eight hours after the structure collapsed.
   ``I'm Robin! Get me out!'' shouted Robin Fischer to rescuers at
the office building in the Manhattan's Garment District.
   Fischer, 27, was in serious but stable condition at Bellevue
Hospital this morning after undergoing leg surgery.
   The owner of the building was killed, and Fischer and 11 others
were injured. Khoder Alsouleh, 25, and his brother Sami, both of
Brooklyn, were reported in serious condition today at Bellvue.
   Everbody who was inside the 60-year-old building when it
collapsed Monday, including a pregnant woman who survived from the
top floor, was accounted for by late Monday, authorities said.
   ``It was like riding a monster, and the only thing you could do
was to hang on,'' said Wilhelm Waight, a 32-year-old delivery man
who survived a fall from the fifth floor with only minor injuries.
``I covered my face with my arms.''
   He said he hit a van in a parking lot, then freed himself from
the rubble.
   The collapse two blocks south of the Empire State Building
crippled transit service just before evening rush hour, affecting
hundreds of thousands of commuters. Subways to New Jersey and the
west side of Manhattan and trains to Long Island were halted more
than an hour.
   Rescuers were worried vibrations from the trains would cause
more of the building to collapse, hampering rescue efforts.
   Authorities did not know for certain what caused the building's
west wall and interior to cave in, but Fire Department spokesman
Efrain Parrilla said a trench had been dug along a wall.
   Buildings Commissioner Charles M. Smith said construction work
had been going on at the building, but that no permits had been
issued. ``It appears they undermined the wall of this building and
it collapsed,'' he said.
   Shelly Smith, 26, who is five months pregnant, works for a
jeweler on the building's top floor. When it collapsed, she slid
down with the debris and emerged with cuts and bruises.
   ``It just collapsed,'' she said. ``I hung onto the floor, I
guess. The building fell into the parking lot. I crawled out.''
   ``It made a sound like a swoosh,'' said Jeff Burgos, who watched
from his store across the street. ``I watched the top floors
crumble. As they fell, men were actually coming out of the side of
the walls, climbing down the debris. It looked like they didn't
have a choice.''
   Fischer, who works for a handbag manufacturer on the sixth
floor, was found buried in packaging and cardboard boxes, which
probably cushioned her from the falling rubble, said Homer Bishop,
chief of operations for the Fire Department.
   Firefighter Joe Hodges began digging in the area when he saw
some boxes move. About 20 minutes later, Fischer was pulled out.
She was crying, said Bishop, ``and so was I.''
   Earlier, rescuers found the body of Frank DeSantis, 64, owner of
the building. DeSantis had been last seen on the roof a few minutes
before the 3 p.m. collapse, said Police Chief Robert Johnson.
   Rescuers crawling through the rubble used listening and infrared
heat-sensing devices in their search for survivors.
   At midnight, officials believed that everyone had been accounted
for, said Bishop.

   Brooklyn-born Rabbi Meir Kahane, the anti-Arab
militant who renounced his U.S. citizenship to run for Israel's
parliament, said today he wants to be an American citizen again.
   Kahane said he planned to fly to the United States on Wednesday
for a fund-raising tour, but U.S. officials said his passport was
no longer valid and he would not be able to use it to gain entry.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Tel Aviv said Kahane formally
renounced his citizenship Sept. 16, and on Oct. 7 the State
Department approved the certificate of loss of nationality.
   On Oct. 18, Kahane appeared before a consular officer in
Jerusalem and asked to reverse the move, said the embassy
spokesman, who requested anonymity. ``We are informing him that the
renunciation can't be reversed but that there is a procedure for
appeal,'' said the spokesman.
   He said Kahane has one year to submit an appeal to the State
Department's Board of Appellate Review. He can also appeal in
federal court.
   Kahane, who founded the militant Jewish Defense League in the
United States, said in a telephone interview that he ``was forced''
to give up his U.S. citizenship by a new amendment to Israeli law
that bars dual nationals from running for Knesset, or parliament.
   On Oct. 5, the Election Commission issued a decision barring
Kahane's anti-Arab Kach party, which polls indicated might win
three or more seats in the Nov. 1 election for the 120-seat
parliament.
   On Oct. 18, the Israeli Supreme Court upheld by a unanimous 5-0
vote the exclusion of Kach on grounds the party was racist. Kahane
advocates the expulsion of all Arabs from Israeli-held territory.
   After the court decision, Kahane said he immediately notified
the U.S. State Department and U.S. Consulate that he wanted to
withdraw his renunciation.
   ``It was conditioned clearly in my application on my Knesset
list being approved,'' said Kahane.
   Kahane claimed the U.S. and Israeli governments had a ``common
interest'' in barring him from making a speaking tour in which he
would condemn Israel's banning of his Kach party.
   Kahane, who immigrated to Israel in 1971, was elected to the
Knesset in 1984. Kahane, who has been barred from Canada and
Britain, said that without U.S. citizenship he might be refused a
visa to travel to the United States.
   In refusing him entry, Canadian officials cited Kahane's July
23, 1971, conviction in New York for possession of explosives,
bombs and other weapons. Kahane served one year of a five-year term
in that case.
   Kahane also has served several jail terms in Israel, including a
one-year administrative detention without trial and three months
for defying an army order barring him from a West Bank town. Both
were related to attempts to establish Jewish settlements.

   Police used tear gas and clubs
today against activists supporting a boycott of Wednesday's
nationwide elections for segregated municipal councils. Archbishop
Desmond Tutu called for an Election Day fast and appealed to all
sides to avoid violence.
   A bomb exploded today in Potchefstroom, southwest of
Johannesburg, extensively damaging a shopping center and slightly
injuring a policeman, police headquarters said.
   It was the second bombing in as many days and police said the
attacks are part of a campaign by the African National Congress
black guerrilla movement to disrupt the elections. On Monday, a car
bombing in Witbank, east of Johannesburg, killed two people and
injured 42.
   In Zwide, near Port Elizabeth, a black candidate was shot and
killed at his home late Monday by an unidentified assailant, a
local newspaper reported.
   Near Cape Town, more than 30 mixed-race high school students
were injured today in a clash with club-wielding police after they
protested the elections, a school official said.
   At Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, more than
1,000 people staged an anti-election rally. Many of them, including
black activist Winnie Mandela, marched to a campus gate where riot
police ordered them to disperse, then fired tear gas.
   Police said officers were being deployed throughout the country
to guard polling stations.
   The Human Rights Commission, a group opposing apartheid, said in
a report today that the elections ``are taking place under a
blanket of silence generated by the repression of anti-apartheid
activists.''
   The commission said about 300 activists had been detained
without charge since Sept. 1, most of them in connection with the
election campaign. The commission also alleged that authorities
were coercing large numbers of blacks into voting.
   Tutu said those who wish to vote, as well as those who boycott,
``should be free to exercise their choice without intimidation.
   ``I want to make an urgent call for a peaceful response to the
elections,'' the Anglican archbiship said in a statement from
church headquarters in Cape Town.
   ``I call on the government not to provoke violence during the
polling and on all those involved in responding to the elections,
whether supporting or opposing them, not to allow intimidation,''
he said.
   Tutu, along with other black anti-apartheid leaders, have been
calling for a national day of protest and a boycott of the
ballotting for segregated municipal councils.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, called for fasting
and prayer but said the he and other anti-apartheid leaders were
not necessarily calling for a general strike.
   Since a state of emergency was declared in 1986, it has been
illegal to call for nationwide strikes.
   The elections mark the first time South Africans of all races
vote at the same time. The white minority government has spent
millions of dollars on advertising to encourage a high black
turnout, seeking support for its claims that it is extending
democracy to blacks even though it denies them a vote in national
elections.
   There are about 5 million whites and 26 million blacks in South
Africa. Roughly half the blacks live in self-governing homelands
not involved in the local elections.
   Critics say black turnout figures this year will be virtually
meaningless because millions of blacks are ineligible to vote and
because no candidates linked to major anti-apartheid groups are
running. Many opposition groups are banned, and most activists view
black town councils as subservient extensions of the
white-controlled central government.
   In the white elections, attention is focused on a showdown
between President P.W. Botha's National Party and the far-right
Conservative Party, which seeks to strengthen segregation laws.
   White anti-apartheid candidates are active in only a few cities.
Their most important battleground is Johannesburg, where they are
underdogs against the National Party in a fight for control of the
city council.

   A high school geometry teacher
suspended for 11 days for wearing jeans and no tie returned to work
today in the same outfit.
   In jeans and a shirt without a tie, Bill Webb showed up to teach
at Point Pleasant High School this morning, according to County
Schools Superintendent Charles Chambers. Chambers said no immediate
action was taken.
   Chambers issued a dress code this year for county school
teachers that bans jeans and requires men to wear neckties.
   The superintendent suspended Webb, 46, without pay Oct. 7. Webb
had just finished a four-day suspension over his refusal to ditch
his jeans and don a tie.
   The Mason County Board of Education upheld the latest suspension
Monday night, and directed Webb to report to work this morning in
proper dress.
   ``I will either get a letter, if they follow the same process
that they have, or there is the possibility that I will be
suspended at the end of the day,'' Webb said. ``I guess there's
even the possibility that they may not let me complete the day.''

<HEAD>Police Say Anderson Photo Appears to Be Copy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today the photograph of American
hostage Terry Anderson that was found in the bag of a Lebanese
woman appears to be a copy and not an original.
   They said they were still examining a photograph of American
hostage Alann Steen, a photograph of an unidentified man and
several documents, including a letter bearing Steen's name. The
photos and documents were discovered in the woman's luggage when
she arrived in Milan.
   Achille Serra, head of the anti-terrorism unit of Milan police,
told reporters police had to check further before determining
whether the photos and letter were part of an effort to free U.S.
hostages in Lebanon, or part of some sort of swindle.
   ``It depends a lot on (Steen's) handwriting,'' Serra said. ``If
the handwriting (sample) .. shows that this letter wasn't written
by Steen, things change a lot. We would be talking about a fraud.''
   He would not say who might have been the object of a possible
swindle. Police were awaiting a handwriting sample from the United
States.
   The photo of Anderson, the longest-held of the foreign hostages
in Lebanon, appeared similar _ in reverse image _ to one issued by
the pro-Iranian group Islamic Jihad in August.
   Serra said he had not seen the earlier photo, but ``I believe,
at least for the time being, you can say that it (the photo) was
not taken of the person himself, it's a photo of a photo.''
   According to police, the Lebanese woman was to turn the photos
and documents over to Aldo Anghessa, an Italian arms trader with
links to Swiss and Italian intelligence agencies.
   The woman, identified as Aline Ibrahim Rizkallah, 36, said she
was to receive about $4,000 from Anghessa, but the Italian has
denied it, police said. She was arrested Thursday after arriving in
Milan from Beirut.
   Serra refused to speculate Tuesday about who was to ultimately
receive the photos and letter. ``We have our suspicions about the
destination, but I guarantee you on my word of honor that we don't
know who was to get it,'' he told a news conference.
   He refused comment on a suggestion he made Monday that an
American organization was the intended destination.
   Serra said police had identified the man who supplied the
Lebanese woman with photographs, documents, 1.7 ounces of heroin
and $1,000 in counterfeit U.S. bills.
   Italian police were considering traveling to Lebanon to question
the man, he said.
   It was unclear why the woman would endanger herself by carrying
small amounts of fake money and heroin. She was jailed for
possessing them.
   Anghessa was not charged because there was no proof the drugs or

<HEAD>Lawyer Ordered to Pay $400,000 in Damages in Amnesty Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer accused of taking fees from more than
400 aliens seeking legalization, and then failing to file their
federal amnesty applications, has been ordered to pay nearly
$400,000 in damages.
   Edward Triwush, whose law license was suspended by the Illinois
Supreme Court earlier this year, was ordered Monday by Circuit
Judge Anthony Scotillo to pay a total of $395,568 in damages to 417
aliens and 11 employers.
   Manuel Sanchez and John Daniels, the lawyers now representing
the aliens, said Triwush took fees ranging from $40 to $850 from
aliens and employers last year, but did not file applications in
the amnesty program granting legal residency for those who had
lived continuously in the United States since 1982.
   The deadline for applications was May 1.
   During the six months that he was accepting fees, Triwush
continued to work although the Illinois Supreme Court suspended his
license for his failure to file a brief in an unrelated case,
officials said.
   The Supreme Court later ordered Triwush jailed for 30 days, but
suspended the sentence after he agreed to make restitution of
$90,000 to the aliens and employers, representing the amount of
fees accepted during the six-month suspension. He was ordered to
appear Nov. 15 to explain he should not be held in contempt. The
Supreme Court could reimpose the jail sentence at that time.
   None of the $90,000 had been repaid, Daniels said.
   Scotillo imposed the judgment Monday after Triwush failed to
comply with requests for information from Sanchez and Daniels.
   Daniels said Triwush also pleaded guilty to theft in Lake County
Circuit Court for accepting fees from aliens but failing to file
any documents. Triwush was placed on 30 months' probation and
ordered to make resitution in that case, officials said.
   He has an unlisted telephone number in Chicago and could not be
reached.

   A Pakistani jetliner with 415 passengers
aboard landed safely today after two of its four engines failed
when the plane hit a flock of seagulls, an Istanbul airport
official said.
   The Pakistani International Airlines jet struck the birds as it
was taking off from Istanbul, the source said. The plane dumped 40
tons of fuel into the Marmara Sea and then returned to Ataturk
Airport, the official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the jet
landed 57 minutes after hitting the seagulls.
   The plane had been scheduled to fly from Islamabad to London
with stops in Istanbul and Amsterdam.
   The semi-official Anatolia news agency said the passengers were
scheduled to fly to London later today on another Pakistani
jetliner.
   The agency said experts determined the damaged aircraft's two
engines suffered considerable damage and would have to be replaced.

   Soviet world champion Garri Kasparov
today won the third World Cup chess tournament.
   Kasparov led with 11 points after drawing with Predrag Nikolic
of Yugoslavia in the final game of the 17-round contest. Kasparov
received $20,000 in prize money.
   Alexander Belyavsky of the Soviet Union was second with 10.5
points and received $15,000. Mikhail Tal of the Soviet Union was
third with 10 points.
   Belyavsky and Kasparov went into the final round sharing the
lead with 10.5 points each. But Boris Spassky beat Belyavsky in the
final round and, as a result, Belyavsky scored no points. Kasparov
scored half a point for his draw with Nikolic.
   Winning a game scores one point, a draw is worth a half point.
   Kasparov's victory places him in the lead in the six-tournament
World Cup series with a total of 56.5 points, two points ahead of
former Soviet world champion Anatoly Karpov.
   Karpov did not play in the Reykjavik tournament.
   The World Cup series is the second most important event in chess
after the individual world championship organized by the world
chess federation. The six tournaments in the World Cup series,
which will end in 1989, are spread over two years and the prize
money totals $1.2 million.
   The first tournament in the series, held in Brussels, was won by
Karpov. Kasparov won the second tournament in Belfort, France. The
fourth tournament will be held in Barcelona, Spain, the fifth in
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and the sixth in Skelleftea, Sweden.

   Tropical Storm Miriam turned away from the
Pacific coast after heavy rains cut short a cycling race in
Guatemala and sent children home from school early in southern
Mexico.
   Guatemala, El Salvador and southern Mexico, barely affected by
the storm that left at least 111 dead in five other Latin American
countries, called off states of alert that had been in effect
Sunday and Monday.
   As Hurricane Joan, the storm killed 21 people in Costa Rica,
four in Panama, 25 in Colombia and 11 in Venezuela. It also claimed
50 lives in Nicaragua as it tore from the Atlantic to the Pacific
before being downgraded to a tropical storm and renamed Miriam.
   The storm affected all Central American countries except tiny
Belize and left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
   Forecasters had feared it would regain strength and become a
hurricane again as it reached the warm waters of the Pacific, but
it did not.
   At 11 a.m. EDT, Miriam's center was near latitude 14.8 north,
longitude 94.2 west, or about 75 miles off the coast of Mexico in
the Gulf of Tehuantepec, according to the National Hurricane Center
in Coral Gables, Fla.
   The center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of near 50
mph and was expected today to resume heading west northwest at
about nine mph. A storm becomes a hurricane when maximum sustained
winds reach 74 mph.
   Flash flood and mud slide warnings remained in effect today for
Guatemala and El Salvador.
   About 1,500 people living near coastal rivers in El Salvador
were evacuated Monday. The airport opened Monday morning after
being closed Sunday.
   In Guatemala, bicyclists competing in the rain during the fifth
day of a two-week cycling tour were excused from 10 miles of the
race because of the rain. Despite light flooding in southern
Guatemala, officials said evacuations were not necessary.
   Nicaragua suffered the most from Hurricane Joan as it lashed the
Caribbean coast and then ripped its way over land to the Pacific.
   The Nicaraguan government said about 300,000 people were
homeless and at least 40 people were missing.
   Bluefields, a Nicaraguan port city on the Caribbean with a
population of 38,000, was in tatters with at least 6,000 homes
destroyed and few buildings still with roofs. Officials said at
least 21 people were killed in Bluefields.
   In Managua, the storm toppled electrical towers and tore down
telephone lines and trees. Many people living beside riverbeds lost
their homes.
   Much of the Nicaraguan capital remained without electric power
or drinking water Monday and the government ordered schools to
remain closed so schoolchildren could help with reconstruction work.
   In an interview broadcast on state radio Monday, Agrarian Reform
Minister Jaime Wheelock said floods and strong winds caused the
heavy damage to three basic foods _ rice, beans and bananas _ and
also affected export crops such as coffee, cotton and sugar cane.
   The storm destroyed almost all 2,470 acres of coconut palms and
80 percent of the African palm plantations in southern Nicaragua
and 40 percent of the banana plantations, he said.
   The first relief flights arrived in Managua and Bluefields on
Sunday, carrying doctors, food and medicine from Cuba. The Mexican
government flew in relief supplies Monday, Mexican television said.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater claimed
President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua was using the storm tragedy as
propaganda against the Reagan administration's support of rebels
fighting the country's leftist Sandinista government.
   Fitzwater said no request for U.S. aid had been received from
the Nicaraguan government and none was expected.
   Nicaragua appealed for international aid but Ortega said ``the
best humanitarian the United States could give us would be to stop
its terrorist policies against Nicaragua.''
   The Nicaraguan government estimates that the 7-year-old war with
the rightist rebels, known as Contras, has inflicted $12 billion
worth of damage on the country.

<HEAD>Steinberg Trial to Begin Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lisa Steinberg, whose death last year became a
symbol of child abuse in America, was viciously beaten by the only
father she ever knew, a prosecutor charged this morning as the
murder trial of Joel Steinberg began.
   Lisa died on Nov. 5 when she was removed from a respirator, but
``she was really killed days earlier,'' Assistant District Attorney
Peter Casolaro told the jury. ``Steinberg beat Lisa so severely
that he inflicted those injures which caused her death.''
   Casolaro told the panel that ``graphic and grotesque'' evidence
and testimony will prove Steinberg murdered the child. Six-year-old
Lisa was found unconscious in the Steinberg apartment early Nov. 2,
1987, and died of her injuries three days later.
   Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer who took the child illegally at
birth from an unwed Long Island teen-ager, is charged with
second-degree murder.
   Defense attorney Ira London said the evidence would not support
the prosecution's claim.
   ``It will not be proven in this case that Lisa Steinberg was
murdered, nor will it be prove that Lisa was a battered child,''
London said in a brief opening in which he also attacked Hedda
Nussbaum, Steinberg's longtime live-in companion and an anticipated
key prosecution witness.
   London called Ms. Nussbaum ``delusional,'' mentioned she had
spent the last year in a mental hospital and alluded to her
``romance with Satanic cults.''
   Following the opening statement, a paramedic who arrived at the
Steinberg home to find Lisa unconcious and her brother Mitchell
tethered to a playpen took the stand as the trial's first witness.
   Steinberg denies ever hitting Lisa; he claims she was sickened
by food, and the bruises on her back and chest resulted from his
trying to revive her after she fell unconscious the night of Nov.
1, 1987.
   Justice Harold Rothwax ruled Monday that prosecutors may tell
jurors that Ms. Nussbaum, 46, waited at least 10 hours before she
called for help for the comatose child because she was terrified of
Steinberg.
   No help was called for Lisa until after 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 2,
court records show. When police and medical technicians arrived,
they found the girl unconscious and a 16-month-old boy, called
Mitchell, tethered to his playpen, lying in a soiled diaper and
drinking spoiled milk.
   Lisa was pronounced brain dead at nearby St. Vincent's Hospital
at 8:55 a.m. on Nov. 5.
   The six men and six women who will hear the case, which is
expected to last four to eight weeks, will likely hear testimony
about child abuse, beatings, drug abuse, sadomasochism and illegal
adoptions.
   Ms. Nussbaum was charged along with Steinberg in Lisa's death,
but never indicted. After her arrest, she underwent surgery and
psychiatric treatment for injuries allegedly inflicted by
Steinberg. The prosecution has said all charges against her
probably will be dropped.

<HEAD>Nancy Reagan Urges Arrest Of Wall Street Cocaine Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Nancy Reagan today called for a
home front war on individual drug users and said authorities should
arrest Wall Street bankers buying cocaine during lunch.
   It is as important to stop drug use in the United States, she
said, as it is to top cocoa growing in Peru, processing in Colombia
and shipping through the Caribbean.
   ``It is often easier to make strong speeches about foreign drug
lords or drug smugglers,'' she said, ``than to arrest a pair of
Wall Street investment bankers buying cocaine on their lunch
break.''
   Mrs. Reagan, who often has campaigned against drug use during
her husband's presidency, called for a new crusade against drug use
at home during a speech to the U.N. Third Committee on Social and
Humanitarian affairs.
   The Reagan administration has emphasized interdiction and
stopping illegal drugs from entering the country, especially from
Latin America. But Mrs. Reagan said the battle also must be fought
at home.
   ``The drug user is an accomplice to every criminal act, every
murder, every terrotist attack carried out by the narcotics
syndicates,'' said Mrs. Reagan, who wore a mulberry-colored dress
and heavy golden jewelry.
   ``If we lack the will to fully mobilize the forces of law in our
own country to arrest and punish drug users, if we cannot stem the
American demand for drugs,'' she said, ``then there will be little
hope of preventing foreign drug producers from fulfilling that
demand ... Drugs must remain illegal at every step in the chain.''
   She was accompanied by Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters. She earlier met
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Mrs. Reagan said the international efforts against drugs are of
vital importance and must be expanded. ``Drug traffickers are
international criminals who deserve no rest or sanctuary,'' she
said.
   But she emphasized that ``it is the United States alone which
bears responsibility for its own drug problem. I am not blaming
other nations for America's drug problem. While most of the illegal
drugs are imported, the drug users are home-grown.''
   To get serious about stopping illegal drugs, she said, ``there
can be no substitute for focusing on the user and that means
confronting all those citizens who use drugs.''
   ``We need to educate a generation to ``Just Say, `No','' to
drugs,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``And in the meantime, we must continue
our fight against the production, processing, financing,
importation, sale and use of illegal drugs.''

<HEAD>Western Voters Feel Robbed When TV Projects Winners Early</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you've ever been robbed, says Rep. Al Swift,
you know how some West Coast voters felt in the last two
presidential elections when TV networks declared a winner hours
before their polls closed.
   ``When people are told the election is over before they've even
voted, it tends to convey that their vote doesn't count,'' said
Swift, a Washington state Democrat.
   ``It's like being robbed _ a combination of feeling violated and
helpless,'' he said. ``You're angry, but you don't know who to
hit.''
   For eight years, Swift and other Western politicians have looked
for someone to hit, as they try to put a little suspense back into
election night for their constituents.
   But their battle against the ``time zone factor'' has been
frustrated by congressional inaction, court challenges and lack of
firm evidence that election-night projections of winners do any
real harm.
   Despite their crusade, election coverage on network television
Nov. 8 promises to differ little from 1980 or 1984, analysts say,
and it may even bring news of the winner _ George Bush or Michael
Dukakis _ in record time.
   Projections of presidential winners have been made since the
1964 Goldwater-Johnson race. They are based on exit polls, in which
voters leaving a balloting place are asked at random how they voted
and why. Personal information such as age and sex also is recorded.
   The polls and projections have grown steadily in speed and
accuracy.
   In 1980, when Ronald Reagan scored his unexpected landslide over
President Carter, NBC declared Reagan the winner at 5:15 p.m.
Pacific time, or 8:15 pm. on the East Coast.
   CBS and ABC quickly followed suit, prompting Carter to concede
publicly more than an hour before California polling booths closed
at 8 p.m.
   In 1984, the three major networks had declared Reagan's victory
by 5:30 p.m. Pacific time, or 8:30 p.m. Eastern time.
   The 1980 projections infuriated many Western politicans and
voters. Election observers reported seeing prospective voters step
out of line after learning of Reagan's apparent victory. Democratic
leaders in the West complained that Carter's early concession hurt
their efforts to get voters to the polls in close local races.
   But network executives argued, then and now, that giving the
early word to Western voters is unavoidable in a country spread
across four time zones, or six if Alaska and Hawaii are counted.
   ``It may be unpalatable for voters in the West, but it would be
unprofessional to have knowledge that we know to be true and not
give it,'' said Robert Siegenthaler, ABC vice president for news
operations.
   Legislators in many states rejected that argument and sought to
restrict exit polling on the ground that its results intimidate
voters.
   Nearly half the states have enacted restrictions limiting how
close exit pollsters may work near balloting areas, said Floyd
Abrams, a network attorney.
   He said the three networks filed lawsuits this year in six
states with the most stringent curbs on exit polling. The networks
said the restrictions violated their First Amendment guarantees of
freedom of speech.
   Federal judges agreed, striking down statutes in Washington,
Montana, Georgia and Florida. Last week, a judge ruled that
Wyoming's exit poll restrictions were unconstitutional. Abrams said
he expects a favorable pre-election ruling in Minnesota.
   ``It's unlikely there will be any problems on Election Day with
this issue,'' Abrams said.
   Swift said it is up to Congress, not the states, to correct the
problem.
   In 1985, Congress extracted a promise from the three networks
not to project a presidential winner in any state where any polls
are still open.
   Network officials said last week they will stick with that
policy on Nov. 8, though NBC hedged a little by saying its
newscasters may ``characterize'' statewide elections before the
polls close.
   ``We don't project a winner until the polls close, but we might
say that so-and-so is ahead,'' said Helen Manasian, spokeswoman for
NBC's election coverage.
   With the networks' limited promise in hand, Swift urged Congress
to take the next step by ordering all polling booths closed at 9
p.m. Eastern time. In the West, that would be achieved by extending
Daylight Savings Time by two weeks each election year and closing
polls at 7 p.m. local time.
   Swift's bill has passed the House twice but died in the Senate.
He said he doesn't know if he'll try again.
   Critics of Swift's proposal say that while election-night
projections might spoil the surprise for Western voters, studies
have failed to show that they discourage significant numbers of
people from voting.
   Swift concedes the lack of such evidence but argues that
Westerners may grow disillusioned even though they vote.
   The importance of an individual's vote ``is the basic building
block of democracy,'' he said. ``When people lose confidence in
that, I think that's dangerous.''
   But Jeff Alderman, ABC director of polling, said the networks
are hardly to blame for voter disillusionment.
   ``We spend a lot of time focusing on the alleged influence of
polling and coverage in general,'' Alderman said. ``But it's not
network television's job to give people a stake in the election.
It's up to the people running, and they're not doing it.''

   The Supreme Court today blocked Wednesday's
scheduled execution in Mississippi of convicted murderer Leo
Edwards.
   The justices, by an 8-0 vote, granted Edwards the emergency stay
pending further appeals in his case. Justice Antonin Scalia did not
take part in the decision.
   Edwards, 33, was due to be executed at 12:01 a.m. in the gas
chamber at Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman.
   He was convicted of murder in the June 1980 robbery-slaying of
Linzy Don Dixon at a Jackson, Miss., convenience store. Dixon, 24,
a store clerk, was gunned down while he was on the telephone. The
robbery netted $111, authorities said.
   Edwards, of New Orleans, had escaped from a Louisiana prison at
the time.

   The U.S. Supreme Court today stayed the
execution of convicted murderer Leo Edwards, who was to die
Wednesday.
   Edwards, 33, was convicted in April 1981 of capital murder in
the June 1980 murder of a convenience store clerk in Jackson,
during a robbery which netted $111.
   Edwards, of New Orleans, was an escapee from a Louisiana prison
at the time he went on a spree of robberies and killings in Hinds
and Madison counties.
   Edwards' attorney, Kenneth Rose of Jackson, has contended that
prosecutors systematically excluded blacks as potential juros thus
denying Edwards, who is black, a trial by a cross-section of the
community.
   Edwards was convicted by an all-white jury.
   A federal judge in Jackson, and the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans had rejected that argument.

   President Reagan today signed legislation
creating the Department of Veterans Affairs, telling vets they
deserve ``a seat at the table of our national affairs.''
   In signing into law the bill establishing the 14th Cabinet-level
agency, Reagan made an election-year exception to his oft-stated
opposition to expanding the size of federal government.
   At the conclusion of a speech to the National Defense University
at Fort McNair in the District of Columbia, the president said that
the nation's debt to its military men and women ``does not end the
day the uniform comes off.''
   ``All of those who have served in America's uniform deserve the
nation's thanks,'' he said.
   Reagan noted that the legislation has been in the works for 13
years, and said that ``it's something that I've been looking
forward to for a long, long time.''
   ``This bill gives those who have borne America's battles, who
defended the borders of freedom, who protected our nation's
security in war and peace, it gives them what they have deserved
for so long _ a seat at the table of our national affairs,'' he
told a crowd that included Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci;
Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
congressional sponsors of the bill.
   ``I like to think that this bill gives Cabinet rank not just to
an agency of government, but to every single veteran,'' Reagan
said. ``Welcome aboard!''
   Throughout his political career, Reagan has railed against ``big
government'' in Washington. He has used numerous speeches during
the current presidential campaign to warn that Democrats would
return the nation to the era of ``Big Brother'' and ``Big
Government.''
   But neither Reagan nor Vice President George Bush showed any
such qualms this year about the bill creating a new Department of
Veterans Affairs, the 14th Cabinet-level agency and one devoted to
pursuing the interests of a select group of individuals.
   The House and Senate also paid election-year homage to the
nation's 27 million veterans, with both chambers giving easy
approval to the bill earlier this fall.
   In approving the change, the House rejected arguments that
setting up the new department would lead ultimately to increased
spending and admonitions that it was engaging in an election-year
ploy.
   Supporters of the legislation argued that the Veterans
Administration already has the fifth-largest budget among federal
agencies and merits being put on par with other Cabinet departments.
   The VA serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or
survivors with a budget of $30 billion. It will dispense $14
billion in income maintenance and $626 million for education and
rehabilitation assistance this year.
   On Monday, Reagan signed legislation with little fanfare
authorizing the Department of Defense to close U.S. military
installations considered unnecessary. The president gave that
politically sensitive issue a much lower profile, with his
signature of the bill noted only in a White House press release.
   That bill has the potential of saving the government up to $5
billion a year as Pentagon officials pare down the list of 3,800
U.S. military installations.
   It sets up a complicated base-closing procedure which
essentially cuts through a thicket of laws enacted by Congress in
the past decade to thwart Pentagon efforts to shut down bases.

<HEAD>Western Voters Feel Robbed When TV Projects Winners Early</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If you've ever been robbed, says Rep. Al Swift,
you know how some West Coast voters felt in the last two
presidential elections when TV networks declared a winner hours
before their polls closed.
   ``When people are told the election is over before they've even
voted, it tends to convey that their vote doesn't count,'' said
Swift, a Washington state Democrat.
   ``It's like being robbed _ a combination of feeling violated and
helpless,'' he said. ``You're angry, but you don't know who to
hit.''
   For eight years, Swift and other Western politicians have looked
for someone to hit, as they try to put a little suspense back into
election night for their constituents.
   But their battle against the ``time zone factor'' has been
frustrated by congressional inaction, court challenges and lack of
firm evidence that election-night projections of winners do any
real harm.
   Despite their crusade, election coverage on network television
Nov. 8 promises to differ little from 1980 or 1984, analysts say,
and it may even bring news of the winner _ George Bush or Michael
Dukakis _ in record time.
   Projections of presidential winners have been made since the
1964 Goldwater-Johnson race. They are based on exit polls, in which
voters leaving a balloting place are asked at random how they voted
and why. Personal information such as age and sex also is recorded.
   The polls and projections have grown steadily in speed and
accuracy.
   In 1980, when Ronald Reagan scored his unexpected landslide over
President Carter, NBC declared Reagan the winner at 5:15 p.m.
Pacific time, or 8:15 pm. on the East Coast.
   CBS and ABC quickly followed suit, prompting Carter to concede
publicly more than an hour before California polling booths closed
at 8 p.m.
   In 1984, the three major networks had declared Reagan's victory
by 5:30 p.m. Pacific time, or 8:30 p.m. Eastern time.
   The 1980 projections infuriated many Western politicans and
voters. Election observers reported seeing prospective voters step
out of line after learning of Reagan's apparent victory. Democratic
leaders in the West complained that Carter's early concession hurt
their efforts to get voters to the polls in close local races.
   But network executives argued, then and now, that giving the
early word to Western voters is unavoidable in a country spread
across four time zones, or six if Alaska and Hawaii are counted.
   ``It may be unpalatable for voters in the West, but it would be
unprofessional to have knowledge that we know to be true and not
give it,'' said Robert Siegenthaler, ABC vice president for news
operations.
   Legislators in many states rejected that argument and sought to
restrict exit polling on the ground that its results intimidate
voters.
   Nearly half the states have enacted restrictions limiting how
close exit pollsters may work near balloting areas, said Floyd
Abrams, a network attorney.
   He said the three networks filed lawsuits this year in six
states with the most stringent curbs on exit polling. The networks
said the restrictions violated their First Amendment guarantees of
freedom of speech.
   Federal judges agreed, striking down statutes in Washington,
Montana, Georgia and Florida. Last week, a judge ruled that
Wyoming's exit poll restrictions were unconstitutional. Abrams said
he expects a favorable pre-election ruling in Minnesota.
   ``It's unlikely there will be any problems on Election Day with
this issue,'' Abrams said.
   Swift said it is up to Congress, not the states, to correct the
problem.
   In 1985, Congress extracted a promise from the three networks
not to project a presidential winner in any state where any polls
are still open.
   Network officials said last week they will stick with that
policy on Nov. 8, though NBC hedged a little by saying its
newscasters may ``characterize'' statewide elections before the
polls close.
   ``We don't project a winner until the polls close, but we might
say that so-and-so is ahead,'' said Helen Manasian, spokeswoman for
NBC's election coverage.
   With the networks' limited promise in hand, Swift urged Congress
to take the next step by ordering all polling booths closed at 9
p.m. Eastern time. In the West, that would be achieved by extending
Daylight Savings Time by two weeks each election year and closing
polls at 7 p.m. local time.
   Swift's bill has passed the House twice but died in the Senate.
He said he doesn't know if he'll try again.
   Critics of Swift's proposal say that while election-night
projections might spoil the surprise for Western voters, studies
have failed to show that they discourage significant numbers of
people from voting.
   Swift concedes the lack of such evidence but argues that
Westerners may grow disillusioned even though they vote.
   The importance of an individual's vote ``is the basic building
block of democracy,'' he said. ``When people lose confidence in
that, I think that's dangerous.''
   But Jeff Alderman, ABC director of polling, said the networks
are hardly to blame for voter disillusionment.
   ``We spend a lot of time focusing on the alleged influence of
polling and coverage in general,'' Alderman said. ``But it's not
network television's job to give people a stake in the election.
It's up to the people running, and they're not doing it.''

<HEAD>Reagan Ups Ante in Diplomatic Tiff with Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua diplomats and other officials will
be denied visas to enter the United States under a proclamation
signed by President Reagan, the White House announced today.
   The action is another step in the diplomatic conflict between
the Sandinista government and the Reagan administration, which
dates back to July 11, when Managua expelled U.S. Ambassador
Richard Melton and seven other diplomats.
   The United States retaliated the next day by expelling
Nicaraguan ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven others.
   Since then, the Sandinista government has not acted on U.S.
attempts to replace the expelled U.S. envoy to the Central American
nation.
   Reagan, in his proclamation, says he found ``the unrestricted
... entry of officers and employees of the Nicaraguan government
and the Sandinista National Liberation Front ... to be detrimental
to the interests of the United States.''
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk pointed out that the
presidential action comes not only in the wake of the July
explusions, but also in light of further restrictions placed on
U.S. officials in Nicaragua.
   ``We've been trying to get our people replaced, and we haven't
gotten anywhere,'' Popadiuk said.
   He noted that on Sept. 22, the Sandinista government required
that American diplomats based in Nicaragua who leave the country,
for whatever reason, must wait three weeks before they are allowed
to re-enter Nicaragua.
   At the time, the administration said it would take some type of
retaliatory action, but did not state what it would be.
   Diplomats already posted to the Nicaraguan embassy in Washington
are unaffected by the proclamation. Officials assigned now or in
the future to the Nicaraguan U.N. mission in New York or the
mission to the Organization of American States in Washington are
also unaffected.

<HEAD>Proxmire's Successor: Millionaire Businessman or Female State
Senator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD EGGLESTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millionaire businessman Herbert Kohl won
Wisconsin's Democratic Senate primary in the face of charges he was
buying the election with personal wealth _ a far cry from the
penny-pinching campaigns of William Proxmire, the man he hopes to
succeed.
   In the most recent general election polling, Kohl also has been
leading the Republican nominee, state Senate Minority Leader Susan
Engeleiter. But GOP officials say she still can win, and an
appearance by President Reagan on her behalf has been promised
before the election.
   Engeleiter, 36, of Brookfield, would be the first woman
Wisconsin has sent to Congress. She also would be the younger than
any current member of the U.S. Senate.
   Whoever wins, the battle has ended a tradition of low-cost
campaigns that Proxmire established in his 31 years in Washington.
The retirement of Proxmire, who will turn 73 three days after the
election, also ends an era of statewide, personal campaigning that
spurned the use of paid advertising.
   Proxmire, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, often
focused on issues of what he saw as government waste during his
long political career.
   Kohl, 53, of Milwaukee, already has set a record for election
spending in Wisconsin, contributing $3.84 million of his own money
to his first try at public office. His campaign had raised $4.28
million in all through Sept. 30.
   Engeleiter had raised $1.33 million.
   Proxmire reported spending just $145.10 to win re-election in
1982, down from $177.25 in 1976.
   Kohl's personal wealth and his many personal business dealings
have become an issue in the campaign.
   He had an income of $4.2 million last year, according to his
accountant. Engeleiter and her husband, Gerald, reported an income
of $130,000.
   Kohl's Democratic primary election opponents tried to persuade
voters he was buying the election. And Engeleiter has portrayed
herself as a middle-class candidate in the state's political
mainstream, a ``Wisconsin original.''
   But Engeleiter's family income is above average for Wisconsin
and Kohl lives relatively simply, eating breakfast most mornings at
a working-class diner in his Milwaukee neighborhood.
   He has refused political action committee donations and
campaigned on the theme ``Nobody's senator but yours.''
   In one well-publicized campaign controversy, Engeleiter said
Kohl owned a controlling interest in a San Antonio, Texas, bakery
that did most of its business with the Defense Department.
   Kohl said he began selling Sterling Bakery Inc. when he decided
to run for the Senate, and completed the sale in September.
   The issue backfired on Engeleiter when she hinted Kohl had
overcharged the Pentagon for coffee cake. Kohl showed the price per
pound was lower than the charges for a similar cake at the
supermarket that bears his family name.
   He is the former owner of a chain of supermarkets and department
stores. In 1985, after he sold the stores, he spent $18.5 million
to acquire the Milwaukee Bucks professional basketball team.
   Engeleiter contends Kohl should make more complete financial
disclosure, but interviews and polls indicate the issue has had
little effect on voters.
   ``There are basic issues beneath the surface, but the dynamics
seem to be personal,'' said University of Wisconsin history
professor Margaret Bogue.
   State Historian William F. Thompson suggests that voters seem to
be turned off this election, another departure from the past.
   ``Wisconsin traditionally has taken politics seriously, as
opposed to cynically,'' Thompson said.
   Kohl led Engeleiter 57 percent to 34 percent among likely voters
surveyed Oct. 6 and Oct. 7 by the Milwaukee Journal, but Republican
strategists still contend Engeleiter could prevail.
   ``This is a very winnable race,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., who came to Wisconsin to campaign for Engeleiter last week.
   Still, Kohl's forces seem comfortable with their lead, and other
Democrats are counting on Kohl's coattails to help retain their
majorities in the Legislature.
   Engeleiter tends to support the national Republican ticket and
party platform on defense and budget issues but is more liberal on
social issues. She supports a woman's right to choose abortion,
while the GOP platform opposes abortion.
   Kohl has called for sharp cuts in defense spending, but supports
continued research, although not deployment, of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, known as ``Star Wars.'' He favors increased
spending for social programs, including education.
   Past holders of the Senate seat are a varied lot, including Sen.
Joseph R. McCarthy, censured by colleagues in the 1950s, and Sens.
Robert M. La Follette, father and son, both of whom clashed with
the Republican establishment and played prominent roles in the
Progressive movement.

<HEAD>FDA Approves New Drug For Treatment of Cancer-Related Diarrhea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drugs Administration on Tuesday
approved a new drug for controlling a type of diarrhea that often
kills patients with intestinal cancer.
   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said the new drug, called
octreotide acetate, ``can dramatically improve the life'' of
patients with malignant carcinoid tumors and vasoactive intestinal
peptide-secreting tumors.
   These cancers grow slowly and often are not diagnosed until
after they have spread and become inoperable. The malignancies
themselves often are not fatal for up to 20 years, but they cause a
severe and frequent diarrhea that can cripple and even kill.
   Young said the new drug will permit many patients with the
intestinal cancer to live normal lives ``rather than be weakened
and continually hospitalized.''
   ``For many, it will reduce or eliminate the frequent and
devastating bouts of diarrhea that often require repeated
hospitalizations for intravenous fluid replacement therapy,'' he
said.
   About one or two people per million in the United States develop
the intestinal cancer annually. The cancer often goes undiagnosed
for seven or eight years. Though patients can live with the cancer
for years, it causes heavy secretions of peptides, a type of
protein which triggers severe and unrelenting diarrhea, along with
wheezing, heart problems and loss of energy.
   The new drug does not attack the cancer, but controls secretion
of the peptides. The drug mimics the action of somatostatine, a
naturally occurring hormone that regulates secretions by the organs
in the body, and prevents excess release of the peptides. This, in
turn, eliminates the cause of the diarrhea.
   Officials said the drug is administered by injection. It was
developed in the Sandoz Ltd. laboratories in Basel, Switzerland,
and approved by the FDA after major clinical trials in this
country. It will be marketed under the name Sandostatin.
   The FDA said that since some patients on the drug developed
gallstones, ultrasonic monitoring of patients is recommended.

<HEAD>Bitter Battle Over Gay Rights Measure in Colorado City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed amendment to the city
charter that would ban discrimination against homosexuals has
pitted conservative clergymen against a coalition of advocates for
civil liberties and gay rights.
   The proposal on the Nov. 8 ballot would prohibit discrimination
in jobs, housing or public accommodations because of sexual
orientation.
   ``We believe discrimination is fundamentally wrong. It goes
against the health and well-being of our entire community,'' the
Coalition for Civil Rights, a proponent of the amendment, said in a
statement.
   Opponents argue that anti-discrimination laws should not apply
to homosexuality because it is a chosen lifestyle. Others have
called homosexuality a ``perversion'' and have prominently
mentioned acquired immune deficiency syndrome, for which sexually
active gay men are at high risk.
   One minister who opposes the measure has threatened to go on
radio and television if the amendment is approved and declare that
the northern Colorado city is the place for homosexuals to be.
   The Rev. Pete Peters said his congregation, the LaPorte Church
of Christ, has pledged to spend $4,000 to defeat the amendment.
Last week, he began criticizing the proposal in a series of paid,
two-hour radio broadcasts on a local station that prompted a flurry
of angry calls from listeners. He also plans to buy time on a local
cable television.
   ``I'm going to go on my program and let the homosexuals around
the nation know that Fort Collins is the place to come to'' if the
amendment is passed, said Peters.
   Other clergymen, however, have spoken out in favor of the
proposal.
   Its supporters are conducting a low-key, door-to-door campaign
and have focused on collecting endorsements from groups such as the
Colorado Psychological Association, the American Public Health
Association and the National Organization for Women.

   Discovery's astronauts returned to
the scene of last month's first post-Challenger shuttle launch
Tuesday to thank space workers and praise them as the ``heartbeat of
America's space program.''
   ``What made the vehicle lift off the launch pad was not the solid
fuel booster rockets or the main engines; what was pushing us was
all your good feelings and the work and dedication and care you put
into it,'' astronaut George D. Nelson told a crowd of several
thousand people assembled in a parking lot near the launch control
center.
   ``If there's a heartbeat of America's space program, it's here at
the Kennedy Space Center,'' said Discovery pilot Richard O. Covey.
``We congratulate you for the role you played in helping us pull off
this very successful mission.''
   Frederick H. Hauck, Discovery's commander, presented the workers
with an autograph book which he and his crew carried into orbit. It
contains the signatures of more than 15,000 technicians, engineers,
managers, clerical and other space center staffers who signed it
before launch.
   In accepting the book, center director Forrest S. McCartney said
it would be displayed prominently and ``become part of the Kennedy
Space Center's history.''
   Hauck also presented McCartney with a picture montage that
included shuttle launchings and a photograph of the seven astronauts
killed when the Challenger exploded Jan. 28, 1986. McCartney
presented all five astronauts with a framed picture of Discovery's
liftoff.
   Looking ahead to the next flight, Nelson pointed to the huge
Vehicle Assembly Building across the street and noted that Atlantis
was in there being prepared for a late November liftoff, with a
five-man crew commanded by Robert ``Hoot'' Gibson.
   ``In this building behind me is Hoot's rocket,'' he said.
``Please get Hoot off the planet for awhile.'' And then he added,
``We ain't seen nothing yet.''
   The ceremony was a continuation of celebrations for Hauck,
Nelson, Covey and the other crew members, David C. Hilmers and John
M. Lounge.
   Since their four-day flight ended Oct. 3, they have been honored
by President Reagan at the White House, visited Congress and were
feted at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, at the Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., and in a motorcade in Cocoa
Beach, the community south of the Kennedy Space Center.

<HEAD>Harrah's Reno Employees Suspended For Refusing to Wear Anti-Drug
Ribbon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several Harrah's Reno employees have been
suspended without pay for just saying no to management's order to
wear a ribbon at work proclaiming themselves ``drug free.''
   Ronald Jeffrey, general manager of the club, said five or six
employees were suspended Sunday and Monday, although some workers
claim the number is closer to a dozen.
   The suspensions came because the red ribbons saying ``The choice
for me, Drug Free!'' were made part of the resort's dress, and the
employees were out of uniform by refusing to wear the ribbons,
Jeffrey said Monday.
   But attorney David Houston, who represents four of the suspended
workers, said Harrah's Reno violated the employees' First Amendment
rights by forcing them to wear what amounts to a statement about
drugs.
   ``The issue is: When does the casino recognize the right of
expression of its own employees ... not to adopt the position of the
employer?'' Houston said.
   Houston said he was attempting to negotiate with the casino but
might file suit.
   Dennis Gallagher, general counsel for Harrah's Reno, said the
suspended employees will have to go through an internal grievance
proceeding to be reinstated.
   More than 50,000 ribbons were distributed to schools, government
agencies and businesses in Nevada by the Governor's Alliance for a
Drug Free Nevada in observance of National Drug Free America Week,
which began Sunday.
   The suspended employees, who did not want to be named for fear of
recrimination, said they did not refuse to wear the ribbons because
they use illegal drugs. Instead, many said they consume alcoholic
drinks and coffee and smoke cigarettes so it would have been
hypocritical to say they were drug free.
   Harrah's Reno made the ribbon wearing voluntary Monday afternoon
after officials said they ran out of ribbons.

   A single-engine airplane that developed engine
trouble shortly after takeoff made a safe landing Tuesday on
Interstate 71. No one was hurt.
   Only pilot Steve Rogers, 34, of Vienna, Va., was aboard the
two-seater Cessna 180. He had taken off from Lunken Airport in
Cincinnati and was on his way to Carrollton when the engine quit
because of a possible fuel leak.
   ``I was pretty close to the expressway, and there wasn't a lot of
traffic so I landed on it'' at 9:29 a.m., he said.
   After touching down on southbound I-71 just north of the Verona
exit, Rogers steered the plane into the concrete turn-around in the
median.
   Boone County Police Sgt. John Johnson said fuel and a mechanic
would be brought to the plane. Barring a mechanical problem, the
plane will take off from the interstate after being checked and
refueled, he said.
   Rogers said he thinks the plane may have a leak because fuel was
spattered on the body. ``I should have had plenty of gas,'' he said.

<HEAD>Teen Suicides In Cobb Focus Of CDC Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The suicides of 14 Cobb County teen-agers in a
25-month period has triggered a study on teen suicide by the Centers
for Disease Control and the county health department.
   Dr. Virginia Mork, deputy director of the Cobb County Department
of Health, said the goal of the effort is to produce the first
detailed study of suicide based on interviews with those who survive
attempts to kill themselves.
   ``We've got this glaring problem of people killing themselves. We
want to know why,'' she said. ``Who are they? What are they like?
Are their parents middle-class? How old are they? If they are in
school, what school do they go to? What method do they choose?''
   The study, now encompassing 441 case studies of all ages,
indicates at least 900 people may attempt suicide in Cobb County
every year. The county, which borders northwest Atlanta, has about
300,000 residents.
   Fourteen adolescents 19 or younger killed themselves in Cobb
County from September 1986 to October 1988. The county's suicide
rate _ 14.7 deaths for every 100,000 people _ is almost three deaths
higher than the state average and almost two higher than the
national average.
   Dr. Patrick O'Carroll of the Atlanta-based CDC said the Cobb
study may offer insights into the rising number of suicides.
   Researchers eventually want to study 1,000 cases. Interviews with
441 patients between October 1987 and October 1988 show:
   _Only 38 of the 441 who attempted suicide took precautions to
avoid rescue, a much smaller proportion than those who succeed in
committing suicide.
   _More than 240 of the 441 took drug overdoses, while few who
succeed in committing suicide take drugs. Most use guns or hang
themselves.
   _More than 60 percent were women, but women constituted only
one-third of those who succeed.
   _About 254 of the 441 expressed an intent to commit suicide,
either in a note or conversation.
   According to the National Center for Health Statistics, suicide
rates are climbing for teens and adults. The overall national rate
has risen from 11.9 suicides for every 100,000 people in 1980 to
12.8 in 1986. The death toll has risen from 26,869 to 30,904 during
the same six-year period.

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said Tuesday
he sees his brief, four-month tenure as a platform to speak out on
the need for getting dropouts back in school and educating the
illiterate, the handicapped and the dyslexic.
   ``The basic question is how do you position America so it can
deal with the issue and how you bring it about _ we must educate
every person to their fullest potential,'' Cavazos told the Hispanic
News Media Association of Washington.
   Cavazos says he's been asked why he would leave his job as a
university president to take on the complexities and challenges of
education secretary when it's for just a few months. Sworn in Sept.
20, Cavazos is the first Hispanic member of a president's Cabinet
and serves until Jan. 20, unless renominated by the next president.
   ``I see it as an opportunity, a platform so to speak, as you
folks in Washington call it _ a window of opportunity _ to say
something, to give some leadership to the things I've been saying
all along as a university president,'' said Cavazos, who is on leave
from Texas Tech University.
   In his first speech after taking over as president of the Lubbock
university in 1980, Cavazos said he used the occasion to talk about
the dropout rate, especially among Hispanics. In Texas, he said, 45
percent of Hispanic students drop out before finishing high school,
while the rate for blacks is 32 percent and for Anglos, 30.
   ``I learned long ago that people don't necessarily listen to a
university president, and I'm not sure they listen to secretaries of
education, but we're going to speak up,'' he said.
   Principal issues, he said, include helping the highly motivated
student excel and move ahead; getting the dropouts back in school
and into the mainstream of society; teaching the illiterate how to
read; educating the handicapped to their fullest level of
independence; and helping the dyslexic overcome their learning
disability.
   ``That is the agenda of America: That you educate everyone to
their fullest potential,'' he said.
   ``If one person drops out, we're all the poorer for that
reason,'' he said.
   He said he hopes to position the Department of Education to
``start thinking about these issues ... to start thinking about the
future _ where do you want this place to go, so regardless of who is
secretary of education, the agenda is pretty well laid out.''

   The Air Force will roll out its B-2 ``Stealth''
bomber on Nov. 22, at a government-owned plant in Palmdale, Calif.,
the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Defense Department spokesman Dan Howard said he ``wouldn't be a
bit surprised'' if the Air Force limited the guest list for the
ceremony as well as the ``aspects'' _ or viewing angles _ from which
the new plane was viewed.
   Some aspects of the technology are still highly classified, he
indicated.
   Howard said the Air Force had not set a date for the plane's
first flight, but that milestone is expected to occur not long after
the public unveiling.
   The Air Force and Pentagon have previously released an artist's
drawing of the plane, showing it resembles a huge ``flying wing''
without a normal fuselage and cockpit. The bomber takes its
``Stealth'' nickname from the fact that its design and materials are
intended to keep it from being visible to radar.
   Howard said he did not expect Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
to attend the roll-out ceremony because the secretary has already
seen the plane on the assembly line. The plane is manufactured by
Northrop Corp.

   Soviet icebreakers today neared two whales
trapped in the high Arctic as rescuers prepared ``Operation
Breakthrough,'' a go-for-broke attempt to smash through an ice wall
blocking the animals' path to open seas.
   The vessels were reported about 20 miles northeast of Point
Barrow before first light in Barrow, about noon EDT, said Coast
Guard spokesman Ken Freeze in Alameda, Calif. A helicopter was being
prepared to take representatives of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the Coast guard to the ship, along
with an interpreter, Freeze said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch from Moscow, said the
larger of the two icrebreakers, the Admiral Makarov, had been slowed
by heavy ice and by fog which rduced visibility to less than 200
yards.
   Meanwhile, ice experts were trying to find a way through the
pressure ridge and rescuers were trying to coax the whales over a
shoal between them and ridge. The whales retreated from the shoal
Monday.
   Anticipating the imminent arrival of two Soviet icebreakers, the
ice specialists were taking soundings Monday of the water depth on
either side of the ridge, a jumbled mass of ice chunks about 200
yards wide and some 30 feet high.
   The skipper of a U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker assigned to act as
liaison with the Soviets and a National Weather Service analyst were
among those looking for a place where the icebreaker could punch
through the ridge.
   The California gray whales must get through the icy tangle if
they are to reach an open lead, or pathway, through the ice.
   The whales, stranded about 100 yards offshore more than two weeks
ago by shifting ice about 13 miles northeast of Barrow, were about
four miles from the ice ridge. A third whale disappeared Friday and
is presumed dead.
   ``It's discouraging,'' federal biologist David Withrow said
Monday as the mammals, apparently spooked by a shoal that has
stymied progress for three days, retreated about 800 yards. ``Why
come back here when they know it's open up there?''
   The California gray whales struggled up for air, tiring quickly
as they poked their way through large slabs of Beaufort Sea ice and
thick slush left by efforts to carve them a path to freedom.
   At one point, the 27-foot-long whale _ the smaller of the two _
rested the end of its huge snout on the edge of the ice. Blood oozed
from a raw spot on its snout, smearing the ice and staining the
water.
   Biologists called a temporary halt to opening new breathing holes
so the whales would have a chance to rest and perhaps seek the open
water on their own.
   Rescue coordinator Ron Morris of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration remained optimistic.
   ``They always regress some before they learn,'' Morris said of
the whales. ``They'll move.''
   Meanwhile, specialists determined through soundings that there is
about 40 feet of water beneath the pressure ridge, a jumbled mass of
ice chunks about 30 feet high and as wide as two football fields.
   ``There is a lot of water flowing beneath the ridge, which should
mean it will be easier (for the Soviet icebreakers) to break
through'' than had been expected, Morris said.
   The icebreakers Admiral Makarov and Vladimir Arseniev were
expected to arrive this morning. The Soviet help was requested by
the U.S. government and the environmental group Greenpeace.
   The whales must make their way through the ridge if they are to
reach a lead, or pathway, through the ice. The nearest open water is
200 miles away in the Chukchi Sea.
   Breaching the ridge won't do any good if the whales can't be
coaxed past the shoal. The animals, stranded about 100 yards
offshore more than two weeks ago by shifting ice 13 miles northeast
of Barrow, were four miles from the ridge. A third whale, which
disappeared Friday, is presumed dead.
   A shift in tactics Monday proved disappointing.
   Eskimos connected a series of breathing holes to form a single
open channel about 600 yards long. Instead of pushing the broken ice
back under the ice sheet, they used long poles to guide it toward
the rear of the slot.
   The idea was to keep the whales from heading back. Initially, it
worked. The whales swam back and forth between the shoal's edge and
the rear of the channel.
   But when the channel behind them was nearly filled, the whales
turned back.
   About 12 feet of water lies over the 125-yard-wide shoal, said
biologist Geoff Carroll. The whales have been spending most of the
time in water 17 to 25 feet deep.
   ``As it gets shallower, it feels (to the whales) like they're
beaching themselves,'' said Jim Harvey, a biologist from the
National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.
   Officials hope at least one of the Soviet icebreakers can breach
the ridge, said Rear Adm. Sigmund R. Petersen, director of NOAA's
Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle.
   Charts indicate the water at the ridge is about 30 feet deep, and
the 443-foot-long Admiral Makarov needs about 35 feet to operate,
Petersen said. The smaller Vladimir Arseniev needs about 22 feet.
   ``It does seem that the Makorov would have more trouble doing
this,'' he said. ``But they may be able to assist each other. I'm
sure that these vessels, which have operated in the Arctic for
years, have all kinds of solutions to these things.''
   Biologists have a last-ditch option: airlifting the whales to
open water. Withrow emphasized that would be a last resort because
the whales could be injured or traumatized.
   Although rescuers said they were committed to freeing the whales,
the cost of the effort continues to mount.
   Most of those involved in the attempt seem reluctant to talk
about the tab but it appears substantial _ at least $600,000 by late
Monday.

   Orders to factories for ``big ticket'' durable
goods dropped 4.1 percent in September, pulled down by sharp
declines in the volatile defense and transportation sectors, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said total orders fell $5.0 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $117.7 billion last month. The steep decline
follows a big 5.7 percent increase in August and a 7.4 percent drop
in July, the worst monthly decline in four years.
   The durable goods total, which includes manufactured goods
ranging from household appliances to huge airliners, has been
buffeted up and down in recent months by wide swings in orders for
aircraft, ships and tanks, affecting both the transportation and
military sectors.
   Orders for transportation equipment in September were down 10.2
percent to $31.2 billion, following an 18.6 percent jump in August
and a 22.5 percent plummet in July. Aircraft and shipbuilding pulled
the category down last month.
   Orders for defense goods fell 12.3 percent to $7.0 billion last
month, following a 14.7 percent rise in August and a 49.4 percent
drop in July.
   Excluding defense, orders fell 3.5 percent in September, rose 5.1
percent in August and fell 2.2 percent in July. Excluding
transportation, orders were down 1.7 percent last month, following a
1.3 percent rise and a 1.0 percent fall.
   However, the weakness was widespread in September. Electrical
machinery was down 4.1 percent, the second consecutive monthly
decline, while non-electrical machinery dropped 7.5 percent.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good
barometer for business expansion plans, fell 11.9 percent to $34.1
billion, the steepest retreat since January 1986. But, it followed
increases of 6.9 percent in August and 2.1 percent a month before
that.
   The widespread weakness fits in with economists' view that the
momentum of economic growth slowed as the third quarter was ending.
   Manufacturing, driven by strong export sales, has been one of the
strongest sectors of the economy this year. Analysts disagree over
whether the slowing in the third quarter represents the beginning of
a decline or a temporary pause.
   The only area of strength in September was in primary metals,
which includes steel. It rose 6.5 percent, following declines of 2.0
percent in August and 1.4 percent in July.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 0.8 percent last month to $116.9
billion, following a 4.2 percent rise in August.

   The Rolling Stones, the Temptations, Stevie
Wonder, Dion and Otis Redding have been elected to the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame.
   This year, the Hall of Fame also will honor three early
influences on rock 'n' roll: the blues singer Bessie Smith, the
vocal quartet the Ink Spots and the gospel group the Soul Stirrers,
of which the late Sam Cooke _ himself an icon of soul music _ was
once a member.
   Phil Spector, who had a brief career as a performer but is more
famous as a writer, producer and arranger, also is being inducted,
in a non-performing category.
   The annoucement of the latest inductees to the rock industry's
honor roll was made this week by Atlantic Records' Ahmet Ertegun,
who is chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation.
Induction ceremonies are planned in New York for Jan. 18.
   More than 150 performers, producers, writers, record executives
and broadcasters voted on nominees on the basis of contributions to,
or influence on, the course of rock 'n' roll. All nominees released
records on or before 1963.
   A permanent archive and museum for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
will be built in Cleveland.
   The Rolling Stones, the ``bad boys'' of the British rock
invasion, started out by recording American blues and soul in the
early 1960s before turning to original compositions by Mick Jagger
and Keith Richards.
   The Temptations, formed in 1961, became a top Motown Records
group in the '60s, starting its long string of single and album hits
with such Smokey Robinson songs as ``My Girl.''
   Songwriter-singer-producer Stevie Wonder, born Steveland Morris
Hardaway, was brought to Motown at 12 and billed as Little Stevie
Wonder. He had his first hit _ ``Fingertips'' _ a year later. He
went on to become a multiple Grammy winner.
   Dion, born Dion DiMucci, was one of the leading talents to emerge
from the New York vocal harmony scene of the late '50s. With Dion
and the Belmonts, he had such hits as ``I Wonder Why,'' ``Runaround
Sue'' and ``The Wanderer.''
   Otis Redding, who was inspired by Cooke, became one of the great
singers to emerge from the Stax-Volt Studio in Memphis in the early
1960s.
   His hits began with ``These Arms of Mine.'' His biggest hit
``(Sittin' on the) Dock of the Bay,'' had just been shipped to
record stores when the 26-year-old Redding died in a plane crash in
1967 that also killed three members of his band, the Bar Kays. It
earned Redding his only gold record, three months after his death.

   The government reported Monday that orders for
``big ticket'' durable goods plunged 4.1 percent in September, but
economists are reluctant to conclude that the red-hot manufacturing
boom is ending.
   The Commerce Department said total orders fell $5.0 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $117.7 billion last month, pulled down by
dramatic declines in the volatile defense and transportation sectors.
   Other categories, including machinery, computers and capital
goods purchased by businesses, also fell.
   The latest report fits in with other signs of a slowdown last
month, including the second consecutive decline in retail sales and
a drop in manufacturing employment.
   But analysts said it was too soon to declare that manufacturing,
which has driven robust economic growth this year, is slowing
significantly.
   A boom in export sales, fueled by the lower value of the dollar,
has kept factories humming. Manufacturers in turn have invested
heavily to expand the capacity of their plants, spurring the fastest
growth in capital spending since 1984.
   ``There are some cautionary notes in this report, but even so the
economy is still very strong. The manufacturing sector isn't
faltering just because orders went down one month,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York.
   He noted that unusually wide swings in orders for both
transportation equipment and military goods have pushed the overall
orders number up and down over the last four months.
   Durable goods, items expected to last three or more years,
include a wide range of manufactured items, from refrigerators and
other household appliances to large computers and battleships.
   Orders had jumped 5.7 percent in August, plummeted 7.4 percent in
July and soared 8.7 percent in June.
   Orders for transportation equipment in September were down 10.2
percent, following an 18.6 percent jump in August, while orders for
defense goods fell 12.3 percent last month, following a 14.7 percent
rise.
   Excluding defense, orders fell 3.5 percent in September.
Excluding transportation, orders were down 1.7 percent.
   The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good
barometer for business expansion plans, fell 11.9 percent. It was
the first decline since May and the steepest retreat since January
1986.
   James Annable, an economist with First National Bank of Chicago,
said the decline in capital goods orders was ``disquieting because
it suggests a weakening in the primary engine of economic growth.''
   However, he said manufacturing profits are high and factories are
using a high percentage of their capacity, suggesting that capital
goods orders will rebound in the months ahead.
   Electrical machinery also fell in September, by 4.1 percent, the
second consecutive monthly decline, while non-electrical machinery
dropped 7.5 percent.
   The only area of strength in September was in primary metals,
which includes steel. It rose 6.5 percent, following declines of 2.0
percent in August and 1.4 percent in July.
   Shipments of durable goods fell 0.8 percent in September to
$116.9 billion, following a 4.2 percent increase in August. The
backlog of unfilled orders expanded by a modest 0.2 percent to
$431.9 billion last month after three strong gains from June through
August.
   In a separate report Tuesday, the National Association of
Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes fell 2.2 percent
in September. It was only the second decline since January.

<HEAD>Basic Skills Remain Top Priority for High School Principals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teaching the three Rs _ reading, 'riting and
'rithmetic _ is still the most important goal for high school
educators, according to a survey released Tuesday that also shows
teachers increasingly are concerned about gangs and crowded
classrooms.
   ``There has been a tremendous increase in concern about basic
skills, and states are now testing like they never have before,''
said Leonard O. Pellicer of the University of South Carolina, who
compiled the study for the National Association of Secondary School
Principals.
   ``In my own view, Americans, in general, feel the schools have
not done a good enough job in basic skills to prepare (their
children) to function as literate members of society,'' Pellicer
told a news conference.
   The report, titled ``High School Leaders and Their Schools,''
summarizes the organization's 1987 survey of 1,225 high school
principals and assistant principals in 1,544 schools. It is a
follow-up to similar surveys in 1965 and 1977.
   The study indicated that the top three goals of school officials
_ teaching students basic skills, helping them develop positive
self-images, and furthering intellectual inquiry and problem solving
skills _ remained the same as in the 1977 survey.
   Teaching basic skills also was the top priority in 1965, but that
year the second and third top objectives were, respectively,
promoting development of moral and spiritual values, and promoting
an understanding of the American system.
   Today's high school principals also see a greater need to prepare
American youth ``for a changing world'' _ a goal that was fourth in
the latest survey, up from eighth in 1977.
   The other goals identified in the new survey were, in order:
promoting development of moral and spiritual values; providing
career planning and training in special entry-level job skills;
promoting understanding of the American value system; teaching
skills needed in a technological society; teaching skills for family
life; promoting physical fitness; and offering exposure to the fine
arts.
   When asked which of 27 conditions would have an impact on their
schools in the next five years, almost half (49 percent) said gang
activity would have a strong influence, followed by 39 percent who
listed increases in enrollment and 37 percent who identified youth
unemployment.
   This finding was a surprise to Pellicer and association executive
director, Scott Thomson, who noted that gang activity listed well
above drug (17 percent) and alcohol abuse (20 percent).
   ``The only interpretation I can have on that is they might see
the drug scene evolving into more of a gang scene,'' Thomson said,
noting conversations with principals in urban areas not known for
gang activity.
   Thomson said he also was surprised that, despite slight salary
increases in the last decade, the overwhelming majority (89 percent)
of those questioned said they received the most job satisfaction
from their ability to help others.
   Asked to rate a list of skills and characteristics needed by
teachers, the administrators ranked the top five as competence in
subject matter; adjusting instruction to students; interpersonal
skills with students; competence in methods; and skill in developing
positive student self-images.
   Results of the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four
percentage points.

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mauno Koivisto urged patience
for those seeking speedy reforms in the Baltic states of the Soviet
Union, newspapers reported Tuesday.
   Koivisto, speaking to reporters Monday night, refrained from
clearly supporting Baltic groups which have demanded economic
freedom from Moscow, a revival of local languages and cultures, and
a halt to immigration by ethnic Russians.
   ``What qualifications have we, who are warm and on dry land, to
advise others what they should do? It is best to exercise
patience,'' Koivisto was quoted as saying by the Ilta Sanomat daily.
   Koivisto, in an earlier television interview, was even more
cautious about developments in the Baltic republic of Estonia across
the Gulf of Finland.
   ``Finland has an official foreign policy concerning states, not
popular fronts or civic groups,'' he said.
   He denied any need for a Finnish consulate in Estonia.
Neighboring Sweden reportedly has been considering opening an
Estonian consulate.
   Finland traditionally has close but wary ties with the Soviet
Union, which occupied parts of Finland during World War II.
   But the Finns also have an affinity for Estonia, which is 50
miles across the gulf and has a similar in language. Finnish
television is viewed by many Estonians.
   Koivisto's TV interview was his first since being re-elected to a
second six-year term in February.

<TEXT>
   If all else fails and rescuers scrambling
to free two gray whales trapped by Arctic ice are forced to airlift
the mammals to freedom, a California company is ready to fashion a
custom sling.
   ``We're on call,'' said John Ortega of Ortega Sail and Canvas in
Carlsbad, Calif. ``I've already picked up the fabric. I'm ready to
go as soon as they call us.''
   Dan LeBlanc, spokesman for Sea World of San Diego, said the
National Marine Fisheries Service contacted the marine life park
seeking someone who could make a sling for an airlift.
   Dr. Marilyn Dahlheim, an oceanographer with the NMFS National
Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle, said her office sought advice
from Sea World because the marine life park has used such slings and
had the appropriate contacts to locate a manufacturer. It
recommended Ortega.
   ``The OK has not been given to start cutting the material,'' she
said. ``...We need people who have done this before. And they are
the experts. You don't re-invent the wheel when you don't have to.''
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administraiton biologists have
said hauling the trapped whales to open water would be a last
alternative because of the danger of harming the whales.
   Ortega, with 22 years experience in custom sewing and
manufacturing, said he already has designed a sling for the Alaska
whales.
   ``It's going to be flat, more like a rectangle. It's not going to
be real exotic because we don't have time to cut holes out for
fins,'' he said. ``It's going to a large, flat sling, about 30 feet
long, reinforced with metal rods. It's got to hold 12 tons.
Normally, I cut in fin holes, but this a different kind of mammal.''
   He said the finished product would look like a large stretcher
with various holes for the helicopter to pick up the sling.
   ``I've never made one this large before. The whales that Sea
World picks up are about 20 feet, these whales are longer.'' Ortega
said he has made slings for Sea World for about 10 years.
   He said he would donate his time and labor if the sling is
ordered and that it would take him and a crew of six to eight
workers about 10 hours to fashion the sling out of ballistic nylon
and webbing. Sea World is paying for the fabric.
   LeBlanc said rescue workers have talked in general terms with Sea
World about a possible airlift.
   ``At the least, we'll consult from here, and at the most, we'll
go up and do what we can,'' LeBlanc said.

into a theater showing ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' then asked
police to arrest him.
   The theater was empty and no one was injured, police said.
   Stanley Watin, 49, of Etna, was treated for chest injuries at a
hospital and later arraigned on a charge of second-degree criminal
mischief, said Ithaca Police Sgt. David Barnes. Bail was set at
$15,000.
   Barnes said the damage to Fall Creek Pictures was estensive.
   ``He got into his bus, drove into the thing (theater), flagged
down a patrol car in the neighborhood and said he wanted to be
arrested,'' said Tsvi Bokaer, the theater's owner and manager.
   Watin's bus is ``styled similar to a Greyhound'' bus, according
to Barnes, who said he had not seen the vehicle and did not know why
Watin owned it.
   Barnes said Watin told police he was upset about the film, which
has ignited protests from some Christians because Jesus is presented
as a human struggling to overcome the temptation to forsake his
destiny as Christ.

<HEAD>Congressman Doing Well Five Months After Lung Transplant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRIP DuBARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after Rep. Floyd Spence nearly died
of breathing problems, a rare transplant has given him new lungs and
a renewed shot for a 10th term in Congress.
   Five months after he underwent the double-lung transplant,
however, Spence's health remains a central issue in his re-election
campaign.
   The 60-year-old Lexington Republican faces a challenge from
Columbia banker Jim Leventis and has recently begun to step up his
campaigning.
   Spence's surgeon and colleagues say the congressman has made a
strong recovery from the sometimes-fatal operation.
   For six months, while he waited for a lung transplant after being
diagnosed with chronic obstructive lung disease, Spence moved about
in a wheelchair aided by portable oxygen. Others worried about his
future.
   ``Before his operation, he was having trouble breathing,'' said
Chuck Fant, spokesman for Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., who serves with
Spence on the Armed Services Committee. ``It was pretty obvious he
was having trouble speaking. He was wheezing and coughing a lot and
he looked bad.''
   In May, the wait ended, and doctors at the University of
Mississippi Medical Center successfully transplanted the lungs of an
18-year-old Texas motorcycle accident victim into Spence.
   Spence spent the next few months learning to walk and to hold his
head erect again, before being released July 15.
   His surgeon, Dr. Seshadri Raju of the University of Mississippi,
said Spence has successfully passed the dangerous three months
immediately after surgery and should now be OK.
   ``Right now he is brand new. Right now I think he has the outlook
of any 60-year-old who is healthy,'' Raju said.
   The Mississippi hospital where Spence received his new lungs had
performed only three double-lung transplants before Spence. Two of
the three patients have died.
   Since Spence, two more have had the operation, one of whom died,
and the other remains hospitalized, spokeswoman Janis Quinn said.
   Spence said he feels fine, although he admitted to some tiredness
and swelling in his ankles that at times inhibits walking. The
swelling is a side-effect of the anti-rejection medicine he takes.
   But he said he maintains a 12-hour work day, uses weights for
strength in his upper body and tries to walk the quarter-mile from
his office to the Capitol to increase his fitness.
   ``It's just amazing that I have accommodated myself _ my body has
_ to these new lungs like it has,'' he said. ``Of course, I've got
some tightness in my chest because I've got wire in it and
everything else,'' he said.
   Since Spence returned to Congress Sept. 14, those familiar with
him say they've seen a dramatic change.
   ``I don't think there's any problem about his health at all,''
said U.S. Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Florida, who chairs a House Armed
Services Subcommittee on which Spence is the ranking Republican.
``There are lots of people in Congress weaker than he.''
   But, indirectly, Leventis has raised the issue of Spence's
ability to perform his duties.
   Earlier this month, Leventis released a letter in which Spence's
former doctor urged the congressman to answer Leventis' call for a
debate.
   A Spence spokesman accused Dr. Robert K. Moxon of playing ``fast
and loose with the Hippocratic oath,'' but Moxon denied any
impropriety.
   ``His health has been a public issue and it sounds like they're
hiding behind it,'' he said.
   A poll of 515 district voters conducted by The State newspaper of
Columbia recently found only 30 percent thought health should be an
issue in the campaign. The poll was conducted Oct. 10-12 and
contained a 4.3 percent margin of error.
   That same poll found voters preferring Spence 52 percent to 42
percent over Leventis.
   Leventis has never directly said Spence is unable to represent
the district. He said health should never be a standard by which
public officials are elected.
   ``That's for him to judge,'' Leventis said of Spence. ``He says
he's fine and I accept that.''
   Spence, though, has accused Leventis of less than honorable
intentions in entering the race, which Leventis denies.
   ``I'm sure this one thought I was dead or going to die,'' he said
after the transplant. ``But I was still wiggling out there.''

<HEAD>Mystery Malady Kills, Blinds Pelicans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT ORANGE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wildlife officials combed Pelican Island
on Tuesday for clues to a mysterious malady that has killed more
than 100 brown pelicans and left scores of others blinded and
weakened.
   State biologists speculated that a larval parasite that attacks
the birds' eyes and head had spread among the large population on
this small island in the Halifax River south of Daytona Beach.
   Among the dead or dying birds in the mangroves on the
400-yard-long island were several snowy egrets.
   Carcasses of some dead pelicans and several sickened birds,
including a snowy egret, were being studied at the veterinary
hospital at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Officials
there said it could take days or weeks to determine a cause.
   Veterinarians and animal specialists were stunned by the deaths.
   ``It's almost like a leprosy,'' said Carol Swain, a wildlife
rehabilitator. ``It's eating away, rotting their skulls. The bone
was almost exposed.''
   ``Nobody's ever seen it like this,'' said Michele Yown, a Marine
Patrol officer.
   In efforts to prevent spread of the disease, Swain and colleagues
gave lethal injections to 38 blinded birds, which were then
cremated, on Monday.
   The sick birds are lethargic and easy to catch.
   ``You can walk right up to them,'' said Swain. ``If you can catch
it (a bird), there's something wrong with it.''
   Lt. Vernon Hitt of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission said the birds become disoriented, losing their ability
to fly or walk well. Other game officials said the birds did not
appear to have been poisoned, and they did not believe pollution was
to blame.
   No similar problems were found on neighboring small islands, most
of which are made from dredge material like Pelican Island.
   Paul Minshew, assistant director of environmental health for the
Volusia County Health Department, said it was unlikely that the
birds' disease can spread to humans.
   ``I've never heard any reports of diseases that go from pelicans
or snowy egrets to humans,'' he said. ``It appears to be very
specific to the two species.''
   The brown pelican was removed from the endangered-species list
along the Atlantic Coast in 1985, when the population swelled,
according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Donald Forrester, a University of Florida veterinarian, said
pelicans occasionally die in large numbers around the state.
   One of three things is usually to blame, Forrester said: blood in
the intestines, starvation, or an abnormally high number of stomach
worms that result when pelicans change their diet from one species
of fish to another.
   He declined to speculate about the deadly malady on Pelican
Island.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators detained 37 people Tuesday for
questioning in the arson attack on a Left Bank theater showing
Martin Scorsese's ``Last Temptation of Christ,'' police sources
said. All but seven later were released.
   The fire was the latest event in a campaign of violence aimed at
scaring spectators and driving the movie out of French cinemas.
Interior Minister Pierre Joxe called the violence ``reminiscent of
the worst moments of the Inquisition.''
   Thirteen people were injured in the Saturday night blaze at the
St. Michel theater.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
arrests came after early morning raids in the homes of people
connected to an ``extreme-right milieu.'' Police released all but
seven of those arrested Thursday night.
   They said seven people remained in custody did not elaborate.
   They were not immediately charged, and their names were not
disclosed. Under French law they can be held for questioning for 48
hours.
   Several hundred people, including government officials, religious
leaders and film directors, demonstrated in support of the film
Monday in front of the damaged cinema.
   The film opened in 17 Paris theaters on Sept. 28, but remains in
only one city cinema. A spokeswoman at UIP, the French distributor,
said the film had been running in about 30 cities before the weekend
attack, but only 10 afterward.
   Moviegoers have encountered fires, stink bombs, firebombs and
tear gas.
   ``We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by such acts,''
said Culture Minister Jack Lang.
   Roman Catholic bishops have criticized the film, but refused to
participate in public demonstrations saying they did not support
censorship.
   Traditionalist Roman Catholic groups, however, have staged
protests and urged the government to ban the movie. Some of those
groups are linked to extreme-right politicians.
   Interior Minister Joxe called those responsible for the fire
``crazy fundamentalists.''
   Several public protests to the film have been led by supporters
of Abbot Philippe Laguerie, head of the St. Nicolas du Chardonnet
parish, a stronghold of traditionalist Roman Catholic followers of
rebel Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre.
   Laguerie condemned the cinema fire but said in a sermon Sunday
that Scorsese's ``blasphemous and ignominious film'' was to blame.
   Authorities also have been criticized for not doing enough to
prevent the violence.
   In Lyon, protesters threw tear gas at moviegoers waiting to buy
tickets and assaulted the cashier and projectionist.
   In Nice, street fighting broke out between spectators and
protesters. Theaters were vandalized in Grenoble and one in Besancon
was destroyed by a firebomb. A Paris theater near the Opera was also
badly damaged by fire.
   Attendance throughout France plummeted and many theaters replaced
``Last Temptation'' with other movies.
   ``The violence definitely scared off many people,'' said
Dominique Dumont, the manager of the Quatorze Juillet-Bastille
theater, which ran the film for two weeks.
   Dumont said he searched spectators and turned away nearly a dozen
people carrying tear gas canisters.
   Roman Catholic church officials advised against seeing the movie,
which portrays Jesus Christ as having human passions, including a
dream sequence in which he makes love with prostitute Mary Magdalene.

   The American Battle Monuments Commission
launched a national design competition Tuesday for the recently
authorized Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard, who announced the competition on
behalf of the commission, said any U.S. citizen at least 18 years of
age would be eligible to submit a proposal. Interested parties must
write to the government, however, to request rules and registration
forms and be certified as a contestant by Dec. 1, he added.
   Once certified, each contestant will have until May 1 to submit
his or her design for the memorial, which is to be constructed near
the Lincoln Memorial. The site is south of the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, on the opposite side of the Reflecting Pool.
   ``The Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board, assisted by
technical advisors from various agencies, will be the jury for the
competition and will select the winning design,'' Howard said.
   According to retired Army Gen. Richard G. Stillwell, the chairman
of that 12-member advisory board, the winning designer and the
runner's up will receive cash prizes.
   Those interested in submitting a design should write to: Korean

   The Soviet Union is seeking a deal with the
Philippines to allow repair of Soviet military vessels at a shipyard
adjacent to the strategic U.S. naval base at Subic Bay, government
officials say.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said Tuesday the
United States ``would not look favorably'' on any such arrangement
because of ``the opportunities it might afford the Soviets to spy on
our activities at Subic Bay.''
   ``The Philippine government is well aware of our feelings on
that,'' he said.
   At the same time, Howard said he could not confirm that
negotiations between the Filipinos and the Soviets were taking place.
   There were conflicting reports Tuesday about the status of the
reported Soviet request. One official said a deal between the two
countries had already been signed, while another that the
Philippines was ``tempted'' by the offer but had made no decision. A
third official said there was considerable confusion about the
intentions of both the Soviets and the Philippines. All the
officials asked that their names not be used.
   The Philippines has rejected previous Soviet requests for access
to the Philseco repair yard. But economic and political factors
appear to be prompting it to reassess that position, the officials
said.
   The Philseco yard, a joint venture between Philippine and
Japanese interests, has been losing money. In addition, the new
Soviet proposal comes at a time when many Filipinos are seeking a
relationship more independent of the United States.
   But the officials said close Soviet access to Subic Bay would not
only be an intelligence-gathering bonus for Moscow but would also
enable Soviet vessels to remain longer in the region, thus enhancing
the Soviets' military capability, the officials said.
   The desire for ship repair facilities apparently reflects a major
Soviet military buildup in the Pacific in recent years. According to
the Pentagon, the Kremlin has increased the number of ships and
submarines in its Pacific fleet by 40 vessels to a total of 860
since the end of 1984.
   Approval of the Soviet proposal also would be seen as further
evidence of the Philippines' desire to dissociate itself from the
United States. A more independent Filipino stance was apparent
during recent base negotiations with the United States, which
frequently were marked by bitter acrimony.
   A week ago, the two countries signed an agreement to provide the
Philippines with $962 million in military and economic aid over the
next two years in exchange for continued U.S. access to Subic and to
Clark Air Base. They are the largest U.S. military installations
overseas.
   As a reflection of the continuing strain in relations, both the
Philippines and the United States have left open the possibility
that their 1947 base agreement will not be renewed when it expires
in 1991.
   Reaction in the Philippines to the aid agreement has been
hostile, partly because Filipino negotiators backed away from their
original demand for more than $1 billion annually in assistance.
   Still, the $481 million in annual aid agreed to for 1990 and 1991
represented a sharp increase from the $180 million the United States
had been pledging since 1983.
   As U.S. officials see it, Philippine President Corazon Aquino
could seek to placate opposition to the aid agreement by approving
the Soviet request for a ship repair deal at Philseco.

<HEAD>Teen Sentenced to Lifetime Birth Control Not Allowed on National

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who sentenced a teen-age mother to
lifetime birth control for neglect of her two young children has
denied her permission to travel to New York to appear on television.
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Lindsay Ellis Budzyn ruled
Monday that letting Debra Ann Forster, 18, go to New York next month
to appear on the Phil Donahue talk show ``would be like throwing her
into the mouths of sharks.
   ``She is not ready for it. It could hurt her and it would not be
in her best interest. She's making the kinds of rehabilitatives
strides than an interruption, with this kind of media coverage,
could disrupt.''
   The judge also was invited to appear on the Donahue show but
declined.
   Ms. Forster was sentenced in May to lifetime probation for
leaving her two small sons alone for nearly three days without food
or water in a hot Mesa apartment.
   As a condition of her probation, Ms. Forster was ordered to
remain on birth control for the remainder of her child-bearing years
and was prohibited from leaving Arizona without court approval.
   The birth control restriction was lifted as unenforceable in
August when Ms. Budzyn learned that Ms. Forster was pregnant again.
   Ms. Forster's attorney, Garrett Simpson, had asked the judge to
permit the woman to go to New York, arguing that her appearance on
the show ``would serve the public interest, would serve
rehabilitation and will enhance the reputation of the bench.''
   The judge, in refusing the request, noted that she has carefully
monitored Ms. Forster's activities and that the woman is receiving
pre-natal care, intensive counseling, is studying for her high
school diploma, is learning to cook and is staying drug-free.
   Ms. Forster was pregnant in May 1987 when she left her sons, then
7 months old and 18 months old, in her Mesa apartment. When the
boys' father found them, they were severely dehydrated and one was
near death, according to court testimony.
   The boys were taken into custody of Child Protective Services and
their mother has been barred from seeing them again.
   A daughter born while Ms. Forster was in jail awaiting resolution
of her case was immediately put up for adoption.
   Ms. Forster, who has reconciled with her husband, said that the
baby she now carries ``is the most important thing in her life,''
the judge said.
   ``She said this is the first time in her life that she has people
who care for her,'' Ms. Budzyn said. ``I felt pretty good after
talking with her.''

   A Peruvian state-owned airliner carrying about
50 passengers crashed today high in the Andes, killing at least one
person and injuring at least 25, officials said.
   But a pilots' association spokesman in Lima said four people were
killed.
   Victor Urbiola, prefect of Puno state, said Aeroperu's flight 772
from Juliaca, near the Bolivian border, to Arequipa, Peru's second
largest city, crashed about 10:45 a.m.
   Urbiola, whose position is equivalent to a governor in the United
States, said the plane went down about a mile from the airport
shortly after takeoff.
   Juliaca police said one person was killed and at least 25 people
were injured, many of them seriously.
   But a spokesman for the Association of Pilots of Aeroperu said
four people were killed. He spoke on condition of anonymity and
would not elaborate.
   Freddy Chirinos, press spokesman for Aeroperu, said the
Dutch-made Fokker aircraft has a capacity for 60 passengers but
``there were only about 50'' aboard the plane. He said he had no
information on identities or nationalities of the passengers.
   Chirinos an Aeroperu plane carrying company officials and
government investigators had left for Juliaca to determine the cause
of the crash.
   A spokesman for the Arequipa airport told The Associated Press
that the plane crashed on a broad pasture more than two miles above
sea level.
   Juliaca is located in Puno state, 540 miles southeast of Lima.
   The flight from Juliaca often carries foreign tourists from Lake
Titicaca, on the border with Bolivia.

<TEXT>
   Launch of the Hubble Space Telescope, a
powerful instrument that is expected to collect the clearest views
yet of the universe, will be moved up from February 1990 to December
1989, space agency officials said Tuesday.
   The change came as a result of a ``reassessment'' of the space
shuttle launch schedule, according to a National Aeronautics and
Space Administration announcement.
   However, Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman, said plans call for a
Defense Department shuttle flight that had been set for December
1989, to switch places in the flight schedule with the Hubble
launch, enabling the telescope to get into space two months earlier
than previously planned.
   Experts believe the telescope will be able to study stars and
galaxies more than 14 billion light years from Earth and to capture
images of the universe that are much clearer than those seen by
ground-based telescopes.
   NASA originally planned to the launch the Hubble in 1985, but the
date slipped to the fall of 1986 and then was delayed because of the
January 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
   The original development costs of the Hubble were estimated at
$435 million, but due to delays and other problems the costs through
June 1989 are now estimated at $1.5 billion.
   A space shuttle will carry the telescope into an orbit about 360
miles above the Earth. This will put it far above the atmosphere
that often obscures the view of ground-based telescopes.
   The space telescope is designed to transmit its observations to
Earth for about three years. A shuttle then would visit the
observatory to replace batteries and to make repairs if needed. The
telescope also would be boosted into a higher orbit as needed to
keep it from falling to Earth. With regular maintenance, the Hubble
is designed to operate for at least 15 years.

<TEXT>
   Stanley Friedman, the ex-Bronx Democratic boss
already serving 12 years for racketeering, was convicted Tuesday of
bribing a National Guard general to get a contract for a company in
which Friedman was the largest stockholder.
   The disgraced politician faces up to seven years in prison for
his conviction on bribery and conspiracy charges by state Supreme
Court Justice Maria Santagata, who heard the case without a jury.
   Santagata will sentence Friedman Nov. 15 on the bribery
conviction.
   Both Friedman's convictions stem from his efforts to drum up
business through bribery on behalf of CitiSource Inc., a company in
which he was the largest stockholder.
   After Santagata's ruling, Friedman attorney Gerald Shargell asked
the judge to sentence his client immediately, allowing Friedman to
end his stay at Rikers Island. Santagata declined to do so.
   Friedman had been serving time at an out-of-state federal
facility, but was moved to the city jail for the duration of his
trial, which began Sept. 19.
   In the federal case, Friedman and three co-defendants were
convicted in November 1986 for a scheme to get a $22.7 million
Parking Violations Bureau contract for hand-held computers through a
pattern of racketeering.
   In opening arguments, Assistant District Attorney Brian Rosner
charged Friedman, 51, funneled $7,500 to former Brig. Gen. Bernard
Ehrlich in July 1985 through a shell company set up by Ehrlich and
his law partner, Richard Biaggi.
   In return, Ehrlich _ former deputy commander of the state
National Guard _ pushed the state military to purchase CitiSource's
hand-held computer. State officials, at the general's urging, agreed
in 1985 to a $90,000 contract to try out the computer. National
Guard officials in Washington later rejected the contract.
   Shargell had argued that Friedman did not knowingly bribe
Ehrlich, but had instead paid him as compensation for work done in
his capacity outside the National Guard. Ehrlich had told Friedman
the payments were legitimate, Shargell said.
   Ehrlich was removed as a co-defendant in the case five days
before trial when Santagata ruled he was incompetent to stand trial.
Ehrlich, who was committed to a mental hospital by the judge, was
convicted in August of racketeering in the Wedtech case involving
ex-U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi.
   Ehrlich faces up to 135 years in prison in the Wedtech case.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Think They've Found Gate Jesus Used</HEAD>

   Archaeologists digging on the south slope of
Mount Zion believe they have found the gate through which Jesus left
Jerusalem after the Last Supper, a project leader said Tuesday.
   Volunteer researchers and students found what they believe to be
remnants of the gate last summer while excavating a site along the
walls of Jerusalem's Old City.
   ``This is more evidence that we are standing on the cradle of
Christianity,'' the Rev. Bargil Pixner, co-director of the project,
said during a tour of the site. ``It is an incredible find.''
   Ancient coins and pottery scattered near the gate prove the ruins
date to the time of Christ, said archaeologist Doron Chen of Hebrew
University.
   Members of the team said they found the gate's remains _ a broken
support column and stone blocks that formed an arch _ in a maze of
walls and towers dating as far back as 700 B.C.
   Chen said the gate, buried beneath more than 12 feet of dirt and
rock, was built in 37 B.C. and destroyed about 100 years later when
the Romans conquered Jerusalem again.
   Pixner, a priest at the Benedictine Abbey of Dormition, said the
dating and the location on the southern edge of Mount Zion match
biblical accounts of the Last Supper.
   ``It can safely be presumed that Jesus used this gate on his way
to and from the Last Supper,'' he said, pointing to the spot about
800 feet farther up Mount Zion where Christians believe Jesus met
the apostles.
   ``Everything we've found indicates that this is the place,''
Pixner declared.
   The Bible's account of the Last Supper says Jesus was staying in
nearby Bethany and told the apostles to go to Jerusalem, where a man
carrying a water pitcher would lead them to their meeting place.
   Pixner said he believes Jesus and the apostles gathered at a
guest house near where the excavators found the remnants of the
gate, which he described as about 10 feet wide and 15-20 feet high.
They have named it the Gate of Essene after a small Jewish religious
community believed to have lived in the area.
   Two British archaeologists found the wall adjacent to the gate
while tunneling about 100 years ago but did not find the gate, Chen
said.
   Pixner said the Dormition Abbey, which raised about $80,000 in
private donations for the dig, plans to open the site to visitors
when studies of it are complete.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviet Officials To Meet On Cambodia, Asia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top U.S. and Soviet officials will meet in
Paris next week on efforts to reach a settlement in Cambodia as well
as other topics of mutual concern in East Asia and the Pacific, the
State Department said Tuesday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur will confer with Soviet
Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev on Nov. 2 and 3 as part of
periodic superpower talks on regional issues, said spokesman Charles
Redman.
   ``The Cambodia issue is one of the most important'' on the
agenda, although not the only one, he added. Other topics are
expected to include the recent rapprochement between North and South
Korea.
   Before seeing Rogachev, Sigur will meet in Paris on Nov. 1 with
exiled Cambodian leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk. That session comes
one week before Sihanouk's scheduled meeting with Cambodia's Prime
Minister Hun Sen, who was installed by Vietnamese forces that occupy
his country.
   Sihanouk and Hun Sen are expected to discuss attempts to form a
coalition government composed of three opposition groups and
representatives of the government set up in Phnom Penh by Vietnam 10
years ago.
   Both the United States and the Soviet Union back such an
arrangement.
   Rogachev held talks in August with Chinese officials in Beijing
on the Cambodian question, which is one of the few remaining
obstacles to normalizing relations between Moscow and Beijing.
   China wants the Soviet Union to pressure its Vietnamese ally to
withdraw from Cambodia as soon as possible. Vietnam has agreed to
pull out all its forces by 1990.

   Police firing tear gas charged
thousands of protesters in three anti-government demonstrations
Tuesday, a day after a bomb attack killed eight people at a
governing party meeting.
   Police initially blamed Sinhalese extremists for the Monday
evening bombing in Colombo, but party officials did not rule out
that opposing political parties were behind the explosion.
   Military officials suspected Sinhalese extremists in the killings
of four people Monday night and Tuesday.
   No casualties were reported in Tuesday's demonstrations in
central and south Sri Lanka.
   The government placed an 18-hour curfew on the capital after
reports the People's Liberation Front, a radical Sinhalese group,
was planning a daylong strike. The government said it feared a
strike would lead to more violence.
   The curfew lapsed late Tuesday, and police guarded intersections
as thousands of residents went out to buy provisions.
   Violence in Sri Lanka has escalated with the approach of
presidential elections scheduled for Dec. 19.
   The People's Liberation Front opposes the government's peace
overtures to minority Tamils fighting for an independent homeland on
the north and east of the island.
   The front has been blamed for more than 500 killings since India
and Sri Lanka signed a July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the
5-year-old Tamil separatist war. Many have been politicians with the
United National Party, also predominantly Sinhalese.
   In central Welimada province, about 70 miles east of Colombo,
police fired tear gas and charged with batons into an estimated
5,000 anti-government demonstrators.
   The demonstrators sat on public highways and refused to move,
officials said. Police were unable to disperse them, officials said.
State-run television said there were no casulties.
   In the town of Medawachchiya, about 90 miles northeast of
Colombo, police were called to disperse 3,000 protesters, including
many Buddhist monks and schoolchildren, who were demanding the
government's resignation.
   In the southern Uva Paranagama province similar demonstrations
were held, but details were not immediately available.
   Police said three people were killed in the town of Welimada late
Monday by suspected members of the front. In Kandy, Sinhalese gunmen
killed a postmaster Tuesday, police said.
   Police in Colombo said the death toll in the bombing Monday rose
to eight after three more people died of their wounds Tuesday. At
least 40 others were injured, they added.
   Sinhalese extremists say the peace accord grants too many
concessions to the Tamils, who form 18 percent of the country's 16
million people.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population.
   The front has put up posters in Colombo and others parts of Sri
Lanka demanding President Junius R. Jayewardene's resignation, the
rejection of the peace accord and the withdrawal of 47,000 Indian
troops in Sri Lanka to quell the Tamil rebellion.
   The Tamils claim they were discriminated against by the
Sinhalese, who control Sri Lanka's military and government.

   A federal court jury has rejected a $6.5

liver damage from taking two Tylenol products at the same time.
   ``We're gratified at the jury's verdict,'' said Robert E.

of McNeil Consumer Products Co., which makes Tylenol.
   The U.S. District Court jury deliberated about an hour Monday
before rejecting the negligence suit filed by Silvia Jauchler, whose
husband Maurice died last year. She said labels should warn people
against taking the maximum dose of two different acetaminophen
products at the same time.
   ``We didn't cause this man's problem. We're grateful the jury
believed us,'' Christiansen said.

<HEAD>Notices Go Out Nov. 14 on 90,000 Delinquent Farm Loans Worth $8
Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farmers Home Administration will begin
sending out notices shortly after the Nov. 8 election in an effort
to collect $8.8 billion in past-due loans, the Agriculture
Department agency said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Marlyn Aycock said rules implementing new credit
legislation will take effect Nov. 14 and that ``Dear Farmer Jones''
notices will start going out soon thereafter to an estimated 90,000
delinquent FmHA borrowers.
   Aycock said the notices will say: ``This is to inform you that
you're seriously behind in your loan payments and to inform you of
your options. Farmers who are more than 180 days late in making
payments have several options.''
   The notices will explain that the FmHA borrowers must notify the
agency within 45 days if they intend to apply to make arrangements
for settling their debts. Details regarding the options, including
debt restructuring and write-offs, also will be provided.
   Congress ordered FmHA to revise its lending practices in the
Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. The agency often is called the farm
lender of last resort because it makes loans only to those who
cannot qualify at banks or other commercial sources.
   The debt write-down, or forgiveness provision, is regarded as one
of the most important parts of the 1987 law. It allows FmHA to
reduce a farmer's delinquent debt to the recovery value of the
collateral, which is usually land or farm equipment, depending on
cash flow and other factors.
   Also, as the result of lawsuits, the FmHA is under court order to
redo many of its loan regulations and to delay foreclosures and
forced liquidations until those actions are completed.
   Estimates of the extent of FmHA loan delinquencies and numbers of
farmers potentially threatened by foreclosure under the new rules
have varied.
   Last May 23, when the new regulations were proposed, FmHA losses
resulting from write-offs and other settlements were estimated at
about $8.7 billion and that about 118,000 borrowers were delinquent.
About 64,800 of those could be pushed into liquidation or
foreclosure because they couldn't qualify for help under the new law.
   Another major step was an interim rule announced on Sept. 14,
including procedures for making debt restructuring and write-downs.
Those were to take effect on Oct. 14 on an interim basis and called
for final adoption on Nov. 14 after a 60-day period for public
comments.
   In the September announcement, the earlier analysis was used
again. It referred to 118,000 delinquent borrowers, including about
65,000 who would be rejected for debt write-downs. The potential
losses were said to be as high as $9.4 billion, although about $1
billion could be salvaged by the agency.
   Aycock said the current estimate of 90,000 delinquent borrowers
was based on figures last fall, when FmHA delinquencies usually are
lower than those in January, when the 118,000 were reported.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung on
Tuesday urged President Roh Tae-woo to accelerate reforms and
recover fortunes allegedly amassed by a former leader.
   Kim, who addressed the National Assembly as head of South Korea's
main opposition party, also proposed changes in relations with the
United States that would give South Korea more independence and
check anti-U.S. sentiment.
   The leader of the Party for Peace and Democracy said the time had
come ``to open sincere discussions about the strict enforcement of
jurisdiction over U.S. troops, nuclear weapons and the transfer of
U.S. commandership over South Korean troops.''
   Under treaties signed during the 1950-53 Korean War, South Korea
has no jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers stationed in the country.
   At the Hankook University of Foreign Studies, about 100 students
armed with firebombs and rocks battled riot police on Tuesday,
demanding the withdrawl of about 42,000 U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea.
   Also on Tuesday, about 40 students staged a peaceful anti-U.S.
protest in front of the U.S. Embassy.
   A majority of South Koreans support the presence of U.S. troops,
but dissidents contend the United States has hampered reunification
of the divided peninsula.
   Kim attributed the growing anti-Americanism to nationalism
brought by rapid political and economic changes, as well as the
country's pride as the host of the Olympics.
   The opposition leader urged Roh to take a courageous stand
against former President Chun Doo-hwan, whom opponents accuse of
amassing wealth through corruption.
   During a parliamentary investigation of state affairs that began
Oct. 5, opposition lawmakers found evidence of widespread
corruption, irregularities and violation of human rights by Chun and
his followers.
   Kim charged Chun and his family with amassing hundreds of
millions of dollars during his seven years in office and demanded
the money be returned to help the poor.
   Kim also called for an end to alleged wiretapping, torture and
political surveillance of students and dissidents by police and
other security organs.
   Roh, a former general who succeeded Chun in February, is gaining
popularity with his proposed reforms and efforts to improve
relations with East bloc nations, some of whom have exchanged trade
offices with South Korea.
   Dissidents and radical students have vowed to launch a nationwide
campaign next week to press for the arrest of Chun and his family.

   Sen. Dan Quayle on Tuesday defended
GOP presidential nominee George Bush's campaign against charges of
distortion and lying, and he said the Democrats were the ones
dishing ``political sludge.''
   His remarks on a campaign swing through Georgia came about a week
after Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis called GOP
campaign literature ``political garbage.''
   Quayle said George Bush was a 25-year public servant who ``has
built a career resting on unshakable integrity and fairness.''
   ``The personal attacks now being made on him by a desperate
opponent are outrageous,'' Quayle said in a luncheon address to a
Rotary Club in Stone Mountain.
   ``The political sludge that is being dished out by Mr. Dukakis'
surrogates and which I believe the governor is actively encouraging
is despicable,'' Quayle said.
   He also accused Dukakis of shifts of position that ``tell us
something about how steady that candidate would be if elected.''
   Quayle listed issues on which the Republicans have attacked
Dukakis _ tax increases in Massachusetts, borrowing from that
state's pension fund, pollution of Boston Harbor, gun control, and
Dukakis' defense positions _ and rejected Dukakis' complaint that
his positions have been distorted.
   After Stone Mountain event, Quayle flew to Augusta, Ga., and was
to campaign Wednesday in Tampa, Miami and Fort Lauderdale in Florida.
   The foray into Florida, a state considered safely in Bush's hands
in the general election, was geared to help Rep. Connie Mack in his
GOP Senate race against Rep. Buddy McKay, GOP advisers said.
   One of the advisers brought in to oversee Quayle's campaign,
Mitch Daniels, said the strategy from now until the election is for
Quayle to keep a low profile nationally while hitting regionally
significant areas.
   Quayle, who has generally steered clear of major cities, will
continue making campaign appearances in rural or suburban
communities where the visit of a candidate is a big deal, Daniels
said.
   ``He's very effective in midsize and smaller communities,''
Daniels said, adding that if Quayle can make an impact on 5,000 to
10,000 votes at a given appearance, with ``a few days in a row of
that you can swing a state like Ohio.''
   Marilyn Quayle, according to her husband, phoned to tell him,
``You must be making great speeches, drawing tremendous crowds,
really getting them on their feet and saying all the right things
... because I haven't heard one thing about you this week.'
   That, said Quayle, is the ``typical role of the vice presidential
candidate and we're glad to fill that role.''
   The senator has seemed to settle into a pattern of ease in his
campaign that contrasts with the restrained style he showed early on.
   Quayle and his advisers say that his selection by Bush eventually
will be seen as having little impact on the outcome of the election.
   There are some voters who have a negative reaction to him and
feel he is not qualified, but other voters may be drawn by his youth
and conservatism, Daniels said.

   Spain's industry and energy minister, Claudi Aranzadi, and
Iranian Energy Minister Bijan Namdar Anganeh met in Tehran on Monday
and agreed to a joint project to reconstruct two power plants,
according to the agency.
   The two countries also will construct a cement factory in the

said.
   Spain did not participate in various sanctions imposed on Iran

   Most set up communities in South Africa, but Trichardt and 52

   The monument was built in the 1960s when Mozambique was a

maintained good relations with African tribal chiefs.
   ``We can find peaceful solutions to our problems, concentrating
on matters that bind us together,'' Botha said.

   A remote-controlled car bomb exploded
Tuesday in the in the Bekaa Valley as a Syrian armored personnel
carrier was passing, injuring 10 Syrian soldiers and five Lebanese
civilians, police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the 1:30 p.m. blast outside a
grocery store in the Syrian-policed town of Barr Elias, the 16th car
bombing in Lebanon this year.
   The car was packed with 88 pounds of explosives when it blew up
in the town about 30 miles southeast of Beirut, said a police
spokesman reached by telephone in Zahle, provincial capital of the
Bekaa.
   ``It was detonated by remote control as the (Syrian vehicle) was
rolling past the grocery. But it seems the vehicle and its occupants
escaped unharmed,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Initial reports only mentioned the civilian casualties, but a
police statement later reported the 10 Syrians wounded.
   The injured were taken by ambulances to a Zahle hospital.
   The Voice of the Nation radio station said Syrian troops cordoned
off Barr Elias for an hour after the blast.
   The town has a predominantly Sunni Moslem population of 30,000.
   Syria maintains an estimated 40,000 soldiers in the eastern and
northern provinces as well as Moslem west Beirut.
   The force is supported by Lebanon's Moslems and leftists, and
violently opposed by right-wing Christians who regard the Syrians an
occupying power.
   By police count, 104 people were killed and 378 wounded in 15
previous car bombings in Lebanon since April 23.

   A black cat has turned up 10 miles from home nearly
three years after it disappeared.
   ``It's like he has been resurrected,'' Eleanor Kilgore said
Monday. ``This is one cat that really has nine lives, I guess.''
   A telephone call from a woman across town Sunday afternoon sent
Ms. Kilgore racing over to see if the animal wearing her cat's worn
leather collar and metal identification tag was really her lost cat,
Winston.
   ``I hopped in the car, with tears streaming down my face,'' Ms.
Kilgore said.
   The woman who found the cat said Winston emitted a meow of relief
as Ms. Kilgore picked him up for the first time since Feb. 16, 1986.
   ``I think he was as surprised and happy to see me as I was to see
him,'' Ms. Kilgore said.
   She said Winston looks no worse for wear and still weighs about
14 pounds and has a shiny, bushy coat, but he has a few white hairs.
   Sandy Odean said she and her family had been feeding the black
cat since they moved into their home in July. She had not been able
until Sunday to get close enough to the skittish cat to read its tag.
   Ms. Odean said she called Ms. Kilgore and asked, ``Do you own a
big black cat with yellow eyes?''
   It took a few seconds for the question to register, Ms. Kilgore
said.
   ``Then I realized it couldn't be anybody but Winston,'' she said.

wedding knot with Billie Mueller Saturday night in the middle of
lanes 11 and 12.
   ``This is what I do,'' said Lowther, 32, waving his hand about
the alley where he has bowled since the age of 5.
   ``I shot a 300 on 11 and 12 and that's where I'm going to get
married. I feel it's lucky,'' he said prior to the 5-minute ceremony.
   Ms. Mueller admitted the wedding spot was ``different _ something
unusual.''
   ``He bowled his 300 there. He got lucky that one time. We felt it
would be lucky for us,'' she said.
   About 50 people were on hand to watch the ceremony, including
Lowther's new mother-in-law, Charlene Schwanke of Ames.
   ``I'm just glad he isn't a sky diver,'' Mrs. Schwanke said.

   President Reagan has signed legislation
designed to help protect the Antietam Civil War battlefield in
northern Maryland, the White House announced on Tuesday.
   The measure gives the government the authority to purchase lands
within the existing boundaries of the battlefield that have historic
or scenic value.
   The Antietam National Battlefield was established in Aug. 30,
1890, to commemorate the Sept. 17, 1862, confrontation that occurred
within an 8,000-acre area of Washington County, Md.
   Currently, the battlefield site consists of 3,246 acres. Prior to
the bill signing, the government was limited to acquiring 600 acres
within the battlefield's boundary.

<HEAD>Panel Objects To Plan To Mothball Three Mile Island Next Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 10 years after the Three Mile Island
nuclear accident in Pennsylvania, a panel of citizens and scientists
said Tuesday that the contaminated reactor should not be mothballed
next year as planned because the cleanup is not finished.
   But a spokesman for the power plant's operator said TMI managers
hoped to go ahead with the plan to place the cripped Unit 2 reactor
into ``monitored storage'' by the end of 1989.
   Under the plan, the reactor building would be locked, unneeded
systems deactivated and the plant would sit for perhaps 30 years
while radiation decays inside. Although the damaged nuclear nuclear
fuel and loose radioactive components would have been removed from
the plant, radiation would remain in piping and other areas of the
reactor building basement.
   The Advisory Panel for the Decontamination of Unit 2 told the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission at a meeting Tuesday that nine of its
11 members had sided against the so-called Post Defueling Monitored
Storage plan, known as PDMS.
   Arthur E. Morris, the panel's chairman and mayor of Lancaster,
Pa., said many in the group felt the plan was too vague.
   With no specific funding in place, Morris said there were
concerns that the cleanup of the plant might not be completed, even
after the storage phase ended. In addition, he said, area residents
were troubled by the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how many
years the reactor would sit idle until it was decommissioned.
   ``The utility seems to have looked at this PDMS as a given, and
sort of expected us to go along with it,'' said Joel Roth, a panel
member from Elizabethville, Pa.
   ``It just seems it's so wide open and the public is concerned. Is
it going to be 20 years, 40 years? It seems like there is such a
loophole, a loophole large enough for a cooling tower to pass
through,'' Roth said.
   Unit 2 was disabled in the nation's worst commercial nuclear
accident on March 31, 1979. The reactor was allowed to lose vital
cooling water that normally covers it. The subsequent $1 billion
cleanup has focused on water decontamination, waste shipment and
removal of fuel from the damaged core.
   Doug Bedell, a spokesman for GPU Nuclear, the plant operator,
said in an interview after Tuesday's meeting that the cleanup would
likely stop at the end of next year. He said it was pointless to
expose cleanup workers to additional risk after that because
remaining radiation would be ``fixed in place,'' presenting no
threat to the public.
   Bedell said the utility envisioned letting Unit 2 sit idle until
after its twin, Unit 1, ended its service life in about the year
2010. Then, both units would be dismantled together.
   GPU Nuclear would need an amendment to its NRC license before it
could proceed with its storage plan. The decision on whether to
grant the change would be made by the NRC staff, although it is
possible the commissioners themselves would get involved.

<HEAD>Kohl Says `Hard' Talks with Gorbachev, Clash on Berlin
Reunification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Tuesday he
and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev failed to agree on whether to
reunify Berlin, but signed accords to help the sick Soviet food
industry and put a West German in space.
   The chancellor earlier highlighted his concern for human rights
by meeting with Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate
at the West German ambassador's residence.
   Kohl, speaking to reporters before a second round of talks with
Gorbachev, took a philosophical view to the dispute over Berlin that
surfaced in banquet speeches the night before.
   ``The last word of history is neither spoken by me or by Mr.
Gorbachev,'' Kohl said.
   In a dinner speech, Gorbachev had said of the Berlin dispute:
   ``The attempts to upset what has been created in the (postwar)
process or push through unrealistic policies is an unpredictable and
even dangerous business.''
   He appeared to be referring to Kohl's proposal for a change in
the status of Berlin and closer relations between NATO member West
Germany and Moscow-aligned East Germany.
   Since the end of World War II, West Berlin has been under the
control of the United States, France and Britain, the victorious
allies. The city has been divided since 1961 by a wall that
symbolizes the East-West hostility of the Cold War. Kohl said in a
radio interview in January ``there can be no real improvement in
relations between Moscow and Bonn if Berlin is not included.''
   On Tuesday, Kohl told reporters he was not surprised by
Gorbachev's remarks on Berlin.
   ``The world can't be changed in a couple of hours,'' he said,
adding that he was optimistic agreement eventually could be reached.
   Kohl said Monday's talks had been ``often and in part hard.''
   The two met again Tuesday, but a Tass news agency dispatch on the
session did not say whether they discussed the Berlin dispute.
   Tass said aides signed agreements, including one on the peaceful
uses of outer space. It said the pact provides for the possibility
that a West German would fly aboard the Soviet Union's orbiting
space station, Mir. West German officials said the pact also could
have German astronauts join Soviets in traveling to Mars in 1994.
   West Germans have traveled to space in 1983 and 1985 aboard the
U.S. space shuttle.
   During recent visits by Austrian and Italian leaders, the Soviet
Union invited citizens of those countries to fly aboard the Mir
station. Next month, French President Francois Mitterrand is to
observe the launch of a French-Soviet space crew to the station.
   Another agreement signed Tuesday calls for West German companies
to help modernize about 200 Soviet food and consumer goods
factories, Tass reported. The Kremlin, faced with growing
complaints, has placed priority on eliminating food and consumer
goods shortages.
   Kohl met earlier Tuesday with Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
to discuss economic cooperation, which includes a $1.6 billion
German credit to the Kremlin to finance exports in food, leather,
textile and clothing.
   Sakharov, the founding father of the 1970s Soviet dissident
movement told Kohl there still are political prisoners in the Soviet
Union and they must be released and rehabilitated, according to
German spokesman Friedhelm Ost.
   Sakharov was banished to the closed city of Gorky in 1980 for
criticizing the Kremlin's military push into Afghanistan. Gorbachev
allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986.
   Kohl, who arrived in Moscow on a four-day visit Monday, paid
homage Tuesday to Soviet and German victims of World War II. In
freezing weather and under an gray sky, Kohl laid a wreath at the
Soviet Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beside the Kremlin wall. The
ceremony, a protocol must for foreign dignitaries visiting Moscow,
takes on a special poignancy when performed by a German.
   ``The distinguished guest honored by a minute of silence the
memory of millions of Soviet people who died in the Great Patriotic
War of 1941-45,'' Tass said in a brief report.
   An unknown Soviet soldier killed in 1941 when the Werhmacht was
at the gates of Moscow is buried in the tomb, which is topped by an
eternal flame. Total Soviet losses in World War II are officially
put at 20 million, but some Soviet historians suggest that figure is
far too low.
   Kohl then was driven to a walled cemetery in the Moscow district
of Lyublino, where 596 German soldiers who were taken prisoner by
the Red Army during World War II and later died in captivity are
buried.
   On a dark granite obelisk at the cemetery's entrance, the words
``for peace and reconcilation'' are carved in Russian. Prior to
Kohl's arrival, a solitary flower had been placed on each German
soldier's grave in the front row.
   Kohl laid a wreath and walked between the graves, whose stone
border had been freshly painted white.

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviet Negotiators Call For Halt To Overfishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top state department official said Tuesday he
was encouraged by the outcome of talks in Moscow last week in which
Soviet and U.S. officials recommended that ``immediate measures'' be
taken to halt overfishing for pollock in the Bering Sea.
   Ed Wolfe, the department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries
who led the U.S. delegation, also said that both countries are
``increasingly concerned'' about reports of possible illegal salmon
fishing by the Japanese and the Taiwanese in the North Pacific and
agreed to cooperate in enforcement activities.
   ``The Soviets are equally as concerned about possible illegal
salmon fishing as we are,'' Wolfe said in an interview. ``All of
these things are related because they all deal with Bering Sea
fishing.''
   Wolfe said he was ``quite satisfied'' with the Moscow talks and
he expected a plan for managing pollock stocks in the Bering Sea to
emerge from another round of talks either late this year or in early
1989.
   In a joint statement, negotiators meeting in Moscow said
scientists from both countries agreed that unregulated fishing was
``clearly detrimental'' to pollock stocks in U.S. and Soviet zones
that surround the international portion of the Bering Sea.
   ``In light of the urgent nature of this problem, the two
delegations agreed that ... immediate measures are necessary to
conserve fishery resources throughout the Bering Sea ecosystem,''
the statement said.
   The statement gave no indication what measures the two countries
might consider to halt the overfishing, but simply said, ``It is
essential that all countries fishing in the central Bering Sea meet
their obligations under international law to conserve these
threatened fishery resources.''
   Some State Department officials have said one possibility is for
the United States and Soviet Union to declare a moratorium on
fishing in the ``doughnut hole'' _ a 45,000-square-mile area of
international waters in the middle of the Bering Sea.
   Fishing vessels must pass through U.S. and Soviet waters to enter
the ``doughnut hole,'' one of the richest fishing grounds in the
world.
   Wolfe will be in Tokyo next week for talks with Japanese about
Bering Sea fishing.
   ``We need to see if we can turn things around,'' said Wolfe.
   Relations between Japan and the United States over fisheries
issues have deteriorated since January when seven Japanese trawlers
were videotaped fishing illegally in U.S. waters off Alaska.
   American fishermen say the annual catch of groundfish in the
``doughnut hole'' has grown from about 200,000 metric tons to more
than 1 million metric tons over the past four years.
   They also claim foreign trawlers use the ``doughnut hole'' as a
staging ground for illegal fishing forays into the 200-mile American
zone under cover of darkness or in bad weather.

   President Augusto Pinochet on Tuesday
compared his referendum defeat to the spurning of Christ, and an
opposition leader said he was ``abusing the people's patience'' by
refusing calls for democratic reform.
   In a speech to about 3,000 women volunteers, a solemn Pinochet
declared: ``We were defeated in a plebiscite, defeated but not
vanquished.''
   ``Don't forget that in world history there was a plebiscite in
which the people chose between Christ and Barabbas. And the people
chose Barabbas,'' the general said.
   ``The people sometimes make mistakes,'' Pinochet added. According
to the Bible, the Romans offered to set free either Christ or
Barabbas, a common criminal, just before their crucifixion. The
crowd chose Barabbas.
   The audience _ a private woman's organization headed by
Pinochet's wife, Lucia _ applauded loudly.
   On Oct. 5, voters rejected a proposal by the country's military
commanders that Pinochet, who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup,
remain president until 1997.
   As a result he was obliged to call an open election, planned for
December 1989, and hand power over to the winner in March 1990.
   ``We are going to keep working until the last day,'' Pinochet
vowed in his speech, ``and then hand over the government to whom you
yourselves elect.''
   Opposition groups have called for Pinochet to step down early,
and to agree to talks on reforming the 8-year-old constitution that
was drafted and pushed through by his administration. They maintain
that changes are needed to give future elected government full
democratic powers.
   Pinochet has vowed to keep the constitution intact, and Patricio
Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian Democratic Party, on
Tuesday accused the 72-year-old authoritarian ruler of trying to
provoke disorders by his intransigence.
   Aylwin said Pinochet want to ``push people into taking to the
streets, to create a pretext for unleashing violence and
repression.''
   ``He is abusing the people's patience,'' Aylwin said.
   Aylwin, a 69-year-old lawyer, is widely expected to be nominated
for president by a 16-party opposition coalition that led the
campaign for Pinochet's defeat in the referendum. His party is the
country's largest.
   The coalition has avoided calling street demonstrations or other
provocative actions, fearing they could lead to a harder government
line and hurt chances for talks on the reforms. But Aylwin said
opposition leaders, who have been calling for patience among the
ranks, ``will lose their credibility if things don't advance.''
   He said a Cabinet shakeup by Pinochet last week, in which a
U.S.-trained economist, Carlos Caceres, was named to head the
powerful Interior Ministry, did not reveal ``any readiness to
respond to the opposition parties' calls for a dialog.''
   Aylwin also complained the government had failed to heed appeals
for ``goodwill gestures'' such as the release of two labor leaders
in internal exile.

   Several gay rights advocates were dragged from
the District of Columbia Council chambers Tuesday after protesting a
bill that would allow insurance companies to require AIDS testing of
applicants for health insurance.
   ``Just say no to the rule changes,'' eight protesters chanted,
referring to congressional amendments attached to the city's $3.2
billion spending package for the fiscal year which began Oct. 1.
   ``You're not in the chamber of the legislature that caused the
problem,'' council chairman David Clarke said in appealing for
order. After the protesters refused to honor Clarke's request that
they allow the council session to continue, they were dragged from
the chamber by city police officers. None was arrested.
   ``It is the belief of many in the gay community that the German
people took a number of small steps back to Hell as Hitler came to
power,'' said Gerald Green, who organized the protest. ``We are here
to remind everyone that the council is now doing the same thing by
doing what Congress ordered.''
   Washington's gay community is upset over several amendments
attached to the city's spending bill by Congress.
   One amendment orders the city to change its human rights law to
allow Catholic universities to deny certain rights to homosexual
student groups, while another requires the city to allow insurance
companies to conduct tests for the AIDS virus on all persons seeking
insurance policies.
   In both cases, Congress would freeze all local funds and the $539
million in federal money the city receives in lieu of tax payments
on government-owned buildings if the amendments are not acted upon.

   The Rolling Stones, the Temptations, Stevie
Wonder, Dion and Otis Redding have been elected to the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame.
   This year, the Hall of Fame also will honor three early
influences on rock 'n' roll: the blues singer Bessie Smith, the
vocal quartet the Ink Spots and the gospel group the Soul Stirrers,
of which the late Sam Cooke _ himself an icon of soul music _ was
once a member.
   The Rolling Stones, the ``bad boys'' of the British rock
invasion, began by recording American blues and soul in the early
1960s before turning to original compositions by Mick Jagger and
Keith Richards.
   The Temptations, famous for ``My Girl,'' and Stevie Wonder, a
child star, both recorded for Motown Records.
   Dion was one of the leading talents to emerge from the New York
vocal harmony scene of the late '50s and Otis Redding, who was
inspired by Cooke, became one of the great singers to emerge from
the Stax-Volt Studio in Memphis in the early 1960s.
   The annoucement of the latest inductees to the rock industry's
honor roll was made this week by Atlantic Records' Ahmet Ertegun,
who is chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation.
Induction ceremonies are planned in New York for Jan. 18.

   He ate hamburgers with Marilyn Monroe and

title of singer Mel Torme's just-out autobiography.
   Torme, known to earlier generations of jazz aficionados as the
Velvet Fog, is now enjoying a new audience he refers to as ``a gang
of yuppies'' who've learned about him through appearances on TV's
``Night Court.''
   On the musical scene he was pals with the likes of Benny Goodman,
Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and others.
   ``We began to meet late at night,'' he wrote of Monroe, following
the actress' divorce in the 1950s from baseball great Joe DiMaggio.
``She loved Dolores' Drive-In for hamburgers. Several nights we sat
in my car, eating those tasty burgers and talking _ about
everything. ... We went to the movies. A few times we met at the
home of a friend. ... She told me she liked me because I made her

   Of his tiff with Gardner, he said when he asked the actress why
she was in a slinky black dress, she replied: ``I was at the studio

Maxwell in the commissary.'' It was Maxwell, Torme had escorted to a

   Despite a housing boom in California, sales of
existing homes fell 2.2 percent in September after a surprisingly
strong summer, a real estate trade group said Tuesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes
declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units
last month, following a 2.2 percent increase in August.
   But last month's level was still higher than most economists
would have predicted this spring, when mortgage interest rates began
to creep higher.
   Fixed-rate mortgages on average hit a low of 9.84 percent in
February and rose to 10.71 percent by early August. Since then, they
have eased back to 10.28 percent, but many analysts expect them to
start rising again by year's end.
   Existing-home sales in the late spring and early summer were
strong, in part because many buyers apparently purchased homes
sooner than planned in an attempt to beat rising interest rates.
   ``The decline ... in September is a hangover from the buying
spree of the summer,'' said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist of the
Realtors. ``The extraordinary increase'' of the summer was ``in part
borrowed from September.''
   Tuccillo predicted sales rates will continue to lag in the fourth
quarter and by year's end would total 3.47 million units, down only
slightly from 3.53 million in 1987.
   The West was the only region of the nation showing an increase of
sales last month. They rose 6.0 percent to an annual rate of 710,000
units, the highest level since December 1986, following a 3.1
percent increase in August.
   Sales fell 5.8 percent in the Northeast to 650,000 units on an
annual basis, the lowest since January. They fell 3.2 percent in the
Midwest to 900,000 units and were off 2.8 percent in the South to
1.38 million units.
   John Savacool, an economist with The Wefa Group, a forecasting
firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said California's strong economy and
growing population are supporting the housing market.
   ``People have been moving into California in droves, and that
provides a lot of support for the housing market there even though
the rest of the nation looks weak,'' Savacool said. He noted that
400,000 people moved to California last year, more than to any other
state.
   The main reason for sluggish sales in the Northeast is high
prices, he said.
   Over the past year, existing-home prices have risen most steeply
in the West. The median was $124,300 in September, up 7.1 percent.
   However, the Northeast remained the most costly area with a
median of $141,400, up 6.3 percent from a year earlier.
   The median in the South was $82,400, up 3.6 percent from
September 1987. In the Midwest, the price was $67,100, up 1.5
percent. The national appreciation rate over 12 months was 3.5
percent to a median of $88,500, meaning half of the homes sold for
more and half for less.

<HEAD>47 New Heart Drugs In Works</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
said Tuesday that 47 of its members companies are working on a total
of 87 new drugs for cardiovascular diseases, including heart
disease, hypertension and stroke.
   ``No other disease is targeted by so many drugs in development or
so much investment in research,'' said association president Gerald
J. Mossinghoff.
   Each of the 87 drugs is either in human clinical trials or
awaiting final approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
   He acknowledged at a news conference that one of the reasons the
companies are pouring so much investment into cardiovascular
diseases is that there remains a huge market for such therapies even
though doctors now realize they are among the most preventable
illnesses for people who adopt healthy lifestyles in their early and
middle years.
   Dr. John F. Beary III, senior vice president for science and
technology for the trade association, noted that heart disease
remains the nation's No. 1 killer and stroke No. 3.
   Even though the population is generally healthier, as well as
older, than in years past, Beary said, ``At some point these
diseases catch up with everyone.''
   The PMA survey of its more than 100 members was designed to
provide an overview of the scope of new drug development in various
categories, rather than highlight any particularly promising
``breakthrough'' drugs.
   In fact, there are already a number of drugs on the market for
cardiovascular diseases _ unlike for many other diseases that
afflict mostly the elderly, such as Alzheimer's.
   Mossinghoff acknowledged that ``a subliminal purpose (for the
press conference) is to let elder Americans know that it is
important for the FDA to have adequate funding'' to review these new
drugs.
   ``This puts a little bit of pressure on the system,'' he said.
   Mossinghoff said it is likely some of the companies developing
new cardiovascular disease drugs will take advantage of new FDA
guidelines announced last week that holds out the prospect of
quicker approval of new drugs if companies work closely with the
agency in early clinical trials and make a larger research
investment to accumulate more test data earlier than is often the
current practice.
   The trade association plans similar surveys in December for
cancer drugs under development and in January for arthritis,
Alzheimer's and other aging diseases.
   The cardiovascular disease survey found more medicines being
developed for hypertension, or high blood pressure, than any other
condition with all but three of the 38 drugs in that category in the
final stages of testing.
   The PMA said the second largest category is congestive heart
failure, the final and often fatal phase of heart disease, with 28
drugs under development.

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis,
who attempted to use his power as governor of Massachusetts to block
a National Guard training mission in Central America, lost an appeal
Tuesday challenging federal authority over the guard.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a one-sentence order
affirming a decision by U.S. District Judge Robert Keeton on May 6
that upheld federal supremacy over the guard.
   ``Having examined the briefs of the parties ... and having had
the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the judgment on the basis
stated in the district court's well-reasoned opinion,'' the appeals
court said.
   Dukakis filed suit in January to block the assignment of 13
public relations specialists in the Massachusetts Guard to Honduras
and Panama for two weeks in May because of his opposition to Reagan
administration policies in the region.
   Dukakis has denounced during his presidential campaign the
administration for its ``failed and illegal'' policy of supporting
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. He said sending National Guard troops
to the region was an attempt to intimidate Nicaragua.
   Dukakis, who was campaigning Tuesday in California and Colorado,
had no immediate comment on the decision.
   After Keeton issued his ruling in May, Dukakis appealed but he
did not try to stop the Massachusetts troops from participating in
the road-building exercises.
   Keeton's decision upheld the constitutionality of the Montgomery
Amendment, a 1986 act of Congress that says governors may not
decline such assignments ``because of any objection to the location,
purpose, type or schedule of such activity.''
   The U.S. Justice Department described Dukakis' position as ``a
dagger aimed at the heart of national defense.''
   The Massachusetts' attorney general's office had claimed that the
``Militia Clause'' of the Constitution reserved power to the
governors over training militia.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, joined by Massachusetts and nine
other states, challenged the law last year in U.S. District Court in
St. Paul and lost. That case is now on appeal.

<HEAD>Perez de Cuellar Invites Iran, Iraq to Resume Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
on Tuesday invited Iran and Iraq to resume their peace talks, and
members of the Security Council called on the nations to be more
cooperative in the new talks.
   Perez de Cuellar said his invitation to resume talks on Monday in
Geneva has been sent, but it was too early for a reply. Officials of
both countries had expressed their willingness to resume talks
before the end of the month in Geneva.
   Perez de Cuellar gave the members of the council a report Tuesday
that brought out the urgency of a rapid troop withdrawal from the
Iran-Iraq border, said the council's president, Alexander Count York
von Wartenburg.
   The 15 Security Council members unanimously adopted a statement
expressing their concern over the slow pace of the talks in
September and early October, he said.
   The members ``express their expectation that substantive progress
will be made in Geneva in order to achieve a full and rapid
implementation of Resolution 598 as an integral whole,'' said von
Wartenburg, referring to the council's peace plan.
   Observers interpreted the stress on implementing Resolution 598
as an ``integral whole'' as pressure on Iraq to give up its
insistence that the Shatt-al-Arab waterway that form the southern
border between the two nations must be cleared before the peace
talks take up other issues.
   The waterway is Iraq's only navigable outlet to the Persian Gulf,
but it has been clogged with sunken ships and silt since the war
broke out in 1980.
   Perez de Cuellar said that he and his special mediator for the
talks, Swedish Ambassador Jan K. Eliasson, will go to Geneva, but
the secretary-general expects to stay only for four or five days.
   ``I am encouraged by the fact that both sides appear ready to
show their goodwill by proceeding with some repatraition (of
prisoners of war) in the near future,'' he said.
   Iraq has suggested that all POWs could be sent home as a
humanitarian gesture outside of the peace negotiations.
   Iran said the POW issue is one of the terms of the resolution and
cannot be separated from it, but Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar
Mahallati said last week his country is ready to reciprocate
humanitarian gestures.
   Mahallati suggested that sick and injured prisoners and those
held the longest might be the first to be repatriated.
   Iranian and Iraqi sources have said both sides have accepted a
compromise from the secretary-general to break the stalemate over
the Shatt-al-Arab by postponing discussions of the issue until a
later stage of the talks.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said Iran
has accepted Iraq's demand to stop searching ships for war material
bound for Iraq.
   The compromises would allow both sides to concentrate on
negotiating the withdrawal of their troops to an internationally
recognized border and the repatriation of POWs.
   Iran has not stopped any ships since Aug. 20, the day the
U.N.-mediated cease-fire began.

   A fire-warning light forced an
American Airlines jetliner to make an emergency landing shortly
after takeoff, and the 277 people aboard evacuated by inflatable
slides, the airline said Tuesday.
   Four passengers were slightly injured while evacuating during the
incident Monday evening, said Sixto A. Nieves, the airline's
reservations supervisor in San Juan.
   Flight 688 to New York returned to San Juan's Luis Munoz Marin
International Airport minutes after takeoff when the pilot noticed a
blinking light denoting a fire in the right engine, Nieves said.
   It was later determined the warning light was faulty and there
was no fire, the official said. Federal regulations required the
plane to be evacuated by the inflatable chutes, he added.
   One passenger injured a finger and three others were bruised
sliding down the chutes, Nieves said. They were treated at a
hospital and released.
   The flight was resumed Monday night after the airplane was
checked, Nieves said.

<HEAD>Black Harvard Faculty, Administrators Call For Greater Affirmative
Action</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harvard University cannot foster the ideal of
racial equality given the underrepresentation of blacks among its
faculty and administrators, says a report issued Tuesday by an
organization of black staffers.
   Blacks make up 3 percent of the Ivy League school's instructors
and administrators, and the Association of Black Faculty and
Administrators called for increasing that figure to 10 percent.
   ``The challenge of overcoming the attachment to the beliefs and
benefits of white supremacy remains,'' the association said in its
report.
   The authors of the paper, titled ``The Final Report,'' used an
unusual story-telling technique, hypothesizing what would happen if
Harvard President Derek Bok and all of the school's black faculty
and administrators were killed in an explosion.
   The outpouring of sympathy, they concluded, would mean that
Harvard ``would adopt a much more effective program for recruiting
blacks to the school than now exists.''
   Lawrence Watson, assistant dean of the Harvard Graduate School of
Design and an association co-chair, said framing the report this way
was intended to dramatize the group's message.
   ``The use of stories to make a point is a well-known African
tradition, one that is increasingly used as a medium for scholarly
discourse,'' Watson said. ``It is our hope that the report's unusual
character will prevent its becoming another forgotten report on
affirmative action, a subject about which much more has been written
than accomplished.''
   The association said 17 of Harvard's present 957 tenured faculty,
or 1.8 percent, are black. Twenty-six of the 2,265 tenure-line
faculty, or 1.1. percent, are black, and 155 of 3,205
administrators, or 4.8 percent, are black, it said.
   In the imaginary scenario, an unnamed president would increase
minority hiring by vigorous effort and, when those positions could
not be filled, fund fellowships to help promising black students
gain the credentials to teach at Harvard or other elite schools.
   ``We view this report as an incentive for a more detailed
discussion and review with the deans of the university's 1988
Affirmative Action Plan,'' said association co-chair Derrick Bell, a
Harvard Law School professor.
   In noting that release of ``The Final Report'' comes 100 years
after black educator and historian W.E.B. Du Bois' admission to
Harvard College, the association said blacks still face prejudice at
Harvard.
   ``The association's report noted that today, Dr. Du Bois would
find a substantial number of black students at Harvard. Most are
spared the overt hostility that barred Du Bois from every social
activity except the philosophy club.
   ``Even so, contemporary black students encounter color-based
discrimination in many subtle and debilitating forms, and they
suffer the no-less hurtful slights and disparaging assumptions about
their abilities that Du Bois endured,'' it said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new 45-page handbook governing Boston's bustling
nightclubs has been adopted by the city's Licensing Board, with
provisions including bans on discriminatory admission practices and
display of ``improper'' material.
   While some of the rules are good ideas, the restriction about
what can be displayed could interfere with owners' rights to free
expression, one civil liberties advocate said.
   Boston's bustling and sometimes rowdy night scene prompted
officials to draw up the compilation of rules and regulations,
Licensing Board Chairwoman Andrea Gargiulo said Tuesday.
   The handbook, which clubs will be required to show to patrons on
request, is easier to read than the fine print regulations on
individual licenses issued to owners and will fit into police
officers' pockets, Ms. Gargiulo said.
   The new rules prohibit signs such as ``Proper Dress Required,'' a
vague stipulation that sometimes led to selective discrimination,
Ms. Gargiulo said.
   Also banned are VIP passes on any basis that ``invidiously
discriminates.''
   ``We had cases where a white male with no tie was allowed in and
a black male was told at the door that he couldn't come in without a
tie,'' Ms. Gargiulo said. ``We don't want to leave it up to the
doorman.''
   New signs will have to spell out what constitutes proper dress,
such as jacket and tie required for men, she said.
   Other new rules require that bouncers not strike customers unless
hit first and makes nightclub owners responsible for the actions of
valet parking companies they may hire.
   Waiting lines at popular nightspots will have to be limited and
supervised.
   Penalties for violations include a wide variety of license
restrictions, ranging from limits on the hours liquor can be served
to outright suspension of a club's license.
   The ban on displaying material of an ``improper or objectionable
nature'' in clubs outside the Combat Zone, the adult entertainment
district, came under criticism from the Civil Liberties Union of
Massachusetts.
   ``This is kind of a classic, so-called obscenity issue,'' said
John Roberts, the organization's executive director. ``We know that
in this society, standards obviously differ between what's
acceptable and not acceptable. Somehow, female nudity in a lot of
places is just sort of accepted, but now males is not.''
   John Reinstein, a lawyer with the CLU, said the ban on improper
material could be difficult to enforce. ``If I'm a restaurant owner
with a statue of Michelangelo's David in my place, is that covered
because it's nudity?'' he said.
   Ms. Gargiulo said the rule is not intended to ban nude prints
that hang inside some restaurants, but is aimed at material that is
``way out of line.''
   The guideline on objectionable material will be whether it would
be deemed unsuitable for view by members of the public if it were
located in areas such as public parks or government and business
offices.
   Enforcing the rules may be difficult, but not impossible, Ms.
Gargiulo said. ``They're very subjective and that's why we hold
hearings.''

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito, suffering from internal bleeding,
received more than a pint of blood Tuesday in his first transfusion
in two days, the Imperial Household Agency said.
   Before his transfusion, the 87-year-old monarch's blood pressure
fell below 100, as it did Oct. 1, said agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
   Maeda said Hirohito's blood pressure later recovered to 118 over
58 and his pulse declined to 108 beats a minute some 90 minutes
later. His temperature was 100.4, compared with his normal reading
of 95.9.
   The spokesman said the monarch was in stable condition and was
sleeping well in the evening.
   The blood transfusion Tuesday brought to about 25 pints the total
amount the emperor has received since his condition worsened Sept.
19.
   Court physicians believe the emperor has been bleeding from where
he was operated on in September 1987 to bypass an intestinal
blockage caused by an inflamed pancreas.
   The physicians have neither confirmed nor denied news reports
that the emperor has cancer in his upper digestive system.
   Palace officials said Hirohito was visited separately by several
members of the royal family, including Prince Akihito and his wife,
Princess Michiko, and in the afternoon by Akihito again.

   An Oregon anti-pornography activist who was
attacked in Hustler Magazine as a sex-fearing ``crackpot'' and
``deluded busybody'' cannot sue for libel because the statements
were matters of opinion, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.
   Though the 1985 article about Peggy Ault of Milwaukie, Ore., was
``disgusting and distasteful abuse'' and ``a grievous assault to her
human dignity,'' it contained no statements of fact that could be
the basis of a libel suit, said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   The 3-0 ruling also rejected claims of invasion of privacy and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. It reversed a federal
judge's order to Ms. Ault to pay Hustler $5,365 in legal fees for a
frivolous suit, saying the legal claims were ``not wholly
unreasonable.''
   ``This case is a good sign for us,'' said David Carson, a lawyer
for the magazine. He said several similar suits are pending, mostly
filed by lawyer Gerry Spence of Jackson, Wyo., whose law firm
represented Ms. Ault. Spence has also sued Hustler for libel because
of the magazine's satiric attack on him for his other suits, Carson
said.
   ``We're hopeful that in light of this ruling, some of the other
lawsuits that Mr. Spence has filed with similar claims might be
thrown out of court,'' Carson said.
   He also cited last year's Supreme Court ruling rejecting a suit
against Hustler by television preacher Jerry Falwell, who was the
subject of a sexual parody in the magazine.
   Lawyers for Ms. Ault did not return phone calls Tuesday.
   Ms. Ault founded a group called Citizens in Action for Clackamas
County, to protest a sex video store in Milwaukie, and has lobbied
for anti-pornography legislation through another group.
   Her suit involved an April 1985 Hustler article that was
illustrated by her photograph superimposed over the rear end of a
bent-over naked man.
   In the article, the magazine called Ms. Ault's local organization
a ``wacko group'' engaged in censorship and intimidation. It also
described her as ``frustrated,'' ``threatened by sex,'' a
``fanatic'' and ``crackpot,'' and a ``deluded busybody'' in need of
professional help.

<TEXT>
   A major builders' association on Tuesday said
it has found no evidence that energy-efficient homes increase radon
concentrations and that it is advising its members to build homes as
tight as possible.
   ``Our practices recommend good air sealing techniques,'' just as
would be used in trying to save energy, said John Spears, program
manager for the National Research Center, which is affiliated with
the National Home Builders Association.
   Some analysts have suggested that the increasing importance being
placed on energy efficiency also may be increasing the tendency of
radon, an odorless, radioactive gas given off by all soils, to
concentrate indoors.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has warned that although
increased ventilation may help particular radon-rich homes, as a
general rule well-ventilated homes appear to have no exemption from
radon buildup.
   EPA estimates that radon could be causing as many as 20,000
deaths from lung cancer each year. In September, the Public Health
Service issued a national health advisory warning of radon dangers
and the two agencies urged testing of every home where people live
on the second floor or below.
   As for home sealing, ``We're finding it has little to do with
radon,'' Spears said at a news conference. As a result, the
association is recommending ``the same practices we have recommended
for years for energy conservation. In fact, we've found that energy
conservation has little to do with radon concentration in the house.
We've measured houses all over the country.''
   The association recommended many techniques for reducing radon
buildup, such as carefully sealing off the basement _ often the same
techniques used for keeping water out.
   William H. Ethier, litigation counsel for the association, said
members were being advised that ``if they make a reasoned judgment
that there may be high radon levels,'' that they should ``rough in''
mitigation techniques such as under-slab ventilation pipes that may
be ignored later if appropriate, or connected to a fan to divert
radon-laden air around the basement.
   In states such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey with
well-publicized instances of radon buildup, Ethier said he has found
``universal'' adoption of such precautions by builders.
   Builders report that the techniques may add as little as $100 to
the cost of a home, if water barriers are already being used, but as
much as $600 if they are not, he said.

<TEXT>
   A Virginia Tech cadet was abducted by a
group of masked students who shaved his head in an attack that
apparently was sparked by an ice-throwing incident at a football
game, school officials said Tuesday.
   ``I think it's some overzealous behavior on the part of some
students who acted with malice,'' said Thomas Goodale, vice
president for student affairs. One of the eight to 10 students
accused of abducting and injuring Steve Woodberry, 19, of
Nokesville, has been arrested. More arrests are expected, Goodale
said.
   Woodberry was listed in stable condition with a bruised brain at
Roanoke Memorial Hospital.
   Jennings Cole II, 19, of Front Royal, faces charges of abduction,
hazing and malicious wounding, school officials said. All the
students involved are believed to be members of the Corps of Cadets
Highty Tighty band, but the university does not hold the corps
responsible, Goodale said.
   Goodale said he did not consider the incident to have been
hazing, but rather ``a personal matter between students.''
   Goodale said the attack occurred in the early morning hours
Thursday when the students wearing ski masks knocked on Woodberry's
door, abducted him and took him to a campus duck pond where they
shaved his head with an electric razor. The episode appeared to have
been thoroughly plotted, with some students standing guard, Goodale
said.
   The attack was broken up when Virginia Tech police on a routine
patrol came along, he said. One of the students' ski masks was
removed, leading to Cole's arrest Monday, he said.
   Woodberry was initially treated on campus and released Friday. He
participated in a field exercise that day but was taken to
Montgomery Regional Hospital on Sunday when other students became
concerned about a bad headache he had.
   The attack apparently was prompted by an ice-throwing incident at
the Virginia Tech-West Virginia football game on Oct. 1, Goodale
said.
   Woodberry has since left the band.

   Olympic kayak gold medalist Norman Bellingham
joined Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen on Tuesday
at a rally for National Drug Free America Week.
   Similar rallies were held in 20 other cities. Drug Free America
Week is a Cabinet initiative designed to spur town meetings,
conferences and fund-raising activities across the nation to support
community drug prevention projects.
   ``Americans now have a deeper understanding of the health dangers
of illicit drug use,'' Bowen said. ``People have come to understand
that illicit drug use can mean addiction or death.''
   The health chief cited the special danger of injecting drugs
intravenously.
   ``Sharing contaminated needles is like playing Russian Roulette
with the AIDS virus,'' said Bowen. ``Intravenous drug abusers now
make up more than a quarter of all cases of AIDS diagnosed thus
far.''
   Bowen called on parents to take the lead in fighting drugs with
some specific advice:
   _``Education your children about the dangers of illicit drug use.
Share with them information about the health impact of drug use and
teach them how to just say no.
   _``Watch for the early warning signs _ dropping grades, behavior
change, stolen money or missing items of value.
   -``Provide positive alternatives for your children. When children
have nothing interesting to motivate them, then they may be tempted
to turn to drugs.
   _``Personally remain drug free. Many children learn about drug
use from their parents. If you have a problem, find treatment.
   _``Help make your neighborhood and work-site drug free. If you
know someone who has a problem, whether in your neighborhood or at
work, help them to get help. You may be their last, best hope.''

   The Ku Klux Klan and 12 individuals must pay about
$1 million to 53 civil rights marchers who were pelted with rocks
and bottles during a demonstration in virtually all-white Forsyth
County, according to a verdict unsealed Tuesday.
   The activists marched into the county north of Atlanta on Jan.
17, 1987, and were attacked by counter-demonstrators, many of them
KKK members or sympathizers.
   Named as defendants in the U.S. District Court lawsuit were the
Southern White Knights of the KKK, the Invisible Empire Knights of
the KK and 12 individuals.
   The jury reached its verdict Oct. 5, but Judge Charles A. Moye
Jr. ordered it sealed to give marchers who brought the lawsuit time
to decide whether to join Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams,
who wanted to drop the lawsuit.
   Williams, who helped organize the march and was among those who
filed suit, urged toward the end of the trial that the lawsuit be
dropped because it would impoverish the families of KKK members.
   In a letter to those who filed with him, Williams said he had
talked to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and that
King told him ``Jesus wanted him not to sue the Klan.'' He and three
other defendants dropped out.
   State Rep. William McKinney, who had opposed Williams' move to
drop the lawsuit, said Williams' ``religion and communication with
the dead should not interfere with our constitutional rights and
justice.''
   The award gave $50 each to the marchers in general damages. The
rest was in punitive damages. The lawsuit had sought $1.5 million.
   The two Klan organizations were fined $400,000 each. David
Holland, Grand Dragon of the White Knights, was fined $50,000.
Individual fines ranged from $30,000 to $1,000, except for Harold
Palmour, who was judged not to be liable and was not fined.
   The ``brotherhood march'' was a forerunner to a larger
demonstration a week later in which an estimated 24,000 persons
turned out. State, local, county and federal troops were called out
to protect the marchers and to prevent violence.
   A march into the county a year ago commemorating the anniversary
of the 1987 marches was peaceful.

   Vice President George Bush remained a favorite to
win the Nov. 8 presidential election at very short odds of 1-7,
bookmakers said Tuesday.
   The figures mean a bettor has to pay $7 dollars to win $1, plus
his stake back.
   The odds on Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis winning were 7-2,
meaning $7 dollars plus the returned stake would be won for a $2 bet.
   ``The odds have not changed in the past week,'' said Sandy
Wilkinson, a spokesman for the Ladbrokes bookmakers.
   ``Quite a bit of money has gone on Bush in Britain and we have
had some big bets telephoned from the United States, some of them
from famous people,'' she said. She would not disclose their names.

<HEAD>Largest Iranian Oil Port To Be Opened To Foreign Ships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NABILA MEGALLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran will open its main oil port to
foreign vessels as it pulls its own tankers out of service from the
Persian Gulf route heavily attacked during its war with Iraq,
shipping sources said Tuesday.
   Iran will eliminate service by Iranian-operated tankers from
Kharg Island in the northeastern gulf to the Sirri terminal in the
south by the end of the year, according to the London-based Lloyd's
Shipping Intelligence Unit, which monitors maritime traffic.
   It quoted Mohammad Souri, chairman and managing director of the
National Iranian Tanker Co., as saying he expected foreign tankers
to take over the transport of half of Iran's oil exports from Kharg
within a month and all of it within two months.
   Iraq imposed an air and sea blockade around Kharg in 1984, a move
that triggered the tanker war in which more than 500 ships were
attacked by both countries.
   Iran is exporting an estimated 1.4 million barrels of oil a day.
Officials have said they plan to increase their long-term export
capacity to around 4.5 million barrels a day.
   The Lloyd's report underlined Iranian efforts to restore normal
oil export operations following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the
8-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
   Gulf-based shipping officials reported earlier this month the
Iranians had stopped exercising their legal right to stop vessels
suspected of carrying war-related cargoes to Iraq.
   They also reported that Iran has withdrawn all its armed
speedboats from the southern gulf island of Abu Musa island, which
was used as a base from which to attack neutral ships in reprisal
for Iraqi air raids on tankers carrying Iranian oil. The last
Iranian attack was a speedboat raid on a Norwegian tanker on Aug.4.
   Japan's shipowners and maritime union Tuesday lifted a ban it
imposed last year to keep its ships from sailing to Kharg.
   A shipping source who requested anonymity said there were
unconfirmed reports that a Japanese tanker had already loaded at
Kharg and left the gulf. Shipments from Kharg account for 90 percent
of Iran's oil exports, which made the port a target of repeated
Iraqi air raids aimed at strangling the oil sales that financed
Tehran's war effort.
   Lloyd's quoted Souri as saying negotiations are under way to
return some of Iran's 17 chartered oil vessels to international
service, a move expected to depress the tanker market.
   At the peak of the war, the Iranians had a shuttle fleet of more
than 30 tankers, many of them charters, because foreign vessels
would not risk Iraqi attacks to reach Kharg.
   Gulf-based shipping executives said the 547,841-ton Burmah
Endeavor, which was used as a storage vessel for crude oil shipped
from Kharg, was in the southern gulf port of Dubai for reconversion
to sea duty. The British-flagged supertanker was damaged in an Iraqi
air raid in May.
   Lloyd's said that disbanding Iran's tanker service would save
Iran an estimated $300 million a year.
   Kharg and its tankers were bombed scores of times by Iraq's air
force and the port was heavily fortified with anti-aircraft and
missile batteries.
   The Iranians tried to circumvent the Iraqi blockade by installing
a makeshift terminal at Sirri Island, about 350 miles south.
   Foreign tankers loaded there until the Iraqis raided Sirri in
1986. Loading operations were then moved another 120 miles south to
Larak island in the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the gulf.
   But Iraqi warplanes began hitting Larak as well, culminating in a
May 14 strike in which several supertankers were sunk or crippled.
   The U.S. Navy severely damaged the Sirri platform on April 18 in
retaliatory raids for the mining of a U.S. warship.
   Since the cease-fire, Sirri's terminal has reopened, shipping
officials said, while Larak has ceased to function as an oil
terminal.

   Two sisters who work on an assembly line
produced the winning ticket Tuesday to a Lotto jackpot worth more
than $31.5 million and said they would split the prize.
   ``We always go in together,'' said Mary Ellen Snipes.
   She and her sister, Maxine Johnson, both of the southeast Florida
farming community of Indiantown, took the day off from work to file
their claim.
   The women will share $1,576,743 a year before taxes for the next
20 years.
   Mrs. Snipes, who said her ex-husband picked the winning numbers
from her pay-check stub, said she plans to keep working and would
build a ``dream house'' with her newfound wealth.
   But Mrs. Johnson said she wasn't sure yet if she would keep
working and said she didn't know what she would do with her half of
the money. But she said she would stay on the job at least until
next Wednesday, when the first check is expected to arrive.
   The sisters are assembly line leaders at Solitron Devices, an
electronic components firm in Riviera Beach.
   Both declined to give their ages or the ages of their children,
but said all were grown. Mrs. Johnson said she has four children and
Mrs. Snipes said she had three. Both women said they were
grandmothers, but did not say how many grandchildren they have.
   Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Snipes have two other sisters, one in
Jacksonville and one in West Palm Beach.
   The two sisters, regular Lotto players, bought 10 of the $1
tickets last week.
   But Mrs. Snipes said she almost didn't play. After working
Saturday, she was tired and had decided she wasn't going to bother
with it. Her ex-husband, Lewis Snipes, came over and prodded her
into it, she said.
   Snipes, who was at the press conference, was asked if he was
going to get any of the money.
   ``That's still in question,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An Iowa State University student who
served a seven-month jail term for contempt of court was freed
Tuesday after the son he sent away to Jordan was returned to the
boy's mother.
   ``I think I did the right thing,'' said Ahmed Amro, of the
decision two years ago to send the child away. His son and ex-wife
were reunited Monday night.
   Amro was sentenced to an indefinite jail term by District Judge
M.L. Seiser last March when Amro did not comply with a divorce
decree awarding custody of his 4-year-old son, Mujahid, to Amro's
ex-wife, Souad Mejdouli.
   The boy was greeted by his mother at the Des Moines International
Airport late Monday after the journey from Jordan, and Amro was
released about 10 hours later.
   ``I didn't believe it, I'm still in shock,'' said Ms. Mejdouli,
who lives in Ames, north of here. ``I think my son was in shock,
too, but I'm awfully glad to have him back. We have a lot of things
to catch up on, a lot of hugging and kissing.''
   Amro at first demanded that the issue of child custody be decided
by Islamic laws rather than Iowa courts, and he later said he should
be freed from jail because there was nothing he could do to gain
return of the child.
   Amro sent his son to Jordan two years ago to live with Amro's
sister after Amro was convicted of beating his wife. Ms. Mejdouli
later divorced him and won custody of the child.
   Amro, a computer engineering student at Iowa State, contended
that his father, a devout Moslem, refused to allow the boy to
return, but his plea to overturn the indefinite jail confinement was
denied by the Iowa Supreme Court.
   ``It's no place for a human being,'' Amro said Tuesday of his
jail stay, but said he made the right decision about his son.
   ``I wanted him to be away while there was a dispute between
myself and his mother. He probably would have been psychologically
ruined'' if he had witnessed the dispute, Amro said. He said he
intended for the boy to be away only for a month or two.
   He said the grandfather changed his mind when he was told of the
Supreme Court's decision.
   Amro said he has been a permanent U.S. resident for five years
and has applied for citizenship.
   Amro said he wants to finish the semester of school needed for
his bachelor's degree, and will seek visitation rights.
   ``I don't want to be a part-time dad. I want to always be there
for my son when he needs me,'' Amro said. ``I want to see him as
much as I can. I want to be involved in his life.''
   ``Oh, yeah,'' retorted Ms. Mejdouli in a separate interview.
``That's why he sent him overseas for two years. We don't trust him.
That's the same game he played with us two years ago.''
   A visitation hearing has been set in Seiser's court for Thursday
morning.

   A small task force of Soviet warships is making
its way toward Cuba in what appears to be a routine deployment, the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The task force is led by a Udaloy-class guided-missile destroyer
and includes at least two other vessels _ a Krivak-class
guided-missile frigate and an Olekma-class replenishment oiler, a
Pentagon statement said.
   If normal procedures are being followed, however, those three
surface ships are being accompanied by a diesel-powered submarine,
it added.
   The group, now steaming in the Atlantic south of Bermuda, should
arrive in Cuba before the end of the week.
   ``Two Soviet Bear-D reconnaissance aircraft and two Bear-F
anti-submarine warfare aircraft arrived in Cuba last week, and may
participate in exercises with the Soviet surface ships,'' the
Pentagon said.
   The deployment of Soviet warships to the Caribbean is not
unusual, although this is the first such movement in two years.
According to the Navy, it is the 27th such operation conducted by
the Soviets since 1969.
   U.S. forces will maintain surveillance of the ships, particularly
if they move into the Gulf of Mexico for exercises, the Pentagon
said.

<HEAD>Public Housing Tenants to Buy Own Apartments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tenants of a public housing development in
a poverty-stricken, drug-laden neighborhood took the first step
Tuesday toward buying the housing project.
   ``This is a dream becoming reality,'' said community activist
Kimi Gray, chairman of the Kenilworth-Parkside Management Corp.,
which received final approval for its bid to purchase the 464
apartments from the District of Columbia city government for $1.
``We've worked six years for this.''
   After the complex is renovated, in several years, residents will
be able to buy their apartments for as little as $10,000 each.
   The occasion marked the first instance in history in which public
housing tenants arranged to buy their own apartments.
   Gray organized the tenant corporation, which took over management
of the project in 1982, reducing administrative costs by 60 percent.
   Before that, when it had been managed by a private firm under
contract to the city, it was rat-infested and run down. Apartments
had no heat or hot water; the chain link fence was squashed and
rusted.
   ``We have a vested interest,'' explained Gray in an interview at
the time. ``We live here, so we really care. We're supersensitive.''
   The sale to the tenants was made possible through a 1987 law
authorizing the conversion of several public housing projects across
the country to tenant ownership to demonstrate whether the idea was
feasible.
   The actual sale will not take effect until after the completion
of a $23 million federally financed renovation of the 33-building
complex. The Department of Housing and Urban Development also will
provide $6 million in rental assistance over the next five years.
   The tenants corporation plans to help tenants increase their
incomes so they can afford to buy their apartments, said Alphonso
Jackson, director of the city's Department of Public and Assisted
Housing.
   So far, 132 residents have been removed from welfare rolls as
result of the corporation's ``entrepreneurial ventures,'' such as a
day care center and janitorial service, he said.

   A man who identified himself as a born-again
Christian rode his converted school bus early Tuesday into the lobby
of a theater where he had viewed the controversial film, ``The Last
Temptation of Christ,'' police said.
   Stanley Watin, 49, of Etna, was charged with second-degree
criminal mischief, a felony, said Ithaca Police Sgt. David Barnes.
   Watin pronounced himself guilty during his arraignment before
Judge John Sherman, who ordered Watin held in the county jail in
lieu of $5,000 cash or $10,000 bail bond.
   Watin, a car salesman, turned himself in to authorities after
driving his bus into the front lobby of Fall Creek Pictures around
6:10 a.m. The impact knocked down a supporting beam inside the
theater, causing portions of the ceiling to fall. The theater's
large, plate-glass windows were shattered and broken glass was
scattered throughout the lobby, said owner Tsvi Bokaer.
   Bokaer said Watin watched the Martin Scorsese film Sunday night
and had to be removed by police after shouting profanities before
and during the movie.
   The film has ignited protests worldwide among Christians because
it presents Jesus as a human struggling to overcome the temptation
to forsake his destiny as Christ.

   The daytime drama ``Ryan's Hope'' has been
canceled after 13{ years, because too many affiliates pre-empt the
noontime soap opera for local newscasts, ABC announced Tuesday.
   The series will have its last broadcast on Jan. 13.
   ```Ryan's Hope' has not been rejected by the audience, it has
simply been unavailable to viewers'' because of pre-emptions, said
Jo Ann Emmerich, vice president of daytime programs for ABC
Entertainment. ``Without sufficient stations to carry it, it has
become a victim of audience erosion.''
   At its lowest ebb, the show was carried by only 75 percent of
ABC's affiliates. ABC elected not to move it because there was no
appropriate timeslot for a half-hour drama.
   The series is set in New York and follows the exploits of an
Irish-Catholic family. It has won 17 Daytime Emmys and 11 Writers
Guild awards.
   ABC said a replacement program would be announced soon.

<TEXT>
   An illegal repair job was blamed Tuesday for the
collapse of a six-story building that crumbled like a house of
cards, killing one person and injuring about 12 others.
   The owner of the building in Manhattan's Garment District died
when one wall fell away and the interior floors tumbled to the
ground Monday afternoon.
   One survivor, Robin Fischer, 27, of Brooklyn, underwent surgery
Tuesday to repair damage to her crushed legs. Fischer, who
apparently was working on the sixth floor of the building, was
pulled from the rubble more than eight hours later when rescuers
heard her say, ``I'm Robin. Get me out.''
   Police and investigators from the Manhattan district attorney's
office examined the wreckage Tuesday as emergency crews continued to
dismantle what remained of the building.
   ``So far there's been no one arrested,'' said Gloria Montealegre,
a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
``We're still in the process of finding out if there's any criminal
liability.''
   The building was owned by Frank DeSantis, 64, whose body was
pulled from the rubble late Monday night. Buildings Commissioner
Charles Smith said DeSantis had apparently hired a contractor to
repair the building after he noticed a bulge in its western wall.
   As workers began to remove old sections of the wall to repair it,
Smith said, ``bricks started popping out.'' Then, he said, the
workers dug a trench along the wall and tried to shore it up with
wooden planks.
   ``That didn't do any good and probably (did) more harm,'' the
commissioner said. ``Shortly after that, the wall collapsed.''
   Smith said he didn't know why the contractor, John Varkaris of
JRV Construction Co., dug the ditch. Varkaris did not immediately
return a message left Tuesday on an answering machine at his home.
   A man who answered the telephone Tuesday at DeSantis' office
declined to discuss the incident. ``We're taking no calls and making
no comments,'' he said.
   Smith said the work was similar to that being done at a
five-story building in Greenwich Village that collapsed last
November, trapping five residents and killing a 13-month-old boy. In
both cases, he said, the work was being done without permits.

<HEAD>NY Court Rules Random Urine Testing of Elite Police Force Legal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Random urine testing for drugs among an elite
corps of New York City police officers is legal because of the
dangerous and sensitive nature of their work, a divided New York
state Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday.
   The 5-2 decision by the state's top court not only overturns two
lower court rulings, it constitutes an ``about face'' for a court
which only last year ruled that a drug-testing plan for Long Island
teachers was an unreasonable invasion of their privacy, the
dissenting judges said.
   The court decision upholds New York City Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward's 1986 order that members of the department's
Organized Crime Control Bureau must undergo random urinalysis for
drugs. Approximately 1,100 of the city's 27,000 police officers
volunteer for duty in the special unit. Up to 90 percent are
involved in narcotics-related work.
   ``The terror-filled world they are working in requires the
sternest precautionary safeguards to weed out drug abusers from
their own ranks,'' wrote Judge Joseph Bellacosa for the majority.
   The court ruled unanimously last year in a case involving
Patchogue teachers that governments couldn't force public employees
to take drug tests unless there is a ``reasonable suspicion'' that
workers are using drugs.
   Much of Bellacosa's 14-page ruling was taken up with an
explanation of why the police officers should be held to stricter
standards than the teachers. The lower courts incorrectly gave an
``absolutist reading'' to the Court of Appeals' decision in the
teachers' case, he said.
   The ``direct correlation'' between an organized crime officer's
work and drugs should be considered in evaluating the extent of
their constitutional rights to privacy, Bellacosa wrote.
   ``The officers agree to undergo microscopic examinations of their
personal lives, their financial affairs and their professional
judgment calls,'' Bellacosa said. ``Realistically, the proposed
random drug testing in these narrow circumstances is just another
layer of an already heightened, persistent and employee-expected
scrutiny.''
   Judge Judith Kaye, in a dissenting opinion, said the government
hasn't established why the testing is needed or why the officers
should be held to such special standards.
   ``The public clearly has an interest in the integrity of every
employee who serves it,'' Kaye wrote. ``Equally clearly, that alone
does not give the state the power to conduct intrusive searches of
their person.''
   According to court papers, all city police recruits are tested
for drugs when they apply to the department, again during their
five-month police academy training and at the end of their 18-month
probation. Tenured officers are subject to testing if there's a
reasonable suspicion of drug use.
   Officers applying to the organized crime unit were required by
Ward in 1986 to sign a form acknowledging that periodic drug testing
was a condition of employment.
   The policemen's union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association,
sued to overturn the order two days after it was announced.
   Raymond Kerno, the union's lawyer, said he was surprised at the
decision.
   He called the drug testing an ``excessive attempt'' to solve a
problem that doesn't really exist.
   The decision gives new life to municipalities who hope to start
drug testing programs, said Michael Adler, a lawyer in New York
City's corporation counsel's office.
   The city in late 1987 tried to institute random drug testing for
all corrections officers, he said. But lower courts have struck down
the program, citing the Patchogue case, he said.
   ``I think certainly those who might favor drug testing are
probably better equipped to make a legal argument justifying the
testing than they had before this decision came down,'' Adler said.
   According to police department records, narcotics-related
disciplinary charges have been filed against 10 police officers in
the crime unit in four years.
   Kaye said these statistics show there's no indication of a drug
abuse problem within this unit. ``The important goal of deterrence
... is not, without evidence of a pervasive problem among the
persons to be tested, justification for this search,'' she said.

<HEAD>Leader Of Bethel Home And Assistants Indicted On State Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The defiant director of a fundamentalist
children's home and two assistants were indicted by a state grand
jury Tuesday in connection with a June confrontation with law
enforcement officers.
   The Rev. Herman Fountain, 38, and Michael Baldino, 25, were
indicted on three counts each of felonious assault on a law
enforcement officer, while two counts were lodged against
18-year-old Phil Reining. A Friday arraignment hearing in George
County Circuit Court was set for the three.
   Fountain and his assistants are accused of assaulting law
officers who stormed the Bethel Home for Children on June 13 and
took custody of allegedly abused and neglected youth. The unlicensed
school is operated by the independent Bethel Baptist Church.
   The indictments were handed down by a George County grand jury
that went into session Monday. Fountain and the two assistants drove
to the George County Courthouse after they were notified by Circuit
Clerk Wilbur Ward about the indictments and they were allowed to
remain free on bonds that were posted after the confrontation.
   Fountain has been free on $40,000 bond, Baldino on $20,000 bond
and Reining on $10,000 bond.
   ``I don't feel like they're after me, I feel like they're after
the church,'' Fountain said when he arrived at the courthouse.
   County Prosecutor Mark Maples was in court Tuesday and
unavailable for comment.
   Fountain, who has claimed to be a former heroin addict and
witchcraft practitioner, has said he had as many as 120 children
living at his 28-acre compound outside Lucedale.
   He claims his right to freedom of religion exempts him from any
state oversight, but a George County Youth Court judge, looking into
allegations of beatings and other abuse, ordered the state
Department of Public Welfare last June to take custody of the Bethel
residents.
   Some state law officers have accused Fountain of ordering the
children to flee the compound. Fountain denies the allegation. It
took officials several days to round up the children.
   The minister is accused of punching law officers after they
stormed the locked church in search of the children. Several
witnesses, including reporters, saw Fountain swing at lawmen.
   The minister has appealed a separate disorderly conduct
conviction in justice court. He has been fined $200 for the charge,
which also stems from the June 13 incident. His initial circuit
court appearance in the appeal is scheduled for Oct. 31.

<TEXT>
   Castleberry's Food Co., Augusta, Ga., is
voluntarily recalling 51,985 cans of corned beef hash in six states
because 912 cans did not go through the required heat processing,
the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The recall affects suspected products in Alabama, Georgia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan and New Jersey. Officials said
the suspected corn beef could contain food poisoning organisms,
including some that could cause botulism, a deadly form of poisoning.
   The product, Castleberry's Single Serve Canned Corned Beef Hash,
is packaged in 7{-ounce cans with pull tabs and is sold mostly in
vending machines. A small percentage of the product is sold also in
convenience and grocery stores.
   The products are identified by the code numbers 2J81CBV3 or
2J81CBV4 on the bottom of the cans. The USDA inspection mark shows
Est. 195.
   ``Although no illnesses have been reported, we strongly urge
consumers to avoid tasting the products and to return them
immediately to the establishment where they were purchased,'' said
Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service.
   Vending machine operators and other distributors were advised to
remove the product from sale and hold it for pickup by the company.
   Crawford said that Castleberry's discovered that part of one
day's production is not sterile and will allow the growth of any
food spoilage organisms that may be present.
   Among these organisms may be Clostridium botulinum, which causes
botulism, which was described in the announcement as ``a serious
form of food poisoning.'' Other literature published by USDA,
however, calls botulism ``an extremely deadly form of food
poisoning.''

<TEXT>
   Former President Isabel Peron made
a surprise visit to her homeland Tuesday.
   ``I wanted to be in Argentina and here I am,'' she told reporters
at Ezeiza International Airport.
   Mrs. Peron's arrival from Spain, where she has lived since 1981,
comes at the beginning of what promises to be a bitter political
campaign that will culminate in national elections next May.
   Mrs. Person, 57, has stayed out of politics since she was
overthrown in 1976 by the military and held under house arrest for
five years. She succeeded her husband, Juan Peron, when he died in
1974.
   But her sympathies appear to lie more with President Raul
Alfonsin of the Radical Civic Union than with the opposition
Peronist Party.
   Lesio Romero, secretary of the Meatpackers Union, said, ``The
unexpected arrival of Mrs. Peron is very strange. We understand she
was invited by the national government. I hope she doesn't intend to
involve herself with our (Peronist) movement.''
   The Peronist Party is divided among supporters of presidential
candidate Carlos Menem, the front-runner and governor of the poor
province of La Rioja, and Buenos Aires Gov. Antonio Cafiero.
   Last weekend, Menem said his party might try to impeach Alfonsin
``because of the perverse political economy applied by the national
government.''
   Alfonsin is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election.
   The Radical Civic Union candidate for president is Eduardo
Angeloz, the governor of prosperous Cordoba province.
   Mrs. Peron's visit is her third since Alfonsin was inaugurated
president in December 1983. The previous two visits were at
Alfonsin's invitation.
   Mrs. Peron's turbulent 20 months in office were marked by
kidnappings and assassinations conducted by left- and right-wing
political extremists, and an economic collapse.
   Mrs. Peron was elected vice-president in the 1973 election her
husband won by a landslide after returning to Argentine politics
from an eighteen-year exile in Madrid.
   Peron was elected president in 1946 and re-elected in 1951. He
was overthrown by the military in 1955.
   He met Maria Estela Martinez, known as Isabel, at a night club in
Panama after the 1955 coup. She became his secretary and followed
him to Venezuela and Spain, where she became his third wife.

   A man who shot his wife last summer in a
struggle over whether to kill the family dog received a suspended
jail sentence after his spouse said the incident had strengthened
their marriage.
   Danelle Dickelman, 27, of rural Horace, asked East Central
District Judge Cynthia Rothe for leniency for her husband, Paul,
during Dickelman's sentencing Tuesday on a conviction for reckless
endangerment.
   Dickelman, 31, who spent five days in jail after the shooting
last June, had suffered enough, Mrs. Dickelman told the judge.
   Dickelman had been drinking and was intent on shooting the family
dog when the incident occurred, said John Goff, an assistant Cass
County state's attorney. The dog had angered Dickelman because of
its habit of urinating on the carpet in their home, the prosecutor
said.
   Mrs. Dickelman struggled with her husband before he shot her with
a .22-caliber pistol, Goff said. Mrs. Dickelman told the judge at
Tuesday's sentencing that the shooting was an accident.
   The pistol was loaded with birdshot, and Mrs. Dickelman suffered
pellet wounds in her mouth. She has since recovered, according to
Goff.
   Mrs. Dickelman said the incident had prompted her husband to seek
help for a drinking problem, and that the couple ``were trying to
turn this ... into a positive thing,'' Goff said.
   Rothe sentenced Dickelman to a year in jail for the misdemeanor
and then suspended all but the five days he had served and placed
him on two years' probation.
   The judge said Dickelman must refrain from drinking, using drugs
or handling firearms during his probation and also must perform 200
hours of community service work.

<HEAD>Commission Finds Firing of Coach Racially Motivated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Commission Against
Discrimination has found that the 1985 firing of the only black
coach in the Pittsfield West Little League was racially motivated.
   David Williams filed a complaint with the state commission after
he was dismissed as coach of the Connor Pharmacy team in June 1985
following a series of disputes with league officials. Among other
things, Williams contended that league Umpire-In-Chief Ralph
Stannard had called him ``boy'' in a ``racially and personally
derogatory manner in the course of a game.''
   At the time, the league of six teams had no black players,
according to the commission. Each team has at least one coach, all
of whom serve for free, according to league Secretary-Treasurer John
Marchesi.
   Following its finding, the state commission attempted to mediate
the dispute between Williams and the league, but no conclusion was
reached in a three-hour meeting Monday, said Rosemary Nevins,
commission staff council.
   She said that if no agreement could be worked out privately
between the parties, the commission could hold public hearings.
After that the issue could be decided by the courts.
   The main sticking point, according to Williams was the wording of
an apology he sought from league officials. He said that he had
never sought monetary compensation from the league but wanted the
apology to boost his chances of seeking other coaching jobs.
   ``If there is a statement to be issued,'' he said. ``I just want
it to clarify that I'm not the troublemaker some people might make
me out to be. This isn't a situation I created.''
   Williams, who works as a wireman at General Electric Co., had
previously coached junior varsity baseball at Lee High School and
junior varsity girls basketball at Taconic High School in
Pittsfield. He had initially filed a civil suit against the league
over his dismissal in 1985, but withdrew the action in favor of
pursuing a complaint through the commission.
   ``I couldn't afford to co through the courts,'' Williams said. He
said the cost of the complaint was about half that of a civil suit.

   Gary Bauer, a top-ranking domestic policy

a private foundation that will focus on family issues.
   Bauer, 42, who worked for then-Education Secretary William
Bennett before coming to the White House in 1986, was a principal
advocate within the White House for such conservative social agenda
causes as school prayer and abolition of legal abortions.
   Reagan attended a private farewell party for Bauer on Tuesday

<HEAD>Nation's Cartoonists Mount Comic-Page Campaign for the Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA BARNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   America's cartoonists used their pens to skewer disdain and
apathy toward the homeless in a concerted campaign on the comic
pages Tuesday. Nancy and Sluggo played ``homeless couple,'' a
homeless man offered to share his meal of popcorn with Ziggy, and
Marmaduke befriended homeless dogs.
   ``The whole purpose of this is to draw attention to the plight of
the homeless, to make people aware that something needs to be
done,'' said Bill Day, a syndicated Detroit Free Press cartoonist
who was one of more than 100 comic-strip and editorial cartoonists
to participate in the project.
   ``The wealthy can afford lobbying groups. I feel the purpose of
the cartoonist is to help those who can't afford a lobby,'' said
Day, who drew a prosperous, well-fed Uncle Sam gazing in the mirror
and seeing a gaunt-faced version of himself labeled the homeless,
holding his coat together at the neck. There are no official counts
of the number of homeless, but national estimates range from 350,000
to more than 3 million, according to the National Low Income Housing
Coalition, an organizer of the project.
   Some of the artists got their messages across through humor,
others used irony or exaggeration. Some of the cartoons were
political: taking aim at the presidential campaign or Washington
posturing.
   Garry Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' simply focused on the humanity of
a panhandling couple, Alice and Elmont. When a tired Elmont mistakes
his wife for a rival on his corner, he apologizes by explaining he
mistook her for ``some gorgeous hooker,'' and she goes off pleased.
   Other cartoonists relied on the naivete of outsiders, be they
children or observers from a different time like Hagar the Viking.
Dik Browne, Hagar's creator, has his hero and his wife in front of a
fortune teller, who predicts, ``One day, millions of people will be
homeless, and millions of others who could easily help will just
turn away.''
   Responds the fierce Viking: ``And they call ME horrible.''
   In the ``Middletons,'' by Ralph Bunagin and Dana Summers, a child
watches as his mother puts change in a street person's cup. After
she explains the man is homeless and the money is for food, the
youngster says, ``Gosh, he'd get more to eat if I gave him my
trick-or-treat bag.''
   Some of the cartoons had a distinctly political cast, partisan or
not.
   In Cathy Guisewaite's ``Cathy,'' her mom is shown listening to a
campaign speech and getting more and more agitated at the
politician's rhetoric. Finally, when he declares that he'll invest
in a strong defense to keep the country safe for the homeless, she
explodes, telling him to go to bed without dinner and announcing:
``This country doesn't need a president. It needs a mother.''
   The Arizona Republic's Steve Bensen contributed an editorial
cartoon showing a Dukakis figure sitting on a heating grate in
sidewalk in front of the White House with a shopping cart filled
with Dukakis, Jackson and other campaign signs. Above the drawing it
says: ``Cartoonist Homeless Prject. He's a painful reminder of
what's wrong with America _ abandoned, homeless, living on the
streets. Let's keep him that way.'' Below the drawing, it says,
``Vote Bush Nov. 8th.''
   But some cartoonists were able to find a touch of humor, like
Mell Lazarus of ``Momma.'' In that strip, Momma's son raids her
refrigerator because he doesn't have any food at his apartment.
Momma tells him, ``Francis, do you realize there are people in this
country who are totally homeless, while you have two of them?''
   ``If a kid tells his parents, `Hey look. All the comics are about
homeless people today,' we will at least have raised their
consciousness,'' Lazarus said.

   Nicaragua struggled Tuesday to recover
from a hurricane that killed at least 60 people and left 300,000
homeless in this Central American nation. Help poured in from a
dozen countries.
   Floods and strong winds heavily damaged crops throughout
Nicaragua.
   Hurricane Joan killed another 63 people elsewhere in Latin
America _ 23 in Costa Rica, four in Panama, 25 in Colombia and 11 in
Venezuela _ before it crossed Central America and was reborn Monday
in the Pacific as Tropical Storm Miriam.
   At 5 p.m. EDT Tuesday, an advisory from the U.S. National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said the storm had weakened
to a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of about 35
mph.
   It said the storm was centered near latitude 13.8 north,
longitude 94.3 west, or about 180 miles south-southeast of Salina
Cruz, Mexico. It said the storm was moving west at about 9 mph.
   Public Safety Minister Reynaldo Antonio Tefel, head of
Nicaragua's national emergency committee, told diplomats in Managua
that the hurricane death toll had risen by 10, to 60, in a country
already battered by seven years of civil war.
   Officials worked to restore power and water in the capital.
Public buses and trucks were pressed into service to take evacuees
home. No public transport was operating between Managua and the rest
of the country. Nationwide, only about 40 percent of public
transport was running.
   The official Voice of Nicaragua radio broadcast pleas for money
and goods for the 38,000 residents of storm-wrecked Bluefields and
other hard-hit Atlantic areas such as nearby Corn Island.
   ``Paradise in Ruins,'' the official Sandinista newspaper
Barricada said in a headline over the first photographs from the
island.
   Britain said it was giving $17,000 to Nicaragua's national
emergency committee. West Germany donated $140,000 and offered
$500,000 worth of technical assistance.
   The European Economic Community offered $100,000 to help the
homeless. The French medical group, Doctors Without Borders, said a
16-member medical team and 17 tons of supplies would arrive in
Bluefields on Wednesday.
   Spain, Austria, Norway and Switzerland and private humanitarian
groups in Europe and the United States promised to send medical
personnel and supplies.
   Relief supplies from Cuba and Mexico were already being
distributed.
   The White House said Monday it didn't expect a request for help.
When specifically asked, however, President Daniel Ortega of
Nicaragua said this country would accept U.S. hurricane aid if it
were offered without conditions.
   Ortega previously said the best aid the United States could offer
would be to stop supporting the rebels, known as Contras. The
government estimates its 7-year-old war with the Contras has caused
damage worth $12 billion.
   In Costa Rica, President Oscar Arias said the discovery of two
drowning victims near the border with Panama pushed the storm death
toll there to 23. He reckoned damage at $62 million and said the
hurricane flooded 75 towns, destroyed 1,500 homes, damaged six
hospitals and ruined banana, coffee, rice and bean crops.
   Arias told a news conference that Costa Rica, a nation of 2.5
million people, would need international help to recover.
   ``Places like Neilly, Cortes, Perez Zeledon, Palmar Norte,
Dominical and Parrita are cut off,'' he reported.
   In Guatemala, El Salvador and southern Mexico, states of alert
were canceled as Miriam moved away.
   No damage or injuries were reported in Guatemala, Mexico or El
Salvador and a two-week cycling tour resumed Tuesday in Guatemala
after being cut short by 10 miles Monday because of rain.

   Saying America's debt to military men and women
doesn't end ``the day the uniform comes off,'' President Reagan
signed legislation Tuesday giving veterans a Cabinet-level voice for
the first time.
   ``I'm saying to all our veterans what I say to new Cabinet
members: Welcome aboard!''' said Reagan, the self-proclaimed enemy
of an expanding federal government, who once suggested abolishing
the departments of Education and Energy.
   Sitting under a sparkling autumnal sun in front of a columned
building of the National War College at Fort McNair, the president
signed into law the bill creating the Department of Veterans
Affairs, effective March 15.
   Spokesmen for veterans organizations applauded the elevation of
veterans issues in the councils of government, but noted that the
legislation offers no increases in compensation or improvements in
health care.
   Cooper T. Holt, executive director of the Washington office of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said he recalled the day _ last Nov.
10 _ that Reagan signaled he had accepted Cabinet-level status for
veterans.
   ``There were several of us over there at the White House, and we
came prepared to make a case,'' Holt recalled in a telephone
interview. ``But when he came in, he apparently had decided against
some of his advisers, and he said he wanted to do it.''
   Supporters of the legislation had argued that the Veterans
Administration already has the fifth-largest budget among federal
agencies and merits being put on par with other Cabinet departments.
   There are some 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or
survivors, although only about 2.5 to 3 million of them rely on
Veterans Administration services on a regular basis. The agency has
a $30 billion budget, and it will disburse $14 billion in income
maintenance and $626 million for education and rehabilitation
assistance this year.
   Reagan said the bill gives veterans ``what they have deserved so
long _ a seat at the table of our national affairs.''
   Flanked by leaders of congressional committees on military
affairs, and accompanied by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and
Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he said:
``I've said before that America's debt to those who would fight for
her defense doesn't end the day the uniform comes off. For the
security of our nation, it must not end.''
   The House and Senate, paying election-year homage to veterans,
had both given overwhelming approval to the bill. Among other
things, it will place a secretary of veterans affairs on the
Cabinet, create the position of deputy secretary and as many as a
half-dozen assistant secretaries.
   ``I don't expect that it is going to produce any miracles,'' said
H.F. ``Sparky'' Gierke, national commander of the American Legion.
``It's not going to be an overnight change.''
   Gierke said that despite the creation of a larger agency, with
another layer of high-ranking assistants, the measure would not
consign veterans problems to a mammoth bureaucracy. ``We hope it
will run more efficiently,'' he said.
   ``The vast majority of veterans do not get compensation from the
VA and the vast majority of veterans do not use its health care
facilities,'' said Mary Stout, president of the Vietnam Veterans of
America. ``But we think there are a lot of problems for the people
who have to rely on these services ... and we did support the
elevation of the agency.''
   Ms. Stout, a Vietnam veteran, said she hoped any additional clout
enjoyed by a secretary of veterans affairs would help those seeking
compensation from the government for illnesses they say are
connected to the spraying of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange in
Vietnam.
   ``It's not so much giving more voice as it is, we hope, giving
more accountability'' for the administration of veterans programs,
she said.
   Holt said ``we're delighted. This has really been a priority goal
for a long time.''
   Spokesmen for the veterans organizations said they hoped to use
the new Cabinet seat as a bully pulpit from which they can combat
continuing pressure for cuts in veterans benefits as well as other
domestic programs.

   The Communist Party admitted Tuesday that its
3-year-old anti-alcoholism campaign has created long lines at liquor
stores and led to a moonshining business that has left sugar and
candy in short supply.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the party's policy-making
Central Committee adopted a resolution reviewing President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's drive to sober up this nation of 284 million people.
   None of the Soviet media said when the resolution was approved.
   According to Tass, the resolution said the campaign has reduced
drinking on the job and in public places, improved family life and
cut alcohol-related crime.
   But it added that ``radical changes have not yet been achieved.''
   Sugar and candy shortages developed as moonshiners hoarded sugar
to make what they call in Russian ``samogon.''
   The anti-alcoholism campaign has caused nationwide disgruntlement
and rationing of sugar in many areas.
   Radio Moscow said the ``rush to curtail sales'' of alcohol led to
profiteering, poisonings and drug addiction.
   The Soviet press has been full of reports of these problems but
the resolution was one of the frankest official admissions of the
program's faults.
   While saying drunkenness must still be fought vigorously, the
Central Committee ordered ministries to ``stamp out alcoholic
queues,'' according to Radio Moscow.
   Lines stretching for blocks are common at liquor stores and other
shops where alcohol is sold throughout the Soviet Union.
   The reports did not say how the long lines would be eliminated
but said alcohol sales would not be permitted near schools,
factories, recreation areas or on public transport.
   The Trud labor daily said on Oct. 6 that the Kremlin plans next
year to produce more beer, wine, cognac and champagne to meet
popular demand. It said vodka and other strong drinks would continue
to be manufactured in limited quantities.
   In May 1985, Gorbachev ordered a cut in production of alcoholic
beverages, an increase in their price, an increase in the minimum
drinking age to 21 and cuts in the hours and number of stores that
could sell the products.

   The Energy Department should value its planned
sale of a synthetic gas plant in North Dakota as worth $200 million
instead of the $600 million figure it has advertised, according to
congressional auditors.
   Even so, the sale of the Great Plains coal gasification plant
near Beulah, N.D., will still yield more than the government could
expect by operating it over the next 21 years, said analysts from
the General Accounting Office.
   In a report dated Oct. 21 and received Tuesday, GAO analysts said
the Energy Department should not count about $300 million in tax
credits that the prospective buyer, Basin Electric Power
Cooperative, has agreed to forgo.
   Bob Porter, an Energy Department spokesman, said the department
had not seen the GAO report but as a general matter believes it is
legitimate to count the value of the tax credits that will not be
used.
   ``That's cash the government would not have had; that's quite
legitimate,'' Porter said.
   Using figures to calculate the loss of future income from the
sale of the plant's gas at prices forecast by the Energy Department,
GAO calculated the sale as yielding the equivalent of $203 million
to the government.
   That is midway between the respective $284 million and $128
million figures that two consultants, Wharton Econometrics and Data
Resources Inc., calculated using their forecasts of future energy
prices.
   The value to the government of the future revenues under
government ownership would be $166 million using department
projections, $230 million using Data Resources' estimates and a loss
of $54 million using Wharton's estimates, GAO said.
   The plant cost $2.1 billion to build and was a technical success
at turning lignite into pipeline-quality gas. Its builders, though,
defaulted on $1.5 billion in government guaranteed loans, leaving
the Energy Department to pay off the loans and take over the plant.

   Wall Street bankers who buy ``cocaine on
their lunch break'' should be punished along with drug dealers,
smugglers and Colombian narcotics barons, Nancy Reagan said Tuesday.
   The U.S. first lady told a U.N. committee on social affairs the
United States is responsible for its own drug problem and every
American drug user ``is an accomplice to every criminal act, every
murder, every terrorist attack carried out by the narcotics
syndicates.''
   ``To get serious about stopping illegal drugs ... that means
confronting all those citizens who use drugs,'' Mrs. Reagan said,
and if the United States cannot conquer the demand for narcotics
there is little hope of halting production and smuggling.
   Her advice to all drug users, from poor children to affluent
adults both here and abroad, was ``Just Say `No','' the slogan of
the anti-drug program she sponsors.
   ``It is often easier to make strong speeches about foreign drug
lords or drug smugglers than to arrest a pair of Wall Street
investment bankers buying cocaine on their lunch break,'' she said
in her address to the U.N. Third Committee on Social and
Humanitarian Affairs.
   During his eight years in office, President Reagan has advocated
a war on drug producers in Latin America and elsewhere, along with
interdiction of drugs being smuggled into the United States.
   His wife said Tuesday stopping drug use in the United States is
as important as halting the production and smuggling of illegal
narcotics.
   ``While most of the illegal drugs are imported, the drug users
are home-grown,'' she said.
   ``If we lack the will to fully mobilize the forces of law in our
own country to arrest and punish drug users, if we cannot stem the
American demand for drugs, then there will be little hope of
preventing foreign drug producers from fulfilling that demand.
   ``Drugs must remain illegal at every step in the chain.''

<HEAD>New Ads for Dukakis, Bush; Live TV for Dukakis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs lead and 5th graf, subbing ``misled'' for lying to
reflect actual words of ad</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush unveiled a new ad
Tuesday accusing Democrat Michael Dukakis of deliberately misleading
viewers in the last debate, while Dukakis readied a wave of
Populist-flavored spots telling voters he's ``on your side.''
   Dukakis also lined up two more network TV interviews in his quest
for wider exposure with two weeks left in the campaign.
   The hard-hitting Bush spot focusing on pensions follows Dukakis'
assertions in TV ads and on the stump that Bush is lying about and
distorting his record as Massachusetts governor.
   The Bush ad was shown at a news conference beamed by satellite to
television stations across the country. Campaign aides said they
didn't know when or where it might be aired except on news programs
that picked up Tuesday's event.
   It says Dukakis ``deliberately misled'' 62 million viewers in the
Oct. 13 debate when he denied taking $27 million from the state
pension fund to balance his state's budget. It shows a debate clip
of Dukakis angrily rejecting the charge and quotes the Wall Street
Journal as saying ``it is indisputable'' that Dukakis shifted the
money.
   ``And Michael Dukakis says George Bush is running a campaign of
lies?'' a narrator asks. ``Michael Dukakis is unbelievable.''
   Dukakis and Bush each are running a mix of positive and attack
ads concentrated in California, Texas, Ohio and other battleground
states.
   The four new Dukakis ads combine a ``Dukakis is on your side''
motif with the tagline ``Dukakis-Bentsen: The best America is yet to
come.'' Spokeswoman Lorraine Voles said the ads would start Thursday
in various locations around the country.
   One ad shows children on a playground and says, ``Imagine a place
where children come out to play without fear of drugs or drug
dealers. Is that too much to expect? As president, Michael Dukakis
will be on your side. He'll declare a real war on drugs. Double the
number of drug agents and slash aid to countries that allow drug
traffic.''
   Another spot shows a supermarket checkout counter and asks
viewers to ``imagine a place where families don't have to stretch
two paychecks for the life one paycheck used to bring. Is that too
much to expect? As president, Michael Dukakis will be on your side.
He's committed to giving earning power back to the American worker.''
   The other two focus on the elderly _ ``To those who would cut
Social Security, he'll say never. And he'll back full cost-of-living
adjustments'' _ and on jobs _ ``He'll forge a partnership of
business, labor and government to take on the toughest foreign
competition and make America number one again.''
   Dukakis, lagging in the polls, also is trying keep a high profile
through television interviews, and an aide said Tuesday he would be
appearing on the CBS and NBC evening newscasts.
   Spokesman Dayton Duncan said Dukakis would be interviewed live on
the CBS Evening News Thursday night, a day after his vice
presidential running mate Lloyd Bentsen appears on the same program.
   In addition, Duncan said, Dukakis will be interviewed Friday for
one in a series of reports NBC is airing next week on the
candidates' stands on selected issues. Dukakis also will be
interviewed for a Fox Television network show to be broadcast Nov.
6, two days before the election.
   Since adopting his go-for-broke media strategy, Dukakis has
appeared on the three network morning programs, a nationally
televised cable interview show and Tuesday night on ABC's
``Nightline.''
   He also bought four five-minute prime-time slots for a paid
advertisement that aired Saturday night on ABC. It was scheduled for
repeats on various networks on Tuesday night, on Nov. 1 and on Nov.
5. Each airing costs the campaign between $125,000 and $175,000.
   In the five-minute ad, Dukakis accuses Bush of running a campaign
of ``fear and of smear'' and pledges to fight for Main Street
Americans.
   Bush had a stormy nine-minute confrontation with Dan Rather on
the CBS news last Jan. 25 early in the primary season. Rather will
also interview Dukakis. Bush turned down a ``Nightline'' invitation
to appear with Dukakis, but is considering interview requests from
other news and talk shows.
   ``We're giving serious consideration to a few of them,'' said
Bush spokesman Mark Goodin. ``We will end up doing several. How many
I don't know. It's a question of whether we can get to them.''

<HEAD>Adams To Campaign Little in Light of Sexual Assault Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Brock Adams, who was accused by an aide
of sexually assaulting her, was back on the campaign trail for
fellow Democrats Tuesday, but is limiting appearances so he doesn't
hurt their chances, an assistant said.
   ``We are aware there are people out there who want to exploit the
situation and we don't want to play into their hands,'' said Steve
Elmendorf, Adams' executive assistant.
   Prosecutors have declined to charge Adams, D-Wash., with any
crimes because of a lack of physical evidence and problems with the
credibility of Kari Tupper, 26, the woman who accused him, police
records have shown.
   Tupper, a former secretary for the House Aging Committee who now
lives in Seattle, claimed that Adams drugged her by putting
something in her drink at his home on March 27, 1987, and then took
her to bed.
   Adams accused Ms. Tupper, whose parents had been close friends of
his, of trying to blackmail him for $400,000 in ``hush money.''
Adams denied making any sexual advances, but said he made a mistake
letting the woman stay at his home.
   Elmendorf said no candidates have asked Adams to stay away, but
that Adams doesn't want to put them in an uncomfortable situation.
   ``Brock is realistic and he knows what the situation is,'' said
Elmendorf. ``His overriding interest is to elect Democrats from one
end of the ticket to the other, and to allow extraneous side issues
to become part of the campaign is in no one's interest. We won't let
it happen.''
   Adams has declined to join a six-city tour planned by Democratic
candidates.
   Adams, who was transportation secretary under President Carter,
in 1986 unseated Republican Slade Gorton, who is making a comeback
bid for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Dan Evans.
Gorton's race against Rep. Mike Lowry is one of the closest in the
country, according to recent polls.

   Leftist guerrillas dynamited a bus
carrying police and election officials in the remote Andes mountains
of northwest Colombia Tuesday, killing 13 people and wounding 14,
officials reported.
   The casualties brought to 51 the number of people killed in
guerrilla attacks since Sunday night.
   An added blow to the government was the collapse of negotiations
aimed at averting a one-day general strike set for Thursday.
   The Simon Bolivar Front, an umbrella group for all six leftist
rebel factions in Colombia, urged President Virgilio Barco to start
peace talks with the guerrillas.
   Cesar Gaviria, minister of government, issued a statement Tuesday
said the proposal was made in a message sent to the president a day
earlier.
   Guerrillas, who support the strike call, blew up the bus Tuesday
morning near Peque, a town of 7,000 people about 200 miles northwest
of the capital of Bogota.
   The guerrillas set off dynamite in the road as the bus was going
by, the army's 4th Brigade said in a communique from its
headquarters in Medellin.
   An election for mayor was held last Sunday in Peque. The police
had been guarding the town against guerrilla attack and the election
officials had supervised voting there.
   Results of the election were not yet known.
   The military communique said nine policemen and four civilian
election officials were killed and 12 policemen and two election
officials wounded in the dynamating.
   Talks broke off Monday between labor unions and government
officials. Little hope was seen of avoiding the general strike,
Gaviria said in the statement.
   The unions want pay increases, a price freeze and an end to death
squad attacks that have killed 180 union members in the last two
years.
   The unions are the Workers' Unitary Central, the General
Confederation of Labor and the Colombian Confederation of Workers.
   The unions, with about 800,000 members, represent about 10
percent of the work force in this nation of 30 million people.
   All schools and many businesses and transport companies close
during general strikes in fear of violence.
   The Defense Ministry said last week it discovered guerrilla plans
to provoke violence during the strike.
   Guerrillas in a speeding car threw a bomb Tuesday at the offices
of a bus company in Medellin, but no one was hurt, a national police
communique said.

   A record-breaking year in gifts to
Smith College bears out a study that found alumnae of women's
schools give more to their alma maters than graduates of
coeducational schools, fund-raisers said Tuesday.
   Graduates of the elite school gave $17.1 million in donations in
fiscal 1987. Together with donations from friends, parents,
corporations and foundations, Smith received $28 million for the
year.
   The gifts are a record for a women's college and the envy of
other schools.
   ``I applaud them,'' said Jeff Bradley, senior writer in
development at Harvard University's undergraduate college, which
last year received $27.8 million from its 20,400 pre-1976 graduates.
   But it was no surprise to another of the prestigious Seven
Sisters schools, Mount Holyoke in South Hadley, which received $18
million from its 24,000 alumnae and other donors in fiscal 1987.
   Mount Holyoke was rated 11th in the nation last year in the
percentage of graduates _ 58.6 _ who give donations. The percentage
of alumnae who gave to Smith in fiscal 1987 was not available.
   ``People have always said: `Women will not give. They cannot
give. It's a man's decision where the money goes,''' said Eileen
Elliott, director of annual giving at Mount Holyoke. ``But women
realize the value of their education and are giving back to provide
the same standard of excellence for the future.''
   A recent study by the Women's College Coalition of Washington,
D.C., a private, non-profit group representing 70 schools, found
that graduates of women's colleges are nearly twice as likely to
give to their schools as are men and women graduates of
coeducational schools.
   In 1986-87, almost 40 percent of women who attended single-sex
colleges contributed to their alma maters, the study said.
   It also found that the gifts of alumnae of women's colleges are
an average 26 percent larger than those to other colleges.
   The study looked at fund raising at 51 women's colleges and 354
private coeducational colleges as reported to the Council for Aid to
Education, which releases an annual report on voluntary support of
education. The fiscal years studied were 1976-77, 1981-82 and
1986-87.
   Mary Huchette, associate director of the coalition, said
graduates of women's colleges generally earn more than women who
attend coeducational institutions, which may account in part for the
higher level of giving. Another factor may be effective fund raising
by the women's colleges.
   Women also have more say over the disposition of individual and
family wealth than in the past, Huchette said.

<HEAD>Bush Says Dukakis Fans Class Conflict; Dukakis ``Just Working
Hard''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 7th graf, A survey..., to CORRECT when Gallup survey
taken.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>

   George Bush strove Tuesday to maintain a hefty lead in the polls,
charging that Michael Dukakis is appealing to ``division, fear and
envy'' in his comeback bid. Said Dukakis, ``We're just working hard
and we're going to win.''
   The two rivals clashed in commericals and campaign rhetoric as
fresh nationwide surveys rated Bush the double-digit leader two
weeks before Election Day.
   The vice president said in Ohio that Dukakis was an advocate for
economic policies ``far outside the mainstream,'' policies that
resemble European socialism more than American free enterprise. And
his aides previewed a television commercial accusing the Democratic
presidential candidate of deliberately misleading voters about his
record as governor.
   Dukakis renewed his own complaints about Republican ads as he
campaigned on the ground in California and on television through
commercials and a 90-minute appearance on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   ``Now they've got a tank ad _ has all kinds of misstatements and
outright falsehoods,'' Dukakis said. ``We Democrats are for a strong
defense.''
   Democratic running mate Lloyd Bentsen added his voice. He said
that in their ads, Republicans accuse Dukakis of opposing the
Stealth bomber and the Pershing II missile. ``And that's a lie and
they know it,'' he said.
   A survey by CBS and the New York Times gave Bush a 54-41 lead
among probable voters. The Gallup Organization had the race at 53-39
among likely voters in calls made Friday through Sunday. Both
surveys had margins of potential sampling error of plus or minus
three percentage points.
   The surveys indicated Bush has solidified his advantage in the
two weeks since the last presidential debate.
   But even before the surveys were released, Dukakis aides were
busy trying to cast doubt on the results. These aides, speaking on
condition they not be identified, said internal campaign polling
showed a six-point lead for the Republican ticket, down from 10
points last week. They said Dukakis' recent Populist-style rhetoric
and allegations of Republican campaign lies were scoring points.
   Spokesman Dayton Duncan added, ``Our polling shows by an
overwhelming margin people are blaming Bush for this negative
campaign.''
   The campaign air war was relentless.
   Bush's aides previewed a commercial saying Dukakis ``deliberately
misled'' debate viewers when he denied that he'd taken money from
the Massachusetts pension fund to help balance the state budget.
   ``And Michael Dukakis says George Bush is running a campaign of
lies?'' a narrator asks. ``Michael Dukakis is unbelievable.''
   Dukakis countered with a series of four commercials showing
himself and Bentsen and asking viewers to imagine a better America.
``As president, Michael Dukakis will be on your side,'' says the
narrator.
   Bush dispatched surrogates to rebut Democratic charges of unfair
campaign tactics.
   Among them was vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, who said
desperate Democrats were dishing out ``political sludge'' with
Dukakis' active encouragement. He branded the entire operation
``despicable'' and said Bush was a man of ``unshakable integrity and
fairness.''
   Bush sought personally to deflect Democratic charges that he
stood for the wealthy at the expense of the less well off.
   ``We will move forward not by succumbing to the base temptations
of division, fear and envy, but by following, as Abraham Lincoln
said, those better angels of our nature,'' he told a breakfast in
Columbus.
   Bush said Dukakis had been making ``increasing appeals to class
conflict,'' and said that in his view there was ``no place in
American life for philosophies that divide Americans one from
another along class lines and that excite conflict among them.''
   The vice president charged his Democratic rival was ``far outside
the mainstream of economic thinking and he's broken with the
American tradition of entrepreneurship and free enterprise.''
   The GOP nominee said Dukakis favors an industrial policy of
control that has been tried and rejected as unsuccessful in Europe.
``Around the world, governments are abandoning socialism, moving
away from socialistic, high control experience ... and embracing the
American model of low taxation, entrepreneurship and individual
intitative.''
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, asked if the vice president
was calling Dukakis a socialist, said, ``That would be going too
far.''
   Campaign surrogates were making their customary rounds.
   Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole was in Pennsylvania, predicting a
Republican victory and taunting Dukakis that he deserved a ``Rip Van
Winkle'' award. ``He just sort of went to sleep there for about six
or eight weeks and when he woke up the election was over,'' said
Dole, who lost out to Bush in the springtime race for the GOP
presidential nomination.
   Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas agreed that Dukakis made
a mistake by failing to respond to Bush's attacks for weeks at a
time. He disagreed with Dole that the race was over, praised the
Democrat's latest round of television commercials and said, ``I
would have done it eight weeks ago.''
   Dukakis began airing a series of television commercials last
weekend that charged the Bush campaign with distortions and lies.
   His campaign also purchased time for a five-minute paid
advertisement on NBC late Tuesday night that duplicated a commercial
aired Saturday night on ABC. In it, Dukakis accused Bush of running
a campaign of ``fear and of smear'' and pledged to fight for Main
Street Americans.

   Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government
claimed that 69 American and ``Arabian'' advisers were killed
Tuesday as they helped Islamic guerrillas in the eastern part of the
country.
   A half-hour later, it lowered the number to six.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Islamabad called the reports
``unbelievable'' and ``ridiculous.''
   The official Afghan radio also announced that Kabul authorities
decided to release two West German medical personnel _ Dr. Benno
Spliet and nurse Lea Hochstalt _ captured on Sept. 8 after treating
civilian war wounded.
   The radio said in its main 7:30 p.m. newscast that government
security forces inflicted heavy losses on ``criminals,'' its term
for Mujahedeen fighters, in Paktia province which borders Pakistan.
   It said it received a report Tuesday that 43 ``criminals'' were
killed and 24 wounded.
   ``The report adds that 69 American and Arabian advisers who had a
direct hand in the criminals' activities and are helping the
criminals also were killed today,'' according to the broadcast.
   In the next broadcast a half-hour later, it revised the number to
six without explanation.
   It did not specify the nationality of the Arabs. Afghanistan's
official news media began claiming the death and capture of
Americans in Afghan territory on Oct. 16.
   The United States, which backs the Mujahedeen, denies it has any
U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan.
   ``No, I wouldn't believe the reports at all,'' said an embassy
spokesman, speaking on condition his name not be used. ``It's
unbelievable. It's a ridiculous allegation.''
   U.S. and other Western diplomats said earlier Tuesday that the
communists' claims of killing and capturing U.S. advisers was false
propaganda aimed at inflating the communists' image.
   Afghanistan's official news agency, Bakhtar, and national
television reported three ``American advisers'' were killed and four
captured inside the country between Oct. 16-22. The Soviet news
agency Tass ran the stories later.
   U.S. embassies in Kabul and Islamabad challenged the Afghans for
proof.
   ``Since there are no U.S. advisers whatsoever in Afghanistan, all
of these stories are fabrications,'' the embassy in Islamabad stated
Tuesday.
   U.S. arming and training of Mujahedeen guerrillas on Pakistani
soil is well documented but Washington refuses to discuss details.
It has always denied the presence of U.S. military personnel in
Afghanistan itself.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
series of Afghan reports appeared to be propaganda from a government
whose security is treatened by increasing rebel pressure.
   About half of more than 100,000 Soviet troops withdrew from
Afghanistan between May 15 and Aug. 15 under a U.N.-sponsored accord
signed last April. The rest are to be out by next Feb. 15.
   Mujahedeen claimed the capture of five of about 30 provincial
capitals since May and the siege of others. Kabul suffers rocket
attacks almost daily.
   Najib, head of state and leader of the ruling People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan, has issued repeated appeals for peace talks
and national reconciliation.

<TEXT>
   Egypt and France held their second summit
in less than a month Tuesday and discussed the Palestinian problem,
but President Francois Mitterrand of France was noncommittal on an
independent state.
   Egypt's official Middle East News Agency carried some of the
comments Mitterrand and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made to
reporters before the French leader left for home. Mitterrand arrived
earlier in the day.
   Asked whether France would accept the idea of a Palestinian state
based on U.N. Resolution 181, Mitterrand replied: ``I think we
should know much more about this subject before making statements.''
   Mubarak cautioned leaders of the Palestine Liberation
Organization against concentrating on Resolution 181 as the key to
legitimatizing a Palestinian state established in Israeli-occupied
Arab territories.
   ``If we talk about Resolution 181, and we concentrate on it only,
this will arouse Israeli suspicion,'' he said, and added about any
such state: ``We must know the borders, or else the Israelis will
fear that it is a state engulfing the whole of Israel and matters
will get more complicated.''
   Resolution 181, passed in 1947 by the General Assembly, called
for division of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states and the
internationalization of Jeruslaem. Israel was created in 1948.
   Yasser Arafat's PLO has been studying possible plans for the
future of Palestinians, including three choices: declaration of an
independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories,
declaration of a provisional government or a combination of the two.
   Israel captured West Bank and Gaza Strip, now home to about 1.5
million Palestinians, from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war. Egypt, the only Arab nation ever to do so, signed a peace
treaty with Israel in 1979.
   Mubarak and Mitterrand last conferred in Paris on Sept. 27,
during a European tour by the Egyptian president that included
visits to Britain, West Germany and Yugoslavia.

   Lisa Steinberg, the 6-year-old whose death last
year elicited an outpouring of grief and rage, was a murder victim,
brutally battered by the only father she ever knew, a prosecutor
charged Tuesday.
   Joel Steinberg ``beat Lisa so severely that he inflicted those
injures which caused her death,'' said Assistant District Attorney
Peter Casolaro in a 30-minute statement at the start of Steinberg's
murder trial. ``We expect to show by the evidence that he killed
that child,''
   Casolaro told the panel ``graphic and grotesque'' evidence and
testimony will prove Steinberg murdered Lisa, who was found
unconscious in the Steinberg apartment early Nov. 2, 1987, and died
of her injuries three days later.
   The prosecutor told the jury the first-grader had bruises on her
chest, legs, arms and neck, along with head injuries caused by
``blunt-force trauma,'' when she arrived at the hospital that
morning. Police officers there noticed Steinberg's wounded, bleeding
knuckles, he said.
   As Casolaro detailed the child's injuries, Lisa's biological
mother, Michele Launders, sat crying in the front row of the
courtroom.
   Steinberg, 47, once a respected millionaire defense lawyer, is
charged with second-degree murder in the death of the child he
adopted illegally at birth from Ms. Launders, then an unmarried
teen-ager. He has denied ever hitting Lisa.
   Steinberg's attorney, Ira London, urging the jury to concentrate
on the facts and not his client's morality, maintained in his
10-minute argument that the evidence in the much-anticipated trial
will not support a murder charge.
   He called on the jury to acquit Steinberg based on the evidence
and launched an attack on Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's longtime
live-in companion, who was called ``the single most important
witness in this case'' by trial judge Harold Rothwax.
   ``It will not be proven in this case that Lisa Steinberg was
murdered, nor will it be proven that Lisa was a battered child,''
London told the jury. ``Lisa was neither sullen or withdrawn. She
was a vital, active and engaging child until her death.''
   In an effort to undercut Ms. Nussbaum's expected testimony,
London called her ``delusional,'' mentioned she had spent the last
year in a psychiatric hospital and alluded to her ``self-destructive
romance with Satanic cults'' and sado-masochistic behavior.
   Casolaro painted Ms. Nussbaum as a victim of Steinberg as well:
``He exploited her weakness of mind and her emotional problems. The
defendant beat and broke Miss Nussbaum until she had become nothing
more than his willing servant.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, has a cooperation agreement with the Manhattan
district attorney's office to testify, although she has told
prosecutors she did not see Steinberg strike Lisa the day she fell
unconscious.
   She was charged along with Steinberg in Lisa's death, but was
never indicted and the charges will probably be dropped, the
district attorney's office said. After her arrest, she underwent
surgery and psychiatric treatment for injuries allegedly inflicted
by Steinberg.
   The trial is expected to last four to eight weeks.
   Following opening arguments, Police Officer James Botte _ the
first person to arrive at the Steinberg apartment and see the
unconscious girl _ testified the home was dirty, unkempt and dark
when he arrived.
   His testimony was corroborated by the next witness, paramedic
John Filangeri, who added that when he asked Steinberg to bring a
lamp into the room, the defendant replied, ``Is that really
important?''
   Filangeri also testified that Ms. Nussbaum answered the front
door when he arrived at the apartment, and described her battered
condition.
   ``She appeared to be 70 to 80 years of age. She had numerous
facial injuries, some old, some new,'' Filangeri recalled. ``She had
gray hair and was stooped.''
   Lisa's 16-month-old brother, Mitchell, was found in the apartment
sitting in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen, authorities
have said. The boy was also illegally adopted, and now lives with
his birth mother.
   In Steinberg's version of what happened the night of Nov. 1,
1987, Lisa became sick after eating and the bruises on her back and
chest resulted from his efforts to revive her after she fell
unconscious in their home.
   No help was called for Lisa until after 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 2,
court records show. Lisa was pronounced brain dead on Nov. 5.
   The slaying of the girl drew national attention and produced a
city-wide outpouring of grief for the girl and rage against
Steinberg. The doorway of her Greenwich Village home was turned into
a virtual shrine, filled with flowers, gifts and poems from people
who never knew Lisa.
   Her wake and funeral drew tremendous crowds of strangers, many of
them with tears in their eyes. Groups which support battered
children seized on Lisa as a martyr whose death symbolized the
plight of abused children across the country.

   The chief witness against Bess Myerson admitted
Tuesday that there were numerous differences between her previous
sworn statements and what she has told the jury at the former Miss
America's divorce-fixing trial.
   Miss Myerson's attorney got Sukhreet Gabel to concede that 10
things she told the jury last week about a conversation she had with
Miss Myerson in 1986 were not in a detailed memo she wrote shortly
after the meeting.
   Ms. Gabel is the daughter of former state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel, 75, who is on trial with Miss Myerson, 64, and Miss
Myerson's boyfriend, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43.
   They are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and bribe-related
charges.
   In later testimony, Ms. Gabel said her mother once described Miss
Myerson as ``a delightful cuckoo.''
   Miss Myerson, once the city's cultural affairs commissioner, is
accused of giving Ms. Gabel, 39, a $19,000-a-year city job to
influence her mother's decisions in Capasso's divorce.
   Under questioning by the prosecution last week, Ms. Gabel
testified that while a grand jury was investigating the
circumstances of how she got her job, Miss Myerson appeared at her
apartment, invited her for a walk and told her: ``Keep your mouth
shut.''
   Prosecutors charge that Miss Myerson obstructed justice in
allegedly trying to keep Ms. Gabel from testifying truthfully to the
grand jury.
   But Myerson attorney Frederick Hafetz underscored numerous
inconsistencies in Ms. Gabel's most damaging testimony against Miss
Myerson.
   In a sworn statement she gave last year, Ms. Gabel, who left the
Department of Cultural Affairs in 1984, said Miss Myerson's
appearance at her apartment on June 18, 1986, was ``out of the
blue'' and added: ``I didn't want to have anything to do with her.''
   But Hafetz noted that a week before the night Ms. Gabel said she
talked with her old boss, she had written Miss Myerson seeking a
recommendation to law school.
   When Hafetz asked if that was a change from her testimony that
she didn't want to have anything to do with Miss Myerson, the
witness said, ``No,'' and then blurted out, ``I would characterize
it as politics makes strange bedfellows.''
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan warned Ms. Gabel against
volunteering information under oath.
   ``Stop volunteering answers,'' he lectured. ``If you do it one
more time, I'm going to get a little angry. Now stop it!''
   Hafetz also got Ms. Gabel to admit that she wrote a detailed memo
to her lawyer shortly after the alleged walk and talk with Miss
Myerson but 10 of the statements she attributed to Miss Myerson in
her trial testimony such as: ``You can make a lot of trouble;''
``We've got to get our stories straight,'' and ``You've got to keep
your mouth shut'' were not included in the memo.
   At the time she submitted the memo, Ms. Gabel conceded, she told
her lawyer that she had not ``left out anything substantive.''
   And Ms. Gabel admitted that in an interview with defense lawyers
before the trial she said, ``There was no attempt by Miss Myerson to
subvert governmental processes'' and agreed that Miss Myerson did
not ask her to change her memory.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy band played ``God Bless
America'' and sailors from the frigate USS Simpson marched in review
Tuesday as Grenadians celebrated the fifth anniversary of a U.S.
invasion that ousted a Marxist junta.
   Navy Secretary William Ball III and other U.S. officials joined a
crowd of about 1,500 for a military parade in the Queen's Park
sports stadium to mark the invasion. Oct. 25 is now known as
Thanksgiving Day on the island and is a national holiday.
   The American marchers were joined by Grenada's police force and
coast guard. A police unit marched in a formation that made the
number 5, for the anniversary.
   A message from Presdident Reagan read by Ball said Grenada had
made major progress since 1983, paid tribute to the 19 American
servicemen killed in the invasion of the nation twice the size of
Washington, D.C., and declared: ``The Grenada that we know today, a
free, peaceful country, is the best confirmation that those lives
were not lost in vain.''
   The United States, joined by seven Eastern Caribbean nations that
provided token forces, sent 6,000 Marines and paratroopers to
Grenada to expel a Marxist military junta that had seized power in a
coup.
   Six days earlier, soldiers had executed Prime Minister Maurice
Bishop and 10 other officials of his leftist government, killed
scores of bystanders with mortars and automatic weapons and placed
the country under 24-hour curfew.
   Bishop was overthrown as a result of factional feuding within his
government.
   It was the first U.S. military intervention in the Caribbean in
two decades and was widely criticized abroad as a violation of
Grenada's sovereignty.
   The Reagan administration said the invasion was mounted at the
request of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, which
feared Cuba would use Grenada as a staging area communist aggression
in the region. Cuba denied any aggressive aims in Grenada.
   Grenada's 94,100 residents generally regard the invasion, which
the Reagan administration called a ``rescue mission,'' as a
liberation from repression and near-anarchy.
   In a speech Tuesday, Prime Minister Herbert Blaize chided
Grenadians ``who were on their knees in 1983'' but had forgotten
``the deliverance that God had worked for them.''
   ``It was God who sent the Americans and Caribbean forces to
deliver them,'' Blaize said.
   Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica, one of the Caribbean
leaders supporting the invasion, said it was undertaken to restore
democracy and order and to safeguard U.S. citizens on the island,
but above all was necessary ``to save our own skins.''
   A memorial service was held at the St. George's University School
of Medicine on Grand Anse Beach, where 480 American students were
evacuated by helicopter.
   A bronze monument on the campus bears the names of the 19 U.S.
servicemen who died in the operation. Forty-four Grenadians and 24
Cubans also were killed.
   Since the invasion, the United States has poured $110 million
into Grenada to finish an international airport started by Cuba,
pave hundreds of miles of potholed roads and improve electricity,
telephone and water systems.
   Parliamentary democracy is well-established and tourism has
improved, but not to the extent expected just after the invasion.
   A hoped-for flood of U.S. investment has not materialized and the
island's economy, based on agriculture, continues to struggle.
   Other Americans at the ceremony included Vice Adm. Joseph
Metcalf, commander of the invasion; Maj. Gen. Robert Milligan, chief
of U.S. armed forces in the Caribbean; Richard H. Melton, deputy
assistant secretary of state for the Caribbean; and Ford Cooper,
charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators on Tuesday blamed a quick
turn during takeoff for the crash of an AVAir commuter plane last
February at Raleigh-Durham, N.C., airport.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said the pilot of the
aircraft maneuvered too sharply at low altitude, resulting in the
loss of control and crash that killed 12 people on board.
   The AVAir commuter plane, flying as American Eagle Flight 378,
crashed shortly after it departed the airport in dense fog on Feb.
19, l988, landing in a wooded area about a mile from the runway.
   The Fairchild Metro III commuter was bound for Richmond, Va.,
with 10 passengers, a pilot and a co-pilot.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said the probable cause
for the accident was ``the failure of the flight crew to maintain a
proper flight path due to the first officer's inappropriate
instrument scan, the captain's inadequate monitoring of the flight
and the flight crew's response to a fault in the airplane's stall
avoidance system.''
   The investigation revealed that the co-pilot, Kathleen Digan, 28,
who had been hired by AVAir in May 1987, had a spotty training
record and on a number of occasions had been the subject of poor
evaluations by various AVAir captains.
   In September 1987, another AVAir captain reported in an
evaluation that Ms. Digan had problems in climb, cruise, descent and
landing maneuvers. Two months before that, another captain wrote
AVAir's operations director on hotel stationery that he considered
Ms. Digan's performance in landing his airplane ``unacceptable'' and
that on their trip she had trouble with eight of 10 landings.
   The NTSB criticized AVAir, which no longer operates commuter
flights, for not acting sooner to deal with Ms. Digan's flying
problems. It also said the FAA's failure to monitor adequately
AVAir's financial and operational problems was a contributing factor
to the Feb. 19 accident.
   AVAir, which since l985 had a marketing agreement with American
Airlines, underwent rapid growth in l987 after American expanded its
hub operation at Raleigh-Durham. It hired 123 pilots in the second
quarter of l987 alone and by l988, about 60 percent of its pilots
had less than a year with the company.
   But AVAir began having financial problems in late l987, filed for
protection under the bankruptcy laws on Jan. 15, l988 and ceased
operation, only to resume flights on Feb. 3, about two weeks before
the crash. Last May, AVAir sold its commuter operations to American
Airlines which continues to fly those operations under the name
American Eagle.
   Investigators determined that Ms. Digan was at the controls when
the Metro III commuter plane departed Raleigh-Durham on Feb. 19,
although there was evidence that the captain, Walter Cole, 38,
attempted to help keep the aircraft aloft in the final seconds.
   Flight 378 had been told by air traffic control to bank to the
right as soon as possible after takeoff because of the heavy traffic
loads at the time of the departure, investigators said.
   But Ms. Digan, the investigation concluded, banked the aircraft
too sharply and at too low an altitude _ about a 40 degree bank only
200 feet off the ground, or nearly twice as sharp as would have been
advised.
   The plane was relying on instruments because of the heavy fog and
the NTSB concluded that if the pilots had scanned their instruments
adequately they would have known their bank was too sharp and at too
low an altitude.
   The NTSB report said the pilots also might have been distracted
by a light indicating that the aircraft's stall warning system had
activated. The system automatically forces the nose down if the
aircraft is approaching a stall situation.
   But, according to the investigation, the aircraft's performance
indicated that the stall warning system actually had not deployed,
but that the problem stemmed from a false warning light.

<TEXT>
   Most of the nation enjoyed dry and seasonal weather Tuesday
except the Great Lakes region, where a cold front produced clouds,
rain and scattered snow showers.
   West and southwest winds off Lake Erie dumped almost
three-quarters of an inch of rain on Buffalo, N.Y.
   Four to 6 inches of snow fell along the western tip of Michigan
and across the border in Hurley, Wis. Snow showers also were
reported in the Grand Rapids and Muskegon areas of Michigan. Mixed
rain and snow showers occurred in northwest Pennsylvania and lower
Michigan.
   Gale warnings were in effect for lakes Erie and Ontario. Lake
snow advisories were posted for portions of western New York.
   Patches of dense fog at mid-day covered portions of the
California coast, and visibilities were below a mile in fog in the
Willamette Valley of Oregon.
   Clear skies prevailed from Virginia to Florida and Alabama. Skies
were also bright and sunny over Oklahoma, northwest Texas, New
Mexico and the desert Southwest.
   Early afternoon temperatures were in the 30s and 40s from New
York state and northern Pennsylvania across the Great Lakes region
and Minnesota to the Northern Plains.
   Readings in the 70s were posted across the Gulf Coastal states
and the lower Mississippi Valley. Readings were in the 80s in Texas
with a few locations in the lower Rio Grande Valley near 90 degrees.
Temperatures were also in the 80s to near 90 degrees in the desert
Southwest with 70s across interior valleys of California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 28
degrees at Bemidji, Minn., and Park Rapids, Minn., to 92 degrees at
Palm Springs, Calif. The low in the nation Tuesday morning was 8
degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for rain and snow showers to
continue near the Canadian border from Maine to Michigan. Widely
scattered showers were expected from the southern Appalachians to
eastern North Carolina. Showers were also forecast in Mississippi
and southern Alabama, with scattered showers and thunderstorms
across Louisiana and eastern Texas. Widely scattered showers were to
develop over the mountains of western Montana, northern Idaho and
eastern Washington.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 40s and 50s from the
northern and middle Atlantic Coastal states across the Appalachians,
the Ohio Valley, the southern Great Lakes and the middle Mississippi
Valley to North Dakota. Highs in the 30s were forecast over the
northern Great Lakes. Florida, the southern half of Texas and
interior valleys of California could expect readings in the 80s, and
temperatures from 85 to 95 degrees were predicted in the desert
Southwest.

   Grammy-winning country music singer Waylon
Jennings was hospitalized after he complained of chest pains during
a performance, and tests performed Tuesday ruled out a heart attack,
a spokeswoman said.
   ``He's strong as an ox. He's fine, resting well and in good
spirits,'' Marylou Hyatt said from Jennings' office in Nashville,
Tenn.
   ``The best news is the heart attack was ruled out,'' she said.
   Jennings became ill during the first of two performances Monday
night at a club in nearby Santa Ana, 30 miles south of downtown Los
Angeles.
   ``He was unable to perform due to chest pains and he had a hard
time breathing,'' said Dino Lint, manager of the Crazy Horse Saloon.
   Jennings was taken to the cardiac care unit at Health Care
Medical Center and later transferred to an undisclosed location.
   Jennings, whose work on 13 million-selling albums has won him two
Grammy Awards and four Country Music Association Awards, is probably
best known for his duet with Willie Nelson on ``Mamas Don't Let Your
Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys.''
   He also recorded ``Ladies Love Outlaws,'' ``Amanda'' and the
theme song for the television show ``The Dukes of Hazzard.''

   Government leaders will meet in
emergency session this week on Yugoslavia's economic crisis, Tanjug
news agency announced Tuesday.
   It said the Cabinet and nine-member collective Presidency will
meet in joint session Friday.
   Only two such meetings have been held since the Communists came
to power after World War II _ in April 1981 and November 1985.
   ``The mere fact that the Presidency has decided to convene the
joint session indicates the gravity of the situation facing our
country's economy,'' Tanjug said.
   Premier Branko Mikulic said in a recent interview that the
government will introduce ``a completely new market-oriented
economic system.''
   The plan, which could be adopted by Parliament by the end of the
year, envisages closing down all money-losing firms, the wide
introduction of both Yugoslav and foreign capital investments and
the sales of stocks and bonds.
   Yugoslavia is beset by ethnic and social unrest as well as its
worst economic crisis since World War II.
   The nation's inflation rate is running at more than 217 percent,
the highest in Europe. Yugoslavia has a $21 billion foreign debt and
a 15 percent unemployment rate.
   Labor dissatisfaction has grown worse since May, when government
austerity measures chopped wagwes and allowed substantial price
increases.
   About half of the nation's companies, employing about 2 million
workers, are losing money and layoffs could trigger more social
restivity.
   Other developments Tuesday came in the ethnic conflict involving
Montenegrins, Slavs and ethnic Albanians.
   The Parliament of the southern republic of Montenegro gave a
confidence vote to all but five members of the 20-member Cabinet
following a debate over police actions during a demonstration,
according to Radio Belgrade.
   Well informed sources said Communist Party leaders from Serbia
and Kosovo, an autonomous province in the Serbian republic, would
meet Friday in Belgrade amid demands by Kosovo's Serbs that the
entire provincial leadership be replaced.
   Ethnic Albanians form a majority in Kosovo and Serbs and
Montenegrins accuse them of harassment.
   More than 30,000 Slavs and Montenegrins have left Kosovo since
1981, when at least nine people were killed in ethnic violence.
   Yugoslavia has six republics with two autonomous provinces,
Kosovo and Vojvodina, that are part of Serbia.
   Rahman Morina, Kosovo's minister of interior, told the provincial
Parliament Tuesday that ``the security situation in Kosovo is very
grave, with worsening tendencies,'' Tanjug reported. It said he
blamed both Albanian and Serbian nationalists for ethnic tensions.
   Radio Belgrade said the Montenegrin Parliament gave a vote of
confidence to the presidency and 15 of the 20 members of the
government after a 12-hour debate on charges the government
overstepped its authority by ordering police to break up a
demonstration in Titograd, the capital of the republic.
   It said Lazar Djodic, the republic's interior secretary, was
among the five not given a vote of confidence, but did not say if
that meant he and the others would have to resign.
   Ten people were injured and 12 were arrested during rioting in
Titograd on Oct. 7 when demonstrators demanded the firing of local
and federal leaders who they blamed for economic and social problems.

   Dan Quayle told a persistent young reporter
from a children's news program he would rather she had a baby than
abort the fetus if she became pregnant through her father.
   ``That's a difficult question and one that does not have an easy
answer, but my answer would be yes,'' the Republican vice
presidential candidate told an 11-year-old reporter for ``Children's
Express'' during a bus tour of Illinois last week.
   The question-and-answer session was broadcast Tuesday on the CBS
evening news. The children's show is broadcast on public television.
   ``But don't you think it would ruin my whole life? ... It's not
even my fault and my whole life would be ruined,'' the reporter
asked.
   ``Well, I don't think that would be the case at all,'' Quayle
said. ``I think that if somebody had an unfortunate experience like
that, it would be something that you would remember the rest of your
life.
   ``The idea of a father abusing a daughter is a horrendous
situation, one you wish that would never occur, but unfortunatley it
does occur. ... It's a tragic situation.''
   ``So you would want me to have the baby even though my whole life
would be ruined and I could be mentally affected?'' she asked later.
   ``I would hope that the baby would live...,'' he said. ``I would
just like to see the baby have an opportunity.''
   Quayle was answering abortion questions again on Tuesday in his
plane to Tampa, Fla.
   The Indiana senator was asked about a comment the previous day in
which he said that he hoped if his wife were raped and became
pregnant, he hoped she would elect to have the baby and not have the
abortion.
   Asked if that wasn't a pro-choice stance, he said: ``It's her
choice, I told her what I would like but it's her choice. I cant
tell my wife what to do in that situation.''
   ``She would have that choice'' under the law as it is now
written, he said.

<HEAD>Australian Novelist Wins Booker Prize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australian novelist Peter Carey was awarded the
coveted Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday night for his love story,
``Oscar and Lucinda.''
   A panel of five judges unanimously announced the award of the
$26,250 prize after an 80-minute deliberation during a banquet at
London's ancient Guildhall.
   The judges made their selection from 102 books published in
Britain in the past 12 months and which they read in their homes.
   Carey, who lives in Sydney with his wife and son, said in a brief
speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to
attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won.
   ``If I'd known I was going to win I think I would have taken a
bit more trouble with my handwriting,'' he said as he stared down at
his notes.
   He was unsuccessful in the prize competition in 1985 when his
novel, ``Illywhacker,'' was among the final six.
   Carey called the award a ``great honor'' and he thanked the prize
sponsors for ``provoking so much passionate discussion about
literature _ perhaps there will be more tomorrow.''
   ``Everyone who loves good books benefits from this, surely,'' he
added.
   The winning novel is a fitting choice for Australia's
bicentennial year.
   It tells of a romance between an English gambler and an
Australian heiress who meet on a steamship's maiden voyage to
Australia in the mid-19th century. The story weaves in Australian
history from its founding in 1788 by British immigrants.
   Panel chairman Michael Foot, a writer and former leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said the judges agreed that entries this
year had been ``exceptionally strong'' and that choosing the last
six novels was extremely difficult.
   ``We hope there will be no criticisms but if there are, then
people should start reading the books for themselves,'' Foot said.
   Carey was the only non-Briton in the final six. The son of an
auto dealer, he was born in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, and attended
Geelong Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne, where the
Prince of Wales was also a pupil as an 18-year-old in 1966.
   Carey was an advertising copywriter before turning to writing
books in 1965.
   The first Booker Prize was awarded in 1969. It is administered by
Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books, and is sponsored
by Booker, an international food and farming business.

   Lloyd Bentsen, visiting the farm community
where his grandfather first settled in America, renewed his
counterattack Tuesday against what he called Republican ``lies and
distortions'' about Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``They say Governor Dukakis opposes the Stealth bomber. And I'm
here to tell you that's a lie, and they know it,'' Bentsen said.
   ``They say Governor Dukakis opposed deployment of the Pershing II
missile. And that's a lie, and they know it,'' he said.
   The Democrats and Republicans plan to spend the same amount on
defense _ but the Democrats would ``spend those dollars smarter,''
he said, for ``planes that fly, guns that work, ammunition and spare
parts.''
   ``I think the American people want better than lies and
distortions in this campaign,'' he said, challenging Bush to drop
his ads attacking Dukakis' defense positions.
   The Texas senator, who usually campaigns in states with the most
electoral votes, was in a state with the fewest _ three. He spoke in
a school auditorium to a crowd that was about double the White,
S.D., population of 474, and was greeted like a team at a
homecoming, with a band, pompon girls and loud cheering.
   Shops around town had greetings in the windows, and one street
was renamed Bentsen Blvd. for the day.
   The senator dropped by the Palace Cafe and Hotel to visit with
some elderly women from the town who went to school with Bentsen's
94-year-old father, Lloyd Sr. They told of still receiving gifts of
fruit from the elder Bentsen, who now lives near McAllen, Texas.
   Getting his father on the phone after a while, the senator
assured him ``they even told some good things about you.'' The phone
got handed around the table and they talked of the one-teacher
school where Lloyd Sr. made it through the fifth grade.
   The luncheonette's special of the day: The Bentsen Burger, which
at three bucks included potatoes, vegetable, dessert and coffee.
   Bentsen helped dedicate the historical museum for the town, which
was surrounded by sheep, cattle and the fields where Bentsen said
his grandfather Peter first homesteaded after arriving from Denmark
in 1887. The family survived the first winter in a sod hut by
burning straw for heat.
   Back on the subject of the election, he said the Republicans'
campaign ``robs the heart of democracy. It deprives you of the
opportunity to judge the issues and the candidates.''
   As the Democrats ``spent critical weeks'' developing solutions to
problems such as health care, education, and housing, ``all the
while our opponents campaigned with a total disregard for the
truth,'' he said. It was the first time Bentsen has offered a reason
why the Democrats failed to quickly counter the Republican attacks.
   Bentsen delivered the same message later in the day, after
arriving at a West Fargo, N.D., rally on a stagecoach.
   Wearing blue jeans, a leather jacket and a Western hat, Bentsen
and a local farmer named Jim Haugland drove a team of four
Clydesdales into a livestock show area while more than 700
supporters hollered their approval.
   Bentsen's visit Tuesday to the Dakotas and Montana was the second
trip to the region by the Democratic ticket since he and Michael
Dukakis stopped in Minot, N.D., immediately after the Democratic
convention in July. Dukakis had a rally in Fargo earlier this month.
   Bentsen told reporters on his campaign jet that while there were
only 10 electoral votes between the three states, ``it might make
the difference.''
   ``Nobody has paid any attention to these states,'' he said.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, Minnesota Senate candidate Hubert Humphrey III,
North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
joined Bentsen on stage at the school, which had an enormous
American flag as a backdrop.

   Israeli troops opened fire Tuesday on
stone-throwing Palestinian demonstrators in the occupied Gaza Strip,
killing a 14-year-old girl, hospital officials said.
   The driver of an Israeli oil tanker fired into a crowded Gaza
City vegetable market and wounded three Palestinians after his
vehicle was hit by a firebomb, according to Arab witnesses. They
said the bomb hit a tire and did not cause serious damage.
   Another 16 Palestinians were wounded in clashes between troops
and demonstrators in seven towns and refugee camps in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed three wounded in the occupied lands and said
it was checking the other casualty reports.
   The dead girl was identified as Manal Samour of the Shati refugee
camp on the edge of Gaza City. She was dead on arrival at the city's
Ahli Arab Hospital with a single bullet wound in the chest, said the
hospital officials, who insisted on anonymity.
   Doctors said the family removed the body for immediate burial.
   Witnesses in Shati said the girl apparently was struck when
soldiers fired on demonstrators from a rooftop. The witnesses,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said anti-Israeli protests
erupted in the camp after news of the girl's death spread. The camp
later was put under curfew, witnesses said.
   An army spokesman said he was checking the report of the girl's
death and the curfew.
   The death raised to 303 the number of Palestinians killed since
the start of the uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip on Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died.
   Also Tuesday, an army spokesman confirmed that soldiers fatally
shot a 17-year-old Palestinian during a clash Monday in the Faraa
refugee camp near Nablus.
   The spokesman said troops fired rubber bullets after being
attacked by youths throwing bottles and rocks. ``The soldiers found
their lives endangered, and an officer fired one bullet which hit
one of the youths. He died later,'' the spokesman said.
   In the incident involving the tanker driver, three Palestinians
were wounded, including a 50-year-old Palestinian hit in the chest,
Arab witnesses said. They said soldiers rushed to the scene, but
fired only in the air to disperse the crowd.
   In Jerusalem, two people were injured slightly when the buses in
which they were riding were struck with stones, police said.
   Israel's Itim news agency reported authorities shut down the
Rashidiyeh high school in Arab east Jerusalem until Oct. 31 because
of a demonstration Tuesday by students protesting the suspensions of
58 classmates. It said the the 58 were suspended because they
repeatedly skipped classes.

<HEAD>U.N. Panel Calls For Direct Peace Talks Between Morocco and
Polisario</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. decolonization committee on
Tuesday called on Morocco and the Polisario independence movement to
start direct peace talks to settle their war for sovereignty over
the Western Sahara.
   The committee, officially known as the Fourth Committee, voted
87-0 with 53 abstentions in favor of the motion sponsored by
Algeria, an ally of the Marxist-led Polisario movement.
   Polisario has been fighting for independence for the former
Spanish colony since 1975, when the colonial administration left and
Moroccan troops and settlers took over the sparsely populated,
110,000-square-mile territory in northwest Africa.
   Morocco opposes direct talks with Polisario, saying that
negotiating with the movement as an equal before the Saharans have
chosen them as their representative would grant Poliario a status
they have not earned.
   Most of the sponsors of Tuesday's motion were socialist and
developing nations. Spain voted in favor of the motion; the United
States, Britain, France, West Germany and most other Western nations
abstained. Morocco did not vote.
   The motion calls on Morocco and Polisario to begin direct
negotiations for a cease-fire and for holding a referendum on
seld-determination for the Saharan people.
   It also welcomed the acceptance by both sides in principle of
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's proposal that they honor
a truce and hold the referendum.
   Polisario spokesmen say that so far in indirect talks through the
secretary-general, the two parties have only agreed on the wording
of the referendum, which will be for either independence or
affiliation with Morocco, and that only people counted as Saharans
in the last colonial census in 1974 will be eligible to vote.
   That census put the population at 76,000.
   The United Nations plans to send about 2,000 peacekeeping troops
to Western Sahara to monitor the referendum and see that Moroccan
troops and Polisario fighters remain in their barracks and camps.
   Polisario says it has about 7,000 fighters in Western Sahara, and
that Morocco has 185,000 soldiers there. The independence movement
says that all except 7,000 Moroccan troops should withdraw to their
homeland before the referendum is conducted.

   Ten demonstrators for the homeless were
arrested Tuesday and charged with unlawful entry after staging a
sit-in in the office of Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen, Capitol police said.
   The 10, all from Amherst, Mass., were among a group ranging in
number from 15 to 25 who entered the offices at noon. Police said
the demonstrators refused to leave after meeting with Bentsen's
staff but weren't arrested until the close of business.
   Bentsen aides declined to call police to remove the peaceable
demonstrators, most of whom appeared to be in their mid-teens.
   The sit-in marked the latest in a series of Capitol Hill
demonstrations staged by the Washington-based Community for Creative
Nonviolence in a drive that began Sept. 26 and apparently is slated
to continue through election eve.
   The group, whose leader Mitch Snyder has fought a duel with the
Reagan administration over homeless aid, is demanding $25 billion in
housing funds.
   Capitol police spokesman Dan Nichols said 171 people have been
arrested thus far in the daily demonstrations.
   Bentsen spokesman Chris Peacock said the demonstrators initially
asked to speak with the Texas senator but were told he was on the
campaign trail.
   Peacock said Bentsen's legislative aide, Ray Bonilla, did chat
with them about housing problems and what could be done to help the
homeless.
   Other lawmakers whose offices have been visited, including
Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, have had police
remove the demonstrators within minutes of their arrival.
   Those arrested were being held overnight at the District of
Columbia jail and faced arraigment Wednesday in Superior Court. The
charge of unlawful entry carries a maximum penalty of six months in
jail and a $500 fine.

   An Army National Guard helicopter on a
nighttime anti-drug smuggling mission clipped a power line and
smashed into a desert hillside, killing the five lawmen and three
guardsmen aboard, officials said Tuesday.
   The fiery crash Monday came on the first night of Operation
Border Ranger, a joint anti-drug smuggling program conducted by six
Southern California sheriff's departments and the federal
government, said National Guard Maj. Steve Mensik.
   The program to stem the flow of drugs into the United States from
Mexico has been suspended while the accident investigation is
carried out, he said.
   The UH-1H aircraft crashed while investigating a car parked on a
remote access road off Interstate 8 in the Mountain Springs Grade
area, about 70 miles east of San Diego, Mensik said.
   ``They were in the process of descending to get a closer look at
the suspect vehicle. Apparently, at about 500 feet, they struck a
power line that had been strung between two hilltops,'' he said.
   Lt. Col. Gage of the Army National Guard, who declined to give
his first name, told The Associated Press that the car observed by
the helicopter apparently was a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle. When
asked what happened to the car, he said: ``Nothing. I believe it
turned out to be a Border Patrol vehicle. That's the best estimate.''
   Dale A. Musegades, the chief patrol agent for the El Centro
Border Patrol sector, said a Border Patrol vehicle that was not
involved in Operation Border Ranger was ``a few hundred yards from
the crash scene.'' It is common practice for Border Patrol agents to
dim their lights and park while on patrol, he added.
   He couldn't confirm that the helicopter had dropped down to check
out the vehicle, Musegades said.
   Imperial County sheriff's Lt. Kenneth J. Koon said the helicopter
smashed into the rocky foothills of the Laguna Mountains at 9:30
p.m. Monday and burst into flame.
   ``It was a very volatile fire. It burned everything. There was
very little left of the aircraft and it's going to be difficult to
put it (the accident) together,'' Koon said.
   In Washington, chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the crash
was observed by a spotter helicopter, an OH-58, that was flying at a
higher altitude.
   Five deputies from four Southern California counties and a
three-man California Army National Guard crew were aboard the
helicopter.
   Asked if the joint operation was the first of its kind, Koon
said: ``To our knowledge, yes. Certainly anything to this magnitude,
involving working relationships between that number of agencies for
a single operation.''
   Questioned about the status of the program, he replied, ``That's
a decision that will have to made by the sheriffs who put it
together, but I think it's a job that's going to have to be done,
one way or another.''
   All of the victims died instantly when the fire broke out,
according to a sheriff's department statement.
   The bodies have been recovered and deputies are guarding the
crash scene, pending arrival of a team of safety investigators from
the Army Safety Center in Fort Rucker, Ala., and the National Guard
Safety Office.
   The victims included Sgt. Richard G. Romero, 39, of El Centro, a
14-year veteran with the Imperial County Sheriff's Office; Orange
County Sheriff's Deputy Mark Steve Tonkin, 31, of Chino; and Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies Roy A. Chester, 41 and James D.
McSweeney, 43.
   Also killed were Riverside County Sheriff's Deputy Mike Davis and
a three-man California Army National Guard crew. Guard spokesman
Phil Jordan identified the three as Chief Warrant Officer 3 Geoffrey
L. Nett, 42, of Corona; 2nd Lt. Eric J. Smeltzer, 29, Rialto; and
Sgt. 1st Class Ramon M. Espinoz, 38, Westminster.
   Nett, the pilot, was a veteran flier with an excellent record,
Jordan said.
   San Bernardino and San Diego counties also participate in the
program, but had no personnel on board the craft Monday night.
   The Guardsmen and their helicopter were assigned to Company D,
140th Aviation Division, based at Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve
Center in Los Alamitos, 25 miles southeast of Los Angeles, he said.
   Ocotillo is 40 miles west of El Centro and less than 10 miles
from the U.S.-Mexican border.

<HEAD>Assembly Again Supports Nicaragua, World Court Against U.S. Contra
Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As it has done for three consecutive years,
the General Assembly on Tuesday voted to support a World Court
ruling against U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels and urged Washington to
obey the court.
   The vote was 89-2, with 48 abstentions on the resolution calling
on the United States to comply with the 1986 World Court ruling
against U.S. funding of anti-government insurgents.
   The United States and Israel voted against the resolution, as
they have in the past in the 159-nation General Assembly. Other
nations were absent.
   Last year the vote was 94-2, with 48 abstentions.
   The Netherlands supported Nicaragua Tuesday, changing its vote
from last year's abstention. Other nations which voted for Nicaragua
last year were absent or abstaining this year and observers said it
was not a clear-cut gain for either side.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the deputy permanent U.S.
representative, told the assembly that repeated consideration of the
item ``makes no contribution to peace in Central America'' and said
the item should be stricken from the agenda.
   ``The U.S. vote against this resolution is not a vote against the
International Court of Justice,'' Okun said. ``It is a vote against
a worn-out issue that is translated by the government of Nicaragua
into support for a repressive Sandinista government.''
   Okun called the resolution ``counterproductive'' and said
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has increased its
repression of democracy during the past year.
   The United States argues that the International Court of Justice,
the World Court's formal name, lacks jurisdiction in the case
because all parties to a dispute must accept jurisdiction and the
U.S. government has rejected it.
   The World Court statute does not require any state to accept
jurisdiction and the court operates on the basis of concensus and
acceptance of its authority.
   In 1986 the World Court ruled that continued U.S. financing of
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, constituted interference in
Nicaragua's internal affairs. The World Court is the primary U.N.
legal body and each U.N. member agrees to abide by its rulings.
   The resolution, identical to that submitted last year, says that
all states are obliged under international law not to intervene in
the internal affairs of other states.
   The Nicaraguan resolution urgently calls for full and immediate
compliance by the United States with the court ruling and says that
the General Assembly will consider the issue again next year.

<TEXT>
   A one-time whiz kid of carpet cleaning took
the witness stand in his securities fraud trial Tuesday and admitted
he manipulated stocks and defrauded investors in a
multimillion-dollar swindle.
   Barry Minkow, 22, assuming an embarrassed, shy demeanor, also
began laying out for jurors a defense of duress in which he claims
that organized crime figures dictated his every move.
   Minkow told jurors he was threatened with broken limbs or death
if he didn't run his business according to the dictates of two men _
one who he said tried to sexually molest him and the other ``a
Nazi'' who defamed Minkow's Jewish heritage.
   ``I felt like I was taking money from the devil,'' he said of his
alliance with the second man.
   Minkow described how he came under the sway of the first man,
Daniel Krowpman, a 230-pound weight lifter, tool salesman and
reputed loan shark who befriended Minkow at a gym where he exercised
in his early teens.
   ``He was my idol,'' said Minkow. ``He was everything because he
had money; he had build. He had everything I didn't have. ... He was
nice to me. He was like the father I never had. I loved him.''
   But he indicated Krowpman had a cruel side that surfaced when he
would arrive at the gym with a 6-foot-9, 330-pound weight lifter he
introduced as ``Big Steve.''
   ``When him and Steve were together it was like night and day,''
said Minkow. ``They would tease me about being puny and not able to
lift weights. They would throw me in the pool with my clothes on. It
wasn't the same.''
   Later, he said, Krowpman gave him $1,600 to set up his carpet
cleaning business but began demanding payments of $200 a month plus
50 per cent of the profits.
   He also blurted out that Krowpman once tried to molest him and
said he began paying him ``after the attempted rape.''
   Minkow's lawyer has said Minkow, who launched his ZZZZ Best
carpet cleaning company at 16 in his parents garage, was beaten and
threatened by mobsters who used him to perpetuate a $25 million
stock fraud.
   But prosecutors have portrayed Minkow as a shrewd con man who
bilked investors for his own benefit, selling them on the future of
a business that for the most part did not exist.
   Minkow is charged with 57 counts of securities fraud, credit card
fraud and mail fraud. Ten of his 12 co-defendants, including
Krowpman, have pleaded guilty to various charges related to the ZZZZ
Best operation. Accountant Norman Rothberg is on trial with Minkow,
accused of taking a bribe to cover up ZZZZ Best's frauds.
   The husky, dark-haired Minkow appeared nervous in his initial
moments on the stand. As his lawyer, David Kenner, asked him to
admit he had done the acts charged in the indictment, there were
long pauses and he bowed his head as if ashamed before he answered.
   Asked if he had made false claims for his business, Minkow
replied softly: ``It's true. I made those claims and they were all
lies.''
   The case is being heard by U.S. District Judge Dickran Tavrizian.

   A high school math teacher who
refuses to ditch his blue jeans and wear a necktie was reprimanded
Tuesday and ordered to comply with the dress code.
   Bill Webb, a 20-year veteran of teaching, already has been
suspended for 15 days this year. He refuses to obey a new dress code
for teachers at Point Pleasant High School because he feels his
attire has nothing to do with how well he teaches. He also has said
the policy violates the law.
   Superintendent Charles Chambers suspended Webb, 46, without pay
Oct. 7. At the time, he had just finished a four-day suspension for
the same reason.
   The Mason County school board voted 5-0 Monday night to uphold
Webb's latest suspension.
   ``If he doesn't comply, I will set up a conference with the
superintendent,'' said principal Michael Whalen. ``That's the next
level. The superintendent will have a conference with him and, as in
the past, he'll also request (Webb) to comply with the rules.''

   Forty-nine civil rights activists who were pelted
with rocks and bottles when they marched into virtually all-white
Forsyth County were awarded nearly $1 million by a jury that found
the Ku Klux Klan responsible.
   A verdict unsealed in U.S. District Court on Tuesday also found
11 individuals responsible for attacking the activists, who marched
into the county north of Atlanta on Jan. 17, 1987, and were met by
the counter-demonstrators, many of them KKK members or sympathizers.
   The jury reached its verdict Oct. 5, but Judge Charles A. Moye
Jr. ordered it sealed to give those who brought the lawsuit time to
decide whether to join Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams, who
wanted to drop it.
   Williams, who helped organize the march and was among those who
filed the lawsuit, urged toward the end of the trial that it be
dropped because it would impoverish the families of KKK members.
   He said Tuesday he would not take any money from the settlement.
   ``Irregardless of the court's decision, my decision not to accept
one single penny of my white brothers' and sisters' possessions is a
matter of conscience,'' Williams said. ``It is also stooping lower
than the KKK and other white supremacists to take away from them
their hard-earned material possessions, simply because they
brutalized us in responding to the sicknesses of our capitalistic
society.''
   In a letter Williams sent his fellow marchers during the trial,
he said he had ``talked'' to slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr. and King had told him ``Jesus wanted him not to sue the
Klan.''
   State Rep. J.E. ``Billy'' McKinney, who had opposed Williams'
effort to drop the lawsuit, said Williams' ``religion and
communication with the dead should not interfere with our
constitutional rights and justice.''
   Named as defendants in the lawsuit were the Southern White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan and 12 individuals.
   There had been 57 plaintiffs. Williams and three others dropped
out during the trial and four others dropped out Tuesday.
   The jury awarded $50 to each of the remaining plaintiffs in
compensatory damages. The rest was in punitive damages. The lawsuit
had sought $1.5 million.
   Defense attorney Jeffrey Sliz called the verdict ``grossly
unreasonable'' and said it would be appealed.
   ``I think there is a reasonable chance that the verdict will be
set aside,'' said Sliz, attorney for David Holland, Grand Dragon of
the White Knights, and the Southern White Knights. ``I was surprised
at the amount.''
   The two Klan organizations were assessed $400,000 each. Holland
was ordered to pay $50,000. Awards from 10 other individuals ranged
from $30,000 to $1,000, and the 12th defendant, Harold Palmour, was
judged not liable.
   Palmour, who was shown on film with a rock in his hand during the
counter-demonstration, testified that he had been ``caught up'' in
the emotional confrontation. He said he did not mean to do it and
apologized.
   It was the second major award against the KKK in less than two
years.
   In February 1987, a federal jury in Alabama awarded Beulah Mae
Donald $7 million from the United Klans of America and six members
or former members of the group after her son, Michael Donald, was
beaten, strangled and hanged in a tree in 1981 at age 19.
   The Atlanta march was a forerunner to a larger demonstration a
week later in which an estimated 24,000 people turned out. State,
local, county and federal troops were called out to protect the
marchers and prevent violence.
   A march into the county a year ago commemorating the anniversary
of the 1987 marches was peaceful.

   Dan Quayle told a persistent young reporter
from a children's news program he would rather she had a baby than
abort the fetus if she became pregnant through her father.
   ``That's a difficult question and one that does not have an easy
answer, but my answer would be yes,'' the Republican vice
presidential candidate told an 11-year-old reporter for ``Chidren's
Express'' during a bus tour of Illinois last week.
   The question-and-answer session was broadcast Tuesday on the CBS
evening news. The children's show is broadcast on public television.
   ``But don't you think it would ruin my whole life? ... It's not
even my fault and my whole life would be ruined,'' the reporter
asked.
   ``Well, I don't think that would be the case at all,'' Quayle
said. ``I think that if somebody had an unfortunate experience like
that, it would be something that you would remember the rest of your
life.
   ``The idea of a father abusing a daughter is a horrendous
situation, one you wish that would never occur, but unfortunatley it
does occur. ... It's a tragic situation.''
   ``So you would want me to have the baby even though my whole life
would be ruined and I could be mentally affected?'' she asked later.
   ``I would hope that the baby would live...,'' he said. ``I would
just like to see the baby have an opportunity.''
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential
candidate, told another interviewer for the program: ``I would say
at first that I would try very much to discourage this abortion. I
believe that adoption is the alternative, and I'm an adoptive
parent. ... I strongly lean towards that, but finally I think it
should be a woman's choice.
   ``I would hope very much that she would confer with her clergyman
that she would confer at length with her physician before making
that kind of a choice. But finally, she makes it.''
   Quayle was answering abortion questions again on Tuesday in his
plane to Tampa, Fla.
   The Indiana senator was asked about a comment the previous day in
which he said that he hoped if his wife were raped and became
pregnant, he hoped she would elect to have the baby and not have the
abortion.
   Asked if that wasn't a pro-choice stance, he said: ``It's her
choice, I told her what I would like but it's her choice. I cant
tell my wife what to do in that situation.''
   ``She would have that choice'' under the law as it is now
written, he said.

   A second secretary at Saudi Arabia's
Embassy was shot and killed Tuesday night as he approached his home
after work, the governor of Ankara state said.
   Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk told The Associated Press that Abdul
Ghani Beddawi was attacked around 10 p.m. while entering his
apartment building in the Kavaklidere district of Ankara, the
Turkish capital.
   He said Bedawi died instantly after being shot in his head and
chest.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
   ``The police did not know the purpose behind the incident,''
Beduk said. He said police were investigating but did not know
immediately how many gunmen were involved.
   Police refused comment. A person answering the telephone at the
Saudi Embassy in Ankara said the ambassador was asleep and could not
be disturbed.
   Beduk said Beddawi, a second secretary at the embassy who
appeared to be in his 50s, was returning from his office when shot.
   He lived with his family in Ankara, Beduk said.

<HEAD>Economist: Drought Not The Disaster Some Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH HARRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drought of 1988 was not the economic
disaster some expected and might turn out to be a bonanza for some
farmers, an agricultural economist said Tuesday.
   ``The drought likely will have minimal impact on overall farm
financial conditions,'' said Warren Lee of Ohio State University.
``Some people _ and I would cite those who came into 1988 with crops
from previous years, and the large number of farmers who had normal
or near-normal yields _ they're having one of their best years in
10.''
   Lee said there's no question that some farms were hurt, or that
most farmers saw decreases in yields. Livestock producers in
particular will suffer because feed prices are increasing in a
period when selling prices are down.
   But about 60 percent of Ohio's agricultural operations are
crop-related, and while yields are down they are for the most part
more than offset by crop price increases, he said.
   ``Your yields may be down 25 percent, but prices are up 30
percent or more,'' he said. ``From that perspective, while there may
be a few isolated cases of the drought pushing an already stressed
operation over the edge, for the most part, it'll have a neutral
effect on farm financial issues.
   ``We'll even see ... another small rise in farm land prices,'' he
said.
   Doug Durliat, communications director for the Ohio Farmers'
Union, said the situation was improving, but he disagreed that some
farmers are having banner years.
   Drought-related losses ``are not going to be as widespread as
originally feared,'' Durliat said. ``But you'll still hear about a
lot of farmers who were put behind the eight-ball by this drought.''
   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, said Lee's assessment was generally
correct. Oxley said 7 inches of rain in his district in August
``brought the corn crop back when they had given it up for dead.''
   The federal government in July declared Ohio and several other
states disaster areas, making low-interest loans available to
farmers and freeing government stores of feed and federal set-aside
acreage for livestock producers.

<HEAD>Moratorium Imposed on Pension Plan Reversions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department has imposed a six-month
moratorium on allowing companies to capture excess assets through
termination of their overfunded pension plans.
   The department said it directed the Internal Revenue Service on
Monday to delay until May 1 next year approval of pension plan
terminations in which excess assets would be recovered by employer
sponsors of the plans.
   According to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., corporate
sponsors of defined benefit pension plans have recovered a total of
$18.8 billion since 1980 by terminating 1,752 overfunded plans and
funding their liabilities through annuities or newly established
plans.
   In the first half of 1988, 30 companies terminated overfunded
pension plans, recapturing $199 million in excess assets, said the
PBGC, a government agency that insures defined benefit pension plan
participants against losses much like the Federal Deposit Insurance
Crop. insures bank depositors.
   ``This moratorium will give Congress time to come up with
legislation that will make certain that workers and retirees get a
fair share of those funds,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   Metzenbaum sponsored legislation in the last Congress to heavily
tax any surplus pension plan assets that revert to companies through
terminations as a way to discourage the practice.
   The measure was stricken from the tax bill that was passed by
Congress last week in exchange for an agreement by the
administration to impose the moratorium.
   Under the current law, such reversions are allowed as long as
vested participants in the plans are assured the pensions accrued to
them at the time of termination.
   Unions and advocacy groups for the elderly and pensioners have
maintained that companies should be prevented from capturing excess
assets from the plans in order to insure against possible future
investment losses and provide cost-of-living increases to pensioners.
   Business groups, whose members have used surplus pension plan
assets in the past several years as a source of capital, have
opposed major changes in the law.
   ``There is a longstanding precedent that these assets belong to
the employer,'' Edwin Gilroy, a National Association of
Manufacturers lobbyist, said Tuesday. ``The whole issue boils down
to the one question of whose assets are these.''
   Since employers have to make up the difference when a pension
plan runs short, they ought to be able to tap the surplus when a
pension plan's investments produce higher-than-expected dividends,
he said.
   However, Karen Friedman, a lobbyist for the Washington-based
Pension Rights Center, said the surpluses enable companies to say
``yes'' when retirees ask for cost-of-living increases.
   ``They're funded to be on-going,'' she said. ``The companies get
tax breaks because they're on-going.''

   Rescuers said Tuesday they had found
only 15 survivors from a ship with more than 500 people aboard that
was sent to the bottom by Typhoon Rug. More than 100,000
Filipinos were made homeless by the typhoon.
   As of 4 a.m. Wednesday (4 p.m. EDT Tuesday), the typhoon was
centered near latitude 16.3 north, longitude 117.5 east, in the
South China Sea about 190 miles west of the Philippines coastal city
of Dagupan. The government weather service said Ruby's maximum
sustained winds had decreased to 93 mph and that the typhoon was
moving west-northwest at about 4 mph.
   A coast guard cutter was dispatched early Wednesday to port of
Cebu, 100 miles from where the Dona Marilyn went down, to search for
missing passengers.
   That would bring to three the number of major vessels searching
for survivors of the Dona Marilyn, a 2,845-ton passenger liner that
replaced the Dona Paz on the Sulpicio Lines run between Manila and
Tacloban.
   The Dona Paz sank Dec. 20, 1987, after a collision off Mindoro
Island with a tanker, and only 26 people were rescued. The official
death toll was 1,749, but some estimates said 3,000 died because
many deck passengers making the holiday trip to Manila were not on
the manifest.
   In suburban Manila, U.S. and Philippine helicopters rescued
hundreds of people stranded on rooftops and in trees by the flooding
Marikina River.
   Coast Guard officials said the Dona Marilyn sank Monday in the
Visayas Sea about 300 miles southeast of Manila while it was making
the Manila-Tacloban run.
   It was carrying 451 passengers and 60 crew members from Manila to
Tacloban on Leyte Island when it radioed a distress call, said
Carlos Go, general manager of Sulpicio Lines.
   Lt. Rey Esguerra of the coast guard station in Cebu said rescuers
had found 11 survivors on Maripipi Island and another small island,
and four people were found alive in the water.
   Vicente Gambito, vice president of Sulpicio, put the number
rescued at 18. There was no explanation for the discrepancy.
   The Dona Marilyn was authorized to carry about 1,400 passengers
and crew.
   Officials reported 25 people missing because of Typhoon Ruby at
Cagayan de Oro, a coastal city on Mindanao Island, and 15
unaccounted for after a crowded bus plunged into a swollen river
Monday in Antique province. The Red Cross said 26 bodies were
recovered from the bus.
   Floods on Luzon and other islands caused landslides and washed
away bridges.
   Carlos Dominguez, the agriculture secretary, said preliminary
estimates put damage to crops at nearly $46 million, but casualty
and damage reports were incomplete because of poor communications.
   Figures compiled from the Red Cross and government agencies
showed 26 dead in Antique province, 20 in Occidental Mindoro, 15 in
Zamboanga del Sur, 11 in Cagayan de Oro, 11 in Manila's Marikina
suburb, six on Camiguin Island, four in Iloilo, three in Nueva
Ecija, two in Surigao City and one each in Pampanga and Bulacan.
   Ruby's center passed about 50 miles east of Manila early Tuesday
and swept into the Tarlac, Bulacan and Nueva Ecija provinces, the
archipelago's main rice-growing region, the national weather service
reported.
   Meteorologists said more than nine inches of rain fell in 24
hours at the Manila airport. Domestic flights were canceled but
international service continued.
   President Corazon Aquino visited flooded Marikina, the
hardest-hit district in the Manila area, on Tuesday and met with
some of the thousands who fled their homes.
   Two American helicopters from Clark Air Base joined Filipino
soldiers and civilian volunteers in rescuing stranded people.
   A Philippine navy landing craft and a hospital vessel capsized in
heavy seas Monday at Zamboangak, but no casualties were reported. A
tugboat owned by the state-run Philippine National Oil Company sank
off the Bataan Peninsula, also with no casualties.
   Schools, government offices, the two stock exchanges and many
private businesses in Manila were closed Tuesday and the government
said schools would not open Wednesday because of widespread flooding
and power outages. Some schools were being used as evacuation
centers.
   At least 110,000 of the nation's 56 million people were left
homeless, officials reported. The government said 400,000 people
were ``affected,'' meaning their homes were damaged or destroyed.
   Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark, 50 miles north of Manila,
reported no major structural damage there, but said some aircraft
were evacuated to an undisclosed ``safe location.''
   Typhoon Ruby was the 18th typhoon or tropical storm to strike the
Philippines this year and the strongest on Luzon since Patsy killed
at least 175 people in 1970.

<HEAD>Anne Frank Letters Sold At Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two letters and a postcard written by Anne Frank
and her sister, Margot, were sold to an anonymous bidder at an
auction Tuesday for $150,000.
   The young Jewish Holocaust victims mailed the notes along with
two photographs to American pen pals in 1940, a month before Nazi
Germany invaded the Netherlands, prompting the Franks to go into
hiding.
   The successful bidder said he represented ``a number of
institutions'' but would not specify further, said Will Bennett,
spokesman for Swann Galleries, the auction house. However, the
bidder did say he would announce on Wednesday the name of the
institution where the letters will be kept, Bennett said.
   Also on the auction block were pages from Thomas Edison's
notebooks, Marilyn Monroe's certificate of conversion to Judaism,
and a collection of Greta Garbo correspondence.
   Bidding for the Frank collection was over in five minutes. Swann
had predicted bidding would exceed $30,000 but could not estimate
how high it would go because nothing written by Anne Frank had ever
been auctioned.
   Among the bidders for the letters was actress Whoopi Goldberg,
one of hundreds who participated in the auction by telephone. About
250 people attended the sale in person.
   The correspondence between the two sisters and their pen pals in
Iowa was dated April 27 and April 29, 1940. It described the girls'
life at home and school in Amsterdam. Margot wrote that ``having a
frontier with Germany and being a small country we never feel safe.''
   A month after the letters were sent, Germany invaded the
Netherlands. The Franks went into hiding but were later discovered
and sent to concentration camps. Anne's diary, published in 1952,
carries a poignant account of their life in hiding.
   The Franks' pen-pals were sisters from Danville, Iowa: Juanita
Wagner, 11, who was Anne's age, and Betty Ann Wagner, 15, who was
Margot's age. The Wagner sisters wrote back, but never heard from
the Frank girls again.
   After the war, they wrote again, and Anne's father replied,
explaining that he was the only one in his family to survive the war.
   The Wagner sisters, now living in California, decided earlier
this year to sell the letters. ``We had been discussing what I was
going to do to retire. I've never really saved very much,'' said
Betty Ann Wagner, who was reached by telephone at her home in the
Los Angeles area.
   Miss Wagner also said she plans to donate part of the money from
the sale to Wayfarer Ministries, a non-profit organization she
founded nine years ago to ship books to missionaries.
   She and her sister hope to travel to Amsterdam to visit the house
where Anne hid with her family, Miss Wagner said. ``We'd worried
about her during the war but never dreamed that she was suffering.''
   Also sold at the auction were several Marilyn Monroe autographs,
including her certificate of conversion to Judaism, which took place
just prior to her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. The
certificate was bought by a private collector for $7,000, Bennett
said.
   A handwritten letter of condolence from Emily Dickinson to the
husband of a friend who died brought $8,000 from a dealer, he said.
   Seventy-six pages of handwritten notes by Thomas Edison brought
$32,000. Edison compiled the manuscript, which concerns his travels,
jobs and inventions, for use by his official biographers, Bennett
said.
   A collection of correspondence from Greta Garbo was bought by a
collector for $9,500, Bennett said.

   Two photographs of U.S. hostages found in the
luggage of a Lebanese woman at Milan's airport are reproductions,
police said Tuesday.
   U.S. officials said they doubted that photos and documents
carried by the woman were part of an effort to free Americans held
in Lebanon.
   ``It might be prudent to view this with a certain degree of
skepticism,'' said one American official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Police released a third photo the woman was carrying, saying it
also was a reproduction. They could not identify the subject, a
thin-faced man with a dark, curly beard. The other two photos were
of hostages Terry Anderson and Alann Steen.
   Authorities said the woman was to give the pictures and several
documents _ including a letter bearing Steen's name _ to Aldo
Anghessa, an Italian arms trader with links to Swiss and Italian
intelligence agencies.
   He was to deliver them to a third party, but authorities would
not say who that might be.
   The woman, identified as Aline Ibrahim Rizkallah, 36, was
arrested at Milan's Linate Airport last Thursday after arriving from
Beirut. Police reported also finding $1,000 in counterfeit U.S.
bills and 1.7 ounces of heroin on her.
   U.S. officials, including an FBI representative, were en route to
Milan to investigate.
   The U.S. official, who saw a photocopy of the letter, said it was
``not in normal English that a native English-speaker would use,''
but said that did not necessarily mean it was a fake.
   Achille Serra, head of the anti-terrorism unit of Milan's police,
told reporters that if the handwriting turns out not to be Steen's,
``things change a lot. We would be talking about a fraud.''
   It was not clear who would have been the target of a possible
swindle.
   The photo of Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, appeared to be a copy of one issued in August by
the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad. The picture of Steen, who is believed
held by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, was the same
as one released last February.
   The woman carried letters for Anghessa and an Italian prisoner in
Massa, Italy, Serra said. Both were in coded Italian which police
were trying to decipher, he said.
   The woman, apparently a courier, said she was to receive about
$4,000 from Anghessa, police said. He denied it.
   Serra said police had identified the man who supplied the woman
with the pictures and documents and were considering going to
Lebanon to question him.
   Islamic Jihad denied Monday it was connected with the woman.
   Anderson and Steen are among nine Americans held by pro-Iranian
extremist factions linked to Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Anderson was seized in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Steen, of Boston, was kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987 at Beirut
University College, where he taught.
   Three Britons, and Irishman and an Italian also are missing and
believed held hostage in Lebanon.

   Former Nazi SS officer Klaus Barbie, once
known as the ``Butcher of Lyon,'' was questioned Tuesday by West
German authorities in connection with an investigation of a German
count accused of war crimes.
   Barbie, the onetime Gestapo chief of Lyon, was sentenced to life
imprisonment on July 4, 1987 for crimes against humanity.
   West German investigating judges Host Shneider, Josef Jansen and
Martin Licksett questioned Barbie in his cell at St. Josephs prison
about the World War II activities of Count Leonhard von Korff.
   Von Korff served as a ministerial counselor in Bonn until French
Nazi- hunter Serge Klarfeld unmasked him as the former Gestapo chief
in the Chalons-sur-Marne region of northeastern France during the
Nazi occupation.
   The West Germans are looking into allegations that von Korff
deported 185 Jews to Drancy transit camp near Paris, from which they
were then sent to Nazi death camps.
   A French judge and Barbie's lawyer, Jacques Verges, accompanied
the judges in their interview.

<TEXT>
   Five men, including one believed to be a leader
in a multibillion-dollar Colombian drug cartel, were indicted
Tuesday on charges they conspired to import more than a ton of
cocaine a week.
   A federal grand jury in Brooklyn issued the indictment despite
reported death threats, officials said.
   Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha and four alleged underlings in the
Medellin cartel were charged with conspiring with undercover agents,
who posed as brokers, to import 2,200 pounds of cocaine every eight
days into the New York area, authorities said.
   Since Gacha, 47, lives in Colombia, federal authorities said his
prosecution is unlikely because there is no extradition treaty
between the United States and Colombia.
   ``Only by taking off the leadership of these cartels can we hope
to put a crimp into these organizations,'' said U.S. Attorney Andrew
Maloney.
   Maloney said he was optimistic that an extradition treaty between
the two countries would be negotiated in the future so Gacha could
be brought to New York to face the charges.
   Three of the defendants, who were identified as employees of the
cartel's New York distribution operation, were arrested in July when
federal agents seized 1,350 pounds of cocaine near La Guardia
Airport, the first shipment in the sting operation.
   The fifth defendant, Oscar Vegas, who was identified as a
lieutenant in the Medellin cartel, also lives in Colombia and
remains unapprehended.
   The men were charged with operating a continuing criminal
enterprise, conspiracy to import cocaine and conspiracy to
distribute cocaine.
   The criminal enterprise and the possession charges carry a
maximum penalty of up to life in prison upon conviction. The
defendants could be fined up to $6 million.
   Gacha also was named Tuesday in a separate indictment filed in
Miami's federal court that charged him and six others with one count
of conspiracy to import cocaine.
   He was identified as one of three leaders of the cartel, which is
named for the Colombian city in which it is based.
   Robert Stutman, the head of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration's New York office, described Gacha as ``the most
active member'' of the Medellin cartel, which he said dominates the
cocaine market in Miami, Los Angeles and several European cities.
   Stutman said his agency had received intelligence reports from
Colombia that Gacha had issued death threats against Stutman, Mayor
Edward I. Koch and other law enforcement officials for actions taken
against the Medellin organization.
   ``The more they threaten, the more we'll go after them,'' Stutman
said.

   The Soviet Union is seeking agreement to use a
Philippines ship repair yard, raising U.S. concerns about potential
eavesdropping on the strategic American naval base at Subic Bay,
according to government officials.
   The officials said the administration opposes any such
arrangement on grounds that it would give the Soviets close access
to Subic, which is perhaps the most important American military
installation outside the United States.
   The Philippines has rejected previous Soviet requests for ship
repair at the Philseco yard but Moscow recently renewed the
request. The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said there are
inconclusive indications the Philippines may approve the new
request.
   One reason Filipino authorities may change their mind, the
officials said, is that the repair yard is losing money. The
enterprise is a joint venture of Philippine and Japanese interests.

   Two trapped whales reversed course and
headed back toward shore, frustrating efforts to coax them toward
open water, as scientists probed an ice ridge for a weak spot that
Soviet icebreakers could attack.
   ``It's discouraging,'' federal biologist David Withrow said
Monday as the mammals, apparently spooked by a shoal that has
stymied progress for three days, retreated about 800 yards. ``Why
come back here when they know it's open up there?''
   The California gray whales struggled up for air, tiring quickly
as they poked their way through large slabs of Beaufort Sea ice and
thick slush left by efforts to carve them a path to freedom.
   At one point, the 27-foot-long whale _ the smaller of the two _
rested the end of its huge snout on the edge of the ice. Blood
oozed from a raw spot on its snout, smearing the ice and staining
the water.

   Frozen corpses of two seamen who died during
a doomed Arctic expedition in 1848 contain bacteria that show
unexpected resistance to antibiotics developed more than 120 years
later, scientists say.
   Because there is evidence that lead poisoning killed the men,
the researchers speculate that heavy metal pollutants, not just
overuse of antibiotics, may play a role in creating disease germs
that survive drugs.
   The proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become a
major problem, especially in Third World nations where the drugs
are used indiscriminately, killing vulnerable bacteria and allowing
resistant bacteria to reproduce.
   But medical microbiologist Dr. Kinga Kowalewska-Grochowska said
the study she conducted with colleagues at the University of
Alberta in Edmonton has prompted her to speculate environmental
pollution may spur development of some antibiotic-resistant germs.

<HEAD>CBS' New, But Not Improved `Van Dyke Show'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After canning the original pilot for ``The Van
Dyke Show,'' premiering on CBS tonight, the producers seem to have
slapped together a replacement from one of those kits at the sitcom
store.
   This is like do-it-yourself comedy. The actors ought to have
blank dialogue balloons over their heads. The audience could do
just as well filling in the predictable lines as the writers.
   Meanwhile, the producers of Mary Tyler Moore's new series,
``Annie McGuire,'' which premieres tonight after ``Van Dyke,'' also
had to re-shoot their pilot. The new version wasn't available for
review _ usually a dead giveaway a show has serious troubles,
especially since the network willingly showed critics ``The Van
Dyke Show.'' Granted, this is the network that canceled ``Frank's
Place''; perhaps they're in no position to judge.
   Van Dyke and Moore were co-stars in the 1960s hit ``The Dick Van
Dyke Show.'' Moore had her own hugely successful ``The Mary Tyler
Moore Show'' a decade later.
   CBS hopes these comedy veterans can help shore up lagging
ratings and ease a dearth of half-hour comedies. But CBS apparently
took no hint from ``Life With Lucy.'' It's painful, not reassuring,
to see beloved stars come back in bad shows.
   The original pilot for ``Annie McGuire,'' then known only as
``The Untitled Mary Tyler Moore Project,'' was shown to critics
last summer but was re-cast, apparently because the husband, played
by Edward J. Moore (no relation), was so darned dull. He is now
played by Denis Arndt.
   Moore plays a sophisticated Manhattanite who works for City Hall
and has recently married Nick, a blue-collar Jersey guy. The
original pilot followed their courtship. In the new version, they
have been married for a few weeks. Her mom is a liberal. His is a
conservative. Tonight's plot centers more on Annie's job in which
she meets a disabled Vietnam veteran. Does it sound like someone's
throwing in the kitchen sink here, or what?
   We have seen Van Dyke's show. He plays Dick Burgess, a big-name
song-and-dance man who moves to the small Pennsylvania town where
his son, Matt, played by Van Dyke's real-life son, Barry, runs a
local theater. Barry Van Dyke is a talented and likeable guy, but
he doesn't look very comfortable here. But then, who would?
   Matt has a typical sitcom wife, Chris (Kari Lizer), and a
typical sitcom son, Noah (Billy O'Sullivan). At home, the elder Van
Dyke engages in the slapstick that was his trademark on the old
``Dick Van Dyke Show,'' only this time, instead of falling over an
ottoman, he tries to climb into his grandson's bunkbed _ for a
long, long time.
   Down at Matt's theater, there are typical sitcom extras:
smart-aleck office assistant Jillian (Maura Tierney), aspiring
actor-cleaning boy Erick (Paul Scherrer), and a wise old stage
manager, Doc, played by Whitman Mayo, who played Grady on ``Sanford
and Son.''
   The show was directed by talented veteran Jay Sandrich (``The
Cosby Show''), and the studio is run by Grant Tinker, formerly
known as Mr. Quality. But the writing is weak, credited to
executive producers Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark. Go out and hire
someone, guys.
   Here's one of the funnier lines: When Van Dyke the elder comes
down for breakfast, he notes he not only has destroyed the child's
bunkbed, but also the rug _ by spilling an aquarium onto it. ``Is
my fish OK?'' queries Noah. ``He's fine,'' says Dick. ``Er, just
don't flush.''
   The producers may be saying the same thing to CBS in a few weeks.

<HEAD>Male Domination Called Result Of Sin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Religious feminists fume at that old passage in
Genesis 3:16 about women, ``Your desire shall be for your husband,
and he shall rule over you.''
   However, no less a religious authority than Pope John Paul II
says the passage refers to a flawed condition in humanity and it is
not supposed to be that way.
   ``This `domination' indicates the disturbance and the loss of
the stability of that fundamental equality which the man and woman
possess in the `unity of the two,''' he says.
   It results from original sin, he says, from the human attempt to
be supreme and outrival God.
   ``The overcoming of this evil inheritance is, generation after
generation, the task of every human being, whether man or women,''
the pope says.
   Although his recent letter on women plainly kept them barred
from his church's priesthood, it still hacked away at some of the
old religious biases against them.
   In fact, he describes woman as the ``biblical exemplar'' from
the beginning of history to its close.
   He notes that at the end of time, she is portrayed in Revelation
12:1 as ``a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her
feet, and on her head a crown of stars.''
   ``One can say she is a woman of cosmic scale, on a scale with
the whole of creation,'' the pope says of the symbolism, marveling
at woman's high role. ``God entrusts the human being to her in a
special way.''
   The pope says the exceptional womanly prerogative also shows up
in a woman being the means by which divinity joined humanity in
Christ ``born to a woman,'' Mary of Nazareth.
   ``Thus there begins the central event, the key event in the
history of salvation,'' the pope says. ``A woman is to be found at
the center of this salvific event.''
   Although the pope's Sept. 30 teaching letter, ``Mulieris
Dignitatem'' (The Dignity of Women) drew scant attention and only
mixed reactions, it offers some rare papal rebukes to common
religious slights against women.
   He even tackles the pervasive masculine images of God _ a
regular and controversial target of Christian feminists _ declaring
that God's creativity is ``neither ```masculine' nor `feminine' ,''
but ``totally divine.''
   While humanity is created in ``likeness'' to God, there also is
a ``non-likeness'' to him, the ``Different One'' or ``totally
Other,'' the pope says.
   He adds that the Bible's characteristic anthropomorphic way of
speaking about God refers to his ``fatherhood,'' but that doesn't
mean maleness as in human fatherhood.
   He points out that various Scripture passages attribute to God
both masculine and feminine qualities, sometimes picturing him as a
caring, comforting mother.
   ``Thus every element of human generation which is proper to man,
and every element which is proper to woman, namely human
`fatherhood' and `motherhood,' bear within itself a likeness to, or
analogy with the divine `generating' which is in God,'' the pope
says.
   He says that women possess ``essential equality'' with men, that
both ``are human beings to an equal degree, both are created in
God's image.''
   While the biblical narrative says that sin was initiated by the
woman, Eve, followed by man, Adam, the pope rejects that twist
putting the prior blame on women, declaring:
   ``There is no doubt that, independent of this `distinction of
roles,' that first sin is the sin of man, created by God as male
and female. It is also the sin of the `first parents'...
   ``As the author of the evil of sin, the human being _ man and
woman _ is affected by it.''
   Besides emphasizing the role of a woman, Mary, as the channel by
which God entered humanity in Jesus, the pope pictures women as key
figures in his ministry, and him as a sort of the original women's
liberator.
   Christ ``became a promoter of women's true dignity and of the
vocation corresponding to this dignity,'' the pope says. ``At times
this caused wonder and surprise, often to the point of scandal.''
   Furthermore, the pope notes, women played major roles in his
ministry: Women supported it with their means. The Samaritan woman
became his first mass evangelist. Women stood by him at the cross
while male apostles hid in fear.
   In ``this most arduous test of faith and fidelity the women
proved stronger than the apostles,'' the pope observes.
   Women also were the first to report the empty tomb after the
resurrection and the first to meet the risen Christ and proclaim it
to others.
   Women take an unusual precedence, as the pope describes it, but
he still sees the priesthood as limited to males.

   Bishops of six of the 99 dioceses of the
Episcopal Church have denounced the election in Boston last month
of the Rev. Barbara Harris to be the first woman bishop in the
worldwide Anglican communion.
   The Episcopal Church is one of 28 national branches of that
communion.
   Declaring that Anglican faith would be ``irrreparably
compromised'' if she is consecrated a bishop, the six protesting
bishops said they ``cannot accept the validity of ordinations or
confirmations she administers.''
   Her consecration is not expected before next February. A few
parish rectors in the Massachusetts dioceses have said they would
not recognize a woman as bishop.
   Roman Catholic J. Francis Stafford of Denver, head of the
bishops' ecumenical affairs committee, said a woman's becoming an
Anglican bishop would hinder the ``process of reconciliation'' with
Roman Catholicism.

   The grants, ranging from $175,000 to $355,000 each, went to five
theological schools and to offices of five of the largest religious
denominations in the country.
   A panel of independent judges selected the 10 winning proposals
for grants out of 47 submitted from around the nation.
   ``No single religious issue that the endowment has invested in
over the past 15 years has elicited a response of this magnitude,''
says Fred L. Hofheinz, an endowment officer.
   ``All the grant recipients have figured out distinctive problems
they face in attracting qualified candidates to the ministry...
They are all seriously committed to a correction course.''

<HEAD>A Letter to Tovarich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capitalism is an ingenious creator, a constant
revolution in which new destroys old, a riotous, unruly process that
proceeds with no respect for central planning.
   Those observations come from an open letter to Soviet citizens,
now beginning to experiment with capitalism, from an American
corporate economist. It concludes with the assurance that ``you have
our sympathy in full measure.''
   James Griffen, vice president and corporate economist for Aetna
Life & Casualty, wrote the letter to a mythical tovarich, or
comrade, as a means of making some points about capitalism that
escape even Americans.
   Soviet leaders are misinformed, says Griffen, if they believe the
party can control capitalism to meet party needs.
   If Soviet leaders are able to graft private enterprise onto
Russian rootstock, ``they will have no hope of controlling its
growth to conform to a previously established acceptable norm,''
says Griffen.
   ``If you import real capitalism, tovarich, be prepared for
riotous unruly growth that pays little heed and no respect to plot
plans,'' he writes in a company publication, ``AEconomics,''
reminding Russians that capitalism builds but also destroys.
   He cites Joseph Schumpeter, one of the greatest of Western
economists, who expressed respect for capitalism's power to build,
but observed also that it has an enormous power to tear down what it
had previously built.
   ``Count on it, tovarich, capitalism can tear down what you have
built, too, and surely will do so if given half a chance. Our
bombers and our missiles cannot so thoroughly change your landscape
as capitalism can.''
   He explains:
   ``Who can say what capitalism will create in your country to take
the place of what it destroys.
   ``The enterprise system within which we live provides incentives
to people to follow their dreams, to create the life they wish to
live and to learn how to support it.
   ``When millions of people are free to behave in this manner,
ingeniouus solutions to problems appear as if by magic. Amazing
efficiencies are discovered. Human needs and wants are fulfilled
better, faster and less expensively _ capitalism has survived
because it serves people better than any other social arrangement.''
   But, again, it has little respect for tradition.
   As capitalism reinvents itself it tramples on old products,
businesses, jobs, ways of doing business, ways of living, he says.
It is a process of creative destruction. It precedes a long wave or
surge of progress.
   It happened in America during the Great Depression of the 1930s,
says Griffen. The people of Japan, who enjoy one of the world's
highest standards of living, even now complain about the loss of the
old ways.
   In Latin America, he says, you may find many examples of
misguided capitalism and little of its creativity. Birthing pangs
are felt in Yugoslavia, Burma, Algeria, China _ in whatever nations
``rotate through the headlines.''
   They are felt in the United States, and always will be so long as
the process of revolutionary renewal continues.
   The automotive industry, for instance, had been in a depression
as a result of new ways of making cars with new materials by
different people in distant countries.
   ``Jobs have been lost in automobile companies and in the unions
and suppliers that deal with them. Local communities have been
affected. Old factories have become new shopping malls or
condominiums.''
   The same is true in agriculture and finance, says Griffen,
observing that ``recently it has reached an intensity as to have
touched nearly everyone's life.''
   He observes that the power of the market has thrown hundreds of
thousands out of work, but it has also created millions of jobs.
Statistically, he says, this is an enormous net gain, ``but for
those whose old way of life was disrupted there has been a real cost
not measured in gross national product.''
   Will it work in the Soviet Union? Griffen writes tovarich:
   ``Your leaders hope the Communist Party can maintain control of
this revolution, but that seems unlikely. Russian capitalism will
create power centers, interest groups and spheres of influence too
numerous to count let alone control.''
   The capitalist way of life, he reminds his mythical comrade, is a
diametric opposite to totalitarian or authoritarian central control.
``Ask anyone in the West: Capitalism produces the constantly
revolutionary society.''
   Only temporarily, he says, are central control and capitalism
reconcilable. ``Your leaders are now yielding to the realization of
which is the greater force.''

<HEAD>Church Council Threatened By Financial Crunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hard financial times have hit the National
Council of Churches, and officers say it's going to have to change
its ways to keep going.
   ``I don't think it's going to fold,'' said Joyce Sohl, who chairs
the finance committee of the country's largest ecumenical
organization. ``But it can't keep doing the same as it's doing now.
It has to change what it's doing to bring it in line with what it
can afford.''
   Measures to deal with the financial crisis were to be considered
at meetings of a special coordinating group this weekend and of the
council's governing board Nov. 1-4 in Tarrytown, N.Y.
   The 260 board members represent the 32 denominations making up
the council, including most major Protestant and Eastern Orthodox
bodies. They total about 40 million members.
   While the budgetary squeeze is described as severe and
threatening, an oft-repeated view is that the National Council, even
if dismantled, would have to be immediately recreated.
   ``There is too much work that the churches need to do together,''
said Ms. Sohl, a United Methodist from New York.
   Several factors brought on the crunch, notably either stagnant or
reduced denominational allocations to the council, which
historically have lagged behind inflation and rising costs.
   Also, because monies received are needed at once instead of going
temporarily into an investment fund, interest dropped sharply.
   Beyond that, controversy over increased levies on Church World
Service, the council's big relief agency, to support council general
services has caused some denominations to quit channeling relief
funds through CWS.
   The council ``is shooting itself in the foot,'' said Patricia
Rumer of the United Church of Christ, which has halted routing of
relief money through CWS for the time being.
   CWS, with relief operations around the world, is by far the
council's largest operation, taking up about 70 percent of a $52.9
million net budget.
   The Rev. Arie R. Brouwer, the council's general secretary and
chief administrator, says part of the trouble seems to be
disenchantment within some mainline denominations that are mainstays
of the council.
   Several of them, such as the Presbyterian Church (USA), the
Episcopal Church, the United Methodist Church and the United Church
of Christ have all suffered membership losses in recent years.
   Since its founding in 1950, the council has been a regular target
of conservative groups, which have criticized it for stands on
social issues, but such attacks have waned and were not considered
crucial to the financial difficulties.
   However, with denominational concerns turning inward, taking
precedence over ecumenical activities, the council has been been
forced steadily to cut staff and program, most sharply in recent
years.
   The current professional staff of 83 is expected to be cut to 61
for 1989.
   Previously, that staff total had dropped from 187 in 1968 to 105
in 1975.
   The council's associated mission medical office, a New York unit
that provides medical evaluations of missionaries before and after
overseas service, is to cease operations Dec. 31.
   But plans were under way to create a new medical office in
Baltimore in conjunction with Johns Hopkins Hospital, which would
assume the medical reviews of missionaries.
   Other new cutbacks include eliminating CWS' family life and
population program, closing the council development office and
merging its national and international disaster-response offices.

   Bishops of six of the 99 dioceses of the
Episcopal Church have denounced the election in Boston last month of
the Rev. Barbara Harris to be the first female bishop in the
world-wide Anglican communion.
   The Episcopal Church is one of 28 national branches of that
communion.
   Declaring that the Anglican faith would be ``irrreparably
compromised'' if Harris were consecrated a bishop, the six bishops
said they ``cannot accept the validity of ordinations or
confirmations she administers.''
   Her consecration is not expected before next February. A few
parish rectors in the Massachusetts dioceses have said they would
not recognize a woman as bishop.
   Roman Catholic J. Francis Stafford of Denver, head of the
bishops' ecumenical affairs committee, said a woman's becoming an
Anglican bishop would hinder the ``process of reconciliation'' with
Roman Catholicism.

   The City of Light sits on a subterranean city of
darkness, a vast network of stone quarries that has given refuge to
scoundrels, saints and the bones of 6 million souls. It is where the
Phantom of the Opera set up house. Here is a report by an AP
Correspondent who visited the catacombs.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Phantom was laid to rest long ago in the cellars
of the Opera, but figures nearly as macabre still haunt the
catacombs that wind through the belly of Paris like entrails and
conceal millions of human bones.
   Each weekend, dozens of people slip out of their city skins and
into the maze on which the city rests. They descend as far as 90
feet into a world where night is eternal, the unexpected waits at
each turn and the game is to the fearless.
   Some are history buffs seeking the dank breath of ancient Paris,
others are adventurers and still others inhabit a marginal world
whether above ground or below.
   They are called ``cataphiles'' and are drawn, as if by
enchantment, to the darkness beneath the City of Light. They tread
in the footsteps of sorcerers, bandits, smugglers, the quick and the
sly who haunted the tunnels centuries ago.
   Many who spend time below use nicknames _ ``Destroy,''
``Calamity'' or ``Professor Sato'' _ and dress in exaggerated punk
or skinhead style.
   The eternal, eerie silence and stillness enclose a voyager who
weaves through the sand-colored maze of galleries, rooms, nooks and
niches as if pulled along by the flashlight beam.
   Fossils of ancient creatures are imbedded in walls nicked by the
pickaxes of workers long dead. Minuscule stalactites have formed on
the dripping ceilings of what once were quarries for the limestone
that built Paris, most of them worked in the Middle Ages.
   During World War II, the catacombs were bunkers for the German
occupiers and hideouts for the French Resistance. They have been a
blessing to mushroom growers who harvested tons of ``champignons de
Paris'' each day from the murky gardens.
   ``It's a milieu that is such an anachronism compared with the
rest of the capital,'' said Inspector Jean-Claude Saratte, director
of police operations in the catacombs.
   It has been against the law to go underground since 1955 because
of risks both to travelers and the city's foundations, but Saratte
said: ``It's an adventure ... so everyone goes down, from sons of
Cabinet ministers to little punks.''
   Quarries of Lutecian limestone running under southern Paris, just
a corner of the 188 miles of accessible catacombs, are assigned to
the dead. The galleries are lined with the skulls and other bones of
6 million people, some guillotined in the French Revolution but most
merely overflow from the crowded cemeteries of Paris.
   Anne-Marie Leparmentier, a geologist with the General Inspection
of the Quarries, the city agency in charge since the 18th century,
said a ``reserve'' of bones is kept in other sections of the
quarries, but ``sometimes a skull disappears'' now that the
cataphiles have come.
   People have had regular access since the last century to the bone
caverns at the Place Denfert-Rochereau in southern Paris and regular
tours are conducted. The rest of the catacombs are reached by
manhole, under cover of darkness, down a steel ladder to another
world.
   Going underground became a fad more than a decade ago when
students of the Ecole Nationale des Mines nearly made it a ritual.
   ``We ended up spending days finding people lost inside,'' Saratte
said, so all but eight of about 300 accesses to the catacombs have
been soldered shut.
   The quarries are the lowest level of subterranean Paris, which
also is honeycombed with subway lines and 1,313 miles of navigable
sewers. The vast underworld inspired Victor Hugo, and later Gaston
Leroux, whose ``Phantom of the Opera'' hid out in ``that infernal
underground maze.''
   Around one corner is a bath carved into the rock by quarry
workers centuries ago, around the next an open well that may descend
to the center of Earth. Around still another, ``Lost in the catas.
Help!'' is scrawled on the wall.
   Some writings reek of threat or foreboding: ``This is the domain
of the Klan,'' ``Avenue of the Black Mass,'' ``I'm Dead.''
   A shuffling sound comes from a corridor nearby. The path forks
and the swamp route beckons. Travelers slosh through the ancient mud
of Lutecia, as Paris was called in Roman times.
   Eras collide in the catacombs.
   Punks, skinheads and weekend revelers hold all-night seances. In
Room Z, a large, confusing, amorphous cavity reached by slithering
on the stomach through a narrow tunnel, the walls are scrolls of
obscenities, swastikas and death wails.
   Subterranean Paris is ``a very particular little world, a little
planet all its own'' where groups of regulars establish zones of
influence, said Saratte, the police inspector.
   Philip, who uses only his first name, said: ``This world is
divided into two races, the tourists and the cataphiles. The
tourists are a hated race. ... You have to do everything to chase
them out.''
   ``Actually, it is a rather hostile milieu'' where ``criminals
don't think of hiding out, said Michel Laroche, another geologist
for the city quarries agency.
   Since the beginning, the quarries of Paris have attracted those
either in hiding or in search of the celestial or the damned.
   St. Denis, patron saint of France, said Mass in the quarries
during the Christian persecution, according to Simon Lacordaire's
book ``The Secret History of Subterranean Paris.''
   Some 13th century bandits hid under the Chateau de Vauvert,
replaced long ago by the Luxembourg Gardens, Lacordaire said.
Sorcerers used the quarries for black masses, especially during the
1348 plague that filled the Paris cemeteries and caused the living
to search for solace in the occult.
   In the last century, merchants used the catacombs to smuggle
untaxed black-market goods to clients.
   Official concern now centers on preserving the natural beauty of
the quarries and fears that unauthorized travelers will harm the
city foundations.
   ``There have always been cataphiles, but perhaps in the past they
were more respectful,'' Laroche said. ``It is not a sacred place,
but it is our patrimony.''
   Over-ambitious excavations weakened the subterranean
infrastructure. There were reports a century ago of the earth
swallowing homes on the Boulevard St. Michel and neighboring
streets. Laroche said the last fatal accident was a 1961 cave-in at
Clamart, a southern suburb, that killed 20 people.
   Authorities began mapping and reinforcing the quarries in the
mid-18th century and do so today when the need arises. Quarrying has
been prohibited since 1788.

   No job is perfect, not even being a member of
Congress. But once you're there, it's a difficult job to give up.
   No member of the freshman class of 1986 plans to leave
voluntarily.
   Freshmen congressmen cite the slow-moving seniority system, the
unpredictable floor schedule and canceled airplane reservations and
speaking engagements as some of the headaches that go with the job.
But along with that is the satisfaction of being a party to major
pieces of legislation.
   Here are some impressions from five freshmen:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Guys who control the place have been here 25, 30, 35, 40 years
and for a young guy coming in, boy, that's a long time,'' said Rep.
J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
   Hastert, 46, served in the state Legislature where he became
minority spokesman on the House Appropriations Committee. The husky,
affable former teacher and restaurateur likes Congress but at times
recalls a bit wistfully the statehouse clout he surrendered to get
here.
   ``I could pick up a phone and have the director of children and
family services, public health or public aid in my office in five
minutes if I needed help or to work with a problem,'' he reminisced.
   These days, ``I pick up the phone and go through the hierarchy,''
Hastert says. ``It's just a bigger place. You can't be in
everybody's office in five minutes. I realize that.''
   Still, he finds himself troubled by ``the time people bide here
before they have a big impact on their committees.''
   To Hastert, the highlight of his first two years in Congress was
the budget summit at which lawmakers agreed on a formula to curb
spending. But he says cutting the deficit remains a major challenge.
   ``Otherwise, I think we're headed for a fiscal train wreck.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It's true that Rep. Tom McMillan, D-Md., has an easier time
getting home than Midwestern lawmakers who must scramble to keep
airplane reservations when floor sessions meander unexpectedly into
the night.
   But McMillan, a former professional basketball player, said
representing a district just 30 minutes from the Capitol doesn't
ease the hectic pace.
   ``The proximity of my district to Washington doubles it,'' he
said, as he is often expected to be in two places at once.
   ``You plan lots of things in your district assuming that you'll
be out of session at reasonable hours or that you won't be in
session on a certain day. And then all of a sudden that changes and
there are very difficult things to cancel.''
   Sending an aide to apologize to impatient constituents is a risky
move for a lawmaker who won his seat by just 428 votes.
   To make the strain even worse, McMillan had vowed to compile a
100 percent attendance record on votes _ a rarity even among the
most conscientious congressmen. The House sometimes takes
meaningless procedural votes, such as approving the previous day's
journal, and lawmakers secure about re-election sometimes pass up
such time-consuming formalities.
   McMillan achieved that 100 percent record this term but says it
can't last forever.
   The one-time Rhodes scholar began his term by being elected
president of the Democratic freshman class. ``There aren't many jobs
in the world where you can work on issues of such great diversity,''
McMillan said.
   But he finds himself chafing at times by the slowness with which
Capitol Hill changes its longstanding traditions.
   ``I think they could move this institution more toward the 20th
century,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, was best known as The Love Boat's
Gopher Smith when he asked Iowa voters to send him to the House. He
assured them, though, that ``there's a long-pants version of Fred
Grandy.''
   Two years later, the Harvard-educated former actor said he has
been ``pleasantly surprised because there's an old rubric that says
a freshman's main goal is to get re-elected and you should be seen
and not heard and there's very little you can accomplish.''
   Not true, the 40-year-old former Capitol Hill aide said after two
years on the House Agriculture Committee.
   ``I've worked on every major piece of legislation that has come
out of the ag committee, including working on three major
conferences, drought, credit and trade bill,'' he says.
   Not that any freshman was a prime mover in fashioning those
bills. But seniority-heavy lawmakers once known as the ``Old Bulls''
of Capitol Hill are more willing to let newcomers participate, said
Grandy.
   ``I just hope that I'm always a Young Turk and never become an
Old Bull,'' he added.
   And the hours?
   ``For anybody who lives west of, I think Ohio, this is a killer
schedule.''

<TEXT>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., came to Capitol Hill early in 1987
to fill a vacancy. The daughter of a one-time Maryland congressman
and long on the fringes of national politics, the newest freshman
found no surprises.
   ``Surprise is a word that for politicians and people in public
life is a very rare occurrence,'' said Pelosi, whose district
encompasses all but a sliver of San Francisco. ``You hope for the
best, you prepare for the worst and you are very rarely surprised.''
   What would she change? A long pause.
   ``Actually,'' she said. ``I have a lot of respect for this
institution.
   ``It's true, it would be easier if we had more certainty about
the schedule, but it's in the nature of the place and I like the
fast pace and I can cope with it,'' she said. ``There are all kinds
of ways to get a job done.''
   High on her agenda was federal assistance for AIDS victims. She
applauds congressional approval of such a bill.
   ``I feel very pleased about that because of what it will mean for
people infected with the AIDS virus,'' she said. ``And there is
plenty more to do.''

<TEXT>
   Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., won 224 games as a major league pitcher,
including a pair of no hitters. He came to Washington from the
Kentucky Senate.
   Any surprises?
   ``It's only the numbers,'' Bunning said. ``You have to add three
zeros to everything.''
   He did find himself a bit disappointed in ``the lack of input.''
   ``I think the committee chairman and the ranking member seem to
have more control than they ought to,'' Bunning said. ``That is, not
much legislation is altered at the full committee level and
particularly in Banking.''
   In the Banking Committee, he said, ``there wasn't much you could
do, even if you tried your darndest and I tried in certain
instances.''
   Would he change anything?
   Bunning cited proxy voting in committees _ a practice under which
senior lawmakers collect the ``proxies'' of absent members and vote
them on bills and amendments.
   Without proxy voting, he said, ``you would have to show up and
vote ... and the committee chairman could not vote 15 proxies who
were absent and just work his will on everything.''
   He said it was hard to put his finger on any single high point
over the last two years. ``I'm a well-trained professional who
doesn't get too high or too low,'' he said. ``That comes from my
athletic background, I believe, where some you win, some you lose
and some get rained out.''

   Isadore Sharp, founder and chairman of the Four
Seasons luxury hotel chain, isn't troubled by the growing
competition at the top end of the market.
   ``We've evolved over 25 years,'' he said in an interview at
corporate headquarters here. ``They look at us and copy a lot of
what we've done.''
   Indeed, the move by several major hotel chains into the luxury
market has actually helped Four Seasons by putting huge advertising
budgets to work promoting quality and whetting the public's appetite
for the kind of services that have made a name for Sharp.
   ``We decided a long time ago what we thought was going to be our
strength,'' the trim and fit executive said. ``The other companies
still don't do it _ and that's the service. It's the consistency and
quality of the people you hire.''
   Four Seasons _ with 21 properties in Canada, the United States
and England _ has helped set the standards by which the luxury hotel
business is judged these days. Among the amenities it introduced are
concierge service, twice-daily maid service, formal afternoon tea
and full secretarial and translation services.
   The company also has emphasized fitness for its guests, both in
health centers and in its menus that feature an ``alternative
cuisine'' lower in calories, cholesterol and sodium.
   In testament to its efforts, Four Seasons hotels claimed more
``Five Diamond'' ratings from the American Automobile Association
this year than any of its competitors.
   Sharp recalled fondly the origins of his business at the outset
of the 1960s with a small Toronto motel.
   Although he studied architecture, he was working in construction
and built a 14-room motel for a client.
   ``It sparked an interest, I guess, in the idea,'' said Sharp, in
shirt sleeves. ``The idea comes quickly ... yet something finally
concrete took six, seven years.
   ``You never anticipate that it's going to take you that long.''
   His first hotel opened in 1961 in what was then a somewhat
marginal downtown neighborhood, so he designed it to look inward and
create a comfortable interior environment.
   ``My idea was that it had to be something distinctive,'' he said.
``The idea of it married the motel feel with hotel services.''
   Sharp said the basic principles remain the same today.
   ``Each step along the way carried with it that same idea, of
giving the customer something that was special,'' he said.
   Sharp's office, flooded with natural light, is a stunning example
of his ability to combine comfort and style. Although the office is
sparsely furnished, each piece makes an impact from the large, red
and blue Oriental rug to his imposing desk. He took obvious pride in
showing off the entire headquarters building, located in a renovated
printing shop down the street from the chain's modern Inn on the
Park.
   As Four Seasons grew, Sharp said he realized that it was
acquiring a motley collection, everything from his first motel to a
giant convention property since divested.
   ``It wasn't until 1972 that I decided to concentrate on one end
of the market totally, and to make sure that all the hotels would be
consistent,'' he said.
   Decisions since then have been made carefully. Sharp said, for
example, that Four Seasons spent 10 years looking at New York before
entering the market there with the Pierre on Fifth Avenue.
   ``You make a list of all the cities that you consider primary
destinations of the business traveler,'' he said. ``I guess what I
was able to do was not just grab and take everything.''
   He said expansion also has been cautious so that retreat is
possible if problems crop up.
   ``We'll take it slowly,'' he said. ``We're not going to do more
if it jeopardizes the existing operation.''
   His goal for the next five years is to open at least two hotels
annually.
   ``Where we'll go over time is the world _ literally,'' he said.
   Four Seasons is moving slowly into resorts. Its Maui resort is
scheduled to open late next year, and Sharp said he believes about a
half dozen are possible in North America.
   The company also is entering the Far East, in partnership with a
Japanese company, and the first Four Seasons hotel should open in
Tokyo in 1991.
   ``There's nothing driving Four Seasons other than to do the right
thing for the company,'' Sharp said.
   Industry analysts say Four Seasons is well-positioned, generally
enjoying the highest occupancy rates in its cities and often
charging the highest rates as well.
   Sharp said the chain's yield factor, or occupancy rate multiplied
by room rate, is ``substantially more'' than the competition.
   ``As a company we are the largest operator of luxury hotels in
the world,'' he said. ``There isn't another company that is as
obsessed with customer satisfaction and consistency. ... We sell
what we can guarantee we can do all the time.''
   The corporation announced earnings of $5.3 million for the first
six months of this year, up 14.6 percent from $4.6 million in the
first half of 1987.

   Charles Haid's longtime hobby of doing accents
came in handy when he was cast as an Australian soldier in the NBC
miniseries ``The Great Escape: Return With a Vengeance.''
   He plays Sgt. Mac MacKenzie in the four-hour, two-part series
that is a sequel to the blockbuster 1963 movie about the true story
of a huge escape of Allied airmen from a German prisoner-of-war camp
in World War II.
   ``He's a combination of a couple of guys,'' said Haid. ``Mostly a
Scot, who's still alive but was conveniently changed to an Aussie
for television. My character was a tunnel digger. Moles, they called
them.
   ``We filmed in Yugoslavia with a lot of British actors. My
biggest challenge was fitting in with their dialects. My hobby is
doing accents. I've been fascinated by accents since I was a kid. I
have a kind of parrot ear. Mostly what I did was listen to tapes.
Then all of a sudden,'' slipping into an Australian accent, ``you're
talkin' like that.''
   ``The Great Escape'' sequel will be broadcast by NBC on Sunday
and Monday, Nov. 6-7.
   Besides Haid, who starred as Officer Andy Renko for seven years
on ``Hill Street Blues,'' the movie also features Christopher Reeved Fields
to about
29.6 percent.
   Minorco issued a statement saying it was considering its position
in the light of the British government's decision.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young asked the monopolies commission to
report to him within the three months.
   The British investigation will center on the proposed takeover's
impact on strategic metals, in particular titanium and zircon, a
spokesman at the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   Titanium, a metal largely used as a whitener in paints, also is
used in jet engines, a Consolidated Gold Fields metallurgist said.
Zircon is mainly used as a refracting agent in glass and steel
furnaces, but is also a critical substance in nuclear submarines and
power plants, and in rocket nose cones, he said.
   Consolidated Gold Fields says that Australian-based Renison
Goldfields Consolidated Ltd., in which it has a 49 percent stake, is
the world's largest producer of mineral sands that serve as raw
materials for titanium and zircon.
   Consolidated Gold Fields' shares plummeted on news of the
investigation, while Minorco's shares rose.

   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. says it plans to

stockholders.
   Kohlberg Kravis said it would offer $90 a share in cash for
about 87 percent of RJR Nabisco's 225.3 million outstanding shares
and would exchange securities valued at the same amount for the

   Kraft Inc. says it will give advance notice if
it decides to proceed with any part of its $13.6 billion defensive
restructuring without the approval of its directors and
shareholders.
   Kraft's statement in federal court in Chicago on Monday marked a
victory for the company pursuing Kraft, Philip Morris Cos. Inc.,
which had sought a temporary restraining order requiring three
days' notice of any restructuring moves.
   U.S. District Judge James B. Moran rejected Philip Morris's
request for a temporary restraining order, saying it was unneeded
because of Kraft's agreement to give advance notice to the court.

   The suit could affect about 5,000 workers at Morrell plants, the

   Worries about a continuing oversupply of oil
following another failed OPEC meeting could further erode prices
this week, analysts say.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, tumbled $1.20 a barrel on Monday, finishing the day at
$13.17 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   On Friday, the near-term contract had finished at $14.37 per
barrel, off 7 cents for the week.
   The sharp drop in crude oil dragged down the prices of refined
products as well. The November contract for unleaded gasoline
dropped 1.26 cents to finish at 49.96 cents a gallon, with other
contract months down as much as 2 cents a gallon. The heating oil
contract for November closed down 2.81 cents, to a settlement price
of 39.90 cents a gallon, with other contract months also down
sharply.
   Analysts said the crude price erosion reflected investor worries
that OPEC would continue flooding world markets with oil, pushing
prices down even further.
   Since April, prices have fallen more than 25 percent due to the
growing oversupply of oil.
   Prices for the December crude contract opened almost 90 cents
lower than Friday's close after ministers from eight Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries adjourned a weekend meeting
without reaching common ground on production quotas.
   Oil brokers said investors had hoped this weekend's OPEC meeting
in Madrid would produce a new production accord that would reduce
daily output by as much as 3 million barrels. Prices had firmed
slightly last week in anticipation of a positive outcome.
   ``Expectations were so high that in fact an agreement would take
place, that when it didn't take place the market sold off,'' said
Nauman Barakat, vice president for energy investments with
Prudential Bache Securities Inc.
   The 13-nation cartel produces an estimated 22 million barrels of
oil a day, exceeding its self-imposed ceiling by more than 3
million barrels. Observers said before the meeting that the
ministers planned to set a daily ceiling of 17.4 million barrels.
   Iraq is said to be the principal problem, refusing to abide by
its 1.6 million barrel-a-day quota since 1986. Iraq is producing
approximately 2.7 million barrels a day, arguing that it needs the
oil revenue to rebuild its shattered economy after its eight-year
war with Iran. The two countries began a cease-fire in August.
   Analysts say other quota violators fear that if they roll back
their own production, Iraq will take over their market share.
   Recently, Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC producer and the
world's largest exporter, began exceeding its 4.3 million-barrel
quota, reportedly to punish the other quota violators.
   But analysts say OPEC's failure to reach any kind of a
resolution this weekend suggested the cartel is far from
reinstituting discipline among its members.
   ``The fact that the meeting ended without a firm resolution
confirmed the existing fundamentals _ that there is too much oil on
world markets and prices have to go lower,'' said James Steel, an
analyst with Refco Inc.
   OPEC ministers plan two more meetings in November, including a
full ministerial gathering on Nov. 21 in Vienna.

   The fevered pitch of Wall Street's bidding for
giant food companies could go even higher following Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co.'s record $20.28 billion offer for RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Kohlberg Kravis' announcement Monday of a $90-a-share leveraged
buyout offer for RJR Nabisco came four days after Nabisco's
management said it might offer $17 billion, or $75 a share, to buy
the company from stockholders.
   ``Our offer is a better one,'' stated Henry Kravis, a partner in
the New York-based investment firm.
   Securities analysts said the Kohlberg Kravis offer was more in
line with Nabisco's worth than the proposal presented by
management, and say higher offers still may emerge.
   ``There's a possibility this will be the final bid, but it could
go as high as $100,'' said Jay Nelson, an analyst with Brown
Brothers Harriman Inc. ``It's feasible, but not at all certain.''
   New York-based Kohlberg Kravis said it would offer $90 a share
in cash for about 87 percent of RJR Nabisco's 225.3 million
outstanding shares, and would exchange securities valued at the
same amount for the rest of the company's stock.
   The offer was was conditioned on support from Nabisco's board.
   The investment firm, known for its big, successful leveraged
buyout bids, said it would begin the tender offer formally later
this week. At more than $20 billion, the offer would surpass the
biggest corporate acquisition of any type, the $13.4 billion
purchase of Gulf Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.
   There was no comment from RJR Nabisco or the managers who on
Thursday announced they were considering a $75-a-share cash bid for
the food and tobacco company.
   On Wall Street, investors reacted enthusastically to Kohlberg
Kravis's offer. Nabisco stock shot up $7.25 a share to $84 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Ronald B. Morrow, who tracks Nabisco for the investment firm
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said he doubted the management
group, led by Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson, would be disturbed
by the Kohlberg Kravis bid.
   ``They were definitely inviting offers,'' he said.
   Clinton Mayer, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. Inc., said of
the Johnson group, ``They're in a no-lose situation.''
   ``I think if they could buy at $75, they would have been
happy,'' Mayer said, but also said ``they would be very happy if
someone else bid a higher price.''
   Kohlberg Kravis had been expected to enter the whirlwind of bids
for food companies that began Oct. 4 with a $5.23 billion bid for
Pillsbury Co. by Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British company.
   But many thought the investment firm was considering a bid for
Kraft Inc., which late Sunday rejected a more than $11 billion bid
from Philip Morris Cos. Inc. and announced its own $13.59 billion
recapitalization plan.
   A successful buyout of Nabisco would be the biggest leveraged
buyout of an American corporation by far. The largest LBO was
Kohlberg Kravis' $6.1 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos. in 1986.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with
borrowed funds that are repaid either with company revenue or money
raised by selling parts of the operation.
   Henry Kravis, a partner in the investment firm, said in a
statement his company had raised an equity pool of $5.6 billion for
buyouts. Experts say that amount could be used to ``leverage'' as
much as $40 billion in loans for acquisitions.
   Kohlberg Kravis also is leading a group attempting to acquire
the publishing giant Macmillan Inc. for $2.5 billion. British
publisher Robert Maxwell, who also seeks to buy Macmillan, is
fighting that bid in a Delaware court.
   The investment firm recently withdrew a $5.03 billion bid for
supermarket operator Kroger Co. after Kroger's board rejected the
offer in favor of a financial restructuring.
   Past Kohlberg leveraged buyouts also include the 1986 purchase
of Safeway Stores Inc. for $4.2 billion, the 1987 buyout of
Owens-Illinois Inc. for $3.7 billion, the purchase of Storer
Communications Inc. for $2.5 billion in 1985, and the buyout of
Stop & Shop Cos. earlier this year for $1.23 billion.

   Industry analysts see Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.'s move to lay off about 1,000 people while aggressively
pursuing multibillion-dollar takeover deals as reflecting profound
changes on post-crash Wall Street and signaling a new wave of
cutbacks because of the depressed outlook for stocks.
   ``This is the beginning of the second round,'' said Perrin Long,
who follows the business for Lipper Analytical Securities in New
York.
   He estimated the number of securities industry layoffs
nationwide, which reached more than 15,000 in the months following
the October 1987 crash, could hit 25,000 by the end of this year,
or about 9.6 percent of the total 260,000.
   Worried about a continued slump in stock trading, Shearson laid
off about 200 people earlier this month and expects the total to
reach 1,000 by year's end, officials of the brokerage said Monday.
   Shearson already has accounted for about one-third of
crash-related layoffs, largely because of its acquisition of the
distressed E.F. Hutton Group Inc. late last year for nearly $1
billion.
   But the company last week hinted at further reductions in its
staff of 42,000 employees, when it reported an 85 percent tumble in
its third-quarter profit.
   Shearson officials said the latest round of layoffs would affect
all operations, but it was clear that retail brokerage would be
affected most. Analysts said that side of the business requires a
lot more support staff, such as computer operators and billing
clerks, than other areas.
   On the other hand, financing takeover deals, the most frenzied
part of the investment business, requires relatively few people and
is the most profitable.
   ``What you've got here is a one-legged man,'' said James P.
Hanbury, who follows the industry for Wertheim Schroder & Co., a
New York investment firm. ``M&A is red hot, while most other lines
of business are the opposite.''
   Shearson, the second biggest U.S. brokerage behind Merrill Lynch
& Co., has become an aggressive financier of corporate takeovers
and restructurings.
   It is adviser to management of RJR Nabisco Inc., which surprised
Wall Street last week by announcing it might try to buy the
food-tobacco conglomerate for $17 billion in a leveraged buyout.
   Shearson would reap staggering profits if the management buyout
succeeded, although the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. entered the fray Monday with a $20.28 billion bid.
   Shearson also has played key roles in other huge takeover deals
over the past year. It represented Eastman Kodak Co. in a $5.1
billion takeover of Sterling Drug Co.; it advised Federated
Department Stores, target of an intense bidding war won by Canadian
developer Robert Campeau, who paid $6.58 billion; and it helped
takeover strategest Paul Bilzerian buy Singer Co. for $1 billion.
   Figures compiled by IDD Information Services, an investment
industry research and publishing concern in New York, show Shearson
ranked first during the first half of this year in number of
takeover deals, at 105.
   IDD said Shearson ranked fourth in terms of the dollar value of
these deals at $41.95 billion, behind Goldman, Sachs & Co. at
$44.94 billion, Morgan Stanley Group Inc. at $45.42 billion and
First Boston Inc. at $54.92 billion.
   ``Shearson's like any of us, we take advantage of our
opportunities,'' said Long. ``The LBO game and M&A business have
been going at a furious pace, and as a consequence, the firm's
attention is being diverted to areas where it can make money.''
   Some Wall Street professionals noted the irony that Shearson,
which used a major post-crash advertising blitz to urge a long-term
investment strategy, was diverting its own resources to speculative
deal-making.
   Others called Shearson's strategy a necessary adjustment for
long-term survival.
   ``It's like General Motors cutting back on Caddies during a
downturn and hiring people in the Chevrolet division,'' said Long.

<HEAD>Maytag Buying Maker Of Hoover Vacuum Cleaners For $1 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER MUNNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maytag Corp.'s proposed $1 billion
buyout of Chicago Pacific Corp., the maker of Hoover appliances, is
a positive but expensive move for Maytag, according to some
industry watchers.
   While the price the Newton-based company plans to pay for
Chicago Pacific is seen by some as a bit high, the takeover will
give it entry into European markets while helping insulate it from
any unwanted takeover.
   ``The fit is excellent, although the price is a bit high,'' said
Mark Hassenberg, of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, Inc.,
in New York.
   Maytag said Monday it would launch a cash tender offer of $60 a
share for up to 6.4 million shares, or about 49 percent of the
outstanding shares, of Chicago Pacific. The remaining Chicago
Pacific shares will be converted into an equivalent amount of
Maytag stock.
   The companies said the tender offer and the merger together are
valued at about $1 billion. The combined sales of both companies
would exceed $3 billion.
   Hassenberg predicted that the buyout would erode Maytag's
earnings by as much as 25 cents a share next year but said the
company would regain that ground in 1990.
   He said Hoover has an ``outstanding position'' in Europe and
Maytag should be able to use that reputation to introduce its own
line of major appliances.
   ``Through Chicago Pacific's Hoover division, we will become a
leader in the international major appliance market,'' said Maytag
chairman Daniel J. Krumm in a prepared statement.
   He said the acquisition was a milestone for Maytag because it
``provides increased opportunities for our shareowners and helps us
achieve our long-term strategy of becoming a global leader in the
major appliance field.''
   Maytag shares finished down $2.75 at $23.75 a share Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange. Chicago Pacific shares zoomed up
$13.25 to $56.62{ a share.
   The board of directors of Chicago Pacific, including Chicago
businessman Lester Crown whose family is the company's largest
shareholder with 15 percent, has approved the transaction, a news
release from the companies said. Crown intends to exchange his
family's stock and convertible bond holdings to Maytag stock, the
release said.
   While investors drove Maytag's value down at the news of the
deal, several analysts praised the combination as a long-term plus
for the company. Other analysts said the deal signals that Maytag
intends to fight off any takeover bids.
   ``For investors looking for a Maytag takeover, it wasn't very
positive news,'' said Tim Dunn, an analyst for the Provident
National Bank of Philadelphia. ``But that's OK with me. Hoover is a
quality asset, with the most interesting thing coming from their
position internationally.
   ``This won't put them (Maytag) in the league with Whirlpool or
General Electric, but it was the most they could do. It's a very
positive move,'' said Dunn.
   Another analyst, James Ballessa of the D.A. Davidson & Co., of
Great Falls, Mont., said Maytag was hoping to make itself less
attractive as a takeover prospect.
   ``I know the company has anti-takeover provisions in its bylaws,
but they may have wanted to add a wart to make themselves less
attractive to a suitor. It's possible this is a wart. I don't
understand the logic,'' he said.
   Maytag's prime appliance brands are Admiral, Hardwick, Jenn-Air,
Magic Chef, Norge and Maytag. It also makes vending machines.
   In addition to Hoover, Chicago Pacific has several lines of
furniture, including Kittinger, Pennsylvania House, McGuire, Brown
Jordan and Gunlocke.
   Hoover has 13 production facilities in eight countries to
manufacture and distribute washers, dryers, refrigerators,
dishwashers and microwave ovens in addition to the floor care line.
It does not market the major appliances in the United Statesm, and
gets about 65 percent of its revenue overseas.
   Chicago Pacific is the successor of the Rock Island Railroad,
which emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in 1984.

<HEAD>Griffin To Hire Harrah's President To Head Resorts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of Resorts International
Inc. to Merv Griffin could conclude within the week, according to
the multimillionaire businessman and entertainer.
   Also on Monday, Griffin announced he had hired the president of
rival Harrah's Marina Hotel and Casino to run Resorts.
   Griffin said he expects to complete the purchase of the gaming
and real estate company from developer Donald Trump on or around
Nov. 3.
   Griffin will acquire Resorts International's casinos in Atlantic
City and the Bahamas, and will sell Resorts' unfinished Taj Majal
casino project in Atlantic City back to Trump.
   This week, Griffin is visiting several cities around the country
to raise investor interest in a $325 million bond issue needed to
finance his purchase of Resorts.
   Trump said Monday that the financing ``really is the only
obstacle to closing the deal.''
   But Thomas E. Gallagher, the New York attorney representing
Griffin, said the only roadblocks were final approval from Bahamian
gaming regulators and ``a lot of documentation on the actual
closing...''
   The New Jersey Casino Control Commission has granted Griffin
interim authorization to own and operate Resorts International's
Atlantic City gaming hall until he can get a plenary license. The
commission also approved Griffin's plans to split the company with
Trump.
   Trump would be paid $63 million to break his lucrative
management contract with the casino company. He then would pay
Griffin $273 million to buy back the Taj Mahal.
   Griffin will pay the Resorts Class A stockholders $36 a share _
or about $205 million. He will pay Trump $135 a share for his
controlling block of Class B shares, which have 100 times the
voting power of the Class A stock _ a total of $96 million.
   To run the new Resorts operation, Griffin announced Monday he
would hire David Hanlon.
   Hanlon, 43, has been president of Harrah's East, a subsidiary of
the Holiday Corp., for the past four years. Before that, he worked
for Caesar's World Inc. He could not be reached for comment Monday.
   Nina Andro, a spokeswoman for Griffin's operations in Los
Angeles, said Monday that Hanlon ``has consistently been one of the
top three operators in Atlantic City. Harrah's has been called the
most successful bottom-line operation on the East Coast.''
   The future of I.G. ``Jack'' Davis, Resorts International's
current president, ``will be discussed with Jack over the next few
days,'' Gallagher said.
   Davis has been president of Resorts since 1960 and has a
multiyear contract with the company for $1 million annually.
   Trump said that once the Resorts deal is complete, construction
will resume on the Taj Mahal and the 1,250-room complex could open
14 or 15 months later, indicating a March 1990 grand opening.

<HEAD>Farley Offers $1.4 Billion For Pepperell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Farley Inc. says his company's $1.41
billion takeover bid for textile giant West Point-Pepperell Inc. is
generous but industry analysts says a buyout probably will be more
expensive than that.
   Farley, the Chicago-based parent of Fruit of the Loom Inc. and
one of the nation's largest privately owned conglomerates, said it
would pay $48 a share in cash for each of Pepperell's 29.4 million
outstanding shares.
   ``It's (Pepperell) worth more,'' said Grace Taferner, an analyst
with First Manhattan Co. in New York. ``I think it should be about
$55 per share.''
   Patricia Ryan, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla., also termed $55 a share as ``a good number,'' but
added ``I don't think you make your best bid first.''
   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Pepperell rose
$4.75 a share to $50, indicating speculators expected a higher
offer to be made.
   Pepperell advised its stockholders not to take any action on the
bid until the board of directors reviewed Farley's bid and made a
recommendation, said Donald Downs, a company spokesman. He said the
board would meet by Nov. 4.
   ``We think it's an attractive offer to the shareholders for
sure,'' said William Farley, who heads Farley Inc., in an interview
Monday after announcing the offer.
   Farley said in a letter to Pepperell Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Joseph L. Lanier Jr. that he hoped to ``move
forward on a constructive, friendly basis.''
   The offer was not entirely unexpected. In May, Farley sought
government permission to acquire up to 25 percent of Pepperell's
stock. So far, Farley has spent $88 million for a 9.8 percent stake
in the West Point, Ga.-based company.
   Farley said Lanier had telephoned him months ago ``and indicated
he preferred to remain independent.''
   Pepperell, which manufactures Arrow shirts and Martex towels,
acquired textile rival J.P. Stevens & Co. earlier this year for
$1.2 billion and then split up Stevens' assets with a rival suitor.
Pepperell was left with most of Stevens' linen and towel
operations, giving the company about 25 percent of the nation's
home fashion textile market.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
Washington, Farley has said that, if successful in its bid, it
plans to sell Pepperell's apparel fabrics and industrial fabrics
businesses and keep the household fabrics business.
   ``The breakup value is worth more than keeping the company
together,'' Ms. Taferner said. ``He's (Farley) said he wants the
bed and bath business which is the jewel of the company. There are
a lot of buyers for the businesses that he doesn't want. He should
be able to sell them off fairly easily.''
   Farley already has taken legal action to challenge Georgia's
anti-takeover statutes as well as Pepperell's poison pill takever
defense, which was strengthened last June in an effort to make
unwanted takeovers prohibitively expensive.
   The lawsuits would be dropped if Pepperell agrees to work with
Farley on a friendly basis, Farley said.
   Farley has $300 million earmarked for acquisitions, accumulated
from a bond issue earlier this year, but has indicated he wants to
keep two-thirds of it in reserve for other investments.
   In addition to Fruit of the Loom, the nation's largest underwear
company, Farley operates Acme Boot and Doehler-Jarvis.

<HEAD>ITT Pleads Guilty In Air Force Contract Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Corp. faces a maximum $500,000 fine for
pleading guilty to wining and dining Air Force officials in order
to obtain secret government information used to bid on $180 million
in military contracts.
   The New York-based conglomerate pleaded guilty Monday in federal
court to a charge of conspiring to defraud the government.
   The company admitted that an employee of its defense technology
division in 1984 and early 1985 spent about $15,000 and was
reimbursed for illegal gifts _ including liquor, sports and theater
tickets, meals and golf games _ to Air Force officials at Hanscom
Air Force Base in Bedford.
   In exchange, ITT received copies of internal government
documents with confidential procurement information on two Air
Force programs ITT was interested in pursuing.
   ITT was indicted in June 1987, several months before a separate
federal investigation into the use of consultants by corporations
to get information for use in bidding for contracts. ITT officials
said the case was not tied to that investigation.
   ``This office will continue to ferret out and prosecute
vigorously fraud and corruption in the defense industry,'' U.S.
Attorney Frank L. McNamara said in a statement.
   Edward M. Vicenzi, a senior marketing representative of ITT's
Van Nuys, Calif.-based Gilfillan subsidiary, which specializes in
radar technology, pleaded guilty in July to the same charge. He
faces up to 35 years in prison and a $500,000 fine on the charges.
   ``We pleaded guilty to the fact that the person involved was our
employee when he acted improperly,'' ITT Chairman Rand V. Araskog
said in a statement. ``We had no choice because that employee
pleaded guilty.''
   According to the indictment in the case, Vicenzi was hired in
August 1983 to pursue two Air Force contracts _ an anti-radiation
missile decoy system valued at more than $80 million and a mobile
air traffic control radar system worth between $100 million and
$150 million.
   Vicenzi's $60,000-a-year job was to get inside government
information on the programs, including Air Force plans,
specifications, procurement strategy and projected costs, the
indictment said.
   He reportedly had close ties with procurement officials at the
Air Force's Electronics Systems Division at Hanscom, which is
responsible for buying all of the Air Force's electronics systems.
   Four government employees who received gratuities from Vincenzi
gave him copies of documents with information on the contracts as
well as general planning and funding documents, including the
entire minutes of an Air Force meeting for the missile decoy
system, the indictment said.
   He then sent the documents to other ITT Gilfillan employees,
including senior business development officials, engineers and
program managers, writing ``This is extremely sensitive'' or ``Do
not acknowledge our possession of this document.''
   ITT Gilfillan won a preliminary $6.4 million development
contract for the $80 million missile decoy system, which would have
protected U.S. radar sites by luring homing missiles away from a
radar installation, the indictment said. Neither that system nor
the radar control system, known as MPN-XX, was ever built.
   Federal prosecutors told the U.S. District Judge David S. Nelson
that several ITT employees tried to hide Vicenzi's activities by
destroying or concealing the documents after word was out of an
investigation. ITT said Vicenzi was fired in 1986 in an unrelated
matter.
   Vicenzi allegedly had repeated contact with Maurice Raciti, a
deputy program manager in logistics at Hanscom who resigned from
the Air Force in late 1986 after Air Force oficials suspended him
pending the outcome of the federal investigation. Raciti has not
been charged.
   The indictment said Vicenzi on numerous occasions met with
Raciti and ``bought him lunches, paid for him to play golf,
provided him with tickets to sporting and theater events and gave
him gifts of liquor.''
   The Defense Department suspended its business with ITT Gillifan
from July to November 1987 because of the Justice Department
investigation.

   A surge in trading of RJR Nabisco Inc. stock
options during the two days before the announcement of a $17
billion management buyout plan has prompted an investigation by the
Chicago Board Options Exchange.
   The probe was launched last week after CBOE officials noticed a
sharp rise in the number of RJR Nabisco stock options traded last
Tuesday and Wednesday, CBOE spokesman Warren Moulds said Monday.
   Moulds said exchange officials monitor trading through
computerized systems, ``and when it breaks usual trading patterns,
that usually sets in motion an inquiry into the reasons why.''
   A stock option contract is a right to buy or sell 100 shares of
a certain stock at a specified price within a given time period.
The value of RJR Nabisco stock options increased during the two
days prior to the company's announcement.
   In September, only 1,039 contracts of RJR Nabisco options were
traded daily, Moulds said. Last Tuesday, 4,079 contracts were
traded; on Wednesday, the day preceding the announcement, 7,050
contracts were traded.
   After the buyout proposal was made public on Thursday, 25,850
RJR Nabisco options traded on the CBOE, Moulds said.
   After such an announcement, a large increase in trading volume
is normal because the buyout plans often include a large payout to
shareholders that can boost the value of the company's stock.
   But increased trading volume prior to the announcement can
indicate that someone with advance knowledge of the company's plans
was attempting to profit illegally.
   In a new development Monday, the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. said it would begin a $20.28 billion tender offer for
RJR Nabisco.
   The latest CBOE inquiry follows a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation into options trading shortly before Grand
Metropolitan PLC announced a $5.2 billion dollar bid for Pillsbury
Co. earlier this month.

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices rebounded moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 126.87 yen, 0.27 yen higher than Monday's
close of 126.60 yen. Opening at 127.08 yen, the currency moved
slightly lower while ranging mainly betweeen 126.77 yen and 127.20
yen.
   The dollar-yen rate moved little because there was no news to
stimulate it, said a dealer with Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.
   The dollar rose in early trading but ``it fell back as the
market players started selling the currency when it moved up into
the 127-yen level,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 57.03 points
Monday, regained 139.95 points, or 0.51 percent, to close at
27,421.49. The index gained 10.48 points shortly after the market
opened and continued upward.
   Trading was active with volume on the first section estimated at
1.2 billion shares. Steels, gas and real estate stocks attracted
traders.
   Despite prospects for lower interest rates and declining oil
prices, negative factors including Emperor Hirohito's monthlong
illness have kept share prices from rising dramatically.

   The dollar rose against all major currencies in
early European trading today. Gold prices also were higher.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's rise was mostly a reaction to
its fall last week and also followed renewed signals from the Bank
of Japan that it is ready to buy dollars if the currency declines
further.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar edged up 0.27 yen to a closing 126.87 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 127.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7965 West German marks, up from 1.7860; 1.5235
Swiss francs, up from 1.5145; 6.1350 French francs, up from 6.1025;
2.0235 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0143; 1,338.35 Italian lire, up
from 1,330.85; and 1.2002 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1973.
   In London, the dollar also rose against the British pound, which
cost $1.7485 in early trading, cheaper than $1.7520 late Monday.
   Gold rose after falling several dollars on Monday, hurt by the
failure of eight key members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to agree on production restrictions.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $406 a troy ounce, up
from $405.15 bid late Monday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $406.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $406.40, up from $405.50 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 32 cents to close at a bid
$408.52.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.21 a troy
ounce, down from late Monday's $6.23.

   Maxxam Group Inc., the winning bidder for
KaiserTech Ltd., has agreed to pay $13 million to the company it
defeated, Wesray Capital Corp., a published report said today.
   Wesray, a New Jersey partnership that had joined with
KaiserTech's top officers in the failed bid, will receive the
payment for helping Maxxam secure bank financing related to the
acquisition, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
   Shareholders will vote on Maxxam's acquisition of KaiserTech
Thursday at the annual meeting that will be run by KaiserTech chief
executive James Pasman and Charles Hurwitz, the Texas financier who
controls New York-based Maxxam.
   The two men will be in New York Friday for the newly acquired
company's first board meeting.
   Analysts believe Maxxam, in its payment to Wesray, wishes to
placate Pasman and Kaiser President Stephen Hutchraft, who were
part of the Wesray bid, the Chronicle reported. Both will continue
to be in charge after the acquisition.
   KaiserTech is the nation's third-largest aluminum producer,
while Maxxam is involved in real estate and lumber.

<HEAD>Frank Perdue Takes Soviet Ambassador on Poultry Tour</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS graf 3 to delete extraneous word</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ACCOMAC, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin met
poultry magnate Frank Perdue and walked away with two ``Oven
Stuffer Roasters'' and some insight into chicken processing.
   Dubinin on Monday took a daylong tour of Perdue Farms on the
Eastern Shore to get a firsthand look at the mechanics of poultry
processing.
   As chairman and chief owner of Perdue Farms, Dubinin's
68-year-old host oversees a chicken empire that's expected to gross
more than $1 billion in sales this year. Perdue's face is familiar
on television where he appears in his own commercials.
   ``It's something that's very well developed in the United States
and with Perdue especially,'' Dubinin said of American poultry
production. ``The problem in the Soviet Union is output quality and
quantity.''
   Perdue accompanied the ambassador and his entourage of eight
including Dubinin's wife, Liana, and two daughters through a
hatchery in Westover, and a processing plant in Accomac that
employs 1,700 people and slaughters an average 300,000 chickens a
day.
   Afterward, he presented the diplomat with an ice chest bearing
the Perdue logo that contained the two roasting chickens. The rest
of the Soviet delegation from Washington received similar freebies.
   Dubinin said the visit was his first contact with chicken
processing in any country. He called his trip a demonstration that
``diplomacy is not just politics, it's economic relations ...
technological relations.''
   The ambassador said the Soviet Union would like to increase
chicken production. Watching eviscerated poultry moving swiftly
through the production line, is ``an interesting experience for
me,'' he told reporters.
   As for Perdue's television commercials, Dubinin said he has seen
them and found them amusing. But he added that he is less concerned
with the marketing aspects of poultry production and more concerned
about output.
   Dubinin said there is potential for some joint enterprise with
Perdue and the Soviet Union, but ``we will have a better idea''
about that after Perdue makes a planned visit to the Soviet Union.
   Perdue spokeswoman Chris Whaley confirmed that Perdue is
scheduled to make a visit soon, but she declined to speculate on
what business dealings might be under discussion.

   A former tax shelter promoter who is in federal
prison has been sentenced to seven to 21 years in state prison
after pleading guilty to charges of bilking investors of more than
$150 million.
   John Peter Galanis, 45, of Greenwich, Conn., pleaded guilty
Friday to four larceny counts of a 105-count Manhattan grand jury
indictment. He admitted that, from February 1984 through June 1986,
he and nine others defrauded investors through a real estate
venture.
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Galanis and
his co-conspirators set up Consolidated Mortgage Co. and sold $75
million worth of partnerships with a promise of tax writeoffs that
later proved unlawful.
   In another case, Morgenthau said, the conspirators formed Nashua
Trust Co., a firm that supposedly would rehabilitate hotels and
commercial property in Atlantic City. More than 1,300 people
invested in the firm, which lost the properties and went bankrupt,
the district attorney said.
   Galanis was sentenced to up to 27 years in federal prison
following his conviction in White Plains last summer on
racketeering and other charges.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax ordered Galanis to
serve the state sentence concurrently with the federal time.

<HEAD>British, U.S. Actions Set Back Minorco Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government and a U.S. federal judge
have dealt damaging blows to Minorco SA's hostile bid for
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, citing concerns about monopolization
of the world gold market.
   In London today, the government said the takeover offer, which
values Gold Fields at roughly $5 billion, would be investigated by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for its possible adverse
effect on competition.
   The ruling blocks for up to three months the bid by the
Luxembourg-based investment arm of the South African gold and
diamond mining giants, Anglo American Corp. and De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Michael B. Mukasey in New York
issued a temporary injunction against the bid on antitrust grounds.
Gold Fields has contended that a takeover by Minorco would imperil
American access to gold and strategic minerals.
   Minorco offered $22.86 in cash and stock for each Consolidated
Gold Fields share it does not already own on condition the bid was
not referred to the British monopolies commission.
   Minorco has lifted its stake in Consolidated Gold Fields to
about 29.6 percent.
   Minorco issued a statement saying it was considering its
position in the light of the British government's decision.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young asked the monopolies commission to
report to him within the three months.
   The British investigation will center on the proposed takeover's
impact on strategic metals, in particular titanium and zircon, a
spokesman at the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   Titanium, a metal largely used as a whitener in paints, also is
used in jet engines, a Consolidated Gold Fields metallurgist said.
Zircon is mainly used as a refracting agent in glass and steel
furnaces, but is also a critical substance in nuclear submarines
and power plants, and in rocket nose cones, he said.
   Consolidated Gold Fields says that Australian-based Renison
Goldfields Consolidated Ltd., in which it has a 49 percent stake,
is the world's largest producer of mineral sands that serve as raw
materials for titanium and zircon.
   Consolidated Gold Fields' shares plummeted on news of the
investigation, while Minorco's shares rose.

<HEAD>Drained Fruehauf Moves To Restructure Slumping Trailer Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially drained Fruehauf Corp. is
restructuring its slumping trailer operations, a move that will
necessitate an unspecified number of layoffs and early retirements
at its headquarters here, the company announced.
   The truck-trailer and auto-parts maker began layoffs last week
in its engineering department, Fruehauf spokesman David Hladik said
Monday.
   About 40 percent of the department's 78 engineers received pink
slips, and others will be transferred, he added.
   ``There will be some layoffs in personnel and an early
retirement program has been implemented,'' Hladik said.
   Low profit margins and hot competition have depressed Fruehauf's
trailer division, which lost $29 million in 1986 and broke even
last year.
   The company has been struggling since a management-led leveraged
buyout in 1986 left it saddled with debt. Fruehauf has sold a
number of operations and trimmed its long-term debt to $705
million, down from $1.6 billion in 1986.
   Last week, the company in part blamed that debt for
third-quarter losses of $19.1 million. That compares to a loss of
$14.3 million or $1.77 per share in the third quarter of 1987.
   The company is discussing a possible merger with farm and
industrial machinery manufacturer Varity Corp. of Toronto.

<HEAD>Locked-out IP Workers Go To The Polls Friday To Vote On Compromise
Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Locked-out union workers go to the polls
Friday to decide whether to accept a compromise offer aimed at
breaking their 1{-year-old labor dispute with International Paper
Co.
   The offer covers a six-year period retroactive to Feb. 1, 1987.
The previous contract expired in January 1987 and union workers
were locked out of the plant on March 21, 1987.
   Don Langham, regional vice president of the United Paperworkers
International Union, said the proposed contract ``provides
tremendous shift differential improvement and it provides that all
union members would be returned to work immediately.''
   One of the major issues in the labor dispute has been IP's
policy of paying production employees extra when they work Sundays
and holidays. The company wanted to eliminate the bonuses to cut
costs.
   Frank Bragg, president of UPIU Local 265 and a member of the
committee that has represented the 1,200 locked-out workers at the
bargaining table, said the company would not address the bonus
issue.
   Bragg said the union membership appears to be ``split at this
point as to who wants to fight and who wants to quit.''
   ``We commend our people for fighting the battle as long as they
have,'' he said. ``But at some point in time, we had to go back to
the members for direction on which way they want us to go.''
   Company officials have said the locked-out workers cannot return
to their jobs until they accept a new labor agreement. The Mobile
mill has been operated by temporary workers since the start of the
lockout, which spread to strikes at IP mills in three other states.
   Those strikes have all been called off.

<HEAD>Xerox Earnings Up 9 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp.'s third-quarter earnings rose
9 percent to $146 million, with a strong showing from the company's
financial services division, the company said Tuesday.
   Net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was up from $134
million in the comparable period last year. Per-share earnings were
up 12 percent to $1.37 from $1.23.
   Revenues in the third quarter rose 10 percent to $4.1 billion
from $3.8 billion last year, Xerox reported.
   ``Financial services continued to contribute to our earnings
growth, and business products and systems again reflected the
strong momentum shown in international operations all year,'' said
Xerox Chairman David T. Kearns.
   Net income for the first nine months of 1988 was $465 million,
an increase of 10 percent from $423 million in 1987. Earnings per
share were $4.33, an 11 percent increase from $3.92 in the previous
year. Nine-month revenues were $12 billion, up 10 percent from $11
billion last year.
   Xerox Financial Services Inc. contributed $78 million in
third-quarter net income, after allocated interest costs, a 13
percent gain from $69 million a year ago. In the nine-month period,
financial services contributed $246 million to Xerox income, also
up 13 percent from $218 million in the previous year's period.
   ``Our year-to-date earnings growth reflects gains in Crum and
Forster Inc.'s property and casualty and life insurance operations,
excellent growth at Xerox Credit Corp. and good performance in our
investment banking activities,'' said Melvin Howard, chairman of
Xerox Financial Services.
   Business products and systems contributed $68 million in
third-quarter earnings, up 5 percent from $65 million in the
year-ago period. Nine-month income was $219 million, up 7 percent
from $205 million a year ago.
   Xerox President Paul A. Allaire said the company continues to
experience good growth in copier-duplicator and printing products,
particularly in international operations.
   He said the new Xerox 50 Series copiers and duplicators are
being well received and will become available worldwide by the
first quarter of 1989, contributing significantly to 1989 earnings.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices were narrowly mixed in light, nervous
trading Tuesday.
   With few major incentives for trading, players largely were
hanging back awaiting Thursday's release of British trade figures
for September.
   ``There is a lot of nervousness over the pound, interest rates
and the trade figures,'' said one dealer about the day's light
level of trading activity.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was unchanged
at 1,848.4 at midday.
   Volume was thin, with just 214.9 million shares changing hands,
compared with 289.5 million shares at the same time Monday.
   The major market-affecting news was a keenly awaited decision by
the British government to refer Minorco SA's 2.9 billion-pound, or
$5.06 billion, bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to investigate its possible
impact on competition.
   The decision blocked the bid from proceeding and Consolidated
Gold Fields' shares plummeted on the news, which also depressed the
overall market. Consolidated Gold Fields shares fell 104 pence to
11.41 pounds.

   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting positive technical
and fundamental signals following three days of losses in most of
the grain pits.
   The wheat market, which had rallied late Monday on news of
Chinese buying interest, continued to climb this morning on a
report that China had purchased 40,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices overnight, analysts said.
   Corn futures got a boost from an Agriculture Department report
issued Monday afternoon that showed last week's corn exports to be
much larger than expected.
   And the Census Bureau's weekly soybean crush report showed the
amount of U.S. soybean meal stocks to be much lower than expected,
which was positive for soybean prices, analysts said.
   ``Of course, all the news wasn't friendly,'' said Victor

<TEXT>
   Scarlett O'Hara's hometown is for sale, and
cash-rich Japanese investors are the principal targets of
businessmen marketing Atlanta's highest profile office buildings.
   It is a poorly kept secret that a Japanese insurance company is
about to buy the IBM Tower, paying $300 million for Atlanta's
year-old showpiece skyscraper.
   And market professionals say other buildings, principally the
headquarters tower of Georgia-Pacific Corp., and CNN Center, hub
for Ted Turner's broadcasting conglomerate, are on the block and
may soon be sold to syndicates made up largely of foreign investors.
   The Asian invasion of the American real estate market has raised
hackles elsewhere in the United States, as major landmarks like the
Exxon Corp. building in New York City have been snapped up by the
Japanese. But here in Atlanta, the phenomenon follows years of
active campaigning for foreign investment.
   Georgia has been mining Japan for business since the mid-70s and
the state now ranks second to California in Japanese manufacturing
investment. Atlanta ranks third among American cities behind Dallas
and Houston in the number of Asian-owned businesses per 1,000 Asian
residents.
   ``Jobs. Jobs is the purpose of our efforts,'' said Randy
Cardoza, deputy commissioner of the Georgia Department of Industry
and Trade.
   A decade of self-promotion and airport improvements by the city
and state have helped fuel the drive for foreign investment, said
Allen Judd, a business consultant who was one of the founders eight
years ago of the Japan-America Society of Georgia, Inc.
   A survey on Atlanta real estate by the Braemar Group Ltd. says
12.06 percent of the city's office space is foreign-owned, and
Braemar Group owner and managing partner Tarby Bryant predicts 50
percent of the best office space will be foreign-owned by the year
2000, with the Japanese accounting for half.
   ``With all of the major Japanese banks currently in Atlanta and
two airlines, JAL (Japan Airlines) and Delta (Air Lines), now
flying direct links to Japan's Narita Airport, I am confident that
we will see more Japanese investors looking at our office
buildings, hotels and regional malls for acquisition,'' he said.
   Atlanta ``is at the top of the second tier'' of cities drawing
Japanese interest, Bryant said, because its so-called ``trophy
properties'' are available at cheaper rates than in the
``first-tier'' cities of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and
Washington, D.C.
   There also is less competition in cities such as Atlanta to
purchase trophy properties _ defined loosely by Bryant as ``quality
real estate, architecturally significant with a major tenant.''
   The pending purchase of the IBM Tower by Sumitomo Life Insurance
Co. ``is the big foot in our pond,'' Bryant said, and more such
deals should follow fairly soon.
   Such deals have been aided by the recent strength of the
Japanese yen over the dollar and by Atlanta's expected strong
growth in the next several years. The combination makes real estate
investments particularly attractive.
   Among foreign investors, the Japanese have the most money and
are the most aggressive, Bryant said. In addition, he said, the
Japanese feel pressure from their peers to invest in America.
   The Consulate General of Japan in Atlanta says there were 236
Japanese-owned facilities in the state as of July 1, employing
12,100 people and representing an investment of $810 million.
   A report last year by the Georgia Department of Industry and
Trade said there were six Taiwanese-owned facilities and four owned
by Koreans. Two investors were from Singapore and one from Hong
Kong.
   Of those Asian-owned businesses, 38 are headquarters for U.S
subsidiaries, including Hitachi America Ltd., which makes
telecommunications equipment; Asahi Inc., athletic shoe
manufacturer; Mizuno Golf Co., a division of Japan's largest
sporting goods company; and TDK Manufacturing (US) Ltd. Co.,
manufacturer of video cassette tapes.
   There are numerous regional headquarters, and manufacturing
plants for some of the best-known Japanese products, including
Maxell tapes, Sony records, Mitsubishi televisions and Kubota
tractors.
   There are also nine Japanese banks, and Judd said a 10th is
expected to open soon.
   In all, there were 1,057 foreign-owned facilities in the state
last year, the Industry and Trade report said. The department said
Japanese capital investment ranked second in the state behind
Canada.
   Just last week, the Yamaha Motor Co. opened its Yamaha USA golf
car factory at Newnan, Ga., its first North American manufacturing
facility.
   Some of that investment may have been driven by fears the
Congress would enact severely protectionist trade legislation.
Despite passage of a watered-down trade bill, Bryant said he
doesn't expect the flood of foreign investment to slow anytime soon.

   When Joon H. Song moved to Atlanta 26 years ago,
there were three Korean families in town.
   ``Then my brother came, and my sister, my father,'' Song said.
Other families followed, and now, Song estimates, there are between
15,000 and 20,000 Koreans living in the metropolitan area of 2.5
million people.
   There are also an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Chinese and about
5,000 Japanese, according to Allen Judd, an independent business
consultant who has spent much of the past two decades promoting
Asian business connections in Atlanta.
   A recent study disclosed that many of those Asian-Americans own
their own businesses _ so many that Atlanta ranked third in the
country behind Dallas and Houston in the number of Asian-owned
businesses per 1,000 Asian residents.
   The study said there are 80.5 Asian-owned businesses per 1,000
Asian-Americans in Atlanta. Dallas was first with 90.3, followed by
Houston at 84.9. Places with large Asian populations such as
Honolulu and San Francisco were far down the list.
   The finding surprised Song, a past president of the Korean
Association, an umbrella organization of 72 Korean support groups
in the Atlanta metropolitan area.
   ``Just like the Irish went to Boston (and) the Polish went to
Chicago, Koreans and Chinese came to Atlanta,'' said Judd, a
founder of the Japan-America Society of Georgia Inc.
   Song estimates that about 70 percent of Atlanta's Asians are
direct immigrants with the rest coming from other major American
cities.
   They are drawn, he said, by the same factors that have made
Atlanta and the rest of the Sunbelt some of the fastest growing
areas in the country.
   ``Weather's good. Transportation's good. Lots of things (are)
good,'' said Song, who works for Citizens & Southern National Bank
in Oriental business development.
   The new arrivals also find a strong sense of community, 42
Korean churches, a Korean-American school and a Korean chamber of
commerce.
   ``Most of the Korean business is family business, that's why the
business is growing very fast,'' Song said.
   The exact Asian population of the Atlanta is hard to judge, with
the latest figures coming from the 1980 U.S. Census and most
experts agreeing the numbers have changed substantially since then.

<HEAD>Borden Third-Quarter Earnings Up 16.4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. said Tuesday its third-quarter
earnings rose 16.4 percent as its sales picked up 11.6 percent from
the same period a year earlier.
   The food, consumer products and chemical company said it earned
$91.9 million, or $1.24 a share, during the quarter ended Sept. 30,
up from $79 million, or $1.07 a share, in third-quarter 1987.
   Sales for the latest period totaled $1.87 billion, up from $1.68
billion.
   Borden said disappointing results in its dairy division were
more than offset by gains in the company's grocery, snacks and
chemicals units.
   For the first nine months of the year, Borden reported earnings
of $218 million, or $2.95 per share, up 17.1 percent from $185.7
million, or $2.52 a share, a year earlier.
   Sales for the first three quarters rose to $5.26 billion from
$4.71 billion.

   The stock market was little changed today as
prices withstood profit-taking and takeover speculation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off .18 at 2,170.16
at midafternoon.
   Losers narrowly outpaced gainers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 640 up, 730
down and 521 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 110.76 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Traders were encouraged that the market did not lose ground as it
consolidated in the face of a two-month-old rally. ``The
profit-taking has been well contained,'' one trader said.
   The market, however, has divided into two unequal segments _ one
that involves takeover and buyout issues and another that involves
the remaining equities untouched by real bids or speculation.
   Billion-dollar bids have been made recently for such big-name
companies as RJR Nabisco, Pillsbury, Kraft, West Point-Pepperell and
Chicago Pacific. Large bids tend to put the spotlight on the
industries of target companies, fueling further speculation about a
target company's peers as potential takeover candidates.
   ``Takeover speculation has reached a new extreme,'' said Alfred
E. Goldman, a vice president at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ``The crescendo keeps getting louder and louder.''
   The rest of the market, however, is not awash with excitement.
Analysts said the broad market appears tired and unable to mount a
sustainable advance.
   A government report showing a 4.1 percent drop in durable goods
orders in September was within market expectations. The report,
which hinted that inflation is being held in check, coupled with
stability in the bond and currency markets helped support stock
prices, said Emmanuel Geronimous, a senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Among Big Board takeover issues, Nabisco was up } at 84}; Kraft

<HEAD>USX Profit Up 63 Percent, Weirton Posts Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil and steel giant USX Corp. reported on Tuesday a 63
percent increase in its third-quarter profit and boosted its
quarterly dividend by 17 percent.
   ``Given our strong cash position and our confidence in the
sustainability of our profit, we are pleased to increase the return
to our shareholders,'' Chairman David M. Roderick said.
   Meanwhile, employee-owned Weirton Steel Corp. said its
third-quarter earnings edged up slightly from a year ago, its 19th
consecutive profitable quarter since employees bought the mill from
National Intergroup Inc.
   USX, the Pittsburgh-based parent of Marathon Oil and the nation's
largest steel producer, reported its quarterly profit rose to $228
million, or 80 cents per share, from $140 million, or 46 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter sales rose 7.7 percent to $4.2 billion from $3.9
billion.
   The latest quarter included $71 million gain from the settlement
of a federal tax issue and a pre-tax credit of $61 million from
asset sales. The 1987 third quarter benefited from a $47 million
credit on restructuring charges and a pre-tax credit of $22 million
from asset sales.
   The company boosted its dividend to 35 cents per share from 30
cents, payable Dec. 10 to stockholders of record at the end of
business Nov. 4.
   USX earned $598 million, or $2.07 per share, on sales of $12.4
billion in the first nine months of the year. USX earned $233
million, or 67 cents per share, on sales of $10.6 billion in the
1987 period.
   Marathon reported quarterly operating income of $183 million on
sales of $2.3 billion thanks to better margins on refined profits.
   ``Marathon is positioned to make a meaningful contribution to
corporate results, even in a market characterized by low and
volatile worldwide crude oil prices,'' Roderick said.
   The steelmaking USS division reported quarterly operating income
of $95 million on sales of $1.4 billion in the second year of the
steel industry's recovery from a seven-year slump.
   In Weirton, W.Va., Weirton Steel said it earned a record $34
million in the latest quarter, up from $33.6 million a year earlier.
   The company is owned by its 8,000-some employees and not public
stockholders, and as a result does not report earnings per share. It
said $17 million of its latest profit will be distributed to
employees, however, up from $11 million a year earlier.
   The company said its sales for July to September rose to $341
million on shipments totaling 671,000 tons, compared with $330
million on shipments totaling 708,000 tons a year earlier.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company's earned
$117.9 million on sales of $1.05 billion, compared with $97.3
million on sales of $997 million a year earlier.

<HEAD>Sears Profit Down 16 Percent in 3rd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said Tuesday its
third-quarter net income fell 16 percent, marking the third
consecutive quarter of declining profits for the nation's largest
retailer.
   Sears blamed the drop on flat merchandise sales and intense
competition from other retailers.
   The company said its net income totaled $344.2 million, or 90
cents per share, for the three months ending Sept. 30, compared with
$409 million, or $1.08 per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Revenue for the 1988 third quarter rose 9.5 percent to $13.35
billion, compared with $12.19 billion last year.
   Sears' second-quarter net income was 5 percent below the
year-earlier results, and its first-quarter profit was off by 37
percent.
   For the first three quarters combined, Sears' net income was 18
percent below its net for the first nine months of 1987.
   Sears has been struggling to improve its performance, which has
been poor in comparison to other large retailers, and the company
has been rumored to be considering selling some of its assets.
   The Sears Merchandise Group, with responsibility for the
company's store operations, reported third-quarter income of $135.4
million, compared with $170.4 million a year ago. Sears said the
group's results were adversely affected by flat sales, intense
competition, pressure on gross margins and inventory adjustments.
   The merchandise group's results included a $26 million income-tax
benefit resulting from a bookkeeping change.
   The Dean Witter Financial Services Group reported third-quarter
income of $20.6 million compared with a loss of $4.2 million last
year. The group includes Discover Card, Sears' all-purpose credit
card, which showed a profit for the third consecutive quarter after
two years of losses.
   Discover Card reported income of $13.6 million compared with a
loss of $29.4 million last year.
   The Allstate Insurance Group had third-quarter income of $217
million, down from $240.5 million last year. Sears said the decline
was due to lower underwriting results, reduced tax benefits and
lower capital gains.
   The Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group reported third-quarter
income of $25.8 million, compared with $47.8 million a year ago.
Income in both quarters included the sale of shopping centers, Sears
said, with the timing of the 1987 sales accounting for the larger
income last year.
   For the nine months ending Sept. 30, Sears had net income of
$893.1 million, or $2.35 per share, on sales of $38.49 billion
compared with net income of $1.09 billion, or $2.86 per share, on
sales of $34.39 billion in the first nine months of 1987.

<HEAD>Goodyear Reports Earnings Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. on Tuesday said its
third-quarter profits fell 65 percent from a year ago partly because
of difficult business conditions in its domestic tire operations.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Goodyear earned $63.5 million, or
$1.11 a share. A year earlier, the company reported net income of
$178.7 million, or $3.13 a share. In the year-ago period, Goodyear
benefited from a $50 million gain on the sale of properties in
Arizona.
   Sales, however, rose 8 percent to $2.7 billion, from $2.5 billion
a year ago.
   Goodyear attributed the recent decline in profits partly to
higher natural rubber costs in its domestic tire operations. Plant
efficiencies also were reduced due to an unusually hot summer, when
the company was forced to cut back on electricity at some plants.
   Goodyear began a major cost-cutting effort and shed most of its
non-rubber operations beginning in late 1986 to raise cash and fend
off a hostile takeover attempt by financier Sir James Goldsmith.
   Chairman Robert E. Mercer said the company experienced a lag in
recovering costs through price increases. Tire unit sales in the
U.S. replacement market were down in the three months, although the
decline was partially offset by better unit sales of lower priced
tires to original equipment manufacturers.
   The company indicated its businesses in 27 foreign countries
showed improved earnings, but they were partially offset by greater
foreign currency lossses.
   Through the nine months, Goodyear earned fell 51 percent to
$293.7 million, or $5.13 a share, on sales of $8.1 billion. In the
year-ago period, earnings were $603.9 million, or $9.78 a share, on
sales of $7.4 billion.

   Wheat futures closed sharply lower Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in a late, technically motivated sell-off
that spread from the wheat pit to the other grain and soybean
markets.
   Corn and soybeans finished moderately lower; oat prices closed
down sharply.
   Tuesday marked the fourth straight day of declining wheat prices
and the sixth session in the last eight in which wheat values have
dropped.
   Large brokerage firms including Refco Inc., Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. and Thomson McKinnon Inc. each sold more than 1 million
bushels of wheat late in the session after the price for December
delivery tumbled past $4.12\ a bushel, Monday's session low,
analysts said.
   Prices had opened higher on reports that China had purchased
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, but prices gradually slipped with
the bears gaining the upper hand around midday.
   ``We started a little better but the bulls couldn't consolidate
it, then the bears started to consolidate it and pushed it down,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 11} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.07 a bushel; corn was 3
cents to 5 cents lower with December at $2.74{ a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 8\ cents lower with December at $2.36{ a bushel; soybeans
were 4{ cents lower to { cent higher with November at $7.61 a bushel.

<HEAD>Control Data Reports First Loss After Four Profitable Quarters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. of Minneapolis on Tuesday blamed market
``softness'' in key business sectors for causing the computer
company to post a net loss in the third quarter, its first loss
after four profitable quarters.
   Another computer company, Storage Technology Corp., said its
profit fell 76 percent in the latest quarter.
   Data-storage devices for mainframe computers are Storage
Technology's principal business and make up about one-third of the
revenue of Control Data.
   Control Data said it had a net loss of $2.4 million on revenues
of $841.4 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30.
   In the third quarter of 1987, Control Data had net earnings of
$6.8 million, or 16 cents per share, on revenues of $831.4 million.
   For the first nine months of 1988, Control Data reported net
earnings of $14.5 million, or 34 cents a share, on revenues of $2.7
billion, compared with earnings of $8.5 million, or 19 cents a
share, on revenues of $2.4 billion over the same period last year.
   ``We are disappointed that Control Data's 1988 results will come
in below mid-year expectations,'' said Robert M. Price, Control Data
chairman and chief executive officer. ``Nevertheless, the company's
recovery remains on track, and we continue to anticipate that
Control Data's operating performance in 1988 will be stronger than
it was in 1987.''
   Control Data's computer systems and services division has
received expected revenues later than anticipated, a trend that is
expected to continue into the fourth quarter, according to company
spokeswoman Nancy Foltz.
   Control Data said its results were helped by applying tax
benefits in the quarter worth $4.8 million.
   Third-quarter results also benefited from the sale of Control
Data's interest in Commercial Credit Corp.
   Imprimis Technology Inc., the company's disk drive subsidiary,
exceeded its third quarter 1987 performance and 1988 plan, even
though results for the period just ended were below those reported
in the first and second quarters of 1988, Control Data said.
   Storage Technology, of Lousville, Colo., which emerged from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection last year, said its profit
fell to $752,000, or less than 1 cent a share, from $3.2 million, or
1 cent a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $128.3 million from
$107 million.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Storage Technology
said its profit fell to $15.7 million, or 7 cents a share, from
$20.4 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to
$372.9 million from $301 million.

<HEAD>Staggering Debt Loads in Takeover Craze Could Severely Affect
Workforce</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The intensifying pace of multibillion-dollar
takeovers and restructurings that rely mainly on borrowed money
could severely reshape the U.S. job market and leave thousands of
people unemployed, labor economists and consultants said Tuesday.
   They argue that the staggering amounts of debt acquired by many
companies as a result of these transactions, called leveraged
buyouts or LBOs, will have to be repaid somehow, even if it means
selling profitable assets, cutting payrolls and reducing benefits
such as health-care insurance.
   Some LBO critics argue that the impact would multiply if the
nation plunges into a recession, forcing these highly indebted
companies to cut more deeply into the core of their businesses in
order to meet debt payments.
   These warnings come at a time that many U.S. companies are
aggressively cutting costs to survive in an increasingly competitive
world economy and may not be able to afford added debt burdens.
   ``There is a casino society atmosphere in this country, because
shareholders want to make a killing,'' said Henry Schechter, an
AFL-CIO economist in Washington. ``The end result is billions of
debt. We've already had cases in which thousands of jobs are lost.''
   As examples, he said, the $4.2 billion LBO of Safeway Stores Inc.
left thousands of workers unemployed in Texas because property there
was sold to pay off debt. A Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. restructuring
to thwart a hostile takeover, which saddled the company with $3.6
billion in debt, led the company to close factories and lay off
hundreds of employees.
   The frenzy of company restructurings that have altered the U.S.
economic landscape this decade already had raised some of these
issues. Many that have restructured into privately-held companies
emerge as stronger because management is more focused on their core
businesses and faces fewer pressures for short-term profit.
   Retailer R.H. Macy & Co., for example, which went private in a
$3.6 billion LBO in 1985, is regarded as one of the best-managed
chains in the industry. Seven-Up Co., which languished under
conglomerate owner Philip Morris Cos., increased productivity and
trimmed waste after it was sold in an LBO two years ago.
   But the speed and size of deals announced just in the past few
weeks, notably a proposed $20 billion LBO of RJR Nabisco Inc., have
raised fears of upheavals in the workforce that had not been widely
envisioned before.
   ``I don't think this is good, frankly,'' said Edith Weiner, a
partner in Weiner, Edrich Brown Inc., a New York-based business
consulting firm that focuses on long-range trends.
   ``If one company does this to restructure and solve problems of
non-productivity, that's one thing, but the evidence is that's not
the case anymore,'' she said. ``It's gotten to the point where we're
not talking about the long-term interests of the economy at all.''
   Rising concern about the impact of LBOs also coincides with a
labor force increasingly comprised of working couples, who want more
job-related benefits for themselves and their children.
   Some economists say these are colliding trends that already have
caused management-labor conflicts and signal a declining standard of
living for a broad spectrum of American wage-earners.
   ``The shift from equity to debt financing is having a major
impact on workforces,'' said Richard Belous, a senior economist at
the National Planning Association, a Washington-based research
concern.
   ``You have to pay debt. If you have a balance sheet which is
highly leveraged, you've lost financial flexibility,'' he said.
``How do you regain it? You march into head of human resources and
regain flexibility that way.''
   For example, he said, many companies are relying increasingly on
part-time, temporary workers who receive less pay and little or no
benefits. The relatively slow growth of wages in the past few years
is a partial reflection of this trend, he said.
   Richard Miners, partner and chief operating officer at Goodrich &
Sherwood, a human resources consulting firm in New York, said many
LBO companies cannot afford to give generous benefits-wage packages.
   ``They may offer insurance but employees must contribute,'' he
said. ``When it comes time to give raises, they'll give less than
the norm. They'll eliminate a lot of jobs to fine tune the machine
they have.''
   Although some companies will benefit with increased productivity,
he said, longer-term consequences are unclear. Many employees could
grow bitter and disloyal, resulting in declining productivity.
   ``Some of these companies, all they care about is the service of
the debt,'' Miners said. ``The pride factor workers may have had in
the past could disappear.''

   The dollar finished mixed against major foreign
currencies Tuesday, weighed down by a government report of a
slowdown in U.S. factory orders.
   The dollar edged down against the British pound and the Japanese
yen, but rose against the currencies of most other major U.S.
trading partners.
   The Commerce Department said orders for ``big-ticket'' durable
goods plunged an unexpected 4.1 percent in September.
   Currency traders took the decline as a sign that the U.S. economy
could be slowing down, something that would tend to decrease demand
for dollars by foreign investors.
   The factory orders report fit in with other signs of a slowdown
last month, including the second consecutive decline in retail sales
and a drop in manufacturing employment.
   The dollar's decline against the British pound was partly the
result of a speech by Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the
Exchequer, that supported sterling, according to Frank Conte, a vice
president of Barclays Bank PLC in New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar edged up 0.27 Japanese yen to a closing
126.87 yen. Later, in London, it rose to 127.75 yen. At the end of
the day in New York, the dollar fell to 126.80 yen from 127.02.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7535 to buy one pound, up from $1.7520 late Monday. In New York,
the pound rose to $1.7515 from $1.7501 Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7903 West German marks, up from 1.7898; 1.5183
Swiss francs, up from 1.5175; 1.2012 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1986; 6.1230 French francs, 6.1100; and 1,333.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,332.88.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7860 West German marks, unchanged; 1.5175 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5145; 6.1100 French francs, up from 6.1025; 2.0170
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0143; 1,332.00 Italian lire, up from
1,330.85; and 1.1990 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1973.
   Gold recovered some of its losses from Monday, when it had fallen
after eight key members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries failed to agree on production restrictions.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose 32 cents to close at a bid $408.52 a troy
ounce. Gold rose in London to $407.25 an ounce from $405.15 Monday.
In Zurich, it rose to $407 an ounce from $405.50.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at
$406.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $405.50 late Monday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for near-month
delivery rose to $406.40 an ounce from $405.80 Monday.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $6.25 a troy ounce
from $6.23 late Monday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
near-month delivery rose to $6.221 an ounce from $6.197.

<HEAD>USW Contract Major Obstacle, Wheeling-Pitt Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new contract with the United
Steelworkers union is one of the major obstacles as
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. prepares to present its
reorganization plan to federal bankruptcy court, company president
and chief executive officer William Scharffenberger said Tuesday.
   ``Negotiating an equitable labor agreement is the single most
important task still before us,'' Scharffenberger said during the
company's annual shareholders' meeting. ``The next contract we sign
with the United Steelworkers will, to a very large degree, determine
whether Wheeling-Pittsburgh can compete in the global steel economy
after we leave the shelter of bankruptcy.''
   He said contract negotiations with the USW must start soon, but
probably not until November. The union's current contract expires 10
days after the company's reorganization plan is approved by the
court, Scharffenberger said.
   But USW District 23 Director Jim Bowen said following the meeting
it would be foolish to start contract talks before the
reorganization plan is complete.
   Bowen said there's no sense ``wasting our time'' negotiating a
contract when all claims against the company haven't been settled.
He said it would be better to wait until the plan is filed and union
knows just how much money the company has available to pay its
workers.
   Scharffenberger, speaking at a news conference before the
shareholders' meeting, said talks about the company's pension
obligations are continuing with the USW and the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures pensions.
   When Wheeling-Pitt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
April 1985, it terminated its pension plan, and the federal pension
agency assumed responsibility for the benefits.
   Scharffenberger said the company also is negotiating with the
Internal Revenue Service, which has a $400 million claim against the
company stemming from the pension problems. He said the IRS has
offered to accept $18 million to settle the dispute, while the
company is offering $1.8 million.
   Scharffenberger said the USW shouldn't expect too much in its
contract talks.
   ``Our negotiations must be conducted in the light of what could
be called optimistic realism,'' he said.
   Wheeling-Pitt will try to negotiate a 15 percent work force
reduction over the next two years, mainly through attrition,
Scharffenberger said. The company has 6,400 employees, 5,200 of who
are covered by the USW contract.
   He said Wheeling-Pitt has about $414 million in cash on hand, but
most will go to creditors immediately after the reorganization plan
is confirmed.
   ``As terrible as bankruptcy is, and as expensive as it is ... it
gave us a marvelous opportunity to clean up the company,''
Scharffenberger said at the news conference. ``But I don't recommend
it.''

<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. on Tuesday
announced plans to buy back shares with a current market value of
more than $900 million, boosting its stock price as sketchy takeover
rumors swirled.
   Analysts said a takeover bid for the computer company seemed
quite unlikely and described the buyback as a step to take advantage
of the stock's bargain price while doing something to benefit its
shareholders.
   ``I don't think it's a defensive move by any means,'' said
Michael Pompian, an analyst in Boston for Needham & Co. of New York.
   Digital's stock rose $2 a share to $92 a share in consolidated
New York Stock Exchange trading, following a rise of $3 a share on
Monday.
   Digital, the world's second biggest computer company after
International Business Machines Corp., said its board of directors
had authorized management to buy back up to 10 million of its own
shares from time to time on the open market.
   That number of shares represents about 8 percent of the common
stock outstanding. They would be bought at whatever the prevailing
market price is at the time.
   The recent spate of takeover activity involving companies such as
Kraft Inc. and RJR Nabisco Inc. helped revive old rumors that
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. was interested in buying Digital.
Both companies have disparaged the rumors.
   ``Whoever would be buying DEC would need an awfully big
checkbook,'' said Barry Bosak, an analyst for Eberstadt Fleming Inc.
in New York.
   Digital's stock hit a peak of $199.50 in 1987, but has slumped
badly since then. The company has no dividend to support the stock,
so buybacks are one of the few ways to reward shareholders.
   ``We believe buying our stock is an attractive investment and a
sound way to build a shareholder value,'' James M. Osterhoff,
Digital's vice president for finance, said in a news release.
   Digital purchased 3 million shares of its stock for $363 million
in January and 5 million shares for $782 million in a program
completed in May 1987. Those shares were used for employee stock
plans.

   The stock market finished narrowly mixed Tuesday
as a feeding frenzy in takeover issues subsided.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 13 points Monday,
gained 3.02 to close at 2,173.36. The key index had seesawed within
a 2-point range for much of the session.
   Declining issues narrowly outpaced advancers in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 701 issues
up, 727 down and 525 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 155.19 million shares,
down from 170.59 million. Nationwide, consolidated volume in
NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on
the over-the-counter market, totaled 183.30 million shares.
   The market appeared steady throughout most of the session as
little fresh takeover news emerged. Philip Puccio, a senior vice
president at Dillon, Read & Co., noted that the market ``has kind of
dried up'' following a recent string of multibillion-dollar takeover
announcements involving companies with high-profile brand names.
   But while stocks that are the target of deals and takeover
speculation have basked in the spotlight, the broader market has
missed much of the enthusiasm.
   ``The broader market seems to have settled back into its
malaise,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany
Corp.
   ``People seem to have retreated to the sidelines until another
news event comes along,'' he said.
   On a more subtle level, some analysts are beginning to wonder
whether some skepticism is settling in among investors who are
concerned about the sheer size of the latest crop of deals. The
largest proposal to date is Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s $20.3
billion bid for RJR Nabisco.
   ``People are starting to question whether we can get the
financing done to get all these large mergers completed,'' Johnson
said. ``A substantial amount of financing has to be completed in a
very short time ... and there's a healthy skepticism creeping in.''
   While some traders were preoccupied with the release on Wednesday
of third-quarter gross national product figures, many predicted the
government's report would be a non-event. As Johnson noted, the
report looks back to the third quarter while the market is looking
ahead to the first quarter of 1989.
   Among Big Board takeover issues, Nabisco was up 1 at 85; Kraft
fell 3 to 99, Pillsbury was off [ at 59{, and West Point-Pepperell
was off 1~ at 48[.
   Elsewhere, Rorer rose 3] to 45] amid speculation that F.
Hoffman-LaRoche might launch a $60-a-share takeover bid. Hoffman
declined comment.
   Church's Fried Chicken was up ~ at 8[. The company received an
$8-a-share bid from Popeyes Fried Chicken.
   Cray Research plunged 9 to 59~ following the release of
lower-than-expected earnings for the third quarter.
   Digital Equipment rose 2 to 92. The company announced plans to
buy back shares with a current market value of more than $900
million. Analysts said the news gave a boost to other technology
issues.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $190 million.
   The NYSE index was at up .02 at 158.87.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index gained .18 to 325.66, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up .10 to 282.38.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index stood at
304.38, down .57. The NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market closed at 386.12, down 1.11.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were mixed in lackluster trading
Tuesday amid continued investor concern about an oversupply of
long-term government securities.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond declined 3-16 point,
or about $1.80 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which
moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest
rate trends, rose to 8.93 percent from 8.91 percent late Monday.
   Bond prices had weakened slightly last week as investors
anticipated a vote in Congress to remove the cap on 30-year Treasury
issues. On Monday, long-term bond prices declined further after
Congress voted to allow the U.S. Treasury to sell more long-term
bonds.
   The Treasury is expected to announce on Nov. 2 plans to issue
between $8.5 billion and $9 billion of 30-year bonds in its
quarterly financing.
   Analysts said Tuesday's continuing weakness was due to ongoing
investor concern in the absence of more significant economic data.
Bondholders fear that a big increase in the supply of the Treasury
bonds would depress their price.
   ``People are waiting to get more fundamental data of a more
significant nature like tomorrow's GNP report,'' said Elizabeth
Ginste Reiners, vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. The
Commerce Department is scheduled to release gross national product
figures for the third quarter on Wednesday.
   The market virtually ignored two economic reports on Tuesday
suggesting lower inflation and a further weakening of the economy,
analysts said.
   One report by the Commerce Department said factory orders for
durable goods fell 4.1 percent in September. A second report by the
National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes fell 2.2 percent last month.
   ``There was nothing surprising in either report,'' said Marshall
Front, an economist with the Chicago investment firm of Stein Roe &
Farnham. ``People don't pay much attention to durable goods because
they are so volatile from month to month. And higher interest rates
have dampened home sales as expected.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury issues, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged, intermediate maturities ranged from 1-32
point lower to 3-32 point higher and the 20-year issue slipped 1-32
point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, slipped 0.15 to 1,148.87.
   In corporate trading, industrials were up slightly. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.21 at 294.47.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, rose to 7.70
percent as the discount rose to 7.46 percent. Yields on six-month
bills was unchanged at 7.95 percent with the discount flat at 7.55
percent. Yields on one-year bills declined to 8.16 percent with the
discount down 1 basis point at 7.59 percent.
   The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury
bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below
the face value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8\ percent, down from 85-16
percent late Monday.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and
Biscuits said Tuesday it was launching a cash tender offer for
Church's Fried Chicken Inc. that values its fast-food chicken
restaurant rival at about $290 million.
   The deal would combine the second and third largest fast-food
chicken chains in the nation. The biggest is Kentucky Fried Chicken,
a unit of Pepsico Inc. of Purchase, N.Y.
   A. Copeland Enterprises Inc., based in New Orleans, said it was
offering $8 a share for each of Church's 36 million shares.
   Church's management, based in San Antonio, Texas, urged its
shareholders to defer tendering their shares until its board could
review the offer and make a recommendation.
   Analysts said the bidding could go higher. On the New York Stock
Exchange, Church's stock rose 87{ cents a share to $8.12{.
   Joseph Doyle, who follows the fast-food business for the
investment firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York, said
the offer is ``reasonable and fair in one sense.''
   ``However, in this day and age of takeovers, the first offer is
generally not the last from the original offeree,'' Doyle said.
``Generally, the company under siege will try to come up with a
higher alternative offer.''
   The offer, which is to expire at midnight Nov. 22, is conditioned
upon tender of enough shares to give Copeland two-thirds of Church's
shares on a fully-diluted basis and upon obtaining sufficient
financing.
   Copeland Enterprises said it already owns nearly 1.2 million
shares, or 3.2 percent, of Church's shares.
   ``We intend to pursue it on an amicable basis,'' said James
Flynn, Copeland's president.
   Alvin C. Copeland, Popeyes chairman and chief executive, said in
a statement, ``The combination of Popeyes' proven industry expertise
in generating high per store sales on the basis of a superior
quality menu and Church's loyal customer base in its core markets
will create a dynamic fast-food restaurant operation.''
   Church's board of directors said it will make a recommendation to
its stockholders by Nov. 7 whether they should accept the offer and
why.
   ``Church's requests that its stockholders defer making a decision
to accept or reject the offer until they have been advised of the
company's position,'' the company said in a statement.
   Church's is the second-largest purveyor of fast-food chicken in
the country behind No.1 Kentucky Fried Chicken. New Orleans-based
Popeyes, founded in 1972, is the third largest, said Sawyer-Miller
Group spokesman Gary Bivings.
   Church's has 1,478 outlets in 34 states and several foreign
countries, a company spokeswoman said. Popeyes has 705 stores in 36
states and Canada.
   The merger of the two cahains probably would not radically change
the the national fried chicken business, Doyle said.
   ``Big is not necessarily better,'' Doyle said. ``I don't think it
would make much of an impact on the Kentucky Fried Chicken chain. I
think Kentucky Fried Chicken is much stronger than the Church's and
Popeyes chains.''
   Copeland's Flynn said hisd company would keep the restaurants'
menus separate with the possibility of adding some new products at
Church's.
   ``We intend to maintain two systems, and Church's would remain a
San Antonio-based company,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Four of the nation's oil companies reported huge gains in their
third-quarter profits Tuesday as hefty demand in refining and
marketing segments offset declining crude oil prices.
   Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. each reported double-digit gains,
while profits at Texaco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. more than
doubled in the latest period.
   Meanwhile, Shell Oil Co., Sun Co. and Amerada Hess Corp. each
reported sharp declines in their net earnings due partly to
declining crude oil prices.
   The larger oil companies said earnings were both hurt and helped
by falling crude prices. Lower costs for the raw product contributed
to higher profit margins in refining and marketing operations but
eroded gains in exploration and production.
   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said his company's refining and
marketing segments turned in strong performances thanks to improved
margins stemming from tight refinery capacity and product
inventories.
   In addition, strong consumer demand boosted sales of gasoline and
lubricants. Mobil's chemical unit also reported a record quarter,
Murray said.
   However, those improvements were partially offset by a 26 percent
drop in crude prices and higher exploration costs, which lowered the
companies' profits from exploration and production.
   Analysts attribute most of this year's drop in crude prices to
the excess supply of oil on world markets arising from the failure
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrain its
production.
   For the latest quarter, New York-based Mobil had an after-tax
profit of $557 million, or $1.36 a share, up 69 percent from $330
million, or 80 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue
totaled $13.12 billion, down a fraction from $13.14 billion in the
year-ago period.
   For the first nine months, profits at the nation's second-largest
oil company rose 86 percent to $1.62 billion, or $3.95 a share,
compared with $874 million, or $2.13 a share, in the same period
last year. Revenue totaled $40.99 billion, up 10 percent from $37.12
billion in the year-earlier period.
   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company based in White
Plains, N.Y., reported a 121 percent rise in its third-quarter
profits, to $239 million, or 98 cents a share, from $108 million, or
44 cents a share, in the 1987 quarter. Sales totaled $8.69 billion,
down 3 percent from $8.96 billion last year.
   For the first nine months, Texaco's profits jumped 183 percent to
$1.01 billion, or $4.14 a share, compared with $355 million, or
$1.46 a share, for the same period in 1987. Revenue totaled $26.8
billion, up 3 percent from $26 billion in the 1987 period.
   Texaco Chairman James W. Kinnear said the company is beginning to
see benefits from its recent restructuring.
   San Francisco-based Chevron, the fourth-largest U.S. oil concern,
said its profits rose 41 percent to $420 million, or $1.23 a share,
in the third quarter, compared with $297 million, or 87 cents a
share, in the 1987 period. Chevron's revenue, meanwhile, dropped 6.4
percent in the latest quarter to $7.2 billion, from $7.7 billion
last year.
   For the year, Chevron's earnings jumped 57 percent to $1.6
billion, or $4.66 a share, from $1.01 billion, or $2.97 a share. Its
revenue rose to $22 billion, up 1.3 percent from $21.7 billion.
   Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., reported the strongest
quarterly profit gains _ nearly sixfold _ to $215 million, or 89
cents a share, from $31 million, or 11 cents a share. The company's
sales totaled $2.85 billion, up a fraction from $2.80 billion.
   Since January, Phillips' net surged to $515 million, or $2.17 a
share, from $2 million in the comparable 1987 period. It had revenue
of $8.5 billion, up 7.6 percent from $7.9 billion.
   Phillips' spokesman Jere Smith said a major streamlining, which
included the layoff of more than 1,500 workers, contributed to the
latest figures.
   Meanwhile, Shell, the sixth-largest U.S. oil company, said
sagging crude prices pulled its quarterly earnings down 16.2
percent. The company's net was $352 million on revenue of $5.4
billion, compared with $420 million in the 1987 quarter on sales of
$5.6 billion. The company does not report per-share figures.
   But for the first nine months, Houston-based Shell's net improved
134 percent to $1.9 billion, on revenue of $15.9 billion, compared
with a profit in the same period last year of $795 million, on
revenue of $15.3 billion.
   Lower crude prices also contributed to a 47 percent drop in Sun's
latest earnings, which declined 47 percent to $72 million, or 67 a
share, from $137 million, or $1.27 a share. Its revenue totaled
$2.46 billion, down 2.3 percent from $2.52 billion.
   Sun, headquartered in Radnor, Pa., reported a $69 million loss
for the first nine months, on revenue of $7.3 billion, compared with
a profit of $265 million in 1987, or $2.44 a share, on revenue of
$7.2 billion.
   New York-based Amerada Hess reported a 59 percent decline in its
quarterly net to $15.8 million, or 20 cents a share, from $38.6
million, or 45 cents a share. The company's revenue fell 17.5
percent to $925 million from $1.1 billion.
   In the first nine months, Amerada reported an 81 percent decline
in earnings to $57 million, or 71 cents a share, on revenue of $3.1
billion, from $309 million, or $3.66 a share, on revenue of $3.5
billion.

<HEAD>Delchamps Rejects A&P Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delchamps Inc. said Tuesday its board had
rejected a $224 million merger proposal from The Great Atlantic &
Pacific Tea Co. Inc., saying the offer was inadequate and that
combining the supermarket companies may raise antitrust questions.
   Delchamps spokesman Joel Swanson said the supermarket company's
nine-member board met Monday night and rejected the merger proposal
of $32 a share for Delchamps' 7 million shares, saying it was not in
the best interests of its shareholders.
   In over-the-counter trading, Delchamps fell $1.50 a share to
$23.75.
   A&P spokesman Michael Rourke of Montvale, N.J., was not
immediately available for comment Tuesday on the rejection.
   Delchamps attorney James H. McDonald Jr. said the board's
decision was based on a number of factors, including Delchamps
recent store expansion efforts and other programs which will enhance
the value of the company.
   He said the board's decision was also based upon the advice of
counsel that significant antitrust issues exist with respect to the
A&P merger proposal and the opinion of its financial advisor,
Goldman, Sachs & Co., that the $32 per share proposal is inadequate.
Both companies operate grocery stores.
   A&P began trying to buy Delchamps two years ago.
   A&P's chairman and chief executive, James Wood, had said in his
Oct. 20 letter proposing the merger that if the Delchamps board
rejected his final offer, A&P would have no alternative than to
withdraw its $32 a share merger proposal and its $30 per share
tender offer, valued at $210 million.
   A.F. Delchamps Jr., chairman of the Delchamps board and
president, stated, ``We would hope that Mr. Wood can be taken at his
word, since we agree with him that the dissension brought on by this
takeover fight is not in the best interest of our company or our
shareholders. We wish no ill will to Mr. Wood and A&P and look
forward to competing in the retail marketplace with A&P.''
   Delchamps has a federal court suit pending against A&P on the
antitrust allegations. A&P filed a countersuit.
   The board also reiterated its stand that the long-term best
interests of Delchamps stockholders would be better served by the
company remaining independent and pursuing its business plan than
merging.
   The board further noted that it had received significant
sentiment expressing support for the board's decision to remain
independent and not accept the A&P offer.
   A&P, based in Montvale, N.J., is 52 percent owned by the
Tengelmann Group of West Germany. A&P had sales of $9.6 billion in
1987 from its 1,170 stores in this country and Canada.
   Delchamps had sales of about $700 million last year and has 103
stores in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana, and six
liquor stores.

<HEAD>Polaroid Reports $50.4 Million Loss For Third Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. on Tuesday posted a $50.4
million loss for its third quarter, due to costs of a corporate
restructuring and expenses of thwarting a hostile takeover bid.
   Polaroid said the after-tax loss came on sales of $436.3 million,
compared with a profit of $24.4 million, or 39 cents a share, on
sales of $425.9 million in the same period of 1987.
   Polaroid said the loss includes a $97 million charge to cover
costs associated with the restructuring, which included elimination
of 1,300 workers under a voluntary severance plan, planned global
distribution of 35mm color film and a $300 million employee stock
ownership plan.
   Polaroid, which faces a hostile buyout bid from Disney
family-owned Shamrock Holdings Inc. of Burbank, Calif., also
attributed the decline for the quarter ending Oct. 2 to start-up
costs for its new Impulse camera line.
   Polaroid spokesman Sam Yanes said the company spent more than $5
million on legal fees in the Shamrock battle and the bulk of the
losses were due to the severance payments.
   ``Our third quarter net results reflect a variety of temporary
factors that we expect to be behind us after the fourth quarter,''
Polaroid President I. MacAllister Booth said in a statement.
   But the company also said it expects to charge another $50
million in the fourth quarter to cover remaining costs of the
restructuring, announced in July.
   For the first nine months of the year, Polaroid reported a net
loss of $15.1 million on sales of $1.33 billion, compared with
earnings of $76.3 million, or $1.23 a share, on sales of $1.25
billion in the year-earlier period.
   Booth predicted total savings from the restructuring of more than
$100 million next year. He also said strong introductory sales of
Impulse in Europe boosted international sales by 11 percent.
   ``The underlying soundness of our business, together with the
progress we have been making in implementing our comprehensive
strategic plan, give us confidence in our ability to dramatically
improve the company's profitability in 1989,'' he said.
   Shamrock last month made a hostile $42-a-share offer after
Polaroid rebuffed two unsolicited bids. The two companies are
battling in a Delaware court over the legality of the 10 million
share employee stock plan, which Shamrock claims was enacted to
block a takeover.
   Two Polaroid officials took the stand in the trial in Delaware
Chancery Court on Tuesday before Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger
delayed further hearings until Nov. 3.
   Polaroid stock closed at $37.50, down 50 cents in consolidated
New York Stock Exchange trading.

<HEAD>Posts 24 Percent Earnings Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kroger Co. said Tuesday that its
third-quarter earnings climbed 24.1 percent as sales rose 8.4
percent overall and results from its supermarkets in virtually every
major market were ahead of last year.
   The results were released as the nation's largest supermarket
operator was undertaking a $4.6 billion restructuring to fight off
takeover bids.
   The company said earnings rose to $56.2 million, or 65 cents a
share, in the third quarter from $45.3 million, or 54 cents a share,
a year earlier.
   Third-quarter sales increased to $5.58 billion from $5.15 billion
in 1987.
   Kroger management said the sales increase was in line with
projections the company made as part of its corporate restructuring
plan. The plan involves dividend payoffs to shareholders, sale of
some company assets including stores, and the previously-disclosed
dismissal of 300 headquarters employees.
   ``Sales vitality will be a critical measure of the company's
ability to generate sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations
after Kroger's special restructuring dividend is distributed, as
anticipated, to shareholders Friday,'' the company said in a
statement.
   For the year to date, Kroger's earnings increased 13 percent to
$153.5 million, or $1.81 per share, from $135.9 million, or $1.62
per share, before the effect of a change in accounting for income
taxes, the company said.
   Counting the change, the company's earnings fell 22.9 percent to
$153.5 million from $199.2 million a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales totaled $14.4 billion, an increase of 8.7
percent from $13.3 billion last year.
   Kroger's restructuring plan, which the company's board of
directors approved on Sept. 23, calls for payment to shareholders of
a special cash dividend of $40 per share, plus a debenture with an
estimated trading value of $8. Kroger management says the plan will
allow shareholders to retain their interests in what will be a
smaller, but still independent company.

<HEAD>Salomon's Profit More Than Doubles in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salomon Inc. reported Tuesday that its profit
more than doubled in the third quarter from a year earlier, boosted
partly by strong results from its oil operations.
   The financial services and commodity trading company said its net
income in the three months ended Sept. 30 jumped to $65 million, or
37 cents a share, from $27 million, or 18 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   The increased profit occurred despite a 17.3 percent decline in
third-quarter revenue to $1.29 billion from $1.56 billion.
   The company's Salomon Brothers financial subsidiary earned $86
million before taxes in the quarter, up from $49 million a year
earlier.
   Salomon said its Phibro Energy unit had pretax earnings of $45
million, triple the year before. It attributed the growth to strong
profits from oil refining and trading, high demand for gasoline, and
savings resulting from the second-quarter acquisition of a refinery
in Texas City, Texas.
   Other commodity trading operations incurred a combined loss of
$15 million, compared with a $5 million profit in the third quarter
of last year.
   In the first nine months of the year, Salomon's profit rose 47.2
percent _ to $318 million, or $2 a share, from $216 million, or
$1.40 a share.
   Nine-month revenue decreased to $4.33 billion from $4.67 billion.

<TEXT>
   America's international debt is far
smaller than the government's figures indicate, according to a new
study whose authors say misleading figures have led to exaggerated
fears of economic decline.
   The United States, said by the Commerce Department to have become
a net debtor nation in 1985, actually remained in the black until
last year, according to the study by the Rand Corp.
   ``The big point about this is...that the public debate has been
misinformed and ill-served by frequent reiteration of flawed
numbers,'' Charles Wolf Jr., director of Rand's international
economic policy research, said Tuesday.
   The figure in question, called the U.S. international investment
position, is a cumulative total of all American spending and
investment overseas compared to foreign spending and investment in
this country.
   The study by the government-funded think tank indicates that in
1985, when Commerce Department figures showed the United States was
a net debtor to the tune of $112 billion, the country actually was a
$178 billion net creditor. In 1986, when the government figure was a
minus $263 billion, the Rand recalculation had the country a
creditor nation by $50 billion.
   In 1988, government figures indicated the country was $368
billion in debt. Rand researchers haven't calculated their version
of the 1988 number, but know it would be negative, Wolf said.
   The Rand study, conducted under Wolf's direction by University of
Michigan graduate student Sarah A. Hooker, adjusts the government's
measures in several ways:
   _It converts ``direct investment,'' the department's measure of
private holdings of foreign capital, including real estate, to
current dollar value. Because much American investment overseas was
made years ago, when the dollar was worth less than today, this
increases the vaue of Americans' foreign holdings relative to
foreigners' more recent investments in this country.
   _It boosts the value of U.S. gold reserves, another component of
the Commerce Department figure, by using a market price of $380 per
ounce rather than the department's ``official'' price of $42.22 an
ounce.
   _On the negative side, the researchers cut the value of loans
owed to U.S. banks by developing nations. Based on the theory that
many of these shaky loans will never be repaid, the study fixed
their value at what they would bring on the secondary market, where
banks trade debts of various kinds.
   These adjustments reflect previously voiced criticism of the
Commerce Department figures. But the researchers believe they are
the first to actually recalculate the department numbers based on
the criticism, Wolf said.
   Even after the changes, the numbers show a steady slide in the
U.S. position. That isn't necessarily bad, Wolf said, to the extent
that it represents foreigners' confidence in the United States
economy as a safe, stable haven for their money.
   ``The point is, you don't contribute to what we like to think of
as an informed and educated debate by using figures that are $300
million off the mark,'' Wolf said. ``...There's a perception problem
in how you view the situation: Is it grave, or serious, or just a
matter of concern. ...I think it's a matter of concern.''

   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. reported Tuesday it had a
63 percent jump in its third-quarter income, while the Washington
Post Co. reported its profit was down by 39.6 percent from a
year-earlier period when it had large one-time gains.
   Capital Cities-ABC, which owns the ABC television network and
other broadcast and print properties, said it earned $62.6 million,
or $3.55 a share, during the quarter ended Sept. 30. That was up
from $38.4 million, or $2.23 a share, in the same period of 1987.
   The company reported revenue of nearly $1.01 billion, up from
$946.21 billion in the third quarter a year earlier.
   Washington Post Co. reported from Washington that it had a profit
of $38.1 million, or $2.96 per share, in the three months ended
Sept. 30, compared with $63.1 million, or $4.77 per share, in the
year-earlier period. Sales rose to $329.4 million from $312.9
million in third-quarter 1987.
   Capital Cities-ABC said its broadcasting operations had a 24
percent rise in income, while income from its publishing operations
was flat.
   For the first nine months of the year, Capital Cities-ABC said it
earned $246.9 million, or $14.43 a share, up from $162.1 million, or
$9.56 a share, in the same period of 1987.
   The company reported nine-month revenue of $3.46 billion, up from
$3.03 billion a year earlier.
   Capital-Cities-ABC also owns six radio networks, eight television
stations and 21 radio stations. It provides programming for cable
television, and its publishing businesses includes daily and weekly
newspapers, specialty and business periodicals and books.
   The third quarter 1987 profit for Washington Post Co. included
one-time after-tax gains of $30.2 million, or $2.35 per share, from
the sales of certain cellular telephone and SportsChannel cable
television interests.
   Newspaper division revenue increased 8 percent in the third
quarter over the comparable period last year, according to the
company report. Post-Newsweek television stations' revenue was up 5
percent in the third quarter, and cable division revenue increased
17 percent.
   For the nine months, the company had a profit of $232.2 million,
or $18.04 per share, compared with $122.3 million, or $9.51 per
share, in the same period of 1987. Revenue during the nine months
rose to $996.8 million from $950.4 million.

   Kimberly-Clark Corp. on Tuesday reported its net
income rose by 7.6 percent in the third quarter from the same period
last year, aided by strong sales of disposable diapers.
   The Dallas-based manufacturer of Huggies diapers, Kleenex facial
tissue and other household and health care products, posted a profit
of $90.5 million, or $1.12 per share, compared with $84.1 million,
or 98 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.
   Sales during the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $1.4 billion
from $1.2 billion a year earlier.
   Distribution of Huggies ``Supertrim'' diapers was completed
during the quarter and the company said sales volume reflected
completion of the rollout of the new product.
   For the nine-month period, net income rose to $283.9 million, or
$3.53 per share, from $243 million, or $2.74 per share, a year
earlier. Sales during the period rose to $4 billion from $3.63
billion.
   In addition to personal products, Kimberly-Clark produces
newsprint and business, correspondence and specialty papers.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Del Webb Corp. and The Golden Nugget Inc. said
Tuesday they had mutually terminated their Oct. 2 preliminary
agreement under which Golden Nugget was to acquire the Claridge
Hotel-Casino in Atlantic City, N.J. for $110 million.
   In a news release, Del Webb said various difficulties had made it
impossible to proceed with a definitive agreement.
   A primary difficulty was a determination that certain operational
changes requested by Golden Nugget from the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission could not be granted under applicable law, Del
Webb stated. The company did not elaborate.
   Del Webb, which has a 10 percent interest in the Claridge, has
the management contract for the facility.
   The company and Atlantic City Boardwalk Associates have been
seeking a possible buyer since May for the 501-room Claridge. Hotel
president Roger Wagner had indicated that more than 170 potential
purchasers contacted Del Webb's investment banker, Oppenheimer &
Co., about the Claridge.
   Del Webb suffered a $96.6 million net loss in 1987, with the
Claridge responsible for 78.8 percent of the loss.
   Philip J. Dion, chairman and chief executive officer of Webb,
said the company had presented to the NJCCC a restructuring proposal
for the Claridge which substantially reduced the facility's debt and
would allow it to operate on a solid financial basis.
   The proposal, which is awaiting commission approval, was
developed by Del Webb prior to the Oct. 2 announcement of the
preliminary agreement with The Golden Nugget, the company said.
   Del Webb has been selling off assets in its leisure group, which
includes other casino and recreational properties. Late in
September, Golden Nugget Chairman Steve Wynn closed a deal to
purchase the Nevada Club casino in Laughlin, Nev., from Del Webb for
$40 million.
   Wynn left the Atlantic City casino industry in 1987 when he sold
the Golden Nugget hotel-casino in the resort town to Bally
Manufacturing Corp. for $440 million.

<HEAD>China To Impose Export Tax on Silk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Wednesday will begin levying export
tariffs of up to 100 percent on silk and its products to stop a
``silk cocoon war'' that has pushed up prices.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the 100 percent tariff will
be levied on silkworm cocoon, raw silk, waste silk, silk yarn and
spun silk. Duties on silk, silk noil and fabrics made of waste silk
will be 80 percent, it said.
   The new duties, announced by the Customs Tariff Commission and
the General Administration of Customs, will affect all silk exports
regardless of when contracts were signed.
   China produces about 50,000 tons of cocoon silk annually, of
which 70 percent is for export. Ninety percent of raw silk and 40
percent of gray silk goods on international markets come from China,
according to the official China Daily.
   The Chinese government last month stated the China National Silk
Import and Export Corporation will undertake the unified handling of
silkworm cocoons, including exports, to halt the price war among
trading companies competing for scarce cocoons.
   It banned all other departments and individuals from purchasing
or handling silkworm cocoons and said Sino-foreign joint ventures
must apply for export permits in accordance with state-assigned
export quotas.
   Despite increasing demand for Chinese silk, cocoon production has
declined recently due to bad weather and low state-set prices.
Factories in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities have been forced to
stop production because of shortages of cocoons and filature silk.
   China Daily reported last week that Chinese silk traders were
turning down new customers at the Canton Trade Fair and there would
be a sharp drop in export contracts compared with previous fairs. It
said Chinese silk prices have risen by about 20 percent since last
spring.

<HEAD>Winner Of Disputed Proxy Election Seated On Scherer Board</HEAD>

   The formal seating Tuesday of Theodore Souris,
winner of a disputed proxy election to the R.P. Scherer Corp. board
of directors, ended a successful battle by dissidents aiming to
force the sale of the pharmaceutical supply company.
   Souris was seated during the final session of Scherer's annual
shareholders meeting, the company said in a statement.
   Results of the proxy election he won Aug. 17 were accepted after
the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled Oct. 5 against challenges filed
by the corporation and the board candidate he defeated, the
statement said.
   The dissident group was led by Karla Scherer Fink and John
Scherer, children of the company's founder. Ms. Fink also is the
estranged wife of Peter Fink, the company's president and chief
executive, who opposes a sale of Scherer.
   John Scherer won uncontested re-election to the board, as did
Peter Fink.
   Souris's seating Tuesday marked the first time the board was at
full strength since Aug. 17, when he and New York investment banker
Frederick Frank won the seats held by incumbent directors Peter Dow
and Richard Manoogian, the statement said.
   Scherer stock closed Tuesday at $32.12{ a share, down 25 cents
from Monday's close in national over-the-counter trading.
   R.P. Scherer manufactures gelatin capsules for the pharmaceutical
and nutritional industries. It employs about 2,800 people at 22
facilties in 13 countries.
