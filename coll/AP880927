   President Reagan told the United Nations
in a farewell speech Monday that this was ``a moment of hope'' for
peace in the world and that a new U.S.-Soviet treaty to sharply
reduce nuclear arms may be concluded next year.
   He called for an international war on drug traffickers,
terrorism and hostage-taking, and vowed to maintain U.S. support
for an armed insurgency against the leftist government of Nicaragua.
   He said the Sandinistas were pursuing ``the oldest, most corrupt
vice of all _ man's age-old will to power, his lust to control the
lives and steal the freedoms of others.''
   But with his presidency nearing an end, Reagan struck a mostly
philosophical stance as he told the 43rd General Assembly session
of 159 nations that civil wars and foreign occupations were giving
way around the world.
   Reagan said the trend was spurred by ``a new era in
Soviet-American relations'' marked by the continuing withdrawal of
the Red Army from Afghanistan and a treaty last year to abolish
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   He said U.S. and Soviet negotiators were making steady progress
on another accord to sharply reduce long-range bombers, missiles
and submarines. While completion of the pact this year was ``highly
doubtful,'' Reagan said, ``I can tell you a year from now (it) is a
possibility, more than a possibility.''
   On the conventional front, Reagan said East-West talks to reduce
non-nuclear forces, tanks and other mobile weapons in Europe ``will
begin soon.''
   The United States had demanded a Soviet commitment to give equal
attention to human rights. Reagan met last week in Washington with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Afterward, U.S. officials said the Soviets had promised to
release 27 additional political prisoners, to make changes in their
emigration procedures and to undertake other reforms. Reagan's
statement indicated the human rights obstacle had been removed.
   After the speech, Reagan met with Foreign Ministers Esmat Abdel
Meguid of Egypt and Shimon Peres of Israel on prospects for peace
in the Middle East.
   Chatting with reporters during a picture-taking session, Reagan
said he had ``high hopes'' for release of the nine American
hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian forces.
   ``But I'm superstitious about calling a no-hitter before the
game is over,'' Reagan said.
   The former baseball broadcaster appeared to be referring to the
progressive release of French and West German hostages _ and being
reluctant to talk about it for fear of upsetting the situation.
   But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said ``there is
no morsel of information that gives us reason to be more hopeful.''
   In the session with Meguid and Peres, the president called the
1979 peace treaty between their countries ``a monumental
achievement which has changed the face of the region.''
   He said the U.S. goal was to move beyond it to an overall
settlement that took into account the ``legitimate rights'' of
Palestinian Arabs.
   According to Israeli sources, who declined to be further
identified, Peres said that his government would not deal with
Arafat and the Palestine ration Organization so long as they were
involved in terrorism and violence and speak of trying to force
Israel back to the partition lines set by the United Nations in
1947.
   Secretary of State George Shultz, meanwhile, said despite
elections in the United States and Israel in November the parties
should keep working for negotiations since ``a vacuum is very
dangerous.''
   In other developments on a busy day in New York, Reagan:
   _Met twice with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
to assess prospects of ending the Persian Gulf war. It was Reagan's
first meeting with Perez de Cuellar since the White House's
announcement on Sept. 13 that the president was releasing $188
million the United States had withheld from the organization to
show displeasure with U.N. budgetary and hiring practices.
   _Scheduled a meeting with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former
ruler of Cambodia, in Washington on Oct. 11. The purpose is to
underscore U.S. support for his forces as they compete with the
Khmer Rouge to take control of the country from pro-Vietnam
authorities.
   _Met with President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to register U.S.
resolve for successful completion of negotiations that
simultaneously would withdraw Cuban troops from Angola and South
Africa from Namibia.
   _Met with leaders of Persian Gulf countries after deciding to
end the U.S. military convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers.
U.S. officials stressed American warships would remain in the gulf
prepared to come to the aid of commercial ships under attack.
   The president's speech was the most upbeat of the seven speeches
he has made before the world body.
   From Angola to Cambodia, and in the Persian Gulf, where Perez de
Cuellar is trying to formalize a cease-fire to end the eight-year
war between Iran and Iraq, prospects for peace are bright, Reagan
said.
   Fitzwater said earlier Monday that Reagan had decided to end the
14-month program of providing U.S. Navy escorts to re-flagged
Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, but he still would
maintain a naval presence there to aid threatened ships.
   Fitzwater told reporters that Reagan acted ``after reviewing the
current cease-fire ... which has been in effect since August 20,
and consulting with allies and friends in the region.''
   In his speech, Reagan said, ``I stand at this podium, then, in a
moment of hope _ hope not just for the peoples of the United States
or the Soviet Union, but for all the peoples of the world.''
   In arms control, he said, ``the logjam is broken'' by the ban on
U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range missiles, progress toward a
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and the onset of negotiations
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact
on conventional forces.
   ``History teaches caution,'' Reagan said. But his speech was
upbeat, and he traced the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations to
the first summit meeting he had held with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in Geneva nearly three years ago.
   ``So if future generations do say of us that, in our time, peace
came closer, that we did bring about new seasons of truth and
justice, it will be cause for pride,'' Reagan said.

   A member of the Canadian Snowbirds precision
military flying team was drunk when he crashed his car and died on
the day he was to perform at an air show, authorities said Monday.
   Capt. Wesley MacKay, 28, of Camrose, Alberta, had an alcohol
concentration of 0.191 percent in his blood, said Skip Rusciewicz,
deputy coroner for Westmoreland County. Pennsylvania law recognizes
0.10 as the level of intoxication.
   The crash occurred on a private road around 1 a.m. Saturday,
police said. The Snowbirds were to perform 14 hours later.
   The pilots are not allowed to consume alcohol within eight hours
of a flight, said Col. Claude Thibault, commander of Canadian
Forces Base in Moose Jaw.
   Two other team members were injured in the crash.

<HEAD>FAA Chief Says Air Safety Improving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aviation safety is improving, and
technology and training programs are now in place to prevent most
major air disasters, the director of the Federal Aviation
Administration said Monday.
   ``I reject any notion from anybody that would assert that
aviation safety is somehow declining,'' Allan McArtor said during a
visit to the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City.
   Near-collision reports are down 67 percent from last year; pilot
errors are down 63 percent and controller errors are down 18
percent, McArtor said.
   Also down are aviation-related fatalities and delays, he said.
   ``Aviation safety is improving. That does not mean aviation
safety cannot continue to improve. We have a lot of work to do. But
we should never be caught in the trap of assuming that accident
rates reflect aviation safety,'' he said, explaining that as air
travel increases, the number of accidents also would increase.
   Technological advancements in such things as radar, combined
with improved pilot training programs have reduced the danger of
wind shear to air travelers, McArtor said.
   ``Wind shear has been with us since the dawn of aviation. But
just now, we have the technology and the training that can
recognize these microburst conditions,'' he said.
   He referred to sudden shifts in wind direction and speed caused
when a mass of cooled air rushes downward out of a thunderstorm, a
condition that can especially endanger planes taking off and
landing.
   Just last week, the FAA announced that airplanes themselves will
now be required to carry equipment that can detect wind shear, and
to display steering commands so pilots can escape the conditions,
McArtor said.
   In addition, he said all airlines are now training pilots in
simulators to recognize conditions of wind shear and to escape from
them safely.
   He said the 1985 crash of a Delta Airlines flight in Dallas that
killed 137 people probably could have been prevented if such
measures had been in place at the time.

   A neighborhood trying to buck bureaucracy,
middlemen and rising inflation has created China's first consumer
food cooperative in 30 years.
   The Tiantan Residential Area Consumer Cooperative in Beijing
opened in April and already has 9,000 members who paid 5 yuan
($1.30) a share for access to fresh and sometimes cheaper
vegetables, milk, eggs, matches, food oils and other consumer goods.
   ``Our only purpose is to serve the people,'' said the co-op's
general manager, Yang Jingson.
   It is run entirely by people living near the landmark Temple of
Heaven in southern Beijing.
   Consumer cooperatives existed in the early years after the
Communist government came to power in 1949, but were taken over by
the state in 1957, ``when our economy became more developed,'' Yang
said.
   The idea has been revived three decades later as China goes
through the painful process of ending price controls and letting
the value of most food products be determined by market forces.
   Prices for many vegetables and other food items have doubled in
the past year amid an overall inflation rate of around 20 percent.
The reluctance of farmers to grow low-profit crops, difficulties in
transport and widespread profiteering in scarce commodities have
added to the price spiral, the most serious problem facing the
Chinese economy today.
   The Tiantan Neighborhood Committee decided to start the co-op,
Yang said, mainly to ``eliminate all kinds of troubles happening
between producers and consumers.''
   The cooperative has signed contracts with several farm villages
outside Beijing for supply and delivery of cucumbers, milk, sesame
oil and other items, which are stocked in some of the 40 shops now
run by the cooperative.
   Most of the 100 people working for the cooperative are retired
from regular jobs or unemployed, Yang said.
   Zhang Xuyuan, 69, said she came out of retirement to run a
little corner shop that sells soft drinks, canned goods and fresh
foods because ``I wanted something to do.''
   Now, she says she works up to 12 hours a day and takes home a
wage pegged to the shop's sales and averaging about 100 yuan ($27)
a month, on a par with a factory worker's salary.
   Shoppers, she said, are ``quite satisfied, they've got no
quarrels'' with the cooperative products.
   Yang said the little groceries barely break even, but the
cooperative is earning good profits from several larger retail
stores.
   He said shareholders should receive dividends larger than
interest rates on bank savings deposits.
   He added that as China switches to a commodity-based economy,
the government permits consumers to have various shopping options.
   The co-op, he said, will be a ``little brother'' to state-owned
food shops and will not hurt the free markets that now supply urban
residents with much of their better-quality if more expensive food.
   Although elimination of middlemen will mean better prices for
co-op members, Yang said, prices will generally be pegged to those
in state stores but that holding the line on price rises will be
tough.
   He expressed confidence, however, that the co-op could provide
good service at reasonable prices, ``and make things a little
easier for our residents.''

   President P.W. Botha completes
10 years in power Wednesday, pressing ahead with policies that have
disenchanted blacks and whites across South Africa's political
spectrum.
   Not interested in charming his way to popularity, Botha has
presented himself as a stern, dedicated patriot leading his country
on a precarious path between outright racism and black majority
rule.
   Lately, his balancing act has won little praise. Growing numbers
of right-wing whites feel he has gone too far in extending power to
blacks, while white liberals and a solid core of blacks believe he
has fallen woefully short.
   The criticisms, and increasingly frequent calls for new
leadership, sometimes rankle Botha, but he is unapologetic.
   ``My attitude is that I am doing what I believe to be right and
in the interests of the country,'' he recently told a television
interviewer who sought an assessment of 10 turbulent years.
   In his early years in power, Botha had a broad mandate from
whites for his twin goals of maintaining stability while moving
away from rigid apartheid.
   The Sunday Times, South Africa's largest newspaper and a critic
of the government, commented this month, ``Mr. Botha's place in
history is assured. It required courage to lead his people out of
the cul-de-sac of apartheid, even if the final destination of their
new course remains uncharted.''
   Botha, 72, became head of the white-minority government on Sept.
28, 1978, when Parliament members elected him prime minister over
more moderate and more conservative rivals.
   He had been in the Cabinet since 1961 and became defense
minister in 1966. His first speech as prime minister stressed a
theme that remains dear to him _ the paramount importance of
national security in the face of a purported communist-led ``total
onslaught.''
   A year later, in one of his most quoted remarks, he sounded a
different theme, telling whites: ``We must adapt, otherwise we will
die.''
   In 1984, Botha helped push through a new constitution that
brought Asians and people of mixed race into the previously
all-white Parliament, but continued to exclude blacks. One result
was black anger that ignited two years of nationwide political
violence.
   The constitution abolished the post of prime minister, and Botha
became president. His critics say he has steadily increased the
power of the executive branch since then while weakening Parliament.
   Since 1984, Botha has been credited with the repeal of several
of apartheid's most hurtful laws, including those that banned
interracial marriages and required blacks to have a permit to be in
whites-only areas.
   These reforms, along with promises of limited power-sharing with
blacks, triggered a wave of defections by Botha's fellow Afrikaners
from the National Party to the extreme-right Conservative Party
   Botha's anniversary comes as the National Party verges on losing
support of a majority of whites for the first time since it gained
power 40 years ago.
   The party won 55 percent of the vote in whites-only general
elections in May 1987, while 26 percent went to the Conservative
Party and 19 percent to liberal candidates.
   The Conservatives are believed to have gained strength since
then and could outpoll the National Party in nationwide local
elections Oct. 26.
   Many liberals believe Botha has gone as far as he is willing to
go toward substantive reform. The president has declared that some
aspects of apartheid are non-negotiable _ he rejects equal voting
rights for blacks and insists that whites retain segregated
neighborhoods and schools.
   ``We are forever told that President Botha's government has
chosen the path fo reform and should be given a chance,'' wrote
black newspaper editor Khulu Sibiya. ``What chance, when they move
one step forward and three backwards?''
   Botha, whose government has detained thousands of black
activists during a 27-month-old state of emergency, says most
blacks view him favorably.
   Opinion polls suggest otherwise.
   This month, Botha held his first summit meetings in black
Africa. He visited Malawi, a longtime friend of South Africa, and
Mozambique, a longtime adversary.
   Some critics say Botha is more willing to take chances in the
international arena than at home.
   ``One has to say that P.W. Botha lacks imagination,'' said Peter
Soal, Parliament member for the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal
Party. ``He has failed to deal creatively with black political
aspirations.''
   Even some of Botha's own Cabinet ministers feel he should step
down, said Soal. ``Is there someone with the guts to tell him?''

<TEXT>
   Ne Win, who resigned two months ago
after 26 years of despotic rule, is widely believed to still be the
top man in Burma orchestrating moves to put down the
anti-government uprising.
   Many Western diplomats and Burmese believe Ne Win has been
calling the shots since he stepped down July 23 as chairman of the
Burma Socialist Program Party that has ruled the country for a
quarter century.
   ``I would say the almost universal perception and opinion among
Burmese is that Ne Win is still the government of Burma,'' a
Rangoon-based diplomat said.
   Ne Win, 77, has remained out of public sight since he resigned,
and there is no indisputable evidence he remains the most powerful
figure.
   But observers characterize the men who have led the government
since he stepped down as long-time associates of Ne Win who dare
not make any major move without his assent.
   Diplomats said military commander Gen. Saw Maung visited Ne Win
at his home in the plush northern Rangoon suburbs around scenic
Inya Lake before launching a coup Sept. 18 that began a harsh
crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.
   The Rangoon-based diplomat said ``a number of (other) meetings
have been held at critical times'' between Ne Win and top officials.
   Sein Lwin, who became head of the party and state to succeed Ne
Win in July, was a military leader known for his ruthlessness and
long-time political association with Ne Win.
   When protests against Sein Lwin's authoritarian rule increased
in August, he was replaced by civilian Maung Maung, who served as
Ne Win's legal adviser and wrote a flattering book about him called
``Burma and General Ne Win.''
   Tzang Yawnghwe, an author and son of Burma's first president,
described Maung Maung as ``one of the few Burmese intellectuals who
sincerely and deeply admired Gen. Ne Win.''
   Maung Maung was removed from power by Saw Maung when promises to
hold the first multiparty elections since 1960 failed to end
massive anti-government street demonstrations and a crippling
general strike.
   Saw Maung, who was promoted to armed forces commander in 1985,
is regarded as a hardliner who during most of his 39-year army
career has loyally followed orders from Ne Win.
   Ne Win ``didn't raise up a generation of leaders but raised a
generation of followers to do his bidding,'' a Bangkok-based
diplomat observed.
   Another diplomat said the three successors are generally viewed
as ``absolutely beholden'' to the charismatic Ne Win, whose
unquestioned supremacy over the capable, well-organized 186,000-man
military since his 1962 coup is seen as the key to his lasting
power.
   The opposition so far has been unable to draw into its fold the
rank-and-file soldiers and their officers, who in the past week
shot and killed largely unarmed, peaceful demonstrators and broke
up dozens of protest centers throughout the nation.
   ``What striking about it is the ruthlessness of his (Ne Win's)
tactics,'' the Bangkok-based diplomat said.
   Japanese Burma expert Minoru Kiryu suggests, however, that
events of recent weeks do not follow a ``Ne Win scenario,'' since
the coup leaders abolished virtually all the state organizations
built up by the military strongman.
   Ne Win first came to prominence as one of Burma's ``Thirty
Comrades'' who played a key role in the fight for independence from
Britain. He ended Burma's shaky post-independence experiment with
democracy by leading the 1962 coup.
   Ne Win quickly vowed to lead his country on a neutralist,
egalitarian and moralistic ``Burmese road to socialism.''
   But inefficiency, corruption and black marketeering soon spread
throughout the system and Burma, rich in natural resources and once
the world's largest exporter of rice, is now one of the world's
poorest nations.
   The failure to oust Ne Win and his cronies despite the popular
uprising has led to ``certainly a tremendous mood of depression and
disillusionment in the country,'' the Rangoon-based diplomat said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Political Millions Dash Proxmire's Illusions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An illusion has been dashed for William
Proxmire, who won his last Senate election in Wisconsin by shaking
scores of thousands of hands and spending $145.
   Proxmire, a member of the Senate since 1957, won that election
in 1982 with 64 percent of the vote and without spending a dime on
television commercials.
   But in the scramble to succeed him _ a scuffle that began when
he announced earlier this year that he would not seek re-election _
a new reality of the American political process emerged.
   Proxmire has found that money does in fact talk.
   The senator predicted the result earlier this year even before
Wisconsin's voters picked free-spending millionaire businessman
Herb Kohl, who never has held public office, as the Democratic
senatorial nominee over a list of veteran politicians.
   Proxmire described to the Senate the way he had established a
victorious and enduring political career by shaking hands and
ringing doorbells. He also correctly described what can happen when
all that hard work comes up against big money.
   ``Meet just as many voters as you can _ day after day, month
after month, year after year,'' Proxmire said in a Senate speech.
   ``The numbers are critical,'' he said. ``They add up. You can
literally meet hundreds every day. By campaigning on main streets
and shopping malls for seven or eight hours a day you can hit a
couple of thousand.
   ``Go out to baseball and football games, state fairs, busy
summer festivals ... and you can meet as many as a thousand an hour
_ literally.
   ``Keep that up year after year and you build remarkable
long-term support,'' he said. ``When you run statewide a few times
... an astonishing number remember you. Many of the
hundred-thousand people you met in your 1952 campaign for governor
still remember meeting you when they vote in 1982.
   ``With every election that passes you have more of those
beautiful voters in the bank.''
   It was a ``magic'' that never failed him.
   But it was not a road that Kohl, a relatively unknown face,
chose to follow.
   According to Proxmire, Kohl got his name recognition with money,
not by meeting voters one after the other.
   ``All that magic can blow away like a puff of smoke in a
hurricane when your opponent turns up with $2 million or $3 million
to buy television time and the good judgment of the experts to tell
him precisely how to build on it,'' he said.
   Kohl's Republican opponent, Susan Engeleiter, minority leader of
the Wisconsin state Senate, also is mounting an extensive and
expensive television campaign but is expected to be outspent by
Kohl, who had pumped $4 million into his campaign by the end of
August.
   Proxmire said that as a result of Kohl's heavy spending in the
Democratic primary campaign, ``the three Democratic candidates,
qualified by years of service in public office and with long
campaigning, were left far behind in the dust.''
   Proxmire's conclusion: ``Building constituent support one on
one, serving well in public office, can help build a political
career, but there is no substitute for money, and lots of it,
wisely spent in buying the most seasoned and shrewd media advice
and the television time to ring that bell.
   ``The candidate who has come from nowhere has been a smashing
success in business,'' Proxmire said. ``He may, if elected, serve
the country and our state as an excellent senator.''
   ``But as a retiring senator who followed the other painstaking
route of years of one-to-one hard campaigning work,'' Proxmire
said, ``I am disillusioned _ and more than a little jealous.''

<TEXT>
   The USS New Jersey nearly ran down a
yacht carrying anti-nuclear demonstrators as the battleship
maneuvered into Sydney harbor today through a flotilla of yachts,
canoes and surfboards.
   The New Jersey's skipper, Capt. Douglas Katz, said his
57,000-ton battlewagon would probably have sunk the yacht had it
had not been dragged clear at the last moment.
   ``If it had not been for that police boat pulling it off we'd
have split it in half,'' Katz said. ``The guy on that police boat
was very brave.''
   The police boat managed to secure the yacht and tow it clear
seconds before the battleship steamed by.
   Other protesters in assorted small craft attempted to get
alongside the ship and plaster it with anti-nuclear slogans, but
were kept away by a cordon of police and Australian navy speed
boats.
   Police and navy divers jumped into the water to arrest two
protesters.
   Katz, 46, of Bluefield, W. Va., said demonstrators, some of them
from the international environmental group Greenpeace, risked their
lives coming so close to the New Jersey because turbulence from the
ship's four 18-foot propellors could have sucked them under water.
   The New Jersey is visiting Australia with an international fleet
of more than 40 warships to celebrate the bicentennial of European
settlement of Australia.
   Anti-nuclear demonstrators were protesting the New Jersey's
presence because it carries Tomahawk cruise missiles. The U.S. Navy
refuses to confirm or deny whether the missiles carry nuclear
warheads.
   The New Jersey, built in 1943, is powered by old-fashioned
oil-fired steam engines. It was followed into Sydney Harbor by the
British aircraft carrier Ark Royal and four warships of the Royal
Dutch Navy.
   Sailors from 16 nations will march through Sydney's streets on
Thursday.
   On Saturday, Prince Andrew of Britain and his wife the former
Sarah Ferguson will review the fleet from the deck of an Australian
warship, HMAS Cook.

<HEAD>EPA Stance On Ozone-Destroying Compounds Is Cheered By
Environmentalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Environmentalists hailed a call by the
Environmental Protection Agency for a global ban on
ozone-destroying chloroflurocarbons and related compounds.
   ``We're glad to see they've come around to our way of
thinking,'' said Liz Cook of Friends of the Earth.
   The announcement Monday by EPA administrator Lee M. Thomas
marked a shift from his view that there was plenty of time to
consider what, if any, steps were needed to tighten the terms of an
existing international treaty on reducing CFC production.
   That treaty, signed by 45 major nations, pledges signatories to
a 50 percent cut by 1998.
   The CFC compounds are widely used as refrigeration fluids,
solvents and foam blowing agents and, outside the United States, as
aerosol propellants. Related bromine compounds are used in fire
extinguishers. Some can last for more than a century, rising to the
stratosphere where they eventually break down to liberate chlorine.
   A major study of ozone by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration last March found ozone depletion of as much as 3
percent at mid-latitudes and attributed it to chlorine.
   Without cutting off production of CFCs, chlorine and bromine
will continue to build up in the atmosphere, destroying
high-altitude ozone that protects the Earth from the sun's
ultra-violet rays, the EPA said in a new analysis released Monday.
   ``It is increasingly clear that we as a global environmental
community must use the (treaty) to go even further to eliminate
these chemicals which damage the stratospheric ozone layer and
threaten our future,'' Thomas said in a statement.
   ``Regretfully, our new analysis predicts an even worse scenario
than anticipated,'' he added.
   Up to now, Thomas had resisted environmentalist recommendations
for a CFC-phaseout. In his remarks Monday, Thomas mentioned no
specific timetable for a phase out.
   David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmentalist group, said the EPA announcement ``underlines the
seriousness of the emergency we are facing.''
   Doniger predicted the report would ``have a lot of impact'' on
major CFC producers abroad.
   Also on Monday, the major trade association of CFC makers and
users, the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, announced it,
too, now believed the nations of the world should aim at ``phasing
out ... CFCs to the maximum extent feasible.''
   Kevin Fay, executive director of the users-producers group, said
the phasing out approach probably would mean some CFCs would
continue to be in use into the 21st century.
   ``We will be working with other trade groups around the world
trying to line up support'' for a phaseout of CDC production and
use, Fay said.
   Environmentalist groups have suggested 1995 as a target date for
ending CFC production.
   John Hoffman, co-author of the EPA analysis, said the failure of
computer models to predict past ozone depletion leads EPA to shy
away from ozone predictions and to zero in on chlorine buildup
instead. Any increases in chlorine raise the risk of ozone
depletion, he said.
   Currently, EPA estimates worldwide atmospheric chlorine at 2.7
parts per billion. Others last year put the figure at 3 parts per
billion, which represents about a 25 percent increase in the past
decade. By some estimates, half the total comes from natural
sources such as sea spray.
   In the past, EPA has said an immediate 85 percent reduction in
the major CFC compounds would be needed to keep chlorine from
rising.
   But those estimates did not include non-CFC chemicals that yield
chlorine, notably methyl chloroform, the most widely used
industrial solvent. If use of that compound continues to grow, the
current level of chlorine in the atmosphere would triple by 2075,
the EPA said. Even if the growth of methyl chloroform use was
halted, the level of chlorine in the atmosphere would double by
2075, it said.
   ``An immediate 100 percent reduction in the use of all (of the
most powerful) compounds and a freeze in methyl chloroform would be
needed'' by all countries to stabilize chlorine, EPA said. By
``immediate,'' it said it meant 1990.
   This would permit use of less powerful CFC compounds to grow
throughout the next century while still holding the chlorine
increase to less than 1 part per billion by 2100.

<HEAD>Plan For Sunday Ferry Sailings Inflames Hebridean Passions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TARBERT, Outer Hebrides (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a whiff of fire and
brimstone in the Outer Hebrides these days as the islanders of
Lewis and Harris prepare to defend their Sabbath against a ferry
invasion from the Scottish mainland.
   Life is rugged in these treeless, windswept peatlands, and
Sunday is the high point of a week otherwise spent fishing, tending
sheep and weaving Harris tweed. Pubs and playgrounds close on
Sundays, flights are suspended, TV and newspapers are shunned and
the only travel is to church.
   Thus to these flinty Presbyterians, the decision by the
Caledonian MacBrayne ferry company to begin Sunday sailings next
summer is a threat to civilization as they know it. They see
tourists and trucks shattering the Sabbath peace.
   The company has sought to allay these fears by modifying its
itinerary so that ferries will sail out but not in, but the
islanders say Hebridean harbor staff will still be forced to go to
work instead of to church.
   ``The people of these islands value their principles, their
Sunday, their way of life, and we are determined to protect these
to the bitter end,'' says John Murdo Morrison, a hotelier in
Tarbert, where the ferry is to dock.
   But other forces are at work. Calmac, as the ferry company is
known, is to be privatized under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
drive to sell off state-owned industries, and it says that once
exposed to market forces, ferries cannot lie idle on Sundays.
   Thus the Thatcherite imperatives of free enterprise are bumping
up against ancient traditions in what The Sunday Times in London
calls ``Britain's deepest cultural battle.''
   Donald McLeod, a fisherman, vows to lead a blockade of Tarbert's
tiny harbor when sailings commence next summer, and Calmac, which
has served the Hebrides for more than a century, says it may ask
the Royal Navy to step in.
   Calmac, warns Morrison, is ``sailing into a horrendous Hebridean
hurricane.''
   Denunciations have poured forth from the pulpits, and The
Stornoway Gazette and Local Advertiser is filled with angry letters.
   ``Sunday sailors will be cursed,'' writes reader N.M. MacLean,
while John MacRae turns to verse: ``The forces of evil are in
battle array@ to destroy the Sabbath wherever they may... We would
resolve, as Shadrach of old@ That we will not bow to their image of
gold.''
   At a time when much of Britain is jumping through hoops in the
chase for tourists, it's refreshing to find a place that is
actively fighting to keep them out.
   Sandy Matheson, head of the Hebridean local authority, concedes
that ``some see us as cranky individuals,'' but she believes the
cause is just.
   ``We have a day apart. The mainland of Britain has no day apart.
It suffers from the most appalling problems of urbanization,
anti-social behavior, vandalism,'' he said in an interview in his
office in Stornoway, the Hebridean capital.
   ``Now why on earth are we going to change by giving up our day
apart which we deem to be so precious?''
   Calmac director Colin Paterson says he understands the
islanders' sensitivities, but believes that plenty of islanders
want a Sunday service, and he sees nothing unChristian about using
it.
   Peter McKibbin, a retired Stornoway businessman and lone voice
in favor of Sunday sailings, says the opposition is confined to one
segment of the archipelago _ the adjoining islands of Lewis and
Harris.
   On these islands the population of 22,000 is solidly
Presbyterian. Further south, on the Uists, Benbecula and Barra, the
9,000 islanders are predominantly Roman Catholic, Sabbath rules are
less stern, and there have been few objections to Sunday sailings.
   Calmac's compromise plan entails the ferry leaving Tarbert on
Sunday for Uig on the mainland and not returning to Tarbert until
Monday.
   But Morrison says it's ``the thin end of a wedge,'' because once
the principle is established, Sunday sailings into Tarbert will
follow.
   Paterson, he says, is an Englishman who cannot understand the
islanders' preoccupations. ``I was born in this village, I was
brought up in it, and I intend to make sure that it's not going to
be eroded by Sassenachs,'' he said, using the Scottish pejorative
for Englishmen.
   ``You must not become a slave to tourism,'' he said, ``because
you lose your identity once that happens.''

<TEXT>
   No matter the care taken and the tests
conducted, eventually there will be another space accident and the
Marshall Space Flight Center probably will once again be the target
of the nation's anger and anguish.
   That, says J. R. Thompson, director of Marshall, is a truth
engineers learn to live with at the NASA center that designs and
develops the most dangerous parts of a space machine.
   ``Ours are the two high-risk elements _ the shuttle main engine
and the shuttle solid rocket,'' Thompson said in an interview at
the facility in the forested hills of northern Alabama. ``In 9
chances out of 10, when there is a catastrophic failure, it will
rest with those two elements.''
   ``When a mission goes good, the focus is going to be on the
operations end,'' he said. ``When things go amiss, the attention is
going to be right here ... It's not an unfair thing. We're big boys
and we know that's the job we've got.''
   A presidential commission concluded that the explosion that
destroyed Challenger and killed its seven crew members on Jan. 28,
1986, was caused by a flawed solid rocket booster that blowtorched
against the external tank.
   Marshall engineers became personal targets of blame. Their
judgment was ridiculed, their diligence belittled and their
competence questioned.
   Larry Mulloy, who headed the solid rocket booster program at
Marshall, received hate mail and endured the collapse of a 23-year
career at NASA. William Lucas, director at Marshall, resigned, with
parting, bitter shots at the press. Ten other managers also left,
retiring or seeking jobs in private industry.
   None of the more than 3,400 workers at Marshall escaped the
stain.
   ``It was devastating,'' said Bob Erwin, an engineer who analyzes
stresses on the spacecraft. ``Everybody was pretty low. There was
not so much a sense of guilt as of loss. There was also the sense
of professional embarrassment. Something had gone terribly wrong
and Marshall was responsible.''
   The drumbeat of blame, recalled Jerry Patterson, an organic
chemist and materials expert, seemed to last forever.
   ``All the nails were driven in place and we were just hanging
there and they were still beating on us,'' he said. ``Eventually it
got to be too much ... We had accepted the responsibility. What we
had to do then was make it right.''
   That involved the most massive effort at reevaluation, repair
and redesign ever attempted by NASA.
   Teams of engineers at Marshall dissected every piece of hardware
developed at the Alabama center. Every design was reexamined. Every
test was checked over and new ones were ordered where needed.
   Work days stretched from 10 to 12 to 14 hours, and, for many,
weekends were forgotten.
   Thompson said more tests were made on the main engines and on
the solid rocket boosters than were conducted before the shuttle
first flew in 1981. The goal was not to find out if the equipment
was just ``good enough,'' but to demonstrate that it was better
than it had to be.
   The full-scale solid rocket engine, with a new design for the
flawed joint, was fired five times at a test site in Utah by its
manufacturer, Morton Thiokol Inc. There were hundreds of other
firings using sub-scale models or partial propellant loads.
   In one full-scale test, flaws were intentionally introduced to
see if the new rocket had a margin of safety. It was a test never
before attempted in the solid rocket industry.
   ``A lot of people inside and outside the agency didn't like that
test because they thought it was pushing the engine too far,'' said
Thompson. If it had failed, it could have caused a long delay in
shuttle flights. But Thompson and the Marshall engineers insisted
because, he said, they ``believed in our design and wanted to go
out on the test stand and prove it.''
   The new rocket engine passed the test with margin to spare.
   Before Challenger, engineers recalled, dissent against consensus
technical views was discouraged. Public differences of opinion were
rare and quickly silenced.
   ``You were part of a team and it seemed a betrayal to take a
contrary view,'' said one engineer.
   Challenger changed that.
   ``The accident strengthened the hand of the engineers in the
trenches,'' said Erwin. ``Before, if you objected to something the
manager could say you were overcautious because we had never had an
accident. Now if a manager wants to yield to schedule pressures, we
tell him that he's on his own.''
   The new openness has resulted in conflicts unknown before
Challenger. In one case, some experts believed a material in a
solid rocket part needed one more test and refused to approve its
use despite pressure from a manager. At conferences, it has become
common for engineers to stand up and object to positions taken by
their own managers.
   ``You admire a guy who has the courage to take a position
different from the crowd,'' Thompson said. ``But that doesn't mean
it's a democracy. You're not going to launch with a democracy.
You've got to have certain people in the system who make decisions
and go.''

   The nation's welfare system is headed for a
major overhaul with the conclusion of complex negotiations on a
five-year plan aimed at moving welfare recipients into jobs and
helping them collect more child support.
   The initiative agreed on Monday by Senate, House and White House
negotiators had been close to death all summer as negotiators
sought a balance between conservatives favoring mandatory work and
liberals concerned about increasing benefits to the needy and
motivating people to enter the mainstream workplace.
   ``This was a critical day,'' said Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the subcommittee that handled the House welfare bill,
emerging from Monday's pivotal meeting.
   ``There are some who will not be happy'' with the outcome,
Downey said. But when asked if the package would fly when presented
to about 50 House and Senate conferees late this afternoon, he
said, ``Yes.''
   ``I am very pleased,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
chairman of the House and Senate conferees and the Democratic vice
presidential nominee. ``I think it's a good final resolution of the
differences ... an excellent compromise.''
   Reagan's domestic policy adviser, Charles Hobbs, a participant
in Monday's meeting, offered a conditional endorsement of the
compromise. ``If it's okay with the conferees and if it comes down
the way I understand it, it's probably okay,'' he said.
   The $3.34 billion welfare plan comes in above the Senate's own
$2.8 billion measure but would cost less than half of the initial
$7.1 billion plan passed by the House.
   The cornerstone of the compromise is a Job Opportunities and
Basic Skills (JOBS) program offering welfare parents _ including
those with preschool children _ services such as job search help,
education and job training. Child care and transportation aid would
be available to participants.
   States would have to be serving 7 percent of eligible welfare
recipients by 1990 and 20 percent by 1995. States would be given
$600 million for the JOBS program in 1989, rising to $1.3 billion
in 1995. People moving into jobs would qualify for a year of
transitional child care and Medicaid benefits.
   Twenty-seven states now provide welfare benefits to households
with two unemployed parents. The welfare bill would require those
states to continue and, effective in 1991, would require others to
provide at least six months of benefits a year to such families.
   Starting in 1994, one adult in each two-parent welfare family
would have to perform 16 hours a week of community work, on-the-job
training or other specified work activities. People under 25
without high school diplomas would be able to substitute
participation in an education program leading to a diploma or its
equivalent.
   The bill also makes new demands on states to step up child
support collections from non-custodial parents, including tougher
paternity determination requirements and mandatory wage withholding
upon the court award of support payments.
   The 16-hour-a-week work requirement would affect only about 7
percent of the welfare caseload but was a primary obstacle to
achieving agreement on the overall bill. A handful of House
liberals resisted the provision almost as fiercely as the Reagan
administration insisted it be retained.

   Morton Thiokol, maker of the rocket
booster that caused Challenger's destruction, hopes a successful
launch for Discovery will begin an awakening from a 32-month-long
corporate nightmare.
   It will be the ``final demonstration to our customer NASA and
the country that solid rocket motors are going to be a reliable
contributor to future shuttle successes,'' said Dick Davis, vice
president and assistant general manager of space operations at
Morton Thiokol's Wasatch Operations in Utah.
   Less easily dispatched are the specters of an FBI investigation,
lawsuits by frustrated former employees and a plague of rocket
fuel-related accidents, including an MX missile motor fire that
killed five employees last December.
   The presidential commission that investigated the Jan. 28, 1986,
shuttle disaster found that an O-ring seal on the right booster
rocket had stiffened in freezing pre-launch temperatures, allowing
superheated gas to escape and trigger an explosion.
   Worse, the commission learned that several Morton Thiokol
engineers had argued the night before that just such a disaster
could occur, but were overruled by superiors who told NASA the
launch should proceed.
   In the relentless glare of the postmortem, Morton Thiokol
embarked on an exhaustive booster redesign that kept some 3,000
workers busy on the field joints as well as the case-to-nozzle
motor joint, the nozzle assembly and hundreds of smaller components.
   ``It's been a very difficult period,'' said Davis. ``I don't
think any company is ever prepared for the kind of intense scrutiny
that you get following a tragedy like Challenger.''
   Allan J. McDonald, a Morton Thiokol engineer who had argued
against the Challenger launch, was made vice president of
engineering for space operations _ overseer of the booster redesign.
   His guiding principle in the $500 million effort has been
redundancy: multiple seals, bolts and clamps to contain the 1.1
million pounds of solid fuel that burn in just two minutes.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has borne the
redesign cost and Morton Thiokol agreed to reap no profit.
   Engineers have conducted five $20 million full-scale
test-firings of the redesigned boosters, as well as hundreds of
sub-scale and component tests. A sixth full-scale test is planned
for December.
   With 8,000 employees and an annual payroll of $220 million,
Morton Thiokol Inc. is Utah's largest private employer. The
Chicago-based company also produces munitions, salt and specialty
chemicals, and manufactures first-stage motors for the MX, Trident
2 and Midgetman strategic missiles and propulsion systems for
tactical missiles.
   Tom Russell, a company vice president, said aerospace profits _
which account for more than a quarter of the company's overall
profits _ fell from $96 million in fiscal 1986 to $73 million in
1987, then rose to $80.8 million in 1988.
   Even as Morton Thiokol struggled to recover from Challenger,
accidents further begrimed its public image. On Dec. 29, 1987, five
men were killed when 108,000 pounds of fuel in an MX missile
segment exploded, destroying a $6.2 million building at the complex
75 miles northwest of Salt Lake City. The state cited Morton
Thiokol for six safety violations.
   Just last week, the company acknowledged that an old model of a
nozzle inlet ring had been used in a motor test-fired in August.
Analysis proved new versions had been placed in Discovery's
boosters.
   Morton Thiokol also has been sued by former employees, among
them Roger Boisjoly, another engineer who protested the Challenger
launch and later resigned. His lawsuits, seeking $3 billion, were
recently dismissed.
   In mid-September, two former consultants, Stephen Agee and
Anthony Laine, filed suit contending they were fired for attempting
to bring redesign problems to light. Their suits also claim the
company violated racketeering laws by filing false reports on its
contractual obligations with NASA.
   Agee said on CBS' ``West 57th'' Saturday that the entire booster
system was unsafe and that he ``wouldn't even want to be around
when they assemble the boosters and stack them prior to launch.''
   Discovery's boosters, of course, have long been in place,
assembly on a second set is nearly complete and a third set is
being shipped to the Cape. And Lisa Malone, spokeswoman for the
Kennedy Space Center, expressed confidence in the redesign and
testing the boosters have undergone.
   Morton Thiokol also is the subject of an FBI inquiry into
allegations by Agee, a contract engineer who worked undercover for
the agency during his 4{-month tenure as a safety analyst. Agee
alleged that, among other things, the company had concealed hazards
from NASA.

   Some 4.7 million Americans will have to wait
at least another year for the first raise in the $3.35-an-hour
minimum wage since 1981 as Senate Democrats concede a major
election-year legislative defeat to a Republican filibuster.
   Refusing to bow to GOP demands for a broad-based subminimum
floor under the 50-year-old minimum wage, Democratic leaders on
Monday gave up all hope of raising the pay base by 40 cents to
$3.75 an hour in January.
   ``There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,''
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said on the Senate floor.
``I'm now conceding that the Republican filibuster was successful.''
   Even before Monday's action, the bill faced an uncertain fate in
the House, where there was intense opposition from some southern
and midwestern Democrats.
   ``I think it's a pretty good result,'' said Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``This bill couldn't pass the House. It
wasn't going to pass the Senate unless it was modified.''
   The Senate had been stymied for more than a week by
parliamentary maneuvering on both sides as the two presidential
candidates, Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis,
watched from the sidelines.
   Lacking the 51 votes to effectively couple an increase with
their desire for a 90-day, 80 percent subminimum for newly hired
workers, Republicans refused to allow any votes on the bill itself
or amendments.
   Democrats, meanwhile, lacked the 60 votes necessary to limit the
debate and shut off the filibuster despite the defection of eight
GOP senators to their cause last Friday.
   Each side sought to blame the other, with Democrats maintaining
that Bush could have turned the vote around with a few phone calls
to Republican lawmakers.
   Bush three weeks ago had said he could support a modest increase
_ never specifying how much _ but only if it was coupled with the
creation of a broad subminimum ``training'' wage.
   ``Perhaps the word from the vice president's campaign has not
gotten through to our friends on the other side,'' Byrd said.
``Perhaps it has gotten through. Either way the results are
evident. Some 15 million workers are the loser.''
   The bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., would
have raised the minimum wage in three annual 40-cents-an-hour
increases to $4.55 by 1991, directly benefiting some 15 million
workers now paid less than that, according to Kennedy.
   Republicans blamed Kennedy's refusal to compromise on a lower
figure, such as the $4.25 an hour suggested once by Dole or $4 an
hour as urged by Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.
   But they said Kennedy's refusal to compromise on the so-called
training wage, or the ``youth training wage'' as Quayle called it,
overshadowed everything else.
   ``The real reason this is being pulled down is that the senator
from Massachusetts knows we were on the very edge of passing the
training wage,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the leader of the
Republican opposition.
   ``The fact is that the international trade union movement in
this country will not accept a training wage,'' Hatch said. ``They
consider the minimum wage as their single idea.''
   Hatch had introduced an amendment calling for the 80 percent
subminimum for the first 90 days a new employee is on a company's
payroll, saying it would ``give a chance to those unskilled,
undereducated youths who cannot get into the system any other way.''
   To prevent a vote on the amendment, Kennedy immediately
introduced a substitute that would slightly expand a currently
allowed but little-used $2.85 subminimum for full-time students
working less than 20 hours a week.
   ``If his passes, mine would be gone,'' Hatch said early in the
debate, complaining as did other Republicans that their subminimum
proposal was being denied a fair hearing under Senate rules that
favor whichever party holds a majority.
   Kennedy called Hatch's subminimum amendment a ``Bush hire 'em
and fire 'em wage.''
   Without any requirements for training or age restrictions,
employers would have an incentive to replace their workforces every
90 days with a new group of workers paid the subminimum rate,
Kennedy said.
   Republicans had also pushed as an alternative to a minimum wage
increase an earned income tax credit that would have funneled about
$6 billion in federal subsidies over four years to families headed
by minimum wage earners.
   Kennedy said that alternative, which Republicans conceded would
have to be financed through a tax increase, would leave taxpayers
``subsidizing employers who exploit their workers.''

   The tobacco industry is mounting an expensive
campaign to try to snuff out an Oregon ballot measure that would
create the nation's toughest anti-smoking law.
   But opponents of Measure 6 will have their work cut out for them
because a recent statewide poll found strong public support for it.
   Tobacco companies are using mass mailings of brochures,
newsletters and voter registration kits in hopes of scuttling
Measure 6 on the Nov. 8 ballot.
   ``We're going to spend a lot of money,'' at least several
hundred thousand dollars, said Mark Nelson, a Salem lobbyist who's
running the campaign to defeat Measure 6. ``We're going to make a
major effort on this.''
   The anti-smoking proposal would toughen the 1981 Oregon Indoor
Clean Air Act, which makes most public buildings off limits to
smokers, except in designated smoking areas.
   The new proposal, if approved, would wipe out designated smoking
areas and ban smoking in virtually all indoor work areas and
enclosed places frequented by the public. Violators would be
subject to civil penalties of up to $250.
   Smoking still would be allowed in bars and taverns, tobacco
stores, and hotel and motel rooms.
   The Oregon Lung Association led a petition drive to win a spot
on the ballot for the proposal.
   Gerry Odisio, who is coordinating the campaign for the Lung
Association, said non-smokers should not have to put up with
secondhand smoke in public facilities or workplaces.
   ``What we're talking about is a public health measure,'' Odisio
said. ``We know that secondhand smoke causes disease, including
lung cancer in otherwise healthy non-smokers.''
   ``Study after study has shown unhealthful levels of tobacco
smoke in non-smoking sections,'' she said.
   That is disputed by Maura Payne, spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco USA.
   ``There's no substantive, scientific support for the contention
that environmental tobacco smoke causes any significant threat to
the health of non-smokers,'' she said.
   In a telephone interview from the company's office in
Winston-Salem, N.C., Payne called Measure 6 a dangerous abridgement
of the rights of a minority group _ smokers.
   ``Even if you're a non-smoker, you should be careful of
government infringement on other people's rights,'' she said.
``Maybe next they're going to try to restrict whether people eat
red meat or attend rock concerts that neighbors find too noisy.''
   A former Oregon Supreme Court justice, Betty Roberts, voices
similar concerns about possible infringement of civil liberties.
   In a letter distributed by opponents of Measure 6, Roberts
warned that it would ``authorize search warrants to root out
evidence of illegal smoking, and even bring about police arrests of
fine-ignoring citizens.''
   Odisio dismisses those concerns as unfounded, saying no one has
been fined or taken to court for violating the current law.
   ``It's a self-enforcing law,'' Odisio said. ``It is passed with
the understanding that most Oregon citizens are law-abiding.''
   She said 42 states have some sort of statewide restriction on
smoking, including such things as banning smoking on elevators, and
that 36 of those restrict smoking in a wide variety of public
places with designated smoking or non-smoking areas. The proposed
Oregon law, she said, would be the first to drop all designated
areas.
   Other groups pitching in to try to defeat the measure are the
Oregon AFL-CIO, Associated Oregon Industries, and the Oregon
Restaurant and Beverage Association.
   The president of the Oregon State Bowling Council, Bob Wells,
said Measure 6 would hurt his industry because a lot of bowlers are
smokers.
   ``If they would not be allowed to smoke for that two-hour
period, they would drop out of the sport altogether or cut down on
the number of times they bowl,'' he said.
   Wells estimated bowling alleys would lose at least 10 percent of
their customers if Measure 6 passes, and argued that the existing
law has been a success in providing separate accommodations for
smokers and non-smokers.
   Odisio said the proposal is part of a nationwide trend.
   ``It's just a case of Oregon being one small step in front of
everybody else,'' she said. ``We're not way out in left field, we
just happen to be at the front of the parade.''
   A poll conducted for The Oregonian newspaper in Portland Sept.
6-7 asked 400 registered voters how they would vote on several
measures that will be on the statewide ballot. Measure 6 was
favored by 62 percent of those surveyed in the telephone poll and
opposed by 36 percent. The rest were undecided.
   The margin of error was 4.9 percent.

<HEAD>Solid, Error-Free Debate Performance Key to Unmaking of Quayle
Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

   Now come the vice presidential nominees in a
different kind of debate _ a confrontation in which Sen. Dan Quayle
will be out to prove that he doesn't deserve to be a campaign issue.
   George Bush's Republican running mate and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, the Democratic candidate for vice president, meet on Oct. 5
in Omaha, Neb., in a 90-minute debate patterned on the match
between the presidential nominees.
   Quayle's competence has come under almost daily challenge from
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, and lately, from
Bentsen.
   The patrician Bentsen has shelved senatorial courtesy in favor
of long-distance attacks on his cross-aisle colleague from Indiana.
And Senate debate etiquette presumably will not apply next week, at
least on Bentsen's side of the stage.
   Quayle, 41, a second-term senator, could try to deflect debate
attacks by using the elaborate courtesies of the Senate in handling
his senior colleague. Debating Dukakis Sunday night, Bush gave a
hint at that strategy by saying that he, Quayle and Bentsen were
the only three candidates in the race who are knowledgeable on
defense issues.
   Campaign debaters customarily are out to raise their profiles,
to promote themselves and their positions as issues to be
considered by the voters.
   But Quayle could best serve his ticket by reversing that with a
solid, error-free debate showing, nothing flashy or fancy, just a
workmanlike performance to try to silence the critics _ and lower
his profile as a Democratic target.
   Vice President Bush, testy when he was questioned about
criticism of his chosen running mate in the presidential debate,
said Quayle, who is 41, is an outstanding young man who has stood
up to ``outrageous, brutal ... very unfair pounding ...'' since his
nomination.
   ``He'll do very, very well'' in the debate, Bush said.
   The Democrats think Quayle is a salable campaign issue for their
side, and Dukakis takes a slap at him in almost every speech. ``I
doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for
that job,'' he said Sunday night. ``And as a matter of fact, I
think for most people, the notion of President Quayle is a very,
very troubling notion.''
   Quayle, campaigning with Bush on Monday in Jackson, Tenn.,
returned the gibe. ``After last night, for most people the notion
of President Dukakis is a very, very troubling notion today,'' he
said.
   With the Democrats questioning his competence, Quayle is in a
position to succeed without really scoring in the vice presidential
debate, if he can hold his own and undercut the opposition claim
that he is in way over his head.
   Quayle can do that by showing the voters that he isn't a dummy,
that he can answer questions under the pressure of a
nationally-televised debate without misspeaking, that he is up to
his assignment.
   The best vice presidential candidates are those who serve as
spokesmen and campaigners for their nominees but don't make waves.
The people running to be No. 2 tend to attract the most attention
when they err, or when their records come under critical scrutiny.
   Both have been happening in Quayle's case, ever since the
question of family influence in his Vietnam-era National Guard
enlistment blew up into controversy just as he was nominated at the
Republican National Convention.
   Four years ago, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro's family income taxes and
her husband's business affairs became a focus of inquiry and thus a
problem for the Democratic ticket on which she ran. In 1976, Sen.
Bob Dole's debate remark that World War I, World War II, Korea and
Vietnam were ``all Democrat wars'' created a troublesome issue for
the Republican ticket.
   Once such questions become issues, they tend to snowball. For
Quayle, the Guard uproar was followed by questions about his
admittedly mediocre college record, and his admission into night
law school.
   Errors in his campaign statements have since been added to the
dossier, things like his tongue-twisted effort to say that a good
defense beats a good offense _ or was it the other way around _ and
his slip in saying that he didn't live in this century.
   Bentsen and Dukakis took it from there.
   Bentsen has called the Republican record on energy ``as empty as
Dan Quayle's resume.''
   Acknowledging that he and Bentsen differ on some issues, Dukakis
said that is healthy.
   ``What would have happened if Ronald Reagan had a vice president
like Lloyd Bentsen; a vice president strong enough to think for
himself and speak up for himself ...?'' he asks his campaign
crowds. ``We haven't had that kind of vice president for the past
eight years, and I don't know of anyone who thinks we'll have him
in the person of J. Danforth Quayle.''
   The name has become a laughter and applause line at Democratic
rallies. Dukakis draws it out slowly, scornfully, and sometimes his
supporters recite it with him.
   In their debate, Bush rebuked Dukakis for ridiculing the name
and said the original J. Danforth was killed in World War II.
   Full name or nickname, Quayle has become a target, and his
problems are taking a Republican toll. Richard Wirthlin, who
conducts public opinion polls for the White House and the
Republican Party, says the Quayle nomination thus far has been more
negative than positive for the ticket, with Bentsen viewed as the
stronger nominee.
   ``The question is to what extent do people vote for the ticket
because of the vice president,'' Wirthlin said. ``In the past, that
has not been a big issue.''
   The Democrats are campaigning to make it one this time.
   Quayle's best opportunity to block them comes next week in Omaha.

   The Ku Klux Klan and the National Park
Service have been negotiating plans for a ``white pride day'' rally
at Independence Hall in November, a park official says.
   The park service expects to approve an application for a permit
to hold the rally at the hall, where the Declaration of
Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed, Chief Ranger
Bob Burn said Monday.
   The application has not been filed yet, but will be soon, said
Richard Fogel, a Klan official who lives in Red Lion, Pa.
   For the past two weeks, the KKK and the park service have been
discussing police protection, parking and other concerns associated
with the rally scheduled for Nov. 5 at the hall, Burn said.
   Burn said the application probably would be approved because
``under the First Amendment and the regulations we operate under,
there's not much room for denying (it).''
   Marie E. Jones, an executive board member of the Philadlephia
branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, agreed the Constitution gives the KKK the right to rally.
   But, she said, ``It is sad to see that people who have accepted
violence as a way of life toward people who are not their race or
creed can imbue others with their hatred.
   ``I do hope there will be some black faces there,'' she said.
   The Klan might invite other right-wing groups, such as the
National Democratic Front and the Natiional States' Rights Party,
Fogel said.
   In May, about 40 people dressed in Klan robes marched in
Parkside, Pa., in suburban Philadelphia. They were greeted by a
crowd of about 1,000 counter-demonstrators.

<HEAD>October Is AIDS Prevention, Awareness Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With more Americans aware of AIDS than ever
before, federal health officials are urging the nation's governors
and clergy to emphasize prevention during October _ AIDS Prevention
and Awareness Month.
   A similar designation was made last October, when a flashy
broadcast, print and direct mail advertising campaign was launched.
   Many of those television spots _ all identified by the phrase
``America Responds to AIDS'' _ still are running and are tied in
with a pamphlet called ``Understanding AIDS'' that was mailed to
every U.S. household last spring.
   ``Despite efforts such as this, we need to keep alerting the
public about AIDS,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R.
Bowen said in a recent letter asking each of the nation's governors
to declare October AIDS Prevention and Education Month.
   A survey issued last month by the Conference Board shows
Americans now consider AIDS to be the most serious problem facing
the United States. In January 1987, AIDS had ranked ninth.
   ``The widespread media attention focused on the AIDS dilemma is
obviously being heard across the country,'' said Fabian Linden,
executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center.
   The survey was conducted for the non-profit, business-supported
group by National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, which polled
5,000 U.S. households.
   ``In a sense the department ... has been successful in making
the public aware about the fact that AIDS is a danger, but
obviously we still have the problem of making sure people are
heeding the prevention aspect of it,'' Public Health Service
spokesman Jim Brown said in a recent interview.
   While 73,394 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS as of Sept.
19, thousands more are known to be in earlier stages of the disease
and the government estimates that up to 1.5 million people in the
United States are infected with the AIDS-causing virus.
   Because of growing data about the disease's long incubation
period, medical experts are increasingly fearful that most, if not
virtually all, of those infected eventually will become sick and
die of AIDS.
   In letters to members of the clergy, distributed through central
offices of the nation's churches and denominations, Bowen and other
top HHS officials asked the religious leaders to set aside the
third weekend of October to ``relay potentially lifesaving messages
about AIDS.''
   ``Such a message could be as simple as urging your congregation
to call the Public Health Service's National AIDS Hotline ... but
we hope you will want to talk to your congregation at greater
length about this topic of such extraordinary importance to us
all,'' said the letter, also signed by Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop and Dr. Robert E. Windom, the assistant HHS secretary for
health.
   Enclosed with the letter were sample questions and answers about
AIDS. Not mentioned in the material sent to priests, rabbis and
ministers was the health service's position that condoms can be a
barrier, although not 100 percent effective, against passing the
infection during sexual contact.
   Another part of this year's more focused October campaign is
letters to university presidents and deans along with a videotape
for college students entitled ``AIDS: Why Should I Care?''
   In a letter to the deans, Windom said one-fifth of the AIDS
cases reported so far ``have occurred among people 20 to 29 years
old.
   ``Since the average incubation period ... is seven years or
longer, it's clear that any of the ... 14,000-plus patients in this
group were high school or college age at the time of their
infection,'' said Windom.
   ``We must leave no stone unturned in teaching students about the
potential risks posed by AIDS and how they can avoid them,'' he
wrote.
   The video includes appearances by such well-known performers as
Dionne Warwick, Chita Rivera, Nell Carter, Mariel Hemingway and
Gary Busey.

   Congressional and administration officials are
close to a Pentagon spending compromise that would remove one of
the last major obstacles to passage of all legislation needed to
pay the government's bills by the Oct. 1 start of a new fiscal year.
   The two sides are near agreement on the complicated Defense
Department measure, according to congressional sources who declined
to be identified Monday.
   The proposed compromise would remove some of the restrictions
imposed earlier by the Democratic-controlled Congress on Reagan's
cherished Star Wars anti-missile defense plan, the sources said.
   But overall, the Strategic Defense Initiative, as the program is
formally known, still would receive $4.1 billion, the same amount
that was in the bill Reagan vetoed on Aug. 3, the sources said.
   Reagan had sought $4.8 billion for Star Wars, compared to the
$3.9 billion the program now receives.
   Approval of a Pentagon bill is the major remaining hurdle to be
cleared before Congress finishes work on all 13 appropriations
bills needed to finance the government starting Saturday.
   The last time all 13 spending bills were finished by the start
of the new fiscal year was 1948.
   House and Senate Democratic leaders are pushing to finish the
bills and avoid giving the GOP and Vice President George Bush a
potentially embarrassing election-year issue.
   After yearlong budget battles, Congress sent the president a
1,400-page, $600 billion catchall spending bill last December,
nearly three months into the present fiscal year.
   In Reagan's State of the Union address, he threatened to veto
any similar giant spending bills this year, and scores of lawmakers
signed letters pledging to support him.
   This year's appropriations work was made easier by the budget
summit agreement between Reagan and congressional leaders last
November.
   That pact settled many broad spending questions for fiscal 1989,
but disputes over various provisions within several individual
bills have caused delays.
   Lawmakers have said the dispute over the defense bill was the
most serious and that its resolution would make it likely that all
13 bills would be finished on time.
   Many Democrats fear that if Congress does not finish its
appropriations work on time this year, the president and
Republicans will use that failure to paint the majority party as
inefficient and incapable of adhering to budget processes.
   Reagan has thus far signed four appropriations bills and two
others have been sent to his desk.
   The Pentagon spending compromise also drops a restriction added
by Congress on testing of depressed-trajectory missiles, a type of
atomic-tipped weapon being developed by the Pentagon, the sources
said.
   The bill provides $300 billion for all Pentagon spending, the
same as the earlier bill. That would be a slight decrease from the
current $302 billion Pentagon budget.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Estranged Husband's Effort To Block Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has let stand Michigan court
rulings that a woman has a constitutional right to end her
pregnancy despite her husband's objections.
   Without comment or recorded dissent, the justices on Monday
denied an emergency request by the estranged husband of Shawn Lewis
of Flint, Mich., that she be prevented from having an abotion.
   In August, Mrs. Lewis told her husband, Carlton, she was seven
or eight weeks pregnant and intended to have an abortion. Lewis
immediately went to court to prevent it.
   Michigan's highest court had rejected the husband's action, but
appointed a guardian for the fetus until 5 p.m. Monday to allow
time to seek emergency help from Justice Antonin Scalia, who
handles emergency appeals from Michigan for the nation's highest
court.
   Scalia referred the request to the full Supreme Court, which
denied it.
   Three other Supreme Court members _ Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and John Paul Stevens _
rejected similar emergency requests to stop abortions earlier this
year.
   Lewis' attorney, Steven Moss, said the husband was upset by the
verdict.
   ``That's his baby and he wants it,'' Moss said.
   Mrs. Lewis was ``happy and relieved,'' said attorney Shelley
Spivack. She did not know when the 24-year-old woman would have the
planned abortion. Mrs. Lewis has refused to discuss the case.
   James Bopp Jr. of Terre Haute, Ind., the lawyer who had filed an
emergency appeal on behalf of the fetus, said he planned to file a
further appeal by the end of the week.
   ``I'm hoping that they'll hear it on merits,'' said Bopp. ``They
didn't decide the case on merits. They just denied the stay. We
lost part, but we didn't lose all.''
   Bopp had asked that Mrs. Lewis be kept from having an abortion
until the full Supreme Court considers a formal appeal.
   In the appeal, Bopp urged the court to overturn its landmark
1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   ``We're very pleased for Shawn Lewis,'' said Howard Simon,
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Michigan
chapter. ``Our job was to protect her right to choose, whether that
choice is to carry that pregnancy to term or terminate her
pregnancy.''
   If the situation were reversed and a woman wanted to carry a
pregnancy to term against her husband's wishes, the case never
would have gone all the way to the highest court in the land, he
said.
   ``Nobody would have thought he had a right to force her to have
an abortion if she didn't want one,'' he said. ``The consistent
principle is respect for each person's dignity.''
   Mrs. Lewis filed for divorce last January. The couple had a
brief reconciliation but have said they want to continue divorce
proceedings.
   A Genesee County trial judge barred Mrs. Lewis from having an
abortion, but a state appeals court threw out the judge's order.
The Michigan Supreme Court last Thursday said it was not
``persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this
court.''
   The cases are Meyers vs. Lewis, A-240, and Lewis vs. Lewis,
A-244.

   A bill that Vice President George Bush says is
a good way to help the homeless is drawing flak from the Reagan
administration, which argues that some of its provisions are
duplicative and ineffective.
   In a statement distributed Monday, the administration's Office
of Management and Budget said that portions of the so-called
McKinney bill ``duplicate existing programs'' and are so complex
that they ``do not effectively address the needs of this
population.''
   In his debate Sunday with Democratic rival Michael Dukakis,
Republican presidential nominee Bush said that to help the nation's
homeless people, the government should ``fully fund the McKinney
Act.''
   The legislation was initially signed into law on July 22, 1987,
after President Reagan railed about the measure's expense and
``duplicative programs.''
   The law created programs worth $1.1 billion over the last two
years for housing, health care, education, job training and other
help for the nation's homeless people. Legislation authorizing $1.3
billion worth of expenditures for the next two years is working its
way through Congress.
   In its statement, OMB said it favored the bill's programs for
emergency food and shelter and for transitional housing.
   But the agency said the administration opposes parts of the bill
which would give bonuses to states that place welfare recipients in
jobs, would eliminate some rental assistance, and would pay
salaries for state workers who coordinate homeless activities.
   The statement did not, however, contain any threat to veto the
bill.
   When the original version of the legislation passed the House on
a 264-121 vote on March 5, 1987, all but eight of the votes cast
against it were by Republicans. GOP lawmakers argued that the
easure would increase the federal deficit, and was so generous that
it might worsen the problem by encouraging even more people to live
in the streets.
   Passage came two nights after a highly publicized ``Grate
American Sleep-Out,'' in which several members of Congress joined
homeless advocate Mitch Snyder and actor Martin Sheen for an
evening sleeping on a grate two blocks from the Capitol.
   The Senate passed a less expensive version of the bill on a
voice vote a month later.
   Housing advocates have been disappointed with the results of the
legislation. The Reagan administration has consistently sought _
and Congress has provided _ actual spending levels far below the
amounts permitted in the bill. For the first two years of the law,
for example, Congress appropriated only $700 million out of a
possible $1.1 billion.
   The money provided under the legislation was largely distributed
to non-profit agencies and to state and local governments. It has
been used to provide emergency food and shelter, to purchase and
rehabilitate group homes, to pay for health and education programs,
to help tenants pay rent, and for other projects.
   The measure was named after the late Rep. Stewart B. McKinney,
R-Conn., one of the legislation's original sponsors. McKinney died
May 7, 1987.
   Estimates of the number of homeless in the country range between
250,000 to 3 million people.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the latest auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.23 percent on Monday, up from 7.17
percent last week. Another $7.0 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.48 percent, up from 7.34 percent
last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.26
percent on Sept. 6 and six-month bills averaged 7.50 percent on
Aug. 29.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.47 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,817.20 and 7.88 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,621.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 8.07
percent last week after averaging 8.01 percent the week before.

   China and Iran have signed an agreement on
setting up general consulates in their two countries to help boost
economic and trade relations.
   Iran will open a consulate in Shanghai under Monday's pact,
while China reserves the right to open a consulate in an as yet
undecided Iranian city, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   China, which has maintained good relations with both Iran and
Iraq and was alleged to be a major arms supplier in the Persian
Gulf war, has welcomed the cease-fire in the war as an opportunity
to boost trade ties with both countries.
   Earlier this month, China sent a large delegation to an
international trade fair in Tehran that reportedly was promoting
sales of optical, chemical and light industrial products and
petroleum engineering technologies and equipment.
   China is also seeking to export labor for major construction
projects.

   Those great pop songs of the early 1960s will
survive ``Suds,'' a numbing regurgitation of many of the musical
hits of the era when the Beatles were changing the sound of popular
music.
   There are some terrific musical memories including ``Respect,''
``Dedicated to the One I Love,'' ``The Loco-Motion,'' ``Do Wah
Diddy Diddy,'' ``You Don`t Have to Say You Love Me,'' ``You Can't
Hurry Love'' and nearly 40 other Top 10 tunes crammed into the show.
   What sinks ``Suds'' is not the songs but the dippy story that
authors Melinda Gilb, Steve Gunderson and Bryan Scott have
inflicted on these golden oldies. It's dumb without being fun.
   They have set their musical in a Laundromat where Cindy, the
world's oldest looking teen-ager, is celebrating her birthday _
alone and depressed. Cindy's cat, Fluffy, has been run over by a
Corvair, her pen pal boyfriend has dropped her because he found
someone with better handwriting and she discovers she owes $10,000
to the Internal Revenue Service for some relative's back taxes.
   Cindy tries to end it all by wrapping pedal pushers around her
neck, throwing them into a Maytag and agitating herself to death.
She's stopped by two guardian angels, one named Dee Dee who looks
like Marlo Thomas on a bad day and the other, Marge, whose red
bouffant hairdo confirms she has cornered the market on hairspray.
   The duo counsel the girl, trying to cheer her up and persuade
her to get on with her life. It's these therapeutic sessions that
take the form of musical interludes, usually three or four hit
numbers stitched together. Occasionally, they take off, like a
funny version of ``Secret Agent Man,'' done with style by
Gunderson, who plays all the men and even one woman in the show.
   More often, you grow impatient with the dialogue, waiting for
the story to end and the music to begin again. The cast is
competent but not distinguished. The women _ Christine Sevec, Susan
Mosher and Gilb _ belt out the songs with gusto if not any
particular style.
   ``Suds,'' which opened last weekend, is the first attraction at
Stage Left, a cabaret theater in the Criterion Center. The Center
is an impressive theater complex located in Times Square and also
contains a more formal theater which will open later in the year.
The playing area has good sightlines and comfortable seating. Now
all it needs is a show.

<TEXT>
   Things have turned nasty in New York's U.S.
Senate race where Democratic incumbent Daniel Patrick Moynihan's
GOP opponent already has called his rival a liar, a coward and a
crummy boss.
   Moynihan, a two-term Senate veteran, is known to most of the
world as a professorial type who writes a lot of books, taught at
Harvard and served as U.S. ambassador to India and the United
Nations.
   But Republican Robert McMillan is hoping to expose another side
of Moynihan using an aggressive campaign with sharp personal
attacks, and, in the process, salvage an underfunded and
underpublicized effort to unseat Moynihan.
   It's a long shot gamble.
   Moynihan, McMillan claims, is an arrogant and overrated senator
who was ``chicken'' to debate him, condones ``safe sodomy'' for
homosexuals, lies to the press, is too abrasive to keep employees
on his staff and too lazy to do his official duties in Washington.
   ``What kind of a man is this Pat Moynihan?'' McMillan asked last
month. ``He's on the record as one who would lie, if he thought he
could get away with it.''
   Moynihan, 61, has tried to appear above the fray in the face of
McMillan's charges.
   When asked about being called a liar, Moynihan said only, ``I
heard that. That's OK. I've been called worse things than that.''
   McMillan, 56, a wealthy Long Island lawyer who worked for
President Nixon in the 1960s, also maintains that Moynihan hasn't
been the kind of ``shining beacon'' to the youth of New York that
McMillan recalls from his adolescent days in front of the radio. He
suggested Flash Gordon, the Lone Ranger, Captain Midnight or Jack
Armstrong as good role models.
   Many attribute the tone of McMillan's campaign to one of its
chief strategists, Robert Blasdell, who once worked with campaign
expert Roger Ailes. An influential voice in Republican nominee
George Bush's presidential effort, Ailes is known for his
bare-knuckles campaign style.
   McMillan's attacks haven't had a discernible effect among
voters, but they have prompted Moynihan campaign aide Lawrence
O'Donnell Jr. to suggest that New Yorkers might be owed an apology
``for the nonsense they've been subjected to by this candidacy.''
   ``This is what comes from desperation,'' O'Donnell said of
McMillan's tactics. ``There's a very cold, calculated decision
being made to go after Pat Moynihan the person. And that, you'll
find in a state where Moynihan has a 70 percent approval rating, is
the most egregious tactical mistake the opposition campaign could
ever have.''
   Moynihan won 65 percent of the vote en route to his defeat of
little-known Brooklyn state Assemblywoman Florence Sullivan in 1982
by more than 1.5 million votes. A poll conducted earlier this month
by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie,
N.Y., showed him with a 63-21 percent lead over McMillan among 601
likely voters.
   Financially, McMillan has little hope of matching Moynihan in
spending. The most recent contribution filing with the Federal
Election Commission showed McMillan's campaign $40,000 in debt
while Moynihan had $1.9 million in the bank.
   Since starting his campaign May 9, McMillan has been on the road
almost constantly, appearing at county fairs, political picnics and
local television and radio stations. He has logged about 27,000
miles by car.
   In that time, the GOP candidate has tried to prove that
Moynihan's intellectual bent hasn't paid dividends for New Yorkers
since the former Harvard professor won election to the Senate in
1976.
   McMillan says Moynihan has exercised ``benign neglect'' toward
New Yorkers as senator. Moynihan says ``I plead guilty'' about his
enthusiasm for writing and lecturing, but insists that one of his
senatorial duties is to articulate the issues.
   And, O'Donnell says Moynihan has been responsible for delivering
about $5 billion in federal aid to New York in his second term
alone.
   McMillan has also tried to make political hay by pointing out
that Moynihan has missed more than 400 roll call votes since
arriving in the Senate. But Moynihan says that when first elected,
he promised only to do better than the senatorial average as far as
attendance in the House was concerned. He said he's done that by
being present for about 92 percent of the votes.
   McMillan leveled the liar charge in connection with an incident
last year when a Buffalo (N.Y.) News reporter challenged Moynihan
on why he had been excluded from a Moynihan press briefing.
Moynihan denied that he'd ordered the reporter barred, but Moynihan
chief of staff Harrison Rainie said his boss had indeed given
orders to keep the reporter out.
   Rainie, a former New York Daily News reporter, resigned a few
days later.
   ``One day of staff confusion,'' said O'Donnell of the incident.

<HEAD>$206 Million Farm Research Bill Gets House Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agricultural research bill to provide $206
million for programs ranging from alternative crops to fish farming
is headed for the Senate after winning approval in the House.
   ``The land is the only thing that can produce new wealth for
this vast economic empire we call the United States of America and
it begins with research,'' Agriculture Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la
Garza, D-Texas, said Monday as the bill received House approval on
a voice vote.
   Research grants to develop new types of crop production would be
authorized by the bill. The measure also would establish a National
Institute for Alternative Agricultural Products within the
Agriculture Department.
   A non-profit Agricultural Research Commercialization Corp. also
would be created that would use loans, loan guarantees, interest
subsidies and other means to spur product commercialization.
   Under the measure, $20 million a year through fiscal year 2000
would be authorized for development of new agricultural products,
$15 million to commercialize products and up to $600,000 to enhance
marketing of existing ones.
   The bill's overall price tag was estimated by the Congressional
Budget Office at $206 million over five years.
   With perhaps three weeks to go before lawmakers adjourn,
however, the future of the measure is clouded. The Senate has
offered no guarantees that it will get to the measure.
   The bill would establish grants for research into statistical
methods of measuring chemicals and microorganisms in food products
and means of preventing contamination.
   Also under the measure, an office of groundwater policy
determination would be established within the Agriculture
Department. That provision was included at the urging of Republican
Rep. Fred Grandy of Iowa, where concern is growing over findings of
pesticide contamination in groundwater.
   The bill would provide $3 million in each of three years for
research into aquaculture, or fish farming.
   It also would reauthorize federal research aid for examination
and development of crops used in so-called critical materials. The
measure would set the program at an $8 million level for each of
the next two years.
   Most money under that program would go to research into guayule
_ a plant grown in the Southwest that produces a natural rubber
that can be used for high-performance aircraft tires.
   The bill would enable farmers to plant so-called alternative
crops in 1989 and 1990 without losing their base acreage listed
with the Department of Agriculture. The base acreage is used to
calculate the size of the federal payments they get for producing
wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice.
   Meanwhile, the House approved on a voice vote a separate measure
to establish a 25-member Commission on the Improvement of the
Federal Crop Insurance Program.
   Ten of the 21 voting members would come from the insurance
industry and 10 from among agricultural producers with the manager
of the corporation also serving on the panel. The four non-voting
members would come from Congress.
   The goal of the panel would be to recommend changes in the
program, which has lost more than $1 billion since 1980 when a
major overhaul was approved.

<HEAD>Townspeople Worry About Fate of Tree That May Have Inspired Kilmer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTAGUE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents are concerned about a rock
maple tree that provided a shady spot for poet Joyce Kilmer, who
may have been inspired by it when he wrote ``I think that I shall
never see a poem as lovely as a tree.''
   The hospital on whose grounds the tree sits has announced it is
closing after 88 years.
   ``It would be too bad if something happened to that tree, but
you never know with the hospital going and all,'' said Sister Mary
Rosalie Morrison of the Sisters of Providence order, which owns
Farren Memorial Hospital.
   Local historians say the grand old maple inspired the Kilmer
poem memorized by millions of schoolchildren on Arbor Days past.
   Other communities have made the same claim, but Montague offers
as proof the many visits the young Kilmer paid to the village of
Montague City to stay with his friend and spiritual adviser, the
Rev. Edmund D. Casey, a Roman Catholic priest and chaplain at the
hospital from 1910 to 1937.
   Town lore has it that Kilmer visited around 1910 and sought
shade beneath the huge tree eight years before he was killed in
France in World War I at age 32.
   The poet is said to have stayed in a large house on the north
side of the hospital, according to Arthur Paulin, retired director
of engineering, who worked at the hospital for 55 years. The house
burned down in the 1940s.

   The number of working Americans with wages
below the poverty level for a family of four increased by more than
1 million last year, according to a new Senate report.
   The report, prepared by the Democratic staff of the Senate
Budget Committee from Census Bureau data, concluded that both
high-paying and low-paying jobs have grown at the expense of a
shrinking middle class over the past eight years.
   Fueling the debate over the quality of 16 million new jobs since
President Reagan took office, the report was immediately criticized
by Senate Republicans as ``misleading and inaccurate.''
   ``Sixty-four percent of American jobs paid middle level wages
(defined as those between $11,611 and $46,444 in 1987 dollars) in
1979,'' said the report, released Monday.
   ``Between the peak of the business cycle in 1979 and the latest
year of the current expansion in 1987, only 38 percent of the
increase in employment was in middle wage jobs,'' it added.
   As a result, according to the data, the share of middle-wage
earners declined from 64 percent to 61.3 percent between 1979 and
1987. Those earning a poverty wage climbed from 32.4 percent to
34.2 percent and those with high wages (more than $46,444) rose
from 3.7 percent to 4.5 percent of the working population.
   The committee's chairman, retiring Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.,
said a comparison of the 1987 data from the Census Bureau's Current
Population Survey released earlier this month with 1986 data shows
a worsening of the trend.
   According to the data, 40.45 million workers were paid a
full-time equivalent of less than $11,611 last year, compared with
39.38 million in 1986. Meanwhile, the number of Americans with jobs
exceeding $46,444 fell from 5.4 million in 1986 to 5.32 million
last year.
   ``The sad truth,'' Chiles said, ``is that jobs paying below the
poverty level are growing faster than any other kind. And jobs that
provide a middle-class standard of living are a shrinking part of
our job landscape.''
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the committee's ranking
Republican and former chairman, called the report ``opportunistic,
political, misleading and inaccurate'' and predicted that it
eventually will be discredited.
   ``Most of the new jobs created during the expansion have been in
occupations that pay well _ in technical and managerial fields, the
kind of jobs we want for our kids,'' he said. ``Only 8 percent of
the jobs generated by this expansion pay under $7,000 annually.''
   The only group going against the trend was women, according to
the report. Middle-wage and high-wage jobs among them increased by
1.2 percentage points and 0.5 percentage points to 55.4 percent and
1.8 percent, respectively, over the past eight years.
   The share of women in the workforce with low-paying jobs,
meanwhile, fell from 44.6 percent in 1979 to 42.9 percent last year.
   Men fared the worst, with the middle-income share falling from
72.1 percent in 1979 to 66.6 percent last year. The share of
low-wage earners among men climbed from 22.3 percent to 26.5
percent over the same period while the proportion of high-wage
earners rose from 5.6 percent to 6.9 percent.
   Among blacks and other minorities, the share of low-income
workers and high-income earners increased by 1.2 percentage points
and 0.6 percentage points to 41.7 percent and 2.3 percent
respectively. The proportion of middle-income minority workers
declined from 57.8 percent to 56 percent over the eight years.

<HEAD>TV Ads To Feature Closing Statement, Health Care Pitch From Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis has already turned his closing
statement from the first presidential debate into a tag line for
two campaign commercials that begin airing tonight.
   ``The best America is not behind us, the best America is yet to
come,'' Dukakis says in both 30-second spots.
   One, called ``Opportunity,'' includes only the closing lines
from his Sunday night debate with George Bush at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   The other, ``Our Concern,'' focuses on his pitch for universal
health insurance, but also mentions college opportunity and
includes the closing line.
   The length of the run has not been determined, Dukakis
spokeswoman Lorraine Voles said Monday.
   ``We have an opportunity, working together, to build that
future, to build a better America, to build a best America,''
Dukakis said at the close of the debate in a passage also
frequently found in his stump speeches.
   ``Because the best America doesn't hide; we compete,'' he
continued. ``The best America doesn't waste; we invest. The best
America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind; we bring
everyone along. And the best America is not behind us. The best
America is yet to come.''
   The health care pitch focuses on the Democratic nominee's
promise to seek legislation requiring most employers to provide
health insurance to their workers.
   ``I think it's time that when you got a job in this country that
it came with health insurance,'' Dukakis says in the debate footage.
   The passage from the closing statement was chosen for an ad
because it focuses on Dukakis' effort to win broad support among
middle class voters _ a segment Dukakis has characterized as
victims of the Reagan recovery.
   Dukakis aides had planned to use at least one segment from the
debate, and likely the closing statement, for a new ad and then
also decided to make a second ad with the health care material,
campaign aides said.

<TEXT>
   Food aid to needy countries has dropped and
could fall further because of rising commodity prices, according to
Agriculture Department analysts.
   The Food and Agriculture Organization, a United Nations agency,
estimates that aid in the form of cereal grain shipments in the 12
months ended June 30 was about 10.5 million metric tons, down 14
percent from 12.2 million tons a year earlier.
   Ray Nightingale of the Agriculture Department's Economic
Research Service said the United States provided 65 percent of last
year's 10.5 million tons and ``was followed distantly'' by the
European Economic Community with 15 percent; Canada, 10 percent;
and Japan and Australia, each with about 3 percent.
   For the fourth consecutive year, he said, the 1974 World Food
Conference goal of 10 million tons of food aid was exceeded last
year.
   ``However, given no significant increases in the major donors'
1988-89 food-aid budgets, and higher commodity prices, the volume
of food aid may fall in 1988-89, and achievement of the
10-million-ton-goal is doubtful,'' Nightingale said.
   The U.S. aid program under Food for Peace, or P.L. 480 as it is
also known, was increased nearly 5 percent for the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30 to nearly $1.5 billion.
   Nightingale, writing in the October issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine, said about two-thirds of the volume under Food
for Peace was wheat and wheat products, while feed grains and
vegetable oils made up about 5 percent each. Rice, dairy products,
pulses and other products made up the remainder.
   Africa accounted for nearly half the U.S. allocations in
1987-88; Asia, about a third, and Latin America, about a fifth.
   Nightingale said the dollar amount of the 1988-89 allocations
under Food for Peace has not been decided but that the Reagan
administration has requested about $1.4 billion, which effectively
would roll back the 5 percent increase of 1987-88.
   The 1988-89 money for Food for Peace is included in USDA
appropriation bills currently being negotiated by a House and
Senate conference committee.
   Nightingale said that with few exceptions crop prospects in
developing countries ``look good this season'' and that food
supplies are up relative to current consumption.
   ``However, greater assistance is needed this year to rebuild
stocks that were drawn down heavily last year,'' he said.
   Grains are the mainstay of food aid, with cereals making up 75
percent of the diet in Asia and 50 percent to 70 percent in Africa,
Nightingale said. Although these regions produce a large share of
the world's cereal crops, much that enters world trade is grown in
North America, where drought has reduced supplies this year.
   The USDA monitors 55 countries for signs of food shortfall.
Newly available information on the food-aid share of some
countries' food imports ``indicates greater dependence on aid than
previously thought,'' Nightingale said.
   Some countries have allocated less foreign exchange to food
imports than thought earlier, he said. And because prices are up,
the estimated amount of commercial imports will be only 6.5 million
tons, compared with 11.7 million in 1987-88.

   The Agriculture Department says three food
stamp projects using plastic magnetic strip cards instead of paper
coupons will be conducted in parts of Arizona, New Mexico and
Minnesota.
   Assistant Secretary John W. Bode said Monday that nearly 30,000
food stamp households in the three states will use the cards to see
if the system will be easier for people to use and to help reduce
lost or stolen coupons.
   The projects are scheduled to begin within the next 8 to 12
months and run for at least three years, he said. An evaluation
will be made to see if the electronic system might be used
nationally.
   Bode said the $1.3 million project will operate by running the
plastic cards through a computer terminal at grocery checkout
counters. The cost of the food will be automatically deducted from
the family's total monthly food stamp allotment.
   In addition, he said, some of the food stamp recipients will be
able to use the same plastic cards for other public benefits, such
as Aid for Families With Dependent Children.
   Bode said Arizona will get $580,853 from USDA to design its
projects, which will be tested in Mesa, with services to 6,500
households.
   Minnesota will receive $385,309 to test kits system in Ramsey
County among 13,000 households, and New Mexico will get $379 for
its test in Albuquerque among 10,150 households.
   Nationally, nearly 19 million people are getting food stamp
benefits, based on family size and adjusted household incomes. The
program costs about $12.6 billion a year.

   Some penjing trees from China are out of
federal quarantine and will be dedicated at the U.S. National
Arboretum on Sept. 30, says the Agriculture Department.
   Penjing trees are dwarf versions of forest species and are the
result of a 1,200-year-old art, says arboretum director H. Marc
Cathey. The specimens, a gift to the American people, are 20 to 100
years old and are only three feet high.
   Cathey said Monday that the penjing trees will be dedicated and
opened to public display on Sept. 30.
   The trees were donated by penjing experts Wu Yee-sun and Lui
Shu-ying on June 25, 1986, in Hong Kong. All specimens have been
held in quarantine at the department's Agricultural Research
Service plant introduction station in Glenn Dale, Md., to guard
against the introduction of pests and diseases.

   Luciano Pavarotti's singing was ravishing and
his co-stars were in sterling voice for the Metropolitan Opera's
opening night performance of ``Il Trovatore'' Monday, but the
production lacked excitement, at times resembling a concert more
than an opera.
   The staging of the Fabrizio Melano production, which was new
last November, works against excitement. The set is a high
staircase extending across the stage. Most of the time, the singers
take turns standing alone on the stairs. The stage is kept dark,
with a changing backdrop of dark and white clouds.
   Of the three stars, Sherrill Milnes took vocal honors in the
first two acts, his voice strong and warm from the first note,
while Pavarotti and Eva Marton held back for the last two acts.
   Pavarotti, as Manrico, was tender with the Leonora, sung by Eva
Marton, and with Azucena, sung by Fiorenza Cossotto. When there was
reason for Manrico to be firm, Pavarotti's tones became stalwart.
He also acted effectively, using spare but telling gestures.
   In 1976, Pavarotti sang at the Met's opening night in this same
opera. It was his first Met venture into heavier roles than the
light, clear bel canto parts he had been singing. One heard strain
in his voice as he repeatedly sang Manrico that season. Now, the
role sounds natural and totally unstrained.
   Miss Marton was singing Leonora at the Met for the first time.
Her voice is closer to being shrill than soft and sweet, but she
has the volume, flexibility and stamina for the part. The last-act
duet with Milnes was excitingly sung by both. And her ``D'amor
sull'ali rosee'' was affecting.
   Miss Cossotto, who made her Met debut 20 years ago, began with a
hard vibrato but she dug into the part of Azucena with artistry.
   Bass Jeffrey Wells, a native of Baton Rouge, La., made his Met
debut singing virtually the entire first scene. Wells, who has sung
the captain of the guards in this opera with the Washington Opera
and Canadian Opera, was self-possessed and sounded splendid.
   James Levine conducted.
   First lady Nancy Reagan attended the opening, seated in one of
the center boxes. Also in the audience were United Kingdom
Ambassador and Mrs. Antony Acland, Italian Ambassador and Mrs.
Rinaldo Petrignani, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Kissinger, Oscar de la Renta
and Rudolf Nureyev.
   The top-price tickets, $1,000, included a post-opera party.

   ``Dead Ringers,'' a disturbing psychological
thriller about twin gynecologists, opened in the No. 1 spot at the
nation's box offices over the weekend while the rest of the field
was dominated by summer holdovers.
   Directed by David Cronenberg and starring Jeremy Irons in the
dual role as brothers Beverly and Elliot Mantle, ``Dead Ringers''
collected $3 million, according to figures released Monday by
Exhibitor Relations Co.
   Two Disney films re-emerged among the box-office leaders, as
``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' moved to fourth with receipts of $1.7
million and ``Cocktail'' advanced to fifth with revenues of $1.64
million.
   The country's box office proceeds continued to be sluggish, with
only three movies netting more than $2 million. Six films passed
the $2 million mark last weekend, and even that was considered
disappointing.
   ``Die Hard,'' the Bruce Willis action film, finished at No. 2
with $2.5 million worth of tickets sold.
   Former box-office champion ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' a comedy
featuring Jamie Lee Curtis and John Cleese, fell to No. 3, with
$2.2 million.
   ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 4'' came in sixth with $1.62
million, followed by ``Young Guns'' in seventh with $1.5 million.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Moon Over Parador'' in eighth
with $1.5 million, ``Betrayed'' in ninth with $1.4 million and the
new film ``Kansas,'' starring Matt Dillon, in tenth with $1.3
million.
   Two heavily promoted new movies _ ``Gorillas in the Mist'' and
``Patty Hearst'' _ generated dramatically different business.
   Playing on just 15 screens, ``Gorillas'' drew $367,000, or
$24,462 per screen. ``Patty Hearst,'' on the other hand, averaged
only $1,300 per screen at 460 theaters nationwide.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Dead Ringers,'' 20th Century Fox, $3 million, 1,042
screens, $2,891 per screen, $3 million, one week.
   2. ``Die Hard,'' 20th Century Fox, $2.5 million, 1,282 screens,
$1,909 per screen, $68.2 million, 11 weeks.
   3. ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' MGM, $2.2 million, 1,164 screens,
$1,895 per screen, $48.3 million, 11 weeks.
   4. ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' Disney, $1.7 million, 1,321
screens, $1,280 per screen, $138.2 million, 14 weeks.
   5. ``Cocktail,'' Disney, $1.64 million, 1,276 screens, $1,287
per screen, $65.4 million, nine weeks.
   6. ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 4,'' New Line, $1.62 million,
1,207 screens, $1,339 per screen, $43.6 million, six weeks.
   7. ``Young Guns,'' 20th Century Fox, $1.5 million, 1,295
screens, $1,168 per screen, $36.9 million, seven weeks.
   8. ``Moon Over Parador,'' Universal, $1.5 million, 1,058
screens, $1,390 per screen, $8.8 million, three weeks.
   9. ``Betrayed,'' United Artists, $1.4 million, 1,066 screens,
$1,305 per screen, $21.7 million, five weeks.
   10. ``Kansas,'' Trans World, $1.3 million, 847 screens, $1,505
per screen, $1.3 million, one week.

<HEAD>Reagan Expected To Sign Bill On Endangered Species Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is expected to sign
legislation to boost spending on protection of endangered species,
with a special focus on efforts to pressure ivory-producing African
nations to crack down on elephant poaching.
   ``We have no major objections to the bill,'' Barbara Clay,
spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget,
said Monday after the House completed congressional action on a
renewal of the Endangered Species Act.
   The 15-year-old law, a world model for preserving plants,
animals and fish from extinction, prohibits trade in endangered or
threatened species and requires the government to take affirmative
steps to save them and avoid actions that would hurt them.
   In separate action Monday, the House sent the Senate a bill to
reauthorize the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act and initiate a
U.S. program to curb the mounting losses of dolphins to yellowfin
tuna fishermen in the Pacific.
   The passage of the Endangered Species Act renewal capped four
years of struggle by congressional environmentalists to strengthen
the basic law and raise the amount that can be spent on the
protection program.
   The legislation, worked out by House and Senate negotiators,
would authorize, subject to the appropriations process, the
spending of $56 million next year, rising to $66 million in 1992.
The current level is about $39 million.
   The bill contains a new program that would provide money to
states that enter into cooperative agreements to assist in
preserving endangered or threatened species. States could share $15
million next year, going up to $18 million in 1992.
   The legislation also would authorize U.S. spending of $25
million through 1993 in an effort to halt population declines among
African elephants, whose numbers reportedly have dropped to 700,000
from 1.5 million in 1979.
   The Interior Department would be required to review
elephant-conservation programs of Africa's ivory-producing nations
and bar imports of ivory from countries whose programs are deemed
ineffective to halt elephant poaching.
   The bill would bar raw ivory imports from any nation without a
native elephant population and would require U.S. ivory importers
and exporters to obtain licenses from the department.
   Curtis Bohlen, a vice president of the World Wildlife
Federation, said the U.S. action should ``put teeth'' into
international efforts to halt the illegal hunting of elephants.
   ``It's not going to happen overnight, but it's a good step
forward,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   A violation of the elephant protection provisions could bring a
maximum civil penalty of $5,000 and a top criminal penalty of a
$200,000 fine and a year in prison. Maximum fines for violating the
basic Endangered Species Act would also be boosted, from $20,000 to
$50,000.
   There currently are nearly 1,000 species on the
endangered-threatened list, about 400 of them native to the United
States.
   The bill would require the Interior Department to step up
efforts to monitor the condition of species proposed for addition
to the list. Environmentalists say about 80 species have become
extinct while awaiting formal protection.
   The way for passage of the legislation was cleared after a
compromise was reached over a Reagan administration plan to require
shrimp harvesters to use excluder devices to prevent sea turtles
from drowning in their nets.
   The bill would delay mandatory use of the devices in offshore
waters until May 1, 1989 and in inshore waters until a year later.
In the interim, the National Academy of Sciences would study the
viability of sea turtle populations.
   Under the marine mammal bill, the Commerce Department would be
able to ban tuna imports from nations that fail to take steps to
reduce the drowning deaths of dolphins in tuna nets to rates
comparable to the U.S. Pacific tuna fleet.
   Dolphins are at risk because schools of yellowfin tuna are
frequently found swimming beneath dolphins in the eastern Pacific.
Congressional committees have been told that 115,000 dolphins died
in foreign nets last year, compared to less than 14,000 in U.S.
nets.
   The bill also would require a study of the effects on dolphins
of so-called seal bombs used by commercial yellowfin tuna boats and
a study of the high death rates of the Atlantic bottlenosed dolphin
off the East Coast in 1987 and 1988.

   Rock singer Pat Benatar will resume her
national tour Saturday in Atlanta after undergoing emergency
abdominal surgery, her publicist says.
   ``After experiencing severe abdominal pain ... Benatar was taken
to Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital, where she underwent emergency
abdominal surgery'' on Friday, publicist Jocelynn Loebl said Monday.
   Loebl said she didn't know the nature of the ailment, but added
that it wasn't appendicitis as had been reported.
   Benatar was in the Detroit area for a performance at the Pine
Knob Music Center when she became ill Friday, Loebl said.
   Benatar, 35, and her family are staying with relatives while she
rests, Loebl said. ``She's with her husband, Neil (Geraldo), and
her baby,'' Loebl said.
   Benatar, whose nationwide tour coincides with release of her
album, ``Wide Awake in Dreamland,'' will reschedule appearances she
missed in Detroit, Chicago, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, Loebl
said.

   French actor-singer Yves Montand arrived
in this military-ruled country to work for the restoration of
democracy.
   ``I had to come here to support the efforts to restore democracy
in this country,'' Montand told reporters at the airport on his
arrival from Paris.
   Montand starred in ``Z'' by director Costa-Gavras, whose films
usually have a highly political tone. Another Costa-Gavras film was
``Missing,'' about dictatorship in Chile.
   Montand said he is interested in seeing the Chilean situation
before the Oct. 5 referendum, in which President and military
commander Augusto Pinochet, who has ruled since 1973, seeks
re-election for another eight years.
   He was invited to Chile by two local social research
institutions.
   During his five-day visit to Chile, Montand was scheduled to
visit the independent Human Rights Commission and La Victoria, a
slum noted for its militant opposition to the military regime.

   The wrangling continues among Henry
Ford II's widow, Kathleen DuRoss Ford, the late auto magnate's son,
Edsel Ford II, other family members, and trustee William Donaldson.
   A last-minute settlement in the feud over the $350 million trust
left by Henry Ford II broke down in court Monday.
   Mrs. Ford had complained that Donaldson, an ally of Edsel Ford,
was demanding a $1 million-a-year salary to administer the trust,
and that he had threatened to cut her income to the minimum level
of $1.5 million.
   Fourteen attorneys for both sides hammered out a compromise
early Monday. But a question over whether a legal guardian should
be appointed for Ford's minor grandchildren created a furor, and
the whole settlement collapsed.
   Ford, who died last year, took control of Ford Motor Co. in 1945
from his grandfather, auto pioneer Henry Ford.
   He named Mrs. Ford as sole beneficiary of his trust, but
stipulated that upon her death his six grandchildren would become
the beneficiaries.
   He named three people to manage the trust _ Mrs. Ford, Edsel
Ford and family friend Martin Citrin. In April, Citrin killed
himself. Ford's choice for an alternate trustee was Donaldson.

   Forget Park Place or Boardwalk, commissar.
Red Square beckons.
   Parker Brothers, makers of Monopoly, announced Monday that the
Soviet people may soon have the opportunity to pass Go, collect 200
rubles and conduct wild real estate deals.
   The manufacturer of the best-selling game said it has created a
Russian-language version of the game, using the Cyrillic alphabet.
   The company said it anticipates great interest once the game is
offered for sale in the Soviet Union, as the popularity of
Western-style toys and games increases in an era of glasnost, or
openness.
   ``We hope this venture will result in fun cultural exchanges and
goodwill that may lead to better mutual understanding between the
American and the Soviet people,'' said Ronald D. Leong, Parker
Brothers' vice president for marketing.
   Parker Brothers intends to unveil the newest version of Monopoly
in mid-October. More than 100 million copies of the game have been
sold worldwide since it was first marketed 53 years ago.

<HEAD>Judges Suggest Eastern Layoff Decision Was Not Anti-Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' decision to lay off 4,000
workers apparently was a normal business move, not an anti-union
tactic, two federal appeals judges have suggested.
   At a hearing Monday on a lower court's ruling that the layoffs
are illegal, Circuit Judges James L. Buckley and Stephen Williams
challenged arguments by union lawyers that the airline was trying
to weaken organized labor at the bargaining table.
   James Linsey, representing the Air Line Pilots Association, said
the layoffs were inconsistent with past Eastern practices. He said
they also violated Railway Labor Act requirements to preserve the
status quo during labor negotiations.
   ``There certainly is past practice to cut unprofitable routes,''
said Williams.
   ``There is no history of dramatic downsizing,'' Linsey said,
referring to Eastern's closing of its Kansas City hub and the
elimination of service to 14 cities.
   But Williams said figures showed that Eastern had made other
large cuts in its work force since 1980.
   Last month, U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker ruled that the
layoffs were subject to negotiation with its unions under the
Railway Labor Act. Parker granted the injunction sought by the
pilots union, the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers and the Transport Workers Union of America.
   But Parker ruled that Eastern could proceed with its plan to
stop service in 14 cities and close its Kansas City hub.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here allowed Eastern to
proceed with the layoffs, as well, after the airline posted a $4.7
million bond to cover a month's worth of wages for the furloughed
workers.
   During Monday's hearing, Buckley challenged Linsey's argument
that the decision by Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., not to
invest any money in the financially troubled airline was motivated
by a desire to eventually close the carrier because its work force
was unionized.
   That decision ``also fits with certain financial realities,''
Buckley said.
   Buckley also suggested that Texas Air's decision to invest money
in Continental Airlines, Eastern's non-union sister carrier,
resulted from ``a business judgment that a dollar invested in
Continental will go further.''

   The United States and Soviet Union have held
preliminary talks on ways to limit the spread of ballistic missiles
to Third World countries, according to an administration official.
   U.S. officials had made it known earlier this month that they
hoped such a meeting could be arranged with Soviet officials while
they visited Washington for broader arms control discussions.
   The spread of ballistic missiles to such countries as Argentina,
Brazil and North Korea has been a concern of the United States and
its industrial allies for some time.
   The United States and its six major trading partners last year
agreed to restrict exports of items that could be used to build
ballistic missiles with a range of more than 180 miles and a
payload in excess of 1,100 pounds.
   The allies reiterated their concern about missile proliferation
among Third World nations at a meeting earlier this month in Rome
and it was hoped at that time to enlist Soviet involvement.
   The State Department said the subject was discussed in a meeting
Monday between Assistant Secretary of State Allen Holmes and Viktor
P. Karpov, the senior Soviet arms control negotiator.

Lobsters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 197th edition of the Old Farmer's
Almanac contains a forecast for a white Christmas in the East, a
prediction of woe for Red Sox fans, and former Sen. Edmund Muskie's
technique for mesmerizing lobsters.
   Published in tiny Dublin, N.H., the oldest continuously
published almanac in the United States hits newsstands today with
its usual, homey brand of ``new, useful and entertaining matter''
for the 9 million readers it claims.
   A competing Farmer's Almanac, which is marking its 55th year,
was released earlier this month. That publication is sold to banks,
insurance companies and other businesses for distribution to
customers as a promotion and claims a circulation of more than 5
million.
   Started in 1792, the 224-page Old Farmer's Almanac also contains
its usual fearless extended weather forecast for 1989 for 16 U.S.
regions.
   Editor Judson Hale claims 80 percent accuracy with the secret
formula and the ``most modern scientific calculation based on solar
activity,'' although it failed to predict last summer's devastating
drought.
   Looking ahead, the almanac predicts heavy snow starting around
Thanksgiving from Chicago to New England and down the East Coast,
with a frigid December in some sections before temperatures rise
and the weather dries.
   That means a white Christmas, but ``snow stopping in time for
cork popping'' at New Year's.
   While New England, southern Florida and the desert Southwest
should prepare for below-normal temperatures, the rest of the
country will get a warmer winter than usual.
   For the summer, the almanac calls for cooler, wetter weather
along the East Coast, normal temperatures in New England, Florida
and the Deep South, and drier weather in the Ohio Valley through
Chicago, Texas, Oklahoma and the Pacific Coast.
   But for the often-disappointed fans of Boston's beloved Red Sox,
next September's forecast is the most crucial: It comes with the
warning, ``Sox in first, expect the worst.''
   The familiar black and yellow publication, punctuated this year
with sporty red highlights, again offers predictions for consumers,
who can expect fake caviar, low-calorie tortilla chips, scented
newspaper ads and the ``ultimate indignity'' _ garbage rationing _
in the coming 15 months.
   The casual reader may also be drawn to educational features,
such as the ``straight facts about warts'' and ways to get rid of
them ranging from ``bizarre and complicated'' to ``extremely
disgusting'' and ``downright criminal.''
   Muskie, the former Democratic senator from Maine and U.S.
secretary of state, offered a followup to a 1984 article on
hypnotizing chickens with his own ``foolproof ways to hypnotize a
lobster.''
   By stroking the tail in a downward motion, ``curling it as you
go,'' he said, you can impress friends by getting the lobster to do
a claw stand on its head.
   A vigorous shake should bring the lobster back to its senses,
but if that doesn't work, Muskie wrote, just whisper in its ear,
``Drawn butter, drawn butter.''

   The aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower's
captain was relieved of his command and two other Navy officers
were reprimanded in the carrier's August collision with an anchored
freighter, a Navy spokesman says.
   Capt. Gary L. Beck was found guilty of hazarding his vessel in
an admiral's mast, a non-judicial proceeding, on Monday, said the
spokesman, Chief Petty Officer Phillip Wilkinson.
   Beck received a letter of reprimand in addition to being
relieved of command of the ship.
   The Eisenhower's navigator, Cmdr. Peter N. Maxwell, and the
officer of the deck at the time of the collision, Lt. Cmdr. John A.
Sullivan, were reprimanded for dereliction of duty in the
proceeding, Wilkinson said. Maxwell also was relieved of his duties
aboard the Eisenhower.
   The ship was returning to Norfolk Naval Station on Aug. 29 from
six months in the Mediterranean Sea when it brushed against the
Spanish freighter Urduliz, which was anchored in the Hampton Roads
harbor.
   Both vessels were damaged. There were no injuries.
   The incident was investigated by Rear Adm. Harold J. Bersen,
Wilkinson said. The findings of the admiral's mast will be
forwarded to the commander of the Atlantic Fleet for review.

that a flawed rocket booster design could fail if Challenger was
launched from the Kennedy Space Center in freezing temperatures.
   His concerns were ridiculed by NASA officials, then rejected by
Morton Thiokol managers.
   The space shuttle blew up the next day, exactly as Boisjoly
feared.
   He believes that despite a costly redesign and testing effort,
the rocket engines still have potentially disastrous weak spots.
   ``To me, it's just another disaster waiting to happen,'' said
the 50-year-old engineer.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off Thursday on the first manned
U.S. space mission since Challenger.
   NASA and the National Research Council, which has reviewed the
booster redesign and testing, say the new rocket engine is not
perfect, but is much safer than the one that failed with Challenger.
   Challenger was destroyed when pressurized flame leaked from a
joint between segments in one of the shuttles's pair of solid-fuel
rocket boosters, touching off an explosion that killed all seven
astronauts.
   In testimony before the Rogers Commission which investigated the
accident, Boisjoly revealed that NASA and Morton Thiokol knew the
rocket engines had leaked on past launches and were working toward
a solution even while continuing shuttle flights.
   Afterward, Boisjoly said, he was shunned by fellow workers and
neighbors, and Morton Thiokol put him on the sidelines while work
started on a redesign of the rocket joint.
   ``When I realized what was happening, it absolutely destroyed
me,'' Boisjoly said in a recent telephone interview. ``It destroyed
my career, my life, everything else. I'm just now getting back to
the point where I think I'll be able to work as an engineer again.''
   A doctor said Boisjoly was suffering from traumatic stress
syndrome, and the engineer took medical leave from Morton Thiokol.
Later, Boisjoly named the company in a series of lawsuits that
sought recovery of $2.07 billion for himself and the federal
government. The last of the suits was dismissed earlier this month
by a judge.
   In the past year, Boisjoly has toured the country, speaking
before engineering groups and attacking what he believes is a
``business as usual'' attitude in NASA and at Morton Thiokol.
   His theme is simple: Engineers have the obligation to report
shoddy work or design when they find it because people's safety is
at stake. But, says Boisjoly, the life of a whistleblower is often
unpleasant and could be personally disastrous.
   ``They (whistleblowers) should know that if they do speak out
against their organization they will pay some sort of a price,'' he
said.
   Boisjoly has received major awards from the American Association
for the Advancement of Science and the Institute of Electrical and
Electronic Engineers for his efforts to stop the Challenger launch
and to make changes in the shuttle rocket design.
   ``The very fact that some people are interested in what I stand
for has been very encouraging,'' he said.
   But Boisjoly said he is still looking for work, and added sadly,
``It's not the easiest thing to do to get a new job at 50 years old
even under normal conditions.''
   His home near the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah is up for sale.
Boisjoly and his wife hope to move to Phoenix.
   Wherever he goes, said Boisjoly, he's going to avoid watching
shuttle launches on television.
   ``I just don't want to go through that hell again,'' he said.

<HEAD>Army Accuses US Of Sponsoring Plan To Oust Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army claims 26 opposition
activists arrested last week were involved in a plan devised by
U.S. intelligence agents to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
and send him into exile.
   Col. Guillermo Wong, head of the army's G-2 intelligence unit,
presented a document to reporters Monday that he said security
agents discovered during the arrests.
   He claimed the six-page document, entitled ``Mission: To Force
the Departure of General Noriega'', was authored by U.S. officials
and proved U.S. involvement in efforts to oust Noriega.
   Terrence Kneebone, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, dismissed the
allegation as ``absurd'' and said it was designed ``to divert
attention from Panama's political problems.''
   The Reagan adminstration has imposed economic sanctions against
Panama in a bid to force Noriega to resign as commander of the
Defense Forces and the country's de facto ruler. Noriega was
indicted in Florida last February on charges of trafficking in
Colombian cocaine.
   Pro-government newspapers originally said 18 people were
arrested on Thursday and Friday for alleged involvement in
clandestine activities. But the army said Monday that 26 people
were detained.
   Wong told reporters the document was ``the work of the
intelligence services of the United States'' and could be found
``inside the U.S. psychological operations manuals.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Copies of the document were made available to reporters. It
appeared to be a telefax and was written in Spanish.
   Proposals outlined in the document included making contact with
potential dissidents within the army and disseminating anti-Noriega
propaganda, maintaining contact with the foreign press and lobbying
democratic governments in Venezuela and Colombia against Noriega.
   The document bore no identifying stamps, seals or signatures.
   Wong told reporters several weapons were discovered during the
arrests of the activists, but refused to provide details.
   Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, director of the army's National
Investigations Department, said several of those detained had
confessed to working with Reagan administration officials and two
former Panamanian military officers in a bid to undermine the
government.
   He said the two officers, identified as Lt. Col. Eduardo Herrera
and Maj. Cesar Villalaz, operated out of Washington and Miami. Some
of those arrested illegally left Panama on flights from the U.S.
Howard Air Base in the former Canal Zone to meet with Herrera and
Villalaz and plan strategy, Madrinan said.
   Madrinan and Wong alleged the 26 detainees belonged to two
anti-government groups they identified as the National Conformity
Movement and the March 16th Active Movement.
   Three detainees present at the news conference told reporters
they were involved in subversive activity against the government.
   One of them, Jose del Carmen Serracin, is director of the
Authentic Panamanian Party in the capital. Reporters were barred
from asking him questions.
   Wong said authorities were continuing their investigation and
that more arrests could be expected.
   Members of the Authentic Panamanian and Christian Democratic
parties last week rejected charges that those arrested were
involved in clandestine activities against the government.
   ``This is a method that the regime has used on various occasions
before against those of us who represent the democratic aspirations
of the people,'' Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian
Democratic Party, told reporters Friday.
   Federal Attorney General Carlos Villalaz denied charges that the
detainees had been tortured. ``Not one detainee has received
mistreatment,'' he told the news conference.

   Lincoln Center's share will be $200,000 for its new building,
which will house young artists and provide new public facilities.
The Metropolitan Opera Co. and New York Philharmonic will receive
$400,000 each. The Juilliard School, where music and the performing
arts are taught, will get $250,000.
   The Hearst Foundation, a leading supporter of the Lincoln Center
Consolidated Corporate Fund, will make its usual annual $100,000
donation, too.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson opened the California chapter
of the Rainbow Coalition by urging supporters to sign up new voters
who he said could provide a margin of victory for Democrat Michael
Dukakis in November's general election.
   ``As the Bible tells us, there's power in the word, and the vote
is the word,'' Jackson told more than 1,000 people Sunday at the
founding conference for the state chapter of the coalition, a
multiracial network Jackson founded.
   He said voters should go ``door-to-door, church-to-church,
synagogue-to-synagogue, school-to-school, and along the highways
and byways of this state'' to register voters.
   In a Sept. 20 letter to Rainbow Coalition board members, Jackson
said the nation's 13 million unregistered blacks and Hispanics
could be the margin of victory for Dukakis, who is running against
Vice President George Bush.
   ``We can't throw away this kind of power by not registering and
not voting,'' he wrote.
   Jackson, who lost the Democratic nomination to Dukakis, has
recently started to make campaign appearances on behalf of the
Massachusetts governor.
   This week Jackson said he planned to visit Tennessee, Georgia
and Maryland this week to urge Rainbow Coalition members to sign up
new voters.

   The man who Vice President George Bush says
his opponent is ``ridiculing'' when he refers to his running mate
as ``J. Danforth Quayle'' was an Army hero in World War II.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has repeatedly
referred to Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind, by his full name of J. Danforth
Quayle, a practice Bush condemned as ``beneath this process''
during Sunday's debate.
   James Alexander Danforth rose to the rank of captain in the Army
infantry and earned three Purple Hearts during the war, including
one in the D-Day invasion of Normandy. He died in an Army hospital
in England of the third wound, said Quayle campaign spokesman Jeff
Nesbitt.
   Danforth was a longtime friend of the Quayle family, and his
father attended the University of Illinois with the senator's
grandfather, said James Quayle, father of the senator.
   ``He was a great guy,'' James Quayle said. ``We lost a lot of
great friends, but Jimmy was the first one that died. What Bush

<HEAD>U.S. Team Leaves For Crash Site Surveys In Laos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team seeking to account
for missing U.S. servicemen flew to Laos today to survey sites
where American planes crashed during the Indochina war, an official
said.
   The team, which departed from Bangkok, is to survey an area
around Sepone in eastern Laos to prepare for possible later
excavations of the crash sites, said Maj. Thomas J. Boyd, spokesman
for the U.S. Pacific Command.
   The team is from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and
Army Central Identification Laboratory, both Honolulu-based units
seeking to account for 2,393 Americans missing in action from the
war in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
   Boyd said the team included a Marine with special expertise in
plane crashes.
   ``They will look at crash sites and determine what kind of
aircraft (crashed), how it crashed, and determine the potential for
possible future site excavations,'' Boyd told reporters.
   U.S. losses in that area near the Vietnamese border include
airmen downed in missions to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail, used by
communist North Vietnam to infiltrate troops to U.S.-backed South
Vietnam. The war ended with communist victories in all three
Indochinese countries in 1975.
   The United States and Laos have conducted three previous joint
crash site excavations, most recently in May.
   In Vietnam, meanwhile, a U.S. military team was working with
Vietnamese officials on the second day of an unprecedented
investigation to determine the fates of seven U.S. airmen lost in
plane crashes near the capital, Hanoi.
   The U.S. team, which brought its own interpreters, is
interviewing villagers who witnessed incidents in which the men
were lost and is seeking evidence such as local government reports
and human remains.
   Boyd said the seven are among 70 ``discrepancy cases'' _ those
in which the United States says there is strong evidence the men
survived and were taken under Vietnamese control. The United States
says it cannot prove any Americans are alive in Indochina, but
cannot ignore that possibility.
   The Defense Intelligence Agency is currently investigating 119
reports of purported sightings of Americans, Boyd said.
   The Americans drove to the Vietnamese villages Monday in jeeps
they had flown in from Honolulu the day before. The search is
scheduled to last about 10 days.
   Boyd said the two sides may later excavate plane crash sites
found during the investigation.
   Previously, the only significant joint field activity was in
late 1985, when U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese state workers dug up
the wreckage of a U.S. B-52 bomber just outside Hanoi. They found
remains but none were identified as missing Americans.
   Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, leader of the U.S. team in Vietnam, earlier
expressed hope for several joint investigation operations in the
coming months. ``We are prepared to provide four teams, if Vietnam
agrees,'' he said.
   Of the 2,393 Americans missing, 1,757 are in Vietnam, 547 in
Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in China. U.S. forces withdrew from
Indochina in 1973 after the conflict cost 58,000 American lives.

   More rain fell today in flooded parts of
the northern state of Punjab, hampering operations to rescue at
least 200,000 people marooned by rising waters, an official said.
   Fifty air force helicopters were deployed to lift people to
safer areas, but the operations were disrupted by rains, said J.F.
Ribeiro, adviser to the state governor.
   Ribeiro said at least 138 people have died in the flooding,
mainly from drownings, in Punjab since it began Wednesday. He said
the inundation had claimed at least 200 lives in the neighboring
states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.
   Punjab, the most populated of the four states, has borne the
brunt of the floods. The state's road and rail links with the rest
of the country were cut off, though airports were still functioning.
   The three major rivers in Punjab, the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej were
all flowing above danger levels, Ribeiro said. He said six of the
state's nine administrative districts had been affected.
   More than 1,500 villages in the six districts were inundated and
waters have entered low-lying areas of Ludhiana and Kapurthala
cities, he said.
   The floods were caused by heavy rains in northern India as the
annual southwest monsoon draws to a close. In New Delhi,
authorities ordered the closure of a bridge over the adjacent
Jamuna River, which is also flowing above the danger mark.
   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
reporters Monday that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had appointed a
crisis management group to tackle the emergency.
   Floods triggered by the summer monsoon are a frequent problem in
India, Nepal and Bangladesh.
   In late August, monsoon-swollen rivers innundated three-fourths
of Bangladesh in the worst floods in the country's histry. The
government said at least 1,000 people died but newspapers put the
toll at more than 2,000.

<TEXT>
   The weather in the Sunshine State
could be the critical factor as America's manned space program
looks to new life Thursday with the launching of shuttle Discovery.
   ``The potential is there'' for frequent delays because of tough
new weather constraints imposed after the Challenger disaster 2{
years ago, says Launch Director Bob Sieck.
   Never mind hurricanes. A stray cloud, a stiff wind or a shower
could ground the shuttle as surely as a mechanical breakdown.
   ``Based on historical statistics, there's a 60 percent chance we
will go'' on schedule, mission commander Frederick H. Hauck said
upon arrival at Cape Canaveral on Monday on a
rain-and-lightning-delayed flight from Houston.
   ``The bird is ready and we're ready,'' said Hauck. But, he
added, ``We're going to keep our fingers crossed on the weather.''
   The Florida peninsula is subject to fast-changing,
sometimes-unpredictable storms during the summer-autumn changeover,
particularly around this seaside spaceport.
   Thursday's forecast called for scattered and broken clouds,
widely scattered showers, a temperature of 85 degrees and
southeasterly winds of 10-15 knots.
   The new restrictions that would ban liftoff include:
   _ Moderate rain or other precipitation in either takeoff or
landing areas.
   _ Lightning within 10 miles of the launch pad 30 minutes before
liftoff.
   _ A temperature below 37 or above 99 degrees Fahrenheit.
   _ Surface winds 24 knots, or 17 knots from the South.
   Launch managers say stray clouds that drift near the pad from as
far away as the Gulf Coast, 150 miles away on the other side of the
peninsula, would keep the shuttle grounded. There can be no
lightning-producing clouds within 10 nautical miles of the launch
site.
   Cold weather was found to be a key factor in the Challenger
disaster, preventing a seal on a right booster rocket joint from
doing its job of stopping the escape of gases which ignited the
orbiter's main fuel tank.
   Responsibility for safe launch conditions is in the hands of the
Air Weather Service detachment at nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station. It is in constant touch with meteorologists at weather
facilities all along Discovery's planned flight path.
   The Air Force weather watchers rely on sounding rockets that
gather information in the atmosphere 250,000 feet up, weather
balloons carrying instrument packages, wind towers, lightning
sensors as far west as the Walt Disney World area about 50 miles
away, radar antennas that scan the ocean and satellite data.
   But man is critical to the system, particularly because of the
volatile conditions in the area, said Air Force Col. John T.
Madura, staff meteorologist for the Eastern Space and Missile
Center.
   Madura has final responsibility for giving a go-for-launch
signal, or aborting the liftoff, because of weather conditions.
   ``No constraints go from red to green unless I say so,'' he said.

<HEAD>Computer Whiz, 14, To Present Paper on New Way To Fight Colon
Cancer</HEAD>

   Ray Bateman Jr. fixed the family vacuum
cleaner when he was 3.
   Now, at 14, he's investigating ways to fight cancer. A number of
scientific authorities believe he is on the right track.
   Bateman, braces and all, might raise some eyebrows when he
presents his paper on colon cancer at a clinical research
conference next month.
   But his co-researcher and next-door neighbor, cancer specialist
Dr. Glenn Tisman, said that even if the adolescent's voice cracks a
little, few will doubt his competence by the end of his
presentation.
   ``Working with him was like working with a (post-doctoral)
fellow,'' Tisman said. ``His abilities are remarkable and he was
full of knowledge about chemistry even though he hasn't ever taken
a chemistry course in school.''
   Bateman, a high school freshman and computer whiz, spent more
than 1,300 hours researching the project, Tisman said.
   ``But he's still a kid, basically,'' Tisman added. ``My lab
technician used to complain that Ray would leave his candy wrappers
laying around.''
   And like a kid, Bateman is concerned about having to miss two
days of school. ``But my teachers believe this is a legitimate
reason to be gone,'' he said. ``And besides, this should help me
get into college.''
   Bateman will travel with Tisman to New York to present their
research Oct. 7 at an American Federation of Clinical Research
conference. Rules dictate that if two authors submit a paper and
one of them is older than 41, the younger author is the presenter.
Tisman is 46.
   ``His being so young will surprise some people,'' Tisman said.
``But I have confidence in him.''
   Bateman's father said his son's accomplishments don't surprise
him.
   ``When Ray Jr. was 3 years old, the vacuum cleaner broke, and by
God, he fixed it,'' said the retired civil engineer.
   The method Tisman and Bateman developed will need further
testing, but Tisman said it has been effective at his private
clinic in Whittier.
   The new therapy is a twist on existing treatment of colon
cancer, Tisman said. It combines two drugs, 5-Fluorodeoxyuridine,
or 5-FUdR, and Leucovorin, which kill cancer cells by inhibiting
replication of DNA, an essential element in all living matter,
Tisman said.
   A similar drug, 5-Fluorouracil, or 5-FU, has been used with
Leucovorin to treat certain types of cancer since researchers
discovered a few years ago that Leucovorin increased 5-FU's
effectiveness.
   But Tisman and Bateman said their research suggests 5-FUdR may
be more effective than 5-FU when used with Leucovorin.
   Dr. Youcef Rustum, a noted cancer researcher and deputy director
of the Grace Cancer Drug Center at Roswell Park Memorial Institute
in Buffalo, called the research an ``important concept in cancer
chemotherapy.''
   Bateman, an only child, said most of his free time is spent with
his computer. When he was 11, he attended a computer camp at
Stanford University aimed at high school seniors. He has $23,000
worth of computer gear, centering on a Macintosh II, the fifth
computer his father has bought him since he was 9.
   ``He just keeps outgrowing them, I guess,'' his father said.

<HEAD>Carter Eulogized as Man of Wit and Courage</HEAD>

   Billy Carter, known to millions as the
wisecracking brother of the nation's 39th president, was eulogized
as a couragous man who was prepared to devote his life helping
others overcome alcoholism.
   ``Billy Carter was struck down in the prime of his life,''
country singer Tom T. Hall said in the eulogy at a graveside
ceremony Monday. ``He was just beginning a new chapter. He was
planning his travels to help others take charge of their lives.''
   Carter, 51, died Sunday of pancreatic cancer, the disease that
killed his father and an older sister.
   About 500 mourners gathered at the Lebanon Cemetery to pay their
last respects to Carter, who was thrust into the national spotlight
after his older brother, Jimmy, became president in 1977.
   The younger Carter became well known for his down-home and often
irreverent witticisms and his beer-drinking at a service station he
once owned in Plains.
   Billy Carter's widow, Sybil, and the couple's six children were
seated in front of Carter's cherry casket, which was covered by a
blanket of exotic flowers and surrounded by dozens of wreaths.
   In the crowd were Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, who lived
next door to Billy Carter. The former president said his
relationship with his brother, strained during his years in the
White House, improved in later years.
   ``We worked together for many years, side by side. While I was
president, we went in opposite directions, but in the last year,
we've just been friends,'' he said.
   ``My mother said, `Never underestimate him,''' the former
president said. ``He was the most intelligent one in the family.''
   In delivering the eulogy, Hall noted that Carter had overcome
many of his own personal problems and was planning to work with
others overcoming alcoholism.
   In 1979, Carter spent seven weeks in an alcohol rehabilitation
program.
   ``He died with courage, not to say he went gently into that dark
night,'' Hall said.
   In the year since his cancer was diagnosed, Carter had tried a
variety of experimental treatments. He lived longer than his
doctors expected.
   Carter was buried a short distance from the graves of his mother
``Miss Lillian'' Carter, and his father, James Earl Carter.
   The service was conducted by the Rev. Dan Ariail, pastor of the
Maranatha Baptist Church, where Jimmy Carter teaches Sunday school.

   The dollar slipped against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today while gold prices firmed.
   Currency traders said the market was assessing the impact of
Monday's concerted central bank intervention. They said the
intervention, started by the West German Bundesbank, dumped between
$300 million and $500 million on the market.
   In London, traders were also awaiting the 11:30 (6:30 a.m. EDT)
release of British trade figures for August. The current account
deficit is expected to be between 1.2 billion and 1.9 billion
pounds ($2 billion and $3.1 billion.)
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 134.58 yen, down 0.15 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 134.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8825 West German marks, down from 1.8835
   _1.5935 Swiss francs, unchanged
   _6.4065 French francs, down from 6.5000
   _2.1212 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1230
   _1,404.00 Italian lire, up from 1,403.50
   _1.2195 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2211
   In London, the British pound was little changed, trading at
1.6695 dollars, compared with 1.6668 late Monday.
   Gold prices firmed in lackluster trading.
   The precious metal opened in London at a bid of $395.70 a troy
ounce, up from $394.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $397.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $396.70, up from $392.00 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 3.01 to close at a bid 401.16.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.14 a troy
ounce, little changed from late Monday's 6.16.

<HEAD>Cool Autumn Air Chills Northern Plains, Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cool autumn air chilled parts of the northern Plains and the
Northeast today and scattered showers dampened the Pacific
Northwest and Florida.
   A cold front pushed through the central Plains today, dropping
early morning temperatures into the 30s and 40s in the northern
Plains.
   Temperatures were in the 40s in New England and the northern
Appalachians because of a cool Canadian air mass centered over New
York state. Readings dropped into the 30s in some parts of Maine.
   Thunderstorms dumped locally heavy rain on parts of the Florida
Keys, and thunderstorms also were scattered over northern Florida.
   Further north, fog draped the southern and central Appalachians,
reducing visibility to near zero in parts of southeast Kentucky.
   Showers ahead of an approaching cold front scattered light rain
over the Pacific Northwest.
   Most other parts of the country enjoyed fair skies.
   Today's forecast called for showers across the Pacific Northwest
and the northern Plateau region, and northern New England. Showers
and thunderstorms were expected in Florida, Nebraska and the
Dakotas. Clouds were expected in the upper Great Lakes, but skies
were predicted to be mostly sunny elsewhere.
   Highs were forecast to be in the 50s and 60s across the
country's northern tier from New England and the northern Great
Lakes to the Pacific Northwest; and in the 90s from much of Texas
to the desert Southwest. Highs elsewhere were predicted to be
mainly in the 70s and 80s.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 36 degrees at Concord,
N.H., and Loring Air Force Base, Limestone, Maine, to 83 at Phoeniz.

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes dive-bombed Shiite
Moslem guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon today in the 15th
Israeli raid into Lebanon this year, police said.
   At least two Israeli jet fighters took part in the air attack on
bases belonging to Hezbollah, or Party of God, the police said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
   Hezbollah is made up of Shiite zealots backed by the Islamic
revolution of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The attack lasted 10 minutes, during which the planes bombed the
militants' positions in pine woods near the Christian-inhabited
town of Jezzine the police spokesman said.
   Smoke billowed from the stricken bases after the attacks, which
began at 11:30 a.m., he said.
   In Jerusalem, an army spokesman said the targets had served as
headquarters for planning and executing attacks against Israeli
forces and Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen in Israel's
self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon.
   The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the pilots made
accurate hits on their targets and returned safely.
   In Lebanon, police said Hezbollah gunners returned fire at the
planes with anti-aircraft weapons but missed their targets.
   The Israeli army communique said the planes struck at a site
near the village of Al-Luwayzah, 10 miles north of the Christian
town of Marjayoun, where Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen are
based.
   On Friday, Israeli warplanes attacked Palestinian guerrilla
bases near the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon, apparently in
retaliation for a Sept. 16 infiltration attempt.
   Police said three guerrillas were killed and five were missing
and presumed killed after the attack. Sixty-five people were killed
and 108 wounded in the previous Israeli raids this year.
   Israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in June 1985
after a three-year occupation but maintains a six-to-10-mile wide
buffer zone north of the Israeli border. The area is patrolled by
about 1,000 Israeli troops and 1,500 militiamen of the South
Lebanon Army.
   Jezzine is the northernmost position manned by the South Lebanon
Army militia.

   A Mexican drug trafficker tied to a murder by
a strand of hair became the second of three defendants to be
convicted in the 1985 torture killing of a U.S. drug agent in
Mexico.
   Rene Verdugo Urquidez, portrayed by prosecutors as the chief
lieutenant of reputed Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, was
found guilty Monday by a jury that deliberated four days.
   The panel was to return today to deliberate further on the third
defendant's guilt or innocence.
   The remaining defendant, Jesus Felix Gutierrez, the 38-year-old
former owner of a Los Angeles seafood company, is charged with
aiding and abetting Caro in his escape to Costa Rica after the
killing of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena
and his pilot, Alfred Zavala Avelar.
   Verdugo, 36, was convicted of five counts of conspiracy,
kidnapping, murder and two counts of violent acts in support of
racketeering. The latter charge is a new statute aimed at
drug-related crimes.
   The battered bodies of Camarena and his pilot were found buried
at a remote ranch outside Guadalajara in March 1985, nearly a month
after Camarena was kidnapped outside the U.S. Consulate in the
Mexican city.
   The only physical evidence against Verdugo was a single strand
of hair found at Caro's Guadalajara compound, where Camarena is
believed to have been killed.
   Circumstantial evidence came from government informants,
including other drug smugglers who said they heard Verdugo discuss
the Camarena killing.
   One witness who made a plea bargain with the government told of
seeing Verdugo at the villa the day of the murder. He said Verdugo
spoke with another man about ``a problem'' they had just solved.
   Verdugo could be sentenced to life in prison. Sentencing was set
for Oct. 26.
   The federal jury convicted former Mexican policeman Raul Lopez
Alvarez in the murders on Thursday.
   Verdugo, an admitted drug trafficker, and his attorneys sighed
when U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie read the first guilty
verdict.
   Defense attorney Michael Pancer portrayed Verdugo as a pawn in a
political game played by the Mexican and U.S. governments. He said
Verdugo was sacrificed to close an embarassing case that had
strained relations between the two countries.
   ``Rene is innocent,'' Pancer told reporters. ``They flat-out
fooled this jury.''
   Prosecutors witheld comment until after jurors return the last
verdict. Prosecutors contend Caro ordered the killings as
retribution for Camarena's role in raids on Caro's marijuana
plantations. They said that Verdugo helped in the executions.
   Evidence showed the agent and pilot were tortured with red-hot
metal pipes and beaten so severely that Camarena's skull was
crushed.
   Lopez, 28, was a member of a Mexican state police homicide squad
in Guadalajara at the time. His sentencing was set for Oct. 24.
   Caro, 37, and an associate, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, were
convicted in Mexico last week on narcotics and weapons charges.
Caro was sentenced to 34 years and Fonseca to 11 years.
   Nine men were indicted in Los Angeles but only three were tried
here. One defendant subsequently died. Four, including Caro and
Fonseca, were tried in Mexico on narcotics and murder charges.
Verdicts have not yet been reached on some of those charges,
including the murder charges.

<HEAD>CDC Unveils New `Hot Lab' For Studying World's Deadliest Viruses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Centers for Disease Control researchers
soon will move into their new ``hot lab,'' a $20 million
super-sealed laboratory with a 21st century feel, to study the
world's deadliest viruses.
   CDC officials unveiled it Monday, showing off the secret-code
passageways, air locks, decontamination equipment, containment
cabinets and space suits that will be off-limits to all outsiders
once deadly pathogens are brought in starting next month. The
complex will be formally dedicated Oct. 28.
   For years, the center has studied what scientists call Level 4
pathogens: mircroorganisms or viruses with the most dangerous
classification according to deadliness, availability of vaccine or
treatment and risk of transmission in the laboratory.
   Such agents include Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever and
Rift Valley fever, diseases rarely, if ever, seen in this country
and much more hazardous in the lab than AIDS or rabies, said Dr.
Olen M. Kew, chief of the Molecular Virology Laboratory at the
center.
   The CDC's first facility for the study of such pathogens, built
in 1967, was in a large trailer. Two larger labs followed.
   The new facility, officially known as the Viral and Rickettsial
Diseases Laboratory but called ``the hot lab'' by those who work
there, will give CDC researchers more space and more modern
technology than they've ever had before, said Dr. Mike Kiley, a
microbiologist with the Office of Biosafety.
   ``After 10 years, the old Level 4 lab was beginning to show its
age,'' Kiley said.
   ``This will very much contribute to our overall mission of
controlling infectious disease ... around the world,'' said Dr.
James M. Hughes, deputy director of the CDC's Center for Infectious
Diseases.
   The laboratory building, located at the federal health agency's
compound near Emory University, spans more than 95,000 square feet
and is actually two buildings in one _ a six-story facility
containing 12 separate labs, and a three-story Level 4 facility
with two separate state-of-the-art containment labs, connected by a
central atrium.
   The new labs also have intricate waste disposal facilities, to
inactivate, then remove, any hazardous substances.
   Walls in the new Level 4 facility are poured concrete, 9 inches
thick. Inside, the labs themselves, researchers will wear blue
plastic space suits, connected to a safe air supply by red hoses
which dangle from various points above them.
   To enter their lab, they will pass through a series of
increasingly secure checkpoints _ from the card-key system which
opens the outer corridor doors, to a secret-code control which
opens inner doors, to heavy, submarine-style steel gasket doors
opening into a special chemical shower and air lock. That, in turn,
opens onto the lab.
   Getting in takes about five minutes; getting out takes about 20,
as workers shower first in their space suits _ with a special
disinfectant fluid _ then take showers themselves.
   ``We go out to lunch sometimes, but you don't drink a lot of
coffee in the morning,'' joked research microbiologist Luanne
Elliott. ``It takes too long to get in and out.''

<HEAD>Judge Approves Settlement for Owners of Kodak Instant Cameras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 3.4 million U.S. owners of Eastman Kodak
Co.'s discontinued instant cameras should get up to $70 in cash and
coupons just in time for Christmas under a new settlement.
   ``I think both sides agree it's an excellent settlement,'' said
Burton I. Weinstein of Chicago, one of four attorneys who filed the
class-action lawsuit against Kodak, saying he was ``very, very
pleased'' after Monday's decision.
   Kodak, which was forced to stop making instant cameras and film
after a patent dispute, said the settlement is worth $150 million,
but attorneys for camera owners pegged it at more than $200 million.
   The settlement approved by Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas
Rakowski applies to 39 Kodak instant camera models, ranging from
the Fiesta, the lowest-priced model, to the Kodamatic 980L, the
most expensive.
   Weinstein said the cash and coupons would probably be mailed in
late November, in time for Christmas shopping.
   Depending on the cost of their instant camera, owners will
receive amounts ranging from $52 in cash and $18 in coupons to
$19.50 in cash and $30.50 in coupons.
   The coupons, accompanied by proof of purchase, then can be sent
to the company for a rebate. The coupons could also be used in
purchasing Kodak products such as film, cameras or batteries.
   ``From Kodak's point of view, it's good and fair,'' said William
Campbell, a Chicago attorney representing the Rochester, N.Y.,
company.
   The lawsuit was filed against the company in January 1986,
asking that it compensate owners for instant cameras that were
virtually useless after a ruling against Kodak in its legal battle
with Polaroid Corp.
   A federal judge in Boston said Kodak infringed on Polaroid's
instant-camera patent when it entered the market in 1976.
   Instant photography was invented by Dr. Edwin H. Land, founder
of Polaroid, and was first marketed in 1948. It enables users to
view a photographic print shortly after taking a picture.
   Polaroid retained a monopoly in the instant photography field
until 1976, when Kodak entered the market with a competing system.
Polaroid immediately filed a lawsuit, charging patent infringement.
   A federal judge in Boston sided with Polaroid and the U.S.
Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings when it refused to hear
Kodak's appeal in October 1986.

   China has concluded a rocket launching into the
East China Sea and normal navigation and air flights through the
area can resume Wednesday, the official Xinhua News Agency
announced today.
   The report did not say when the launching took place or what was
the purpose of launching the ``carrier'' rocket.
   Western military experts in Beijing speculated that the launch
either could be a test of new models of satellite booster rockets
now being developed or, more likely, a Chinese Navy missile.
   On Sept. 8, Xinhua warned ships and planes to stay out of the
target area, located about 112 miles off of China's Zhejiang
province and with a radius of 35 nautical miles, between 10 a.m.

hotel got a taste of TV stardom when they were invited to appear on
the soap opera ``Ryan's Hope.''
   An actress on the show, Ilene Kristen, invited the children to
perform in an episode after she met them in July when she
volunteered to teach acting, singing and fitness at the hotel.
   Paid union scale of $97 each, they performed Monday in an
episode in which welfare hotel residents chase a drug dealer from
their neighborhood.
   Antoine Robinson, 12, who lives with his family in an apartment
now, had made such an impression on Kristen that he was given a

   ``No, I'm confident, babe,'' he told her when asked if he wanted
to rehearse.
   The episode is to air Oct. 6.

   Uncounted numbers of teen-agers and children
who this year filed their first tax returns are about to get a
message from the IRS: Pay your overdue taxes or your bank account
may be seized.
   The Internal Revenue Service, weary at being equated with the
Grinch that stole Christmas, is going out of its way to avoid
carrying out that threat.
   Almost six months after the April 15 deadline for filing 1987
returns, the IRS is completing a series of mailings to more than 15
million taxpayers of all ages who filed but failed to pay all or
part of their taxes.
   Because as many as 8 million young people were brought onto the
tax rolls in 1987, the IRS believes the number of taxpayers who
didn't pay up includes many first-time filers. And the agency is
trying to impress on them the importance of paying up.
   ``We assume these younger taxpayers are not too sophisticated
about the tax laws and we are trying to make them aware of their
obligations,'' IRS spokesman Frank Keith said Monday.
   The young people at risk could be a 1- or 2-year-olds with
interest or dividends on investments given to them, or a
19-year-old college student with a part-time job. Each could have
become liable for taxes in 1987 because of the big tax overhaul
enacted a year earlier.
   ``With several million new filers as a result of this new law,
there's no question but that there are some folks who filed returns
without paying,'' said Charles Hoyle, deputy assistant IRS
commissioner for collections. ``The notices (of taxes due) are out
there and we're hoping they will contact us and try to resolve this
without having to resort to any type of collection action.''
   Any taxpayer who files a return on time but fails to pay the
taxes due is likely to receive one or more comnputer-generated
notices from the IRS. There usually is a series of four letters,
three or four weeks apart, each sounding a little tougher than the
last. The fourth letter cautions that the IRS will take legal
action to collect the tax unless it is paid within 10 days.
   That action, Hoyle notes, can include seizing the bank account
of a child with interest income or the wages of one who is on a
payroll.
   Past-due bills are subject to 10 percent interest plus a penalty
that climbs to 1 percent a month after the fourth notice is sent.
   Under the 1986 law, any child must file a return if he or she
has any combination of earnings and unearned income _ including
interest and dividends _ over $500. The unexpected tax bite on many
young people comes from another change: Any child who can be
claimed as a dependent by a parent is denied a personal exemption
on his or her own return.

   The tax evasion trial of real estate magnate
Harry Helmsley and his hotel queen wife, Leona, has been delayed
until early next year because of a legal appeal.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge John Walker on Monday was
unrelated to a defense lawyer's claim that the 79-year-old Helmsley
suffers from ``acute memory difficulties.''
   In a affidavit filed late last week, Helmsley's attorney John
Wing wrote the judge that his client's memory problems ``render him
unable to assist adequately in his own defense.''
   After examinations by five neurologists and neuro-psychologists,
all but one of ``concluded that Mr. Helmsley has a significant
memory disability,'' Wing said.
   Wing, who sought an indefinite delay of the businessman's trial,
said, ``forcing him to stand trial in his present condition would
effectively deprive him of his constitutional rights.''
   Walker, who has postponed the Helmsleys' trial twice before,
delayed the case until Jan. 16 because of a legal appeal by Mrs.
Helmsley and a court scheduling conflict.
   The Helmsleys were indicted in April on state and federal
charges that they allegedly disguised about $4 million in
renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as business expenses
and took bogus tax deductions.
   The Helmsleys and two former aides have pleaded innocent to the
188-count state indictment and the 47-count federal indictment.
State prosecutors have agreed to let the federal case go first.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 67, is appealing Walker's denial of her bid to
dismiss the federal indictment. She said she was granted immunity
from prosecution for her grand jury testimony in an earlier state
sales tax investigation.
   Prosecutors say court papers on the appeal could not be filed
until Oct. 14. Also, one of the defense attorneys begins a
previously scheduled trial on Nov. 21 before another judge.
   Walker said an unidentified doctor ``interviewed and examined''
Helmsley over the weekend and ``expressed some views to me'' over
the telephone. The judge said he would not rule on the defense
motion to sever Helmsley from the case until he sees the doctor's
written report.

<TEXT>
   Parliament today named Mieczyslaw
Rakowski, a longtime foe of the Solidarity trade union, as the
country's ninth prime minister since World War II.
   The choice of party propaganda chief Rakowski comes less than a
month before planned talks between the government and Solidarity on
reinstating the labor federation's legal status and reviving
Poland's crippled economy.
   Rakowski, a journalist who represented communist authorities in
1980-81 talks with Solidarity, became prime minister by a 338-5
vote, with 35 abstentions, in a nationally televised parliament
vote.
   The new prime minister immediately asked for two weeks to form a
new government composed of people with ``reformist attitudes'' and
said he would seek to broaden the communist-dominated governing
coalition.
   ``I want to create a Cabinet which will have a broader social
confidence. We are being told, `Move over. Let others participate
in actual co-rule,''' he said.
   Before the vote, Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski told the
Sejm, or parliament, that the new government would be open to
dialogue and economic reform. Rakowski, 61, had been proposed for
the job by Jaruzelski and on Monday received the backing of the
230-member Communist Party Central Committee.
   The party controls the government through its majority in the
Sejm.
   In a nominating speech that lasted nearly 30 minutes, Jaruzelski
said Poland was in a promising period despite its economic
difficulties and political divisions. He referred to upcoming talks
with the opposition and other representatives of Polish society.
   ``To build the future together we all have to change ... Let us
abandon narrow-mindedness,'' the Polish leader said.
   He said there would be no ``forbidden topics'' in the talks, but
said they must have a ``rational framework'' that respects the
constitutional order, a phrase used to refer to the dominant role
of the Communist Party.
   Jaruzelski said the new government would be ``bold and
effective'' in dealing with the economy by introducing reforms
while protecting living standards.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa expressed hope that Rakowski's
attitudes as prime minister would not be affected by his record as
an opponent of the banned union movement.
   ``It's not important where one comes from,'' Walesa said from
his home in Gdansk Monday evening. ``What's important is what one
comes with ... We hope he will come with pluralism, with a
willingness for reform, which is what the country needs.''
   Ryszard Bender, an independent parliament deputy, predicted the
nomination would not harm the talks with the opposition planned for
mid-October.
   ``Things happening in our country now are so interesting that
philosophers never even dreamt of them,'' he said. ``Things are
changing fast. Maybe he (Rakowski) will change his opinion of
Walesa and Solidarity too.''
   Rakowski, who became the Politburo member in charge of
propaganda in December, takes over as prime minister from Zbigniew
Messner, who resigned Sept. 19 with his entire Cabinet, accused of
mishandling the economy.
   ``I think that Rakowski is a skilled man, a very good
politician,'' said Ryszard Wojna, a leader of the Sejm's Communist
Party caucus.
   But Bronislaw Geremek, a senior adviser to Walesa, said what
matters is whether government policies change: ``If Mr. Rakowski
brings a political program of a new open policy of dialogue with
the society, then it will be very good.''
   As prime minister, Rakowski will face difficult challenges.
Confidence in the government has eroded, inflation is running at 60
percent annually, consumer goods are in short supply and workers
are restless after staging two punishing waves of strikes this year.
   Poland's worst labor unrest in seven years ended Sept. 3 when
authorities set aside their longstanding opposition to negotiating
with Solidarity. Walesa agreed to call an end to the strikes after
the government promised to discuss reinstating the union movement.
   Then deputy prime minister, Rakowski became unpopular with
Solidarity activists as the official responsible for negotiating
with the union movement during its legal existence in 1980-81.
   Although he had been a liberal within the party, he strongly
defended the December 1981 military crackdown that suppressed
Solidarity, which was banned the next fall.
   Party secretary Wladyslaw Baka, an economist elevated to the
Politburo in June, had been considered a hopeful for the prime
minister's post.
   But Bender said Rakowski may have been chosen because the party
wanted ``someone with a political, rather than economic, dimension
... And Rakowski is a politician.''
   Rakowski served as editor-in-chief of the party weekly Polityka
from 1958 to 1982, where he gained a reputation as a progressive
and alienated party hardliners. But he was close to Jaruzelski,
serving under him as deputy prime minister from 1981 to 1985.
   When Jaruzelski turned over the prime minister's job to Messner
in November 1985, Rakowski also left the government. He held a
largely ceremonial parliament post until gaining a seat on the
ruling Politburo last year.

   The executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union today accused Vice President George Bush of
``McCarthyite slander'' against the organization during his
nationally televised debate Sunday night with Democrat Michael
Dukakis.
   The official, Ira Glasser, said Bush's statement that the ACLU
is involved in a lawsuit seeking to remove the tax exemption of the
Roman Catholic Church is wrong, as is a suggestion that the group
favors allowing child pornography.
   ``That kind of slur, that kind of McCarthyite slander, in
characterizing what the ACLU does, is outrageous and it does not
characterize what the ACLU is about,'' Glasser said on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   He referred to the 1950s anti-communist campaign of Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, R-Wis., in which many people were tarred as Communist
sympathizers without proof.
   There is a court case challenging the Catholic church's tax
exemption but the ACLU is not involved, Glasser said. He said his
organization is on record favoring criminal penalties in cases of
child pornography.
   ``The fact is that we are devoted to only one thing, and that is
the non-partisan defense of the Bill of Rights,'' Glasser said.
``Sooner or later everybody needs the ACLU. When your
constitutional rights are threatened or violated, you'll come to
the ACLU.''
   Haley Barbour of the Bush campaign responded: ``The ACLU has a
well-earned reputation as caring more about criminals' rights and
prisoners' rights than they care about victims' rights.''
   On Monday, ACLU president Norman Dorsen said Bush had ``totally
twisted'' the group's positions Sunday night as he sought to
portray Dukakis as a liberal outside the American mainstream.
   ``In terms of our day-to-day work over many years, we have
consistently acted in a non-partisan way on behalf of some of the
most basic principles of the Constitution,'' Dorsen said. ``Our
positions are mainstream positions.''
   Bush has repeatedly attacked Dukakis for being a ``card-carrying
member'' of the civil liberties union.
   In Sunday's debate, he said: ``I don't want my 10-year-old
granddaughter to go into an X-rated movie. ... I don't think
they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the
Catholic Church. I don't want to see the kiddie pornography laws
repealed. I don't want to see `Under God' come out from our
currency. Now, these are all positions of the ACLU and I don't
agree with them.''
   Dorsen said the ACLU does not want 10-year-olds to see
pornographic movies, but believes that the movie rating system
amounts to illegal censorship.
   ``We believe that's a decision that should be made by each
family,'' he said.
   He agreed that the ACLU opposes tax exemptions for churches on
the basis that they amount to a government subsidy of religion. He
stressed that the organization's position applies to all religious
groups, not just the Catholic Church.
   Dorsen also took issue with Bush's ``kiddie pornography''
attack, saying, ``Our view is that the government can prosecute the
makers of pornography (for) the improper use of children for this
purpose. We don't feel that the material itself can be censored.''
   Finally, Dorsen said, the ACLU has never challenged the use of
``In God We Trust'' on currency, although he agreed that such use
is contrary to the organization's principles.
   ``It's not part of the government's job to promote a religious
belief, and the Supreme Court has said that as far back as 1947,''
he said. But Dorsen said the ACLU has never tried to have the words
removed from currency.
   Dorsen also pointed out that the organization recently defended
Lt. Col. Oliver North, saying the government violated his Fifth
Amendment rights when it prosecuted him for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   And, Dorsen said, the ACLU is about to file a brief in federal
court in Washington on behalf of former White House aide Lyn
Nofziger, saying he is being improperly prosecuted for illegal
lobbying.

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS VANDEGRIFT IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sailing into
the Strait of Hormuz under a full moon, this U.S. missile frigate
tried to draw within 900 feet of the supertanker Townsend, a
lumbering 294,739-ton behemoth more than 81 times its size.
   The purpose, explained the Vandegrift's skipper, was to see if
the little warship could snuggle close enough to the tanker so that
together they would appear as one blip on radar screens in Iran's
so-called ``Silkworm Alley.''
   ``It's just something the Pentagon wanted us to try,'' said
Cmdr. Eric Utegaard of Alexandria, Va., as his ship struggling to
maintain 17 knots in the churning wake of the Townsend's
30-foot-wide propeller.
   Utegaard could not know last Saturday that ``Operation Earnest
Will'' mission No. 89 would mark the final time a U.S. warship
would escort a Kuwaiti oil tanker through the Persian Gulf.
   Today, the first U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker to sail without a
close escort of U.S. warships left Kuwait's main terminal, heading
south through waters where peace has prevailed since the Iran-Iraq
cease-fire began Aug. 20.
   Although traveling alone, the 81,283-ton oil products carrier
Surf City would not be unprotected should trouble arise during its
two-day, 550-mile passage through the gulf and Strait of Hormuz,
U.S. military sources said.
   ``She's on her way, and will be under surveillance at all
times,'' one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   While the Vandegrift trailed the tanker at a distance, for the
first time since the U.S. convoy escort policy began July 21, 1987,
no warship was sailing directly behind it.
   However, mine fears remain high following reports that Italian
mine-hunters had found an explosive in the south central gulf _ the
third discovered in five days.
   The White House announced Monday the reduction of tension since
the Iran-Iraq cease-fire had led President Reagan to end the
``tight escort'' operation.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. warships will
continue to be stationed in the gulf, prepared to assist any ship
that might need help. The United States now has 26 ships in the
region.
   Right to the end, the Navy was looking for better ways to
conduct an operation in which its ships had already sailed 50,000
miles escorting convoys through the embattled oil artery.
   The Long Beach, Calif.-based Vandegrift was the Townsend's lone
escort for the voyage northward, and earlier had accompanied the
88th mission, a northbound convoy with the 401,382-ton Bridgeton,
famous for hitting a mine during the first ``Earnest Will'' mission.
   The Bridgeton's encounter with a 500-pound mine apparently laid
by the Iranians pointed up what U.S. officers such as Utegaard say
is ``still the single biggest threat in the gulf.''
   Apart from the Bridgeton, no ship under U.S. escort encountered
any difficulty with mines, missiles, aircraft or gunboat attacks.
   Last Oct. 16, however, an Iranian Silkworm missile attack
severely damaged the 81,283-ton tanker Sea Isle City at Kuwait's Al
Ahmadi loading terminal and the ship's American master was badly
wounded.
   The ship, like the Bridgeton, later returned to service.
   Forty-six Americans have died in the gulf since shortly before
the U.S. began escorting ships. On May 17, 1987, an Iraqi fighter
jet mistakenly fired two missiles into the frigate USS Stark,
killing 37 U.S. sailors. Nine Americans died in the gulf after the
escorts began _ seven in helicopter crashes and two in the crash of
a Navy plane from a carrier support group in Arabian Sea.
   The cruiser USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian jetliner in the
gulf on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard, after crewmen
mistook it for an attacking Iranian fighter jet.
   Although the ostensible purpose of ``Operation Earnest Will''
was to protect the 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers and underscore a
U.S. commitment to freedom of navigation, officials say it was
motivated greatly by Washington's concern about growing Soviet
influence in the gulf.
   Some diplomats noted it was only after Moscow agreed to lease
three tankers to Kuwait and give them armed escort protection that
the United States moved firmly to reflag and escort part of
Kuwait's fleet.
   The escort missions proved formidable enough that other foreign
ships became ``tag-alongs,' lining up ahead, behind or alongside
the American convoys as they traveled the dangerous waters of
Hormuz and the southern gulf where Iranian raiders were most active.
   Some even painted their sterns with American names to dupe
Iranian gunners into thinking they were part of the reflagged
Kuwaiti fleet.

   Riot police swinging truncheons charged into
crowds of rock-hurling leftist militants protesting the World
Bank-International Monetary Fund talks. Paramedics said both police
and protesters were injured.
   The street battle took place Monday night after about 1,500
people staged a demonstration downtown to protest what they called
unfair financial policies of industrialized nations toward heavily
indebted Third World countries.
   Finance ministers of 22 countries are attending the annual
meeting along with thousands of other finance officials. The talks
open officially today with a speech by West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   Violence erupted Monday night after police had broken up the
demonstration. About 500 radicals blockaded streets leading to the
German Opera, where hundreds were watching a production of Mozart's
``The Magic Flute'' staged especially for delegates and guests of
the financial discussions.
   Some protesters left after warnings by police but others refused
to go, witnesses said.
   A large contingent of helmeted police then moved in, swinging
their truncheons as demonstrators hurled rocks, the witnesses said.
   About 100 demonstrators ran to a square near West Berlin's famed
Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church where the violence continued.
   Some protesters were seen being hauled into police vans during
the two-hour battle. A police spokesman said he did not know how
many people had been arrested or injured.
   About 2,700 police from across West Germany have been sent to
West Berlin to help the city's 6,000-strong police force during the
week of financial talks.
   In talks today, the head of the International Monetary Fund
urged industrial nations to keep their economies expanding _ but
with low inflation _ to help ease the hardships suffered by the
heavily indebted poor countries.
   Michel Camdessus told the annual meeting that the rich countries
must be on guard against a fresh surge in prices.
   ``The central requirement is to avoid the return of inflationary
psychology,'' he said in a prepared text of his speech.
   Camdessus noted ``a few scattered warning signals,'' including
tightening labor markets in some countries and higher prices for
some commodities.
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, attending the first
international policy talks in his new job, also was scheduled to
speak today. Japan's central bank governor, Satoshi Sumita, was
expected to offer details of his country's proposal to help big
debtor countries like Brazil and Mexico.
   In his speech, Camdessus appealed to the United States to reduce
its government spending.
   ``''Fiscal restraint,'' he said, ``is currently warranted in
several countries, most notably the United States ...''
   ``A stronger budgetary position in the United States would also
help make exchange markets more resilient in the face of unexpected
developments,'' he said. ``And it would lower real interest rates,
with beneficial effects for indebted countries.''
   Camdessus applauded the industrial nations' decision to lighten
the money problems of the poorest debtor countries, mostly in
sub-Saharan Africa, and called on bankers and governments to do
more for the large debtors.
   World Bank President Barber Conable made an impassioned appeal
to wealthy countries to fight world poverty.
   ``Poverty on today's scale prevents a billion people from having
even minimally acceptable standards of living,'' he said in the
prepared text of his remarks.
   ``To allow every fifth human being on our planet to suffer such
an existence is a moral outrage,'' he said.
   The meeting is scheduled to last through Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is moving quickly to
exploit his high points from the presidential debate and distance
himself from the American Civil Liberties Union.
   At a rally Monday evening in downtown Journal Square, the
Democratic nominee said that during Sunday night's debate, his
Republican opponent George Bush ``suggested that I agree with every
position ever taken by the American Civil Liberties Union.''
   ``That's nonsense and he knows it,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Two months ago I signed one of the toughest child pornography
laws in the United States of America,'' he said. Meanwhile, his
staff passed out a ``fact sheet'' which said the ACLU has urged
repeal of all child pornography laws.
   ``I've always supported tax exemptions for religious
institutions,'' said Dukakis, ``and I certainly do not support
Oliver North who the ACLU is defending.''
   Dukakis' membership in the ACLU is one of the issues the
Republican nominee has raised in an effort to portray the
Massachusetts governor as a liberal out of the mainstream of
current thinking.
   During the debate, Bush referred to Dukakis as a ``card-carrying
member'' of the ACLU, described the group as a liberal organization
and attacked some of its positions.
   ``I don't want my 10-year-old granddaughter to go into an
X-rated movie,'' Bush said. ``I don't think they're right to try to
take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church. I don't want
to see the kiddie pornography laws repealed. I don't want to see
`Under God' come out from our currency. Now, these are all
positions of the ACLU and I don't agree with them.''
   ACLU officials accused Bush of distorting the organization's
positions and engaging in ``McCarthyite slander.'' ACLU president
Norman Dorsen said the group has consistently taken ``mainstream
positions'' intended to safeguard constitutional rights.
   The Dukakis campaign fact sheet said the ACLU has represented
people suing the Massachusetts governor's administration in an
effort to overturn its policies on drunk driving road blocks and a
regulation giving homosexuals low priority when seeking to become
foster parents.
   Dukakis campaign officials put together two new television
commercials showing excerpts from the debate.
   One of the 30-second commercials shows Dukakis talking about
college opportunity, health insurance and concluding, ``The best
America is not behind us. The best America is yet to come.''
   The second commercial is an excerpt from his closing statement.
People interviewed in focus groups after the debate resppnded very
favorably to his closing statement.
   Campaign aides said the commercials would run nationally on the
major television networks.
   At rallies in Ohio and New Jersey, Dukakis attacked Bush for
failing to talk about health insurance, college opportunity, Social
Security and Medicare.
   ``Mr. Bush offers the easy way,'' said the Democratic nominee.
``He sees no challenges; he offers no solutions, and he will lead
America nowhere as president of the United States.''
   He was campaigning today in another key industrial state _
Illinois _ with appearances in Peoria and Melrose Park, a suburb of
Chicago.
   When Dukakis landed at Newark Airport on Monday he got a look at
an airplane he hopes one day will be his to use, Air Force One.
President Reagan had flown into the same airport earlier en route
to address the United Nations.
   Dukakis was taking advantage of the presence of many world
leaders for the U.N. session.
   He was flying to New York on Wednesday to meet with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Before leaving the city the
following morning, Dukakis also planned to meet with French
President Francois Mitterand.
   The meetings are designed to help him counter arguments by the
Republicans that he lacks foreign policy experience.

   Four ``Simon and Simon'' stunt drivers turned
into real-life heroes when they chased a man straight to a police
station after he ran down an officer directing traffic during
filming of the TV show, authorities said.
   Samir Shamoun, 29, of Calabasas was arrested Monday after the
angry stunt drivers chased him at speeds up to 70 mph for more than
a mile to the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley station.
   ``It's a little ironic,'' said Officer Frank Nuckles. ``This guy
runs over a `blue suit' and then he runs to the police station for
safety.''
   Officer Dick Neuenschwander, 53, was struck while working
off-duty in a restaurant parking lot in the San Fernando Valley,
police said. He was in serious but stable condition at Northridge
Hospital.
   Witnesses said Shamoun, who worked near the filming site, got
angry when told him he couldn't drive through a parking lot
bustling with movie people.
   Shamoun appeared to decide to back up, but then the van lurched
forward, police Detective Don Bellante said. Neuenschwander fell
while trying to get out of the way and the van ran over his left
arm and leg.
   Four members of the ``Simon and Simon'' crew jumped into two
cars and chased the van as it fled the scene, Bellante said.
   ``He was getting away with running over a policeman,'' one of
the crew members, Gary Daily, said later. ``That's totally wrong.''
   One of the cars eventually cut in front of the van, forcing it
to a stop at the curb right in front of the police station,
Bellante said. All five men ran into the station where officers
stopped the fracas before anyone was injured, Bellante said.
   ``They came crashing through the front door of the station with
this donnybrook going,'' he said. ``Officers jumped over the desk
and grabbed them all until they could sort out who was who and what
was going on.''

   A former computer programmer on trial
for 16 murders was described by a prosecutor as a homosexual who
drove on Southern California roads for a decade, picking up young
hitchhikers and drugging, strangling and mutilating them.
   During his opening statement Monday, Orange County Deputy
District Attorney Bryan Brown pieced together the last hours of the
men Randy Kraft is charged with killing. Most were allegedly
hitchhikers picked up by Kraft in a car stocked with drugs and beer.
   ``This is a road map of what the evidence will show,'' Brown
told a Superior Court jury.
   Kraft, 43, has pleaded innocent to 16 counts of murder and
various other counts of mayhem and sodomy. His trial was delayed 12
times since his arrest more than five years ago. Prosecutors
believe they can link him to 21 other slayings and say the death
toll may be as high as 60.
   He has been jailed since May 14, 1983, when a California Highway
Patrol officer stopped him because his car was weaving and found a
dying Marine on the passenger seat.
   Authorities found what they believe was a coded ``score card''
of victims in the car, and 47 color photographs of several young
men, many of them nude and apparently posed after they were slain.
   The evidence shows Kraft would bind his drug-dazed victims,
choke them with a belt around the neck and have sex with them, the
prosecutor said.
   Many victims were mutilated before they were heaved from a
fast-moving car, Brown said.
   Kraft's fetish for saving mementos of victims and taking
post-death photographs was his undoing, Brown said.
   Defense attorney C. Thomas McDonald, who responded to the
Brown's two-hour statement with a 10-minute opening, warned jurors
against being swayed by vivid descriptions of the killings.
   ``These are tactics designed to inflame you,'' McDonald said.
``This is a tactical decision made by the prosecutor. He won't be
able to prove it. This case is based on suspicion, innuendo and
prosecutorial rhetoric.
   Brown detailed the deaths of the 16 victims, six of them Marines
and all age 18 to 25. The killings occurred between December 1972
and May 1983.

   Bishop Edward C. O'Leary, spiritual
leader of Maine's 278,000 Roman Catholics, is retiring because of
declining health, a spokesman for the statewide Diocese of Portland
said today.
   The 68-year-old bishop, who has headed the diocese since 1974,
planned to make the formal announcement at a news conference at the
Catholic chancery.
   O'Leary's decision was prompted by a decline in his overall
medical condition rather than any specific ailment, according to
Marc Mutty, director of communications for the diocese.
   ``The schedule is just too much for a man of his age,'' Mutty
said. ``He just does not think he can keep up with the pace it has
demanded.''
   The announcement followed word from the Vatican that Pope John
Paul II had accepted O'Leary's resignation, Mutty said, adding that
``nobody had any inkling of this before this morning.''
   Until a successor is named, O'Leary will serve as apostolic
administrator of the diocese, leaving him in charge but without the
authority to launch new initiatives, according to Mutty.
   It usually takes three to six months before a new bishop is
named, he said.
   A Bangor native, O'Leary was educated at Holy Cross College in
Worcester, Mass., and St. Paul's Seminary in Ottawa. He was
ordained a priest in 1946.

   Pipe-bomb killer Mark Hofmann
has been returned to Utah State Prison after 11 days in a hospital
for an overdose of an anti-depressant drug, officials said.
   Hofmann, 33, was released from the University of Utah Health
Sciences Center on Monday and taken to the prison's hospital unit,
officials said.
   Juan Benavidez of the Department of Corrections said an
investigation of the incident is expected to be complete in two
weeks. He had no information on the kind of drug, how Hofmann got
it and whether the inmate would be subject to disciplinary action.
   Hofmann is serving a five-years-to-life sentence for his guilty
pleas to a pair of 1985 pipe-bomb murders. He confessed to the
killings and said they were intended to mask his activities as the
forger of historical documents, many related to the Mormon Church.

   A jury early today convicted a man
described by a prosecutor as the ``head dog'' in a gang rape and
recommended that he get the maximum term of 20 years.
   Jurors deliberated about 20 minutes before returning with a
recommendation that Orlando Garza, 24, be given the maximum term
for his part as the alleged ringleader. He had also faced a fine of
up to $10,000 but there was no mention of a fine when the jury's
decision was annnounced.
   State District Judge Ricardo Garcia set sentencing for Oct. 17.
   There was little reaction from the defendant after the decision
was read. He declined comment after the court session ended and as
he left the Duval County Courthouse with his lawyers.
   Garza, the first of 10 defendants to stand trial in the case,
was accused of being the first man to sexually assault the
19-year-old woman on the night of March 26-27.
   The woman said as many as 23 men raped her after she was forced
to go to a ranch where illegal cockfights were being held near this
town of about 5,000 people south of Corpus Christi.
   A counselor who helped the woman at a sex abuse center said she
telephoned the victim, who has moved from here, to tell her about
the jury's verdict. ``She's happy,'' said counselor Barbara
Jackson. ``She said, `Thank the Lord.'''
   Garcia kept the jury late because he said he wanted the panel to
reach a verdict before he left for a judicial conference in Fort
Worth today.
   Jurors were told they could go home to get some rest and return
for the punishment phase of the trial, but they chose to continue.
   Defense attorneys urged that Garza get probation, but the
Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez asked jurors to
recommend the maximum sentence.
   The prosecutor said he believes that some of the other
defendants might want to plea bargain for shorter prison terms as a
result of Garza's sentence. The next trial in the case is scheduled
for next month.
   Final arguments began shortly before midnight before a courtroom
packed with more than 150 spectators. Jurors began their
deliberations at 2:15 a.m., returning the guilty verdict two hours
later.
   ``To me, it's devastating that a young woman placed herself in a
situation where something just extraordinary may have happened,''
defense attorney Albert Pena said in his final argument to the
six-man, six-woman jury.
   ``She went out there to that cockfight because she wanted to be
with this man here,'' said defense counsel Nago Alaniz, referring
to Garza.
   Alaniz said the woman fabricated the kidnapping and gang-rape
story to protect her reputation and keep her husband from finding
out about her illicit sexual activity with Garza, who said he had
been in an affair with the woman since January.
   Garza on Monday said the woman insisted on having sex with him
that night inside the car and later on the hood of the car, and
that she refused to leave the ranch when he tried to take her home.
   All 10 defendants pleaded innocent to charges ranging from
kidnapping to sexual assault.
   But Gutierrez said in his final argument that Garza ``was the
head dog. He was the one who brought the meat.''
   Assistant District Attorney Rocky Carrillo told the jury, ``You
all will have to determine if we have to reside in our county with
the likes of Orlando Garza.''
   The week-long trial featured testimony by the victim, her
husband and a 12-year-old boy present at the cockfight, who said
his family has moved to another city to escape harassment since he
presented himself as a witness.
   ``He was the only one who was man enough to come up here and
tell you the truth,'' Gutierrez said of the boy while addressing
the jury today.
   Garza also faces an aggravated kidnapping trial in the case.

<TEXT>
   Arab hospital officials today
confirmed the first two Palestinian deaths from plastic bullets,
and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin defended the use of the new
ammunition.
   The deaths followed criticism of the army's tactic of allowing
troops to fire plastic bullets more freely at Arab stone throwers.
A United Nations relief agency has protested what it said was a
sharp increase in injuries since the plastic bullets went into use.
   Rabin said plastic bullets were added to the soldiers' arsenal
in August after rubber bullets, tear gas and clubs ``proved to be
insufficient to cope'' with stone-throwing incidents linked to the
9-month-old uprising in the occupied territories.
   ``Those who participate in violent activities suffer more
casualties in terms of wounded,'' he told a news conference at a
military camp in Beit El, 12 miles north of Jerusalem. ``It did not
increase the number of people who are killed.''
   Rabin added: ``Our purpose is to increase the number (of
wounded) among those who take part in violent activities but not to
kill them.''
   Asked about the U.N. Relief and Works Agency protest, Rabin said
his job was to reduce violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. ``Other protests, with all due respect, are of secondary
importance to me,'' Rabin said.
   The first confirmed fatalities from plastic bullets were
identified by hospital officials as Osama Braikah, 17, of Khan
Yunis refugee camp, and Jihad Zanoun, 27, of Gaza City. Both are in
the Gaza Strip.
   Braikah was hit by two plastic bullets today during a
demonstration by dozens of stone-throwing protesters in his camp,
said Dr. Ahmed Yazejeh of Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. One bullet
hit his face, Yazejeh said, ``but a plastic bullet to the heart
killed him.''
   Yazejeh said he received the information from physicians at
Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, where Braikah was declared dead on
arrival. A spokesman at Nasser Hospital also confirmed the fatality
was caused by a plastic bullet.
   The other victim, Zanoun, died Monday after being struck in the
chest by a plastic bullet during clashes in Gaza City, according to
doctors at Shifa Hospital.
   The deaths raised to 276 the number of Palestinians killed since
the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8. Six Israelis have died.
   Violence in the occupied territories Monday left two other
Palestinians dead and 67 wounded. Today, at least 10 Palestinians
were wounded in clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank and
Gaza, eight with plastic bullets and two with live ammunition,
hospital officials said.
   Army spokesmen have contended plastic bullets, which penetrate
the body with less force than live ammunition, are not lethal
unless fired from less than 20 yards' distance.
   Also today, Israeli warplanes attacked Shiite Moslem guerrilla
bases in south Lebanon. The army said at least two jet fighters
took part in the attack on bases belonging to Hezbollah, an
Iranian-backed Shiite faction.
   There were no immediate reports on casualties.
   The attacks near the Lebanese village of Al-Luwayzah appeared to
be a warning to Shiite extremists following the assassinations last
week of three moderate Lebanese leaders.
   An army spokesman said the target of today's air raid was
guerrilla headquarters for planning and executing attacks against
Israeli forces and Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen in Israel's
self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon.
   It was the 15th air strike against guerrilla targets in Lebanon
this year.
   Israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in June 1985
after a three-year occupation but maintains a six-to-10-mile wide
buffer zone north of the Israeli border.

   Michael Dukakis, refining his plan to break
the Republican Electoral College lock, plans to curtail his efforts
in several states that appear out of reach while escalating the
fight for critical swing states and the major battleground of
Texas, according to campaign aides.
   In all, the states in which Dukakis aides concede their chances
of defeating Republican nominee George Bush are slim carry roughly
100 of the 538 possible Electoral College votes, with 270 needed to
win the White House.
   One Dukakis aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
campaign would begin ``pulling back budget and pulling back staff''
and saving the resources for states that are closer to Dukakis'
reach.
   ``Decisions are being made about every state, about where it's
best to schedule visits and where it would be more productive for
us to be spending time and money,'' another aide said. ``Clearly
there are certain places where we would be better off dedicating
our resources.''
   Considered high among those is Texas, with 29 electoral votes
and where Bush currently holds a lead in the polls. Dukakis and his
running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, plan an aggressive campaign
there, including ads asking what Bush has done for his adopted home
state and highlighting Bentsen's Texas ties, said a third aide.
   Two of the advisers pointed to Dukakis' recent travel schedule
as evidence of the refined strategy and said it was a good
barometer for states considered competitive.
   ``The governor is committed to a 50-state campaign and so are
we, but we all understand what drives a schedule and we are working
on it together to make the sound strategic decisions,'' said one of
them.
   By that measure, most of the South and Rocky Mountain states
appear to have been de-emphasized.
   Dukakis has campaigned extensively in Texas, and will return
there this week, but he has visited Florida, which has 21 electoral
votes, only once in the past several weeks. He has visited
Mississippi and Virginia one time each, briefly, and has not been
to South Carolina. Dukakis made two stops in Alabama several weeks
ago but has not returned. He has not visited Georgia since the
Democratic convention in July, although he is expected to do so in
the next few weeks in an effort to keep the race competitive there.
   In contrast, he has been to Arkansas and Kentucky at least twice
since the convention, and aides say those states, along with
Tennessee, North Carolina and Louisiana, are considered more
competitive, as is Missouri.
   Turning West, Dukakis strategists concede they have little hope
for carrying traditionally Republican Alaska, Utah, Idaho, Nevada,
Wyoming, and Arizona, as well as Kansas and Nebraska in the farm
belt, GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle's home state of
Indiana and New Hampshire.
   The Dukakis aides say they will not outright concede any state
but, with six weeks to go before the election, must make decisions
on where best to allocate staff and money. If internal tracking
shows a significant shift among voters in any of the states now
being de-emphasized, the plan could again be revised, the aides
said.
   ``We track this stuff very carefully and will be ready to
respond if we see a new opportunity somewhere,'' said one aide
involved in targeting decisions. ``By keeping it competitive, if we
can, we keep the Republicans spending time and resources. You see
where we are by looking at the schedule but that doesn't mean we
don't keep targets of opportunity open.''
   If paid staffers are relocated, the campaign will rely on
volunteers to maintain a presence in all 50 states, that aide said.
   The current plan is to target two of the largest electoral
prizes, California and Texas, and the traditionally Democratic
states in the Northeast and industrial Midwest. The race in many of
those states is very tight, another factor in decisions to
reallocate resources, the aides said.
   New York, which ranks second only to California in electoral
votes, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan carry a total
of 179 votes, and Dukakis hopes to win most of them and offset any
losses with victories in the border states.
   Despite the decision to de-emphasize some states, Dukakis aides
are convinced they can break the GOP electoral lock by reclaiming
the Northeast and industrial Midwest and picking up the rest of the
needed votes from other states that supported President Reagan in
the last two elections.
   ``Whether it's in the border states or the far West, it's clear
that it's very different this time,'' said one aide. ``The
opportunity is clearly there.''

<HEAD>Reagan Says He Would Never Deny US Advisers in El Salvador Right
to Defend Selves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, asked about a firefight
involving guerrillas and U.S. military advisers in El Salvador,
said today he would never deny the advisers ``the right to defend
themselves.''
   In the incident two weeks ago, the U.S. advisers to the
Salvadoran army found themselves in the middle of a rebel attack on
an army headquarters, the Pentagon said.
   Maj. Kathy Wood, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said that the advisers
``fired in self defense'' and that none was injured.
   ``They were caught in the middle of a fire fight and their own
lives were in jeopardy, so they fired in self defense,'' she said.
   Reagan, asked about the incident during a picture-taking session
with NATO leaders in New York, replied, ``I'll never send any of
our people into danger without allowing them the right to defend
themselves if they are attacked.''
   The Washington Post and the Miami Herald in editions today
quoted a Defense Department memorandum as saying 16 Salvadoran
soldiers and five guerrillas were killed in the assault at the
Salvadoran Army's 4th Brigade headquarters in north central El
Salvador.
   Here is how the memorandum described the action, according to
the published reports:
   ``During the attack, the U.S. personnel positioned themselves in
a sandbagged and reinforced bunker position adjacent to the trainer
quarters. From this position, the U.S. personnel could observe
guerrillas moving about surrounding high ground and firing their
weapons at, or in the general direction of, the U.S. personnel.
   ``Perceiving a direct threat to their safety, the U.S. personnel
engaged the guerrillas with their assigned personal weapons.''
   It was not known specifically whether the three U.S. soldiers
killed anyone. They reportedly returned fire with M-16 rifles.
   ``There are no indications of guerrilla casualties as a result
of the U.S. defensive fire,'' the Post quoted Lt. Gen. Charles W.
Brown, director of the Defense Security Assistance Agency, as
writing in the memo.
   The encounter occurred Sept. 13, but word of it surfaced Monday
because the Defense Department referred to it in a report it is
required to send to Congress whenever a hostile action in El
Salvador involves an American, the spokeswoman said Monday.
   She said she had not seen the memo referred to in the published
reports.
   The same Salvadoran army headquarters was the site of a fierce
gun and mortar battle in late March 1987, resulting in the death of
a U.S. Army sergeant.
   Army Sgt. Gregory Fronius, 27, an intelligence specialist who
was advising the Salvadoran army, is the only soldier reported
killed while on duty in the midst of combat during the eight years
of civil war in the country. U.S. military advisers arrived in the
country in 1981.
   Fronius was one of two advisers assigned to the camp at the time
of the 1987 attack. The other U.S. soldier was away.

   A young man accused in a school shooting
spree that left an 8-year-old girl dead and 10 people wounded had
been in and out of a hospital psychiatric ward over the past eight
months, relatives said.
   James William Wilson, who was arrested following Monday's
violence at Oakland Elementary School, is a hyperactive recluse
fascinated by crime stories, his father and a grandmother said.
   The 19-year-old Greenwood man entered the school shortly after
11 a.m. Monday and opened fire in a classroom and the cafeteria,
killing Shequila Tawonn Bradley and wounding two teachers and eight
pupils, said Police Chief James Coursey.
   ``He seemed to be shooting people who were screaming,'' said
School Superintendent Robert S. Watson. ``The teacher said those
who were screaming or making noise, he shot them.''
   The school in this city of about 20,000 people in South
Carolina's textile belt 74 miles northwest of Columbia remained
closed today.
   Authorities had no motive for the shooting, said Coursey.
   At an arraignment this morning, city Recorder Ted Windham denied
bond on the murder charge. Retired state Supreme Court Justice
Bruce Littlejohn, acting as a special judge, ordered Wilson sent to
Columbia for psychiatric examation.
   Wilson had been admitted to Self Memorial Hospital's psychiatric
ward three or four times in the past eight months, his father,
James Wilson, and paternal grandmother, Gladys Wilson, said in
interviews with The State newspaper.
   They said he had not returned more recently because the family's
medical insurance ran out.
   The hefty, 5-foot-5 man, who is known as ``Jamie,'' is bright
and shy, and doesn't have many friends, they said.
   ``He was hyperactive, really more than hyperactive,'' Mrs.
Wilson said.
   James William Wilson said he liked going to the hospital because
they gave him drugs, his father said, adding that until two months
ago the young man had been taking medication for depression.
   The young man was not employed. He ``just didn't have the
ability,'' his father said.
   His parents divorced last year. Wilson had been living with his
grandmother off and on since he was 14 and permanently the last two
yars.
   He would keep himself sequestered in his bedroom and surrounded
by books, Mrs. Wilson said. ``He kept the blinds closed. He liked
it to be dark,'' she said.
   Lately, he'd been reading numerous crime books, she said.
   His father, a welder, said he first learned of his son's arrest
when he returned home from work Monday. ``It just doesn't make no
sense,'' he said.
   The wounded teachers, Kat Finkbeiner and Eleanor Hodge, were
listed in fair condition today at Self Memorial. A 7-year-old pupil
was in critical condition and another was in fair condition.
   Six other pupils were treated for superficial gunshot wounds and
released Monday, said hospital spokesman Dan Branyon.
   Shequila died of a gunshot wound to the neck, said Greenwood
County Coroner Odell Duvall.
   ``There would have been a great deal more injury and loss of
life if it had not been for these brave teachers and the way they
conducted themselves,'' said State Law Enforcement Division chief
Robert Stewart.
   Coursey said Wilson walked through the school's front door, went
to the cafeteria and opened fire with a .22-caliber, nine-shot
revolver, wounding one teacher and three students.
   He left the cafeteria and entered a girl's restroom to reload
his weapon. Ms. Finkbeiner followed and attempted to prevent him
from leaving the room, Coursey said.
   In the scuffle that followed, Ms. Finkbeiner was shot in the
mouth and hand.
   Wilson evaded Ms. Finkbeiner and entered a classroom, where he
opened fire again, wounding five students and killing Shequila,
Coursey said.
   After emptying his pistol, Wilson dropped the weapon. Ms.
Finkbeiner told him to raise his hands and stand until a police
officer arrived, the chief said.
   Watson said he knew of no connection between the gunman and the
school.
   ``It appears to be an entirely random incident,'' Watson said.
   Officials will try to help students and teachers recover from
the nightmare, Watson said. The district will provide teachers with
counseling today, he said, and children will receive counseling
when they return Wednesday.

<HEAD>High Failure Rate On Exam Could Add To Shortage, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health industry officials fear that the
high failure rate of people who took the national nursing exam in
July foretells a worsening in an already serious nursing shortage.
   ``We're in a real bind,'' said Bill Massie, chief operating
officer of the University of Kentucky's Albert B. Chandler Medical
Center, where 29 of 73 nursing graduates hired over the summer
failed the test.
   Nursing-school graduates can work as registered nurses until
their test results arrive, but those who fail lose their positions.
   Nationally, 16.4 percent of individuals who took the two-day
exam for the first time in July failed, said Carolyn Yocom,
director of research services for the National Council of State
Boards of Nursing, which prepares the exam.
   Partly because of changes in the test and the way it is scored,
that is the highest failure rate since the council started the exam
in 1982, she said. Last year, only 9 percent of first-time test
takers failed, and in previous years the failure rate ranged from 8
percent to 12 percent, Yocom said.
   The failure rate increased in all 50 states, she said. In
Kentucky, then failure rate was about 20 percent of first-time test
takers, up from 10 prcemt last year, said Patricia Calico,
president of the Kentucky Board of Nursing.
   ``This just exacerbates the (shortage) problem,'' said Michael
Rush, vice president for member services of the Kentucky Hospital
Association. A survey it did in 1987 found that one in 10
registered-nurse positions in Kentucky hospitals was unfilled.
   The UK Medical Center has closed three intensive-care-unit beds
because it didn't have enough nurses, Massie said.
   Carolyn A. Williams, dean of the University of Kentucky School
of Nursing, said she worries that the bad results will scare young
people away from a nursing career.
   This year's test has been changed to cover new subjects because
of the changing skills and knowledge required of entry-level
nurses, Yocom said.
   Also, the number of correct answers needed to pass the test was
increased, but by fewer than 10 out of the total of 300 questions
asked, she said. The Chicago-based council won't reveal how many
correct answers are needed to pass the test.
   Yocom said the council expected the failure rate to increase,
but not by as much as it did, and said changes in the exam
accounted for only half the increase.
   She theorized that increasing opportunities for women in other
professions, night and weekend hours in many health-care settings,
and non-competitive salaries have prompted fewer top-quality people
to enter nursing.
   The Kentucky Board of Nursing has asked the national council to
offer the exam three times a year instead of the current two so
nurses can get into the work force more quickly. The next scheduled
exam is in February, and by the time those results come out the
nurses who failed in July but pass in February will not be able to
start work as registered nurses until about April.

<HEAD>Security Forces Find Huge Arsenal Of Terrorist Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces found a large
arsenal of weapons, including a Soviet-made rocket launcher, hidden
in underground bunkers, police said today.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said ``a number of people'' were
arrested for questioning about the caches, discovered on Monday and
today around Strabane, County Tyrone, near Northern Ireland's
northwest border with the Irish Republic.
   ``Security forces have found a huge arsenal of terrorist
weapons,'' a police statement said.
   The haul included a Soviet RPG-7 rocket launcher and two
warheads, more than 1,000 pounds of homemade explosives, two
Soviet-made AKM assault rifles, one shotgun, a large quantity of
ammunition and detonators, explosive fuses and propellant charges,
police said.
   The arms were concealed in 40-gallon drums that had been welded
together and buried in elaborately constructed bunkers under a
hillside, police said.
   ``It is obvious that people within our community were fully
aware of the presence of these caches,'' said a police spokesman,
who requested anonymity. ``Where human life is being taken so
frequently it is long past time that those who are aware of such
activity should act more responsibly.''
   The spokesman urged citizens to report any information about
terrorist activities or arms so that ``lives can be saved.''
   Last week, Sir John Hermon, head of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, said the outlawed Irish Republican Army ``has very
considerable quantities of very powerful weaponry which they have
not yet used,'' including surface-to-air missiles.
   Libya is believed to have supplied the weapons to the IRA for
its fight to oust the British from Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland and unite the province with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish
Republic.
   This year a series of IRA attacks in Northern Ireland, mainland
Britain and continental Europe have killed 27 British soldiers and
11 guerrillas. Since November, 20 civilians have died in bungled
IRA operations.

<HEAD>Sugar-Based Chemicals May One Day Prevent Plaque, Scientist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laboratory studies suggest chemicals that
tantalize the sweet tooth may actually help prevent cavities, says
a chemist who hopes to develop a tooth-protecting sugar substitute.
   The chemicals are derived from table sugar and are called
``glucans mimics'' because they imitate glucans, a sticky substance
that is the major component of plaque, which adheres to teeth to
cause cavities.
   Laboratory studies showed that the chemicals took the place of
real glucans to block the plaque-forming activity of enzymes
produced by bacteria found in the human mouth, University of
Louisville chemist K. Grant Taylor said Monday during the American
Chemical Society's national meeting.
   Although the chemicals haven't yet been tested in animals or
people and are not yet able to permanently block the cavity-causing
enzymes, similar substances might be developed for use in
commercial toothpaste and mouthwashes. That would probably take
about eight years ``under the best circumstances,'' Taylor said.
   If an intensely sweet plaque-preventing compound can be
developed, ``you can use it as a sugar substitute,'' he said.
   An American Chemical Society news release called Taylor's
research ``a major step toward preventing cavity-causing dental
plaque,'' but other scientists were more cautious.
   ``It's basic research, and we can't tell how long before
something may come to fruition,'' said Dr. Joseph Ciardi, a cavity
research program administrator at the National Institute for Dental
Research in Bethesda, Md.
   ``This is all test-tube work,'' said Dr. Erwin Barrington,
periodontics professor at the University of Illinois School of
Dentistry in Chicago. ``Something that works in the lab isn't
necessarily going to work on an animal, be it a human or laboratory
animal,''
   The method now used to stop plaque from causing cavities is to
remove the material by brushing and flossing teeth and using mouth
rinses to help break down plaque to ease removal, Barrington said.
   Bacteria in the mouth use their own enzymes and sugar in food to
make glucans. More food particles and bacteria then stick to the
glucans to form plaque. Sugars in the food are converted to acid,
which dissolves tooth enamel and damages material beneath the
enamel to create cavities.
   Taylor said his studies focused on finding or making glucans
mimics, which are artificial forms of glucans.
   In the test-tube experiments, glucans mimics hooked onto the
decay-causing bacteria, preventing real glucans from doing so,
Taylor said. That prevented the bacteria from making chemicals that
give plaque its structure, he said.
   Taylor and his colleagues said they have found or developed
different chemicals that mimic glucans. They include synthetic
chemicals derived from table sugar, hydrogen peroxide and vitamin
B6.
   Glucans-mimicking chemicals also are ``a lot more expensive than
flouride, which is fairly effective in reducing cavities,'' he
said. If scientists develop such chemicals that prevent plaque in
humans, they may be economical only for people who suffer a
condition in which flouride harms rather than protects their teeth,
Taylor added.
   The chemistry group said Americans now spend about $16 billion a
year for the diagnosis and treatment of cavities.

<HEAD>Christian Cabinet Announces Army Shakeup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, head of
Lebanon's Christian Cabinet, fired four colonels today in a shakeup
aimed at purging supporters of former President Amin Gemayel.
   Aoun, whose appointment as prime minister last Thursday pushed
the country closer to formal partition, also reportedly banned
helicopter flights to and from the U.S. Embassy in suburban Beirut.
   The east Beirut daily newspaper Ad-Diyar said the embassy was
told U.S. helicopters may only land or take off from the army base
in Adma, six miles north of the embassy compound. The report could
not be confirmed immediately.
   Police, meanwhile, said three bombs exploded in Syrian-policed
Moslem west Beirut on Monday, wounding one civilian and destroying
several shops and cars.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the blasts, the sixth
and seventh bombings in west Beirut since Gemayel named Aoun prime
minister.
   The military shakeup, apparently aimed at consolidating Aoun's
power within the army, brought his most trusted aides to top
military posts. The shakeup preceded the first meeting of Aoun's
Cabinet, which Gemayel appointed before his six-year term ended at
midnight Thursday.
   Aoun's government has been rejected by the Moslem majority,
which recognizes ony the Cabinet of acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, a Sunni Moslem.
   Aoun today issued a directive dismissing Col. Simon Kassis, head
of the army's intelligence branch, and appointed Col. Amer Shehab
to replace him.
   The general also dismissed the commander of the presidential
guards, Col. Louis Kassis. He was replaced by Col. Francois Zein.
Maj. Fuad Ashkar was appointed head of the army's security
apparatus, replacing Col. George Shahwan.
   Col. Mohammed Zaidan, the only Moslem among the four men
dismissed today, was fired from his post as head of the army's
strategic planning branch. Aoun did not name his successor.
   Maronite Christians have dominated power since Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943, holding the presidency, the army
command, the Central Bank governorship and the chairmanship of the
Supreme Court.
   But under an unwritten covenant, prime ministers have been Sunni
Moslems and parliament speakers have been Shiite Moslems.
   Aoun, a Christian, took over after Parliament failed repeatedly
to muster the needed quorum of 51 deputies to convene and elect a
successor to Gemayel.
   The Moslem officers named to serve in Aoun's six-man military
Cabinet refused to take up their posts, leaving the general with
only two ministers in addition to himself.

<HEAD>Methodist Minister In Soweto Detained By Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police detained a Methodist
minister today in an early morning raid, claiming he violated a ban
on calls for an election boycott, his wife and church colleagues
said.
   The Rev. Tom Mbanane of Soweto was taken into custody as the
Methodist and Roman Catholic churches released the text of pastoral
letters urging their followers to consider refusing to vote in the
Oct. 26 nationwide municipal elections.
   Agnes Mbabane said her 55-year-old husband was taken from his
home in the black township at 12:45 a.m. by officers who alleged he
had preached against participation in the October elections.
   Mrs. Mbabane said her husband had not advocated an election
boycott but had conveyed the Methodist Church's appeal to its
congregations to consider carefully whether they should vote.
   Mbabane is a regional vice chairman of the Methodist Church. The
chairman of his district, the Rev. Peter Storey, said in a
statement: ``The authorites must have taken leave of their senses
to remove someone of Mr. Mbabane's stature and integrity from
Soweto at this tense time.''
   The pastoral letter from Methodist leaders said abstention from
voting would be the only way for some voters to convey their
rejection of apartheid.
   ``Only candidates who are openly and sincerely committed to the
complete abolition of apartheid are worthy of Christian support,''
the letter said.
   A similar letter issued by the Southern African Catholic Bishops
Conference said the elections could further entrench apartheid.
   The elections will mark the first time South Africans of all
races go to the polls the same day. Most anti-apartheid activists
oppose participation in segregated local elections as long as the
black majority is excluded from full participation in national
elections.
   Numerous activist clergymen, including Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, have defied a state-of-emergency regulation
forbidding calls for an election boycott.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a range of statements the
government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has
not been comprehensive.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.

   Republican George Bush boasted today that
he's successfully pasted a liberal label on Democratic rival
Michael Dukakis and declared that ``I'm going to keep on using it''
in their tight campaign race for the White House.
   Bush also told several thousand students at a Young College
Republicans rally on the University of Miami campus that Dukakis is
inexperienced in foreign affairs.
   ``America doesn't need a president who has to enroll in Foreign
Policy 101 to understand the kind of world we live in,'' the vice
president said.
   Bush asked, ``How did I do?'' in his nationally televised debate
with Dukakis on Sunday, and the reply was a roar of approval from
the crowd.
   About three dozen protesters waving pro-Dukakis signs and
chanting ``Where Was George?'' were kept several hundred feet away
and out of earshot from the platform where the GOP nominee spoke.
   Bush said he was successful in portraying Dukakis during the
debate as a liberal who stands far to the left of most Americans.
``We smoked him out,'' he said.
   ``For most of the campaign the man I call the stealth candidate
has tried to hide where he stands,'' Bush said.
   The vice president said Dukakis didn't like it when Bush used
``the big L word,'' referring to the word liberal. ``I'm going to
keep on using it,'' Bush said.
   ``He's just itching to spend money and he wants to set the clock
back to those days of misery and malaise, and I'm not going to let
him do it,'' Bush said.
   Expanding on that theme, the vice president criticized the
Massachusetts governor Monday for his membership in the American
Civil Liberties Union during campaign stops in the South.
   Aides said Bush would drive the point home today on a tour that
also took him to a Republican convention in Columbus, Ohio, and a
rally at Owensboro. Ky. Bush planned Wednesday to take an
eight-hour bus trip through Illinois.
   ``My values are your values and they are not the values of the
ACLU,'' Bush told a rally and barbecue on Monday at a farm in
Hampton, Ga., near Atlanta.
   He spoke as Dukakis, at a campaign appearance in Jersey City,
said he did not agree with all positions taken by the civil
liberties' organization ``and he (Bush) knows it.''
   Dukakis stressed his support for tough laws against child
pornography, his support for tax exemptions for churches and other
charitable organizations, and his opposition to the ACLU's support
of former White House aide Oliver North, a key figure in the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   Bush aides voiced delight with what they viewed as Dukakis'
squirming on the issue. ``My advice to him is, make my day, come
south,'' said Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater, predicting the
ACLU issue would loom even larger in the days to come in the South
and other conservative rural areas.
   Meanwhile, Bush says he thinks his Sunday night showdown with
the Democratic presidential nominee was probably a draw _
contradicting an array of senior aides who crowned him the clear
victor.
   ``I kind of thought it was even,'' Bush told reporters.
   However, he also said he thought the debate ``turned out pretty
well.''
   At a joint appearance in Jackson, Tenn., with GOP vice
presidential candiate Dan Quayle, Bush voiced strong praise for his
running mate and urged supporters to ``stay tuned'' for next week's
vice presidential debate in which he predicted Quayle would do well.
   Quayle declared Bush the winner of the debate, which he called
``the nice man versus the ice man'' and said Dukakis would have
been ``better off to take advice from his friends at the ACLU and
exercised his right to remain silent.''
   Over and over, Bush and his lieutenants drove home the ACLU
issue.
   In particular, Bush in his Georgia speech accused the
organization of opposing penalties for distributing child
pornography and of advocating the legalization of drugs ``including
crack and heroin.''
   ``I don't think that is the American way,'' Bush said. ``It is
not my way. It is the way of the ACLU.''
   In the same speech, Bush said that, ``To wrap up that Democratic
nomination, he (Dukakis) had to stay where he's been in his entire
political life _ and that is on the left side of things. And now
he's trying to move back and pre-empt the mainstream in the
middle.''
   ``I will not let him do that. I'm going to make him be what he
is, not what he wants to be,'' Bush added.

   Aung Gyi, a retired army officer who broke
with strongman Ne Win and became the country's leading dissident,
today was named chairman of a newly formed opposition alliance.
   The alliance urged workers to continue a general strike until
they achieved their goal of democracy. The strike began Sept. 18
when Gen. Saw Maung seized power in a military coup.
   In another development, the government said today that 348
people had been killed in Burma since the coup. Western diplomats
in Rangoon estimated earlier that as many as 400 people were killed
by the government in the days following the coup.
   Government spokesman Kyaw Sann told a press briefing that 219
others had been wounded and 1,107 arrested by authorities.
   Widespread rioting broke out when Saw Maung seized power, and
the general immediately ordered troops into the streets to quell
the protests.
   The government spokesman also said rebels of the Burma Communist
Party have launched major attacks against army outposts in
northeastern Burma, killing 44 government soldiers and wounding 92.
The fighting, said to be continuing in some areas, involved both
government air strikes and fierce infantry clashes with bayonets.
   The spokesman for the opposition alliance said another former
military officer, Tin Oo, was named vice chairman of the League for
Democracy while Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of a revered Burmese
independence hero, was chosen general secretary.
   The three figures formed the league Saturday and immediately
called on all citizens to join in a peaceful struggle against the
new military regime.
   The alliance marks the first formal opposition attempt to unify
under one leadership the millions of students, Buddhist monks,
workers and professionals who have taken to the streets over the
past two months to demand an end to 26 years of repressive
one-party rule.
   The new opposition league demands than an interim government be
created to lead Burma out of chaos.
   ``We still believe that an interim government is the only way to
solve the present crisis in the country ... to revive stalled
government, to reactivate the broken-down economy and to hold
genuine, free and fair general elections,'' Aung Gyi said today.
   The alliance also named nine members of a 12-member executive
committee. The three remaining positions are to be filled later by
representatives of Burma's numerous ethnic minorities, who are also
fighting the government.
   The alliance later will elect a 37-member governing body, which
will include one representative from each of the seven states where
ethnic minorities predominate _ Arakan, Chin, Kachin, Shan, Kayah,
Karen and Mon.
   The 70-year-old Aung Gyi earlier this year circulated a series
of letters to former leader Ne Win, criticizing the government's
economic performance and its brutal suppression of student
demonstrations last March.
   Aung Gyi, who broke with Ne Win in 1963 over economic policy,
was jailed for several years in the 1960s and again briefly this
summer when hardliner Sein Lwin assumed power after Ne Win resigned.
   Tin Oo, 61, was removed by Ne Win as defense and army chief in
1976 and was later jailed in connection with an alleged
anti-government plot.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, 42, is the daughter of the late Aung San, the
much revered hero of Burmese independence from Great Britain. She
had been living in Britain but returned to Rangoon for a visit
earlier this year and stayed to campaign for democracy.
   Analysts say the three, who had trouble cooperating in the past,
were pressed to unite by the bloody crackdown on dissent following
Saw Maung's coup.
   Since the coup, demonstrations have ceased in Rangoon and some
students have fled to the rugged frontier with Thailand to seek
refuge with ethnic minority insurgents.
   On Monday, top officials appealed to parents and teachers to
stop the students from linking up with the rebels.

   Canadian Ben Johnson left the Olympics
today ``in a complete state of shock,'' accused of cheating with
drugs in the world's fastest 100-meter dash and stripped of his
gold medal. The prize went to American Carl Lewis.
   Many athletes accepted the accusation that Johnson used a
muscle-building but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called
stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been
going on in track and field.
   ``Everybody uses drugs,'' said sprinter Horace Dove-Edwin of
Sierra Leone. ``Give me a break ... they have everything. Human
blood hormone, all kinds of drugs. Steroids is nothing anymore. It
is just an itty-bitty drug. You can get it anywhere.''
   Red-eyed and visibly distraught, Johnson's sister, Clare Rodney
in suburban Toronto, refused to believe the accusation.
   ``If you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over
again, my brother is not on drugs,'' she said.
   Two tests of Johnson's urine sample proved positive and his
denials of drug use were rejected today.
   Neither a spiked sarsparilla in his track bag, as his coach
suggested, nor a switched sample at the lab could have accounted
for the levels of steroids found in the tests, officials said.
   In a middle-of-the-night meeting with Olympic and Canadian
officials, family members, coach and manager, Johnson, 26,
forfeited his most prized possession, the medal he'd had in his
hands for only three days.
   The world's fastest human also was automatically suspended from
international competition for two years and banned from Canada's
national team for life.
   ``He appeared to be in a complete state of shock and not
comprehending the situation,'' said Canada's chief of mission,
Carol Anne Letheren. ``Ben was not able to discuss or articulate
anything at that moment ... He was just not able to speak and it
was a very difficult moment for all of us.''
   A few hours later, he fled to the airport and boarded a plane to
New York's Kennedy International Airport. Once there, he made his
way through a crush of reporters without comment as some spectators
applauded. He took a limousine to LaGuardia Airport for a flight to
his Toronto home.
   ``This is a blow for the Olympic Games and the Olympic
movement,'' said International Olympic Committee President Juan
Antonio Samaranch.
   In Canada, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the scandal was a
``personal tragedy for Ben and his family. It's also a moment of
great sorrow for all Canadians.''
   James Worrall, a Canadian member of the IOC, said Johnson ``has
been killed'' as an athlete. He said the sprinter's once-favored
status as a hero to many sports fans in Canada, his native Jamaica,
and around the world now will be tarnished.
   Johnson's name will go down in Olympic history with other
athletes who lost their gold medals, such as decathlete Jim Thorpe
in 1912 because he played semi-pro baseball and swimmer Rick DeMont
in 1972 because he took an asthma medicine.
   Lewis did not gloat over his rival's fall. ``I feel sorry for
Ben and for the Canadian people,'' he said today. ``Ben is a great
competitor and I hope he is able to straighten out his life and
return to competition.''
   He said he did not want ``to fuel this controversy'' by
commenting further.
   After Saturday's race, though, Lewis had said he couldn't
understand how Johnson could run as fast as he did after looking
tired in qualifying heats. Lewis has previously alleged widespread
drug use in track and field.
   Dr. Robert Dugal, a Canadian member of the IOC medical
commission, called stanozolol ``one of the most dangerous anabolic
steroids. It has the effect of leading to a number of disturbances
of the liver, including cancer.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules That Hatcher Is His Own Attorney</HEAD>

   A federal judge ruled that an American
Indian accused of hostage-taking must act as his own attorney, a
decision the man's lawyer called a ``disgrace.''
   Eddie Hatcher's trial opened Monday but his lawyer, William
Kunstler, was in New York at a trial expected to last until
mid-October.
   ``The court is ready to proceed and will proceed with this
trial,'' U.S. District Court Judge Terrence Boyle said after
Hatcher declined to be represented in court by two attorneys other
than Kunstler.
   ``Mr. Hatcher has chosen to defend himself,'' Boyle announced.
   ``No, your honor, I have had that decision forced on me against
my constitutional rights,'' Hatcher replied.
   Jury selection in the trial continued today. By midmorning,
Boyle had questioned 43 jurors and excused 15, including two who
said they were ``unalterably in favor'' of Hatcher and the trial's
other defendant, Timothy Jacobs. Both potential jurors said they
had some American Indian ancestry.
   Hatcher, 31, and Jacobs, 20, are charged with taking up to 20
hostages and possessing illegal firearms in a 10-hour siege at The
Robesonian newspaper office Feb. 1 in Lumberton.
   The hostages were released unharmed when Gov. Jim Martin agreed
to appoint a state task force to investigate the defendants'
allegations of drug trafficking and racial discrimination among
county law enforcement officials. No evidence of drug trafficking
has been found.
   The trial opened with Jacobs at one table with his three lawyers
and their two staff members, while Hatcher sat alone at another
table.
   Before jury selection could start, a Chapel Hill law professor
who is counseling Hatcher, Barry Nakell, argued that the trial
should be delayed until Kunstler, a prominent attorney known for
his defense of leftist causes, could be in the courtroom.
   Boyle denied the request. Then the federal judge ruled that an
associate of Kunstler's who was present, Stephanie Moore, would be
Hatcher's trial attorney, despite Ms. Moore's argument that she was
representing Hatcher only before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   Ms. Moore refused to participate in the trial and walked out of
the courtroom just before the lunch recess. In court after the
break, Boyle asked Hatcher if he would accept either Ms. Moore or
Nakell as his trial attorney.
   ``Mr. Hatcher, do you want to fire Mr. Nakell or keep him?''
Boyle asked. Hatcher replied, ``Bill Kunstler is my attorney, and I
feel like I'm being forced to make this decision, and my
constitutional rights are being violated.''
   Kunstler criticized the federal judge, saying it was ``a
disgrace'' for a federal judge to deny a defendant the counsel of
his choice and calling the decision ``a wicked and misleading
charade.''

Picks up graf 11 pvs, `On Monday ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today called on the
United States to join Moscow in creating a World Space
Organization, which would use a disputed Siberian radar base as its
eye on the heavens.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev suggested earlier this month
that the Soviet radar base at Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, be turned over
to an international agency for the peaceful exploration of space.
   The United States says the radar base violates the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and must be demolished.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in his
speech today to the General Assembly that the United States should
join the Soviets in the space agency and donate U.S. radar units in
Greenland and Britain.
   Shevardnadze said the latest Soviet diplomatic initiative was
sincere, and that he wanted to make the United Nations a ``unique
global center for ensuring universal and regional security, and the
security of each country.''
   The Western allies, which regard the Soviet proposal as a new
organizational plan that would replace the U.N. Charter, are
reluctant to tinker with the existing structure of the world body.
   Last year, the Soviets were unable to win a majority of votes in
the General Assembly when they introduced the plan as a resolution.
   Shevardnadze also said the U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap all
intermediate-range nuclear missiles should be supplemented by an
agreement limiting the spread of military missile technology that
``could be worked out only under the auspices of the United
Nations.''
   On conventional arms, the Soviet diplomat suggested the United
Nations register all conventional arms sales and transfers.
   Shevardnadze called for an expanded role for the Security
Council, suggesting periodic meetings of its foreign ministers and
that it meet in areas of regional tensions.
   In the last 18 months, increased U.S.-Soviet cooperation has
allowed the Security Council to act unanimously on major issues
including the Persian Gulf peace plan in Resolution 598, and in
denouncing the use of chemical weapons in the gulf war.
   Turning to Afghanistan, Shevardnadze said ``the Geneva accords
are not just an isolated local instance of a regional conflict
settlement. ... They are a new promising beginning in world
politics, attesting to a qualitative change in poltiical thinking.''
   Under those U.N.-mediated accords, Soviet troops are to be out
of Afghanistan by Feb. 15 in a withdrawal that began May 15.
   Shevardnaze also called on the United States and other nations
to join the Soviets in abolishing some planned or ongoing military
programs and channel the funds toward setting up an international
system of environmental security.
   Shevardnadze also acknowledged President Reagan's speech Monday
in which the president noted U.S.-Soviet cooperation had
contributed to breakthroughs in regional security.
   ``Here I can only agree with President Reagan's remrks yesterday
about the beneficial impact of Soviet-American political dialogue
on that process,'' he said.
   On Monday, Reagan delivered a mostly conciliatory, upbeat
farewell speech before the world body he had in the past chastised
for its alleged anti-Western attitudes.
   The president condemned the use of outlawed chemical weapons in
the Persian Gulf war and called for a new global ban on such
warfare.
   He indirectly criticized Iraq's use of poison gas against its
Kurdish minority and against Iranians. Kurdish rebels have long
been fighting for a separate homeland in northern Iraq and sided
with Iran during the war.
   Reagan called on all nations to convene a conference that would
consider ways to enforce the 1925 protocol barring chemical weapons
in international conflicts. He also urged nations to cooperate in
negotiating a verifiable global ban on chemical weapons at the
Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
   Reagan praised the United Nations for negotiating a cease-fire
in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war and for opening talks to formalize
a peace treaty.
   He said U.S. and Soviet negotiators were making steady progress
on an accord to halve the superpowers' long-range, or strategic,
nuclear arsenals.
   While completion of the pact this year was ``highly doubtful,''
Reagan said, ``I can tell you a year from now is a possibility,
more than a possibility.''

<HEAD>Ben Johnson Puts A Dent In Canadian Pride</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ben Johnson, the Toronto sprinter who elated
Canadians by winning the 100-meter dash at the Olympics, again drew
an outpouring of emotion from his adopted land after he was
stripped of his gold medal for using drugs.
   ``It puts a dent in Canada,'' said Scott Shaw, a 10th grader in
Calgary, Alberta.
   Canadians watched the Jamaican-born Johnson shoot to a
9.79-second world record in the 100-meter race Saturday and win
Canada its first gold medal in Seoul.
   But today, a disappointed nation awaited the return of the burly
sprinter after a urine sample was found to contain traces of
anabolic steroids. Johnson, who was disqualified from the Olympic
Games on Monday and stripped of the gold medal, was to return to
Toronto this afternoon.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who Saturday thanked Johnson for
the ``thrill of a lifetime'' in a nationally-televised telephone
call to Seoul, said his disqualification was ``a moment of great
sorrow for all Canadians.''
   Calling the incident ``a national embarrassment,'' Sports
Minister Jean Charest said Johnson will be banned from Canada's
national team for life.
   ``A few days ago, Canada had the opportunity of having a great
day of national pride,'' Charest told reporters. He said his
government accepted the validity of the tests and the suspension
would be effective pending an appeal from Johnson.
   ``Johnson knew what the rules were,'' said Charest, who
acknowledged he had heard several months ago that Johnson might be
using steroids.
   ``From time to time people would come to me in a private way _
and this happened one or two times ... that maybe Ben Johnson is
using steroids or other drugs,'' Charest said, adding that the
sprinter was aware he would be tested at the Olympics.
   ``I don't believe he did it on purpose. He hasn't got the guile
to do that,'' said Fergus Kilmartin, 36, of Coquitlam, British
Columbia. ``I feel terribly sad for him.''
   Some Canadian athletes expressed sympathy for Johnson.
   Mike Sokowski, a teammate at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los
Angeles, said: ``Ben's a pretty simple guy. Ben does not do drugs.
He did not knowingly do this.''
   But Canadian speedskater Gaetan Boucher judged the sprinter
harshly, saying he has ``no respect'' for an athlete who takes
drugs. Boucher won two gold medals at the 1984 Winter Games in
Sarajevo, Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
   A grand jury has decided that Tawana Brawley,
whose case brought allegations of a racist coverup, fabricated her
story that she was gang raped by white men, The New York Times
reported today.
   The special state grand jury found overwhelming evidence that
the black, 16-year-old Wappinger Falls girl lied and helped create
the condition in which she was found, possibly because she feared
she would be beaten at home, the newspaper said.
   The evidence was assembled over seven months by a grand jury
that was unable to obtain testimony from Miss Brawley, who was
found Nov. 28 smeared with feces, dazed, and with racial slurs
written on her body.
   Her story attracted national attention. Prominent people who
spoke sympathetically of her plight included heavyweight boxing
champion Mike Tyson and actor Bill Cosby, who put up a $25,000
reward.
   Civil rights organizations cited the case as an example of
racism and unfairness in the criminal justice system, while Miss
Brawley refused to cooperate with investigators and the grand jury.
   An adviser to the Brawley family, the Rev. Al Sharpton,
criticized the Times report today, calling it ``nothing but a whole
succession of reckless speculations that are not backed up with one
iota of fact.''
   The Times said that more than 100 witnesses and exhibits,
including confidential medical and police reports and secretly
taped telephone conversations, were considered by the grand jury,
which was empaneled in Poughkeepsie on Feb. 29.
   The newspaper said the grand jury was expected within weeks to
issue a final report saying it has found no evidence of any
abduction, racial or sexual attack or any other crime against Miss
Brawley.
   Miss Brawley has moved with her family to Virginia Beach, Va.,
where she is attending high school. Their telephone number is
unpublished, and neither the Times nor The Associated Press could
reach the family for comment.
   Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda, defied a subpoena in June and was
sentenced to 30 days in jail, but avoided the sentence by taking
refuge in churches and finally leaving the state.
   The grand jury also subpoenaed Miss Brawley but has abandoned
hope of ever hearing her story firsthand and rescinded its vote to
subpoena her, the Poughkeepsie Journal reported today.
   Miss Brawley's other two advisers, lawyers C. Vernon Mason and
Alton Maddox, could not be reached for comment. Mason's phone went
unanswered, while a message left at Maddox' residence was not
immediately returned.
   The advisers have alleged a coverup by white officials who
refuse to prosecute whites for raping a young black.
   The Times said the grand jury specifically will clear Steven A.
Pagones, a Dutchess County assistant prosecutor, as well as other
law enforcement officials whom Brawley advisers have accused of
participating in the alleged attack.
   The grand jury concluded that contrary to the teen-ager's claim
that she was abducted Nov. 24, she had chosen not to return home
and hid for the next four days in a nearby apartment from which her
family had recently been evicted, the Times said.
   It said she, possibly with the help of an accomplice, smeared
herself with dog feces, wrote racial slurs on her body, tore and
scorched her clothes and crawled into a garbage bag and pretended
to be in a traumatized daze, the newspaper said.
   For weeks, she misled doctors, social workers, police, reporters
and concerned community people with medical complaints and false
and fragmentary accounts of her fabricated episode of horror and
then refused to cooperate to cover up her actions, the Times
reported based on the grand jury findings.
   The grand jury speculated that she may have feared her mother's
boyfriend for her late nights out and that drugs and her
relationships with shady characters may have played a role, the
Times said.
   Mrs. Brawley's boyfriend, Ralph King, had a history of violence,
the newspaper said, including serving seven years in jail for
killing his wife in 1970. The grand jury said there was evidence he
had beaten Miss Brawley, and that Mrs. Brawley had also beaten her
daughter.

<HEAD>Thompson Seeks More Control Over Chicago School Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson is asking the legislature
for changes in Chicago school reform legislation that would, among
other things, give him more power over a board that is to oversee
the reform process.
   The governor says his proposed changes in the legislation would
further the bill's goal of shifting power to the local school level.
   Thompson signed the legislation Monday in an amendatory veto, a
procedure under Illinois law in which a bill is sent back to the
legislature for consideration of the governor's written changes or
amendments.
   ``The legislation radically reforms the administrative structure
in Chicago in terms of budgeting and planning,'' Thompson said in a
statement. ``I believe that the changes suggested today will make
this bill stronger and that a majority of people throughout the
city and state agree with me.''
   Some legislative supporters of the bill said they could accept
Thompson's suggestions.
   But Chicago Teachers Union President Jacqueline Vaughn raised
objections to changes that would affect some teachers' seniority
rights, and some black lawmakers took issue with the proposed
expansion of the governor's power.
   Perhaps the most significant change sought by Thompson would
increase his authority over the seven-member Chicago School Reform
Oversight Authority, a body created to ensure that the reform
measures are put into place.
   The original bill called for four authority members to be
appointed by the mayor of Chicago and three by the governor.
Thompson's version would give the governor and the mayor three
appointments each, with the seventh member to be chosen jointly.
   Among Thompson's other proposals for change:
   _Allow the oversight authority to withhold funds if school
officials don't implement reforms properly.
   _Give principals more authority over ``remediation programs''
for teachers whose work is judged to be substandard.
   _Require local school councils to return to the Board of
Education any unspent funds at the end of a budget year, rather
than carrying the money over into the next budget year.
   _Remove a requirement that teachers with seniority whose
positions are eliminated get first preference for vacancies in
other vacant teaching posts.
   When lawmakers convene for their veto session in November, they
may accept Thompson's changes by a majority vote or override him by
a three-fifths vote and enact the bill as originally drafted. If
they fail to do either, the bill is dead.

   Prosecution witnesses testified today that
Alabama's NAACP president said it would cost about $10,000 for his
efforts in helping secure early release of a convicted killer.
   A federal court jury of 10 whites and six blacks, including
alternate jurors, began hearing testimony today in the extortion
trial of Thomas Reed, a Democratic state representative and head of
the Alabama branch of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
   Woodson Chesser of Columbus, Ga., the inmate's father, testified
that he took out two loans totaling $4,600 and combined it with
cash to pay Reed $10,000. He said he did so after meeting with Reed
about the imprisoned Anthony Chesser, who is serving a 40-year
sentence for murder in Alabama.
   ``I explained my son's situation and asked if he could help me.
He said he'd helped a lot of them and we'll see,'' Woodson Chesser
said.
   Robert Muncy, a partner in the Columbus business where Woodson
Chesser worked, testified that Reed told him he believed he would
be able to help the inmate.
   ``He mentioned that in order to get some help, it would probably
cost some money. The figure I remember is $10,000,'' said Muncy.
   Reed, the senior black member of the Alabama House, is charged
with accepting $10,000 in cash and between $5,000 and $10,000 in
restaurant equipment from the Chesser family. Reed operates two
restaurants in Macon County.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina ruled Monday he would allow into
evidence a tape of a conversation between Reed and Bobby Gene
Chesser, a Columbus, Ga., restaurant equipment salesman.
   In opening arguments Monday, defense attorney Bill Baxley
described Bobby Gene Chesser, Anthony Chesser's uncle, as a ``crook
to beat all crooks and a con man to beat all con men.''
   Bobby Gene Chesser, who was convicted in 1980 to a 10-year
sentence on a felony theft charge, testified Monday he recorded the
conversation with Reed on Aug. 28, 1986, when Reed came to his
business. FBI Special Agent Bruce Koenig of Bloomington, Va.,
testified that the 27-minute tape was authentic.
   The tape was not played in court Monday.
   Chesser wanted back the money allegedly given Reed after the
state Board of Pardons and Paroles revoked an order to move up his
nephew's consideration for parole, prosecutors have said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Broward Segrest told the jury that the
five-count indictment of Reed described the payments Chesser made
to Reed for his ``political influence'' in obtaining the early
prison release of Anthony Chesser.
   Reed's attorneys challenged allowing the tape recording into
evidence because they said it first went to a state parole board
member before it reached the FBI. Bobby Gene Chesser told the judge
he gave the tape directly to the FBI.
   The trial is expected to last three days.
   ``If the truth prevails, I'll be a free man when I leave here,''
Reed, 60, told reporters when he arrived at the U.S. District Court
in Mobile on Monday.
   The trial was moved to Mobile from Montgomery because of
publicity surrounding Reed's indictment. He also is scheduled to go
to trial Nov. 7 in Montgomery on related state bribery charges.

<TEXT>
   The 1990 Census, with a price tag some
estimate as high as $3 billion, may have problems hiring enough
workers to do the massive national head count, Census Director John
G. Keane said Tuesday.
   Keane told the House census and population subcommittee that he
generally is optimistic about plans for the 1990 count. But he
expressed concern over hiring 300,000 part-time workers, as well as
over the general attitude of the populace toward surveys and
censuses.
   On nights when he can't sleep, Keane said, ``I wonder if Census
can get enough good people to work well enough and long enough in
1990.''
   The problems will vary from area to area, and regions with a
strong economy and many two-worker families will have few people
available to take temporary or part-time jobs at pay ranging from
$5.50 an hour, he explained.
   ``One of the bureau's major management challenges ... is
acquiring and retaining a sufficient number of competent temporary
employees,'' agreed Gene L. Dodaro of the congressional General
Accounting Office, also appearing before the subcommittee of the
House Post Office and Civil Service Committee.
   In 1980 there were times when the bureau could fill only 70
percent of its openings in many areas, Dodaro said, particularly in
large cities such as New York, Dallas, Philadelphia and Denver.
   Thus far, Dodaro noted, the Census Bureau has been on schedule
and under budget in its planning and dress rehearsals for the 1990
count, despite occasional technical problems.
   Dodaro warned, though, that with inflation the overall cost of
the 1990 count could top $3 billion.
   The Census Bureau has estimated the census will cost about $2.6
billion, well over twice the $1.1 billion it cost to count the
nation in 1980.
   But Dodaro said he expects the final costs to outrun the
planning estimates.
   In addition to hiring, Keane expressed concern about Americans'
attitude toward being counted.
   ``The climate has deteriorated in this nation for taking
censuses and surveys. How much it has deteriorated, we don't
know,'' Keane said. He cited as problems ``junk mail, junk phone
calls and sometimes questionable door-to-door businesses.''
   For most of the nation, the Census will come in the mail,
although Census takers will visit many homes in rural areas where
good mailing lists are not available.
   Congress is considering legislation requiring the bureau to
adjust its final figures to compensate for people who may be missed
in the national head count.
   The bureau has resisted this in the past, contending that it
could not produce accurate estimates of people who are missed and
warning that changing the count would damage public confidence in
the numbers.
   Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., asked how the bureau would
respond if the bill passes.
   ``If ordered to do something we would do the best we could under
the circumstances. It might not be as good as some would like,''
said Peter Bounpane, who is directing planning for the 1990 count.
   Asked about a bill to require the bureau to count military
personnel overseas for purposes of congressional reapportionment,
Bounpane said that poses some problems.
   Counting those people and asking their home state can be done,
he explained, but it isn't always easy to assign military people to
a hometown within a state. Thus, a state population total could add
up to more than the sum of all the local populations in the state,
and that can cause difficulty in drawing congressional district
lines within a state, Bounpane said.
   Counting illegal aliens in the Census has also become a
political question, but Keane explained that the bureau must count
them. The Constitution and the 1790 Census law require the agency
to count everyone residing in the United States, he explained, not
just citizens.

   Hundreds of students and fishermen
marched through the streets of this Adriatic port city on Tuesday
to protest the planned docking of a freighter bringing back
chemical wastes from Nigeria.
   The Deep Sea Carrier is one of three ships carrying Italian
industrial wastes that the government of Nigeria ordered returned
to Italy but that no Italian port wants to accept.
   Mayor Matteo Quitadamo of Manfredonia said local authorities
will try to block the docking of the Deep Sea Carrier unless the
national government announces a plan for the final disposal of the
waste elsewhere.
   Protests have also taken place in Leghorn and Ravenna, hampering
the government's efforts to bring the chemical wastes ashore
pending disposal.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Florida Girl Isn't Pennsylvania Couple's Long-Lost Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who claim their newborn was swapped
for a baby with a heart defect are looking in the wrong place with
a lawsuit claiming a Florida girl is theirs, a lawyer said.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg claim in a $100 million federal lawsuit
filed here that their healthy newborn was swapped at Hardee
Memorial Hospital.
   Florida birth records show only one other white girl was born at
the hospital about the time Mrs. Twigg gave birth in 1978. Based on
public records, the Twiggs believe the Florida girl, who has not
been publicly identified, could be their child.
   The girl the Twiggs, now of Langhorne, Pa., took from the
hospital was named Arlena, and she died Aug. 23 of complications
after heart surgery at the Deborah Heart and Lung Center in Browns
Mills, N.J. The suit says that while Arlena was being prepared for
a blood transfusion last May, a doctor at Johns Hopkins in
Baltimore determined that neither of the Twiggs could be her parent.
   But Dale Swope, a lawyer for the Florida child's father, said he
believes the Twiggs are wrong.
   The girl's father ``sees her mother's look in her face,'' Swope
said. The girl's mother died of cancer in 1981.
   Swope said Monday he will probably advise his client to provide
a sample of the girl's blood for genetic testing as a ``courtesy''
to the Twiggs.
   The blood test, a procedure called HLA testing that compares
proteins on white blood cells, is frequently used in paternity
disputes and can prove that adults are not the biological parents
of a child. It also can offer an extremely high probability that
adults are the biological parents of a child.
   Marvin Ellin, who represents the Twiggs, has said that if the
Florida girl's father refuses requests for testing, he will seek a
court order. The Twiggs say they aren't sure if they'll seek
custody if the girl proves to be their daughter.

<TEXT>
   The capital's 17,000 taxi drivers began a
three-day strike Tuesday to protest anti-pollution measures that
restrict cab circulation in the city center.
   Taxis are included in traffic restrictions banning half the
city's 800,000 cars from a five-square-mile zone around the center
between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekdays, according to odd and even
license plate numbers.
   It was the first strike by taxi drivers since the resrictions
were reimposed Sept. 1 after a two-month summer break.
   ``The anti-pollution measures create tremendous problems for us
as we make half our money in the city center. This walkout is just
the beginning of more strike action,'' said Kostas Lainis,
president of the taxi drivers' union.
   Taxis were first banned from the center in January when
anti-pollution measures were stepped up in an effort to reduce a
brown smog cloud that hangs over Athens on warm, still days. Cars,
diesel-powered taxis and the city's ageing buses are blamed for
spewing most pollutants into the atmosphere.

   The High Court has overturned the
conviction of a man who was sentenced to three months in jail for
refusing to pick up a government official whose car had broken
down, newspapers reported Tuesday.
   The court said Monday that the magistrate who tried Peter Kitavi
Makau had no jurisdiction to deal with the case, the newspapers
said.
   Makau, 36, an air-conditioning technician, was driving a company
car on June 8 when he was flagged down by provincial Commissioner
Mohamed Yusuf Haji. Haji's government car had broken down and he
asked Makau for a ride.
   When he refused, Haji reported the incident to police who
arrested Makau.
   The defendant was convicted of undermining the authority of a
public officer and sentenced to prison. He was released on bond
after appealing to High Court, which overturned his conviction and
sentence Monday.

<HEAD>U.S. Team Leaves For Crash Site In Laos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team flew to Laos on
Tuesday to search plane crash sites from the Indochina war for
clues about missing American soldiers, an official said.
   In Vietnam, another U.S. team was working with local officials
on the second day of an unprecedented investigation to determine
the fates of seven American airmen lost in plane crashes near the
capital of Hanoi.
   Maj. Thomas J. Boyd, spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command,
said the team that left Bangkok for eastern Laos will examine an
area around Sepone to prepare for possible later excavations of the
crash sites.
   The team is from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and
Army Central Identification Laboratory, Honolulu-based units
seeking to account for 2,393 Americans missing in action from the
war in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia that ended in 1975 with communist
victories in all three countries.
   ``They will look at crash sites and determine what kind of
aircraft, how it crashed, and determine the potential for possible
future site excavations,'' Boyd told reporters. He said a Marine
with special expertise in plane crashes was on the team.
   Losses in that area near the Vietnamese border include airmen
downed in missions to cut off the Ho Chi Minh Trail, used by
communist North Vietnam to infiltrate troops to U.S.-backed South
Vietnam.
   The United States and Laos have conducted three previous joint
crash site excavations, most recently in May.
   The American team in Vietnam, which brought its own
interpreters, are interviewing villagers who witnessed the
incidents in which the men were lost and are seeking evidence such
as local government reports and human remains.
   Boyd said the seven are among 70 cases in which the United
States says there is strong evidence the men survived and were
taken under Vietnamese control. The United States says it cannot
prove any Americans are alive in Indochina but cannot ignore that
possibility.
   The Defense Intelligence Agency is investigating 119 reports of
purported sightings of Americans, Boyd said.
   The Americans drove to the Vietnamese villages Monday in jeeps
flown in from Honolulu the day before. The search is planned for
about 10 days.
   Boyd said the two sides may later excavate plane crash sites
found during the investigation.
   Previously, the only significant joint field activity was in
late 1985, when U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese state workers dug up
the wreckage of a U.S. B-52 bomber just outside Hanoi. They found
remains but none identified as missing Americans.
   Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, leader of the U.S. team in Vietnam, earlier
expressed hope of several joint investigation operations in the
coming months. ``We are prepared to provide four teams, if Vietnam
agrees,'' he said.
   Of the missing, 1,757 are in Vietnam, 547 in Laos, 83 in
Cambodia and six in China. U.S. forces withdrew from Indochina in
1973, after the conflict cost 58,000 American lives.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Legal Cooperation Agreements With Six
Nations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treaties with six countries calling for
cooperation in narcotics prosecutions and other criminal matters
were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday
after Sen. Jesse Helms tried and failed to shelve agreements with
Mexico and the Bahamas.
   The committee voted 17-2 to recommend the full Senate approve
the legal cooperation treaties with those two nations.
   Helms, R-N.C., protested that they should not be ratified until
the president can certify that no Mexican or Bahamian officials are
involved with narcotics trafficking.
   Cooperation treaties with Canada, Belgium, Thailand and the
Cayman Islands were approved on a voice vote and sent to the Senate
floor for action.
   Helms contended that the governments of the Bahamas and Mexico
include senior officials who have assisted the drug trade. He said
ratification of the treaties would send a signal that the United
States is not serious in waging war against narcotics.
   ``You don't fight drugs by being partners with the drug
traffickers,'' he said.
   But Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the treaties, negotiated by
the Justice Department, will provide both a potentially important
law enforcement tool and a gauge by which to judge whether the
Bahamas and Mexico are living up to their commitments.
   ``If we have this treaty in place we will have a Justice
Department to Justice Department relationship that will be almost
strictly law enforcement oriented,'' Kerry said. ``There will be an
opportunity for creative requests that will let us see if there is
cooperation.''
   The Mutual Legal Assistance treaties are designed to provide a
framework by which the United States can request the cooperation of
the countries involved to obtain evidence to use in criminal
prosecutions in the United States.
   Each of the six countries could make similar requests of the
United States.

<HEAD>EPA Restricts Use Of Tin-Based Marine Paints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency has
ordered drastic curtailments of highly toxic tin-based marine
paints, banning unsupervised use by pleasure boat owners, the
agency said Tuesday.
   The regulations carry out a new law requiring a five-fold
reduction in the release rate of the active ingredient in the
paints, tributyl tin or TBT compounds, from most hulls.
   The law bans use of the paints on non-aluminum hulls of vessels
of less than 25 meters or 82 feet in deck length, and requires a
long-term daily average release rate of 4 micrograms per square
centimeter (about 0.1 thousandths of an ounce per square foot) or
less on other hulls. Existing paints can release TBT at about 20
micrograms per square centimeter.
   The paints may be sold from inventories until Dec. 16 and be
used until next June 16.
   Sold since the 1960s, the nine TBT compounds make the paint last
much longer than other compounds needed to prevent the growth of
barnacles and other organisms on hulls.
   But their extreme toxicity has led to oyster shell deformities
in France, England and Oregon, and EPA estimates that mussels and
clams may be killed at concentrations as low as 20 parts per
trillion _ a concentration reported for at least 30 U.S. sites,
primarily areas with heavy boating activity.
   As it proposed to do before Congress stepped in, EPA said it is
restricting sale of the paints to applicators certified under state
pesticide programs. Use will be limited to those applicators or
people working under the direct personal supervision of certified
applicators.
   Formulators must revise labels to incorporate provisions of the
new regulations and instructions for proper disposal.
   The law gives EPA authority to modify the release rate after it
completes its studies, and the agency warned that its action in
adopting the congressionally mandated rate in its regulations was
not final and could be changed.
   EPA said it may have enough data next year to determine
acceptable limits to human health of TBT ingested in drinking water
and fish tissues.
   Data on additional ecological effects, worker exposure and
environmental fate of the compounds are due from manufacturers over
the next four years.
   About 1 million pounds of TBT compounds have been used in some
624,000 gallons of paint sold each year, of which about 4 percent
has gone to paint docks, buoys and other gear.
   Copper-based paints, which require painting every year or two
instead of the seven-year interval possible with TBT, are the chief
alternative.

   Former Teamsters President Roy Williams
was released from prison early today after serving less than 34
months of a 10-year sentence given him for conspiring to bribe a
U.S. senator.
   Government officials said they would expect Williams to continue
his involvement with the government's war on organized crime as a
condition of his release.
   Officials at the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners said
Williams, 73, was released at 1 a.m., through prisoners ordinarily
are released later in the day. ``He didn't want to be exposed to
press coverage and cameras,'' said his lawyer, Bruce Houdek.
   Williams, 73, suffers from acute emphysema and an enlarged
heart. Houdek said he is ``disabled from any work'' and needs an
artificial supply of oxygen 24 hours a day.
   The U.S. Parole Commission announced Friday that Williams, who
has been treated for emphysema and an enlarged heart while serving
his term at the Springfield medical center, would be paroled in
recognition of testimony against organized crime figures that ``was
at great risk to his personal safety.''
   Houdek said Williams traveled from Springfield to his farm home
in Leeton in west-central Missouri.
   ``He's basically trying to be at home and relax and wake up
without bars on the windows and people telling him what to do,''
Houdek said. ``Basically, he's trying to acclimate himself to
normal life.''
   ``This release is contigent upon his continued cooperation with
law enforcement authorities,'' parole commission chairman Benjamin
Baer said in a statement Friday. Baer added that Williams could be
returned to prison if he did not cooperate.
   Russell Millin, a Kansas City attorney who represents Williams,
has said his client ``will tell the truth if he's asked, as he has
done in the past.''
   Williams was convicted in 1982 of conspiring to bribe a U.S.
senator for his help in defeating legislation to deregulate
trucking.
   In an 1985 effort to get his prison sentence reduced, Williams
testified for federal prosecutors that reputed Kansas City crime
boss Nick Civella paid him $1,500 a month from late 1974 to
mid-1981. Williams said he had agreed to help Civella's
organization secure a multimillion-dollar loan from the Teamsters
Central States Pension Fund.
   The parole commission's announcement Friday came the day a
federal judge had threatened to release Williams if his parole was
not re-evaluated.
   U.S. District Judge William Collinson had ruled that the parole
commission was unconstitutionally trying to block Williams' release
because of the statements he made about his own links to organized
crime, statements that were made after Williams was granted
immunity from prosecution.
   Williams began serving the sentence Dec. 3, 1985.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Appropriation Bill Despite Objections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan today signed a $10.5 billion
appropriation bill for the Interior Department and related
agencies, but warned that it represents ``congressional
overspending'' and runs the risk of across-the-board budget cuts
under the deficit-reduction act.
   The measure appropriates $680 million more than the president
requested. He said it bings the nation $198 million closer to
triggering cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The measure was the fifth appropriation bill that Reagan has
received and signed of the 13 bills Congress annually considers.
   ``I urge the Congress to act swiftly to send me the remainder of
the fiscal year 1989 appropriations bills _ on time and on
budget,'' Reagan said.
   Although he said that ``on balance the act merited my
approval,'' the president complained that it once again extended
the moratorium on granting oil and gas leases for certain areas of
the outer continental shelf.
   ``The Congress increased the damaging effect of the moratorium
by extending it to apply to grants of permits for drilling and
exploration activities under leases already granted,'' he said.
``For the Congress to prohibit the issuance of such permits to
those who already had obtained leases is unfair.''
   Reagan also said that portions of the bill, requiring approval
of congressional committees for such things as changes in Forest
Service regional boundaries, are unconstitutional.

   A national survey found ``major gains in
stature'' for Democrat Michael Dukakis in the presidential debate,
although that poll and three others rated the confrontation a tie
overall.
   None of the surveys found much change in voter preferences as a
result of Sunday's debate between Dukakis and Republican George
Bush, and most found relatively narrow movement in underlying
opinions of the candidates.
   But Dukakis did better than expected at standing up under
pressure and at appearing ``more presidential,'' a Los Angeles
Times poll found, and Bush lost ground in his rating on being able
to handle the federal deficit.
   Bush, however, improved his ratings in the poll on holding down
taxes, controlling crime and maintaining the national defense, and
more viewers rated him as likable than had expected to before the
debate.
   The outcome was rated even overall: Thirty-five percent of the
637 voters polled by the newspaper said Dukakis won the debate, 34
percent picked Bush and 29 percent called it a tie.
   Similarly, in a Gallup poll for Newsweek 42 percent said Dukakis
did the better job and 41 percent said Bush did better; in a ABC
News poll 44 percent said Dukakis won, 36 percent Bush; and in a
CBS News poll 42 percent said Bush won, 39 percent Dukakis.
   All the splits were within sampling error. The polls were
conducted Sunday night by calling back voters who had been
interviewed before the debate and said they intended to watch it.
   ``It's a wash,'' said Larry Hugick, political pollster for the
Gallup Organization. ``What we found is that the debate simply
reinforced the image that voters had of these men prior to the
debate.''
   As in pre-debate polls, Bush was rated higher on national
defense _ 63-31 in the Gallup poll of 337 voters _ while Dukakis
scored better on compassion, 51-33. The two were rated even on
being able to create needed changes and on having the ideas to
foster good economic conditions.
   Said Hugick: ``These guys are just even on a lot of things that
seem to be critical to who's going to win.''
   ABC's poll, of 639 debate watchers, indicated a possible
``sliver of movement'' toward Dukakis, said poll analyst John
Brennan. When polled before the debate, the 639 favored Dukakis in
the election by 48-46; when called back after the debate, they
favored Dukakis by 52-45.
   But the CBS poll of 415 debate viewers found the possibility of
incremental movement the other way. That group favored Bush by
49-44 before the debate and by 52-43 after it.
   In any case, ``Over 90 percent of each man's supporters stayed
with him through the debate,'' said Brennan. ``And that is the way
these things go. Even if it's a knockout, the effect on the horse
race is usually marginal.''
   On the movement in Dukakis' stature, the Los Angeles Times poll
found that before the debate respondents were split on who would
stand up better under pressure, with 36 percent picking Bush to 35
percent for Dukakis. After the debate, 48 percent said Dukakis has
stood up better, to 24 percent for Bush.
   And voters by 49 percent to 22 percent had expected Bush to be
``more presidential.'' After the debate, the division was narrower:
Forty-five percent said Bush had been more presidential, 29 percent
said Dukakis.
   The Los Angeles Times' analysis called those results ``major
gains in stature'' for Dukakis.
   Also, before the debate the newspaper poll found that 36 percent
thought Bush could do better at handling the deficit; after the
debate, that fell to 23 percent. Overall, though, the race was a
tie: Forty-six percent favored Bush for president, 46 percent
Dukakis.
   The horse race results applied just to debate watchers and not
to the entire electorate. Also, the polls had relatively small
sample sizes, and one-night surveys can be difficult to analyze
because they measure visceral reaction to a single event. The
margin of sampling error was five points in the Los Angeles Times,
CBS and ABC polls, six in Gallup's.

   Emperor Hirohito thanked the Japanese people on
Tuesday for their outpouring of concern over his fragile health,
but doctors expressed no optimism about his condition.
   Palace officials said physicians have failed to contain Emperor
Hirohito's internal bleeding, and the government said it has
summoned the ailing 87-year-old monarch's grandson home from
Britain.
   Kenji Maeda, head of general affairs for the Imperial Palace,
quoted chief palace physician Akira Takagi as saying: ``The
emperor's condition is stable but it's not improving either. It's
an extremely difficult situation.''
   Maeda said doctors found ``slight traces'' of blood in the
emperor's bowel discharge Monday night, an indication of internal
hemorrhaging.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi told reporters that Prince
Aya, the 22-year-old younger son of Crown Prince Akihito, would
return to Japan shortly from his studies at Oxford University.
   Japanese officials have refused to confirm or deny media reports
that the world's longest-reigning monarch is dying of cancer.
   Cabinet members have remained within calling distance and
scheduled visits by the prime ministers of Italy and Ireland have
been put on hold.
   More than 30,000 well-wishers called on the Imperial Palace in a
chilling rain Tuesday to sign registries wishing for the emperor's
recovery, the palace reported. Nearly 600,,000 people had signed
their names to registries at the palace and at 11 locations around
the country.
   Elderly Japanese, some wiping away tears, knelt in front of the
285-acre imperial residence in central Tokyo to pray for the
monarch, who was considered a deity until the end of World War II.
   Informed of the public response to his illness, the emperor
commented today: ``I thank everyone for their concern. Please
express my gratitude,'' according to a palace official.
   ``All we can say is that the emperor has come through one week
in stable condition,'' the agency quoted Akira Takagi, Hirohito's
chief physician, as saying.
   Hirohito received another blood transfusion Tuesday.
   His slight fever of 98.2 was down from 99 Monday evening but
still above his normal level of about 95.9.
   Although the emperor's body temperature and other vital readings
appeared to have stabilized, doctors said they were using
antibiotics to control fever and inflammation. News reports said
the emperor was also suffering from jaundice and anemia.
   Hirohito has had no food in eight days and aside from two small
ice cubes, has been unable to swallow water and is being fed
intravenously.

   The scientific adviser to the archbishop of Turin
said today he was told laboratory tests show the Shroud of Turin
was made in the 14th century and could not be the burial cloth of
Christ.
   Professor Luigi Gonella said he has not yet seen the official
report from the three laboratories that conducted the carbon-14
dating tests, but that all the leaks to the press dated it to the
14th century and ``somebody let me understand that the rumors were
right.''
   ``All the leaks were too exact, too concentrated to be a pure
invention,'' he said in a telephone interview from the archdiocese
in Turin.
   The shroud, 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide,
bears the faint, blood-stained image of a whipped and crucified
man. Some have maintained the linen is the burial cloth of Christ,
while others have dismissed it as a clever forgery.
   Gonella refused to identify who had told him about the shroud
but expressed anger the person did not apologize for the leaks to
the press.
   ``It is quite evident somebody sold out to the press,'' said
Gonella.
   Gonella said it was not the church that demanded secrecy and
denied they were holding back the results.
   ``They (the labs) asked for the blind test. They said they would
make no effort to determine which sample came from the shroud. The
raw data was to be sent back to the British Museum where the key to
the code would identify the samples from the shroud. Then they
would write up the scientific result,'' he said.
   ``It is now clear somebody, I don't know who or how many, made a
deliberate effort to determine which sample was the shroud and
released it to the press,'' said Gonella.
   Gonella said the British Museum, as coordinator of the study,
had access to the results. It reportedly sent the official results
Friday to Turin by special courier.
   Gonella said the official results will be released ``quickly''
after the owner, Pope John Paul II, is informed. However, he said
he could not say exactly when the tests would be made public.
   The laboratories chosen to conduct the carbon-14 tests were
Oxford, The University of Arizona and the Swiss Federal Institute
of Technology at the University of Zurich.
   The Roman Catholic Church does not claim the shroud as a holy
relic, but instead considered the shroud a ``cherished object'' and
treated it with the respect due a holy relic because of the
possibility it could be the burial cloth of Christ, Gonella said.
   Gonella also bristled at suggestions in the press that if the
shroud was dated to the 14th century it had to be a forgery or a
fake.
   ``It could be a genuine work of Christian art,'' Gonella said.
``Just because it is not the burial cloth of Christ does not
necessarily mean it is a forgery or a fake, which implies an intent
to mislead,'' he said.
   Gonella said tests results dating the shroud to the 14th century
would not entirely resolve the centuries-old riddle about the
shroud.
   One of the lasting mysteries is how the shroud was made.
   Gonella pointed to the other scientific studies, such as the
1978 Shroud of Turin Project, which could not determine exactly how
the image on the shroud was created. During that study, dozens of
American scientists subjected the cloth to chemical and computer
analysis and took 30,000 photographs of it.
   The short recorded history of the shroud has always fueled the
debate on its authenticity. French crusader Robert of Clari
mentioned seeing the shroud in 1203 in Constantinople at the
imperial palace, but the first actual records trace it only to
Lirey in France in 1354.
   The shroud was bequeathed to the pope by ex-king Umberto II of
Italy, a member of the House of Savoy, upon his death in 1983.

   Sen. Dan Quayle promised college
students today that a new Republican administration will give them
``a drug-free and AIDS-free America.''
   The GOP vice presidential nominee, heading for important
campaign appearances in Texas, appealed to 2,000 McNeese State
University students as ``children of the 80s'' for support in the
Nov. 8 elections.
   ``Let me tell you something, children of the 80s, the values of
family, future and freedom will never change,'' said the Indiana
senator, 41, the first baby boomer on a national party ticket.
   He promised if the GOP ticket headed by Vice President George
Bush is elected, ``we will do all that we must ... to give you a
drug-free and AIDS-free America.''
   He also promised every effort to provide better health care for
Americans as each generation takes care of elderly citizens who are
living longer than ever.
   ``George Bush and I are the leaders of tomorrow,'' Quayle said.
``We will lead this country forward into the decade of the 1990s.
We will make the future better than the past.''
   Quayle stood at Bush's side Monday at a Jackson, Tenn., rally in
his first joint appearance with the vice president since the
Republican National Convention in mid-August. He beamed as Bush
said he had ``not only confidence but pride'' in his embattled
running mate.
   From Lake Charles, Quayle headed for to Houston and El Paso on
his first campaign foray into Lone Star State, whose senator, Lloyd
Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, will meet
Quayle in a nationally televised debate early next month.
   Texas, with its 29 electoral votes, is a key battleground in the
general election.
   Bush's judgment in picking Quayle was questioned by Democrat
Michael Dukakis in Sunday's debate, but Bush made a point during
Monday's rally of publicly praising his youthful running mate.
   The vice president predicted that the public would ``see some
more action'' when it tuned in to watch Quayle's Oct. 5 debate with
Bentsen, the Texas senator running with Dukakis.
   ``He's going to do just fine,'' Bush said, at one point giving
Quayle's arm a fatherly pat.
   Quayle was lavish in his praise for Bush's debate performance as
he addressed the rally of several thousand people at Casey Jones
Village, a railroad theme park.
   And, he had an answer for Dukakis' comments that ``the notion of
President Quayle is a very, very troubling notion tonight.''
   For most people, Quayle said, ``the notion of President Dukakis
is a very, very troubling notion today.''
   Despite the scripted rallies, the day was not without its drama.
   Quayle's plane, a 727 American Trans Air jet, had to abort its
landing just before it was to touch down in Jackson because the
pilot said another aircraft was in the process of landing on a
perpendicular runway in front of Quayle's plane. The airfield has
no air traffic control operation.
   The Quayle jet landed uneventfully on its second try, just
before Air Force Two arrived carrying Bush.
   In New Orleans later, Quayle toured the Martin Marietta NASA
Michoud assembly facility, which makes the external fuel tank for
the space shuttle, and then spoke to a convention of the National
Alliance of Business.
   At the Martin Marietta plant, Quayle noted that the countdown
had begun for this week's launch of the space shuttle Discovery. He
said the shuttle ``must and will remain vital ... and as confidence
in the space program is once again restored, through your hard
work, the U.S. will move on to other steps such as the space
station.''
   After his Texas swing, Quayle returns to Washington on Thursday
to begin preparing for the debate with Bentsen in Omaha, Neb.
   Quayle, 41, has said he views the event as an opportunity to
give the American public a ``direct and unedited'' look at his
qualifications and put to rest doubts they may have because of
media coverage of his candidacy and controversies over his military
service, academic record and personal life.
   Quayle has already begun receiving briefings on various issues
for the debate, aides said. Over the weekend, he received briefings
on economic issues from Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking member
of the Senate Budget Committee, and on labor issues from Labor
Secretary Ann McLaughlin. Quayle also had a foreign policy session
recently with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., will stand in for Bentsen during
Quayle's debate preparation.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They've never seen Michael Jackson but
do a fair imitation of moon-walking. For Indian fans of Western
rock music, the Beatles are a cult, Elvis is still alive, and
Madonna is scintillating.
   Almost no major Western rockers have toured India, but that
hasn't prevented thousands of Indians from being hooked on their
music.
   The long wait for a top Western pop concert ends Friday when a
rock-star-studded entourage including Bruce Springsteen, Sting and
Tracy Chapman hits New Delhi as part of a worldwide Amnesty
International tour.
   ``This is the biggest show to reach Southeast Asia,'' said Anil
Gupta, an organizer of the concert. ``It's the first time music's
mega-stars are playing in the region.''
   It will be staged in Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, with 70,000
tickets on sale.
   ``I visualize it as more than a sellout,'' said Gupta. ``I have
gotten inquiries for tickets from as far away as Trivandrum.''
   Trivandrum, on the southern tip of India, is 1,115 miles from
New Delhi.
   It is the first large Western music concert in India since the
groups Boney M and Osibisa performed in the early 1980s.
   But cassettes of Western artists sell by the hundreds every day
in the shops of major Indian cities.
   Letters pour into the Western music section of the
government-owned radio station, which runs at least three weekly
request programs from New Delhi and other big cities.
   ``I hear music from every house when I return home at night,''
says Rocque Fernandes, a drummer and the leader of a band which
plays in New Delhi hotels and restaurants.
   ``It's mostly beat music played on loud stereos. But there's
almost no Hindi music to be heard _ maybe because Hindi music
nowadays is Western music for 11 bars at a time.''
   Under international copyright laws, any duplication of at least
12 bars of existing music is an infringement.
   Hindi music is the term used to describe songs in films in the
Hindi language. In earlier years, the films were mostly lyrical
romances, and their soulful songs helped make a movie popular.
   But more recent films are more action-oriented, pulsing with a
disco Hindi-language soundtrack whose rhythms are usually taken
from Western hit tunes.
   Fernandes, from the Indian state of Goa, a former Portuguese
colony, leads a band which provides a rare opportunity to hear
Western music live in India.
   In live Indian performances, the music imitates the original,
but the vocals often have the unmistakable accent of an Indian
speaking or singing in English.
   Fernandes concedes his trio, which usually consists of a lead
guitarist doubling as the vocalist, a bass guitarist and himself on
the drums, cannot provide the best quality of music. ``Our
equipment isn't that good,'' he said.
   ``It's also difficult for most people to afford the prices our
hotels and clubs charge,'' he said. ``Ultimately, most fans have to
be satisfied with their stereos. Live music is expensive and even
then it's not too good.''
   The cassettes sell for about $2.15, and pirated versions go for
about two-thirds the price. Records are difficult to come by, and
compact discs have not yet made an impact in the country.
   The recent top sellers, according to New Delhi shop owner Ashok
Chehal, are Madonna, Samantha Fox and Michael Jackson.

   Rescue workers searched Tuesday for a college
student who was swept over the 65-foot Cumberland Falls as other
students watched in horror, authorities said.
   Teresa Dalton, 18, of Princewick, W.Va., slipped and fell over
the weekend while she was wading in shallow water just above the
falls, said Kentucky Water Patrol Officer Conley Allen. The
powerful current pulled Ms. Dalton over the waterfall.
   David Bryant, a Cumberland College junior from Miramar, Fla.,
was wading with Ms. Dalton and holding her hand when the accident
occurred. He also fell but grabbed a rock and kept from going over
the falls, he told police.
   On Monday, rescue workers unsuccessfully dragged the area. The
search, which has been hampered by rising water and fog, resumed
Tuesday.
   As Ms. Dalton went over the falls, students who had accompanied
her on the outing watched.
   ``I was yelling her name and hoping she would find something to
grab onto, but she kept going,'' Natalie Strange, a freshman from
Prattville, Ala., said in a statement to the Water Patrol.
   Danny E. Brown, superintendent of Cumberland Falls State Park,
said that until this summer it had been five years since anyone
went over the falls and died.
   On Aug. 27, a Tennessee man drowned after he jumped off the
overlook at the falls. The last death before that occurred Dec. 30,
1985, when a 13-year-old boy fell from a cliff while he was hiking
downriver from the falls.

   Attorneys for syndicated columnist Carl T.
Rowan today argued that errors on a police form make it impossible
to prove Rowan used an unregistered handgun to wound a teenager
intruder.
   Sgt. Rise Williams, who works in the District of Columbia police
department's gun control unit, testified that the form _ filled out
several days after the June 14 incident to show that Rowan had not
registered the weapon used in the shooting _ did not specify
whether the paper referred to the columnist or his son, Carl Jr.
   Under questioning from Raoul Carroll, Rowan's attorney, Williams
also testified that Rowan's birthdate is listed on the form as
Sept. 11, 1925. Rowan's actual birthdate is Aug. 11, 1925.
   Williams said the columnist's address is listed correctly on the
form, but also testified that Rowan's son, a former FBI agent, had
used his father's address when he registered other weapons.
   A photograph of the person named on the form is another method
by which police can identify the individual named on the document,
but prosecutor Thomas C. Collier did not ask Williams to say
whether the columnist's or his son's photograph is attached to the
document. Williams refused to tell reporters after her testimony
which Rowan's picture was attached to the form.
   Arguing that the registration form, the police department's
formal method for telling prosecutors an unregistered weapon has
been used in a crime, fails to link Rowan to an unregistered
weapon, Carroll asked D.C. Superior Court Judge Arthur L. Burnett
Sr., for an immediate judgement of innocence. Burnett denied that
motion.
   Rowan, an outspoken opponent of handgun use and possession, on
June 14 shot a teenager who took a dip in the columnist's pool
without permission. If convicted on the charges of unlawful
possession of a gun and ammunition, Rowan would face a maximum
penalty of two years in jail and a $2,000 fine.
   Burnett on Monday selected a panel of 14 jurors, including two
alternates, from a pool of 60 prospective jurors.
   The jurors are eight men and six women. Eleven are black, three
are white. Rowan, 63, is black.
   During the proceedings, Rowan sat impassively at the defense
table, occasionally glancing at family members seated in the
courtroom.
   Burnett said the trial could last as long as a week, but Carroll
estimated that the matter could be sent to a jury by Wednesday.
   Rowan has steadfastly maintained that his son was repeatedly
rebuffed by city officials in his efforts to register the weapon
used in the shooting.
   Carroll had argued that the charges against the columnist should
be dismissed on these grounds, but Burnett rejected that motion,
ruling that the case centered on whether Rowan was authorized to
use the weapon, not whether it had been properly registered.
   However, Burnett ruled Monday that Rowan can enter as evidence
his son's account of efforts to register the .22-caliber weapon,
and detailed information about death threats the columnist says
prompted him to accept the weapon from his son in early 1983.

   The man appointed president of Panama
today described the U.S. drug charges against Gen. Manuel Noriega
as lies and charged Washington with trying to overthrow the
Panamanian government.
   President Manuel Solis Palma in an address to the U.N. General
Assembly portrayed Panama as waging a battle against narcotics
traffickers. Palma said Noriega and his country were victims of a
U.S. propaganda war that could grow into armed conflict.
   Outside the assembly hall, Vernon A. Walters, the chief U.S.
representative to the United Nations, described the allegations as
``a litany of false accusations against the United States by Gen.
Noriega's hand-picked chief of state.''
   Noriega, considered the de-facto ruler of Panama, named Solis
Palma president in February, after deposing Solis Palmas'
predecessor, Eric Arturo Devalle. The United States continues to
recognize Devalle as president.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida this year on drug trafficking
charges after a lengthy U.S. investigation. Noriega denies
wrongdoing and has resisted U.S. efforts to remove him from power.
   ``I say that the whole campaign ... is nothing other than a
sinister tissue of lies and falsehoods carried out by the United
States government,'' Solis Palma said.
   The purpose of the attack is ``to overthrow the legitimate
government of Panama and impose a de-facto regime headed by figures
committed to renegotiation'' of the latest Panama Canal treaty,
Palma said.
   Under provisions of that treaty, the United States agreed to
relinquish operational control over the canal on Dec. 31, 1999.

   Princess Diana blushed brightly
Tuesday when workers whistled at her while she toured a car factory
in northwest England.
   The princess laughed off the whistling when she met with a small
contingent of women machinists among the Ford factory's 9,700
workers.
   ``I have never stopped blushing all morning because of those men
downstairs,'' she told them. ``They have really given me a bad
time.''
   Also Tuesday, Buckingham Palace announced that Diana and her
husband, Prince Charles, have been invited to visit China and Hong
Kong next year.
   Dates for the trip and other details are still being discussed
with Chinese officials, a palace spokesman said. Neither Charles,
heir to the British throne, nor Diana, have visited China before,
said the spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British

   As four giant TV screens recreated the special
effects of his ``Thriller'' and ``Bad'' videos, Michael Jackson
dazzled a crowd of nearly 17,000 with a high-energy show that was
part Little Richard and part Las Vegas.
   Monday's sell-out audience at Civic Arena included pre-teens in
T-shirts, businessmen in suits and college students in leather who
sang, threw flowers at a laser-lighted stage and danced in the
aisles.
   A video curtain of 4,000 high-intensity lights displayed a
Jackson caricature before rising to reveal a custom-built,
62-by-83-foot stage as Jackson strutted to the song ``Want to Be
Startin' Something.''
   Dressed in black and silver, the 30-year-old singer danced with
a fan during ``She's Out of My Life,'' donned a football jacket for
``Thriller,'' and drew the biggest cheers of the night with his
trademark moonwalk during ``Billie Jean.''
   Tuesday and Wednesday nights' shows also were sold out.
Twenty-four more U.S. concerts are booked in seven cities before
the tour concludes in Japan.

   Paid union scale of $97 each, 12 young residents
of a New York City welfare hotel became actors for a day thanks to
Ilene Kristen of ``Ryan's Hope.''
   The actress invited the children to perform in an episode of the
daytime serial in July when she volunteered to teach acting,
singing and fitness at the hotel.
   The 12 performed Monday in a segment in which welfare hotel
residents chase a drug dealer from their neighborhood.
   Antoine Robinson, 12, who lives with his family in an apartment
now, made such an impression on Kristen that he was given a
speaking role with several lines.
   When Kristen asked him if he wanted to rehearse, he replied,
``No, I'm confident, babe.''

   A retired FBI agent who helped capture
kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst said a new film based on
her autobiography inaccurately portrays many events of the saga.
   ``Patty Hearst,'' directed by Paul Schrader, details how Ms.
Hearst was abducted in 1974 by the Symbionese Liberation Army, was
kept blindfolded in a closet for 57 days and participated in a bank
robbery and other crimes. Ms. Hearst, who claimed she had been
brainwashed, spent three years in custody before her sentence was
commuted. She is now a housewife.
   ``I felt the movie was an apology for Patty Hearst,'' said
Charles Bates, 68, now retired from the FBI's San Francisco bureau.
``I've talked to a lot of people who've committed crimes. Everybody
has an excuse, but I still believe people have to be responsible
for their conscious acts.''
   In a telephone interview from his Redwood City home, Bates said
he questioned how Ms. Hearst could know how long she was kept
blindfolded. He compared her ordeal to prisoners of war in Vietnam:
``People were held there for over five years. They were beaten and
deprived, and they didn't break and go over to the Viet Cong.''
   He criticized a film sequence showing uniformed San Francisco
police officers arresting Ms. Hearst. He said it was actually
plainclothes FBI agents and a police detective who captured her.

   The heavy metal band Iron Cross resorted to some
inventive measures to finance their first album, ``Church and
State,'' to be released in November.
   First the band tried to woo investors in a widely publicized
plea last year. But backers were apparently more interested in
precious metal than heavy metal, and the five raised only $1,500 of
the $15,000 they needed.
   ``So we had a raffle at the bowling alley,'' band leader leader
Rick Lang, an assistant manager of a North Side bowling alley, said
Monday. ``We took money out of our own pockets. I got married and
took half the money we got as gifts to finance the album.''
   The five members of the band _ guitarist Lang, singer John
Wiegand, bass player Rob Wilhelm, guitarist Dave Syzszko and
drummer Dennis Green _ cut the record at Seagrape Recording Studios
of Chicago, where their producer Mike Konopka is vice president.
   ``These guys have really shown they're small businessmen as well
as good musicians,'' Konopka said.

<HEAD>Canadians Shamed By Johnson's Loss Of Medal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadians were shamed, angry and saddened Tuesday
that national hero Ben Johnson was stripped of his Olympic gold
medal for using drugs to enhance his performance.
   ``I feel terribly sad for him,'' said Fergus Kilmartin, 36, of
Coquitlam, British Colombia. ``I don't believe he did it on
purpose. He hasn't got the guile to do that.''
   A disappointed nation awaited the return of the sprinter after a
urine sample was found to contain traces of anabolic steroids.
Canada's sole gold medal went to American Carl Lewis, who finished
second in the 100-meter dash.
   ``It puts a dent in Canada,'' said Scott Shaw, a 10th grade
student in Calgary, Alberta, said Tuesday.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who had thanked the Jamaican-born
runner for the ``thrill of a lifetime'' after his record-breaking
9.79-second performance Saturday, called the drug scandal ``a
moment of great sorrow for all Canadians.''
   Sports Minister Jean Charest, who called the incident ``a
national embarrassment,'' said Johnson will be banned from Canada's
national team for life. Charest said his government accepted the
validity of the tests and the suspension would be effective pending
an appeal from Johnson.
   But Johnson's family was left confused and outraged by the turn
of events.
   ``My brother is not guilty,'' a distaught Rodney told reporters
in her yard in the Toronto suburb of Rexdale. ``If you could cut
him into a million pieces and test him over again _ my brother is
not on drugs.''
   Outside the townhouse, police were called in to control the
crowd and the traffic. Throughout Monday evening, local children
attempted to raise a chorus of ``Ben! Ben! Ben!'' only to give up
when the crowd would not respond.
   ``We've just seen the destruction of a role model,'' said former
downhill skier Ken Read, of Calgary, now Canada's representative on
the International Olympic Committee's athletics commission.
   It was the second shock to national sports fans in recent
months. In August, fans were outraged when hockey legend Wayne
Gretzky, another national hero, was traded from the Edmonton Oilers
to the Los Angeles Kings.
   Some Canadian athletes expressed sympathy for Johnson.
   Mike Sokowski, a teammate at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los
Angeles, said: ``Ben's a pretty simple guy. Ben does not do drugs.
He did not knowingly do this.''
   Canadian speedskater Gaetan Boucher judged the sprinter harshly,
saying he has ``no respect'' for an athlete who takes drugs.
Boucher won two gold medals at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo,
Yugoslavia.
   Charest acknowledged that it was suggested to him several months
ago that Johnson might be using steroids.
   ``From time to time people would come to me in a private way _
and this happened one or two times ... that maybe Ben Johnson is
using steroids or other drugs,'' he said.
   He said the allegations came from no one officially connected
with the Olympic team and that he had heard similar, unfounded
allegations about other atheletes in the past.
   Johnson was last tested in Canada in February at a Montreal
laboratory.
   Charest said he didn't press Johnson to have a drug test because
he thought the sprinter was aware that medal winners at the
Olympics would be tested for drugs immediately following
competition.
   ``Everybody knew in advance that Mr. Johnson, if he wins a
medal, was going to be tested,'' said Charest.

<HEAD>Reagan Asks Allies to Share in Defense Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, in a farewell meeting
with West European and Pacific figures, said today that free
nations must work harder to share the cost of defense.
   In a meeting with officials of 18 European and Pacific allies,
including South Korea, Australia and Japan, the president raised
anew the question of alliance burden-sharing _ the persistent U.S.
plea that America's allies shoulder a larger share of the costs of
defending Western Europe.
   In reply, allied leaders underscored the heavy contributions
their governments were making to developing countries, and said
this should be considered a significant contribution to the joint
objectives of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``They spoke in the same general terms as the president,
recognizing that everyone must continue to do their share,'' said
Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway.
   She said that Reagan, who leaves office in about four months,
told the allied leaders that ``prosperity and security are
inextricably linked.''
   Winding up two days of meetings with a wide array of world
figures, Reagan also restated American condolences over the death
of Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul Haq.
   But he told reporters that he did not know the circumstances
behind Zia's death in an airplane crash.
   ``All I've heard are speculations and so forth,'' the president
said during a picture-taking session. ``I have not gotten an
official report yet from any of our people.''
   On Monday, Reagan told leaders of Persian Gulf states that the
U.S. decision to stop escorting individual ships represents ``just
a slight difference'' in the Navy's waterway policing operation.
   Posing for pictures with Sheik Jaber Al-Almed Al-Sabah, the emir
of Kuwait, Reagan said, ``We're not lessening our protection there
at all.''
   On a busy day in which the president made his swan-song visit to
the United Nations, Reagan also heard an upbeat assessment of
Middle East peace prospects and voiced new hope that American
hostages in Lebanon might be set free.
   But the meetings were dominated by talk of the administration's
decision to abandon the policy of escorting U.S-flagged ships
traveling the dangerous Persian Gulf oil shipping lanes.
   ``We didn't stop. This is just a slight difference,'' Reagan
said. ``It was a Navy decision made because of a change in the
situation in the Middle East.''
   U.S. officials said the threat to commercial shipping in the
area has waned since Aug. 20, when Iran and Iraq began observing a
U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy acknowledged during
a news briefing that the Kuwaiti leader had told Reagan he was
concerned that the United States ``keep open international shipping
channels.''
   Murphy said the move from individual ship escorts to a more
general U.S. military surveillance and protection operation
represents ``no significant reduction in our force levels and no
reduction in our commitment to help defend the freedom of
navigation.''
   ``There has been no overnight decision to drastically reduce the
forces within a set time frame,'' Murphy said. ``The position
remains, the forces will go down as the threat goes down.''
   During a separate picture-taking session with foreign ministers
Esmat Abdel Meguid of Egypt and Shimon Peres of Israel, Reagan
seemed to raise new hope for the release of American hostages,
although presidential aides insisted there were no new developments
to warrant optimism.
   ``We're encouraged,'' Reagan said when asked about chances the
nine Americans might be released. `` ... But I'm superstitious
about calling a no-hitter before the game is over.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, ``What he
said was, `I don't want to talk about hostages because it might be
bad luck.'''
   Meanwhile, Reagan got assurances from Meguid that the Palestine
Liberation Organization was trying to find a way to acknowledge
Israel's right to exist.
   That would meet a primary U.S. condition for dealing with Yasser
Arafat's organization, which all Arab governments recognize as the
sole representative of Palestinians.
   Reagan told Meguid and Peres that the U.S. goal was to move
beyond the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty to an overall
settlement that takes into account the ``legitimate rights'' of
Palestinian Arabs.
   According to Israeli sources who declined to be further
identified, Peres said his government would not deal with Arafat
and the PLO so long as they are involved in terrorism and violence
and speak of trying to force Israel back to the partition lines set
by the United Nations in 1947.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes Tax-Free Account; Dukakis Heads for Midwest</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Bush proposal in top 7 grafs, picking up in 5th
graf pvs, Dukakis was</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush proposed a tax-free savings account for
middle-income Americans today and also said he now thinks he did
better in Sunday night's debate than he thought at first. Michael
Dukakis campaigned in the Midwest as his campaign, pleased with his
debate performance, clipped excerpts for TV ads.
   Bush, in remarks prepared for delivery in Columbus, Ohio, said
his proposed account, under which $1,000 a year could be invested
tax free, would help Americans ``become better able to afford a
home, pay for college or start a business'' and would also
contribute to national economic strength.
   Under the plan, the money would have to be invested for at least
five years, and only people with adjusted gross income of less than
$60,000 would be eligible. Taxpayers with adjusted income between
$50,000 and $60,000 would get only a partial deduction.
   Bush's campaign estimated the program would cost the treasury
$70 million in 1989, with the amount increasing to $550 million by
1993.
   On the flight to Columbus, Bush also upgraded his assessment of
his performance in the debate Sunday night, saying, ``I feel better
today about the way the debate went than the night of the debate.''
   ``As I think I told you, I felt it was about even, and I now
think maybe we did a little better than that in terms of what we
needed to do. But I can't prove it.''
   Earlier today, at the University of Miami in Oxford, Ohio, Bush
said of Dukakis in the debate, ``We smoked him out'' and showed
Dukakis to be too liberal for American voters.
   Dukakis was campaigning today in Illinois, a crucial Midwest
battleground where 24 Electoral College votes are at stake.
   With their general election showdown six weeks away, the two
presidential candidates used post-debate, campaign appearances on
Monday to clarify statements from their first face-to-face
encounter.
   At a rally Monday in Jersey City, N.J., Dukakis sought to
distance himself from the American Civil Liberties Union, charging
that Bush was wrong when he ``suggested that I agree with every
position ever taken'' by the ACLU.
   The GOP nominee, however, refused to let the issue rest.
   ``My values are your values and they are not the values of the
ACLU,'' Bush told a rally and barbecue in Hampton, Ga., near
Atlanta.
   Aides to the vice president said Bush would hammer away at the
ACLU issue in the next few days as he attempts to portray the
Democratic nominee as a liberal out of the American mainstream.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was making his
first foray into Texas, with stops in Houston and El Paso. Quayle's
counterpart, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, was traveling to Detroit,
Mich., and Kansas City, Mo.
   On the day after the debate, four nationwide surveys found
little change in voter preference and underlying opinions of the
two candidates. The polls also showed that most Americans believe
Dukakis vs. Bush ended in a tie.
   A Los Angeles Times survey, however, found that Dukakis made
``major gains in stature'' by appearing more presidential and
standing up under the pressure.
   The Dukakis campaign produced two campaign ads showing excerpts
from the debate, including the Democratic nominee's summation that,
``The best America is not behind us. The best America is yet to
come.''
   Bush, meanwhile, rated the debate showdown a draw.
   ``I kind of thought it was even,'' said the GOP nominee hours
after many of his senior aides termed his performance a success.
   On Monday, Dukakis and his staff tackled the issue of the
Massachusetts governor's membership in the ACLU _ a clear
indication of the Democrat's liberal ways, according to Bush.
   During Sunday's debate, the vice president referred to Dukakis
as a ``card-carrying member'' of the ACLU and attacked some of the
organization's positions.
   Dukakis said Bush's efforts to link him to every ACLU stand is
``nonsense and he knows it.''
   ``Two months ago I signed one of the toughest child pornography
laws in the United States of America,'' Dukakis said. ``I've always
supported tax exemptions for religious institutions, and I
certainly do not support Oliver North who the ACLU is defending.''
   Bush and his aides tried to prevent the vice president's debate
comment that he hadn't ``sorted out'' possible criminal penalties
against women who obtain abortions from becoming a full-fledged
controversy.
   Campaign manager James A. Baker III said Bush gave the issue
more thought overnight and decided women are ``additional victims''
and should not be punished for undergoing abortions.
   But Bush still believes in the possibility of ``punishment as
far as the abortionist is concerned,'' if the courts overturn
current laws, Baker said.
   Bush told reporters at a rally in Jackson, Tenn., there was ``no
change'' in his stance.
   At the rally, a joint appearance for Bush and Quayle, the GOP
vice presidential nominee responded to Dukakis' debate comment that
``the notion of President Quayle is a very, very troubling notion
tonight.''
   For many, ``the notion of President Dukakis is a very, very
troubling notion today,'' Quayle said.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Interior Department Bill, But Calls It Budget-Buster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed a $10.5 billion Interior
Department appropriations bill Tuesday, but warned that it runs the
risk of triggering across-the-board budget cuts by exceeding the
spending level he proposed.
   Reagan also said the bill unfairly restricts offshore oil
leasing, but said that ``on balance the act merited my approval.''
   It was the fifth appropriations bill he has signed, leaving six
to come out of 13 that Congress annually considers.
   ``I urge the Congress to act swiftly to send me the remainder of
the fiscal year 1989 appropriations bill _ on time and on budget,''
he said.
   Reagan, who was in New York for the opening of the new United
Nations General Assembly, said the Interior Department measure
exceeds his request by $680 million and brings the federal budget
closer to sequestration under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction
act.
   ``This congressional overspending cannot continue if the nation
is to avoid the uniform, across-the-board cuts that a sequestration
inflicts equally on lower priority programs and on the high
priority programs upon which many Americans depend,'' he said.
   Regarding the congressional moratorium on granting oil and gas
leases for certain areas of the outer continental shelf, the
president said, ``The Congress increased the damaging effects of
the moratorium by extending it to apply to grants of permits for
drilling and exploration activities under leases already granted.''
   ``For the Congress to prohibit the issuance of such permits to
those who already had obtained leases is unfair,'' Reagan said.
   The president also said many provisions of the bill ``reflect a
growing and disturbing trend on the part of the Congress to include
unconstitutional committee approval or veto requirements in
appropriations bills.''
   He said the measure would require, for instance, the approval of
congressional committees to change Forest Service regional
boundaries, to close Forest Service regional offices or to reduce
personnel in the Indian Health Service.
   ``In granting authority or making appropriations by law, the
Congress may not reserve to its committees approval or veto power
over the exercise of that authority or the expenditure of those
appropriations,'' the president said.
   Since Congress ``has indicated such a special interest'' in
these matters, he said, the administration will consult the
lawmakers about them.

   The Soviet Union exercised its right for the
first time Tuesday to conduct a surprise inspection under the new
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Pentagon said.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said a
10-person team of Soviet inspectors had arrived earlier Tuesday at
the Rhein Main Air Base in West Germany and declared its intention
to conduct a so-called short-notice inspection.
   Under the treaty, the Soviets must inform the United States
which missile facility they want to inspect later Tuesday, the
spokesman added.
   The INF Treaty, which requires the elimination of all
intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear missiles, authorizes up to
20 short-notice inspections each calendar year for the next three
years. A smaller number of surprise visits are authorized during
each of the following 10 years.

   A six-story apartment house collapsed
today and slid down a steep mountainside in a wealthy district of
this northern industrial city. Officials said at least two people
were killed and others were trapped in the debris.
   At least two people survived the collapse, but both were
injured. The number of people trapped was not known.
   Francisco Javier Nakashima, an investigator with the state
judicial police, said the 3-year-old cement building collapsed
shortly before 9 a.m.
   ``One of the neighbors told us that six months ago they told the
architect that the building was loosening and and it was leaning,''
he said.
   Asked if the severe rains brought by Hurricane Gilbert 11 days
ago could have caused the collapse, he said: ``It had to have
something to do with it.''
   The bodies of a man and a boy were removed from the collapsed
building, Nakashima said.
   The building, which had one apartment to a floor, collapsed like
a pancake into a pile about one story high, and part of it slid
about 30 feet down the mountain. Mattresses, clothing and furniture
were strewn over the area.
   Perched high in the wealthy district of San Pedro Garza Garcia,
it was one of the highest buildings in Monterrey.
   Ruben Salinas Garcia, 27, was sleeping in his second floor
apartment when the building collapsed. ``I woke up and the roof was
on top of me,'' he said. He said his maid apparently was trapped
inside the builidng.
   His face and pink T-shirt were covered with blood and his chin
covered with white gauze bandage.
   Humberto Junco said his 19-month-old granddaughter, Ingrid
Junco, and a maid were inside his son's third floor apartment at
the time of the collapse. They have not been found, he said.
   A block down the street, the girl's weeping mother was attended
by neighbors.
   Francisco Rodriguez Loredo, an ambulance driver, said he took
two bodies from the scene and transported a survivor, a man about
25 years old, to Monterrey's Civil Hospital. The man appeared to
have broken ribs, he said.
   Gilbert caused heavy flooding in Monterrey. At least 140 people,
most of them passengers on buses, were swept away when water rushed
through the normally dry bed of the Santa Catarina River.
   Monterrey is Mexico's third largest city, with 2 million
residents, and the capital of the state of Nuevo Leon. It is a
major steel- and beer-producing city, and is located about 120
miles southwest of Laredo, Texas.

   Former Democratic vice presidential nominee
Geraldine Ferraro says both Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush did well in Sunday night's debate, but Bush's success
came ``probably because I taught him how to do it.''
   Ms. Ferraro, who debated Bush during the 1984 campaign, also
said her unsuccessful campaign would continue to be significant
until a woman is elected to the White House.
   ``I have a place in history,'' she said Monday night before a
speech at Emory University. ``And I'll have that place in history
until a woman runs and wins. Then I'll fade into the woodwork.''
   Ms. Ferraro, a former New York congresswoman, was the running
mate chosen by Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale,
making her the only woman ever nominated for president or vice
president by a major political party.
   The 1984 Democratic ticket suffered one of the worst defeats
ever in a presidential race.

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the fighting fast and furious on
the Olympic fields, the rice paddies of Panmunjom seem eerily calm.
   On this no-man's land in limbo between South and North Korea,
just an hour's ride from Seoul, the battle being waged is one of
symbols.
   The only clear signs of the momentous sports gathering 30 miles
away is an Olympic flag taunting North Korea and the signature of
Olympic swimming star Matt Biondi in the visitors' book at Camp
Bonifas, the forward U.N. command at the Demilitarized Zone.
   More than halfway through the Olympics, fears of an attack by
North Korea against the Games have receded.
   In fact, the communist North, which had sought to co-host the
games with its archrival, appears to be studiously ignoring the
international sports meet.
   ``They haven't even attacked the Games in their propaganda,''
said U.S. Air Force Capt. David Griffard, who serves with the U.N.
command.
   Griffard is one of 375 people stationed at Camp Bonifas,
adjacent to the site of Quonset huts where regular meetings are
held with the North to discuss violations of the 1953 armistice
agreement that ended the three-year Korean War.
   Since the Olympics began, most of the commentary from the
North's loudspeakers focuses on the disappointment of South Korean
students that the Games were not being held jointly in Seoul and
Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, he said.
   Radical South Korean students, seeking unification with the
North, staged violent protests against the Olympics in the months
leading up to the Games, but their demonstrations have declined
since the competitions began last week.
   The men of Camp Bonifas, about half of whom are South Koreans,
have also noticed that the North is cranking up its loudspeaker
music a little more for the constant stream of tourists visiting
the DMZ.
   The blasts of music _ a mixture of oriental and Western tunes _
are sometimes accompanied by praise for ruler Kim Il Sung and
exhortations to South Koreans to defect.
   But the South's propaganda machine is just as persistent as the
North's.
   The South Koreans are encouraging visitors and reporters to take
the opportunity to tour Panmunjom, making this the hottest
attraction after the Games.
   As many as 18 tour buses a day cross the narrow wood-planked
Freedom Bridge spanning the mine-strewn Imjin River and leading to
the DMZ. Tours offered to reporters and photographers covering the
Olympics are booked days in advance.
   The visit begins with a 25-minute slide presentation,
accompanied by a profusion of facts and figures about the DMZ
rattled off by a U.S. officer:
   Symbols abound. The Americans call the mostly uninhabited Gijung
Dong ``propaganda village.'' The pagoda-like building which serves
as headquarters for the U.S. and South Korean armistice officers is
known as Freedom House.
   Less than 100 yards away, North Korean soldiers snap photos of
the visiting reporters and peer at them through binoculars. ``Don't
make any gestures to them,'' the media group is warned.
   Visitors must be dressed properly _ no jeans, shorts or
sneakers: ``We don't want them to think we're decadent,'' says Lt.
Robert Feliu, accompanying the group.
   The troops who patrol the zone must be over 6 feet tall and over
180 pounds in weight. The North Koreans tend to be shorter. ``The
purpose is intimidation, pure intimidation,'' says Feliu.
   In the battle of North-South oneupmanship, as on the Olympic
fields, every inch counts.
   So when the North raised its flag pole to 330 feet, the South
followed suit, although the North has since upped it to 528 feet,
and the South has yet to match it.
   North Korea's headquarters building in the Joint Security Area,
where the armistice talks are held, is about a yard higher and
longer than the adjacent U.N. headquarters, says Cpl. Dale
Adkinson, another military explainer. ``But it's much narrower than
ours,'' Adkinson adds with satisfaction.
   The U.S. and South Korean troops at the DMZ are ever at the
ready. Nothing special for the Olympics, says Adkinson.
   So on an autumn day in Panmunjom, the men feel as bored as ever.
The only highlight of their day is the Olympic competition being
beamed to them from Seoul, one hour and a world away.

<HEAD>Wrights Expects House Committees To Drop Complaints</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 8th graf, Asked whether, with 2 grafs to update with
Foley declining to say what he had told Wright.</NOTE>

   House Speaker Jim Wright predicts the two
House committees that have been asked to investigate his disclosure
of CIA efforts to provoke the Nicaraguan government will drop the
complaints.
   Wright, speaking to a small group of reporters on Monday, said
he expects the Intelligence and ethics committees to agree with his
contention that legislators have the right to comment on executive
branch covert activities.
   ``They'll dismiss it,'' Wright said of the GOP complaint to the
committees. ``Surely it has no merit. It has no merit at all.''
   Wright, D-Texas, also repeated his assertion that he did not
reveal any classified information.
   ``I can't conceive of any committee of the House taking the
position that the speaker is inhibited from expressing his
convictions on something that is in the public domain,'' he said.
``I have not only the right but the responsibility to express my
views.''
   He added: ``I would just like to be credited with at least
telling the truth.''
   But Wright again declined to say specifically where he got his
information on the covert CIA activity that he disclosed a week
ago. Wright's disclosure of what he termed U.S. attempts to provoke
overreaction by the Sandinista government prompted formal calls
from Republicans for an investigation.
   Asked whether he had been briefed on the CIA operation in
Nicaragua by the No. 2 official in the House, Majority Leader
Thomas Foley, D-Wash., Wright said ``I don't have any recollection
of his briefing me,'' and referred further questions to Foley.
   Foley today declined to say what he had told Wright on the
subject, saying his conversations with the speaker were private. A
Foley spokesman said yesterday that his boss hado member. ``I'm not going
to discuss my
private conversations with members of Congress.''
   ``The fact that a matter is classified, secret, doesn't mean
it's sacrosanct and immune from criticism,'' Wright said. He cited
as examples the mining of Nicaraguan harbors by the CIA in 1984 and
the agency's efforts to overthrow Salvador Allende in Chile in the
1970s, both of which eventually leaked out.
   It is against House rules to disclose classified information
conveyed to the Intelligence Committee. Suspected violations of the
rule must be investigated by the ethics committee, known formally
as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.
   The committee met for two hours on Friday and adjourned without
deciding how to proceed on the investigation request, filed by
House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and Rep. Dick Cheney,
R-Wyo., chairman of the House Republican Conference.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said he was
conferring with Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Louis Stokes,
D-Ohio, about how to proceed.
   The controversy began Sept. 20 when Wright told reporters there
had been ``clear testimony'' from the CIA about agency efforts to
stir up civil unrest in Nicaragua in hopes of provoking a
Sandinista overreaction that would dash peace talks. Wright said
then that the information had been provided by the spy agency under
congressional questioning.
   Since the disclosure provoked an outcry from Republicans and
intelligence officials, the Democratic leadership has been
scrambling to shift the focus to the question of whether the
administration action was proper at a time when it was voicing
public support for the peace talks.

<HEAD>Quayle's Looks: Do Women Care?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some may swoon, but others demand, ``Can he
type?'' Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle is making an impression on women
but it's not always the one Republican strategists may have had in
mind.
   When Quayle catapulted to prominence as the GOP vice
presidential nominee, it was hard to ignore two facts: Other
Republicans were far more experienced, and Quayle, blond and
fresh-faced, possessed striking good looks.
   ``I can't believe a guy that handsome wouldn't be attractive in
some respect'' to women, said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., at the GOP
convention in August.
   ``Anyone that good-looking must stand for really good things,''
said a supposedly surveyed woman in a recent Doonesbury comic
strip. ``I think most women want a really hot guy to be in charge
of the country,'' agreed her friend.
   McCain wasn't kidding. But the mock Doonesbury poll should have
been ``adjusted for sarcasm,'' according to the strip.
   Experts disagree on whether Quayle will help attract women to
the GOP ticket headed by Vice President George Bush. He's been
credited with narrowing the gender gap, but he's also been compared
to a ``Ken'' doll _ ``Barbie'' doll's friend _ and labeled a
hindrance rather than a help for Bush.
   When actor Tom Selleck escorted Nancy Reagan to the podium at
the convention, ``I saw grown women faint and moan,'' said GOP
consultant Ann Stone. ``There are a lot of women where (physical
appearance) still is important. ... I don't think Quayle has the
charisma of Selleck. But that still has some impact.''
   Ann Lewis, a Democratic consultant and Ms. Magazine columnist,
sniffed at the thought. ``Candidates that would pass a Hollywood
screen test do not do noticeably better than candidates that would
flunk it. Looking at the House of Representatives will bear this
out,'' she said.
   On the other hand, former actor Ronald Reagan has had some
political success.
   Recent polls showed Bush had erased a 20-point gender gap and
was winning as much support from women as Michael Dukakis, the
Democratic nominee.
   Democrats say Quayle had nothing to do with this development.
But GOP consultant Eddie Mahe said Quayle has been the only
variable in the race since the conventions; thus ``you could hardly
make the case that he's not a factor.''
   At rallies across the country, Quayle has encountered a mixed
reception. Some placards carry messages such as ``But Can He
Type?'' and ``Women Don't Vote For Men Prettier Than They Are.''
But many women eagerly press forward to hear and touch him.
   Lewis predicted Quayle would attract women who would have voted
for the GOP ticket anyway.
   ``He may cause some excitement at parties and gatherings, but he
doesn't cause vote-switching among undecided or independent women
voters,'' she said. ``Right now he is the biggest single danger to
eorge Bush's election. He is a land mine that George Bush planted
in his own territory.''
   Republicans claim Quayle has more than sex appeal to offer women
voters, and hold up his marriage as exhibit A. Quayle's wife,
Marilyn, is a lawyer taking off more than a decade to raise the
couple's three children.
   ``A lot of women in that age group of his wife, professional
women staying home to raise the children, can relate to that
family,'' said Mahe. ``They feel that he understands working wives,
women as professionals.''
   Marilyn Quayle is ``the epitome of the modern woman,'' said
Stone. ``That says a lot about him, that he has a partner that
strong.''
   Lewis said, ``If I were a partisan Republican desperately
looking for something good to think or say about Dan Quayle,
Marilyn Quayle would be the best example I could think of.''
   Mrs. Quayle herself blamed the pretty-face controversy on the
news media and recently declared, ``George Bush wouldn't have
selected someone who could not stand in his stead for president.''
   But Democrats beg to differ.
   ``He just goes to prove that the word airhead is not sexist,''
said Democratic media consultant Bob Squier. ``It's like Dorian
Gray for vice president. There's this pretty face out there
campaigning, but someplace up in an attic somewhere is a portrait
of this guy which is painted by his record.''
   Some women have reacted with outrage to the notion that they
would vote for a candidate because he's cute. And despite heated
denials that Quayle was chosen for that reason, some Democrats see
the possibility of a backlash against him.
   ``Women will look at this thing as an appalling, cynical, sexist
decision,'' said Squier. ``In the end, his negative rating will be
higher among women than Bush's.''
   ``What is off-putting is that everything in his life has been so
easy for him,'' said Lewis. If Quayle were less handsome, she said,
``at least it would have been one thing in life he had to
overcome.''
   Well, maybe there is something Quayle has had to overcome: his
good looks.
   Jim Ciccone, an issues strategist for Quayle, says the senator
``fights the pretty face thing almost like a woman does. There's a
predisposition to think he doesn't have a brain. He's really very
intelligent and that's going to come out in the course of the
campaign.''

<HEAD>Japan To Kill Hundreds Of Whales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan plans to kill about 300 whales this winter in
a research project aimed at proving there are enough of the mammals
to resume commercial hunting, government officials said Tuesday.
   A similar plan last year was sharply criticized by international
environmental groups, which accused Japan of conducting the
experiment to circumvent an international ban on commerical whaling.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Japan
recently submitted the whaling plan to the International Whaling
Commission for review, but decided not to publicize its contents
until the evaluation was complete.
   They said Japan planned to catch ``very close'' to 300 minke
whales in the Antarctic this winter. The species is estimated by
the commission to number more than 430,000 worldwide.
   The Japanese government says research whaling is necessary to
assess whale stocks, and such factors as age, sex and health.
Japanese officials say they hope the research will prove there are
adequate numbers of some whale species, such as the minke, to allow
a resumption of limited commercial whaling.
   Last year, Japan told the commission it would kill 875 minke and
sperm whales for research purposes, but strong opposition from
international environmental groups and other commission members
reduced the catch to 273 minke whales, according to officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The officials said this year's research methods will be similar
to those practiced last year, when ships sailed along a fixed route
and killed only one or two whales in each group sighted.
   In 1982, the commission passed an international ban on
commercial whaling to allow scientists to study whale populations
without hunting pressure. The ban went into effect in 1986 and is
to be re-evaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research results.
   Japan officially ended its commercial whaling in Antarctica at
the end of the 1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 of the mammals.
   The commission's charter allows member nations to conduct
research whaling without approval from the 42-member body.
   Environmentalists have charged that Japan _ where whale meat has
long been an important protein source _ is using the research
provision to maintain its whaling industry. Japanese officials say
other commission members have not been serious about conducting
research during the moratorium and plan merely to renew the ban in
1990.
   ``In the Antarctic, only Japan is conducting research,'' one
official said, speaking anonymously. ``The people who are
criticizing Japan are not presenting any data of their own.''

   Journalists are flocking here at
record rates to cover the launch of the first U.S. manned
spaceflight since the Challenger disaster shook certainty about the
space program's safety.
   At least 5,000 journalists had asked for credentials by Tuesday
to cover the Discovery mission, scheduled for liftoff Thursday
morning.
   ``Everybody thought shuttle flights were routine. Challenger
proved it's a risky business,'' said Robert Hotz, former editor of
Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine and a member of the
presidential commission that investigated the Challenger explosion
32 months ago.
   All four national television networks will cover the launch live
this time. Only CNN had live coverage when the Challenger exploded
73 seconds after liftoff, claiming the seven astronauts' lives.
   Jerry Hannifin, a Time magazine correspondent who has covered
every manned space mission, recalled one colleague's decision
several years ago to stop covering launches routinely. ``To his
embarrassment now, he said the shuttle was just like a 747 taking
off.
   ``But we're not sitting here on a body watch,'' Hannifin said.
``The U.S. return to manned spaceflight is the biggest story of
this decade and it's our mission to inform our readers.''
   ``It's frightening because we don't know if everything will be
OK,'' said Judith Weiner, reporter for France-Soir newspaper. ``But
it is also exhilarating.''
   She was among the large foreign press contingent, including
representatives from China, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil,
Iceland, Italy and more than a dozen other nations that have been
accredited. Two Soviet journalists asked for credentials, then
canceled.
   ``Public interest in the space program has continued to grow,''
said Dick Young, NASA spokesman at the busy press center.
   ``There's a zoo out there,'' he added.
   Young and other NASA officials were also dealing with news
representatives upset about unprecedented plans to restrict the
number of journalists covering the launch at the press center,
about four miles from the launchpad. The restrictions follow Air
Force recommendations that cited safety concerns.
   Discovery accreditation requests are the most ever received for
a space mission. Young said in the past, about 70 percent of those
accredited have shown up.
   The previous record for journalists was 2,700 at the first
shuttle launch and about the same number at the Apollo 11 and
Apollo 17 moon missions. There were 1,467 for Challenger.
   ``This is a significant piece of American history,'' said Mark
Kramer, a CBS News special events producer coordinating the
network's 100-person operation here. ``This is not a packaged story
like the national conventions, where the outcome is known.''
   CBS coverage will include Wednesday and Thursday ``Evening
News'' broadcasts from the cape with anchor Dan Rather and live
coverage of the launch.
   ABC, with anchor Peter Jennings, and NBC, with Tom Brokaw, also
will carry live coverage of the launch and anchor their news shows
from the space center. CNN will have anchor Bernard Shaw leading
its live coverage.
   The networks were working out of new, larger buildings
constructed since the Challenger launch.
   Young said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
accredits virtually anyone who is a legitimate journalist. College
journalists are accredited, although the space administration draws
the line at high school reporters.
   Only 1,800 of the journalists will be permitted at the press
center, and NASA has set up a second press area 7.5 miles from the
launchpad for the remainder.
   The restrictions resulted from an Air Force study spurred by the
Challenger accident and the subsequent explosion of a Titan rocket
launched from Kennedy Space Center. The study calls the press
center hazardous because of the possibility of debris from an
explosion falling near the launch site.
   Young said the 1,800 figure would permit all news media under
deadline pressure adequate coverage. But some veteran space
reporters were angered by the restriction. Rep. Bill Nelson,
D-Fla., who flew on a shuttle mission, also protested.
   ``We do not feel NASA is in the position to tell us how many
people we need to cover a story. On principle, we will never buy
that,'' said Edward H. Kolcum, a senior editor for Aviation Week.

<TEXT>
   Some Burmese fleeing to frontier areas
claimed Tuesday they saw troops execute anti-government protesters,
and a newly formed opposition group accused the military government
of torture.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon say there are increasing reports of
executions of lower-level, anti-government leaders but they have
yet to be confirmed.
   The opposition League for Democracy league issued the torture
charge in a statement Tuesday, which said:
   ``It (the league) condemns and demands immediate ending of
irresponsible and illegal acts of arrests, torture and killings in
Rangoon and other towns.''
   The statement provided no other details.
   The coalition also named retired army officer Aung Gyi as its
chairman, former defense minister Tin Oo as vice chairman and Aung
San Suu Kyi, daughter of slain independence leader Aung San, as
general secretary and spokeswoman.
   Aung Gyi immediately called for an interim government to replace
the military government of Gen. Saw Maung, which took power in a
Sept. 18 coup and cracked down on nationwide street demonstrations.
   The government announced Tuesday that 348 persons had been
killed nationwide, 219 others wounded and 1,107 arrested since
Sept. 18. But the government has not mentioned actual executions of
detainees.
   The government previously acknowledged more than 250 deaths but
has not mentioned executions. Western diplomats believe troops
killed up to 400 civilians in the first few days after the coup.
   In Ghay Baw Bo near the Thailand border, some Burmese said the
executions took place as people protesting 26 years of
authoritarian rule fled to areas of Burma controlled by Karen
guerrillas.
   Soe Hlaing, a 36-year-old lawyer from Pegu, said he saw nine
people executed by soldiers on a bridge in the town of Tharrawdy
during his flight.
   ``Each was shot with a gun. One bullet to the heart,'' Soe
Hlaing said.
   A student from the Rangoon Institute of Technology said he
witnessed the ``sysematic killing'' of 10 people in Mudon, south of
the coastal city of Moulmein. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Most of the alleged killings occurred after Saw Maung sent
troops into the streets of Rangoon and other cities to put down
massive anti-government demonstrations.
   The League for Democracy, formed Saturday, united Burma's
traditionally fragmented opposition to revitalize the
anti-government movement after the military crackdown.
   A league official announced the leadership appointments. Nine of
12 Executive Committee members also were named with the open seats
reserved for ethnic minorities also fighting the central government.
   Aung Gyi said the group believes ``that (an) interim government
is the only way to solve the present crisis in the country.''
   Saw Maung has promised the first multiparty elections since 1960
but has not set a timetable. He has not responded to calls for an
interim government.
   The league also said Tuesday it ``firmly supports the general
strike being staged by the government servants and workers, and
urges the strikers to continue until the movement for democracy
achieves its goal.''
   Saw Maung has ordered civil servants, who left their jobs Aug. 8
to protest political repression and economic decline, to returned
to work by Monday.
   Although the government claims some workers are back on the job,
business remains crippled.

   Hog producers and importers have voted
overwhelmingly to continue mandatory assessments to promote pork
and help boost the image of the swine industry, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Assistant Secretary Kenneth A. Gilles said 33,534 or 77 percent
of the 43,532 valid ballots cast were in favor of the checkoff
plan. Only a simple majority was needed for approval.
   The department conducted the referendum Sept. 7-8 at county
offices.
   Gilles said that since a majority supported the program, the
National Pork Board, which administers the program, will continue
to collect the assessments of one quarter of 1 percent of the
market value of all hogs and pigs sold in the United States and an
equivalent amount on ``all imported porcine animals, pork and pork
products.''
   The USDA issued its order setting up the program on Sept. 5,
1986, and assessments began on Nov. 1, 1986. But the 1985 law
authorizing the program specified a referendum on the checkoff
within 24 months to 30 months.
   Voting by state, as reported by USDA, is shown here, with the
vote for the checkoff program in the first column and the vote
against it in the second:

   A comatose police academy cadet, one of 16
overcome last week by strenuous training, underwent a liver
transplant today, but officials said an investigation showed no
evidence that he or others had been abused at the academy.
   At a news conference, the officials said the training was
routine for the first day at the academy, including repeated heavy
exercise.
   Dr. George Grady, the chief state epidemiologist, had said
earlier that his preliminary examination last week found ``it's
very clear the exercise was stressful.''
   But he said today that further investigation found ``at this
time that the cause of the illness was a relatively insufficient
intake of water relative to the amount of exercise they were
doing.''
   Gary Egan, executive director of the Massachusetts Criminal
Justice Training Council, said, ``There was strenuous physical
activities, as there always was on that first day ... (but) we have
found no one that was denied water upon request.''
   Asked if his conclusion was that it was the fault of individual
cadets that they took ill, Egan said, ``Some of them were unware of
the fact that they were doing damage to themselves.'' Earlier, some
cadets had said they had been given only a small amount of water
the day the cadets had taken ill.
   Timothy Shepard, 25, of Pittsfield, who has been in a weeklong
coma, entered surgery Monday night for a liver transplant at
Pittsburgh's Presbyterian Hospital.
   Rose Eberts, hospital nursing administrator, would say only that
Shepard's condition was critical this morning.
   Pittsfield Mayor Anne Everest Wojtkowski, who is acting as a
spokeswoman for the Shepard family, said said the surgery was
completed at 5:30 a.m. today and the family was told that Shepard
came through the operation ``very well.''
   Shepard was the most seriously ailing cadet after last week's
series of illnesses swept the Edward J. Connelly Criminal Justice
Training Center in Agawam just south of Springfield.
   Several former cadets have suffered similar fatigue-related
medical problems at the academy over the past four years, according
to former cadets and an Amherst physician.
   Dr. Constance Lentz said she treated between three and eight
police recruits from Holyoke in 1984 after they were overcome on
the first day of training at the academy.
   Among the 16 cadets who were hospitalized beginning Sept. 19,
the first day of classes, ailments ranged from dark urine to
exhaustion and dehydration.
   Although several stricken cadets refused to be interviewed
Monday without clearance from superiors, one former trainee said
the training routine was severe.
   ``I've been through basic training in the Army and it was twice
as bad as that,'' said Mike Purcell, who quit the academy after one
day. ``The doctors told me that if I had gone back for a second
day, I could have suffered permanent kidney damage.''
   After Shepard collapsed while running Sept. 19, instructors
allowed the recruits to drink two small cups of water, Purcell
said. ``Before that, they had lined us up at the bubbler twice
during the day and only let us take one cup of water each.''
   Six recruits remained hospitalized Monday.
   Several local officials, including Wojkowski and North Adams
Mayor John Barrett III, asked the state attorney general's office
to review the training program.
   Wojkowski met Monday with Egan and state police Capt. Thomas
White of the Agawam academy.
   ``I was completely dissatisfied with their responses,''
Wojkowcki said. ``I suspect that the incidents are not isolated.''
   Shepard was in top shape and had worked out more than six months
preparing for the academy, said his brother, Thomas Jr. ``He really
wanted to be a policeman,'' the brother said.
   Jeff Grossman, a spokesman for the state office of public
safety, said Shepard's condition may have resulted in part from a
``self-induced, severe diet.''
   But Thomas Shepard said his brother spent the days before
reporting to the academy with his family and ate normally.

<HEAD>Carter Center Helps Distribute Pill That Prevents River Blindness</HEAD>

   A pill that prevents heartworms in Jimmy Carter's
bird dogs also halts a parasite that blinds thousands of Third
World residents, and the former president is helping to make sure
that it reaches them.
   The Task Force for Child Survival, a public health foundation
based at the Carter Presidential Center, is overseeing a worldwide
system to get the drug Mectizan to the 85 million people at risk
for the tropical disease.
   Mectizan is the commercial name for invermectin, used by
veterinarians to treat heartworms in dogs and other parasites in
cattle and swine.
   Carter discussed his organization's role in the program in a
recent telephone interview from his home in Plains.
   ``I've got two bird dogs and one of my constant problems is that
my dogs get heartworms,'' Carter said. ``When a mosquito bites a
dog, a little microorganism goes through the body and winds up in
the dog's heart and causes heartworms.
   ``Mectizan is very effective against heartworm not only with
dogs but with other animals. And it also proves to be effective
against river blindness because river blindness is caused by the
sting of a little fly that grows in very rapidly flowing streams,''
said the former president.
   River blindness, formally known as onchnocerciasis, is caused by
a parasitic worm spread by the fly. It has infected 27.5 million
people in more than 30 countries, mostly in Africa and Latin
America; 350,000 have been blinded.
   One dose of Mectizan kills the adult worm's millions of tiny
offspring and prevents the adult from reproducing for a year. It is
the worm's offspring, called microfilaria, that cause the symptoms
of the disease, including skin lesions, severe itching and the
blinding eye lesions.
   The medicine halts the progress of the disease but does not
reverse damage already caused by microfilaria. A person bitten by
the fly who takes Mectizan once a year for the eight-to-12-year
life cycle of the adult worm will be free of the disease unless he
is reinfected by another fly bite.
   Mectizan, derived from acids produced by a bacterium found in
Japanese soil, is manufactured by Merck & Co. The Rahway, N.J.,
pharmaceutical company began developing the drug for humans in 1980.
   Another heartworm medicine for dogs, diethylcarbamazine, has
been found effective in fighting a parasitic disease called
loiasis, prevalent in western and central Africa. The disease is
caused by the loa loa, or African eyeworm, and it is spread by
biting flies that feed on human blood. The disease can cause heart
and kidney damage.
   The World Health Organization has been fighting river blindness
for years. WHO and Merck spent seven years on research trials
before Mectizan was approved for human use by French drug officials
last year, clearing the way for worldwide distribution.
   Carter said Merck has volunteered to make the drug available
worldwide and free of charge. The company said last year that
building a distribution network was its only remaining roadblock.
   That's where Carter's organization comes in. Merck and WHO said
they wanted an independent committee of experts to review the
organizations set up to distribute the drug, to monitor any adverse
reactions and to keep records on the permanent distribution program.
   The Mectizan Expert Committee is chaired by Dr. William H.
Foege, executive director of the Carter Center and a former
director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, who was
instrumental in organizing the worldwide smallpox eradication
program.
   Next month the committee will begin reviewing the first
applications for the program, clearing the way for Merck to start
shipping the medicine to high-risk areas.

<HEAD>Failure Rate Has Hospitals Scrambling For Replacements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failure rate on the national nursing
exam given in July went up across the country, and in Kentucky that
exacerbated a nursing shortage in hospitals, nursing homes and
other health-care facilities.
   Nursing-school graduates can work as registered nurses until
their test results arrive but those who fail lost their positions,
and that has left the industry scrambling to find replacements.
   ``It's terrible timing,'' said Carolyn A. Williams, dean of the
University of Kentucky School of Nursing, who worries that the bad
results also will scare young people away from a nursing career.
   Nationally, 16.4 percent of people who took the two-day exam for
the first time in July failed, said Carolyn Yocom, director of
research services for the National Council of State Boards of
Nursing, which prepares the exam.
   That is the highest failure rate since the council started the
exam in 1982. Last year, just 9 percent of first-time test takers
failed, and in previous years the failure rate ranged from 8
percent to 12 percent, Yocom said.
   The failure rate increased in all 50 states, she said. The
failure rate in Kentucky was about 20 percent, up from 10 percent
in July 1987 and 8 percent to 12 percent in previous years, said
Patricia Calico, president of the Kentucky Board of Nursing.
   Michael Rush, vice president for member services of the Kentucky
Hospital Association, said a survey the association did in 1987
found that one in 10 registered-nurse positions in Kentucky
hospitals was unfilled.
   ``We're in a real bind,'' said Bill Massie, chief operating
officer of the University of Kentucky's Albert B. Chandler Medical
Center.
   The UK Medical Center already had closed three
intensive-care-unit beds because it didn't have enough nurses,
Massie said.
   Changes in the test partly help explain the higher failure rate.
This year's test covered new subjects to reflect the changing
skills and knowledge required of entry-level nurses, Yocom said.
   Also, the number of correct answers needed to pass was
increased, but by fewer than 10 out of the total of 300 questions
asked, she said. The council won't reveal how many correct answers
are needed to pass the test.
   Yocom said the council expected the failure rate to increase but
not by as much as it did.
   She said changes in the exam accounted for only half the
increase. She theorized that increasing opportunities for women in
other professions, night and weekend hours in many health-care
settings, and non-competitive salaries have prompted fewer
top-quality people to enter nursing.
   The Kentucky Board of Nursing has asked the national council to
offer the exam three times a year instead of twice so nurses can
get into the work force more quickly. The next scheduled exam is in
February, and by the time those results come out, nurses who failed
in July but pass in February would not be able to start work until
about April.

<TEXT>
   The newly arrived U.S. ambassador in Beirut
has begun meeting rival Lebanese leaders, urging restraint and
support for a peaceful presidential election according to the
country's constitution, the State Department said Tuesday.
   ``Our highest priority now is to urge restraint on all parties
and to emphasize the contribution they can make to peaceful
constitutional presidential elections,'' department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said.
   Ambassador John McCarthy arrived from the United States over the
weekend. On Tuesday he talked with Michel Aoun, the Christian
general appointed by outgoing President Amin Gemayel to head a
military government, as well as acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss
and Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, both Moslems, she said.
   Aoun's government has been rejected by the Moslem majority,
which recognizes only the Hoss Cabinet, and reports from Beirut
said the appointment pushed the country closer to formal partition.
   Mrs. Oakley said the ambassador's meetings were undertaken ``in
the context of maintaining contact with ... as many of the Lebanese
groups and leaders important to the political process as possible
under existing security conditions.
   ``With a successful election, the Lebanese can begin to restore
the functioning of government and initiate the process of reform
and reconciliation that Lebanon needs,'' she added.
   Although the size of the U.S. Embassy has been reduced because
of insecure living conditions in Beirut, ``all essential embassy
functions are continuing,'' and McCarthy and his staff will
continue to ``maintain as broad contact as possible,'' Mrs. Oakley
said.
   She had no comment on a Beirut report that Aoun had banned
direct helicopter flights to the Embassy.

   Hotel rooms are overflowing, motor homes
are jamming the roadways and business people are laughing all the
way to the bank as they hope to welcome up to 1 million visitors
for Discovery's launch on Thursday.
   ``We're looking at megabucks,'' exulted Joe Catrambone,
executive vice president of the Titusville Area Chamber of Commerce.
   Green bows were on virtually everyone's dress or lapel, in
keeping with the Space Coast's ``Green for Shuttle Go'' tourist
slogan. Green is appropriate, too, because of the many greenbacks
expected to be rung up on cash registers all over Brevard County.
   ``My business had increased 10 times over the last few months,''
said Mada Davis, owner of a souvenir shop in Cocoa Beach.
   Police, county and local officials anticipate one of the biggest
launch crowds since the Apollo moon missions and the first shuttle
launch in 1981. Some visitor estimates are upwards of 1 million.
   While business owners and tourism executives beat the drums
welcoming visitors, others are bracing for a traffic nightmare and
rushing to set up medical aid stations, portable toilets and
temporary food stands.
   ``Can you imagine about a million people wanting to go to the
bathroom at about the same time?'' joked Ralph McMullen, director
of the county's Tourist Development Agency.
   Brevard County, which prefers the tag ``Space Coast,'' has only
8,300 hotel-motel rooms and some 4,000 campsites, and they were all
reported full on Tuesday.
   Among those not having to sweat and jostle for viewing spaces
along the Indian River banks, at Jetty Point Park or on the NASA
causeway will be more than 2,000 special NASA guests who will be
ushered to a site on the Space Center grounds. These include at
least 50 members of Congress, a Saudi Arabian prince, actor John
Travolta, actress Darryl Hannah, a couple of Cabinet members and
former astronauts.
   The VIPs ``have shown an interest in NASA, and they may ``convey
the experience to other people,'' said space agency spokesman Mitch
Varnes.
   Adding to the throng of big-spending tourists is a record crowd
of journalists, many of whom came early and plan to stay late. More
than 5,000 requests for credentials were received by NASA, said
space agency spokesman Dick Young, and of that about 70 percent
were expected to be here.
   ``The media are spending money everywhere,'' said McMullen.
   It's just like old times for some veteran bartenders, said
Norman Kolsch, operator of Rainbows bar and restaurant in Cocoa
Beach, which is doing a heavy business in a concoction named
``Shuttle Shooters.''
   The red, white and blue combination of grenadine, cocoa creme
and a mint-flavored blue liqueur is so popular that he's thinking
of putting on extra help just to keep up with the demand.
   ``It's really a big challenge and damn hard work dealing with
the big numbers,'' said Catrambone. ``But we'll take it in stride,
just like we always do.''
   He expects some quarter-million visitors in the immediate area
around Titusville, a town of about 43,000. Police Chief Charles
Ball expects 100,000 of them to line the banks of the Indian River,
which is directly across from the launchpad, about 12 miles away.
On Tuesday, cars, motor homes and recreational vehicles were
already pulling in to stake out claims for good viewing spots.
   In all the hoopla, many residents along the Space Coast were not
forgetting the horror of the last launch.
   At a special Mass last week, some 250 elementary schoolchildren
prayed for a safe mission for Discovery and its five astronauts.
Several of the youngsters remembered seeing the Challenger
explosion through their school windows on Jan. 28, 1986.
   But most were optimistic, reflecting the generally prevailing
mood.
   ``They've had time to fix all those things that were wrong. I'm
excited,'' said 9-year-old Jenna Rose.

   A couple that cared for 11 foster
children and lost their house in a fire hope to move this weekend
into a new house built with donations from people touched by the
family's plight.
   ``I want to thank everybody who gave,'' said Verba Mae Mayo, who
with her husband William have cared for more than 100 foster
children over nearly four decades. ``We've had some wonderful
response from people all over the country.''
   Mrs. Mayo, the 65-year-old pastor of the Mecis Temple Church of
God, and her husband, a retired coal miner in his 70s, were caring
for 11 foster children when the fire destroyed their home July 28.
   All the children escaped harm but the family lost everything
else. Mrs. Mayo said she did not have time to even retrieve her
purse. They were forced to move in with a relative of hers.
   Neighbors organized immediately to build the Mayos another,
bigger house on the lot behind the old one. The new structure is
worth $40,000 but built with only $15,000 because so much of the
labor and material was donated.
   Joe Wood, one of the volunteers who helped direct the building
of the new house, said Tuesday the Mayos hope to move in Friday or
Saturday.
   However, he said the appliances that were donated to the home
were ``just junk'' and that efforts were being made to get nicer
appliances and furnishings.
   ``They've got very little furniture other than almost junk,'' he
said.
   Wood said he was going to Birmingham to seek appliances and
furniture donations and that a church in Leesburg, Va., was
expected to assist with furnishings, but he had no specifics.
   ``She has taken care of lots of people over the years, including
a lot of elderly ... people. And when the kids she kept get too old
for welfare, she sends them on to college if they will go,'' said
Wood, who broke an arm in a fall while putting up sheet rock in the
house.
   Howard Graham, who directed the project with Wood, called Mrs.
Mayo a unique person.
   ``She gives those kids more than just a place to stay. She
really loves those kids and they love her,'' he said.
   ``When their house burned down, I just felt like the Lord put
the burden on me to help my neighbor. But I haven't done it; the
Lord has made this thing work.''
   Mrs. Mayo has been a foster parent for the state for 38 years.
She said she and her husband still hear from most of her one-time
wards.
   ``They still write or call or drop us a card or come by every
now and then,'' she said. ``They still call me Momma and him Daddy.
They're our children.''

   Republican George Bush upgraded his
assessment of his debate with Democrat Michael Dukakis, saying
Tuesday ``maybe we did a little better'' than just a draw.
   Bush, who had tried to play down his forensic skills as he went
into the debate, told reporters on Air Force Two: ``I feel better
today about the way the debate went than I did the night of the
debate.
   ``As I think I told you, I felt it was about even and I now
think maybe we did a little better than that in terms of what we
needed to do. But I can't prove it.''
   Asked why his assessment was so much more modest than that of
other GOP officials, Bush said, ``Well those are what we call the
spin merchants.''
   When a reporter expressed surprise that he was willing to use
that term, Bush replied: ``I've learned to. We've got different
levels of hand wringing in our campaign.
   ``The lowest levels were relieved that I didn't massively foul
it up. It's what we call the relief factor. ...
   ``And I tell you as that worry factor subsided and it was
replaced by what we call the relief factor, you can understand the
rising up of exuberance.
   ``And so there were some proclamations of a `knockout,' `clear
win,' but some of it was the adrenalin rising in that level of
hand-wringers.''
   Asked why he would keep hand-wringers on his staff, he replied:
``Because they need to keep me on the ball. I need their advice. I
welcome their criticism and advice, unlike others. I know I'm not
perfect. This will come as a surprise to you.''

<TEXT>
   Ailing former Teamsters President Roy L.
Williams was released from prison Tuesday after serving nearly
three years for conspiring to bribe a U.S. senator and returned
home to his Missouri farm.
   His parole was granted with the condition that Williams, who has
testified for the government at two organized crime trials,
continue to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. Prosecutors
already have said they want his testimony.
   Williams, 73, who suffers from emphysema and an enlarged heart,
left the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at 1 a.m.,
before the regular hours for processing prisoners, said center
officials. He had been imprisoned there since December 1985.
   ``He didn't want to face a barrage of reporters,'' said
Williams' lawyer, Russell Millin.
   Millin and a friend of Williams drove the former Teamsters
leader to his farm in Leeton, in west-central Missouri, the lawyer
said.
   Williams was not available for interviews after his release, and
a spokesman said he was not likely to submit to interviews for some
time.
   Bruce Houdek, another of Williams' attorney, said Williams was
trying to adjust to life out of prison.
   ``He's basically trying to be at home and relax and wake up
without bars on the windows and people telling him what to do,''
Houdek said.
   The U.S. Parole Commission announced Friday that Williams would
be paroled in recognition of testimony that ``was at great risk to
his personal safety.
   ``This release is contingent upon his continued cooperation with
law enforcement authorities,'' parole commission chairman Benjamin
Baer said in a statement Friday. Baer added that Williams could be
returned to prison if he did not cooperate.
   Houdek said the U.S. attorney's office in New York has requested
Williams' testimony but he did not know when Williams would be
expected to comply.
   Williams was convicted in 1982 of conspiring to bribe then-Sen.
Howard Cannon, D-Nev., to obtain his help in defeating legislation
to deregulate the trucking industry. Cannon was never charged, and
the law passed.
   In an effort to get his 10-year prison sentence reduced,
Williams testified for federal prosecutors in 1985 that reputed
Kansas City crime boss Nick Civella paid him $1,500 a month from
late 1974 to mid-1981.
   Williams said he had agreed to help Civella's organization
secure a multimillion-dollar loan from the Teamsters Central States
Pension Fund.
   In 1987, Williams testified by videotape in a New York
racketeering case, saying Civella had ordered him to run for
international president of the Teamsters.

<TEXT>
   A young man who killed two people and
wounded a third in a shooting spree at a government building last
winter was sentenced Tuesday to the maximum of two consecutive life
terms plus 35\ years in prison.
   Aaron Lindh, 19, of Madison, was sentenced by Dane County
Circuit Court Judge Robert Pekowsky. A two-week trial ended
Saturday when a jury ruled Lindh was sane Jan. 15 when he shot at
people at random in the City-County Building with a .22-caliber
rifle, before he was shot by police.
   ``There is no remorse reflected in this record, no guilt ... no
conscience'' Pekowsky said.
   Lindh was convicted last week of first-degree murder in the
deaths of Coroner Clyde Chamberlain and county corporation counsel
secretary Eleanor Townsend. He also was convicted of attempted
first-degree murder in the shooting of another person.
   Lindh was expressionless throughout the proceeding and simply
replied ``no'' when the judge asked if he had anything to say
before sentencing.
   Lindh's adoptive parents, Mary Anne and John Lindh, and an
unidentified young woman sat in the front row hugging and
periodically crying.
   The courtroom also was filled with relatives and friends of
Townsend and Chamberlain, many in tears.
   ``The ramifications of what happened on the 15th of January will
be felt a long time,'' Pekowsky said. ``It deserves the most severe
sentence I can deal out.''
   The judge imposed mandatory life terms plus five years for the
murders. The additional five years was added because Lindh used a
firearm. The judge also sentenced the defendant to 25 years on the
attempted murder charge and 90 days for carrying a firearm into a
public building.
   The judge ordered that the sentences be served consecutively.
   After the hearing, Lindh's attorney, state public defender
Robert Burke, said he will appeal the conviction.
   Burke contended Lindh's rights were violated when he was
questioned twice in his hospital room hours after the shooting. The
judge ruled the statements admissable.
   Burke also contended he should have been allowed to
cross-examine a key prosecution witness, who said Lindh was not
mentally ill, about a separate case in which the witness may face
charges before the state Medical Examining Board.
   Burke said he wanted to find out if the witness may have
fashioned his testimony to benefit himself in the event charges are
filed in the other case.
   Burke also questioned Lindh's safety in prison.

   Police increased patrols at the high
school and will have all off-duty and reserve officers at the
school's homecoming football game Friday to prevent a flare up in
recent racial tensions, officials said.
   ``We're taking extra precautions,'' said Police Chief Don
Byington.
   A small group of white and black students in recent weeks have
been pushing and shoving each other and shouting racial slurs on
the Clinton High School campus, Byington said. Similar tensions
have arisen in past years in the 71 percent white district, said
Byington and School Superintendent Virgil Belue.
   The disturbances peaked Friday night, when a white Clinton High
student was beaten by ``three or four'' black Clinton High students
at a convenience store, Byington said.
   Belue said administrators and parents have acted to quell the
unrest. On Sunday and Monday, parents met with school and police
officials to talk about ways to stop tension.
   Officials say they're unsure what sparked the tension.
   ``Sometimes it starts over a disagreement,'' Belue said, adding
an incident several years ago started in this town west of Jackson
with students fighting over a parking place. ``Some of these things
aren't necessarily race-related when they start.
   ``But when that difference comes up and a white student is on
one side and a black student on the other, it's identified as a
racial thing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Rashad Shawwa, a Palestinian leader and a
former mayor of Gaza City who was twice deposed by Israel, died
Tuesday of a heart attack, family members said. He was 79.
   Shawwa's nephew, Aown Shawwa, said he suffered from a slight
cold for the past two days and died unexpectedly at 7:15 p.m. at
his Gaza City villa.
   ``Except for the last two days, he still went to the office
every day,'' the nephew said in a telephone interview.
   Thousands of Palestinians from Gaza City gathered at Shawwa's
villa when they learned of his death, Israel television reported.
   Shawwa was born in the Gaza Strip and studied political science
at the American University in Cairo, graduating in 1934.
   He then returned to Gaza and became a civil servant in the
British mandatory administration, reaching the position of governor
of Haifa.
   The British fired him in 1937 because of anti-British activities.
   Israeli military authorities appointed Shawwa mayor of Gaza City
in 1971, four years after Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt
in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Shawwa was twice deposed by the Israelis for nationalistic
activities, once in 1972 and again in 1982.
   Shawwa came from a wealthy and influential family in the Gaza
Strip. In addition to his political activities, he owned an orange
grove and citrus packing house.
   He is survived by his wife, Sarah Khayel, 65, three sons and two
daughters, and seven grandchildren. The funeral is tentatively
scheduled for Thursday.

   Israeli warplanes attacked pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem guerrilla bases in south Lebanon on Tuesday, police
reported, in Israel's 15th air attack on Lebanon this year.
   Police said they were unable to compile a casualty report from
the 10-minute raid by two jet fighters on bases of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in pine woods near the Christian town of Jezzine.
   Hezbollah gunners opened up with anti-aircraft guns as the jets
staged their dive-bombing sorties at 11:30 a.m. on targets about 30
miles south of Beirut. There were no hits, police said.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli command said the target of the strike
was a guerrilla base in a Shiite area near the village of
al-Luwayzah, 10 miles north of the Christian town of Marjayoun.
   Marjayoun is the provincial capital of a border ``security
zone'' Israel carved out in south Lebanon in 1985 to serve as a
buffer against cross-border guerrilla forays.
   Smoke billowed from the stricken bases just outside the zone as
Hezbollah gunmen sealed off the woods west of Jezzine, preventing
police patrols from taking stock of the losses, said a police
spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules.
   Hezbollah is made up of Shiite zealots backed by the Islamic
Republic of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. They have long been waging
guerrilla attacks on Israel's self-proclaimed security zone.
   Jezzine is the northern-most position manned by the
Israeli-sponsored south Lebanon army militia, which patrols the
six-to-10-mile zone.
   The last previous Israeli air raid was on Friday, when jets
raided Palestine Liberation Organization bases near the southern
port city of Sidon, killing three guerrillas and wounding five.
   That brought to 68 people killed and 108 wounded the overall
toll from Israel's 14 air strikes since Jan. 3.

<HEAD>Olympics Increase in Ratings But Still Lag Below Guarantee</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's seven nights of Summer Olympics coverage
made the top seven prime-time shows in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
television ratings last week despite that coverage is receiving
lower-than-anticipated ratings.
   NBC had guaranteed advertisers an average 21.2 rating. Last
week's coverage ranged from 20.1 to 16.8. A 13.9 was recorded for
the half-hour before the presidential debate on Sunday. The
90-minute pre-emption ``seriously affected the overall rating,''
said NBC analyst Jeff Boehme. Otherwise, the Olympics ratings
pretty much rose as the week went on and showed an increase over
the disappointing first three nights.
   If the Olympics rating doesn't live up to the guarantee to
advertisers, NBC has to provide them with free commercial time on
other programs to make up the difference.
   NBC won the week, nevertheless, with its highest weekly rating
in a year, a 19.3 that was also the highest network weekly rating
since a win for ABC during the Winter Olympics. ABC was second with
a 10.7 and CBS third with a 9.8.
   The Olympics were good news and bad news for ``NBC Nightly
News.'' It probably would have been in first place for the first
time since 1987 thanks to the Olympics boost. But it only tied with
ABC for second place _ because of pre-emptions on the West Coast
for live coverage of the Olympics.
   The ``CBS Evening News'' won the week with 10.1 rating and 20
share. ABC ``World News Tonight'' tied NBC with a 9.8. ABC had a 20
share and NBC a 21 share, a result of different time periods that
gave NBC a bigger portion of a smaller audience.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 households with televisions.
The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The week ending Sept. 25 was the first of the official new
television season. However, ABC and CBS are maintaining the season
doesn't really begin until late October, when all three networks
have premiered most of their new fall shows. ABC and CBS are airing
reruns and movies to counter NBC's two weeks of Olympics
programming.
   NBC's Thursday night coverage was the top-rated show of the
week, followed by Saturday, Friday, Sunday, Wednesday, Tuesday and
Monday. CBS followed with its rerun TV movie ``A Stranger Waits,''
and ABC made the top 10 with Tuesday night comedies, ``Head of the
Class'' and ``Growing Pains.''
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Cadets,'' ``Live!
Dick Clark Presents,'' ``The Best of SCTV,'' ``48 Hours,'' ``Beauty
& the Beast,'' ``Garry Shandling Alone in Las Vegas,''
``Bodywatching,'' ``West 57th,'' ``First Impressions'' and
``Frank's Place.''

   President Reagan said farewell Tuesday to
West European and Asian allies with an appeal that they shoulder
more of their joint defense burden.
   His message, summed up at a news conference by Assistant
Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway, was: ``More can be done.''
   But even while praising the president for his commitment to the
North Atlantic alliance, the allies insisted that, for the most
part, they were carrying a fair share.
   The allies stressed their contributions to economic development
in the Third World, Mrs. Ridgway said.
   The 75-minute session, on the periphery of the United Nations
General Assembly meeting, was marked by ``a very positive note of
confidence'' and the notion of ``staying strong was in common
usage,'' Mrs. Ridgway said.
   Reagan met with the leaders of the 15 U.S. allies in NATO and of
Australia, South Korea and Japan as he wound up a two-day visit to
the United Nations, his seventh and last visit to the world body.
   He also held separate sessions with Foreign Ministers Mohammed
Yaqub Khan of Pakistan and Narasimha Rao of India.

<HEAD>Commitment To 50-State Campaign Appears Not Quite Solid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With six weeks to go to election day, aides to
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis are scaling back
expectations across parts of the South and Rocky Mountain West but
express continuing hopes for Texas and a handful of border states.
   The West Coast states are still viewed as prime battlegrounds,
as well, and practically the entire Northeast and Industrial
Midwest are up for grabs in the view of campaign officials.
   But one aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
campaign would soon ``begin pulling back budget and pulling back
staff'' from some states where chances of victory are dim, and
saving them for the more competitive regions.
   Dukakis and his aides have pledged frequently to run a 50-state
campaign this fall.
   ``Watch the schedule'' for clues about which states are regarded
as more winnable, said one adviser, also speaking on condition he
not be identified by name. In his campaigning since the Democratic
National Convention, Dukakis has appeared sparingly in the Deep
South, with the exception of Texas, home state to running mate
Lloyd Bentsen. Dukakis' recent trip to Arkansas and Kentucky were
indications of a continued commitment to several border states in
what shapes up as a close election, officials said.
   Publicly, senior advisers say they will not concede any state to
Bush. ``We are not going to fall into the Republican trap of
cutting off parts of the country,'' said Dukakis' field director
Charlie Baker, who said that the Democrats have assembled a
50-state field organization for the first time in several elections.
   Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas, addressing a meeting of
Southern governors Tuesday at Sea Island, Ga., said, ``We're being
realistic, but we're also campaigning here and will continue to do
so becuase we think we can be successful in the South.''
   Officials hotly dispute that they have reduced efforts in
Florida, with 21 electoral votes, and say they have recently
dispatched new aides to the state. They say that talk of scaling
back is a Republican-inspired ploy to undermine their chances.
   But in contrast to Texas, where the campaign is committed to
running television advertisements specially created for the state,
no similar decision has been made for Florida. And in contrast to
Dukakis' periodic visits to Texas, the Democratic candidate has
been to Florida only once since the Democratic convention in July,
and is not scheduled to return until Oct. 11.
   Dukakis and his advisers have repeatedly pledged their
commitment to a 50-state campaign, and at a meeting of campaign
officials in July, senior adviser Jack Corrigan said he promised
the directors of the 50 statewide oranizizations that Dukakis would
commit the necessary resources in each of them.
   In states such as Virginia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Alabama
in the South and traditional Republican strongholds in the West
such as Wyoming, Idaho and Utah, Arizona, Nevada and Alaska, as
well as Kansas and Nebraska, campaign officials concede privately
they have little chance for success.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's home state
of Indiana is regarded as an extremely difficult state, as is New
Hampshire, according to officials.
   In all, the states involved carry roughly 100 Electoral Votes,
out of 270 needed for victory in the race for the White House. The
states have voted Republican in most recent elections, and Bush
campaign officials have said all year they would give the
Republicans a solid launching pad for their campaign.
   ``We are not at a point yet in our views to completely write off
any states and it is not our plan to do that,'' said Baker, field
director for Dukakis. ``But clearly as this thing tightens up in
terms of last-minute media buy decisions and last minute scheduling
decisions you've got to make some decisions on how you put together
an electoral college majority.''
   Another aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it is
important to keep states competitive in order to keep the
Republicans spending time and resources. ``You see where we are by
looking at the schedule but that doesn't mean we don't keep targets
of opportunity, either,'' the aide said.

<HEAD>Senate Reduces Number Of Businesses Affected In Parental Leave
Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved an amendment
reducing the number of businesses that would have to offer
job-protected leave to workers with medical problems or parental
responsibilities.
   But the ultimate fate of the Family and Medical Leave Act
remained in doubt as the Senate debated the merits of mandating
rather than encouraging employers to offer the benefit. Also
hanging was an amendment to toughen penalties for offenses
involving child pornography and obscenity.
   The bill sponsored by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., would
require employers of 50 or more people to offer at least 10 weeks
of unpaid, job-protected leave to seriously ill employees or those
with newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children.
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said employers should be encouraged
rather than required to respond sensitively to family needs, and
said he would propose a tax incentive amendment with that aim.
   Dodd's initial bill would have exempted only companies of under
20 and required that at least 13 weeks of medical leave be
available.
   Under the revised version, Dodd said, only 5 percent of U.S.
companies would have to comply with the leave requirement. Reducing
the amount of medical leave from 13 to 10 weeks also reduced the
cost, he said, from $190 million to $160 million _ $2.67 per
employee per year.
   ``All this legislation says is that for 10 weeks every two years
if you're confronted with a crisis, you don't lose your job,'' Dodd
said. ``I don't consider that to be an unreasonable idea. I think
it's human decency. I think it's common sense.''
   Conservatives called parental leave a worthy, important benefit
but said it shouldn't be imposed on employers.
   Cochran branded the requirement ``a very drastic departure from
current practice, and it is not really necessary in trying to deal
with the needs of a diverse and changing workforce... We should all
be concerned about the impact it may have on other benefits that
may be available.''
   ``This will continue to make America less competitive,''
contended Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho. ``Nothing is costless in this
society. There's no free lunch.''
   Symms said there was no need for Congress to take up time on the
leave issue at the end of a session, with other important bills
awaiting action. ``I don't believe the people of this country are
in any kind of emergency situation,'' he said.
   ``We didn't get elected to go home,'' Dodd shot back. ``I know
these issues aren't easy. We weren't elected to the U.S. Senate to
make everybody happy. If 51 of my colleagues don't like this idea,
we'll go home.''

<HEAD>Church Official Says Shroud Of Turin Dates To 14th Century</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laboratory tests show the Shroud of Turin was made
in the 14th century and could not be the burial cloth of Christ,
the scientific adviser to the archbishop of Turin said he learned
on Tuesday.
   Professor Luigi Gonella said he has not yet seen the official
report from the three laboratories that conducted the carbon-14
dating tests, but that all the leaks to the press dated it to the
14th century and ``somebody let me understand that the rumors were
right.''
   ``It is quite evident somebody sold out to the press,'' said
Gonella in an interview from his home in Turin.
   He refused to identify who had told him about the results of the
tests at Oxford University, the University of Arizona and the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology at the University of Zurich.
   The shroud _ 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide _
bears the faint, blood-stained image of a whipped and crucified
man. Some have maintained the herringbone patterned linen is the
burial cloth of Christ, while others have dismissed it as a clever
forgery.
   ``We are certainly disappointed in knowing that the shroud has a
medieval date, but this is because it is a cherished object. It's
like having a portrait in your attic that turns out not to be a
picture of your grandfather. But you don't love him less,'' Gonella
was quoted as saying to Britain's domestic news agency, Press
Association.
   The shroud was removed April 21 from the silver chest where it
is kept wrapped in red silk on an altar in the cathedral in Turin.
   A strip _ four-tenths of an inch by 2.8 inches _ was cut from
the cloth and then divided into three smaller pieces for the
laboratories, each of which got one piece, in addition to another
piece of cloth of a known age.
   Gonella said the British Museum, which coordinated the study
with the three laboratories, reportedly sent the test results to
Turin by special courier on Friday. He said he believed Turin's
archbishop, Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, would see the study
when he returned to his office Wednesday after a three-day absence.
   The scientist said it was not the church that demanded secrecy
and denied holding back the results, which he said will be made
public ``quickly'' after Pope John Paul II is informed. However, he
said he could not give a date.
   ``We are very angry. We are being accused of trying to hide the
results, accused of taking part in a conspiracy to hide the truth,
of being afraid of the truth,'' Gonella said.
   ``Now everybody is sure we knew the results when we didn't know
in any credible way,'' he said, adding that it was the three
laboratories and not the church that had asked for secrecy.
   ``They asked for the blind test. They said they would make no
effort to determine which sample came from the shroud. The raw data
was to be sent back to the British Museum where the key to the code
would identify the samples from the shroud. Then they would write
up the scientific result,'' he said.
   The Roman Catholic Church does not claim the shroud as a holy
relic but has treated it with respect because of the possibility it
could have been Christ's burial cloth, Gonella said.
   He said the church always knew it could not prove that the
shroud was the actual burial cloth of Christ, but he bristled at
suggestions that a medieval date for the shroud means it is a fake.
   ``It could be a genuine work of Christian art,'' he said. ``Just
because it is not the burial cloth of Christ does not necessarily
mean it is a forgery or a fake, which implies an intent to
mislead.''
   He said the test results would not entirely resolve the
centuries-old mystery surrounding the cloth, including how it was
made.
   Gonella pointed to the other scientific studies, such as the
1978 Shroud of Turin Project, which could not determine exactly how
the image on the shroud was created.
   French crusader Robert of Clari mentioned seeing the cloth in
1203 in Constantinople at the imperial palace, but the first actual
records trace it only to Lirey in France in 1354.
   The shroud was bequeathed to the pope by former King Umberto II
of Italy, a member of the House of Savoy, upon his death in 1983.

<TEXT>
   The University of Mississippi has banned
all on-campus fraternity-sorority parties because a woman said she
was raped after a similar event off campus, officials said.
   Stover Smith, 18, of Metairie, La., was charged Friday with rape
in the alleged attack after a party off-campus Thursday night, said
Oxford Police Chief Billy White.
   White said the woman left the party with someone shortly after
midnight. She said she was driven to a field three to five minutes
away, then beaten and raped.
   Smith, who has since withdrawn from school, was free on $50,000
bond, White said.
   Judy Trott, assistant dean of students in charge of
fraternities, said the Thursday night ``swaps,'' which bring
together an entire fraternity and an entire sorority, would no
longer be sanctioned by the university.
   Trott said the swaps began as a low-key way for freshmen to meet
but had evolved into full-scale parties, often involving alcohol
and loud music.
   ``I've been concerned about this for years,'' Trott said. ``This
kind of incident capped it off.''
   Thomas J. Reardon, assistant dean of students in charge of
fraternities, said he would investigate the incident, which
followed a party involving Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and Chi
Omega sorority.
   Interfraternity Council President Stuart Brunson said Sigma
Alpha Epsilon was already on social probation because of a rush
infraction and was prohibited from having on-campus parties.
   Trott said that although the party was off campus, it still
reflected on the fraternity-sorority system.
   She said the suspension would be indefinite unless the
organizations ``come up with recommendations down the road that
could convince me they could control the situation.''

   A veteran firefighter appointed the city's first
liaison to the gay and lesbian community said Tuesday he hopes to
use his post to promote tolerance and change homophobic attitudes.
   Fire Inspector Jim Murphy said he also wants to provide support
for other homosexuals in the department and help alleviate tension
between the department and the gay community.
   ``I'll be there to listen,'' Murphy said. ``I'm an openly gay
man and I have been out, so to speak, within the department for 15
months.
   ``Primarily, I hope to address, in one small measure, the issue
of violence within the gay community. ... Homophobia, violence, gay
bashing and all that. That's what I hope to change,'' said Murphy,
41.
   City officials said they hope the job, believed to be the first
of its kind in the country, will improve relations with the gay
community, which reached a low point two years ago when three young
people reported they were violently attacked by off-duty
firefighters shouting anti-gay slurs.
   ``We have an image within the community of being very macho,
sometimes parochial men. It's not wholly true,'' said Murphy, who
has worked for the department for nine years.
   ``A lot of these guys, they have brothers and cousins that are
gay, they just don't discuss it.''
   Fire Commissioner Leo Stapleton agreed immediately to a
suggestion that the new job be created, said Ann Sanders, Mayor
Raymond Flynn's liaison to the gay and lesbian community.

<HEAD>Star Wars General Retiring From Air Force</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, the first and
only director of President Reagan's ``Star Wars'' research program,
has decided to retire from the military next February, the Pentagon
said Tuesday.
   The 55-year-old Abrahamson, a three-star Air Force general who
assumed command of the fledgling Strategic Defense Initiative
Organization in April 1984, will be replaced by Air Force Lt. Gen.
George L. Monahan Jr., said Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief
spokesman.
   Monahan's nomination must be confirmed by the Senate.
   Abrahamson will retire Feb. 1 after 33 years of active military
service, Howard said. The general has not announced any future
plans.
   According to documents released Tuesday by the Pentagon,
including a memo from Abrahamson to Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci, the Star Wars chief decided on his own early this summer
to request retirement.
   Abrahamson said he had concluded the next president should be
allowed to dictate new policies for Star Wars development to a new
leadership team.
   ``I am proud of the people of SDI, who have not indulged
themselves with the negative `it can't be done' approach to
problems,'' Abrahamson wrote.
   ``However, a new administration will undoubtedly have different
ideas or approaches to SDI. Therefore, I reluctantly have concluded
that the program will best be served by allowing new leadership to
represent new policy and direction. As you requested, I will serve
until a successful transition is well under way.''
   The Star Wars program is an effort to develop lasers and other
exotic weapons that could be deployed in space and on the ground to
automatically shoot down Soviet nuclear missiles. Congress
repeatedly has refused in recent years to fund the program at the
pace sought by President Reagan, but nonetheless has allowed the
research to continue.
   Abrahamson, a former astronaut who never got to fly in space, is
credited with putting together a formal organization to oversee the
research work _ which is conducted in laboratories around the world
_ while serving as an effective ``cheer leader'' to Congress and
the business community.
   Even in his retirement memo to Carlucci, Abrahamson couldn't
resist praising the program, saying his Star Wars job had been the
best of his career and had ``allowed me to appreciate the daring
scope of the president's vision and the genius available to the
country to solve this and other daunting challenges.''
   ``I have great confidence that this initiative will go forward
and will succeed. I will continue to dedicate myself to SDI to my
last day of active duty _ and after.''
   Abrahamson, a native of Williston, N.D., is a Vietnam War combat
pilot who trained as an astronaut for the Manned Orbiting
Laboratory Program before it was canceled in 1969.

<HEAD>Senate Report: Pentagon Has Trouble Managing Huge Inventory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite reforms, the Pentagon is still doing a
poor job of managing its inventory of millions of stockpiled items
ranging from aircraft spare parts to food and clothing, a Senate
report said Tuesday.
   The Pentagon should reduce the huge and growing volume of items
it has in its inventory, according to the study by the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee.
   The report was the latest in a series of studies by the
Democratic-controlled panel of how the Pentagon manages its huge
stockpile. The studies have been critical of the Defense Department
and have recommended management changes.
   The studies affect so-called ``secondary items,'' which include
spares, repair parts, supplies, food and clothing. That stockpile
is in contrast to ``principal items'' like tanks, ships, and
airplanes.
   There has been a large increase in the secondary item stockpile,
resulting from President Reagan's defense build-up. The secondary
stockpile, which now contains about 4.6 million different types of
items, is worth $94 billion, compared to its $43 billion value in
1980.
   ``The enormous, unprecedented, and unsustainable growth in the
Pentagon's secondary inventory has simply overwhelmed the
Pentagon's depots, warehouses, and accounting and control
systems,'' the report said.
   The Defense Department's ``supply system has been unable to cope
with the new demands made on it. The management of current
inventories has not kept pace with the Pentagon's ability to spend
money on new goods,'' it said.
   For example, two years ago, the Army Missile Command asked Army
officials in Europe to return 24 Stinger hand-held missiles for
test firing. The Missile Command sought 24 specific missiles, but
service officials in Europe were able to find only nine by March
1987.
   Finally, after searching the Army's entire European inventory of
missiles, service officials were finally able to locate the other
13.
   Army officials conceded that their policy ``for recording
inventory information on small missiles was ambiguous and contained
multiple and contradictory control requirements,'' the study said.
   Pentagon officials, asked for comment, did not immediately
respond.
   However, they agreed with the General Accounting Office last
spring when the congressional watchdog agency raised similar
criticisms of the Pentagon's inventory management. Defense
Department officials conceded they needed to do better.
   The committee recommended a number of changes, including a halt
in the purchase of items not immediately needed and better
administrative and internal Pentagon controls over the vast and
widely segmented inventories.
   One example cited as wasteful spending was the purchase by the
Defense Logistics Agency of metal bars used to mount flashing red
lights atop emergency and police vehicles used by the services.
   Because of an increase in demand, the DLA bought 4,297 of the
bars in February 1986 but shortly after the purchase, the demand
dropped. That means that the DLA now has enough of the bars to last
for the next six years, and stocks of the bars are now clogging the
aisles of a SLA warehouse.
   The panel also said the Pentagon needs to improve security at
sites where weapons and other potentially dangerous items are
stored, a complaint raised in previous hearings.
   For example, the panel said, its investigators found that
Stinger missiles were stored at various sites in West Germany in
lightweight metal sheds with the word ``Stinger'' stenciled on the
shed's side.

<HEAD>Couple Who Defected to Soviet Union Then Returned Home Now Jobless
and Broke</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto ERI1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who sought a better life in the Soviet
Union following financial setbacks in the United States are back
home, saying they are broke, embittered and have been deceived by
U.S. officials.
   Theodore and Cheryle Branch, who returned to the United States
last week after 10 months in the Soviet Union, were staying Tuesday
in a small motel in Erie. They had previously lived in nearby
Summit Township.
   ``By Monday, we will be broke so we are going to move into the
U.S. Courthouse to live,'' said Branch, 42, referring to the
federal courthouse in Erie.
   The Branches said they moved to the Soviet Union because ``we
were so mad at the U.S. government, but not at the people.''
   ``We're really mad now,'' he said.
   The couple claimed that after Soviet officials gave them a
furnished apartment and jobs at Radio Moscow's North American
Service, officials at the U.S. Embassy there offered them the same
benefits plus help resolving their financial troubles if they
returned to the United States.
   However, State Department officials in Washington, D.C., said
the Branches were offered only the same loan available to any
stranded U.S. citizen to finance passage home.
   ``They made promises there, and now they are backing out,''
Branch claimed.
   Branch said that after they arrived in Moscow, the Soviets asked
them to visit the U.S. Embassy because American officials were
worried about them.
   He said they refused because ``we vowed we would never step
inside another federal building. They weren't worried about us
there, why would they be worried about us here?''
   The Soviets asked them in February to assure the U.S. Embassy
that they were not being held against their will. Branch claims
that during a subsequent meeting, Jill Farrelly-Byrnes, the
embassy's second secretary and vice consul, said, ``Do you need
money? We have jobs for you. We have a place for you to live and
medical care.''
   At an August meeting, the embassy officials said they could not
help the Branches solve their problems unless they returned to the
United States, Branch said.
   ``We thought if they were willing to work with us, to make
amends, why should we hold a grudge?'' he said.
   No one greeted them in Washington as promised, Branch said.
   ``I think we have been deceived. We have been stripped of
everything,'' said Mrs. Branch, 40. ``It is hard to believe that in
a democratic society two people could be in such a predicament.''
   The couple want to be reimbursed for the $3,000 airfare and the
motel room.
   ``The government is heavily indebted to us and why shouldn't we
feel like this?'' said Mrs. Branch. ``It is supposed to be a great
democracy.''
   ``We wouldn't be here looking for a job if they hadn't promised
us,'' Branch said.
   He said they might return to the Soviet Union but are ``tired of
moving back and forth across the ocean at somebody's whim.''
   The troubles that made the Soviet Union look good included the
couple's inability to collect $10,000 in back wages from Central
Florida Broadcasting Co. despite a federal court judgment in their
favor.
   Land they owned in Erie County was declared part of a flood
plain by the federal government and is worthless, Mrs. Branch said.

   A flight attendant testifying at
the murder and air piracy trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi said Tuesday
that Hamadi's accomplice killed a U.S. Navy diver aboard a hijacked
TWA airliner.
   The attendant, Hazel Hesp, said hijacker Hassan Ezzeddine killed
diver Robert Stethem after the TWA jet was commandeered June 14,
1985.
   The testimony contradicted that of John Testrake, the plane's
pilot, who told the court he believed Hamadi was the hijacker who
killed Stethem.
   Ms. Hesp also testified that Ezzeddine claimed a friend of his
had carried out the bombing mission that killed 241 U.S. servicemen
in Beirut in 1983.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has admitted hijacking the TWA
jetliner on the Athens-to-Rome flight and holding 39 Americans
hostage for 17 days. But said the other hijacker killed Stethem, of
Waldorf, Md.
   Ms. Hesp said Ezzeddine, who is at large, ``seemed to be giving
the orders'' during the hijacking.
   The 47-year-old Ms. Hesp said ``Said'' was the name Ezzeddine
used during the hijacking. Hamadi, she said, called himself
``Castro.''
   Ms. Hesp did not name her home or nationality, under guidelines
set by the court to protect witnesses in the trial, some of whom
have said they feared reprisals. Her speech had a British accent.
   Outside the courtroom at Preungesheim prison, security remained
tight as it has been since the trial began July 5. There were about
two dozen policemen near the entrance, and at least three carried
machine guns.
   Asked by the court judge if she knew who killed the 23-year-old
Stethem, Ms. Hesp paused, then said: ``Yes. But I did not see the
shot, so it is only my opinion. It would be my opinion that it
would be Said who shot.''
   She added: ``They were both terrifying, of course, but of the
two men it is my feeling that Said was the more vicious.''
   ``I remember when we first took off from Athens and they punched
our heads down and they were running up and down screaming,'' Ms.
Hesp said. ``I remember I was always more afraid when I saw the
white shoes, because I knew they belonged to Said.''
   Other witnesses, including flight engineer Benjamin Zimmermann,
have testified Ezzeddine was the more violent of the two hijackers,
but that both seemed to have equal authority.
   When asked to comment, Hamadi, who sat quietly through much of
the testimony with his elbow propped on the table and chin in his
left palm, told the court in Arabic through his translator he had
nothing to say.
   Throughout the trial, the court has given Hamadi the opportunity
to comment without having to take the witness stand.
   Ms. Hesp said Ezzeddine could speak a litte English and told her
a friend of his drove a truck laden with explosives into the U.S.
Marine compound in Beirut in 1983, blowing up the barracks and
killing 241 U.S. servicemen.
   ``He seemed to be very proud of this and told of how he hates
Americans, and wondered how non-Americans could work for an
American airline,'' said Ms. Hesp.
   Across the courtroom, facing Hamadi, Patricia and Richard
Stethem, the parents of the slain Navy diver, took notes and
listened quietly.
   In other testimony Tuesday, another flight attendant, Jody Cox,
47, described how she and others on the flight were forced to sit
for hours with their heads between their knees and hands on the
back of their heads.
   Speaking in an unsteady voice, Ms. Cox, an American, said she
heard the screams of hostages being beaten by the hijackers.
   ``I saw Clinton Suggs with his hands bound, and Stethem too.
They had cloths tied around their heads as blindfolds,'' Ms. Cox
said.
   Suggs testified Monday he thought he would die next when one of
the hijackers said after Stethem was shot, ``One more in five
minutes.''
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after
customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage. In
the following week, two West Germans were kidnapped in Beirut. Both
men have been freed.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas Hamadi, was convicted by a Duesseldorf
court of taking part in the kidnappings in a failed effort to
pressure West Germany into releasing Mohammed.

<HEAD>GAO Says Export Promotion Programs In `State Of Disorder'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Rep. Doug Barnard charged Tuesday that
export promotion programs run by the Department of Commerce are
doing more to confuse American businesses seeking to market their
products abroad than to help them.
   Barnard, a Democrat who heads the House government operations
subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs, said a
General Accounting Office study requested by the subcommittee
concluded that the department's management of trade shows and trade
missions abroad is in ``a state of disorder.''
   ``Instead of helping American businesses to get into the export
business, it seems that the Commerce Department is doing more to
confuse and frustrate anyone who thinks about selling abroad,''
Barnard said. ``This situation must be remedied without delay.''
   A draft copy of the GAO report, released by the subcommittee,
said about 55 percent of the major trade events scheduled abroad by
the department's International Trade Administration in 1987 were
canceled.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the frequent
cancellation of advertised trade shows or missions ``has limited
the credibility of the program in the U.S. business community and
in some overseas locations.''
   Desiree Tucker, a spokeswoman for the ITA, said the agency has
reviewed the GAO report and is preparing a written response.
   Major responsibility for export promotion programs abroad lies
with the ITA's U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, which has 155
commercial officers in 66 countries. The agency, which also has
offices in 48 states, had a $68.9 million budget in fiscal 1987,
with $39.2 million for foreign operations.
   Two other ITA divisions share the responsibility for export
promotion programs, the GAO said, and a lack of coordination among
the three units has resulted in poor planning and execution of
trade events and a lack of accountability.
   The GAO also criticized the U.S. and Foreign Commerical Service
for failing in three attempts since 1978 to develop a computerized
trade information data base that would provide up-to-date
international marketing and trade information to government and
business officials.
   A ``very limited'' version of the data base is supposed to be
operational by tne end of the year, the GAO said. Full
implementation is expected to cost $39.9 million through 1993, not
including the $13.4 million spent on the two previous attempts to
computerize the trade data.

<HEAD>U.S. Seeks to Keep Nuclear Arms Out of Troop Reduction Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, in a move
bound to reassure France, said Tuesday that East-West troop
reduction talks would not be expanded to cover nuclear weapons.
   But it still was not clear when the negotiations might begin
despite President Reagan's statement that they would open soon and
discussions this week at the United Nations.
   The negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Warsaw Pact are intended to reduce non-nuclear forces,
tanks and other mobile weapons in Europe.
   French President Francois Mitterrand and Defense Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement, during talks Thursday in Washington with
Reagan and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, are expected to reject
any Soviet attempt to use the forum to promote nuclear weapons
reductions.
   France agreed to the negotiations only with reluctance. The
French are determined to protect their independent nuclear force
from cutbacks under joint U.S.-Soviet pressure. In fact, France is
planning to deploy a new tactical missile system.
   Shultz, at a news conference here, said flatly: ``The talks will
not be expanded to include nuclear weapons. They are confined to
conventional weaons.''
   The start of negotiations has been delayed by a dispute over
human rights. The United States has sought assurances from the
Soviet Union that there would be a simultaneous improvement in
human rights conditions in Eastern Europe.
   The issue was discussed at meetings that Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze had in Washington last week with Reagan and
Shultz.
   U.S. officials said afterward that the Spviets had promised to
release 27 political prisoners and to reform their emigration
regulations.
   Reagan, in a speech Monday to the U.N. General Assembly, said
the East-West talks would open soon.
   Both Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky and
British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, in separate meetings
Tuesday with reporters, said the chances were good the talks would
be held this year.
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne L. Ridgway said, however,
Shevardnadze's visit to Washington ``certainly did not erase all of
the differences.''
   She said U.S. officials reviewed the situation this week with
West European allies attending the U.N. session.
   ``I think there's a sense here that the last issues have been
defined,'' she said. ``But there is nothing that has been done here
to specifically _ on a case-by-case basis _ to change the
situation.''

   A teacher who was wounded while trying to
stop a gunman during a fatal shooting spree in an elementary
school, and then held the man for police, ``thinks about others
before herself,'' colleagues said.
   An 8-year-old was killed and two teachers and eight students
were wounded in Monday's attack at Oakland Elementary School.
   ``He seemed to be shooting people who were screaming,'' said
School Superintendent Robert S. Watson. ``The teacher said those
who were screaming or making noise, he shot them.''
   City Recorder Ted Windham denied bond Tuesday for James William
Wilson, and retired state Supreme Court Justice Bruce Littlejohn,
acting as a special judge, ordered Wilson to undergo psychiatric
examination.
   Relatives said Wilson, 19, had been in and out of a hospital
psychiatric ward.
   Police Chief James Coursey said Tuesday that Wilson was charged
with murder and other charges were being drawn up to be served
after the psychological evaluation. Solicitor Townes Jones said his
office will consider pursuing the death penalty.
   A 7-year-old who was shot in the neck was returned to surgery
Tuesday because of complications and was in critical condition.
   Coursey said Wilson walked through the school's front door
Monday morning, went to the cafeteria and opened fire with a
.22-caliber, nine-shot revolver, wounding one teacher and three
students.
   He left the cafeteria and entered a girl's restroom to reload.
   Physical education teacher Kat Finkbeiner followed and tried to
prevent him from leaving the room, Coursey said, but when they
scuffled Ms. Finkbeiner was shot in the hand and mouth.
   Wilson got by Ms. Finkbeiner and opened fire in a classroom,
wounding five students and killing Shequila Tawonn Bradley, Coursey
said.
   After emptying his pistol, Wilson dropped it. Ms. Finkbeiner
told him to raise his hands and made him stay in place until a
police officer arrived, the chief said.
   Those who know Ms. Finkbeiner said her action came as no
surprise, said Gay McHugh, principal at Lakeview Elementary School,
where Ms. Finkbeiner also teaches.
   When she heard a physical education teacher had helped stop the
gunman, ``I knew immediately it had to be her. She is always
willing to go that extra mile,'' Ms. McHugh said.
   Penny Dean, who used to teach at Oakland, said Ms. Finkbeiner
``thinks about others before herself.''
   Ms. Dean said Ms. Finkbeiner ``really cares about people.
Everything she does she does with gusto.''
   Ms. Finkbeiner was in fair condition Tuesday at Self Memorial
Hospital and has not yet talked with police, said spokesman Dan
Branyon. A second teacher was in good condition.
   Superintendent Watson said he knew of no connection between the
gunman and the school.
   ``I don't know if we'll ever have a motive,'' Coursey said.
   Wilson's father, James Wilson, said his son is a hyperactive
recluse who had been admitted to Self Memorial's psychiatric ward
three or four times in the past eight months.
   He and the young man's paternal grandmother, Gladys Wilson, said
the young man had not returned more recently because the family's
medical insurance ran out.
   Lately, Wilson had begun reading about mass murderers and talked
about the crimes in the books on the day of the shooting, said Mrs.
Wilson, with whom the younger Wilson had lived the past two years.
He tended to become violent, especially when he was on medication,
she said.
   The school in this city of about 20,000 people in South
Carolina's textile belt about 75 miles northwest of Columbia
remained closed Tuesday but planned to reopen Wednesday. The
district planned counseling for teachers and students.
   One student, 7-year-old Tequila Thomas, was in critical
condition Tuesday after three to four hours of surgery Monday for
neck wounds. Branyon said Tequila was returned to surgery Tuesday
because of unspecified complications and remained in critical
condition afterward.
   Six students were treated for superficial gunshot wounds and
released Monday, Branyon said. A seventh was released Tuesday.

<HEAD>American Book Exhibit Opens In Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of Soviet readers got a tantalizing look
Tuesday at American books that most of them still cannot buy.
   The exhibit of several thousand volumes is the latest foreign
joint venture to offer Western products for the foreign currency
that few are permitted to hold. Soviets can order the books by mail
from publishers.
   Soviets browsed among books such as an atlas with more detailed
and accurate maps of their own country than those published by
Soviet map makers; a handbook on future NASA missions; fiction by
once-banned native authors and a book by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Despite the currency limitations and the exhibit's obscure
location _ behind two gates and in a corner of an international
exhibition hall _ the American organizers were grateful.
   ``It ain't Gorky Street,'' a popular Moscow shopping area,
acknowledged Martin Levin of the firm Cowan, Liebowitz and Latham
of New York.
   But Gorky Street is next on Levin's agenda. He hopes a store
that accepts Soviet rubles will open within a year.
   Levin defended the current, hard-to-find site because ``having
the (Soviet) public come in is counterproductive'' as long as they
lack the right money to spend.
   Only the few Soviets with hard currency legally obtained through
such means as a trip abroad, and retained in a Soviet bank account,
will be able to order books from the exhibit, said Dmitry Mamleev,
deputy chairman of the State Committee on Publishing, Printing and
Book Trade.
   The yearlong exhibit will cater to Soviet libraries and Soviet
businesses with hard currency such as dollars. U.S. publishers
chose to send largely scientific and technical works sought by
Soviet institutional customers.
   American fiction was nearly non-existent. The handful of volumes
included Alex Haley's ``Roots,'' and Tom Wolfe's ``The Right
Stuff'' and ``Bonfire of the Vanities.''
   The books can be ordered for the regular U.S. price plus 10
percent, but most customers will have to wait as long as four
months for delivery, according to the Soviet government's
distributor, the International Books agency.
   Alexander Belostotsky, deputy director of International Books,
gave assurances that any book ordered through his agency will reach
its buyer, despite a Soviet history of prohibiting individual
importation of most foreign publications.
   Other joint ventures in the Soviet Unio with goods available
only for foreign currency include Baskin-Robbins ice cream and
British beer.

<HEAD>Nancy Caught In Traffic, Holds Up Reagan's Motorcade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The heavy traffic in the heart of New York City,
can be unforgiving, even for the president of the United States and
his wife.
   President Reagan's departure from The Waldorf-Astoria hotel was
delayed for about 20-30 minutes Tuesday when his wife, Nancy, was
held up in traffic returning from another part of Manhattan.
   Reagan's long motorcade was wrapped around the hotel at the
corner of 50th Street and Lexington Avenue. While frustrated New
York motorists leaned on their horns, the president's party held
fast while they awaited the first lady.
   That didn't put a damper on things, however, for the thousands
of New Yorkers who poured out onto the streets in the early
afternoon sun to witness the presidential party's motorcade as it
wended its way through streets totally cleared for its passage to a
heliport in Manhattan.
   Mrs. Reagan seemed to go out of her way to assure reporters that
the delay was unavoidable. ``I got stuck in traffic,'' she said as
she joined the president in boarding Air Force One at Newark
International Airport for the return trip to Washington.
   Once on the ground at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban
Maryland, Mrs. Reagan walked toward reporters briefly and said
again that she had been held up in traffic.
   Asked if she had been shopping in New York City, Mrs. Reagan
shook her head and said, ``Lunch.''
   Asked whether the president had gotten angry over the delay, she
smiled broadly, looked in his direction, and said, ``No.''
   Reagan conducted two days of talks with a host of foreign
leaders and addressed the United Nations' General Assembly.

   It's hard finding a good baby sitter these
days, especially when the baby in question is a chimp.
   A few weeks ago Joyce Wriston lost her regular sitter for
38-pound Herbie, so she took out newspaper ads seeking a new one.
   More than 75 people responded, but Wriston said choosing the
right sitter was harder than it sounds. Herbie was in on the
selection process.
   ``He ... ushered one (prospect) right out the front door,'' she
said. ``It was a woman who I thought would be really good with him,
but he just didn't accept her. Herbie walked her to the door and
gave her a little push as she went out.''
   Wriston finally picked Indy Snyder, of Soak Creek, who said she
answered the ad because she loves animals.
   Snyder said her introduction to Herbie was a bit unsettling. ``I
had never seen a chimp in my life. I can't explain how I felt when
I saw him come romping through the hallway,'' she said.
   ``We've had to spend some time getting to know each other. It's
easier for him to get to know you than the other way around. He
seems to know exactly what you say to him.''
   Herbie's not your average chimp, of course. He wears clothes and
shoes, eats at the table, watches TV and plays with toys. He also
showers, dresses himself and brushes his teeth. He has developed
his own brand of sign language for communicating.
   Snyder's responsibilities include preparing Herbie's food and
seeing that he follows basic house rules.
   ``Being with Herbie is more confining than caring for a child,''
she said. ``You can't send him out in the yard to play by himself.
You have to be right with him all the time.''

   Health guru Richard Simmons and 25
aerobics instructors will teach Soviets how to take off the pounds
that borsch and blintzes have put on.
   Simmons and the instructors are making the Oct. 5 trip in
response to a Soviet request to show its inhabitants how to keep
fit.
   ``I think that this is a good, friendly gesture on the Russians'
part,'' said Priscilla Pope, one of three Charleston instructors
chosen for the 11-day trip, which will also include Chinese and
Australian instructors. ``Maybe we can be friendlier and do more
things like this in the future.''
   ABC will film the trip, whose highlight will be a massive
aerobics demonstration in Moscow's Gorky Park, for a television
special.
   ``I'm not really nervous,'' Pope said. ``But I wonder what their
aerobics will be like. Their teachers are so advanced aerobically.
   ``But I can't imagine the average Russian citizen belonging to a
health club.''

<HEAD>Agency Says Aquaculture Production Is Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aquaculture production in the United States,
which includes fish farming, has grown by 20 percent a year since
1980, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Production includes food and non-food fish, shellfish and
aquatic plants, the department's economic research unit said.
   ``Domestic production of food fish and shellfish amounted to an
estimated 700million pounds in 1987 and was worth almost $550
million at the farm gate, compared with 203 million pounds and $191
million in 1980,'' the agency said. ``Last year, non-food
aquacultural production included, among other items, $71.5 million
of baitfish and $23 million of tropical fish.''
   The report by the USDA agency was the first in six years. When
aquaculture began to move up as an agricultural enterprise, reports
were issued in 1980, 1981 and 1982. They were dropped after that as
an economy measure.
   ``During the 1980s, Americans have substantially increased the
quantity of fish and shellfish in their diets despite the fact that
seafood prices have risen considerably faster than those for some
major competing sources of dietary protein,'' the report said.
   Per capita consumption of all fishery products rose 18 percent
to 20.2 pounds in 1987 from an estimated 17.1 pounds in 1980.
   The largest sources of U.S. fishery products are domestic wild
harvests and imports, the report said. Commercial fishermen landed
a record 11 billion pounds of fish and shellfish last year, with a
wholesale value of $3.6 billion, an increase of 1.8 billion pounds
and $500 million from 1986.
   Imports were valued at a record $8.8 billion in 1987, led by
$1.7 billion worth of fresh and frozen shrimp. Lobster and tuna
were next at $600 million and $500 million, respectively.

<HEAD>Bill Would Appoint Panel To Investigate S&L Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee
said Tuesday he will introduce legislation to create a 14-member
panel to study the savings and loan crisis and make recommendations
to the next president and Congress early next year.
   The bill, to be sponsored by Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,
is similar to legislation that passed the Senate on Friday.
   The effort to create study commissions comes as debate is
intensifying over the need for a taxpayer bailout of the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Federal S&L regulators say $31
billion is required to rescue the industry. However, the General
Accounting Office, Congress' auditing wing, and others say $50
billion or more _ with at least some of it coming from taxpayers _
will be needed.
   In July, the House Banking Committee rejected another measure to
create a study commission, sponsored by Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va. St
Germain had objected, saying that Republicans would be too heavily
represented on Parris' commission.
   The 14-member St Germain commission would have six members
appointed by Democratic leaders in Congress, four by Republican
leaders and two by the Reagan administration. The next president
would appoint the remaining two.
   A St Germain aide said the legislation would likely be
introduced and acted on by the committee before the end of the week.
   The Senat bill, sponsored by Sens. James Sasser, D-Tenn., and
Bob Graham, D-Fla., would create a 12-member panel required to
report to Congress by Feb. 1. In addition to studying the S&L
crisis, the Senate committee would examine the deposit insurance
system for commercial banks.
   Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, as a step
toward developing an administration recommendation for solving the
S&L problem, has ordered Undersecretary George D. Gould to evaluate
the conflicting estimates of the cost of bailing out the industry.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill, an
unabashed liberal, awkwardly came to the aid of Michael Dukakis on
Tuesday following weeks of Republican efforts to paint the
Democratic presidential nominee as a liberal.
   Republican candidate George Bush, President Reagan and others
have repeatedly called Dukakis a liberal ``out of the mainstream''
of American politics.
   ``I'm an old-fashioned liberal,'' O'Neill said in drawing a
contrast between himself and Dukakis. ``He's a progressive, he's a
technician, he's a leader.''
   At a news conference, O'Neill also chided Bush for forgetting
his roots in Massachusetts and ``slurring'' Boston in recent
remarks. Bush was born in suburban Milton, Mass.
   In the presidential debate Sunday night, Bush noted that Dukakis
called one Reagan administration program ``phony'' and added
sarcastically, ``or one of those other marvelous Boston
adjectives.''
   ``I certainly am resentful of the slurring manner he talked
about Boston _ as though we weren't Americans and didn't love our
flag and our country,'' O'Neill said.
   When asked for a response, Mark Goodin, a Bush campaign
spokesman in Washington, said, ``I think Tip should have stuck to
American Express ads. He's much more believable in that role,
rather than on the stump trying to convince people Mike Dukakis
isn't just as liberal as he is.''

<TEXT>
   A Methodist minister was taken
from his home early Tuesday and detained by police who claimed he
violated a ban on calls for an election boycott, the clergyman's
wife reported.
   Church colleagues confirmed that the Rev. Tom Mbabane's
detention as the Methodist and Roman Catholic churches released the
text of pastoral letters urging their followers to consider
refusing to vote in nationwide municipal elections on Oct. 26.
   Also on Tuesday, a bomb exploded outside a police station in
Cape Town, damaging a door and breaking windows but causing no
injuries, police said.
   Most of the more than 50 bombings in South Africa this year have
been blamed on the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement. The government says the ANC intends to step up its
bombing and sabotage campaign in the weeks leading to the elections.
   Agnes Mbabane said officers who took her 55-year-old husband
from his home at about 12:45 a.m. Tuesday in the black township of
Soweto alleged that the minister had preached against participation
in next month's elections.
   She said her husband had not advocated an election boycott but
had conveyed the Methodist Church's appeal to its congregations to
consider carefully whether they should vote.
   Methodist leaders sent out a pastoral letter saying abstention
from voting would be the only way for some voters to convey their
rejection of apartheid. The letter said, ``Only candidates who are
openly and sincerely committed to the complete abolition of
apartheid are worthy of Christian support.''
   The Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference issued a
similar letter.
   Mbabane is a regional vice chairman of the Methodist Church. The
chairman of his district, the Rev. Peter Storey, said in a
statement: ``The authorites must have taken leave of their senses
to remove someone of Mr. Mbabane's stature and integrity from
Soweto at this tense time.''
   Oct. 26 will be the first time South Africans of all races go to
the polls the same day. Anti-apartheid activists generally oppose
taking part in segregated local elections while the black majority
is excluded from full participation in national elections.
   A state-of-emergency regulation bans calls for an election
boycott, but Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and many other
activist clergymen defied the ban.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which
South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.
The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.

   President Reagan has nominated five generals
and admirals for promotions and announced the retirements of three
others, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Lt. Gen. Craven C. Rogers Jr. of the Air Force has been selected
as the next deputy chief of the U.S. Central Command, the Pentagon
said. That is the military organization responsible for U.S. forces
in the Middle East.
   Rogers, 54, is a native of Galveston, Texas, who is currently
serving as the commander of the 7th Air Force in South Korea.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas A. Baker, meanwhile, has been
nominated for promotion to the rank of lieutenant general and
ordered to replace Rogers in South Korea. Baker, 53, is a native of
Galconda, Ill., who is currently serving as the vice commander of
the Air Training Command.
   The president also has nominated Navy Rear Adm. James F. Dorsey
Jr. for a promotion to the rank of vice admiral and a new
assignment as commander of the U.S. 3rd Fleet in Hawaii. Dorsey,
54, is a native of Baltimore, Md., who is currently serving as the
assistant deputy chief of naval operations for plans, policy and
operations.
   Rear Adm. Henry H. Mauz Jr. has been nominated for promotion to
the rank of vice admiral and assignment as the next commander of
the U.S. 7th Fleet in Japan. Mauz, 52, is a native of Lynchburg,
Va., who is currently serving as the deputy chief of staff for
plans and operations with the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
   The fifth promotion involves Rear Adm. John E. Gordon, who was
nominated to receive a second star and to move to the position of
deputy judge advocate general of the Navy. Gordon, 47, is a native
of Kingston, Pa., and is currently serving as the head of the Naval
Security and Investigative Command.
   Each of the promotions will require Senate confirmation.
   The three retirements all involve naval officers. They include
Vice Adm. Clyde R. Bell, Vice Adm. Walter T. Piotti Jr. and Vice
Adm. William E. Ramsey, the Pentagon said.
   Bell will step down on Dec. 1 after completing more than 35
years of active-duty service. He is currently serving as the vice
director of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff.
   Piotti is retiring on Jan. 1, 1989, after completing more than
32 years of active service. He is now the head of the Military
Sealift Command.
   Ramsey is planning to retire on March 1, 1989, after completing
more than 35 years of active service. He is currently the deputy
commander of the U.S. Space Command.

<TEXT>
   USA Today on Tuesday outlined its plan of
succession for the retirement of editor John C. Quinn in 1990 and
placed Peter Prichard, 43, in line to become the daily's next chief.
   John J. Curley, president of Gannett Co., Inc., USA Today's
parent company, said Quinn will move from editor to editor-in-chief
on Oct. 1. Prichard, a senior editor at USA Today, will succeed
Quinn as editor.
   In another key promotion, Curley announced the appointment of
Nancy J. Woodhull as president of Gannett News Services, a unit
that includes the Gannett News Service, a supplemental wire
service, and Gannett New Media, a research and development unit of
Gannett.
   Woodhull, 43, succeeds Quinn as president of the wire service.
   Curley said Ronald D. Martin will continue as executive editor
and vice president of USA Today. Martin has been executive editor
of the newspaper since its inception in 1982.
   Martin, 50, also was appointed to the newspaper's management
committee with responsibility for the daily direction of the
newspaper's news staff and coverage, including its cooperation with
``USA Today: The Television Show.'' He also becomes executive
editor of USA Weekend.
   Charles L. Overby, another of the top four Gannett news
executives, continues as vice president@news of the parent company.
Overby, 42, will focus his attention on the newspaper division,
working with editors of Gannett's 88 other daily newspapers,
according to Curley.
   Quinn, who will be 63 next month, will continue as Gannett's
executive vice president-news while turning over his titles as
editor of USA Today and chief of the Gannett News Service. He also
continues as a director of Gannett Co., Inc. and a member of the
Gannett and USA Today management committees.
   Prichard began his journalism career in 1970 at The Greenwich
(Conn.) Time. He joined Gannett in 1972 as a reporter at the
Rochester Democrat & Chronicle. He worked at WOKR-TV in Rochester,
N.Y., in 1975 and returned to the Rochester Times-Union in 1976.
Later, he worked on the corporate staff of Gannett before joining
USA Today in 1982.
   He is the author of ``The Making of McPaper: The Inside Story of
USA Today.''

<HEAD>Air Force Docking Thiokol On MX Payments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force, dissatisfied with the pace of
safety improvements after a disastrous fire at a Morton Thiokol
Inc. plant, has begun docking the company a portion of contract
payments for work on the MX missile, the service and company said
Tuesday.
   The company was notified on Aug. 30 that 15 percent of each
month's payment would be withheld, said Capt. Kathi Blevins, a
spokeswoman for the Air Force Systems Command.
   On Sept. 6, the first penalty was applied, and the Air Force is
now withholding $767,208 from the firm, the spokeswoman said.
   ``We took this action because of Thiokol's lack of compliance
with contract requirements in that the company has failed to ensure
that its employees follow operating procedures, and that there has
been a general deterioriation of the housekeeping practices related
to safety,'' she added in a prepared statement.
   Morton Thiokol holds two Air Force contracts calling for
production of first-stage rocket motors for the huge MX _ or
Peacekeeper _ nuclear ballistic missile. One contract was awarded
in fiscal 1985 and totals $93.5 million, and the second was awarded
the following year and totals $144.3 million.
   Morton's manufacturing plant, 25 miles west of Brigham City,
Utah, was shaken by an explosion and fire on Dec. 29, 1987, that
left five workers dead. The men were working in a special building
known as a casting pit, where solid rocket fuel is poured and set
inside the rocket engine's cylinder.
   The company was fined last March by the state of Utah for safety
violations in connection with the accident. A 1986 audit performed
by the Air Force, obtained after the accident, complained of
``marginal'' industrial safety and fire protection procedures at
the plant.
   The Air Force declined Tuesday to spell out in detail why it was
now penalizing the company by withholding contract payments,
suggesting only that the firm had failed to meet the requirements
of an ``action plan'' it put together to ensure safe operations
after the fire.
   The Air Force's prepared statement referred to ``deficiencies''
in ``operating procedures.''
   ``Measurable improvements in safety and housekeeping procedural
compliance must be accomplished before reinstatement occurs,'' the
statement said.
   ``There is not a set date for compliance. The length of time
necessary to resolve deficiencies ... is dependent on Thiokol's
ability to effectively ensure employee compliance with operating
procedures.''
   Rocky Raab, a Thiokol spokesman, agreed Tuesday the company had
been informed contract payments were being withheld but said he
could not discuss details of what prompted the move.
   ``We're working very closely with them and we expect to get back
in compliance with the contract before very long, but it has been a
difficult process,'' Raab said.
   The spokesman said he could not predict when the company would
satisfy the Air Force's concerns.

   ``Both rates will be adjusted to reflect the processing location

<TEXT>
   In the aftermath of a dispute with three
subordinates, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Tuesday spelled
out requirements governing contacts by Justice Department officials
with members of Congress.
   In a memo to department officials, Thornburgh directed that all
department personnel ``observe operating procedures'' to be sent
``from time to time'' by the Office of Legislative Affairs, headed
by Assistant Attorney General Tom Boyd. Thornburgh also asked that
department employees ``carefully follow'' the office's legislative
guidance.
   ``If we are to fulfill the duties and obligations of the
Department, it is essential that we speak with one voice to
Congress,'' Thornburgh said in the memo, which was distributed to
reporters.
   ``There has been and should contiue to be vigorous internal
debate over legislative policy,'' said Thornburgh. ``However, once
policy decisions have been made, we should work together using all
of our resources.''
   The request comes a week after three agency heads went to
Capitol Hill and opposed a legislative compromise Thornburgh had
worked on to create an inspector general to investigate some
components of the Justice Department.
   In what department sources subsequently described as an angry
meeting, Thornburgh bluntly told the three to drop their opposition
to the compromise.
   The three agency heads who spoke against the compromise to Sen.
John Glenn, D-Ohio, were Stanley Morris, director of the Marshals
Service; Alan Nelson, head of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service; and Michael Quinlan, director of the Bureau of Prisons.
Their agencies would be stripped of current internal inspection and
audit powers under the legislation.
   Thornburgh had reluctantly endorsed the compromise, saying the
alternative would be a more drastic approach placing the entire
department under the scope of an inspector general's investigative
and audit authority.
   Currently, the department's Office of Professional
Responsibility investigates allegations of wrongdoing within the
department.

   Soybean price support loan rates for the 1988
crop will be $4.77 per bushel, unchanged from last year, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   That was also unchanged from the preliminary support rate
announced Aug. 12. All soybean producers will be eligible for the
loan program, officials said.
   Soybean market prices are currently around $8 per bushel, far
above the loan rate _ the amount farmers can borrow from the
government by using their crop as collateral.
   Prices rose as a result of smaller supplies this year. The
harvest, reduced by drought, is estimated at about 1.47 billion
bushels, down 23 percent from 1987 production.

   The head of the Justice Department's
anti-pornography unit is on administrative leave and under
investigation for allegedly asking a department lawyer to destroy a
document in a pending case, department sources said Tuesday.
   Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General H. Robert Showers asked
the lawyer this month to destroy the document, according to sources
who discussed the matter on condition they not be identified.
   As a result of the allegations, Showers, who was brought into
the Justice Department by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
is now the subject of an investigation by the Office of
Professional Responsibility, the sources said.
   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller would not comment.
   The pending case involves Avram Freedberg, a Stamford, Conn.,
man who owns a mail-order business promoting sexually explicit
materials, the sources said.
   Freedberg is under indictment in Utah for using the mails to
send out allegedly obscene advertising brochures, magazines and
videocassettes.
   His attorney, David Kendall of Washington, filed a motion to
dismiss the indictment last week in U.S. District Court in Salt
Lake City, Utah.
   Freedberg's motion maintains that the indictment is tainted
because the entire foundation of the prosecution is based on
information which Freedberg was required under federal criminal law
to supply to the Postal Service.
   The information consists of envelopes sent by Freedberg's
company containing allegedly obscene material which are marked
``sexually oriented advertisements.''
   In regard to data supplied under the self-reporting requirement,
Freedberg is entitled under the Fifth Amendment to immunity from
prosecution, Kendall's motion said.
   In addition to the criminal matter, Freedberg's lawyers also
filed a civil suit in federal court in Washington in May against
Showers and other Justice Department employees, alleging that the
department was threatening to bring prosecutions against them in
four jurisdictions.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson temporarily enjoined
the department in June from proceeding in more than one district.
The Utah indictment was then filed.

Portland, citing health reasons.
   The announcement by the 68-year-old Bangor native came as a
surprise.
   O'Leary, who has served for 14 years as spiritual leader of
Maine's 278,000 Catholics, will continue to administer the
statewide diocese until Pope John Paul II names a successor.
   Meeting with reporters at the Catholic Chancery, O'Leary did not
elaborate on his medical condition but acknowledged a history of
blood pressure problems and said he has been on a low-salt,
low-cholesterol diet for some time.
   ``It's just the general aging process, I guess, that's caught up
with me,'' he said, adding that he consulted with medical advisers
and concluded that he was no longer able to sustain the schedule,
responsibilities and expectations of his post.
   ``People tell me now that I've never looked better. Perhaps it's
because I made the decision (to retire) that accounts for the
healthful look,'' he said.
   O'Leary declined to speculate on his successor, citing the
confidentiality of the process. It normally takes three to six
months for the pope to name a replacement, said Marc R. Mutty,
director of communications for the diocese.
   Speculation immediately focused on Maine's auxiliary bishop,
Amedee W. Proulx, who was elevated to the episcopacy in 1975,
becoming the first Franco-American bishop in the state's history
and, at 43, the youngest.
   Proulx, who was not present at O'Leary's announcement,
characterized the resignation as ``a sad loss'' for the diocese and
praised O'Leary's 42 years of service to the church.
   O'Leary was educated at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass.,
and St. Paul's Seminary in Ottawa. Ordained a priest in 1946, he
served in parishes in Portland, Brunswick and Old Orchard Beach,
and as diocesan vice chancellor and chancellor, before being
ordained as auxiliary bishop in 1971.
   Three years later he succeeded Bishop Peter L. Gerety, who
became archbishop of Newark, N.J.

<NOTE>EDS: New thruout with testimony from Rowan.</NOTE>

   Columnist Carl T. Rowan testified Tuesday that
police officials told his son there would be ``no problem'' if
Rowan Sr. handled a weapon that he used to wound a teen-ager
intruding in his backyard.
   Rowan, an outspoken opponent of handgun use and possession, has
been charged with using an unregistered handgun in the June 14
shooting of an intruder in his backyard. If convicted of the
misdemeanor charges, the 63-year-old syndicated columnist could
face up to two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   In 1982, Rowan's son, then an FBI agent, left a .22-caliber
pistol in his father's bedroom after the columnist had received
death threats from persons purporting to be members of the Ku Klux
Klan, Rowan told a District of Columbia Superior Court jury.
   His son was told by District of Columbia police officials that
he had a ``blanket exemption'' from the city's tough handgun
registration laws because he was a federal agent, Rowan also told
the court.
   Earlier, Rowan's son, Carl Jr., testified that twice in 1982,
and once when he was preparing to leave the FBI in 1983, he was
told by police that he did not have to register weapons he had
purchased for personal use.
   After telling police that other members of his family might
handle the weapon, ``they told me that as long as (the gun) was
where it lawfully should be, if others have access to it, it isn't
a problem,'' Rowan Jr. testified.
   Rowan's attorneys have maintained that the columnist and his son
were given inaccurate advice by members of the police department's
gun control unit about the city's gun registration policy, which
stipulates that a weapon can be used only by its registered owner.
   A police official also testified that Rowan broke the law by
using the unregistered weapon, but said he should not have been
prosecuted because he apparently was defending his property.
   Police Inspector James R. Lee, introduced by Rowan's attorney as
an expert witness on gun registration matters, told the court that
Rowan was not authorized to handle the weapon used to shoot a youth
who had taken an unauthorized swim in his backyard pool.
   Lee, however, testified that he would have recommended Rowan not
be prosecuted, since a police investigation revealed that the
columnist thought he was acting in self-defense.
   Detective Charles J. Jones, who arrived at Rowan's house
immediately after the June 14 shooting, told the court that a
sliding glass door at the rear of the house showed signs that
someone had tried to force it open.
   Jones could not say when the door was damaged. Rowan had claimed
that he shot Benjamin Smith, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., because he
was afraid Smith was trying to enter his home.
   Jones also testified that evidence indicated that the shooting
had taken place at close range, near the door.
   ``I don't see how we could be doing much better,'' Rowan's
attorney, Raoul Carroll, said after the proceedings.

   The House on Tuesday approved a compromise
spending bill appropriating $14.8 billion for the operations of the
federal judiciary and the State, Commerce and Justice Departments
for the fiscal year starting Saturday.
   The vote was 269-141 on the measure worked out by negotiators
for the House and Senate, which previously had approved two
separate bills. The Senate has to approve the compromise bill
before it can be sent to the White House for President Reagan's
signature.
   The total is $761 million or 5 percent more than was approved
last year but $655 million or 4 percent less than the Reagan
administration's request.
   Although some agencies received major increases _ including the
Census Bureau, which is preparing for the 1990 census _ the budgets
of some others were frozen or cut back.
   These include the Justice Department's antitrust division and
the U.S. Parole Commission; the Commerce Department's Economic
Development Administration, the Minority Business Development
Agency and the Patent and Trademark Office; the State Department's
maintenance program for buildings abroad; and the Commission on
Civil Rights, the Federal Trade Commission and the office of the
U.S. Trade Representative.
   The agencies, which are required to absorb a recently approved
4.1 percent pay increase, likely will face hiring freezes,
furloughs and reductions in force.
   The overall bill has a number of provisions unrelated to funding.
   The Federal Communications Commission, for example, is required
to reverse a recent ruling and prohibit radio stations from
broadcasting obscene or profane language at any time of the day or
night. The FCC had approved so-called adult broadcasting between
the hours of midnight and 6 a.m.
   The bill also creates the new position of ``special envoy to the
Afghan resistance'' with the rank of ambassador to coordinate U.S.
policy toward Afghan resistance fighters.

<HEAD>First Female Bishop-Elect Says Reaction Positive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Rev. Barbara Harris said Tuesday she was ``a
little incredulous'' at being elected the first female bishop of
the Episcopal Church, but she believes her historic status won't
overshadow her work.
   Some members of the church have objected to bringing a woman
into the line of apostolic succession, but Episcopalian officials
said they don't expect the election will split parishes or stall
the ratification process.
   ``I have ... been elected bishop of the church and not a symbol
or a token and my whole emphasis is ... on the role to which I have
been elected,'' Harris said at a news conference at St. Paul's
Cathedral in Boston, where she was elected Saturday.
   ``I do not feel that much emphasis needs to be placed on what
some people see as the historic or symbolic significance,'' the
58-year-old Philadelphia priest said.
   A few ``no'' votes were heard when Harris was elected to the
position of suffragan, or assisting bishop, for the eastern
Massachusetts diocese, but Harris said she hasn't personally
encountered opposition.
   ``Since I have no communication with some of those groups at the
moment, I would have nothing to say.''
   Harris said she was shocked when she learned she had been
elevated from associate at the Church of the Advocate in
Philadelphia to suffragan of the nation's largest Episcopal
diocese, with 155,000 members.
   ``The reaction that I have received has been overwhelmingly
positive, from bishops, from fellow clergy, from lay people,
throughout the country,'' Harris said.
   The election touched off strong opposition in the Church of
England, which does not elect women to the priesthood.
   The Bishop of London, the Rt. Rev. Graham Leonard, has said that
he would be unable to recognize a woman bishop, but Harris said
that is not a new development.
   ``Bishop Leonard has said that for some time now,'' she said.
   The Rt. Rev. David Johnson, the bishop of Massachusetts, said
questions about how Harris would deal with opposition are
hypothetical since she has not been consecrated yet, adding that
the two would work together on overcoming any possible resistance.
   The election must be ratified by a majority of the bishops
heading the nation's 120 dioceses and a majority of the standing
committees.
   As a transitional measure, parishes have the option of
requesting that male bishops visit them if they feel they cannot
accept a woman bishop, but the request is only good for six years
and Johnson, who voted against the measure, would have to approve
it. He said he has not yet had any such request.

   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., on Tuesday branded
as ``absolutely false'' allegations that he sexually assaulted a
26-year-old woman who spent the night at his home last year.
   ``My family and I have been harassed by this woman for over a
year,'' a somber Adams told reporters in his Senate office as his
wife, Betty, stood at his side.
   Adams said the woman sought $400,000 in ``hush money'' after the
U.S. attorney declined to prosecute the case. ``I will not be
blackmailed ... I am completely outraged. These charges are
absolutely false,'' he said.
   The woman was identified by Adams and in a report she filed with
the Metropolitan Police Department as Kari Tupper, her maiden name.
She has since married George Bridges.
   But Adams, 61, a former Transportation secretary in the Carter
administration, acknowledged he made an ``error in judgment'' by
inviting the woman, who he said was a long-time family friend he
had known since her childhood, to stay at his Washington, D.C.,
house on March 27, 1987 when his wife was out of town.
   He said he offered to let her sleep over because she was ``upset
about her job and not feeling well.'' The woman lived in suburban
Virginia.
   ``Looking back, I should have called her a cab, but at the time,
the suggestion seemed appropriate,'' Adams said in a statement. He
refused to answer questions beyond the statement.
   The woman, now married and living in Seattle, filed a report
with the Metropolitan Police Department on July 24, 1987, alleging
that her breasts and buttocks had been fondled while she was in
Adams' house nearly four months earlier. Adams was not identified
by name in the report.
   She alleged that the incident took place between 9:15 p.m. on
March 27 and 6:30 a.m. the next day, according to the report.
   Capt. William White III of the District of Columbia Police said
the allegation of simple assault was investigated. ``We consider
the matter closed,'' White told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
which reported the story Tuesday. The U.S. attorney's office, which
prosecutes offenses in the District of Columbia, reviewed the case,
but did not press charges.
   Joseph di Genova, the U.S. attorney at the time, told the
Seattle Times, ``It was handled like any other case and nothing was
found. We reviewed and found it totally baseless.''
   The woman could not be reached and her husband refused to
comment.
   Adams gave the following account of what happened last year:
   He said the woman, whom he had helped find a job on Capitol Hill
after his election to the Senate in 1986, had asked to meet him
March 27, 1987 at a swank Italian restaurant in Georgetown to
discuss job opportunities.
   When Adams called her office that day to confirm the dinner
date, he was told she was ill. Assuming the meeting was off, Adams
said he went to play tennis with three friends.
   Later that night, the woman, upset that Adams had not showed up
at the restaurant, called him at his home to ask if she could drop
by, Adams said. The woman had visited the house in the past and had
stored belongings in the basement.
   After the woman arrived, the pair went to a neighborhood
restaurant but found it closed. Neither was feeling very well,
Adams said, so they returned to his home to get her car.
   Once there, the woman went back inside the house. ``At this
point I told her I was exhausted and was going to sleep,'' Adams
said.
   ``I told her that she was welcome to stay at the house if she
was not well enough to drive home. She said she preferred to stay
and then I went to bed, alone. I did not sexually assault the
woman.''
   The woman was a legislative assistant with the House Select
Committee on Aging in 1987 when the alleged incident occurred, the
Post-Intelligencer reported.

<HEAD>New Government Board To Police Film Colorization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation signed by President Reagan on
Tuesday sets up a government board to police the practice of film
colorization.
   The bill, appropriating $10.5 billion for the Interior
Department and related agencies, sets up a National Film
Preservation Board within the department with a budget of $100,000.
   The board is to establish a national film register labeling
movies according to their cultural, historical and aesthetic
interest.
   The board would make a report in the event alterations, such as
colorization, were made in a registered film.
   If the Patent and Copyright Office found a copyright
infringement, it would be required to apply to the appropriate U.S.
attorney's office for a temporary restraining order and make
recommendations for civil proceedings.
   The Office of Management and Budget expressed concern about this
provision of the bill, saying it would inject the Patent and
Copyright Office into an area that is normally the province of the
Justice Department.

   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe of
Britain said Tuesday he will meet with Iran's foreign minister with
the intention of restoring diplomatic relations between the two
nations.
   ``Certainly we are seeking normal relations,'' he told a group
of reporters at a breakfast meeting. ``That is one of the purposes
of the meeting.''
   Asked if an announcement of restoration of relations would be
forthcoming after the meeting, scheduled for Thursday, Howe smiled
and replied: ``Watch this space.''
   Secretary of State George Shultz meanwhile said U.S. diplomats
have no plans to meet with Iranian envoys while they are in New
York during the 43rd U.N. General Assembly.
   Britain withdrew its embassy staff from Tehran last year afer an
Iranian diplomat was arrested on shoplifting charges in Britain and
after Iranian militants beat a British diplomat in Tehran, the
Iranian capital.
   But British-Iranian relations have thawed recently. London sent
a British trade officer to Tehran's trade fair this month, and
British diplomat David Reddaway visited Iran for three weeks in
August.
   Last week, Britain's Foreign Office said other likely topics of
discussion between Howe and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran include the fate of Britons missing in Lebanon and U.N.
efforts to end the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with
department policy, said Britain would maintain its policy of not
negotiating for the release of hostages.
   The missing Britons include Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite;
journalist John McCarthy; and teacher Brian Keenan. All are
believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, although no
claim of responsibility has ever been made for Waite's
disappearance.
   At a news conference in New York, Shultz was asked if American
diplomats might meet with the Iranians during the General Assembly.
   ``There's no plan or nothing that I know of that would bring
such a meeting about,'' Shultz said.
   Shultz said America and Iran carry on dialogue through other
nations that take care of their interests in Washington and Tehran,
and ``We have messages that come to us from countries that are
friends of both countries almost continuously.
   ``We're certainly prepared for direct talks if the setting is
right. But as of now, there's no plan,'' Shultz said.

   A grand jury concluded that a black teen-ager
concocted a story of rape and abduction by a gang of white men that
led to months of racial tension and cover-up allegations, The York
Times reported Wednesday.
   The special state grand jury decided not to indict anyone after
finding overwhelming evidence that 16-year-old Tawana Brawley of
Wappingers Falls lied and helped create the conditions in which she
was found, dazed, wrapped in a garbage bag and smeared with
excrement, the Times reported.
   The black teen-ager claimed she had been kidnapped by a gang of
white men on Nov. 24 and subjected to four days of sexual abuse.
   But the grand jury, in Poughkeepsie, concluded after more than
100 witnesses and a variety of evidence that she had chosen not to
return home and hid for four days in an apartment from which her
family had recently been evicted, the Times said.
   The grand jury speculated she may have feared punishment from
her mother's boyfriend for her late nights out, and that drugs and
her relationships with shady characters may have played a role, the
Times said.
   Miss Brawley's story attracted national attention, especially
when she refused to testify on the advice of family lawyers and
advisers, who then repeatedly accused the state of a cover-up and
leveled charges against public officials and the news media.
   The grand jury subpoenaed Miss Brawley but eventually abandoned
hope of ever hearing her story firsthand and rescinded its vote to
subpoena her, the Poughkeepsie Journal reported Tuesday.
   Prominent people who spoke sympathetically of her plight
included heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and actor Bill
Cosby, who put up a $25,000 reward.
   One of Miss Brawley's advisers, the Rev. Al Sharpton, said
Tuesday that he would not be surprised if the grand jury concluded,
as reported, that Miss Brawley fabricated her claims.
   ``We said from the beginning the grand jury would not come back
with anything,'' he said.
   Sharpton said the Times article was ``nothing but a whole series
of reckless speculations by someone who cannot back it up with one
iota of fact.''
   The black activist repeated charges that the criminal justice
system does not treat minorities fairly.
   ``Tawana is only the last race case that a grand jury has
suggested (was) a fantasy,'' Sharpton told reporters outside
Brooklyn's Criminal Court, where he appeared for a proceeding
stemming from his arrest last December at a civil rights protest.
   He said Miss Brawley, her mother Glenda, who claimed sanctuary
in churches after she was sentenced to 30 days in jail for defying
a subpoena to testify on the case, and their attorneys would appear
at a news conference in New York within 24 hours to respond to the
report.
   In addition to Sharpton, Miss Brawley and her family have been
represented by attorneys Alton Maddox and C. Vernon Mason.
   The grand jury was not expected to comment on the Brawley
advisers' tactics, but Attorney General Robert Abrams, who was
appointed special prosecutor in the case, has said he will file a
separate complaint against the lawyers when the grand jury report
is released.
   Abrams issued a statement in response to the Times report saying
he would not ``confirm or deny the accuracy of any aspect of the
story.''
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, in Manhattan, said he was not
surprised by the grand jury's determination as reported by the
Times.
   ``It's certainly worth a serious inquiry'' into whether lawyers
involved in the case violated ethical rules of their profession,
Giuliani said.
   The grand jury completed its report Friday but it still must be
reviewed by state Supreme Court Justice Angelo J. Ingrassia, the
Times said. It is expected to be released within weeks. The grand
jury is to end its work Oct. 7.
   Miss Brawley has moved with her family to Virginia Beach, Va.,
where she is attending high school. Their telephone number is
unpublished and The Associated Press was unable to reach the family
for comment.
   A neighbor who would not give her name said a van pulled up to
the Brawleys' home Tuesday and the family packed up and moved out.
But Phil Padgett, senior vice president for Oxford Development
Corp. in Bethesda, Md., which manages the Virginia complex, said he
had no reason to suspect the family had moved and that they had
paid rent through September.
   The Times said it obtained evidence summaries compiled in June
and July as well as a summary dated July which contained all
material presented to the grand jury by then and was the last one
to be compiled.
   Abrams said he asked one of his deputies to investigate the
unauthorized disclosure of grand jury material.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Tuesday it is
premature to determine whether the new government in Haiti is
entitled to a resumption of American economic aid.
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, Haiti's new president, told a reporter
in Port-Au-Prince on Monday that the goals of his 10-day-old
government coincide with conditions for U.S. aid.
   But State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told reporters,
``At this time, it is premature to judge the new government of
Haiti on any'' of the conditions imposed by the United States after
it suspended a $100 million aid program when violence halted last
November's elections under the government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Mrs. Oakley said that since the ``failed elections,'' the United
States has made it ``clear that we cannot consider resumption of
assistance until we see concrete progress ... toward the
establishment of an elected civilian government, on economic
development designed to alleviate the plight of Haiti's poor, on
respect for human and civil rights of all Haitians and on
cooperation with the U.S. on narcotics'' traffic control issues.
   The most recent developments have been encouraging, she said,
but the emphasis will be on concrete progress. In the meantime, the
U.S. government has been providing $37 million worth of
humanitarian aid through private and charitable organizations, Mrs.
Oakley said.

   Perceptions of Sunday's presidential debate as a
dead heat have increased, with a plurality of respondents in a
national poll now saying there was no clear winner.
   Forty-two percent in the ABC News poll conducted Monday night
said the debate was a tie or didn't know who won _ more than double
the 20 percent who expressed one of those views after the debate
Sunday night.
   ABC's and other post-debate polls Sunday night indicated no
clear debate winner, and the network's Monday poll indicated that
news reports portraying the confrontation as a tie had increased
perceptions of it as such.
   The new poll, released Tuesday, included likely voters who had
not seen the debate but had heard or read about it. The first poll
was just among those who had watched some or all of the debate.
   In the new poll, 34 percent said Michael Dukakis won the debate
_ down from 44 percent who said so Sunday _ and 24 percent said
Bush won, down from 36 percent who held that view Sunday. A
plurality of those who picked Bush and a majority of those who
picked Dukakis said they won only by a little.
   The poll indicated that the debate reinforced preferences rather
than changing them. Eighty percent said the debate had not switched
their vote and majorities said it had not made them more likely to
vote for either candidate. More than nine in 10 who picked a winner
plan to vote for that man; those who called it a tie were split
evenly in candidate preference.
   ABC conducted the poll among 416 likely voters who had watched
the debate, read about it or heard about it. The margin of error
was plus or minus six percentage points.

   Actress Meryl Streep played lobbyist Tuesday
when she urged lawmakers to approve stepped up safety regulation of
2.6 billion pounds a year of chemical pesticides sprayed on crops.
   ``I'm blatantly trying to draw attention to the issue, mostly
because of the safety of my children's food supply,'' Streep told

   The Senate is considering legislation that would sharply
accelerate safety reviews of pesticides and the banning of those
found too dangerous for use. It would require manufacturers to pay
for the process as well as the cost of storing and disposal of
dangerous chemicals.
   So-called government indemnity payments to pesticide makers
whose products are banned _ $20 million so far _ would be ended
under the plan to reauthorize the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide
and Rodenticide Act.
   Streep expressed surprise at the pack of reporters waiting for
her at Lugar's office but took it in stride, brushing back a wave
of blond hair and saying, ``Well, hi, guys.'' A statement issued
afterward by Lugar's office, however, said she was ``startled by
press interest in her visit.''
   ``I'm obviously not a professional lobbyist,'' the statement
quoted her as saying. ``I'm just sincerely concerned on a personal
level. This is a personal project I've adopted and I'm so
interested in it that you're going to get sick of seeing me on
these issues.''

   A NASA team staged a simulated landing of
the space shuttle Discovery on Tuesday at this emergency landing
site in West Africa, mission director Bob Fleming said.
   The U.S. space agency has constructed special facilities at
Banjul International Airport, Fleming said. He said a 28-person
team was stationed at the site for Thursday's scheduled launch.
   Another 50 NASA staffers would be sent to Banjul if the shuttle
landed there, Fleming said.
   On Thursday, a team of doctors will be standing by and Gambian
firefighters and policemen will be on alert to support the NASA
staff.
   Fleming said Gambia would be the shuttle landing site if two of
Discovery's three engines failed within 2{-8 minutes of takeoff.
   He said a shuttle landing would pose no threat to nearby
residents.
   A village near the airport, Baafuloto, has demanded compensation
for trees that were felled to build a huge lamp post to guide the
shuttle to its landing area.
   The villagers refused an offer of $2,505, and NASA subsequently
said it could no longer negotiate with the villagers because it had
a contract with the Gambia government.

<HEAD>Hispanics to Outnumber Blacks in New York as European White
Population Drops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the year 2000, Hispanics will outnumber
blacks in New York state, and 15 years later, European whites will
no longer be the majority population, according to a new study.
   Indeed, sometime in the first two decades, California, New York
and Texas will join Hawaii as states with no ethnic majority,
according to the report, ``The Population and Labor Force of New
York: 1990 to 2050,'' released Monday.
   ``The rapid growth, numerically as well as proportionately,
among groups who traditionally have not fared very well
educationally or economically raises the potential for a two-tiered
social structure with non-Hispanic whites and many Asians at the
top and most blacks and Hispanics at the bottom,'' said the
authors, Leon F. Bouvier and Vernon M. Briggs Jr.
   Bouvier is an adjunct professor of sociology at Old Dominion
University in Virginia and vice president of the Population
Reference Bureau, a private think tank which published the report.
Briggs is a professor of labor and industrial relations at Cornell
University in Ithaca, N.Y.
   The study's population projections for New York are higher than
those of the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Data Center of the
New York State Department of Commerce. Those two agencies expect
the Empire State's population to reach 18.5 million by 2000, but
Bouvier and Briggs say it may reach 19.6 million.
   The two researchers also predict that the number of New Yorkers
of European descent will drop from 12.6 million in 1990 to 9.6
million in 2020 and 5.2 million in 2050. Meanwhile, the black
population will double, from 2.8 million now to 5.7 million in
2020, dipping to 4.8 million in 2050.
   If the current high levels of immigration continue, and the
fertility rate among white Europeans stays the same, the number of
Hispanics in New York will increase, from 2.5 million now to 5.6
million in 2020, and 8.8 million in 2050, the report said.
   Over the same period, the Asian population will rise from less
than 700,000 now to more than 3.1 million in 2050, according to
Bouvier and Briggs.

   About 15,000 policemen and law enforcement
officers have been sent to the Nagorno-Karabakh region to prevent
further ethnic violence, a government official said Tuesday.
   But he said the situation was returning to normal in
Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-dominated enclave of the southern
republic of Azerbaijan that has pressed for its unification with
neighboring Armenian republic.
   The official, Vasily P. Ignatov, chief of the Interior
Ministry's organizational and inspection directorate, appeared at a
news briefing in Moscow to explain measures taken to quell the
simmering unrest.
   His comments indicated that Soviet authorities still regard the
situation in Nagorno-Karabakh as potentially explosive.
   Ignatov said 30 buildings were set afire in recent unrest there
and that a crowd in the region's center, Stepanakert, placed the
local prosecutor's home under ``virtual siege'' and broke down
doors. He did not say when the siege occurred.
   Radio Moscow reported last Thursday that protesters attacked the
prosecutor's office.
   A government spokesman said last week that one man was killed
and 48 people were injured in clashes that began Sept. 18 between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis.
   A ``special situation'' was declared last Wednesday in
Nagorno-Karabakh and in the adjacent Agdam area of Azerbaijan, a 9
p.m.-6 a.m. curfew was imposed and demonstrations were banned.
   About 600 people have been detained for curfew violations,
Ignatov said, and residents' hunting firearms have been temporarily
confiscated.
   But Ignatov said no crimes have been committed since the curfew
took effect and authorities were considering shortening it.
   The 15,000 extra law enforcement officers are mostly from the
militia, the Soviet Union's uniformed police force, Ignatov said.
He did not say whether all were sent to Nagorno-Karabakh and Agdam,
or whether some were deployed to other regions of Azerbaijan and
Armenia.
   Hundreds of troops have been reported on the streets of Yerevan,
the Armenian capital, where a general strike began Sept. 16.
   Ignatov also accused an independent pro-unification group in
Nagorno-Karabakh of trying to sow ethnic disorder.
   ``The leaders of the ... (group) provoked an attack on forces of
law and order in Stepanakert. They tried to instigate a
demonstration and spread news of so-called clashes between the
Armenian and Azerbaijani populations,'' he said.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported from Yerevan
that strike organizers were stopping buses to prevent people from
going to work. It said 84 people were arrested for violating laws
on rallies, marches and demonstrations.
   In Vienna, Austria, the editor of the Soviet government
newspaper Izvestia said the Soviet Union should resist strong-arm
tactics to settle ethnic disturbances in its south and in the
Baltic area.
   ``There are people who say `Look, what you have done, now it's
time to bang a fist on the table,''' Ivan D. Laptiev said in an
interview in Russian. ``But no, we will not go that way.''

<TEXT>
   An American engineer filed a federal damage suit
Tuesday against the Saudi Arabian government, claiming Saudi
torturers broke his back and legs in 1984 and left him permanently
disabled.
   Scott Nelson, 34, of Davie said he now walks with a cane, has
had four knee operations in the past year and was about to enter
the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., for up to
another year of treatment.
   ``This suit is going to test our laws,'' Nelson said in a
telephone interview Tuesday from an apartment he has taken in
Raleigh, N.C. ``I'm suing them for the damages from the torture I
sustained. They broke my back and my legs and never even charged me
with a crime.''
   Nelson and other Americans who said they suffered at the hands
of Saudi authorities testified before a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee in June 1987.
   In September 1984 Nelson was an engineer for Hospital Corp. of
America, monitoring systems at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital
in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. He told Congress that police picked him up
from the hospital security office after he complained about
hospital safety problems, but said that to this day Saudi
authorities have never explained his detention.
   ``I have no idea why,'' Nelson said. ``In four years of trying
to find out, nobody has been able to give me an idea.''
   Nelson said he was held incommunicado and tortured for 39 days.
   ``They have a unique way of torturing people,'' he said. ``They
shackle your hands and feet and make you do deep knee bends over a
rod until they hear your knees break.''
   The torture and repeated beatings left him with a shattered
knee, ruptured disks in his back and partial damage to his sciatic
nerve, leaving one leg numb. His knee was so badly damaged an
artificial one may have to be implanted to save his leg, which
suffers from poor circulation.
   ``I'm walking now, but I have to use a cane,'' he said. ``I'll
always have the cane.''
   Saudi authorities eventually released him, telling him his
detention had been a mistake, and offering him increasing amounts
of money, he said.
   Nelson said Saudi agents later threatened him and his former
attorney when he insisted on pursuing the matter with the State
Department and Congress. The threats are under investigation by the
FBI, Nelson said.
   Miami FBI spokesman Paul Miller said he could not comment on any
investigation.
   The suit, filed Tuesday in Miami federal court, accused Saudi
authorities of negligence, battery, unlawful detainment, wrongful
arrest and imprisonment, inhuman torture, disruption of normal
family life and mental anguish. It does not specify monetary
damages.
   A spokeswoman for the Saudi Embassy in Washington said she did
not have any immediate reaction to the suit.
   Jorge Duarte, Nelson's attorney, said the case seeks to apply
United Nations human rights standards and international law to the
court suit, something that has rarely been done in the United
States.
   ``We expect it to be a ground-breaking suit,'' Duarte said.
``Prohibition against torture is fairly accepted worldwide.''
   Nelson complained that U.S. authorities were of limited help. He
praised U.S. Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., who served on the House
subcommittee, but said the State Department lost his files after he
appeared on Capitol Hill.
   He said the federal suit against a foreign government in U.S.
courts represents his best chance to get compensation for the
torture and damage he suffered.

   A jury on Tuesday convicted a man of
rape in the first trial among 10 men accused in a case in which a
woman alleges she was attacked by as many as 23 men outside an
illegal cockfight.
   The jury deliberated about 20 minutes before returning the
verdict against Orlando Garza, 24. The panel also suggested a
20-year prison term.
   Garza showed little reaction when the verdict was read. State
District Judge Ricardo Garcia set sentencing Oct. 17.
   The 19-year-old woman told police Garza and other men forced her
to go to a ranch where illegal cockfights were being held near this
south Texas town of about 5,000 people. She said as many as 23 men
raped and sodomized her on the roof of a car the night of March
26-27, sometimes two at a time.
   Garza, who faces a later trial on an aggravated kidnapping
charge, claimed the woman insisted on having sex with him twice
outside the cockfight and that they had been having an affair for
some time.
   The victim said the verdict ``was right, because I don't want
him to go and do it to somebody else.''
   ``I'm relieved, too, because now it will take off some of the
stress and the pain that I had,'' she said in an interview in
Corpus Christi Tuesday afternoon. She said she is prepared to
testify against the other men accused in the case.
   Jurors returned the verdict about 4:15 a.m. They then
deliberated another 20 minutes before deciding to recommend the
maximum sentence for Garza.
   Garza had asked the jury for probation.
   The judge kept the jurors late because he wanted them to reach a
verdict before he left for a judicial conference in Fort Worth
later Tuesday.
   A second defendant is to stand trial next month.
   Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez said he believes
some of the other defendants might want to plea bargain for shorter
prison terms if jurors sentence Garza to prison.

Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Africa's chief negotiator, Neil
Van Heerden, met with a Soviet official Tuesday as the
Angolan-Cuban delegation studied a proposal for the withdrawal of
50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   Withdrawal is the key to ending hostilities between South Africa
and Angola and securing independence for South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia.
   The latest round of U.S.-mediated talks began in the Congo
capital Monday. Hopes for a settlement were high, with President
Reagan telling the United Nations he believed agreement on a Cuban
withdrawal was imminent.
   Van Heerden, director-general of South Africa's foreign affairs
department, talked with the Soviet representative in the Soviet
Embassy. Officials did not identify the Soviet observer.
   South Africa has promised to grant independence to South-West
Africa, Angola's southern neighbor, if the Cubans withdraw within a
year.
   Angola has said it would take four years to complete the
withdrawal.
   Conference sources, who spoke on the condition of not being
identified, said U.S. envoy Chester Crocker sounded out the South
Africans on an Angolan offer to send the Cubans home within three
years. Crocker, an U.S. assistant secretary of state, later met
with the Angolan-Cuban delegation to give South Africa's reply,
they said.
   Although Marxist Angola has said the Cubans were needed only to
block attacks by South African forces, Angola also has been
battling U.S.- and South African-backed guerrillas of UNITA, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   Lt. Gen. Antonio Franca, the chief Angolan negotiator, said
Tuesday that his government would not open talks with Angolan
guerrillas on ending the 13-year-old civil war.
   In South-West Africa, the South African-led territorial army
said Tuesday it had abandoned its plan to lift a 7-year-old,
dusk-to-dawn curfew in the northern war zone because of continued
guerrilla activity.
   The army said last month the curfew in Ovamboland province would
be lifted provisionally during September to see if guerrillas of
the South-West African People's Organization would observe a
cease-fire.
   It said the curfew would be lifted permanently if guerrilla
activity ceased. Military headquarters claimed, however, that 17
skirmishes and several incidents of sabotage took place since Sept.
1.
   SWAPO has fought South African rule in a struggle for
independence since 1966. South Africa has ruled the territory for
73 years.

<TEXT>
   Yulia Akselrod never knew her grandfather,
Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, and she has long rejected his
ideas. But she and her family suffered anyway for their lineage,
and now she is seeking justice.
   Mrs. Akselrod, 52, who immigrated to the United States in 1979,
has written to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev seeking
posthumous rehabilitation for her father, Sergei Sedov, whom she
never met. Though he was not a follower of his ostracized father,
he was exiled to Siberia, where he died.
   Heartened in part by the recent rehabilitation of scores of foes
of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Mrs. Akselrod said in a recent
interview that the Soviet government also ought to clear Trotsky's
name and document his true role in the 1917 revolution.
   Trotsky, once a leader of the revolution, was expelled from the
Soviet Union by Stalin in 1929.
   ``Now, 60 years later, they're trying to decide who was right or
who was wrong,'' Mrs. Akselrod said. ``They're trying to do what an
archeologist does; brush dust from bones. But they're afraid to
brush all the bones, to admit the whole thing was wrong.''
   Mrs. Akselrod, a paint chemist living in New Brunswick, N.J.,
asked Gorbachev in the letter dated March 18 to help establish the
exact time and circumstances of her father's death. She said she is
seeking information, not compensation.
   ``Compensation would never cure (the suffering). What could I
get, what could I ask for?'' she said. ``I want the historical
truth.''
   She said she has not received a reply to her letter.
   The name of Trotsky, taboo since his denunciation by Stalin, was
mentioned publicly for the first time in decades in a speech Nov. 2
by Gorbachev. Earlier this month, the party newspaper Pravda
published an article acknowledging Trotsky's role in the revolution.
   Trotsky helped direct the 1917 coup that brought the Bolsheviks
to power, served as a deputy to Vladimir Lenin and created and
commanded the Red Army in a civil war against
counterrevolutionaries.
   Trotsky, whose real name was Lev Bronshtein, envisioned a
``permament revolution'' that would spread across Europe. But after
Lenin's death in 1924, Trotsky lost a power struggle to Stalin, who
preached ``communism in one country.''
   Trotsky was expelled from the party, deported and reviled as a
traitor. He left the country with his wife, Natalia Sedova, and
their oldest son, Lyova, an active follower of his father. Trotsky
was assassinated in Mexico in 1940.
   Under Stalin, those suspected of being ``Trotskyites'' were
hunted down and imprisoned or killed. But Sedov, who had taken his
mother's name in an effort to avoid persecution, remained in the
Soviet Union.
   ``He decided to stay because he had nothing to do with
(Trotsky)'' and thought he was safe, Mrs. Akselrod said.
   Mrs. Akselrod remembers her mother's glowing accounts of her
father as a man talented in science and math but dogged for most of
his life by the legacy of his father, with whom he never got along.
   In 1936, about three months before Yulia was born, Sedov was
sent to Krasnoyarsk, in Siberia, in one of Stalin's sporadic
crackdowns, she said. According to Western historians, Sedov was
given work as an engineer in a factory and later died in what
Soviet newspapers called an ``accident'' while trying to organize a
mass protest.
   Natalia Sedova later wrote that she was sure her apolitical son
was murdered.
   When Mrs. Akselrod was nearly 2, her mother, Henrietta
Rubenstein, was arrested. Yulia was sent to live with her maternal
grandparents in Moscow.
   In 1951, when she was 15, her grandparents were arrested for
being ``socially dangerous elements.'' Yulia was sent to an
orphanage for three months, then to prison to live with her
grandparents for a month. Then she was shipped off to Kolyma, a
small Siberia village, to live with her mother until her graduation
from high school, she said.
   ``Because of my youth, I was never convicted or sentenced,'' she
said.
   Yulia returned to the Moscow area in 1954, a year after Stalin's
death, studied chemistry and eventually married, telling only two
people of her past.
   ``You cannot imagine Russia in these years. Nobody could say
that name out loud,'' she said. ``I was scared my whole life.''
   Though life improved slightly under Stalin's successors, Mrs.
Akselrod said she was determined to leave the country. Finally
during detente, with the Trotsky name still taboo, Mrs. Akselrod
emigrated with her husband and son.
   Her mother died last year in Tallinn, the capital of Soviet
Estonia, at age 77. With no other relatives alive in the Soviet
Union, Mrs. Akselrod said she finally felt secure seeking more
information about her father's fate as Trotsky's son.
   ``I do not hate him personally. I just hate his ideas,'' she
said of Trotsky. ``This system killed me for 40 years. It is his
(system) _ his and Lenin's.''

<HEAD>Farm Conferees Produce Bill Capping Export Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm lawmakers reached a compromise Tuesday on
an agricultural money bill that placed a $770 million ceiling on
the nation's major export subsidy program in the upcoming fiscal
year.
   Lawmakers are still adding up the items in the massive money
bill, which covers everything from farm subsidies to food stamps,
but the total was between the $44.1 billion House level and the
Senate's $47.3 billion.
   Under the measure, produced by a House-Senate conference
committee, spending on the Export Enhancement Program would be
capped at $770 million in the fiscal year starting Saturday.
   The administration had requested $900 million for the program,
under which major grain companies and other exporters are paid with
surplus crops to spur exports of American farm products.
   Established under the wide-ranging 1985 farm law, the program
has been responsible for stepped up shipments of U.S. wheat and
feedgrains.
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., had pushed for a larger amount but
said the level approved would not put too large a crimp in the
program.
   ``I think this is a strong signal that we are at level of export
assistance that will ensure that we will be able to sell in the
international marketplace anything we have available to sell,'' he
said.
   The committee also put a $200 million ceiling on expenditures
under the Targeted Export Assistance program, which supplies aid
for advertising and other promotion of American agricultural
products overseas.
   The program had been scheduled to increase to $325 million a
year under the 1985 farm program. It has been criticized in the
House recently for providing taxpayer aid for the product's of
specific companies.
   The conferees also adopted a compromise with the administration
that would defer for one year a cut in the amount that production
credit associations would have to pay to bolster the financially
wobbly Farm Credit System.
   Production credit associations are local lending institutions
that are part of the massive, borrower-owned system, which
represents the nation's largest farm lender. The associations were
required to pay assessments under a federal bailout passed by
Congress in 1986.
   The Reagan administration Monday had called on conferees to drop
the provision calling for a lowering of the assessment level,
threatening a presidential veto of the entire bill.

   A cold front extended from the Great Lakes into the central High
Plains on Tuesday, sending rain showers over parts of Nebraska and
Colorado.
   Other parts of the West also got rain.
   A low pressure area was expected to enhance the strength of the
front and create high winds. Gusts between 30 mph and 40 mph were
reported in parts of northeast Oregon and in Idaho and Wyoming.
   Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms continued over parts of the
central Gulf Coast and into Florida. Over 1\ inches of rain was
reported at Pensacola, Fla.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
a half-inch at Daytona Beach, Fla., and a quarter-inch at
Grangeville, Ind.
   A high-pressure system extended over New England and the
mid-Atlantic region into the lower Mississippi Valley, with
temperatures in the 60s and 70s. A similar system extended along
the Pacific Coast into the Southwest, where highs were in the upper
80s and 90s.
   Temperatures around the country at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Butte, Mont., to 100 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif. The
low in the nation Tuesday morning was 27 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The outlook for Wednesday called for widespread rain and
thunderstorms from the Northern Plains through the upper
Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes region into the lower
Missouri Valley and western Oklahoma. Scattered showers were
expected in northern Maine, and afternoon showers and thunderstorms
over southern Florida.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s or 80s across
much of the nation east of the Great Plains. Highs in the 50s were
forecast from the northern Plains into upper Michigan and northern
New England. Highs in the 60s were expected from the middle
Missouri Valley through the lower Great Lakes into the remainder of
New England. Highs in the 60s or 70s were forecast over much of the
West, with 90s across much of Texas and into the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands Rally In Serbia in Ethnic Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 10,000 Slav students boycotted
high schools Tuesday in Kosovo, sources said, and an estimated
80,000 people rallied in Serbia to protest alleged persecution of
Slavs in the southern province.
   The students joined a school boycott that began in Kosovo's
provincial capital of Pristina last Thursday to protest purported
harassment by ethnic Albanian classmates, said the sources in
Pristina, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At the rally in the Serbian city of Cacak, 75 miles southwest of
Belgrade, demonstrators demanded that leaders responsible for the
trouble in Kosovo be held accountable, the official Tanjug news
agency reported.
   ``The people have said what they had to say, now it is up to the
Central Committee of the League of Communists (Communist Party) to
take action,'' Bole Lukic, a local Communist leader, told cheering
protesters.
   He referred to a forthcoming Central Committee session which is
expected to deal with the Kosovo issue and may result in top
personnel changes.
   ``As long as radical changes do not take place ... Serbia will
not calm down,'' Lukic declared.
   The Slav minority in Kosovo, Yugoslavia's poorest region, claims
it is being harassed, intimidated and forced to leave the province
by the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
   Most of the Slavs are Christians. Most Kosovo Albanians are
Moslems.
   The Serbian republic, one of six republics constituting
Yugoslavia, includes Kosovo.
   Earlier Tuesday, about 3,000 Slav children from Klina and Pec
traveled 30 miles by train to Pristina, determined to stage a
street protest to air their grievances, the sources told The
Associated Press.
   Also Tuesday, about 200 Slav university professors and students
organized a protest meeting at Pristina University, saying they
will not attend classes scheduled to start Oct. 1, the sources said.
   Fearing ethnic violence, the federal government sent police
reinforcements this month to Kosovo. The Albanians there have not
reacted to date to a recent spate of protest rallies organized by
Serbs and Montenegrins.
   Kosovo's Albanians are descended from Illyrian tribes that
populated the area from ancient times. Slavs conquered Kosovo in
the seventh century, but were defeated in 1389 by Turks who ruled
the region until 1913.
   Kosovo borders Albania.

<TEXT>
   Ed Flanders, who portrayed a kind-hearted
hospital administrator on television's ``St. Elsewhere,'' was
injured when his convertible crashed down a 400-foot hillside, the
Highway Patrol said.
   Flanders, 53, was driving near Salyer, Calif., Monday afternoon
when his car left the road and went down the embankment, said Sgt.
Vern Crogh.
   Flanders, who was ejected from the vehicle, was taken to Mad
River Community Hospital with head and chest injuries. A nursing
supervisor said Tuesday that Flanders was in guarded condition in
the intensive care unit.
   Flanders played the compassionate but self-righteous Dr. Donald
Westphall on ``St. Elsewhere.''
   The character left the series in October 1987 with a flourish,
by exposing his rear end to a character playing an executive of a
health organization that had taken over St. Eligius Hospital.
   When Flanders returned for the filming of the nostalgic final
show of the six-year series, he upset producers by refusing to
stick to his lines and instead delivered a rambling speech on death.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev asked the United States and
Pakistan on Tuesday to ``come to their senses'' and stop arming
guerrillas fighting the Afghan government.
   He said Pakistan was trying to install leaders in Afghanistan to
its own liking, no matter what the Afghan people want. He alleged,
in remarks carried by the official Tass news agency, that the
United States has been increasing deliveries of weapons to the
guerrillas, including Stinger missiles.
   ``Do they (Pakistan and the United States) not contradict the
spirit of the Geneva accords and the interests of a peace
settlement?'' the Soviet leader asked. ``This is a very serious
thing, and we have a right to expect Pakistan and the U.S. to come
to their senses and give up adventurist actions.''
   Gorbachev made his comments at a luncheon for visiting Laotian
leader Kaysone Phomvihane.
   Under Geneva accords signed in April, the Soviet Union began
pulling out its more than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan on May 15
and is to finish by Feb. 15. Soviet troops intervened in Marxist
Afghanistan in December 1979.
   The accords do not require a cutoff of Soviet aid to its ally,
the Afghan government, or of U.S. and Pakistani aid to Afghan
guerrillas. They do oblige the superpowers not to interfere in
Afghanistan's internal affairs, however.
   Gorbachev said problems in the Afghan settlement were an example
of a ``deficit of responsibility'' by ``some of our Western
partners.''

<HEAD>Court Delays Teamsters' Mailing of Ballots on New Auto Transport
Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the
Teamsters Union to wait five days before mailing out ratification
ballots on a newly renegotiated three-year contract covering some
20,000 drivers of auto transport trucks.
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth issued a temporary
restraining order prohibiting the union from mailing the ballots
until next Monday after dissident Teamsters complained that a
``quickie'' vote would preclude them raising a campaign to defeat
the accord.
   The Teamsters had planned to mail out the ballots this Wednesday
on a new tentative contract reached with some 30 auto transport
companies late last week.
   An earlier tentative accord reached in July was rejected by 72
percent of the covered members in the union, prompting a reopening
of negotiations that resulted in last week's agreement.
   Both tentative accords provided for yearly 40 cents-an-hour pay
increases _ or 2.5 percent annually _ for drivers now making about
$16 an hour. The agreements also provided total increases of $30 a
week in employer contributions to jointly administered pension and
health funds for each covered worker.
   The renegotiated pact eliminates ``new business'' concessions
included in the earlier accord that had been opposed by
rank-and-file members and increases unloading pay in some areas of
the country.
   Lamberth issued the order in response to a petition by two
Michigan members of Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a
10,000-member dissident faction.
   The petition claimed that the union's plan to mail out the
ballots on Wednesday, six days after the new accord was announced,
was ``well-calculated to prevent opponents from obtaining enough
information about it to disseminate their views to fellow members.''
   The TDU dissidents had sought a 10-day delay, but an attorney
for them claimed victory with Lamberth's order.
   ``It's not ideal, but we'll take second best,'' said Paul Levy,
a public interest law firm attorney retained by TDU. ``If the
ballots had been mailed out tomorrow, we wouldn't have had time to
get our leaflets out.''
   The union has set the third week of October for tabulating the
ballots.

<HEAD>Expert Disputes Claim That Guerrillas Could Have Detonated Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An electronics expert said Monday it was
impossible for three IRA members to have set off a radio-controlled
bomb from where they were standing when British soldiers, claiming
a bombing was imminent, gunned them down.
   Michael Scott, a Dublin electronics engineer, told an inquest
that he tested various radio transmissions from the site where the
March 6 shootings occurred to a car parked about a mile away.
   British commandos have claimed that they killed the three Irish
Republican Army guerrillas, who were unarmed, because they feared
the guerrillas were about to detonate a radio-controlled bomb in a
car parked about a mile away.
   But Scott said even if the guerrillas had tried, ``as an
academic, I must say it wouldn't have happened.'' Scott said walls
and buildings would have blocked the radio signals.
   Scott's testimony came on the 16th day of an inquest by
Gibraltar Coroner Felix Pizzarello and an 11-man jury into the
March 6 shooting deaths of Mairead Farrell, 31, Daniel McCann, 30,
and Sean Savage, 24.
   The IRA has acknowledged the three were on ``active service,''
meaning they were on a mission to strike at British targets at the
time of their deaths.
   Scott's testimony countered that of a senior British
intelligence official and a bomb expert in the elite military
Special Air Service, the squad whose members killed the IRA
guerrillas. That witness said a bomb could have been detonated by
remote control.
   On Monday, a Gibraltar constable claimed that Farrell was
reaching into her purse when the soldiers opened fire. Another
witness, a Gibraltar resident who had been looking out her
apartment window, testified Friday that Farrell had been raising
her arms in surrender.
   The inquest has no power of prosecution. Its aim is to determine
whether the shootings were lawful.
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
claimed the shootings are evidence of an unofficial
``shoot-to-kill'' policy against members of the outlawed IRA.
   The mostly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in
predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland and unite it with the
Irish Republic. The March 6 killings triggered a renewed round of
IRA attacks on British soldiers.

   George Bush courted the middle class on Tuesday with a modest
plan to allow small savers to ``put something away for a rainy
day'' and defer taxes on the interest. Michael Dukakis criticized
Bush's proposal for providing average Americans with a mere ``20
bucks a year'' while the rich receive a ``$40 billion giveaway.''
   The vice president got in the snappiest one-liner of the
campaign day when he told an audience at Miami University in Ohio
that a current television show ``reminds me of what interest rates
might be if the Democrats get back in again. It's called
`thirtysomething.'''
   The Democrats ridiculed right back.
   Asked what a Dan Quayle administration might look like,
Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen laughed and
said, ``very exciting.'' Asked later what he meant, Bentsen laughed
again and said, ``I'll leave it at that.''
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle campaigned in
Bentsen's home state of Texas, where he challenged Dukakis to
resign his membership in the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``Let him today resign from the ACLU. Let him renounce all their
bizarre positions. Let him make clear _ no more waffling and
backsliding _ that he no longer supports the outrageous stands that
the ACLU takes,'' Quayle told a Houston rally of Asian-Americans.
   Speaking before a crowd of several thousand people, Bush made a
distinction for the first time about his opposition to the ACLU,
which he uses as a device to attack Dukakis as a liberal because he
belongs to the organization.
   ``I don't have a quarrel with their work in, you know, helping
whatever position they take in terms of defending the right of an
individual,'' Bush said, ``but I just don't agree with the major
positions that organization has taken'' in terms of legalizing
pornography and its opposition to tax exemptions for religious
institutions.
   Meanwhile, a national poll released Tuesday found that
perceptions of Sunday's presidential debate as a dead heat have
increased, with a plurality of respondents saying there was no
clear winner.
   Forty-two percent in the ABC News poll conducted Monday night
said the debate was a tie or didn't know who won _ more than double
the 20 percent who expressed one of those views after the debate
Sunday night.
   The poll of 416 likely voters also found that 34 percent said
Dukakis won while 24 percent said Bush turned in the best
performance. The survey, which included voters who had not seen the
debate but had heard or read about it, had a margin of error of
plus or minus six percentage points.
   The two vice presidential candidates are scheduled to debate on
Oct. 5 in Omaha, Neb., and the jockeying for advantage already was
well under way.
   Democrats have criticized Quayle unsparingly during the
campaign, but in an apparent bid to raise expectations about the
Indiana senator's debate performance, Bentsen characterized him as
a skillful debater.
   ``I think Dan Quayle is going to do very well in the debate,''
said the Texas senator. He said Quayle loves to debate on the
Senate floor and ``I'm not so confrontational.''
   The vice president upgraded his own self-evaluation in last
Sunday night's debate with Dukakis. ``I feel better today about the
way the debate went than I did the night of the debate.'' He joked
about the ``handwringers'' on his staff who feared he would
``massively foul it up.''
   Bush outlined his plan for a tax break for low- and
middle-income people in a speech in Columbus, Ohio. He called the
program an individual savings account and said it would help the
nation ``gain better control over our long-term economic future''
as well as help savers ``put something away for a rainy day.''
   One adviser said the tax deferred on interest the first year on
$1,000 would save roughly $12 for a taxpayer in the 15 percent
income tax bracket and slightly more in later years.
   Bush said the plan would allow many Americans to lock up as much
as $1,000 a year _ in accounts of five years or more _ with federal
income tax deferred. When withdrawn, the accumulated interest would
be taxed at the saver's income tax rate then in effect.
   The tax break would be fully available to taxpayers with
adjusted gross income of less than $50,000 a year. It would
gradually phase out until it disappeared for someone with adjusted
gross income of $60,000.
   Bush officials estimated the program would benefit 8 million
Americans, at a cost to the Treasury about $70 million in 1989 and
$550 million by 1993.
   Bush proposed his savings plan after weeks of being criticized
by Dukakis for an earlier proposal to cut the maximum tax rate on
capital gains.
   Speaking to a crowd in the Chicago suburb of Melrose Park,
Dukakis poked funs at Bush's program, juxtaposing the savings from
the plan against the GOP nominee's proposal to cut the capital
gains tax.
   ``Twenty bucks a year _ that's Mr. Bush's solution for average
Americans,'' Dukakis said referring to his campaign's calculation
of the plan's financial benefits.
   ``He says it will make them (average Americans), and here I'm
quoting, `better able to afford a home, pay for college, start a
business.' Twenty bucks a year, who's he kidding?''
   In a statement, Dukakis said: ``Today, after I pointed that out
to him on Sunday night, he discovered the rest of America and he
told just what his priorities are. He wants to give the wealthiest
1 percent of Americans $30,000 and the rest of us are going to get
twenty bucks. That's a new definition of trickle-down.''
   Earlier, Dukakis renewed his attack in an appearance in Peoria,
Ill., calling the capital gains cut a ``five-year, $40 billion
giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, people making more than
$200,000 a year.''
   The Democrat also depicted Bush as no friend of Social Security
and Medicare who cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate several
years ago in favor of a plan to cut cost-of-living increases in
federal benefits for retirees.
   ``The first time George Bush ran for the Senate he opposed
Medicare and called it `socialized medicine,''' Dukakis said. ``The
first time George Bush ran for president he called Social Security
`basically a welfare program.'''

   Police on Tuesday arrested one of the
leaders of last year's bloody attempt to topple President Corazon
Aquino and said the renegade colonel was recruiting dissident
soldiers for a new coup plot.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, commander of the Manila district,
said Lt. Col. Eduardo Matillano was arrested before dawn in a raid
on a hotel in Quezon City after informants reported seeing him
dining there.
   Biazon said Matillano, former constabulary chief in Nueva Ecija
province, was the ``chief recruiter'' of right-wing military
dissidents and had been traveling throughout the country seeking to
convert soldiers to his cause.
   Matillano played a major role in the failed coup on Aug. 28,
1987, that was led by former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan,
who remains at large.
   Matillano led an assault on the government television station
and a hotel near armed forces headquarters during the attempt, in
which at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded.
   He was arrested a short time later and was charged with
rebellion, but escaped last April during a visit to a dentist.
Honasan was arrested last December but fled a prison ship in Manila
Bay, also in April.
   Biazon said Matillano's arrest followed the recent capture of 63
followers of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. He said those
arrests were kept secret for security.
   He said Honasan's group apparently forged an alliance with other
renegade officers linked to Marcos, adding: ``Matillano's capture
severely cripples recent attempts by ultra-rightist elements to
destabilize the government.''
   Elsewhere, military chief of staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered
reinforcements sent to southeastern Luzon on Tuesday after
communist rebels killed 10 soldiers and a civilian in a weekend
ambush and captured five sergeants who were carrying a unit payroll
worth up to $50,000.
   In another incident, police said Sgt. Victor Dizon was driving
to work in suburban Malabon Tuesday when four attackers fired,
killing him instantly.
   Police said the attack was similar to those used by communist
rebels, who have killed scores of police and soldiers in the
capital this year.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill To Impose Sanctions Against Iraq For Poison Gas
Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House overwhelmingly approved legislation
Tuesday imposing sanctions against Iraq as a ``concrete expression
of outrage'' over that nation's alleged poison gas attacks against
Kurdish villages.
   The strongly bipartisan vote was 388-16.
   The legislation goes to conference with the Senate, which passed
a far more punitive sanctions bill earlier in the month.
   The House bill would impose sanctions on Iraq in two bites, some
to take place immediately and others to go into effect if Iraq
continues to use poison gas.
   The Reagan administration opposes both the House and Senate
versions of the legislation on grounds that they ``would not bring
us closer'' to the goal of ending Iraq's use of chemical weapons.
   In debate on the measure, which took place Monday evening, some
members said that sanctions would be counterproductive and hurt
U.S. business interests.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., said that while Iraq apparently has
been involved in ``a heinous act,'' economic sanctions are unwise
because they hurt ``American employers and American employees.''
   ``I think it is well intentioned but represents imprudent
policy,'' Frenzel said.
   House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
replied:
   ``There comes a time in the life of every nation where you take
a strong moral stand, and this is one of those times.''
   ``We must never yield to evil,'' said Rep. John Edward Porter,
R-Ill.
   ``It is imperative that the response we give not be one of
silence,'' said Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif. ``The bill before
us is ... the first concrete expression of outrage against the use
of chemical weapons.''
   Fascell called the sanctions bill ``a measured response.''
   The 16 House members voting against the sanctions bill were
Reps. Larry Combest, R-Texas; Tom DeLay, R-Texas; Bob Dorgan,
R-Calif.; Glenn English, D-Calif.; Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.; Fred
Grandy, R-Iowa; Tim Johnson, D-S.D.; Jim Jontz, D-Ind.; H. Martin
Lancaster, D-N.C.; David R. Nagle, D-Iowa; Howard C. Nielson,
R-Utah; Timothy J. Pepper, D-Minn.; Toby Roth, R-Wis.; James
Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.; Bob Stump, R-Ariz.; and Pat Williams, D-Mont.
   The 27 House members not voting were Reps. Beryl Anthony Jr.,
D-Ark.; Doug Barnard Jr., D-Fla.; Don Bonker, D-Wash.; Beau
Boulter, R-Texas; William Broomfield, R-Mich; Sonny Callahan,
R-Ala.; John Conyers, D-Mich.; Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa.; Wayne
Dowdy, D-Miss.; Mike Espy, D-Miss.; Ronnie Flippo, D-Ala.; Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.; J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.; W. G. Heffner, D-N.C.;
Ed Jenkins, D-Ga.; Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.; Delbert Latta, R-Ohio; Marvin
Leath, D-Texas; Donald Lukens, R-Ohio; Connie Mack, R-Fla.; Buddie
MacKay, D-Fla.; Alfred McCandless, R-Calif.; Bob McEwen, R-Ohio;
Claude Pepper, D-Fla.; George Wortley, R-N.Y.; Chalmers T. Wylie,
R-Ohio; C. W. Young, R-Fla.
   Under its terms, an immediate ban would be imposed on the export
to Iraq of weapons, sensitive high technology, and chemicals used
in the production of chemical weapons.
   If Iraq continues to use chemical weapons, the president would
be authorized to impose further sanctions from a list included in
the bill.
   These include restricting the import of Iraqi petroleum and
other products, restricting U.S. exports, including agricultural
products, denying U.S. financial credits and credit guarantees,
downgrading diplomatic relations and opposing loans to Iraq by
international lending institutions.
   The president is authorized to waive the sanctions required and
authorized by the bill if he can certify that Iraq is not using
chemical weapons and has provided reliable assurances _ such as
permitting on-site inspection _ that it will not use chemical
weapons in the future.
   The House Ways and Means Committee softened the restrictions of
the bill by permitting U.S. exporters to continue to sign contracts
with Iraq until the president actually decides to restrict exports.
   But in a separate action, the House approved legislation Tuesday
that seeks to bar USX Corp. from selling its shuttered Texas Works
steel-making plant to Iraq.
   USX spokesman William P. Ryder said last week that the deal for
the Texas Works plant fell through because a letter of intent
expired on Sept. 21 without action by Iraq.
   The original language of the sanctions bill would have protected
only those contracts signed before Sept. 15.

<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers from Iran and Iraq are
to resume direct peace talks Saturday in New York, an official
said, the first meeting between the warring nations since peace
talks fell apart in Geneva on Sept. 13.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and a special
mediator plan to meet separately Friday with Tariq Aziz of Iraq and
Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran, said Francois Guiliani, the
secretary-general's spokesman.
   The two foreign ministers then will have face-to-face
negotiations on Saturday with Perez de Cuellar and the mediator,
Ambassador Jan K. Eliasson of Sweden, Guiliani said Tuesday.
   The talks, aimed at ending the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war,
began in Geneva on Aug. 25, five days after a U.N.-sponsored truce
took effect.
   Negotiations bogged down over Iraq's demand that the
Shaat-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Persian Gulf, be
cleared of sunken ships and silt as the next step in the peace
process.
   Disputes over navigation rights in the waterway was a main cause
of the war. A 1975 treaty puts the border down the middle of the
passage, but Iraq is seeking control of the entire waterway.
   The U.N. cease-fire resolution outlining an end to the Persian
Gulf war also calls for the sides to withdraw to internationally
recognized borders, an exchange of prisoners of war, and a formal
determination of who started the conflict.
   Iraq initially endorsed the U.N. cease-fire resolution in July
1987, but Iran did not accept it until a year later, after a series
of battlefield defeats.

   Republican George Bush, criticized for
advocating tax breaks for the wealthy, proposed a plan Tuesday that
would offer tax-deferred interest to low- and middle-income
Americans on long-term savings deposits.
   Bush said such ``individual savings accounts'' would help the
nation ``gain better control over our long-term economic future''
by increasing savings.
   ``Americans have increasingly gotten away from the sensible
frugality that says, `put some away for a rainy day,''' Bush said.
   The Dukakis campaign criticized the proposal as ``pitching
pennies'' at the financial struggles of working families because it
amounted to a tax break of 40 cents a week.
   Bush unveiled the proposal before the Ohio Republican state
convention on his second visit to Columbus in 11 days. The state,
offering a prize of 23 electoral votes, is a key battleground in
the election fight.
   In a later appearance across the Ohio River in Kentucky, Bush
softened his assaults on the American Civil Liberties Union, which
have become part of his attack on Dukakis.
   ``I need to carry Ohio to win the presidency of the United
States of America,'' Bush declared earlier in the day at a rally
before thousands of cheering students at Miami University in
Oxford, Ohio.
   He was headed Wednesday to Illinois, where he will take a bus
tour.
   As described by Bush, the savings plan would allow interest to
accumulate tax deferred for funds put on deposit for at least five
years. A maximum of $1,000 a year could be deposited.
   When withdrawn, the interest would be taxed at the saver's tax
rate then in effect.
   Michael Boskin, a Stanford University economist who advises
Bush's campaign, offered this example: If a person put $1,000 into
such an account and if it paid about 8 percent annual interest,
that would yield about $80 in interest income.
   For those in the 15 percent tax bracket, that would defer some
$12 in taxes the first year, slightly more in later years. It would
cost the Treasury about $70 million in 1989 if that were the first
year in effect, growing to $550 million by 1993, Bush's campaign
estimated.
   The full interest deduction would be available only to taxpayers
with adjusted gross incomes of less than $50,000 a year. Taxpayers
with adjusted incomes of $60,000 or more would not be eligible for
the program.
   Bush's campaign staff estimated that more than 8 million
Americans would take advantage of the plan.
   ``They will be helping themselves become better able to afford a
home, pay for college or start a business, and they will be helping
America _ by increasing investment and economic growth,'' Bush said.
   Bush has been repeatedly attacked by Dukakis for advocating a
cut in the maximum capital gains tax from its current level of 33
percent down to 15 percent. Most people who pay the tax are charged
about 28 percent.
   Dukakis, speaking in a Chicago suburb, said the Bush savings
proposal would yield the average family $20 a year. ``Twenty bucks
a year, who's he kidding?'' Dukakis said.
   ``Today, after I pointed that out to him on Sunday night, he
discovered the rest of America and he told just what his priorities
are,'' he said. ``He wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of
Americans $30,000 and the rest of us are going to get twenty bucks.
That's a new definition of trickle-down.''
   Bush campaigned later Tuesday at a rally at a riverfront park in
Owensboro, Ky., after a brief ride on sightseeing boat on the Ohio
River. When a reporter tried to ask Bush about the minimal impact
of his savings plan, the question was interrupted and drowned out
by the blaring noise of the boat's horn.
   ``Thank you very much,'' Bush said, turning away with a smile.
   Speaking before a crowd of several thousand people, Bush made a
distinction for the first time about his opposition to the ACLU,
which he uses as a device to attack Dukakis as a liberal because he
belongs to the organization.
   ``I don't have a quarrel with their work in, you know, helping
whatever position they take in terms of defending the right of an
individual,'' Bush said, ``but I just don't agree with the major
positions that organization has taken.''
   In his Columbus speech, Bush avoided any attack on Dukakis and
tried to set a tone of compassion.
   ``The answer is up to us,'' he said. ``The answer is in each
individual act of kindness multiplied by thousands and tens of
thousands. The answer is in a new engagement in the pain of
others.''
   At Miami University, Bush entertained the students with a series
of barbs aimed at Dukakis.
   Referring to a television series, Bush said, ``There's a TV show
that reminds me of what interest rates might be if the Democrats
get back in again. It's called ``thirtysomething.''

<HEAD>Reports: Captured Beachfront Must Be Returned To Egypt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international team of arbitrators has ruled
that Israel must return a disputed beachfront resort area to Egypt,
Israeli media reported Tuesday.
   The ruling, which has been under consideration since May 1987,
is to be announced Thursday in Geneva.
   Israel captured Taba, a beach resort along the Red Sea, in the
1967 Middle East war and retained the property when it returned the
Sinai Desert to Egypt in 1982.
   The dispute over the 250-acre area has been a key sticking point
in Egyptian-Israeli relations. The two countries signed a
U.S.-mediated peace treaty in 1979.
   Israel radio and newspapers said the arbiters, who have visited
the site and studied old maps and thousands of documents from both
sides, had decided to return all the property to Egypt.
   A Foreign Ministry official declined comment on the reports but
said Israel planned to honor whatever decision the arbiters reached.
   He noted that if Taba were returned to Egypt, some compensation
would likely have to be made to Israeli citizens who own a hotel
and a beach resort along the half-mile beachfront.
   In Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Ministry officials said President
Hosni Mubarak's government was so confident the arbiters will
decide in Egypt's favor that the ministry already was preparing a
statement to be issued after the announcement.
   A state-run trave agency in Cairo, Misr Sinai Tourist Co., has
begun advertising trips to the Taba area. ``Now Taba is the talk of
the whole world,'' said the advertisement in the English-language
Egyptian Gazette.
   In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's hardline Likud bloc
and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' left-leaning Labor Party clashed
over Taba, an issue expected to surface in the elections campaign.
Israel's parliament elections are scheduled for Nov. 1.
   The Likud said if the decision goes against Israel, it would be
proof of its contention that Israel cannot expect a fair hearing
from an international body and should not agree to an international
conference on Middle East peace.
   ``We should not agree beforehand to the demands of the other
side,'' Likud legislator Ronnie Milo said on Israel army radio. ``I
accuse Shimon Peres and Labor officials, who threaten that if we
don't accept some demand, everything will collapse.''
   Peres, who favors an international conference, said he still
believed Israel could sign a peace treaty with neighboring Jordan
without necessarily returning all the territory it occupies, as was
the case with Egypt.
   ``I'm also not sure we had to reach such a treaty with Egypt.
But I supported it because it was the only one in the field,'' he
said on the radio in a telephone interview from New York.
   Peres is scheduled to meet with his Egyptian counterpart, Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, in New York on Thursday. The two leaders are expected
to work out how to implement the ruling.
   The five-member Taba arbitration team is made up of Swedish
chief arbitrator Gunar Lagergren, Pierre Bellet of France, Dietrich
Schindler of Switzerland, Hamed Sultan from Egypt and Ruth Lapidot
from Israel.
   Israel also captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank
from Jordan in the 1967 war.

   Diplomats at the French Embassy are
threatening to strike in a pay dispute, a source told The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas met in New York on Monday
with representatives of French diplomatic missions in the United
States and Canada to see whether he could defuse the problem and
dispatched an aide to talk to staff in Washington, said the source,
who refused to be identified.
   The Washington diplomats, who had planned to walk out this week,
agreed to delay any protest until after French President Francois
Mitterrand makes a one-day visit to Washington on Thursday.
   ``It has nothing to do with the visit, and they didn't want to
disrupt it,'' said the source who is close to a committee
representing staff.
   Dumas reportedly promised to look into the matter.
   Some 80 percent of the 250 embassy employees in Washington,
ranging from typists to top diplomats, already staged a walkout on
Sept. 9, and other diplomatic missions also have been involved in
the dispute, the source said.
   The protest concerns a decision to cut foreign-living allowances
by 20 percent for staffers who live in some 90 countries where
compensation is based on the value of the U.S. dollar, which has
been rising against the franc this year.
   There have been protests in other posts in North America and
elsewhere, the source said.
   Besides the embassy in Washington and mission to the United
Nations in New York, the French have 12 consulates in the United
States.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, appealing to
``mainstream Americans,'' assailed George Bush on Tuesday as an
enemy of Social Security and Medicare who might cut both programs.
   The Democratic presidential nominee traveled to the city that
has become a symbol of middle America to combat his Republican
rival's suggestion that he is outside the nation's mainstream.
   ``If you want to see the difference between George Bush and me
on the things that concern mainstream America, look at where we
stand on Social Security and Medicare,'' Dukakis told a rally
outside Peoria's city hall.
   He said Bush had called the Medicare health plan ``socialized
medicine'' while running for the Senate years ago, and that in
1980, while a presidential candidate, Bush called Social Security
``basically a welfare program.''
   ``When it comes to Social Security and George Bush, don't read
his lips, read his record,'' Dukakis said in a remark that turned
around Bush's ``read my lips'' declaration he would not raise taxes.
   ``He was wrong then and he's wrong now,'' the Democrat said.
   Later, during a speech in the Chicago suburb of Melrose Park,
Dukakis riduled a proposal made Tuesday by George Bush to allow
small savers to sock away up to $1,000 a year and defer paying
taxes on the interest.
   ``Twenty bucks a year _ that's Mr. Bush's solution for average
Americans,'' Dukakis said referring to his campaign's calculation
of the benefits from the plan,
   ``He says it will make them, and here I'm quoting, `better able
to afford a home, pay for college, start a business,''' he said.
``Twenty bucks a year, who's he kidding?
   ``Today, after I pointed that out to him on Sunday night, he
discovered the rest of America and he told just what his priorities
are. He wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans $30,000
and the rest of us are going to get twenty bucks. That's a new
difinition of trickle-down.''
   Dukakis fell on his face when he tripped while climbing stairs
to the stage at the Melrose Park event. He got up, showed no sign
of being injured or upset, and shrugged it off when asked about it
later.
   ``It happens in every campaign at least once,'' he said.
   While there he was presented with a shirt bearing the name
Eureka College, an Illinois school that is President Reagan's alma
mater.
   On the back were the words, ``We like Dutch but we love the
Duke.''
   Seeking to encourage the notion that he had tightened the
presidential race with a strong debate performance two days
earlier, Dukakis escalated his assault on Bush's views on Social
Security and Medicare.
   The Massachusetts governor repeatedly referred to his debate
performance, asking the Peoria crowd ``How many of you thought I
won?'' and drawing a thunderous cheer.
   He said Bush ``said our family farms must be doing just fine''
in the debate.
   ``He must be kidding,'' Dukakis said, saying there were 200,000
family farms and half a million farm-related manufacturing jobs
lost in eight years.
   Dukakis said both Social Security and Medicare were likely
targets for Bush to cut to finance additional defense spending and
to offset a cut in the tax on capital gains, a tax break Dukakis
contended would primarily benefit the wealthy.
   He recalled Bush's tie-breaking Senate vote to cut
cost-of-living increases for Social Security, and repeated his
suggestion that Bush might tap the Social Security trust fund.
   ``Now, if Mr. Bush wants another tax give-away for the rich, and
if he can't think of a single weapons system in the budget that he
opposes ... and if he says he's going to bring down the deficit,
then how's he going to do it without raiding the Social Security
trust fund and trying to cut Social Security and Medicare again?''
Dukakis said.
   ``My friends,'' he added, ``Social Security is not a `welfare
program.' Social Security is a contract between generations, and
... I will never break that contract.''
   Dukakis campaigned in Illinois, a tossup industrial state, a day
before Bush was taking an eight-hour bus trip across the state.
   Dukakis appeared with former Democratic rival Sen. Paul Simon in
Peoria, the city recalled in political memory for the Nixon
administration's reference to it as a barometer of middle America.

   Officials running a police training school
Tuesday defended an exercise session that hospitalized 16 cadets,
including one who required a liver transplant.
   The cadets were treated at hospitals beginning Sept. 19, the
first day of classes, with ailments ranging from exhaustion and
dehydration to kidney failure.
   Gary F. Egan, executive director of the Massachusetts Justice
Training Council, said no cadet was denied water during the
training and that activity on the first day was no more strenuous
than any other group's first day at an academy.
   ``There was strenuous physical activities, as there always was
on that first day ... (but) we have found no one that was denied
water upon request,'' Egan said at a news conference.
   The most seriously ill cadet, Timothy Shepard, 25, a Pittsfield
police trainee, collapsed while running on the track and has been
in a coma for a week.
   He received a liver transplant early Tuesday at
Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh and remained in
critical condition.
   Mike Purcell of Northampton, who quit the Edward J. Connelly
Criminal Justice Training Center after one day, said recruits were
required to exercise vigorously and were kept moving with pushups
and laps if they failed to respond quickly to orders.
   ``We started at 7:30 a.m. with a formation with our gear _ our
jackets, boots and other stuff in a duffel bag weighing 50 to 60
pounds _ and we had to walk to classes carrying the duffel bag
above our heads with one arm,'' he said.
   ``We also moved metal lockers and heavy wood furniture from the
basement up to either the second or third floor of the building,''
he said. ``Everybody was pushed to the limit before we even got to
the physical training part.''
   George F. Grady, the state's chief epidemiologist, said the
cadets who became ill at the training facility in Agawam suffered
from dehydration and exhaustion.
   Law enforcement officials said they would investigate training
routines at Massachusetts police academies.
   Nearly three dozen police chiefs from western Massachusetts have
asked the state attorney general to have an independent agency
investigate the academy.
   John P. McHugh, chairman of the training council, said the
council, the state attorney's general office and state police would
investigate training procedures in the academies.
   ``Hopefully the council's mission will be to correct this so it
won't occur in the future,'' McHugh said.
   But Grady said, ``We feel at this time that the cause of illness
was a relatively insufficient intake of water relative to the
amount of exercise they were doing.''
   The Executive Office of Public Safety oversees the council,
which certifies the state's 12 police academies. Egan said that
``stressful situations'' are often introduced as part of the
training to see if any of the cadets may react improperly.
   ``We'd rather have them do it in the academy than out in the
streets,'' Egan said.
   Asked if it was the cadets who were at fault for not drinking
enough water, Egan replied, ``Some of them were unaware of the fact
that they were doing damage to themselves. They had a chance to go
home every night to rehydrate.''
   Several stricken cadets told reporters that they could not
comment on their experiences at the training facility without
permission from their supervisors. But one former cadet said the
training routine was severe and that trainees were allowed only two
cups of water before Shepard collapsed.
   ``I've been through basic training in the Army and it was twice
as bad as that,'' said Purcell. ``The doctors told me that if I had
gone back for a second day, I could have suffered permanent kidney
damage.''
   A spokesman at the Baystate Medical Center Springfield hospital
said that Shepard also suffered kidney problems and several of the
other cadets received kidney dialysis treatment. Six remained
hospitalized.
   After cadets were urged to seek medical examinations, 21 were
found to exhibit symptoms from fatigue and nausea to kidney failure.
   Dr. Constance Lentz of the University of Massachusetts in
Amherst said Tuesday that she treated three to eight Holyoke cadets
suffering from fatigue and kidney problems after their first day at
the academy in 1984.
   ``I wish in retrospect that I had pushed harder for them to
protest the severity of their training,'' she said.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen told Michigan business leaders
Tuesday that with Republican George Bush at the helm, the American
economy would sail into ``the Bermuda Triangle of debt, deficit and
dependence.''
   The Democratic vice presidential candidate said he and Michael
Dukakis were tough, experienced economic managers who would tackle
U.S. trade and budget deficits and _ unlike Bush _ would strictly
enforce the new trade law aimed at opening up foreign markets to
American products.
   The Texas senator began a four-day campaign swing with a visit
to this key industrial state, where public opinion polls have shown
a close race between Bush and Dukakis with 20 electoral votes at
stake.
   ``Mike Dukakis and I both have a long record of success when it
comes to dealing with the economy,'' Bentsen told the Detroit
Economic Club.
   ``Mike took a state that was an economic basket case and turned
it around. ... As a businessman, as a senator and as chairman of
the Finance Committee I have made it a point to look for honest,
bipartisan effective answers to America's economic problems.''
   He touted Dukakis' call for expanded public-private partnerships
and said promised an activist Democratic president willing to
listen closely to the needs of business and industry.
   By contrast, he said, the Reagan-Bush administration has stood
idly while the United States lost its edge in research and
development of new products and deficits piled up, leaving the
nation reliant on foreign bankers to finance its debt.
   From Detroit, Bentsen went to Kansas City, Mo., where he
criticized Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle for
leading the unsuccessful opposition to a law giving workers 60
days' notice before they are laid off.
   ``But Dan Quayle lost the fight against plant closing and the
American people won,'' Bentsen told an airport crowd of about 250.
``We're going to open the Quayle season a little early this year.''
   Bentsen also applauded Dukakis' performance in his Sunday debate
with George Bush.
   ``He finally got George Bush out of that flag factory and
talking about the issues,'' he said.
   Bentsen was spending the remainder of night preparing for the
debate next week in Omaha, Neb. He had several briefing books with
him.
   Bentsen told the Detroit business leaders that since President
Reagan took office eight years ago, the federal budget deficit has
nearly tripled, the trade defict has grown to nearly a
half-trillion dollars and the United States has been transformed
from the largest lending nation to the largest debtor nation.
   ``Those are the facts and as President Reagan has suggested,
facts are stubborn things,'' Bentsen said. ``To me and to Mike
Dukakis, the facts suggest that staying the course, putting this
country on automatic pilot, is not an acceptable thing. Not when
the course leads to the Bermuda Triangle of debt, deficit and
dependence.''
   He said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter has been
``putting out the word that if George Bush wins this election you
won't see any change, they're not going to provide rigorous
enforcement of that trade bill ...''
   Said Bentsen: ``That would be a disaster for America _ and no
city knows it better than Detroit.''
   Tailoring part of his speech to blue-collar workers, Bentsen
said income in Michigan has grown slower than the national average
and domestic car production has fallen during the economic recovery
that Reagan brags about.
   Bentsen is to visit President Truman's birthplace at
Independence, Mo., on Wednesday and deliver a speech that aides
said would compare his credentials for the vice presidency with
those of Quayle, 41, an Indiana senator.

   The ``squirrel vote'' has become a
consideration in the five-candidate campaign for the U.S. House of

Congressional District.
   Saturday's election coincides with the opening of Louisiana's

<TEXT>
   Hospital authorities on
Tuesday reported the first three deaths of Palestinians from the
army's newly introduced plastic bullets, which have stirred
controversy and drawn a U.N. protest.
   The army confirmed the deaths, all in the Gaza Strip, but said
in all three cases it still was checking to determine the cause of
death.
   The Palestinian hospital officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity for fear of retribution, have proven reliable in the past
in providing information on Palestinian casualties.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Tuesday defended plastic
bullets as a useful tool in dealing with violence in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip and acknowledged they could increase
casualties.
   ``The plastic bullet is intended to hit stone throwers,
organizers and inciters of demonstrations, outside the range of the
rock,'' Rabin told a news conference at a military camp in Beit El,
about 12 miles north of Jerusalem.
   ``The fact that there are more casualties among the rioters for
the same number of disturbances _ that is exactly our aim.''
   Rabin's comments indicated a change in the army's firing rules.
Soldiers previously could not fire tear gas and rubber bullets at
protesters unless their lives were threatened. In a
life-threatening situation, the soldiers could use regular lead
bullets.
   These were the deaths blamed by hospital officials on plastic
bullets:
   _Osama Braikah, 17, of Gaza's Khan Yunis refugee camp, died
after a plastic bullet pierced his heart Tuesday during a clash
with troops in the camp, said an official at nearby Nasser Hospital.
   An army official confirmed the death but said he did not know if
a plastic bullet was the cause. He acknowledged plastic bullets
were used to break up a stone-throwing mob Tuesday at Khan Yunis.
   _Aiman Abu Sharar, 17, died in Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp
after soldiers shot him in the chest Tuesday with a plastic bullet,
hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed the death and said plastic bullets were
probably used in Nuseirat, but that it could not give the exact
cause of death.
   _Jihad Zanoun, 27, of Gaza City, died Monday after he was hit in
the chest by a plastic bullet, doctors at Shifa Hospital said.
   The army confirmed Zanoun's death and said it was checking
whether he was shot by a plastic or a standard lead bullet.
   A fourth shooting death was reported Tuesday, but officials
could not say whether Hussam Gharbawi died from a plastic bullet or
lead bullet. Gharbawi was wounded in clashes in Gaza Monday and
died Tuesday in Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv, the army and
Arab reports said.
   The deaths raised to 278 the number of Palestinians killed since
their uprising began on Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died.
   On Tuesday, at least 26 Palestinians were wounded in clashes
with Israeli troops in the occupied lands, hospitals reported.
   The army said two injuries were confirmed and other reports were
being checked.
   The latest casualties followed an upsurge of violence in the
occupied lands Monday that left two other Palestinians dead and at
least 67 wounded. The violence accompanied a general strike in the
territories to protest Israeli imprisonment of Palestinians. Israel
took the territories from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   The plastic bullet has greater range and impact than rubber. Its
introduction last month sent Arab casualties soaring and drew calls
for limiting its use.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which aids Palestinian
refugees, protested to the army, noting that woundings in the Gaza
Strip alone jumped from 19 in July to 130 in the first 25 days of
September.
   A senior U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
casualties ``have risen to an unacceptable level'' and that growing
use of plastic and lead bullets ``cannot be justified.''
   Rabin said his job was to reduce violence _ ``Other protests,
with all due respects, are of secondary importance to me.''
   Israel television said snipers fired plastic bullets after
troops first fired in the air. ``In several cases, the use of
plastic bullets in an improper manner and against the orders has
caused fatalities,'' it said, without elaborating.
   An army spokesman said standing orders were that plastic bullets
were fired only by specially trained officers and aimed at the
legs, but he could not confirm the procedure was fulfilled in every
case.
   Dr. Elias Artin of Gaza City's Ahli Arab Hospital said in an
interview that plastic bullets tended to do less damage than lead
bullets but could kill.
   ``They can kill if they hit the chest, abdomen or neck,'' he
said. ``If they hit a nerve, they can paralyze.''
   He said he treated several patients with wounds to the central
body. ``One patient took six plastic bullets, one in the abdomen,''
Artin said.

   Four advocates for homeless rights were
arrested Tuesday night when they refused to leave the Capitol Hill
office of Rep. Joseph Kennedy.
   The two men and two women, charged with unlawful entry, were
among eight Boston homeless-rights advocates who staged an all-day
sit-in at the Massachusetts Democrat's office in an attempt to
force the congressman to endorse a $20 billion housing bill.
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., would provide
7.5 million units of affordable housing. It rivals Kennedy's
proposed Community Housing Partnership Act, which would allocate
$500 million in federal matching funds to non-profit affordable
housing projects.
   After meeting with Kennedy in his office, eight demonstrators
said they would stay put until the congressman pledged to support
Frank's bill.
   The group had been protesting inside Kennedy's office since 11
a.m. and four refused to leave when asked by the congressman's
staff, said Capitol police officer Dan Nichols.
   Nichols said they are scheduled to be arraigned in D.C. Superior
Court on Wednesday. They face a possible $500 fine and@or up to six
months in prison.
   Jim Stewart, an organizer for the protesters, had said earlier
the group of constituents, four of whom are homeless, traveled to
the Capitol in hopes of ``putting momentum behind the Frank bill''
by lobbying members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation.
   ``The least we can do is risk arrest here until we convince Joe
it's the right thing to do,'' he said, adding that Kennedy's
housing bill is ``inadequate to the need'' of the homeless.
   Aides to Kennedy, who is a member of the housing and community
development subcommittee, said the congressman has reservations
about the Frank bill because it is too expensive and does not
clearly spell out how the money is to be used.
   ``Joe just feels there's a better bill out there,'' said Chuck
McDermott, a Kennedy aide, adding that Kennedy also supports other
measures that would provide for construction and rehabilitation of
public housing.

   A new NASA launch directorate met
Tuesday to clear the shuttle Discovery for its Thursday liftoff,
hearing an ``excellent review'' of the $1.5 billion spacecraft's
readiness _ but holding off giving a go-ahead for the final
countdown.
   ``In general, the whole picture is very good for going flying
the day after tomorrow,'' said former astronaut Robert Crippen, who
heads the launch oversight panel created to overcome management
problems that contributed to the 1986 Challenger disaster.
   Crippen said the group was focusing on two items and needed to
be certain neither would imperil NASA's first manned mission in 32
months.
   Launch is scheduled for 9:59 a.m. EDT on Thursday, with the
final countdown to begin early Wednesday evening. ``The weather is
probably the biggest question mark,'' said Crippen.
   Cloud-covered skies and Atlantic winds loomed, as always, as a
possible threat. Air Force spokesman Mike Beeman forecast ``a 20
percent probability of bad weather at launch time,'' but added,
``That's pretty low.'' Historically, launches have been delayed 40
percent of the time because of weather.
   The outlook didn't brighten much late in the day. Weathermen
still were predicting widely scattered showers in the area.
   Discovery's five astronauts went over their flight plan and
relaxed with their wives as the ship sat surrounded by work
platforms on launch pad 39B. Heat shields, removed for engine
check-out, were back in place and engineers checked guidance and
navigation systems. Inside the cargo bay: the Tracking and Data
Relay Satellite (TDRS) to be placed in orbit just six hours after
launch. A similar satellite was destroyed in the Challenger
catastrophe.
   One of the hardware items still in question was an O-ring in the
satellite propulsion system. The other involved a small jet
thruster aboard the orbiter itself _ a component that could be
bypassed if need be.
   The $100 million data-relay satellite had already been approved
for flight when NASA discovered a problem with similar hardware
being prepared for flight next February.
   Crippen said an examination of the inertial upper stage (IUS)
rocket that boosts the satellite to its final orbit indicated
damage in the O-ring that seals the pressure needed to gain thrust
for orbit. (The O-ring is not the same part that failed in leading
to the 1986 Challenger disaster.)
   NASA needed to be certain the flaw was not replicated aboard
Discovery, Crippen said. Air Force Col. Dennis E. Beebe said
experts believed the O-ring was ``damaged as part of the
installation procedures,'' and so the problem would not also exist
on the satellite aboard Discovery.
   Crippen said the shuttle cargo bay would not be opened for
inspection of the satellite, but that propulsion experts would
conduct tests overnight on other such rockets to make sure they
don't leak.
   ``You have heard they have a great deal of confidence they'll be
able to come in and tell us tomorrow that they think they are
prepared to fly,'' Crippen said.
   The report was due at another meeting of the oversight team at
10 a.m.
   Delivery of the satellite is Discovery's main mission in NASA's
long-awaited return to space, and the space agency would not likely
launch without being sure there was no problem.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since Jan. 28, 1986, when a
booster rocket failure destroyed Challenger and took the lives of
seven astronauts. Many NASA workers were wearing green ribbons on
their workclothes this week to signify their hopes for a safe
liftoff and successful mission.
   A ``lightning alert'' delayed the final preparation of
Discovery's power-producing fuel cells Tuesday morning, but the
countdown was not affected. The countdown was to enter a 19-hour
hold at midnight, a cushion that gives NASA time for testing the
satellite O-ring.
   Commander Frederick H. Hauck and pilot Richard O. Covey were up
at dawn Tuesday, practicing landings on the Kennedy Space Center
runway in an aircraft that handles like a shuttle. The three-mile
runway would be used if a launching problem forced the shuttle to
return home.
   At the Launch Control Center, engineers were checking electronic
readings from the ship, 4.2 miles distant. At 1:40 a.m. EDT
Thursday, a half-million gallons of super-cold fuel will pour into
the shuttle's tanks, aiming for the nationally televised liftoff.
   The 21-person launch oversight team consists of top officials
from each of 17 units responsible for shuttle procedures or
components. In their first meeting ever, they gathered Tuesday to
air any problems that might surface. The Rogers Commission, which
investigated the Challenger accident, found that engineers'
opposition to launching in cold weather never reached the ears of
key NASA launch officials.
   Crippen, one of several former astronauts who have moved into
key shuttle management posts since the accident, heads the unit and
has sole authority to stop a launch. The launch directorate is on
call all through the final 48 hours.
   Hauck, Covey and mission specialists George D. Nelson, David C.
Hilmers and John M. Lounge reviewed countdown and flight procedures
and underwent physical examinations. They also received a weather
briefing.
   NASA's rules, tightened since Challenger, forbid launching when
there is lightning or rain within 10 miles of the pad. Winds of
more than 17 knots (about 20 mph) from the south or 24 knots (28
mph) from any direction would automatically scrub the liftoff.

   Panama's acting president, Manuel Solis
Palma, told the General Assembly Tuesday that U.S. drug charges
against Gen. Manuel Noriega are false and part of a U.S. attempt to
extend its control of the Panama Canal.
   Solis Palma said Panama was waging a battle against narcotics
traffickers. Noriega and Panama were victims of a U.S. propaganda
war that could turn into armed conflict, he declared.
   Ambassador Vernon A. Walters, the chief U.S. representative to
the United Nations, described Solis Palma's allegations as lies
``against the United States by Gen. Noriega's hand-picked chief of
state.''
   Noriega, head of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces, is
considered the real power behind the civilian government headed by
Solis Palma.
   In Panama, a government official said 26 activists arrested last
week were planning to overthrow Noriega under a U.S.-devised plot.
   The Noriega-controlled National Assembly named Solis Palma as
Panama's chief executive in February, after ousting President Eric
Arturo Devalle. The United States still recognizes Devalle as
president.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida last February on federal drug
trafficking charges and Devalle attempted to fire him. Noriega
denies wrongdoing.
   Solis Palma told the General Assembly, ``I say that the whole
campaign ... is nothing other than a sinister tissue of lies and
falsehoods carried out by the United States government.''
   The purpose of the attack is to overthrow the government and
impose another ``committed to renegotiation'' of the Panama Canal
treaty, he said.
   Under provisions of that treaty, the United States agreed to
relinquish operational control over the canal on Dec. 31, 1999.
   The United States has frozen millions of dollars in Panamanian
assets and witheld millions of dollars more in aid to force Noriega
from power.
   Solis Palma warned that hostile U.S. economic moves might turn
into war.
   ``My government has more than enough reason to fear direct
military aggression by the United States against Panama,'' he said.
   Walters denied charges of impending invasion and said Panama
``was already a seriously troubled economy.''
   Walters said he stayed away from Solis Palma's speech to
emphasize that the United States does not recognize him as
president.
   Col. Guillermo Wong, head of the Panamnian army's G-2
intelligence unit, presented a six-page document to reporters in
Panama City on Monday which he said security agents discovered
while arresting 26 opposition activists.
   He said the document, which urged making contacts with
dissidents and releasing anti-Noriega propaganda, was written by
U.S. officials and proved U.S. involvement in efforts to oust
Noriega.
   Terrence Kneebone, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Panama City,
dismissed the allegation as ``absurd'' and said it was designed
``to divert attention from Panama's political problems.''

   Marines who were called
in to help fight fires in Yellowstone National Park this summer
began leaving Tuesday, and officials expressed concern that gusting
winds might whip flames across containment lines.
   An approaching cold front increased wind speeds at the park
Tuesday afternoon.
   ``With the winds, there's always concerns about fire activity,''
said park spokeswoman Sandy Robinson.
   One area on the 107,500-acre Wolf Lake fire that firefighters
worried about was along the western edge of the Grand Canyon of the
Yellowstone.
   ``They're watching for spots on the other side because the
eastern slope of the canyon is heavily timbered,'' said Robinson.
``So they obviously do not want the fire in that area because of
the potential for spreading.''
   Elsewhere in Yellowstone, little activity was reported on the
400,100-acre North Fork fire that earlier this month swept around
the Old Faithful Geyser complex. Although fire managers were
concerned about the strong winds, they said higher humidity levels
would help keep the flames in check.
   ``There were a few hot spots in the Mary Lake area, and they had
firefighters camping out last night at spike camps,'' said
Robinson. ``But today all firefighters have been brought into the
base camps because of the wind and cold weather.''
   Still, conditions improved enough in the past few days to allow
640 Marines to pack up their gear for the return trip to California.
   About 500 civilian firefighters remained.
   Officials estimate that since the fires began, as much as 60
percent of an area covering more than 1.6 million acres of
Yellowstone and surrounding national forests has been burned.
   To the east of Yellowstone in the Shoshone National Forest,
firefighters were attacking a section of the 413,410-acre
Clover-Mist fire that Monday had slopped over the border into
Montana.
   ``They've pulled most of the crews from the mop-up effort
(elsewhere on the Clover-Mist) to try to corral that fire,'' said
spokesman Tom Mitchell.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze said Tuesday that the pullout of more than 100,000 Red
Army troops from Afghanistan has been suspended because of alleged
violations of a U.N.-negotiated accord.
   In a speech earlier Tuesday to the 43rd General Assembly,
Shevardnadze proposed that the five permanent members of the
Security Council meet to discuss violations of the withdrawal
agreement.
   ``As soon as Soviet troops began to withdraw, a non-stop
production line of violations was set in motion,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze later told reporters the Soviets have suspended
their pullout.
   ``We have completed the first stage of our withdrawal,'' he
said, speaking through a translator in a U.N. building hallway.
   ``We have not yet begun the second stage of withdrawal. Let's
wait and see, and I raised several question in my speech today. It
is necessary to stop the violations that take place. It is the most
important thing,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union has filed numerous complaints to the United
Nations alleging that Pakistan is allowing U.S.-backed guerrillas
to continue launching raids into Afghanistan from bases in Pakistan.
   ``This cannot be allowed to happen. The chain of conflict
settlement generated by Afghanistan must not be allowed to break,''
Shevardnadze said.
   ``We're not complaining to anyone. We have the means to make
things fall into place. But we are responsible to the United
Nations, and therefore are appealing to it,'' he said.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to replace
one Marxist government with another. The United States has supplied
arms to Moslem troops fighting the Marxist government of President
Najib.
   Under the accords signed April 14 in Geneva, the Soviet Union
agreed to withdraw half of its 100,000 troops from Afghanistan by
Aug. 15 and the remainder by Feb. 15, 1989.
   The agreement was signed by the Soviet Union, the United States,
Pakistan and the Afghan government. The guerrillas were not party
to the talks.
   Under the accord, Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed not to
interfere in each others' internal affairs. Pakistan has denied
aiding the guerrillas.
   Shevardnadze said Pakistan and Afghanistan should be invited to
the proposed Security Council meeting.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz told a news conference in
New York Tuesday that the Security Council could meet Friday to
discuss violations of the Geneva accords, but that the United
States does not recognize the Afghan government.
   He asked the Afghan government to cease its violations of
Pakistan's air space with war plane overfights and air raids on
guerrilla camps.
   The five permanent Security Council members are the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China.
   Spokesmen for the secretary-general's office have declined
comment on previous complaints by Afghanistan, Pakistan and the
Soviet Union about each other's compliance with the accords.

<HEAD>Charges Filed Against Man Claiming Mouse In Beer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state has filed product tampering
and extortion charges against an unemployed construction worker who
claimed he found a 6-inch-long decomposed mouse in a can of Coors
beer.
   James Harvey, 30, claimed he found the mouse July 27. Harvey,
who sought between $30,000 and $50,000 from the brewery as
compensation, refused a $1,500 offer from The Adolph Coors Co. for
the can and the mouse.
   Separate court-ordered studies at the University of Florida and
Coors headquarters in Golden, Colo., including an examination of
the dead mouse, concluded the animal was placed inside the 16-ounce
can after it left the brewery in May.
   ``We're alleging extortion,'' said McRae. ``It certainly had to
do with allegations of communications with The Adolph Coors Co. to
seek $35,000 out of this transaction.''
   Assistant State Attorney E. McRae Mathis said the Coors case is
similar to the Tylenol-tampering case a few years ago in terms of
public reaction.
   He added that the case may be the first filed under a statute
passed in July 1987 that strengthened penalties for tampering with
a product to injure a person or company.
   McRae said Coors officials reported a 16 percent loss of sales
nationwide since news reports about Harvey's allegations. Coors
spokesman David Goldberg said Tuesday that the figure was lower but
would not give an exact number.
   Authorities believe Harvey has left Florida, but Duval Circuit
Judge R. Hudson Olliff set bond of $50,000.
   Harvey could face up to 15 years in prison for each of the
second-degree felony charges if convicted.
   The beer company would not comment, but earlier this month,
Coors filed a civil lawsuit in Duval Circuit Court accusing Harvey
of fraud and deceit, product disparagement, defamation and
attempted theft by deception. No specific cash amount was named.

   The first U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker to
sail without a close escort of U.S. warships left Kuwait Tuesday,
heading south through waters where three mines have been discovered
in the past five days.
   Although traveling alone, the 81,283-ton oil products carrier
Surf City would not be unprotected should trouble arise, U.S.
military sources said.
   ``She's on her way, and will be under surveillance at all
times,'' said one source, insisting on anonymity. Attacks on
commercial shipping stopped Aug. 20 when Iran and Iraq declared a
cease-fire in their 8-year-old war.
   However, fears of mines were heightened with reports that
Italian mine-hunters found an explosive device floating in the
south-central Persian Gulf _ the third such discovery in five days
and the fifth since Aug. 19.
   Iran is considered responsible for virtually all gulf mines.
   Iran's navy commander said Tuesday that Iran's territorial
waters in the northern gulf are cleared of mines, as are major
parts of the international waters, the official Islamic Republic
news agency reported in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   IRNA quoted Rear Adm. Mohammed-Hussein Malekzadegan as saying an
Iranian warship and two guided missile boats arrived in the
northern gulf ports of Imam Khomeini and Mahshahr after clearing
the shipping channels in Khur Musa of mines. Khur Musa is the
extended bay leading to the two ports.
   U.S. naval experts estimate that about 200 mines remain in the
gulf.
   U.S. warships were to monitor the Surf City's two-day passage
from patrol stations along the 550-mile track through the gulf and
the Strait of Hormuz.
   The missile frigate USS Vandegrift trailed the tanker at a
distance, but for the first time no warship was sailing in ``close
convoy'' with it, the sources said.
   The unescorted voyage reflected President Reagan's decision,
announced Monday, to scale back the Navy's role in the escort
program.
   The close-quarter convoy operation formally ended Monday, when
the USS Vandegrift delivered the 294,739-ton supertanker Townsend
to Kuwait after escorting it through the gulf.
   That movement was the 67th this year and the 89th since July
1987, when Washington agreed to reflag 11 Kuwait-owned tankers to
protect them from Iranian attack.
   U.S. officials say its first ocean convoy operation since World
War II proved successful by assuring the export of billions of
barrels of Kuwaiti petroleum products.
   Some U.S. diplomats and officials say it also forestalled Soviet
efforts to gain greater influence in the waterway that provides
nearly 20 percent of the non-communist world's petroleum.
   Kuwait's support for Iraq made its shipping a special target of
Iranian gunboats during attacks. The White House said reduced
tensions made possible the Navy's reduced role.
   Administration officials say the new policy might allow the
withdrawal of one ship. The 26-member fleet now includes 16 in the
gulf and a carrier battle group in the Arabian Sea.
   The missile cruiser USS Vincennes was withdrawn earlier this
month and was not replaced.
   The Pentagon also has curtailed air patrols and other escort
activities. That cost had been estimated by U.S. officials at $20
million a month.
   Nine Americans were killed in helicopter and jet crashes during
the operation.
   Other incidents included the mining of the supertanker Bridgeton
in the first convoy July 24, 1987, an Iranian Silkworm missile
attack that disabled the tanker Sea Isle City at Kuwait, and the
near-sinking of the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts by a mine April
14.
   The U.S. forces retaliated, wrecking two oil platforms and
sinking or damaging six Iranian naval craft in an attack April 18.
   On July 3, the Vincennes mistook an Iranian jetliner for an
attacking military jet and shot it down, killing all 290 aboard.

   A six-story apartment building on a
steep hillside collapsed Tuesday, killing a man and his baby son
and leaving at least four people trapped in the rubble, officials
said.
   Authorities said the building may have been weakened by
Hurricane Gilbert, which hit this northern industrial city on Sept.
17 and caused widespread flooding that killed at least 140 people
in the area.
   At least four people were rescued after the collapse, said state
prosecutor Alejandro Garza Garza.
   A woman, her clothes torn and covered with blood, was pulled
from the debris. She told rescuers someone else was trapped there.
As she was carried away on a wooden stretcher a man ran up, took
off his shirt and said: ``Here my daughter, take this.''
   Juan Francisco Rivera, the attorney general of Nuevo Leon state,
identified the woman as Maria Eugenia Gonzalez de Rodriguez, about
26, wife of the man who died and mother of the dead baby.
   Rivera said at least four people were believed still inside the
building. Earlier, he said five people were believed trapped, but
officials later determined that the sixth floor had been empty when
the building collapsed.
   Rivera reported that he called off all but 10 of the 100
rescuers at 1:30 p.m. because of dangerously shifting rubble.
   ``The movement could be dangerous for those who are alive,''
Rivera said. ``We are trying to approach it more technically.''
   Garza identified the dead man as Antonio Rodriguez, 25 to 30
years old, and said he did not know the name of the baby boy.
   The lower floors of the 3-year-old building pancaked atop one
another but the top three levels slid about 250 feet down the
hillside. The rubble stood about one story high, with mattresses,
clothing, furniture and crushed air conditioners half buried.
   The building, in a wealthy area of the city, was one of the
highest structures in Monterrey.
   Francisco Javier Nakashima, an investigator with the state
judicial police, said heavy rains from Hurricane Gilbert must have
contributed to the collapse. He said the structure was reported
leaning to one side six months ago.
   Ruben Salinas Garcia, 27, who was in his second floor apartment
at the time, said he didn't realize what was happening until the
building was falling.
   ``I woke up and the roof was on top of me,'' he said at the
scene. He said his maid apparently still was trapped inside the
builidng.
   His face and pink T-shirt were covered with blood and a bandage
covered his chin.

<HEAD>Former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Dead at 61</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William V. Shannon, a journalist and college
professor who served as U.S. ambassador to Ireland under President
Carter, died Tuesday of cancer. He was 61.
   ``His experience in foreign affairs and as a journalist and
writer and editorial writer for The New York Times brought not only
a vast experience, but a very high level of achievement to bear in
his classes,'' said Boston University President John Silber. ``He
was an inspiration to our students, a stimulation to our colleagues
and a productive and witty colleague. The loss to the university is
very great.''
   Shannon taught a course on the American presidency and conducted
graduate seminars in journalism upon his return from Ireland in
early 1981.
   He also was a regular contributing columnist to The Boston Globe
on various topics, foreign and domestic.
   Before Carter appointed him ambassador, Shannon had spent
1964-1977 as an editorial writer with the Times. Before that, he
was a reporter for the New York Post and received the New York
Newspaper Guild's Page 1 Award for his coverage of the
Army-McCarthy congressional hearings in 1954.
   His books include ``The American Irish,'' a history of
immigration from Ireland to the United States; ``They Could Not
Trust The King,'' an account of the Watergate hearings; and ``Our
Soverign State'' and the best-selling ``The Truman
Merry-Go-Round,'' both written with co-author Robert S. Allen.
   Born in Worcester, the son of immigrants from County Clare,
Ireland, Shannon graduated magna cum laude from Clark University in
1947 at the age of 19 and earned a master's degree in American
History at Harvard University the next year.
   Shannon is survived by his wife, three sons and other family
members.

<HEAD>Immigrant Gang Members Robbing Neighborhood Homes and Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young Vietnamese immigrants robbing homes and
businesses are part of a growing wave of gang violence up and down
the Pacific Coast, authorities say.
   One gang police broke up last year had robbed as many as 50
Vietnamese families, and even more violent groups have since
emerged, Detective Jim Bryan said.
   ``These are brand-new, newly identified, never-before-heard-of
Vietnamese gangs. It's going to be a continuing problem,'' Bryan
said. ``It's the same thing as last year, but they're getting more
violent now. They're pistol-whipping people.''
   The Vietnamese gangs are emerging at a time when Los Angeles
authorities already have a full-time war on their hands against
well-established Hispanic and black gangs.
   Gang violence over the weekend claimed the lives of four people
and left seven others wounded, including two pregnant women.
   The Vietnamese robbers range in age from 15 to 25 and usually
are either runaways or juvenile parolees or delinquents on
probation, Bryan said.
   In a June 23 Vietnamese gang attack, 30-year-old Thang Vo
survived several gunshot wounds. His assailant and three other
robbers tied up a wounded Vo, his wife, brother-in-law and a family
friend, while Vo's three young children were left untied.
   The robbers, known to police as ``Dracula's Group,'' then sat
down to eat lunch in Vo's kitchen.
   ``They ate lunch while (Vo) was lying there bleeding,'' Bryan
said. ``He's lucky he lived.''
   Another Los Angeles-based group of Vietnamese immigrants is
suspected of committing at least a dozen robberies, from here to
Portland, Ore., and Seattle, police said.
   ``We've got so much activity with these guys now that it's hard
to even track it anymore,'' said Portland police officer David
Hauck.
   A continuing problem in Portland is a reluctance of victims to
report crimes out of fear of retaliation, Hauck said.

   State health officials declared
Tuesday that it is safe for hundreds of former residents to return
to Love Canal, the neighborhood that became world famous for
chemical contamination.
   State Health Commissioner Dr. David Axelrod said most areas of
Love Canal contain no more chemicals than other neighborhoods in
the industrial city.
   The long-awaited finding was hailed by Love Canal residents who
feared that the neighborhood would not be resettled but would be
left vacant as a symbol of environmental disaster.
   ``We've been waiting for this for 10 years,'' said Nunzio
LoVerdi, who lived in a housing project in Love Canal. ``I'll be
the first to move back.''
   Former resident Lois Gibbs, who heads a Washington-based
environmental group, pointed out, however, that the state had not
removed all the chemicals dumped in the area in the 1940s, but had
merely contained the hazard and cleaned up some residential areas.
   As part of the state ruling, a task force of local officials
will create a plan to resettle the community and assist homeowners
in renovating their homes, many of which have fallen into disrepair.
   Hundreds of families had been awaiting the decision to determine
whether they can return to the homes they left 10 years ago when
President Jimmy Carter declared the area a national disastr. As
many as 80 other families were hoping the study would confirm their
decision to stay in their homes near the former chemical dumpsite.
   Niagara Falls Mayor Michael O'Laughlin said the decision will be
good for the city.
   ``It won't mean a landslide of people moving back,'' O'Laughlin
said. ``But it will mean the city will begin to put the nightmare
behind it.''
   Axelrod met with some 200 residents of the area Tuesday night to
announce his findings.
   At first, residents were angry and frustrated at not being able
understand Axelrod's technical presentation. But the mood lightened
as it became clear that most residents were getting good news.
Axelrod recommended, however, that some blocks were still unsafe,
affecting about 10 families.
   ``I won't move. He can just forget it,'' said one of the
residents, Kathy Atkins. She said her home had been tested before
and found to be free of chemicals.
   Axelrod said some homes in areas deemed unsafe may have been
found to be free of high levels of contamination, but residents
still should move because the surrounding areas had higher
concentrations of chemicals.
   Peter Slocum, spokesman for the state Health Department, said
that people such as Atkins may be allowed to move into other homes
in the neighborhood.
   The go-ahead for resettlement will add to a revitalization under
way in the area.
   Phyllis Festor, president of the Niagara Falls Board of
Realtors, said the city is having a real estate boom.
   ``The decision has been so long in coming that, for most people,
it doesn't matter anymore,'' Ms. Festor said.
   Home prices in the Love Canal area have risen in each of the
last three years from an average of $35,000 to $40,000, she said.
   Ms. Festor, who lives two blocks from Love Canal, said people
aren't frightened by the prospect of living near the site. ``It's a
secure area with nice homes that are just right for people starting
out,'' she said.
   Love Canal, an abandoned waterway project, was used by the
Hooker Chemical Co. to dispose of thousand of pounds of chemical
wastes in the 1940s. The company made herbicides and pesticides.
   In the 1950s, the canal and its contents were covered over and
homes and an elementary school built. It wasn't until the early
1970s that people began to notice foul smells in their basements
and oily puddles in their yards.
   They also began to notice higher-than-usual incidences of
miscarriages, birth defects, cancer, leukemia, neurological
disease, allergies, epilepsy and suicide.
   In all, 728 homes in a 50-block area were evacuated and the
elementary school and 228 houses torn down.
   The state and federal government filed multimillion-dollar suits
against the company's parent, Occidental Chemical Corp. Much of
that litigation is still pending.
   The dumpsite has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and
plastic liners to prevent the chemicals from leaking into the air
or groundwater. Corroding drums of chemicals have been separated
and complex runoff and monitoring systems built.
   Most homes in the immediate area of the dumpsite are boarded up
and decaying.

   A politically minded pilot crash-landed a
small plane in Golden Gate Park on Tuesday, a short time after
radical pamphlets were dropped from a plane buzzing San Quentin
Prison, officials said.
   ``I've got political news: There's more people to vote for than
just (presidential candidates Michael) Dukakis and (George) Bush,''
said student pilot Allen Dale, as police took him into custody.
   Police did not say if Dale was licensed to fly solo.
   Dale, 40, of San Francisco was arrested for investigation of
stealing the single-engine Bellanca Citavria from Palo Alto Airport
as he tried to run away from the crash site with a backpack full of
revolutionary tracts, police reported.
   The airplane, which had the name ``Nasty Nancy'' and anti-Reagan
administration slogans painted on it, was not damaged except for a
bent propeller, said Officer Barry Cooper.
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators examined the plane
and found that it had fuel in it and no apparent engine defects.
   ``It kind of points to the fact he did it on purpose,'' said FAA
spokesman John Evans.
   A small plane dropped radical pamphlets as it flew over San
Quentin about 10:15 a.m., said prison Lt. Cal White.
   The same plane is believed to have then buzzed the
Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco, just two miles from the
landing site, police said.
   No one was injured in the landing about 10:15 a.m. at the park's
Polo Field, where gardeners were working and joggers were making
their morning runs.
   Palo Alto police said the plane had been reported stolen earlier
in the day from the West Valley Flying Club, said San Francisco
police Sgt. Jerry Senkir.
   The plane, the type that normally is used for acrobatic
purposes, was registered to Burt and Evelyn Johnson of Berkeley,
according to FAA records. The Johnsons did not return telephone
calls for comment.
   The pilot, carrying a backpack of revolutionary pamphlets, was
about halfway back to the Haight on foot when officers in a truck
apprehended him.
   ``It was material about wanting to get Reagan, Meese and Bush,''
police said.
   The plane also had ``The A-Team'' painted on it along with
slogans urging the release of prisoners of war from Vietnam. Skulls
wearing green berets were painted on both sides of the plane and
the words ``Pilot: Capt. Crunch'' were scrawled on one door.

   The nation's welfare system is headed for a
major overhaul with the conclusion of complex negotiations on a
five-year plan aimed at moving welfare recipients into jobs and
helping them collect more child support.
   The initiative agreed on Monday by Senate, House and White House
negotiators had been close to death all summer as negotiators
sought a balance between conservatives favoring mandatory work and
liberals concerned about increasing benefits to the needy and
motivating people to enter the mainstream workplace.
   The $3.34 billion welfare plan comes in above the Senate's own
$2.8 billion measure but would cost less than half of the initial
$7.1 billion plan passed by the House.
   The cornerstone of the compromise is a Job Opportunities and
Basic Skills (JOBS) program offering welfare parents _ including
those with preschool children _ services such as job search help,
education and job training. Child care and transportation aid would
be available to participants.

   Some 4.7 million Americans will have to wait

   Refusing to bow to GOP demands for a broad-based subminimum

$3.75 an hour in January.

   Corn and soybean harvests are proceeding at a record pace in

concerned that will accelerate the schedule of fall tilling and
other field work.
   ``There's a definite correlation between plowing or tilling in

``The best way to conserve that moisture is not to till.''

   Swedish
navy ships are constantly on the hunt for alien submarines in the
Baltic, but the intruders just as constantly elude them in a maze
of islands and underwater mountains.
   ``It's like fox hunting,'' said Cmdr. Lennart Danielsson,
skipper of this flagship for Sweden's antisubmarine warfare unit.
``You have to stretch him, to be after him all the time so that at
last he's so tired that he makes a mistake,''
   So far the fox has escaped, but the hunters say they are getting
closer.
   The navy believes that during a three-week chase in June a
prowler may have been wounded under a barrage of depth charges and
anti-submarine grenades, but the vessel slipped away.
   ``We almost managed this spring,'' said Danielsson on the bridge
of the HMS Stockholm during a training exercise. ``I think we will
get him in a couple of years.''
   The Stockholm, with a crew of 29 men and three women, spends two
weeks a month at sea, patrolling and following up some of the
hundreds of reports from citizens claiming to have seen a periscope
or a diving sub. Sometimes the invader turns out to be a frisky
seal or swimming moose.
   The antisubmarine unit can muster two corvettes, 12 submarines,
seven minelayers, 16 patrol boats and 12 helicopters _ all equipped
with the latest sonar.
   ``One or two ships is not enough against a submarine,''
Danielsson said. The tactic is to box in the intruder with sonar
signals from all directions, then close in and open fire.
   Because it has never snared an intruder, the unit has had a
credibility problem. Foreign experts have suggested the Swedes may
prefer to let the intruders go to avoid a diplomatic fuss.
Danielsson said that wasn't true.
   Sweden, which has not fought a war since 1814, dismissed the
submarine threat until 1981 when a Soviet sub ran aground near the
naval complex at Karlskrona. The incident jarred Swedes into
understanding their neutrality was no defense against foreign
military adventures.
   Experts who investigated a 1982 engagement also concluded the
other intruders were also Soviet submarines, and Sweden lodged a
diplomatic protest with Moscow. The inquiry also disclosed the
existence of previously unknown minisubs launched from conventional
submarines equipped with caterpillar tracks to crawl on the seabed.
   Re-examining previous incidents, the Swedes concluded that the
Soviets had been violating Swedish waters since the early 1960s.
   Although the navy claims many confirmed sightings of alien subs,
the Swedish government has not made any formal accusation against
any nation.
   The most recent engagement began Aug. 27 off the west coast
north of Goteborg, but the chase was abandoned after two weeks.
   The government has said it lacks the evidence to substantiate a
charge against any specific country for that incident. The Soviets
deny their ships are involved and have suggested the incursions are
imagined.
   Navy analysts believe that in wartime, the Soviet Union would
want to neutralize Swedish defenses to allow its ground and air
forces to transit Scandinavia.
   The Baltic is one of only three sea outlets on the Soviets'
western front. The others are the frigid Barents Sea north of
Sweden and Norway, and through Turkey's narrow Bosporus strait into
the Mediterranean.
   To Danielsson, a 41-year-old career officer, it doesn't matter
whether the prowlers are from the West or the Soviet bloc. His job
is to stop them.
   Danielsson said the intruders usually come in groups of six: two
conventional subs and four minisubs which can slip into the
inner-archipelago of some 24,000 islands. Often, they operate in
several squads at the same time along the coast to tax Sweden's
defense resources.
   Their mission is ``pure intelligence, to learn everything there
is to know about our coastal defenses,'' Danielsson said.
   Danielsson's 330-ton corvette is armed with artillery and depth
charges that could sink a sub, but much of its weaponry is intended
to punch holes in the hull of a sub and force it to the surface,
rather than destroy it.
   The ship bristles with the latest electronics. Its operations
room is crammed with radar, sonar and television screens like a
darkened arcade of space-age video games.
   But submarines have the advantage of the underseas terrain.
   A craggy, mountainous seabed provides camouflage along a coast
that stretches 4,750 miles.
   A strange mixture of varying water temperatures and salinity
work to deflect the hunters' sonar, and a junkyard of wrecks and
metalic rocks bounce back a confusing blizzard of sonar beeps.
   ``We have learned a lot since 1982, and the first thing we
learned was that it is much harder than we thought to catch a
sub,'' said Danielsson.
   ``He can go down to the bottom and pretend to be a rock, or he
can move away very fast,'' Danielsson said, and the normal chances
of finding him are ``less than one 1 percent.''
   The incursions are so politically sensitive that the commander
said he would not be surprised if the intruders blew themselves up
rather than surrender.
   ``These are pros, not amateurs. We will never see a submarine
coming up and waving a white flag,'' he said.

<HEAD>Philippines Senator Calls for Slow Down in Investigations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senator has called on his
congressional colleagues to slow down on investigations. The
probes, he said, often never end and keep legislators and other
officials from more useful work.
   ``I have nothing against such investigations per se,'' Sen. Rene
Saguisag said. ``But I don't think that when we were elected last
year, we would be let loose _ we, 200-plus members of Congress _ to
investigate everyone and everybody. ...
   ``Whatever is in the headlines today, tomorrow it will be
investigated.''
   He added that the communist insurgency continues and crime
increases because generals and police chiefs spend too much time
answering questions at congressional hearings.
   Saguisag made his appeal for a cutback on probes during a
television talk show discussion with Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who
took the opposite view. Just hours before the show, Enrile called
for yet another investigation, the 73rd pending before the
23-member Senate.
   The bicameral Congress reconvened last year for the first time
since it was abolished in 1972 by the now-deposed President
Ferdinand E. Marcos. Since resuming sessions, both houses have
initiated scores of probes on controversies chiefly brought out by
Manila's free-wheeling press.
   The probes involve subjects ranging from the country's $28
billion foreign debt and alleged corruption to religious cults and
whether gold bullion is buried under an old Spanish fort or if two
missing bargeloads of rice are really in the bottom of the sea.
   In early September, when a top player in the Philippines'
professional basketball league was benched for no specified reason
during a championship series, Congress launched an investigation.
   In some cases, investigations have made matters worse.
   After a recent congressional fact-finding trip to the southern
Philippines, Sen. Leticia Ramos Shahani openly accused Malaysia of
annexing six Filipino islands. Her accusation led to calls by other
legislators and officials for action just short of war.
   Mrs. Shahani later apologized, however, saying she failed to
verify an allegation made by a naval officer, who had misread a
navigational chart.
   Saguisag, a Harvard-trained lawyer, complained that in many
cases, the probes fade into oblivion after media interest wanes.
Often, investigations would never have been started if congressmen
had bothered to think twice about them, he said.
   ``I'm dumbfounded by the lack of preliminary staff work,''
Saguisag said.
   Enrile, the lone opposition member of the Senate, recently
called for investigations into alleged corruption involving
relatives of President Corazon Aquino and the sale of a lot in
California last year.
   Just before the TV show, he asked for an investigation into what
a newspaper called a list of ``economic saboteurs'' prepared by
Finance Secretary Vicente Jayme, which included unidentified
legislators.
   Enrile maintained on the show that probes were necessary to help
legislators gather information to prepare legislation. In cases of
alleged corruption involving presidential relatives, he said,
Congress should investigate because no one else will.
   Saguisag said that if investigations were unavoidable,
congressmen should be ``more restrained'' in what they say in their
sessions about other people, who might be slandered and have no
means of redress because congressmen enjoy immunity.
   Saguisag acknowledged, nevertheless, that as chairman of the
Senate's ethics committee, he himself is conducting several probes.
   Asked by program host Luis Beltran what punishment Congress can
give erring congressmen, Saguisag replied that in the 1950s, a
member of the House was suspended for 15 months because he made
false charges against the president.
   ``I am willing to be suspended for 15 months,'' Enrile said. ``I
can use it for vacation. But if I will get suspended for the error
of information I received, I expect that an equal measure will be
applied to a senator of the ruling coalition who has brought us to
the brink of war.''
   That was a reference to Mrs. Shahani and her erroneous charge
against Malaysia.

   On this date:
   In 1869, the 14th President of the United States, Franklin
Pierce, died in Concord, N.H.
   In 1918, Sgt. Alvin C. York almost single-handedly killed 25
German soldiers and captured 132 in the Argonne Forest in France.
   In 1934, Bruno Hauptmann was indicted for murder in the death of
the infant son of Charles A. Lindbergh.
   In 1944, ``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' made its debut
on CBS radio, an event that coincided with Ozzie and Harriet
Nelson's ninth wedding anniversary.
   In 1945, President Harry S. Truman announced that the secret of
the atomic bomb would be shared only with Britain and Canada.
   In 1956, Don Larsen pitched the only perfect game ever in a
World Series as the New York Yankees beat the Brooklyn Dodgers, 2-0.
   In 1957, the Brooklyn Baseball Club announced it was accepting
an offer to move the Dodgers from New York to Los Angeles.
   In 1970, exiled Soviet author Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn was
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.
   In 1981, at the White House, President Reagan greeted
predecessors Jimmy Carter, Gerald R. Ford and Richard M. Nixon
before sending them off to Egypt for the funeral of Anwar Sadat.
   In 1982, the government of Poland banned all labor
organizations, including Solidarity.
   In 1984, in an address to the United Nations General Assembly,
the president of El Salvador, Jose Napoleon Duarte, unexpectedly
offered to hold peace talks with leftist guerrillas.
   Ten years ago: Israel's Cabinet named Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman to head the Israeli
delegation that would participate in peace treaty talks with Egypt
in Washington.
   Five years ago: The Baltimore Orioles won the American League
championship, defeating the Chicago White Sox 3-0. Meanwhile, the
Philadelphia Phillies beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-2 for the
National League title.
   One year ago: U.S. helicopter gunships in the Persian Gulf sank
three Iranian patrol boats after an American observation helicopter
was fired on. (Two of six Iranian crewmen taken from the water
later died.)

<TEXT>
   Mention Liberace and many words spring to mind
before ``tasteful.''
   That, however, is exactly the word for ABC's two-hour movie
biography of the flamboyant entertainer, airing Sunday.
   ``Liberace'' is ever-so-careful with the image of the performer,
who died in February 1987 of complications from AIDS. That's due no
doubt to the fact that this production was sanctioned by his estate
and allowed to use his fabulous home, cars, costumes and jewels in
the filming.
   Another Liberace movie will follow a week later on CBS.
   The ABC version is insistently simplistic and adoring, even
while constantly raising the question of his sexuality. Liberace
always denied he was a homosexual and his spokespeople always
denied he had AIDS. The movie strongly hints that he was gay and
does make plain that he died of AIDS.
   Andrew Robinson stars as Liberace. Rue McClanahan plays his
mother. John Rubinstein plays his long-time confidante, Jamie James.
   Robinson's Liberace _ inexplicably a dark brunette throughout
the movie even though Liberace was fair-haired _ is kind, gentle
and good, dedicated to his public and his beloved mother. His
sexual preference is a nagging, unspoken problem.
   When he announces his intention to marry a young woman he has
met at church, Jamie abruptly excuses himself from the room. The
woman's father calls off the wedding because of ``rumors'' and
fears that Liberace and his daughter would never produce
grandchildren. Years later, when Liberace's sister-in-law surprises
him by setting him up with an adoring female fan, he rushes from
the room in embarrassment.
   Scott Thorson, the companion and employee who filed a palimony
suit against Liberace in 1982, is portrayed (by Marius Valainis) as
an opportunist who turned on Liberace after he was fired. As
Liberace explains the relationship to Jamie, ``It's something about
strays, about being needed.''
   At one point, after the Thorson affair becomes public, Liberace
is asked point-blank by a reporter if he is homosexual. He answers
the question by saying he doesn't believe ``that entertainers
should publicly air their sexual or political tastes.''
   But he adds, ``with a name like Liberace, which stands for
freedom, I'm for anything with the letters L-I-B, and that includes
gay lib.''
   If the filmmakers wanted to avoid dwelling on Liberace's love
life, they could have spent more time on his music. There are
several musical numbers _ Mike Garson was the piano stand-in,
though Robinson does a good job of faking it _ but Liberace's
proficiency at the piano seems to be maintained magically, since he
is never shown to have any particular passion for the instrument.
   Instead, there's shallow pop psychology. For instance, his
musician father walked out on the family just before Christmas, so
Liberace was determined that every Christmas thereafter would be
happy. And trivia _ he first saw a candelabra on a piano in the
movie ``A Song to Remember.''
   To its credit, the movie never aspires to be anything more than
an affectionate portrait of a kind man who gave his all, and the
best scenes are in the concluding montage: a triumphant Liberace
performs an exhausting sellout run at Radio City Music Hall in
1986, while backstage he struggles against the disease that will
kill him within months. At one point, he admits to Jamie that he
regrets never having had children, even though he always said his
21 dogs substituted for them.
   At the end of the movie, the words appear on the screen,
``Wladziu Valentino Liberace died from complications relating to
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome on February 4, 1987.''
   This is followed by a brief epilogue in which Robinson, as a
young Liberace, comes out and sits at a piano lit only by the
candelabra. ``I'd like to be remembered as a kind and gentle soul
who made the world a little better place to live in because I lived
in it,'' he says. Then he blows out the candles one by one.

   For a decade, in a bucolic corner of
Mississippi, the Rev. Herman Fountain ran his Bethel Home for
Children. From time to time, tales of abuse circulated, but nothing
came of them _ Mississippi is one of six states where such church
homes are unlicensed and rarely scrutinized. But as this summer
began, a boy's tale of beatings, neglect and imprisonment brought
state authorities to Bethel's door and ignited a conflict fueled by
outrage from both sides. ``Gates of Hell'' is the story of these
children, who have been given pseudonyms to protect their
identities as required by Mississippi law, of their lives inside
Bethel and of the emotional struggle over their futures _ and their
souls. This is the first installment of three.

   The time had come. Patrick was ready. He
would hide and wait, and when the moment was right, he would blow
through the gates of hell and never look back.
   Quietly now, quietly. He slipped inside the locker and waited,
hardly breathing. The other kids at the Bethel Home for Children
were filing past, on their way to church.
   Patrick opened the locker door. To the bicycle by the steps.
Carefully now, carefully. If anyone saw, he would be caught, and
there'd be more punishment, more pain, more humiliation.
   No more. He'd had enough for a lifetime.

   Kathy Prine had just finished stabling her horse when the phone
rang Sunday, May 8. It was after 7 p.m.
   As a child welfare investigator in George County, she was used
to calls at all hours, seven days a week. It was the sheriff's
office: another runaway from Bethel. That wasn't unusual. The
Baptist church home's 10-year history was rife with kids trying to
escape its rigorous regimen.
   Prine had dealt with some of Bethel's children but had never
seen the operation firsthand. Because the state does not license
its church-run boarding homes, and therefore cannot regulate them,
it rarely ventures in.
   Among those who have, some call them hospitals for the soul;
others consider them spiritual torture chambers.
   The truth about the Bethel Home for Children was a matter of
opinion.
   In 1980, a runaway brought assault charges against Bethel's
founder, the Rev. Herman Fountain, for a beating he received with a
switch _ ``licks,'' Fountain called them. After a hearing, the
Youth Court judge removed all the children and directed the church
to follow certain regulations. But the charges were dropped and the
order was never enforced. Many of the children were returned to
Bethel.
   Since then, other children had run away, and others told stories
of abuse and neglect. But few had been at Bethel long enough to be
credible witnesses, the kind whose stories would hold up in court.
   Now there was Patrick.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   He had come to Bethel in October 1986 at age 13, a sometime
truant sent from Florida by his mother.
   Life might have been hard at home, but Bethel was like boot camp
with a wrathful God as drill sergeant. Patrick's description was
the same as those of other children and that of Herman Fountain
himself.
   Each day had a schedule: up at 5 a.m., so many minutes in the
bathroom, so many minutes to dress, so many to clean the dormitory.
There were prayer sessions morning and evening.
   In the summers, the children picked beans, pulled weeds on the
church's 28 acres, dug ditches, picked up trash and cared for
Bethel's menagerie of goats, horses, ducks and deer. Sometimes
crews of children would tear down abandoned buildings, including
some at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, and return with what they
salvaged to Bethel, where it would become part of new structures
they built themselves.
   There was no payment for work, but plenty of punishment for
slackers.
   In the winters, they had Bible memorization and school. Lessons
came from religious workbooks. Often, children had to erase other
children's answers to fill in their own.
   Like every new Bethel charge, Patrick spent his first month ``on
watch'' under the eye of more trusted child. Children on watch were
allowed to speak only to designated individuals. It was a way to
prevent them from planning escapes. Talking on watch meant sure
punishment.

   There were no calls to parents for the first two months, and no
visits for the first six.
   Incoming mail was opened and money was removed. Letters home
that complained about Bethel were ordered rewritten. Telephone
calls, when allowed, were monitored.
   Meals were heavy on oatmeal, grits and rice. At the end of the
week, leftovers were mixed together, a meal the kids called
``compost stew.'' Failure to eat everything on the plate brought
punishment.
   No cigarettes, drugs, alcohol or carbonated drinks were allowed.
There was no television, no radio, no movies: these worldly media
were of the devil. So were newspapers, magazines and most music,
except certain religious selections. At night, trusted children
guarded the doors against runaways. No one was allowed out.
   This was the program, steeped in fundamental religion, rooted in
biblical principles and imbued, its supporters said, with the
Lord's power to change incorrigibles into God-fearing, clean-living
Christians. And anyone who deviated from it, in word, deed or
spirit, learned a lesson about pain.
   Patrick had learned those lessons well.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Mark Maples questioned Patrick closely. Maples had been George
County prosecutor only since January, but he had already
interviewed several former Bethel children.
   The 30-year-old Maples had grown up in George County, and he
knew a little about Bethel. In a town the size of Lucedale, with
2,500 residents, it was hard to avoid. Some days at lunchtime,
Bethel preachers stood out on Main Street, hollering about hell and
damnation to passersby.
   That usually prompted stories from the patrons at the nearby
Coffee Pot restaurant, but mostly they left the subject alone.
After all, they figured, none of the kids out there was local; they
probably were bad kids who deserved what they got.
   Now this boy was telling Maples stories as awful as any he had
heard. It would take testimony from those who'd left earlier and
knew Patrick, and two more who would leave after his escape, to
corroborate his treatment from the day he arrived to the day he
fled Herman Fountain.

   In 1969, Fountain was a heroin addict dabbling in witchcraft. He
had forsaken his native Oklahoma for the streets of New York; in
three years, he says, he lost his family and his health, ending up
in a Queens hospital with hepatitis from shooting up with a dirty
needle.
   Then he found the Lord.
   Born again, he won back his family and went off to bible college
in Pensacola, Fla., later moving to Corpus Christi, Texas, to join
the ministries of the Rev. Lester Roloff, an evangelist who ran a
well-publicized home for troubled children before his death in a
1982 plane crash.
   Fountain felt the call to begin his own ministry and his own
children's home, and in 1978, he, wife Carol, and seven children
pulled into Lucedale.
   His Bethel Baptist church and children's home thrived. At one
point, as many as 150 children were on campus. Parents who could
afford it paid $275 a month plus $750 for materials and
registration. Some paid less. Some paid nothing.
   It didn't matter to Fountain. The Lord had called him for this
work.
   The state had tried to shut him down in 1980 and failed. Six
years later, the welfare department raided the Bethesda Home for
Girls in Hattiesburg, run by his friend, the Rev. Bob Wills, and
Wills' wife, Betty Sue.
   The 113 girls taken from the home spoke of strip-searches,
paddlings and starvation diets. One-fourth of the girls reported
missing their menstrual periods for two months to a year _ the
result, Mrs. Wills forthrightly explained, of stress brought on by
much-needed discipline.
   Discipline. That was the key to a spiritual life, the Willses
believed, and Fountain agreed wholeheartedly. Children needed
discipline. It said as much in the Bible, and his charges knew
Proverbs 23:13 by heart:
   ``Do not withhold correction from a child,
   For if you beat him with a rod, he will not die.
   You shall beat him with a rod
   And deliver his soul from hell.''
   That was Fountain's calling: delivering young souls from hell.

   The Rev. Herman Fountain, founder of the Bethel
Home for Children, had been accused before of abusing children in
his care, although little was done. But this time was different.
State Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain Jr., who had become
increasingly convinced that many Bethel kids were being physically
and emotionally brutalized, would not back down. The battle lines
were drawn. The first stones would be cast by frightened children.
This is the second of three installments.

   On June 1, Patrick took the witness
stand. Herman Fountain was staring at him.
   The story Patrick told was one of a child subjected to constant
ridicule and bullying. Hardly a day passed of his 18 months at the
Bethel Home for Children when he was not hit with a switch for some
offense, real or imagined. Talking without permission, slacking off
on a job, looking at a girl: all were unpardonable offenses at
Bethel.
   The whippings left bruises and raised welts. Some children later
testified at Patrick's hearing that they saw others bleed, and
their clothing would stick to the dried blood.
   Laps were another common punishment. Patrick said he would be
awakened at 4 a.m., an hour before the Bethel day began, and made
to run laps around a track. Twenty-five laps, or about 2{ miles,
was a typical distance. Sometimes, the run would be timed: 45
seconds a lap. Those who couldn't keep up the 7.5 minute per mile
pace had to run more, or received other punishment.
   Push-ups were common; even the smallest boys might be told to do
50. The ``rose garden'' was a series of calisthenics _ push-ups,
leg lifts, sit-ups. Children ordered to do a ``minefield'' walked
up and down a football field on their hands and toes.
   Brother David Owens, in charge of the girls, was known among the
children for two particular exercises: the ``chair,'' in which a
child had to assume a sitting position against a wall, and another
where she would stand on tiptoe with her chin against the wall as
high as she could hold it.
   When the children were put to work, Patrick more often than not
was in the ``nigger crew,'' the boys assigned to do the dirtiest,
most strenuous work. He might work his way to a good crew, but a
moment of horseplay would send him right back to nigger crew, where
he would be forced to do something even worse than before.
   While a backhoe and bulldozer sat idle, the crew dug a ditch,
4-feet-deep and a half-mile long, and Patrick was ordered to dig in
front of the rest, where the ground had yet to be broken.
   When they started the ditch, Patrick said later, six children
tried to run away.
   Some children said they were injured while working or were
forced to work or run laps while ill. Some received prompt medical
attention, but others did not. A local doctor testified he told
Bethel adults that Patrick would lose sight in one eye without
glasses, but they were never ordered.
   Once, other children were told to throw dirt clods at him while
he was in the ditch. Sometimes he was subjected to the ``nigger
pile''; on a leader's order, other children would hit him, knock
him to the ground and pile on top of him.
   Sleep was no escape. Patrick, who suffered from a bed-wetting
problem, was put on all-night ``pee watch,'' awakened hourly to
urinate, whether or not he needed to, and punished if he refused.
   When he wet the bed, he was hit again.
   Daily humiliation and punishment for a problem he couldn't
control became unbearable, and he sought out an older boy, Scott,
for advice.
   ``I said, `Let the Lord handle it,''' Scott said later.
   ``Scott, I'm tired of waiting around for the Lord,'' Patrick
replied. ``I'm going to do something myself.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On June 8, the second day of Patrick's hearing, Mark Maples, the
county prosecutor, called Herman Fountain to the stand.
   It was about time, Maples felt, for Fountain to explain himself.
Fountain had other ideas. The state was meddling. This was a church
matter, and it would remain so.
   Beyond giving his name and address, he refused to answer
questions, citing the ``separation of church and state.''
   ``Who's in charge at Bethel?'' Maples asked.
   ``The Lord Jesus Christ,'' Fountain replied.
   ``What mortal is in charge at Bethel?'' Maples tried again.
   ``No mortal is in charge,'' Fountain said. ``We are a group of
reborn Christians serving the Lord Jesus Christ, and he alone is in
charge.''
   Questions about the childrens' nutrition, education, punishment,
work and medical needs went unanswered. Judge Robert Oswald found
Fountain in contempt of court and ordered him to jail, a sentence
that lasted 30 minutes. Jail, the judge decided, was not going to
compel this man to cooperate.
   ``He could see it in my eyes,'' Fountain said later.
   Later that week, Oswald found Fountain, Owens and another
assistant, Brother Tom MacDonald, in contempt and ordered fines
totaling $1,500 a day until they agreed to cooperate. The fines
would top $100,000, but Fountain had made his decision.
   So had the judge. Patrick's story had convinced him of physical
abuse, medical neglect and unreasonable detention, at the very
least. The other children would be removed from Bethel, and he
would hear their stories, too.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Arrangements were made to take the children by bus to the
Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield, a mental institution with
enough security and vacant dormitories to house them temporarily.
   Back at Bethel, Fountain gathered the children in the church.
``You're going to a nuthouse,'' he told them. ``I have no more
control over you.''
   Within minutes, the serene campus was in an uproar. As welfare
workers and buses stood by, some children scurried for the trees,
police on their heels. State troopers and sheriff's deputies spent
hours picking up others found wandering along the streets or hiding
in private homes.
   Other children went willingly.
   ``In a way, I felt good,'' 12-year-old Joshua said of the chance
to leave Bethel. ``In a way I felt bad, because there were some
kids who did not have homes, didn't have nowhere to go. Some kids
didn't know what to do.
   ``That was their home.''

   Many of the children of Bethel are human
throwaways, tossed out by parents who no longer want to deal with
them or no longer know how.
   Some of the kids have no parents. Others simply feel as if they
don't.
   ``I would phone,'' said 12-year-old Joshua, clutching his
red-leather Bible. ``But they wouldn't accept my calls.''
   The children, whose names have been changed to meet Mississippi
law about juveniles' identities, came from across the nation, with
the majority from Texas, Florida, Arizona and Washington. Some had
physical or mental disabilities such as hyperactivity or Down's
syndrome. Some had emotional problems, drug or alcohol habits or
had been in trouble with the police.
   Others were typical teen-agers experiencing the upheaval of
adolescence, and all the confusion and rebellion that comes with
growing up.
   Scott, adopted at age 7 by people who later changed their minds,
bounced in and out of foster homes for years. His last family sent
him to Bethel two years ago. ``My parents had written me after I
was there for a while and said the reason I was there was because
they didn't have the facilities to handle me and take care of me.
   ``They wanted someone who would take the responsibility on them
of bringing me up right. My parents never really wanted me.''
   Freed from Bethel by the state, Scott earned his GED equivalency
certificate (because the Bethel school is unaccredited, its
diplomas are not recognized by any state) and applied for
cosmetology school. He began dating Stephanie, another former
Bethel resident, and they plan to marry someday and raise a family.
Both say Bethel taught them how not to treat children.
   ``I'm not going to have my kid switched every second he acts
up,'' Scott said. ``I'm going to make sure I can deal with it.''
   ``I'd try to work out any problems with my child,'' said
15-year-old Stephanie, who wants to be a teacher. ``If that didn't
work, I'd keep on trying. I'd never give up. I'd never send them to
a place like Bethel.''
   Scott and Stephanie are in counseling now, as are all the Bethel
children in state custody. Months and months of being told that the
outside world is Satan's playground, that saying, thinking, doing
or feeling certain things will send them straight to hell, has left
many confused and fearful.
   But for others, Bethel is salvation. Outsiders don't understand
what they were, what they've become, and what they went through
along the way. One after the other they will say they deserved the
whippings they used to get, but they don't deserve the bad rap
they're getting now.
   These are Fountain's success stories, followers like Sophia, who
call the pastor ``Daddy.'' Arriving at Bethel in 1985 was like
landing on another planet for the rebellious 16-year-old street
veteran from Boca Raton, Fla., a drug abuser and runaway who
frequented every tavern's ladies night in town.
   ``I thought these people were crazy,'' she recalled. ``I got
smart to Brother Fountain, and he said, `I'm going to bust your
bottom!' He showed me a switch. I thought, `A twig! What's that
going to do?'''
   She soon found out. Back talk to the dorm leader ended in a
brawl broken up by Brother Owens and his switch.
   ``He smacked me around,'' Sophia said. ``It's the first spanking
I ever got. And whoa! I knew they meant business. I was cussing up
a storm.''
   The head leader slapped Sophia's face, and when Brother Fountain
came back, he slapped her, too.
   ``I said, `Go ahead and kill me.' Everything had been drained
out of me,'' she said. ``All that rebellion that I had built up for
16 years of my life was gone. The devil really was beat out of me.''
   She spent a week in the revival room, a small, windowless room
used to isolate disruptive children, where two girls pointed out
the error of her ways. ``They talked to me and they helped me and
they showed me the Lord, and I got saved.''
   Her eyes opened, she realized she had finally come home.
   ``You can say, `Do good, do good. But they lived it. They're
really happy,'' Sophia said, and she started to cry. ``I came here
and they showed me something like a reason to live, a purpose in
life.''
   Now 20 and married, dandling her baby boy on her lap, Sophia
believes she has found the happiness she craved.
   ``I love this home,'' she said resolutely. ``I can't believe
what all these ignorant people are doing, saying I'm brainwashed!
If I'm brainwashed, I think everybody needs to be.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The court-ordered removal of children from the
Bethel Home for Children due to suspicion of brutality and neglect
infuriated founder Herman Fountain, who bitterly regretted his
failure to defy authorities in the name of church rights. Before
the battle of Bethel was over, he would have another chance to do
just that. This is the third and concluding installment of ``Gates
of Hell.''

   Friday's raid at the Bethel Home for
Children was followed by Monday's last stand.
   Over the weekend, word reached Judge Robert Oswald that some of
the children who had fled police had returned to Bethel. He ordered
authorities back to the church to retrieve any children they could
find.
   Bethel founder Herman Fountain, in Youth Court awaiting further
hearing testimony, caught wind of the action and ordered his staff
to ignore the subpoenas that had summoned them and return to
Bethel. There would be no compromise on this day.
   Fountain locked the church doors, barricading three dozen
parents and children in the church they had built by hand. Dozens
of state troopers and sheriff's deputies stood by for more than
three hours, while Welfare Commissioner Thomas Brittain Jr. tried
to negotiate the childrens' release.
   Police finally broke in and took the children, while church
members recited Bible verse and sang hymns.
   ``If God be for us who can be against us?'' read the Bethel sign
by the road.
   Fountain; his eldest son, Herman Jr., nicknamed Bubba, and
Brother David Owens were among eight people arrested that day.
Fountain faces three counts of felonious assault on a police
officer and one count of inciting a riot, all scheduled to be
presented to the grand jury later this month.
   Troubles seemed to overrun the pastor like the locusts of
Pharaoh's Egypt. A former Bethel resident, Rhonnda Traxler,
gathered reporters outside the courthouse and alleged Fountain
sexually molested her and another girl while they were at Bethel.
Fountain denied the accusation and leveled his own: ``You can't
believe this girl. There's no telling how many men she's been
with.''
   Another former Bethel child, Ray Friery, filed a $1 million
federal lawsuit against Fountain, alleging assault and battery,
abuse, neglect and false imprisonment.
   Fountain wasn't the only one with problems. Many state workers
involved in the case received harassing phone calls or believed
they were being followed by Bethel supporters.
   Brittain sent his 13-year-old daughter out of state after
anonymous callers threatened to kidnap her and put her in a church
home where she would never be found again.

<TEXT>
   Before the Youth Court hearings ended, about half of the more
than 70 children taken from Bethel had testified. Some were too
frightened to appear.
   ``They're really wicked little kids,'' Fountain said in a later
interview with The Associated Press. ``I'm talking about
homosexuals, I'm talking about lesbians, I'm talking about
prostitutes. I'm talking about one boy who raped his 84-year-old
grandmother. I'm talking about one who murdered his sister.
   ``I'm talking habitual runaways, I'm talking car thieves, I'm
talking nymphomaniacs.''
   Brittain dealt with the same youngsters but saw something
different.
   ``For the most part, they're pretty normal kids who have been
battered around by life pretty badly,'' the welfare commissioner
said. ``They're children trying to put their lives back together.''
   Some parents had despaired of getting help from state agencies;
for them, Bethel was a last resort. For others, it was a matter of
convenience. One child was sent to Bethel because he ``took food
from the refrigerator,'' Brittain said.
   But as the hearing continued after the raid on Bethel, some
parents sat in the courtroom and wept, overwhelmed by stories of
hair-pulling, face-slapping, lap-running and switchings. A
13-year-old girl with Down's syndrome said she ran laps all day
long, received frequent spankings and sometimes stood for hours on
tiptoe with her chin above a light switch.
   ``They said she was a little brat and had a demon in her,''
another girl said. ``Parents agreed with it. They said that's what
you deserve if you've acted in a wrong way.''
   Some parents said they were misled. They didn't know what Bethel
really was. Other parents knew exactly what Bethel was.
   ``When I went down there, I was totally convinced what had
occurred was not morally right, legally right or anyway right,''
said Jack Hicks of Birdsboro, Pa. But his two teen-age sons support
Fountain, and they changed his mind.

   ``They love the man tremendously. If my children said to me,
`Dad, that's not the way it was, they were cruel and abused us,'
I'd be after Brother Fountain,'' he said. ``But they've solidified
my support.''
   About 50 of the children were released to their parents, who
signed a court agreement not to return them to Bethel without the
judge's approval. Protecting the children this way was about all
the state and Judge Oswald could do since Bethel is a private,
unregulated facility.
   Now a dozen parents, including Hicks, are preparing a lawsuit
against the state for its action at Bethel.
   ``I look at this much beyond just an incident that occurred in
the state of Mississippi,'' Hicks said. ``Let's term it religious
harassment.''
   __=
   Life is slow at Bethel these days, with so few children around.
The home remains open, but rows of girls' bunk beds stand empty
except for the stuffed bears and rabbits left behind by former
occupants.
   A few new children have come since the hearings. A few former
residents have returned.
   No winner has emerged from the emotional battle over Bethel,
which begins and ends with a collision of convictions.
   Brittain and his team of investigators, Oswald and prosecutor
Mark Maples consider it a matter of child protection.
   Herman Fountain, his faithful flock and other fundamentalists
who came to lend support have called it an issue of religious
freedom.
   Conservative religious belief courses through Mississippi's
veins and beats fiercely in its heart. The perception that the
state is venturing into the realm of the church makes blood run
hot. But so does the perception that church home operators are
using fundamental religion and the Bible as justification to abuse
and neglect children.
   ``I'm a Christian; they're supposed to be Christians,'' said
welfare investigator Kathy Prine, who teaches Sunday school at her
Baptist church. ``I believe this is wrong. These kids are being
physically abused. These people claim the kids are liars and are
not being abused but are being raised by what the Bible says.
   ``It makes you question your faith and your job. When we went in
there, I asked someone, `Am I hurting the church? Am I hurting
God's work by doing this?' I thought about it, and I said, `No. No,
I'm not.'''
   Oswald, in his order removing the children from Bethel, wrote,
``If there is a conflict of interests between religion and the
protection of children, this Court's decision must be to protect
first the children.''
   Fountain sees it another way. ``I dealt with (Oswald) in
chambers, about his soul. He says, `The laws of the land are first
and that (the) Bible's second,''' Fountain said. ``I said, `That's
wrong, that Bible's first and the law of the land is second.'''
   Mississippi, along with North Carolina, South Carolina,
Louisiana, Missouri and Florida, has no law licensing church-run
boarding homes, although some voluntarily apply for licenses.
   As a result, there is no way to reach many of the children in
such homes, many of whom are denied communication with the outside
for months at a time, or to ensure that basic educational,
sanitation and safety standards are met.
   ``We've had to wait years to collect information in bits and
pieces from runaway children,'' Brittain said. ``We have no way of
knowing what's going on inside those four walls.''
   Maples has filed a court petition to force Bethel to comply with
state laws governing education, safety standards and child labor
laws. The court has yet to act on it. If enforced, such an order
could close Bethel, because Fountain has said he would never
cooperate.
   For the two years he has been welfare commissioner, Brittain has
pushed for a law to open the doors of homes like Bethel; Fountain
has prayed against one.
   This might well be the year that the power of prayer is overcome
by the power of politics: observers agree that outrage over
conditions at Bethel has been so great that the Legislature might
be forced to act.
   Even Fountain agrees, saying, ``It would take an act of God'' to
prevent a licensure law from emerging in the next legislative
session.
   At Bethel, they will be praying round the clock.
   ``They're going against God, and that's their problem. That's
why we're going to win,'' Fountain said. ``The gates of hell ain't
going to prevail against our church.''

<HEAD>SWARTHMORE: class president.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis was a cross-country track star, captain of the tennis
team and, at only 5-foot-8, a guard on the basketball team
emulating the backcourt hustle of rookie Bob Cousy, his idol on the
Boston Celtics. He played first trumpet in the band, suffering
chapped lips in the Thanksgiving Day football classic with ancient
rival Newton.
   ``Oikonomia'' _ economy, as preached by his father _ dictated
chores after school and odd jobs like working as a garbage
collector on summer vacations.
   Sandy doesn't recall his ``being particularly penurious, but
none of us had much back then. A heavy date was an ice cream soda
at Ho-Jo's. We went to lots of Red Sox games. He was a rabid fan,
and I presume in those days the boy always bought the tickets.''
   Fibbing about his age, l7-year-old Dukakis entered the 26-mile
Boston Marathon. Practically the whole senior class turned out to
cheer him up Heartbreak Hill and beg cups of water from the
drugstores along Beacon Street as he finished a respectable 57th.
   As recorded in Murivian, Brookline's yearbook, Dukakis was
elected president and ``pledged allegiance to the ideals of the
Honorary Society, Alpha Pi.''
   ``Big Chief Brain in the Face,'' as the book dubbed him, was too
busy that frantic senior year to notice Kitty Dickson, a pretty
freshman and already outspoken feminist, who a dozen years later
would be introduced to her future husband and now presidential
candidate by her best friend Sandy Bakalar.
   ``Running as if chased by Republicans,'' as The Phoenix, the
college weekly, noted, marathon man Michael continued to excel in
cross-country at Swarthmore, where even the football team sometimes
experienced the loneliness of the long-distance runner. Letters to
the Phoenix regularly complained that alumni outnumbered students
in the wooden bleachers that still resemble a Little League field.
   Sports were definitely small-time at Swarthmore, where home runs
landed in the astronomy professor Peter van de Kamp's rose garden.
Only the chess team went undefeated in the Dukakis years, but the
football team finally had a winning season, 4-3, in his senior
year. The Garnets, also called the Little Quakers, managed to suit
up some outstanding athletes. Dick Hall, two years ahead, went
directly from the campus to the Pittsburgh Pirates outfield. Tight
end Charles ``Chuck'' Cooper, Michael's junior year roommate,
turned down a contract with the Los Angeles Rams and went on to
become an economic adviser to several occupants of the White House.
   Founded by the Society of Friends in 1864, Swarthmore had long
since dropped its denominational ties, but the Quaker ideals of
tolerance, high standards of personal conduct and dedication to
world peace and disarmament still wafted across campus like a
benign breeze.
   Pennsylvania Military Adademy was kindly requested not to fire
its touchdown cannon at football games. On Thursday mornings the
entire student body gathered in Clothier Memorial for
``collection,'' an assembly dedicated to moral or cultural uplift
by friendly persuasion.
   In World War I, an army training unit was permitted on campus,
but the cadets paraded without rifles. British poet W.H. Auden
taught composition to a Navy V-12 unit in World War II, when the
campus was a meld of O.C.'s and C.O.'s: cadet officers and
conscientious objectors. After much agonizing, the administration
rejected an ROTC unit during the Korean War.
   Two months after arriving on campus, Dukakis on Nov. 3, l951,
celebrated his 18th birthday by registering for the draft. There
were recurrent reminders in the Phoenix from Gen. Lewis Blaine
Hershey that students were not exempt but deferred from the draft
if they maintained a C-average.
   An army recruiter took pains one day to explain that ``in an
infantry division of 20,000 men, only 3,000 carried rifles while
the great majority were occupied in non-combat units.'' His remarks
concluded to polite applause and the release of a dove.
   ``Many were critical of our involvement in the war,'' Dean Stott
remembers, ``but the college made it clear this was a moral
obligation.''
   Actually, fraternities were a bigger issue on campus in the
early '50s. Swarthmore was and is a dry town, and the five frat
houses offered beer along with brotherhood.
   ``A wild Friday night party might go on until 12:30,'' says
Leigh Whitaker, who like Preston, belonged to Delta Upsilon when
their Wharton dorm mate Dukakis signed a letter in the Phoenix
telling freshmen they didn't need to join a fraternity to have a
good time at Swarthmore.
   His main objection was a clause in some national charters
discriminating against Jews and blacks. When a campus poll favored
retaining fraternities, two of which still survive, Dukakis served
on a bipartisan committee that recommended severing ties with
national fraternities that discriminated.

<TEXT>
   As congressional anti-subversive investigators began questioning
professors at nearby Temple University, young Dukakis joined and
soon became campus president of Students for Democratic Action. He
lobbied rural lawmakers to oppose a loyalty oath bill in the
Pennsylvania Assembly and, according to Victor Navasky, now editor
of the Nation Magazine, talked one out of every four schoolmates
into joining the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``Sen. Joseph McCarthy's excesses had a great deal to do with my
seriously thinking about entering politics,'' Dukakis recently
recalled.
   In the election year of 1952, he was president of Students for
Stevenson, who by a healthy margin became the first Democrat to win
the campus straw vote. Although Republicans were ``thin on the
ground'' to test the Dukakis debating skills, Preston recalls a
bull session on the third floor of Wharton ``when someone mentioned
that Michael had it in him to go all the way, meaning the White
House.''
   Ted also remembers the spring of their junior year ``when
murmurs of real excitement ran through the dining hall as Jo-Jo
Black spread the word that her father, Justice Hugo Black, had just
telephoned news of the Supreme Court decision outlawing school
segregation. At Swarthmore, that was bigger than a World Series
result.''
   Swarthmore's liberalism rankled many of the neighbors in the
rest of Delaware County where Republicans outnumbered Democrats 8
to l.
   Dukakis recently recalled for an alumni group in Boston how the
conductor on the West Chester local always sang out as the train
approached the station before Swarthmore: ``Morton, the stop before
Moscow.''
   His admission to the honors program, which Swarthmore pioneered,
put him in the top eschelon of a remarkably brainy student body.
His campus contemporaries included Howard Tenin, a quiet member of
the wrestling team who would win a Nobel Prize in medicine; Carl
Levin, the future U.S. senator from Michigan; Rhodes scholar Frank
Sieverts, budding novelist Hugh Nissenson and future physicians Jon
Fine and Richard Burtis, his hitchhiking buddy on summer vacations.
   But the undergrad going wasn't all grind. There were midnight
sled rides down Parrish Hill on cafeteria trays. ``Freshman
Serenade,'' a fall fertility rite, erupted into a panty raid his
first year. The girls on the top floor of Parrish Hall defended
their lingerie by dumping wastebaskets of water on the male
marauders and inserting toilet plungers into the handles of the
dorm's double doors.
   Dean of Men Everett Hunt appeared out of the shadows to restore
order and was promptly deluged with a tub of sudsy laundry water.
``Proves the campus isn't completely lifeless,'' he sputtered
philosophically, taking to his bed with a bad case of chills.
   Next term the Poenix reported ``two gentlemen adventurers'' were
suspended for a week for scaling the college water tower ``and
engraving thereon fraternal Greek letters.''
   Then there was the outrageous Adlai hoax that brought reporters
and photographers swarming to the campus from the Philadelphia
dailies. At the beginning of the 1953 spring term, Swarthmore was
seeking a replacement for President John Nason, who was leaving to
head the Foreign Policy Association. Frank Irish, who ran with
Dukakis on the cross-country team, raced through the night to the
firm that printed the Phoenix and substituted a bogus front page
that proclaimed in tabloid-sized headlines ``Adlai Prexy!!''
   The story spuriously quoted outgoing president Nason, ``if our
students thought Mr. Stevenson would make a good president for the
country then he ought to be good enough for our college.''
   The administration was aghast and embarrassed, but Stevenson on
vacation in the Caribbean was amused and cabled his ``hope that the
college will not deal harshly with my beloved and youthful
friends.''
   Elected to Phi Betta Kappa, as well as president of the student
council, Dukakis was one of five in a class of 210 to graduate with
highest honors. He might have been and should have been president
of his graduating class. The yearbook shows him seated with
officers of the Class of '55, but shortly after it went to press,
Swarthmore, with characteristic egalitarianism, voted to abolish
all class officers.
   Now another Michael is the focus of attention at Swarthmore.
Mikhail Chkhenkeli, from Tblisi in Soviet Georgia, is among the
first of a glasnost coterie of Soviet students arriving at American
colleges.
   Mikhail fulfills a cultural exchange first proposed by the
student council when Michael Dukakis was its president.

   The modest periodical first hit grade school
desks in 1928. ``Poor Boys Who Made Good Are Now Running for the
Highest Office in the World!'' read the headline over stories about
Herbert Hoover and Alfred Smith.
   So much for news. Inside were stories about dandelions and
sunshine, a few rudimentary drawings and a poem extolling the
curative powers of cod liver oil.
   It was an inauspicious beginning for what has proven a classroom
institution. ``Weekly Reader,'' the little newspaper read by
generations of American school children, celebrates its 60th
birthday this fall, still going strong with 9 million readers who
pay an average of $2.25 a year to subscribe.
   It will mark the occasion with ``60 Years of News for Kids,'' a
book made up of stories from past editions and aimed at a
potentially vast audience: the two-thirds of American adults who
grew up with ``Weekly Reader.'' Eight editions are published for
the different grade levels.
   Among them is current Editor-in-Chief Terry Borton, whose own
``Weekly Reader'' years coincided with the end of World War II when
subscribers were encouraged to save resources and buy War Bonds.
``I remember a sense of being mobilized by the school and by
`Weekly Reader,''' Borton says.
   Judging from its promotional materials, Pharos Books, the
publisher of ``60 Years of News for Kids,'' hopes to generate a
tidal wave of nostalgia: ``Remember blackboards and chalk dust ...
schoolyards and recess ... Fridays and `Weekly Reader?'''
   In some instances the book may indeed more accurately reflect
chalk dust than history; especially in its early years, ``Weekly
Reader'' found much of the news unfit for its pages. It declined to
cover the crash of 1929. The Great Depression was played down and
the Holocaust was ignored altogether.
   ``... We promise to do our share in guarding America's children
from the hazards of fear, tensions and frustration and to
contribute to emotional stability through the inspiration and
reassurances which the carefully selected current content of `My
Weekly Reader' brings to children,'' founder Eleanor Johnson
reassured teachers in 1942. ``Ours shall be a positive philosophy
of optimism.''
   Accordingly, ``Weekly Reader'' made valiant attempts to put a
happy face on World War II. Young readers were told that
``thousands of American men are learning to cook and sew'' in the
Army, and that nifty wartime inventions such as ``butter that won't
spoil, cake flavoring from a tablet, dishes that bounce but don't
break when dropped'' would soon be available for civilian use.
   Closer to the news were stories about an imaginary curtain that
divided Germany into two parts; a bitter fight between Arabs and
Jews over Palestine; India celebrating its independence from Great
Britain.
   ``Weekly Reader'' also devoted a fair amount of space to news of
inventions, innovations and pop culture.
   ``When the Fairy Godmother turned the pumpkin into a coach, she
used magic,'' a 1946 feature began. ``Nowadays, there is a new kind
of magic. This magic is called `plastics.'''
   Another magical invention announced in 1949: a camera that could
make pictures in one minute.
   The '50s brought slightly harder-edged stories about the Korean
War, the Suez Canal, Sputnik. A 1954 story gave background on a war
being fought in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. A 1957 piece focused on
plans by six European nations to establish a common market.
   The newspaper also filled its pages with breathless accounts of
postwar progress, of supermarkets and superhighways, convenience
foods and jet airplanes, polio vaccines and nuclear power.
   Readers were reminded in 1951 that ``people making the first
long-distance phone calls will have to keep one eye on their
watches.'' For the first time, ``there will be no operator to say,
`Sorry, your time is up.'''
   Two years later, ``Weekly Reader'' reassured kids that TV colors
``are beginning to look more real. Strawberry ice cream in TV ads
looks so good that you can almost taste it.''
   The year 1953 also brought important news from the Soviet Union:
Stalin was dead, replaced by Georgi Malenkov, of whom ``Weekly
Reader'' had this to say: ``His pictures show him to be a short,
fat man. Malenkov spends most of his time at his office. He does
not like to go to parties or talk with strangers.''
   The year 1958 brought a rare product endorsement. ``Hula hoops
are made of plastic. They are a good kind of toy. Whirling hoops is
good exercise for children.''

<TEXT>
   A special memorial issue followed the assassination of John F.
Kennedy. Other 1960s stories touched on the summer riots of '68,
the Six Day War and the first moon landing.
   ``Weekly Reader'' covered the war on poverty but shied away from
the war in Vietnam. ``Not everyone goes along with the president's
plans in Vietnam,'' a 1968 story said. For the most part, ``Weekly
Reader'' let it go at that.
   ``There was a lot of concern about the degree of disagreement
over the war,'' Borton says. ``People were uncertain about how to
handle that. As a result, the Vietnamese War was barely touched on
by the paper.''
   Drugs, Watergate, consumerism, the energy crisis, world hunger,
the exodus from city to suburb, and the revolution in Iran all made
headlines in the '70s. Feature stories told of a new hit TV show
called ``Sesame Street'' (1970), a Soviet gymnast named Olga Korbut
(1973), and a new choking rescue method invented by Dr. Henry
Heimlich (1976).
   Like many newspapers, ``Weekly Reader'' has refined its use of
graphics in the '80s. This year's editions have a decidedly more
contemporary look, with color photos in all eight editions.
   ``Weekly Reader'' now routinely reports on such topics as drug
abuse, apartheid and the arms race, especially in editions aimed at
older children.
   Stories with ``a strong sexual content'' are avoided, Borton
says. While such topics as teen pregnancy are still off-limits,
however, a 1987 story for sixth-graders on the life of AIDS victim
Ryan White pulled no punches. ``... Today, Ryan weighs barely 60
pounds. ... He holds his cold, blue hands over the red-hot coils of
the kitchen stove. Ryan never seems to get warm anymore ...''
   The newspaper covered the attempted assassination of Ronald
Reagan, the Challenger disaster, famine in Africa, and racial
conflict in America. Other recent stories have focused on missing
children and homelessness, the Iran-Contra affair and the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   ``We don't skirt problems,'' says Borton. ``We try to inform
them about what's happening, but we also try to talk about what
people are doing to solve problems, if it's a problem that's being
presented.''
   The paper, which has changed hands several times, was acquired
in 1985 by its current owner, Field Publications, the nation's
largest marketer of children's book clubs.
   Unlike at most newspapers, the Middletown, Conn.-based editorial
staff of 15 teachers and journalists and a half-dozen artists spend
most of their time at the office, rather than in the field. Stories
are culled from other newspapers and magazines, although ``we do
try to develop a child's angle,'' Borton says.
   Occasionally, ``Weekly Reader'' generates news of its own. A
1983 survey of its readers found that 31 percent of fourth-grade
subscribers felt pressured to smoke marijuana. The finding prompted
changes in federal drug abuse prevention strategy, which has since
been modified to include younger kids.
   The news weekly's current circulation of 9 million is up from 6
million in 1977. Its lowest ebb, which came during a drop in school
enrollments, also coincided with the only major format change in
the paper's history.
   ``The paper shifted away from its formula of news and skills in
an attempt to appeal more to kids. There was more children's
interest, and the news became more featury,'' Borton says. ``It
didn't work.''
   Entertaining children was not what Eleanor Johnson had in mind
when she conceived the notion of a newspaper written expressly for
grade school children. Miss Johnson, editor-in-chief for 26 years
and a consultant for 17 more, died a year ago at age 94.
   As a young school administrator in York, Pa., Miss Johnson had
been bothered by a lack of emphasis on current events in the
classroom. ``I saw that children were being given a lot of myths
and folklore to read but were utterly illiterate about what was
happening in the world,'' she once said. ``To live in this world,
newspaper reading is indispensable.''
   The first issue appeared on Sept. 21, 1928, and cost about a
penny. Other than the price, ``Weekly Reader'' hasn't really
changed all that much. It's still guided by its original aim: ``To
present selected, well-written news of interest and value to
children with accuracy and fairness, colorful but uncolored.''
   Borton thinks it's survived because ``it's a lot cheaper than a
newspaper, and every child can have one. It's small and easy to
handle, and most importantly of all, it's written for kids.
   ``The New York Times assumes you understand a great deal about
the world. We assume kids in sixth grade understand what kids in
sixth grade understand.''

   He has written 50 books, a thousand newspaper
articles and once had his own wire service. But mostly Joseph Kane
is a collector of facts about who was the first to do this or that,
a debunker of erroneous history. It's been his calling for most of
his 89 years.

   Joseph Nathan Kane tells a visitor to come to
the 27th floor of an upper West Side building that has only 25
floors. He promises a $5 million view with $5 worth of furniture.
   Joe Kane will also tell you that the Declaration of Independence
was not signed on July 4, 1776, that George Washington was not the
first president, that Elias Howe did not invent the sewing machine
and that Charles Edgar Duryea really manufactured the first
automobile regularly made for sale.
   The 89-year-old ex-newspaperman and author is serious. Kane is
not just the author, but the entire staff of one of the most
unusual and most enduring reference books in the world _ ``Famous
First Facts: A Record of First Happenings, Discoveries, and
Inventions in the United States,'' as its first edition was called
when it was published in 1933.
   Kane is now working on the fifth edition _ the fourth came out
in 1981 _ as well as four other books he hopes to publish within a
year or two.
   Everything emanates out of this unusual apartment that has more
paper, 3-by-5 index cards, reference books and book cases than
places to sit down. Except for a few plants and the Dr Pepper he
keeps in the half-refrigerator, not much in this oddly shaped
oblong room seems to have been purchased in the last half-century.
Make that century.
   Kane, sole inhabitant of this garret for more than 25 years, is
not a man who exaggerates. The view from what passes as a kitchen
is worth $5 million, stretching up the Hudson River, beyond the
George Washington Bridge, down to the World Trade Center and
beyond, across into New Jersey.
   So what if you have to walk up the last two flights because the
elevator stops on 25?
   Kane is author of more than 50 books, some of which he churned
out to pay the rent, such as a forgettable volume called ``What Dog
Is That?'' describing various breeds of dogs. He also has sold more
than 1,000 newspaper articles. He once had his own news service and
was an accredited White House correspondent.
   He has been called a historian, a detective of facts, and a
deglorifier of American history.
   ``History,'' he proclaims, ``is a glorification of fairy tales.
There isn't a thing you know that is correct, but still it is
better to know something that is wrong than not to know anything.''
   It is better, for instance, to think that George Washington was
the first president than not to have any idea. The truth is
Washington was the first president elected under the Constitution,
but Thomas McKean of Delaware was the first president of the United
States in Congress Assembled under the Articles of Confederation in
1781, eight years before Washington took office.
   It is also good to know the importance of July 4, 1776. But the
accurate version, according to Kane, is that the Declaration of
Independence was first ordered ``to be fairly engrossed on
parchment'' on July 19, 1776, and was signed in Philadelphia on
Aug. 2 by 50 members of the original 56 who voted for its adoption.
The other six signed at later times, the last being Thomas McKean,
who was permitted to sign as late as 1781 due to serving in the
Army away from Philadelphia.
   ``Over 50 people have told me their father invented the
automobile, for example,'' he says. ``When I start verifying
claims, I find that someone's father may have invented the fourth
knob on the fifth spark plug on the sixth day at 7 o'clock,'' says
Kane. ``But he didn't invent the automobile.''
   It was Charles Edgar Duryea who opened the Duryea Motor Wagon
Company in Springfield, Mass., in 1895. He began building his
automobile in 1891 and first successfully operated it on April 19,
1892.
   Kane publishes only those facts that can be verified by patent
offices, official records in the Library of Congress, or other
original data.
   ``I'm stupid enough not to believe anything until I see the
proof,'' he says.
   Kane wrote his first book in 1929. It wasn't until four years
later, rejected by 11 publishers, that he sold the idea to the H.W.
Wilson Co., with a little help from librarians he met as he
crisscrossed the United States on an 11-month tour. He showed them
the local facts, which they knew to be correct, and then beseeched
them to write to the California-based company and say they would
love to have such a tome in their reference rooms.

   It wasn't easy work.
   ``I've got stuff in that book _ maybe five or six lines _ that
has taken me 30 to 40 years to verify.''
   Kane has mellowed with the years. He still gives lectures _
``rambles'' he calls them _ and manages to irritate the crowd by
debunking ``truths'' learned in grade school.
   But he's softer now.
   ``I used to be a wise guy. I would write letters correcting
people. I once corrected someone on a number of facts in a
presentation and I embarrassed him and broke his heart. And after
all, what difference does it really make?''
   Kane says he gets three or four calls from the White House each
year, asking him a question. For the White House, he'll answer. But
he makes sure. He knows the number and tells the aide he will call
back. If the aide gives the right number, then Joe Kane stays on
the line and answers the question.
   When industry calls and asks if he can find some first for them,
he explains it will cost $35,000 and he won't guarantee he'll find
the answer. Budget planners don't hop on that kind of honesty.
   ``A lot of what I have in the book is there by serendipity. It's
not something I set out to look up. You can't look up half of these
things. You just come across them as you go along.''
   Kane plays a 50-year-old record for a visitor, memorabilia from
Kane's career as a writer for the early quiz shows. He wrote all
the questions for ``Break the Bank,'' a network radio show that
began in 1945 and finally finished up on television in the '50s.
Kane also supplied some questions for ``The $64,000 Question'' and
``Double or Nothing'' and had just written a book on how to win on
quiz shows when scandal rocked the industry and the book lost its
chance to become a big seller.
   In a safe deposit box, Kane has a number of other treasures,
including the first fountain pen, a shoe with a revolving heel to
account for wear and the first safety pin with the patent number
still on it. That number, for trivia buffs, is 24,517.
   His newspaper articles are stored in metal boxes, over a century
old, that the New York Central used to keep its records in.
   Kane is an expert on presidents and is working on the fifth
edition of ``Facts About the Presidents.''
   Kane is a slightly shrunken 5-feet-8, with white hair, a neatly
trimmed white beard, a fairly brisk gait, and general good health,
despite a slight hearing loss. He says his parents lived well into
their 90s and he intends to do at least as well.
   ``I've made a rather Faustian pact with the devil,'' he
deadpans. ``I'll be ready to go two days after I finish my last
project. But you see I've left myself quite an open back door.''
   Kane and a lady friend spend two weeks every year at a Mexican
spa, where he relaxes, eats a vegetarian diet and boasts about the
fact that the ceilings are dusted twice a day with feather dusters.
That compensates for the scorpions noted on the floor.
   Kane sees his tilting at the windmills of history as really a
fight for the underdog, the truly creative man or woman who never
made the history books because someone else had better public
relations skills.
   His favorite inventor and personal hero is William Hunt, an
inventor who died in 1859. It was he, says Kane, who invented the
sewing machine 12 years before Howe. Kane sees most of the true
inventors as pathetic figures and Hunt outclasses them all.
   His voice picks up even more life as he talks about Hunt.
   ``I've only given him half the credit to which he is entitled,
but when you read it you will cry. He had such a tough life.
Everybody said he was crazy, but he wasn't.''
   Hunt's story exemplifies one of Nathan's favorite sayings, one
he has on a placard: ``The person with a new idea is a crackpot _
until it succeeds.''
   ``The story will bring no one any money, but I think it will be
the most interesting biography you will ever read.''
   ``Or,'' adds the man who refuses ever to take himself too
seriously, ``it will sell six copies.''

   Basques will tell you their ancestors can be
traced back to the Middle Paleolithic age of about 70,000 years ago
and lived in the Pyrenees thousands of years bfore modern Europeans
arrived. The Basque language is unlike any other verbal
communication on Earth. And in the American West, thousands of
Basques are keeping alive ancient traditions.

<TEXT>
   From the lonely alpine grasslands of
Wyoming to the lively streets of San Francisco, American Basques
are celebrating a renaissance of ethnic traditions that trace back
to a Stone Age mystery.
   Throughout the western United States these hearty people who
hail from the Pyrenees Mountains along the border between France
and Spain have formed social clubs where they can speak their own
language, eat spicy chorizo sausages and sweetbreads drenched in
garlic, drink vinegary red wine and anisette coffee, and share a
heritage that has baffled scholars for centuries.
   About 75,000 to 100,000 Americans have Basque blood. Although
they are commonly referred to as Basques, they call themselves
`Eskualdunak,' and `Eskualherria' is the term for their native land.
   Most live in the West, blending into Elko and Mountain Home,
Bakersfield and Winnemucca, where they live as solid citizens and
patriots. They take great pride in claiming Basque sailors helped
discover the New World.
   ``About 20 of Christopher Columbus' crewmen were Bizcainos, or
Basque people,'' says Dr. Pat Bieter, a professor at Boise State
University in Idaho and an expert on Basque migration.
   South American hero Simon Bolivar and Ferdinand Magellan's first
mate, Juan Sebastian del Cano, were also Basques. Others came to
California from Mexico with Spanish explorers in the 1600s and
1700s.
   ``The real influx didn't begin until the middle of the last
century, with the gold rush,'' Bieter says. A move by disgruntled
California lawmakers to tax non-citizen miners prompted the Basques
to turn to agriculture in the rich Central Valley.
   Still tucked away in some slow-to-change Western neighborhoods,
usually near a railroad station where passenger trains don't stop
anymore, are a few Basque boarding houses. A century ago they were
filled with many young shepherds fresh off the boat, trying to get
a start in a strange new country.
   Each American Basque family is only one or two generations
removed from a patriarch who crossed America by train with only a
few coins in his pocket and a sign around his neck stating his
destination in English so the conductor could tell him where to get
off. Brothers followed brothers, cousins trailed cousins, to the
vast sheep range of the Great Basin where Basques took their wages
in old ewes and began building their own herds one animal at a time.
   From those fledgling flocks many Basques went on to acquire big
ranches and, in some cases, great wealth accumulated by frugal
living. Many native Basque women also came alone to America to work
in boarding houses and restaurants and marry the transplanted
shepherds.
   Two stereotypes of American Basques obscure their true
collective character today.
   One is a lingering romantic notion, both in their European
homeland on the Iberian Peninsula and in this country, that has
been fostered by books and movies. It portrays them as tranquil
farmers tending herds and flocks, drinking copious amounts of wine
from their leather pouches and singing sad songs.
   Voltaire described them as ``the people who dwell, or rather who
dance, at the foot of the Pyrenees.''
   ``We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts
along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all
white-plastered,'' wrote Ernest Hemingway in ``The Sun Also
Rises.'' ``In the Basque country the land all looks very rich and
green and the houses and villages look well-off and clean.''
   Bieter estimates that today as few as 10 percent of American
Basques are in the sheep business, the main reason their parents
and grandparents came to this country. Basques now are found at all
economic, educational and social levels, and include former
Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada and Idaho's Secretary of
State Pete Cenarrusa.
   The other stereotype of Basques stems from their nationalist
movement in their homeland, carried forward by ETA, a
violence-prone guerrilla group fighting for an independent Basque
nation for its 3.2 million people in an area about the size of
Maine.
   ``Just as American Jews feel they have two homelands, one here
and one in Israel, so many American Basques feel something like
that,'' says Bieter, an Irishman whose wife, Eloise, is a
first-generation American of Basque parents. ``Support for the
separatist group ETA among American Basques is minimal, but it is
there. That is why the North American Basque Organization (NABO)
has prohibited any political discussion or activity within its
group. It is too divisive to allow it.''
   Basques are united by distinct physical characteristics,
including a large incidence of type O blood with a high RH negative
factor, and a low proportion of type B blood. All Basques consider
themselves `noble,' because they were knighted as a nation for
services at the ancient battle of Las Navas de Tolosa.
   Because American Basques are so scattered in their adopted land,
they try hard to hold on to traditions which link them as an ethnic
entity. NABO was founded in 1974 to promote Basque culture and help
keep the language alive. Twenty local Basque clubs have been
organized in five states, the District of Columbia and Canada. They
range from the opulent San Francisco complex that employs a native
Basque chef to a small group of sheepherders that meets to play
cards and dance in Buffalo, Wyo.

   But longtime neighbors and non-Basque spouses believe it is
their zest for hard work and their scrupulous honesty that sets
them apart.
   ``Work has always been the way to recognition, the most
important element in Basque culture,'' Bieter says. ``Next comes
family, loyalty to relatives all the way past third cousins. And
then there is honesty. If you're caught being dishonest or lazy
your reputation is gone. Much of the Basque culture is based on
integrity.''
   American Basques, like their European relatives who run with the
bulls at the Festival of San Fermin at Pamplona, also love parties.
   Every summer NABO sponsors a festival of traditional singing and
dancing, feasting, and a special Basque Roman Catholic mass. The
two-day celebration is like a giant family reunion where Basques
renew friendships, throw off the cares of a modern, mostly urban
life, and show off their cooking, shepherding and musical talents.
   This year the festival attracted about 4,000 people to Buffalo,
doubling its population and helping local ranchers take their minds
off too much summer heat and no rain.
   Simon Iberlin, the local chairman who organized the event, is a
retired sheepman. With his black, deep-set eyes, high cheekbones,
olive skin, and strong torso, Iberlin looks 10 years younger than
his 66 years. He spent the festival hobbling on crutches because
he'd just broken his pelvis ``in an argument with a stubborn horse
who wanted to throw me off. I refused to go.''
   Like most Basques, Iberlin takes a strange sort of pride in the
mystery of Basque origins.
   ``It gives me a chance to come up with all kinds of theories
about where we came from,'' he says with a grin. ``Some people
think we come from the lost city of Atlantis. Others say we were
the first to be Christianized. Perhaps we came from the Caspian Sea
area in southern Russia. It's my theory that we are related to the
Irish. We have the same traits and customs, our farming practices
are identical and we have the same black moods.''
   Basques will tell you their ancestors can be traced back to the
Middle Paleolithic age of about 70,000 years ago and lived in the
Pyrenees thousands of years before modern Europeans arrived.
   Iberlin, like many older Basques whose parents were immigrants,
learned to speak the native language before English.
   Called ``Eskuara,'' the Basque language is considered
autochthonous _ original and isolated from any other verbal
communication on Earth. Legends claim it was spoken by Adam and
Eve, and that one of the Adamic-speaking sons of Noah settled in
the mountains before the confusion of tongues at the Tower of
Babel. Basques like to claim the Devil himself tried to learn it,
but after eavesdropping seven years behind a door, he gave up
knowing only the word ``bai,'' meaning yes. Perhaps, say the
storytellers, he even lost his teeth in the ordeal.
   The Rev. Jean-Pierre Etcheverry is a Catholic priest from Europe
who is serving three years as cleric to America's Basques. Based in
San Francisco, he drives thousands of miles to officiate at
weddings, funerals and festivals throughout the West. He was an
honored guest in Buffalo.
   ``The Basque community asked the church for its own priest and
the first one came over from Europe in 1960,'' Etcheverry says in
heavily accented English. ``I am the sixth priest to come. At first
it was very hard because I had no English and there were such long
travels. I try to serve 4,000 Basque families scattered all over
the place. But now I love it, it is a wonderful job, the people are
so wonderful. I am truly blessed.''
   Throughout the festival, the smoky air was rich with the scent
of sizzling sausage and lamb burgers cooking on grills. Some food
booths offered strong cheeses and course, dense Basque bread for
sale. Other stalls sold wool blankets and crafts, photographs of
sheep and shepherds, and Basque souvenirs imported from Europe.
   The festival's first day was highlighted by a Main Street parade
of antique sheep wagons.
   Nearly every wagon had been the canvas-covered, 11-by-6-foot
first home of an immigrant Basque couple. Many wagons were hauled
down from the nearby Big Horn mountains where they are still used
every summer as a shepherd's home while tending flocks.
   The last day of the gathering was devoted to God in the morning
and dogs in the afternoon. An outdoor mass in a log band shell, the
altar decorated with whiskey barrels overflowing with petunias, was
partly conducted in Basque. A brass band, its members dressed in
red, white and green costumes, trumpeted fanfares to herald
highlights. Next came a picnic and a sheepherding contest to choose
the best work dog.
   Dollie Iberlin, in her book ``The Basque Web,'' wrote of her
husband Simon's and his people's heritage:
   ``God was there every Sunday and always the sheep, the sheep.
The yearly cycles of shearing, lambing, docking, trailing, shipping
and breeding of sheep structured their lives. Money came in only
twice a year; but love, laughter, and practical duties filled their
lives. Their heritage left to their children ... is impressive.''

   A diamond, the largest flawless stone and
second-largest diamond in the world, goes on sale 10 days from now
in New York, probably to fetch the largest price ever at auction.
But the origins of this magnificent stone remain a mystery. The
present owners won't say where they got it.

   It came from the earth into unknown hands
perhaps five to 10 years ago, crusted, dirty, with no hint to the
untrained eye of the golden heart inside. It was likely born in the
depths of Africa, no one knows when, of demonical, prehistoric fire
and pressure.
   Now it has been denuded of the weathered coating and
imperfections that cloaked its beauty, and on Oct. 19, at
Christie's in New York, the highest bidder will own a flawless,
golden diamond of 407.48 carats, the largest flawless diamond in
the world, the second-largest diamond in human hands, worth
whatever it will bring, probably more than $20 million.
   Its recent history is a mystery. Someone in Ghana or South
Africa or somewhere found it, brought it out and sold it to someone
else. It passed from knowing hand to knowing hand.
   ``It was mined by someone, someone who found the piece of rock,
only one person,'' says Francois Curiel, the dapper 39-year-old
Frenchman who heads Christie's jewelry department in New York. Then
it went out of South Africa, either by a private route or through
DeBeers, the huge diamond trust, or through another person.
   ``There must have been an intermediary,'' Curiel says. The
present owners will not even tell Christie's how they got it or how
much they paid. Curiel will not say how much it is insured for.
   ``Why $20 million?'' Curiel says. ``I don't know. The most
expensive diamond ever sold was about $10 million, but it was an
85-carat stone. This is not a white stone (which the previous
record-holder was), so you can't really compare it.''
   The world's largest diamond, the 530.20 carat Cullinan I, ``The
Great Star of South Africa,'' is set in Great Britain's Imperial
Sceptre, part of the Crown Jewels, and therefore out of
circulation, on display at The Tower of London.
   ``We don't believe the Cullinan is flawless,'' Curiel says. It
was cut in 1911, and the field of gemology was more art than
science. Now things are more precise, more scientific. ``Nobody
knows whether it is flawless or not.''
   Christie's counts on the fingers of both hands the number of
potential buyers, those with the money and the reason to sport such
a stone.
   It will be, Curiel says, ``someone who wants the prestige of
buying the largest flawless stone in the world ... either for a
corporate seal, or a scepter or for a tiara. I do not believe it
will be purchased by someone who will give it to his wife.'' It
will be a symbol of status.
   Christie's has taken the diamond on the road to show prospective
buyers, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Los Angeles, London.
   ``I don't travel with it,'' Curiel says. ``I would be an obvious
target.''
   So this queen of gems travels with a personal carrier, sometimes
an armored service or in the company of three or four armed guards.
It depends where it is going. ``Every country poses a different
problem,'' Curiel says.
   Not so in the secure heart of Christie's. Curiel, who is also an
executive vice president and director of the firm, casually
interrupts a phone conversation and calls out, ``Diane, the diamond
please.''
   It arrives in Diane's hand in a small black box that doesn't fit
together properly. Inside it is nestled in a piece of often-used
tissue paper.
   It took three years, beginning in 1985, to cut the diamond from
the 890-carat stone in which it was mined. Diamond cutters do not
work by the hour, but by the carat.
   An artisan, Jacques Swaab, began the job. He worked for six
months determining the most economical shape, a shield or
``triolette,'' a complicated, asymmetrical triangular design more
than 2 inches long, about one and one-third inches wide and a
fraction over an inch deep. Curiel, who will conduct the auction,
points to a one quarter-inch facet and says, ``It probably took a
month to make that one cut.''
   The cutting was finished this year by another artisan, Hy
Kessler, and the diamond drew crowds on exhibit at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington.
   The final product fits easily in the palm of one's hand and
weighs about as much as a cigarette lighter.
   The current owners, New York jewelry dealers Marvin Samuels and
Louis Glick, in partnership with the Zale Corp., a retail chain
headquartered in Dallas, don't explain their reluctance to reveal
the diamond's origins.
   April of this year was a big month for diamonds. On April 19,
Sotheby's auctioned off an 85.91-carat white diamond for
$9,310,000. A day later Christie's sold a 52.59-carat stone for
$7,480,000, or a record per-carat price of $142,000 for a white
diamond. At that price per carat the new diamond would run over $57
million. But, as Curiel says, they can't be compared.
   In April 1987, he sold a rare red diamond, weighing less than a
carat for $880,000, an all-time per-carat record.
   Some 300 people will witness the auction, but the principal
bidders will probably be absent, relying on agents or phoned bids.
Understandable. They don't like that kind of celebrity, people
following them around, trying to sell them something else.
   But in all likelihood the buyer's name will be made public,
Curiel says. ``There's always a chance that the buyer's name will
become eternally linked to the gem _ it's an opportunity for
immortality.''

   Bees are buzzing around the Griffith Park
carousel where they are filming the first episode of NBC's
``Something Is Out There,'' a series about a Los Angeles homicide
detective and a beautiful alien from another planet who investigate
things that go bump in the night.
   Joe Cortese is the detective and Maryam D'Abo is the alien,
reprising their roles from the hit miniseries last May that gave
birth to the series. But the outer-space monster that D'Abo chased
in the miniseries has yielded to more down-to-earth, although
equally spooky, evils.
   ``It's not going to be a creature of the week show,'' Cortese
says. ``And it's not going to be another cop show or romantic
comedy. It'll have a supernatural element and our cases will be a
little more eerie.''
   The gaiety at the carousel is interrupted by the screams of a
young girl. She jumps off a horse as Cortese, flashing his
detective's badge, tries to stop her. She kicks him on the shin and
runs off into the park.
   ``In this episode the girl has telekinetic powers and she knows
something is going to happen,'' Cortese explains. ``Two renegade
intelligence agents are after her because her father invented a
serum that gives her these powers. They want to sell it to the
highest bidder.''
   Cortese plays Detective Jack Breslin and D'Abo is Ta'ra. In the
fall series she will be earthbound, but is still an alien with
special powers. The miniseries, which topped ABC's ``Bourne
Identity'' and CBS' ``The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' in the
ratings, is now being packaged as a movie for theatrical release in
Europe and for videocassette release here.
   ``There's going to be a lot of humor between this man and
woman,'' Cortese says. ``She'll help him solve the cases with her
power. There'll be bantering and some sexual tension between them,
but that's it. They'll never get together.''
   Cortese shoos away a honey bee attempting to take a swig of his
soft drink. Then, director Richard Colla (who also did the
miniseries) calls him back for another take beneath the roof of the
merry-go-round, which was built in 1932 for the San Diego World's
Fair and moved to Griffith Park in 1936.
   Later, in his trailer dressing room, Cortese says, ``Breslin is
a guy with a cynical sense of humor. He can make fun of himself,
but he won't let anyone else make fun of him. He's a diamond in the
rough. We're trying to do a different show. Every kind of story you
can do in a cop show's been done. So, we're taking a risk. It's a
new arena and it could be a hit or a miss.''
   Cortese has had his share of misses. He starred in the NBC movie
``C.A.T. Squad,'' which came a cropper two years ago. He also stars
in the forthcoming ``C.A.T. Squad II Python Wolf.'' He was also in
such movies as ``Monsignor'' and ``Windows.''
   ``I've been in this business a long time and I've never been in
a hit,'' he says. ``I have been in a series of flops. When this
came on last May I never thought it would do as well as it did. It
was up against some tough competition, but it came out on top. I
was pleasantly surprised.''
   Before the miniseries came on people compared it to ``V,'' which
became an NBC series in 1984-85 after two successful miniseries. It
was about the conquest of Earth by lizard-like space aliens.
   ``This is much more accessible to the audience than `V,'''
Cortese says. ``The audience is going to like this guy and girl.
After people saw the miniseries they started comparing it to
`Moonlighting.' I think it stands on its own.''
   Cortese met Kim Delaney when she played his girlfriend in the
miniseries. ``I'm absolutely crazy about her,'' he says. ``It's the
best relationship I've been in. I didn't want to be in a
relationship with an actress, but when I met her that was it.''
   Cortese grew up in Paterson, N.J., but attended Midwestern
College in Denison, Iowa. ``It was a cultural shock,'' he says,
``but a great learning experience. I had to get away from my roots
and find out who I was.''
   He began acting his sophomore year of college and after
graduation worked in many regional theaters in the Midwest.
   Cortese admits he was discouraged by the flops in his career.
   ``But about four or five years ago I decided I wasn't going to
blame myself for it,'' he says. ``I worked hard to change myself. I
stopped drinking. I started working with more unfortunate people. I
donated my time to help other people. I took therapy. And when I
did that, little by little it changed me and I had a better life.''

   When Karen Curlee and her two sisters used to
sing as the Curlee Sisters, their mother had dreams of their
becoming as famous as Lawrence Welk's Lennon Sisters. But it was
the '60s and girl groups were passe.
   But one decade's passe is a later decade's nostalgia. Today
Karen Curlee is one of the four singing actresses appearing in
``The Taffetas,'' an off-Broadway hit at the Cherry Lane Theater.
   They play four rather naive, singing sisters living in Muncie,
Ind., in the 1950s and making an out-of-town appearance as a group
called the Taffetas.
   ``We're not a slick girls group,'' Curlee says. ``We haven't
gotten that far.''
   Curlee, at 34, and her ``sister'' Taffetas are too young to
remember when songs like ``Mockin' Bird Hill'' (Patti Page),
``Ricochet'' (Teresa Brewer), ``Mr. Sandman'' (Chordettes),
``Dedicated to the One I Love'' (Shirelles), and ``Sincerely''
(McGuire Sisters cover of a Moonglows hit), were on ``The Hit
Parade.''
   Audiences at the Cherry Lane range from people who do remember
those songs with nostalgia to younger listeners curious about what
was pop just before rock to girls admiring the Taffetas' prom
dresses.
   The other Taffetas are Tia Speros of San Francisco, Jody
Abrahams of Chicago, and Melanie Mitchell of Hartford, Conn.
   Mitchell has sung in a show set in the 1940s, playing Patti
Andrews of the Andrews Sisters. On TV she has been Angela, a rich
girl who got into drugs, on ``Another World'' and Judy, a mean
high-school cheerleader, on ``As the World Turns.''
   Curlee, from Fresno, Calif., became a Taffeta just before the
Cherry Lane Theater opening in August, when Susan Carson left to
play Grizabella, the ``Memory'' cat, in ``Cats'' in Vienna. Curlee
had been understudying five cats in ``Cats'' on Broadway for two
years.
   ``The Taffetas'' is the brainchild of Rick Lewis, who's onstage
playing piano at the Cherry Lane with two other musicians.
   Researching '50s music, he was amazed to find Doris Day's record
of ``A Bushel and a Peck.'' ``I thought my mother made that up to
put the kids to sleep.''
   Now he's working on four-part harmony for ``Santa Baby,'' an
Eartha Kitt hit 34 years before Madonna recorded it, to insert into
the show before Christmas.
   He thought of the name, a takeoff on the Chiffons, then the
image, the McGuire Sisters.
   ``They captured what the '50s singing group was like _ gorgeous,
great teeth and smiles and they sang incredibly,'' he says.
   The Taffetas aren't singing note-for-note the '50s arrangements.
``But if you don't hear something that sounds like what you
remember,'' Lewis says, ``you can't really remember it.''
   Lewis also picked the Taffetas' hometown, Muncie, Ind., a place
none of the quartet ever has been. He visited there, for journalism
seminars, from his high school in Dayton, Ohio.
   The Taffetas have been written about recently on Page 1 of the
Muncie Star, under the headline, ``Natives of a Town They Never
Knew.'' ``We're giving everybody from Muncie free tickets to see
the show, if they can prove it,'' Curlee says.
   In college, Lewis studied music education, then did some acting
and musical directing. He moved to New York thinking he'd pursue
both. He included on his resume his Ohio musical directing credits.
He got offered musical directing jobs, often for industrial shows.
   ``I'd build shows from scratch. They would spend $50,000 and it
would be performed one night. I did a show that was $100,000 a few
years ago.'' Trying for a reuseable, cheaper approach, he put
together the Taffetas.
   ``We kept showcasing it for people who book those things. The
amount of people we fed and gave booze to over a two-year period _
I'd like to spend that much on parties for my friends sometime.
They'd say, `When you've got reviews, let us know.'''
   So Lewis took the Taffetas into two New York cabarets, Don't
Tell Mama and Westbeth Cabaret Theater. ``I thought we'd put a nice
little brochure together. Instead we got fabulous reviews. We were
chased by producers wanting us off-Broadway. We made the best
choice. We took Arthur Whitelaw.''
   Since ``The Taffetas'' is an off-Broadway hit, there are offers
for industrial shows, conventions and parties.
   Asked what they think about the 1950s songs they're singing,
Speros says, ``They have an underlying sweet, smiling quality.''
   Curlee says, ``They sang much slower then. My inner tempo as a
34-year-old woman is to lock in much faster.''
   Mitchell says, ``Being slower, you can understand the lyrics.
Not having angst in the voice makes a more vulnerable, innocent and
youthful sound. I think this music grows on you. For me, it does.''
   Abrahams says, ``I love the lyrics. I think `I Cried' (Patti
Page) is one of the most beautiful songs. It pulls on those
heartstrings.''
   The Taffetas were photographed with Patti Page when she sang
recently at a New York nightspot. ``She does a lot of our songs,''
Lewis says with a smile.

<HEAD>Despite Anti-American Outbursts, Asians Still Look to United
States</HEAD>

   While some demonstrators shout ``Yankee
go home,'' vastly more Asians want just the opposite _ a continued
strong economic and political American presence in their region.
   A pervading fear is that the United States indeed might adopt a
new isolationist mood, leaving Asia prey to more agressive and
military powers.
   Despite sharp anti-American protests in South Korea and the
Philippines and festering disputes on trade issues, experts and
officials believe the United States has rarely enjoyed such broadly
based popularity in Asia as it does today.
   U.S. and Chinese leaders huddle regularly. Traditionally prickly
relations with India are on the mend, and onetime enemy Vietnam is
keen to establish diplomatic ties.
   On many days Filipino demonstrators are outnumbered by those
lined up at the U.S. Embassy in Manila for visas to emigrate or
study in the United States.
   In Burma, tens of thousands of demonstrators trying to topple an
authoritarian government have applauded the American flag in
rallies outside the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon.
   Published material and interviews by The Associated Press with
officials in various Asian countries indicate that a large
cross-section of Asians are apprehensive that the Soviet Union, and
foreseeably China and Japan, would fill the vacuum left by a
shrinking U.S. presence.
   ``The U.S. role in the western Pacific is vital to the security
and stability of non-communist Asia ... and is very much in
Singapore's national interest,'' said Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
of Singapore. Although speaking shortly after a U.S. diplomat was
expelled last May for allegedly meddling in Singapore's affairs,
Lee described U.S. power as ``benevolent, benign.''
   In a sharp turnabout from the Vietnam War era, American
officialdom finds itself trying to persuade Asians that the United
States is not becoming isolationist-minded.
   ``I think the unease is with American will and commitment: `Does
the U.S. really have the will to hold tough and stand?''' U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur said in an interview.
   Some senior U.S. foreign policy makers privately express
disappointment that the United States is not taking full advantage
of pro-American sentiments in Asia. They maintain that private
American business doesn't try hard enough in Asian markets, that
U.S. lawmakers create a backlash by pushing protectionist trade
legislation and that Washington doesn't spend enough to promote
general American interests.
   ``We have to grasp the moment,'' Sigur said.
   What also worries Washington is that the two hotbeds of
anti-Americanism in Asia happen to be strategically vital.
   In the Philippines, demonstrators demand the ouster of America's
largest military bases outside the continental United States.
   In South Korea, radicals blame the division of the Korean
peninsula on the presence of 42,000 U.S. troops in their country.
   ``If Filipinos want to grow up they have to slay the American
father image,'' said Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus of the
Philippines. He was referring to the Philippines' former status as
a U.S. colony.
   Last year, President Corazon Aquino discontinued
Philippine-American Friendship Day on July 4 as a national holiday.
   Analysts generally agree the majority in both the Philippines
and South Korea remain staunchly pro-American but say this
sentiment could erode if opponents are effective in propagating
their message and moderates find the anti-American theme
politically useful.
   Although the United States also stations troops in Japan,
irritants in that bilateral relationship are largely economic.
   ``Our leverage with Japan is declining so we have to use
Japan-bashing to achieve things, and this is causing a backlash,''
said Kent Calder, a Japan specialist at Princeton University in the
United States.
   Although he and others characterize all-around ties as sound,
Japanese farmers have staged demonstrations and burned an
American-made car _ one cattle farmer even committed suicide _ to
protest the opening of their market to far cheaper U.S. beef and
oranges. Americans in turn, see Japanese imports swelling an
already large U.S. trade deficit.
   The U.S. market absorbs more than half the manufactured goods of
non-communist Southeast Asia. Eastern Asia accounted for $107
billion, or 62 percent, of the U.S. trade deficit last year.
   Given such high economic stakes, countries such as Taiwan,
Indonesia and Thailand can be badly hurt by protectionist U.S.
legislation. Conversely, the United States becomes a highly favored
friend when a country's products flow unhindered into U.S. shopping
malls and showrooms.
   Anti-American feeling appears to be proportional to the
intensity of direct U.S. involvement, especially military, in an
Asian country.

   The State Department's Sigur ascribed the South Korean
demonstrations to ``Korean nationalism reacting to the visible
presence of another nation's soldiers. This sort of problem is
difficult to eradicate entirely.''
   However, this very military muscle is welcomed by much of the
rest of Asia, including China, which continues to have shaky
relations with Moscow while building what U.S. diplomats call a
``solid, mature, many-sided'' relationship with Washington.
   The Soviet Union is entrenched at Vietnam's Cam Ranh Bay, its
largest military base outside the homeland, and enjoys a close
alliance with Vietnam.
   Moscow has also made political and economic inititatives since
1986 when General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared in
Vladivostok in Soviet Asia that the ``Soviet Union is also an Asian
Pacific country.'' Recently he offered to pull out of Cam Ranh Bay
if the United States terminated its air and naval stations in the
Philippines.
   ``The real, long-term and very difficult obstacle to remove is
not the American bases but the Soviet bases and military
alliance,'' the head of Malaysia's Institute for Strategic and
International Studies, Noordin Sopiee, wrote this year.
   Asians are also noting that Japan has become the world's fifth
largest spender on defense and is taking a more aggressive role in
international politics. In countries like Indonesia, South Korea,
China and the Philippines, Japanese atrocities in World War II are
far from forgotten.
   ``What kind of a leader is Japan when it worries more about
selling transistors than human rights?'' asked an Indonesian
intellectual, remarking that unlike the U.S. Embassy, the Japanese
mission in Jakarta shuns opposition figures for fear of losing the
government's favor _ and business.
   Princeton's Calder said, ``In comparison with the Japanese
juggernaut the U.S. superpower is more appealing to many Asians. .
.. There are a lot of people after Vietnam who see the U.S. as more
distant, the lesser evil if you will. They balance the generosity
of the Americans with the mercantilism, the strategic approach of
Japan.''
   To offset what many Asians call Japan's ``economic invasion,''
they urge the United States to increase its trade, aid and
investment in Asia. The Japanese have outpaced the United States in
all three in recent years. Official development assistance by Japan
to Asian countries in 1987 was $3.4 billion in contrast to less
than $900 million from Washington.
   U.S. policy makers also say the democratic wave that has in
recent years swept the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and now
Burma, along with the economic failures of Asia's communist
societies, are in the U.S. interest.
   The emerging democracies, they say, are not only closer to the
U.S. system and spirit but also eliminate the earlier dilemma of
the United States propping up right-wing, anti-communist dictators.
This had been a source of anti-Americanism in the past.

<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After centuries at the center of a
tug-of-war between Germany and France, this city nestled on a
tranquil river now harmonizes French joie de vivre with German
efficiency.
   ``Strasbourg is a symbol,'' says Deputy Mayor Germain Muller,
who is in charge of the celebrations marking the city's 2,000th
anniversary this year. ``France and Germany, which often fought
over this place, are now the countries leading us toward a united
Europe.''
   Pope John Paul II will spend four days, beginning Oct. 8, in
this city between West Germany's Black Forest and France's Vosges
Mountains. He will address the entity that symbolizes European
unity, the European Parliament, which meets in the chambers of the
Council of Europe.
   In coming to Strasbourg, the pope will not find a better place
to illustrate reconciliation _ an appropriate theme at a time when
the Roman Catholic Church in the area is shaken by a traditionalist
schism.
   Memories of the Nazi occupation are fresh enough to cause
Strasbourgeois, as the local people are called, to feel
passionately French.
   Taxi drivers boast that the French national anthem, the
Marseillaise, was written here. Shopkeepers mention that Napoleon
Bonaparte came here to go to school. The city is still the biggest
university town in eastern France.
   They mention less often, however, that Goethe studied here, too,
or that Johann Gutenberg spent a decade in Strasbourg inventing the
intricate press on which he later produced his Bible, the first
book printed with movable type.
   For centuries Alsace and the neighboring region of Lorraine were
part of an independent republic bordering the Rhine River. From
1870 to 1945, the region passed regularly back and forth between
German and French hands.
   The bicultural history is felt today in nearly every aspect of
daily life _ from the bildings on the street to the music on the
radio. Even the names of city streets reveal Strasbourg's seesaw
history.
   In 1871, Avenue Napoleon became Kaiser Wilhelmstrasse, after the
Germans moved in. That was changed to Boulevard de la Republique
after World War I. Then for some years it was known as Adolf Hitler
Strasse until it was given its current name, Avenue Charles de
Gaulle, when the French reclaimed the city at the end of World War
II.
   The avenue today is filled with a blitzkrieg of German tourists
who arrive by the busload in this city of 400,000, just two miles
from the West German border. They are outnumbered only by French
sightseers who stroll through the narrow, medieval streets of
half-timbered houses, past outdoor cafes and hidden courtyards and
over picturesque bridges on the Ill River.
   Many people speak both German and French, and older people often
are fluent in Alsatian, the regional linguistic hybrid.
   The intertwining of cultures has produced a cuisine that melds
German ingredients and French know-how to cook up regional dishes
like choucroute _ sauerkraut and smoked meat cooked in wine.
Kronenbourg beer is brewed here. Rhine wines, in a dry French
style, are produced nearby.
   Cuisines and languages have blended with ease; the region's two
religions have not. Unlike most of France, which is 80 percent
Roman Catholic, Alsace-Lorraine is half Protestant.
   ``When a Protestant girl married a Catholic boy here it used to
be considered a disgrace. Except for a very few small villages,
it's not that way anymore,'' said City Councilman Gilbert Roos,
whose father was a medical officer in the German army in World War
I and in the French army in World War II.
   Roos said the two groups now live in harmony. The discord these
days is within the Catholic church itself.
   In June, a long-brewing dispute between the Vatican and Catholic
traditionalists culminated in the excommunication of rebel
Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. It was the first schism within the
Roman Catholic Church in more than a century and has led to
repeated calls by the French hierarchy for unity in the face of the
challenge posed by Lefebvre and his flock.
   As he did on a trip to France two years ago, Pope John Paul is
likely to stress loyalty to Rome on this visit, which begins at
Strasbourg's massive cathedral, a dramatic setting for the pope's
first speech.
   Built between 1190 and 1489 by master French and Rhineland
craftsmen, the pink sandstone cathedral rises 465 feet and was the
highest building in the Christian world until a century ago.
   Inside is an astronomical clock of ingenious works. At 12:30
each afternoon a bell is struck by a figure representing Death,
while the 12 Apostles receive the blessing of Christ and a cock,
beating its wings, crows three times in memory of Peter's denial.
   A perpetual calendar on the clock calculates the phases of the
moon, solar eclipses and rising and setting of the sun.
   While here, the pope also will speak at both the European
Parliament and Council of Europe.
   The presence of these two European institutions has stirred the
ambitions of some local boosters.
   ``It is not surprising the pope is coming here,'' said Roos.
``One day we won't be just another beautiful city. Someday we will
be the capital of Europe.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Stealing Home''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   From Elia Kazan's ``America, America'' to John Boorman's ``Hope
and Glory,'' remembrance of childhood has made stirring films. They
require selective memory and an artistic soul. Those factors,
unfortunately, are missing in ``Stealing Home.''
   Steven Kaupmann and Will Addis, sitcom writers who graduated to
such features as ``Back to School'' and ``The Couch Trip,'' thought
it would be a dandy idea to write a movie script based on their
experiences of growing up in the 1960s _ not only write it, but
direct it. Together.
   Despite good performances and one that is exceptional,
``Stealing Home'' becomes a mishmash, chaotic in structure and full
of momentous scenes that don't come off.
   The title itself is a misguided attempt at allegory.
   The biggest moment in Billy Bryant's young life was stealing
home in a crucial baseball game. The moment is replayed at the end
of the film to illustrate the regeneration of the adult Billy, now
trying for a minor league comeback. Even with all the slo-mo
effects and the portentous music, the scene has no more impact than
a third-base bunt.
   The movie opens with Mark Harmon, the adult Billy Bryant, on the
skids. We know he's on the skids because he is swilling booze with
a bimbo in a third-rate motel and sports a Don Johnson stubble. He
learns that his boyhood friend and lover, Katie Chandler (Jodie
Foster), has committed suicide and has designated him to dispose of
her ashes.
   Thus begins Billy Bryant's pilgrimage to his old home grounds
and into his past. This requires a procession of flashbacks to
Billy's happy family, his baseball prowess, his father's untimely
death, the strong friendship with the eccentric Katie.
   There might have been a heartwarming film in these
reminiscences, but the time frames are juxtaposed confusingly, and
there are even flashbacks within flashbacks. The star of the film,
Mark Harmon, appears in about a half-hour of footage, the teen-age
Billy being played quite effectively by William McNamara.
   Jodie Foster has the role of her young life, and she plays it
brilliantly. She captures the quicksilver qualities of Katie,
dominating the screen whenever she appears. Within the constraints
of his role, Harmon performs ably, but the reasons for his torment
are never made clear.
   The Warner Bros. release was produced by Thom Mount and Hank
Moonjean. The rating is PG-13 for language and sexual content.

   ``Broadcast News'' (CBS-Fox Video; VHS@Beta, $89.98; Rated R)
   
   One advantage in seeing ``Broadcast News'' at home is the
opportunity to give the film a more satisfying ending than the
feeble conclusion reached by director James L. Brooks. Just stop
when you've had enough _ at least two good opportunities will arise
_ and savor the satisfaction of saving a film in the cutting room.
   For most of its length, though, ``Broadcast News'' is a witty
and often hilarious human comedy set in the high-pressure world of
network journalism. This highly praised film inexplicably was
snubbed at the Academy Award ceremonies, after winning seven
nominations. However, Holly Hunter deservedly won best-actress
awards from critics in New York and Los Angeles.
   Hunter and Albert Brooks play bright, dedicated and tough news
professionals who worry about the inroads of fluffy feature stories
and blow-dried airheads on the anchor desk. We know they are the
very best of journalists because they say so, rather often.
   Their media Eden is invaded by a blow-dried, airhead snake named
Tom Grunick (William Hurt). However, Tom establishes himself as a
sympathetic figure. He's the only character who appears to have any
humility, admitting that he's no genius and forthrightly asking
help from Jane Craig (Hunter). What he knows is how to look good
and sound smart, and he generously offers tips on anchoring to
Aaron Altman (Brooks) _ perhaps knowing that the neurotic Aaron is
no competition.
   Jane runs at such a high pitch that she often loses perspective.
When her boss sarcastically tells her that it must be great to
always be the smartest person in the room, she takes him seriously.
``No, it's awful,'' she sobs.
   Though Brooks and Hurt turn in first-class performances, this is
Holly Hunter's movie and it runs on her energy. It's not just the
two guys in the film who will fall in love with her.

   ``Switching Channels'' (RCA@Columbia; VHS@Beta, $89.95; Rated PG)
   
   ``Switching Channels,'' a film of romantic antics in a satellite
TV station, had the bad luck of appearing in movie houses last
March several months after ``Broadcast News,'' a far better satire
of the TV news business.
   But let's be fair. Don't compare ``Switching Channels'' to
``Broadcast News,'' or to classics on the same newsroom theme from
which it was derived: ``The Front Page'' and ``His Girl Friday.''
   No, ``Switching Channels'' is so silly, predictable, miscast and
lost in its lame attempt at broad comedy that a more apt comparison
would be to ``Francis the Talking Mule.''
   Kathleen Turner plays an ace reporter at a Chicago TV station.
Burt Reynolds is her boss and ex-husband. Turner takes a vacation
and meets Christopher Reeve, a wealthy New York manufacturer of
sporting goods including, ha ha, jockstraps. They fall in love, and
Turner agrees to go East and leave Burt and the news biz behind.
   Wily Burt is having none of that. He hooks Turner into covering
one last big story, the execution of a convicted cop killer, played
by Henry Gibson.
   When it's all over, and Turner must decide between Reeve and
Reynolds, the only question becomes how could someone supposedly so
smart wind up torn between such a pair of shnooks? And do you
really care which she choses?
   Turner does the most with limp material. Reynolds, usually very
good in such broad comedy, never gets started here. Reeve, who
showed flashes of drollery as Superman, is miserably miscast as a
foppish, brainless rich boy who's scared of elevators.
   Director Ted Kotcheff seems willing to let the actors drift and
mug pretty much as they will.
   ``Switching Channels'' is rated PG for occasional tart language.

   ``Chimes of Freedom'' (Columbia Records) _ Bruce Springsteen
   
   This extended play recording was released to coincide with the
six-week Human Rights Now! global tour now under way featuring
Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel and a host of other
musicians, with some of the EP's proceeds donated to the human
rights group Amnesty International.
   The disc's four songs were all recorded live during
Springsteen's 1988 ``Tunnel of Love'' tour; the opening ``Tougher
Than the Rest'' already appears on that album. This live version,
recorded at the Los Angeles Sports Arena, has a slower, more
country-tinged tempo to it, and wraps up nicely with fine harmonica
work by Springsteen.
   ``Be True,'' recorded at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, is what
Springsteen fans would call typical ``B Side Bruce.'' The artist
has a penchant for putting catchy, danceable tunes on the flip
sides of his singles that aren't included on any album.
   Backed, as always, by the hard-rocking E Street Band,
Springsteen croons to the fictional heroine, ``You be true to me
and I'll be true to you.'' Isn't it kind of tacky for Springsteen,
whose split with wife Julianne Phillips made all the gossip columns
during his tour, to include this song here?
   Incidentally, vocals by back-up singer Patti Scialfa, with whom
Springsteen is now involved, are far more prominent on this EP than
on any previous recording.
   ``Chimes of Freedom,'' the third song, is alone worth buying
this EP for. The Bob Dylan protest song is the perfect anthem for
the Amnesty International tour, and Springsteen's rendering,
recorded in Stockholm, Sweden, is faithful to the original. The
artist, whose lyrics were often compared to Dylan's early in his
career, proves he can salute his influences and still add something
uniquely his own to their songs.
   By far the most ambitious of the four songs is Springsteen's
acoustic version of ``Born to Run,'' also recorded in Los Angeles.
That song was the artist's signature tune before being replaced by
``Born in the USA,'' and it had the raw power of a motorcycle
opened up at full throttle.
   However, Springsteen, who has proven himself an accomplished
accoustic artist with ``Nebraska'' and several cuts on ``Tunnel of
Love,'' falls flat here. His vocals meander all over the place like
a Leonard Cohen prose-poem and the impression is one of the
motorcycle run out of gas and being pushed along like a scooter.

   ``Still Live'' (ECM) _ Keith Jarrett Trio
   
   Jazz pianist Keith Jarrett, who unlike many of his
electronic-minded contemporaries still plays only the piano, has
never sounded better than in this two-disc live recording.
   Communicating intuitively with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer
Jack DeJohnette, Jarrett combined his signature moody chord
voicings with sharp improvising in a collection of jazz standards
for a concert audience in Munich, West Germany.
   He took the songs' familiar melodies and stretched, twisted and
bent them in fascinating ways. The listener is never lost, though,
and he ends each journey back at the beginning, exhilarated and
ready for another.
   Jarrett's interpretation of ``My Funny Valentine'' was
understated and sensitive, while ``When I Fall in Love'' became a
ballad with a bit of an attitude.
   ``Come Rain or Come Shine'' had just the right bluesy edge. Only
``The Song Is You,'' a Kern-Hammerstein composition, failed to
achieve a groove that matched its length, nearly 17 minutes.
   Keith Jarrett is an intelligent pianist who has done his share
of experimenting. ``Still Live,'' with its classic tunes played on
acoustic piano, should give purists plenty to cheer about.

   ``Day By Day'' (EMI-Manhattan) _ Najee
   
   Najee sets a mellow groove on his second LP, ``Day By Day,'' and
never strays very far from the course.
   The album is always tasteful, with the New Yorker's soaring
saxophone solos taking center stage and showing his jazz and rhythm
and blues influences. Back-up singers dart in and out of the
arrangements, keeping things moving along smoothly.
   But the album tends to be swallowed up by its tastefulness, and
often fades into backround music. While this album can be the
perfect accompaniment to a romantic dinner, it unfortunately is
just as appropriate later on when the dishes are being washed.
   Only ``Najee's Nasty Groove,'' a funky track dominated by drums
and synthesizer, breaks the mold.
   Anyone in the market for some easy listening jazz could do worse
than this album. But those looking for something more, well,
inspiring, would do well to keep on looking.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Sigourney Weaver's African Adventure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sigourney Weaver has been known as a
courageous actress. But as the late naturalist Dian Fossey in
``Gorillas in the Mist,'' she has outdone herself.
   In earlier films she battled outer space demons (``Alien,''
``Aliens''), revolution (``The Year of Living Dangerously'') and
evil spirits (``Ghostbusters''). The new movie shows her in
conditions of genuine peril: working with silverback gorillas in
the mountain jungles of Rwanda without a double or net _ nothing
between her and a beast that could crush her in an instant.
   Fossey was murdered in Rwanda in her sleep. Her colleagues, who
considered her an eccentric, said she had angered local residents
with her aggressive efforts to restrict poaching.
   Weaver, 38, was born into the entertainment business. Her father
is Sylvester (Pat) Weaver, the NBC president considered to be the
architect of modern television. Her mother is the former actress
Elizabeth Inglis. After Stanford University and the Yale School of
Drama, she worked her way from off-Broadway to films.
   On a recent visit from her New York home, she talked about her
African experience in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Q. You don't pick easy pictures, do you?
   A. (laughing) That's probably true. My father says that if I
open a script and it takes place in Alaska with a lot of huskies
and I fall through the ice, I'll probably do it instead of a lovely
picture on the French Riviera.
   Q. Did you know about Dian Fossey and her work?
   A. I had gotten her book when it first came out. I had also been
at Stanford when they started that human-primate program where you
could live with an ape in your trailer and do your thesis on it.
Jane Goodall had come and spoken to us.
   After I read Dian's book (``Gorillas in the Mist'') I thought,
``They can't make a picture out of this; she is too difficult a
woman to be portrayed on the screen.'' I also thought logistically
it would be a nightmare. How could you possibly create the whole
atmosphere of the gorillas?
   Q. Were you involved in the joining of Universal and Warner
Bros. (which had competing projects)?
   A. No. I was approached by each studio separately. By the time
(producer) Arnie Glimcher approached me for Universal, I said,
``Arnie, I don't want to get involved with a picture that's not
going to happen.'' I thought they would knock each other out.
   Q. Once the deal was made, weren't you overwhelmed by the danger
involved?
   A. Not really. I was reading a lot of Dian's papers and
rereading her book, and it seemed that she was often threatened by
gorillas, but they never actually hurt her. It was all a question
of getting to know each other.
   I didn't see why they would feel animosity toward me. That was a
lucky choice on my part. I don't think it would be wise go in and
to work with animals without having previously reassured yourself
that you would be all right.
   I was intimidated by trying to gather all the information about
Dian. So much of it was conflicting. And so much of it was hearsay.
She had a very negative reputation within her field, and she was
considered to be a very difficult woman. I heard people say some
pretty hard things about her. And some very loving things as well.
   Q. What kind of a person was she?
   A. She was a mass of opposites, I think. Everything you can say
about Dian, the opposite is probably true. She loved people, she
loved partying. ... On the other hand she shunned people, she
preferred to be with animals. She lived up in this isolated place,
tramping around in mud, yet she loved to go out in fancy clothes.
She always slept with curlers in her hair, even when she lived up
on top of the mountain.
   She is such an amazing collection of different things. I guess I
grew very fond of her. I was lucky to have access to her letters
and her camp notes through a colleague of hers. She really put
herself in those letters. I developed such an admiration for her
thoroughness, her commitment, her humor _ she was always making
jokes about herself. She had a wicked sense of humor, and I hope
that comes across in the film.
   Q. Did you train for the rigors of the location?
   A. In the press release, it says I ran up these volcanic
mountains in Hawaii. (laughing) I don't know where they got that. I
did walk up a hill behind my parents-in-law's house in Hawaii every
morning for about two weeks. I don't think any of us could have
gotten in shape for (the location). You had to get used to the
altitude and slowly get used to the climbs. It was difficult for
everyone except the Australians; they were very macho about the
whole thing.
   You were in such a beautiful part of the world and you were
perhaps going to see gorillas at the end of the climb or you were
going to the top of the mountain to shoot a scene.
   Q. What was your first encounter with the gorillas?
   A. We didn't think we were going to see gorillas that day. It
turned out they were only 5 minutes away from Dian's camp. We took
off through a beautiful forest filled with wild orchids. We heard a
great outburst of pock-pock sounds, which is the sound they make
beating their chests. I looked up and saw this big gorilla standing
halfway up the hill.
   You're so amazed to suddenly be in their territory; it was like
you had walked into another era. I just forgot, I was so entranced.
It was like walking into a forest and seeing a unicorn. You forgot
your fear, you just went ahead.
   I went up to where they were all sitting around munching, though
I couldn't see them. This little gorilla came out to me and sat
down and touched my camera. She was very curious, taking me in in a
matter-of-fact way. She jumped away after she had visited, and I
was agog. It was an indescribable feeling.
   I just found out last week that that sweet little girl had been
caught in a poacher's trap ... and she didn't make it. There aren't
many females, and coming from a very good family, she would have
been a good mate.
   Q. Were you well-coached on how to behave with the gorillas?
   A. I kind of learned it as I went along. In the picture are a
couple of scary scenes where the silverback comes down right next
to me. They all happened the first times we went out. So I was kind
of thrown into the deep end.

<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The life's work of sculptor Henry Moore has gone
on show in London in a comprehensive way that was never managed
while he lived.
   ``We discussed an exhibition with him in 1984 to mark his 90th
birthday this year, but he died in 1986. Now this is his
memorial,'' said Roger de Grey, president of the Royal Academy of
Arts.
   The venerable academy, which has been presenting art exhibitions
since 1768, has done Moore proud, spreading 112 sculptures and 127
drawings by him through its 12 main galleries to show all the
stages of his career.
   There are Giant abstract bronzes and lifesize human figures in
stone that had to be lifted in by crane, and little plaster figures
smaller than a hand.
   His famous drawings of restless sleepers who sought refuge in
the London subway to escape bombings in World War II also are
shown, along with sketches of coal miners, trees, elephants, sheep,
landscapes and ideas for sculpture, often based on bones, stones
and bits of wood which he picked up.
   Dr. Susan Compton, a British art historian who organized a
popular exhibition of Marc Chagall at the Philadelphia Museum of
Art, spent 15 months arranging the exhibition, which ru a global thing.
That's
where the `Small World' concept came from.''
   The album's first single is the brassy ``Perfect World'' written
by Alex Call, a longtime friend of Lewis' who used to be in his old
country-rock band Clover.
   Lewis said the second single will be an edited version of
``Small World (Part One)'' and the instrumental ``Small World (Part
Two),'' which features a guest appearance by jazz saxophonist Stan
Getz.
   ``I once went to a benefit show with my dad, who's a jazz
drummer, and Stan came up and introduced himself to me,'' Lewis
recalled. ``He said, `Hey man, why don't you let me play on some of
your stuff? I can play that stuff, too.' Then he gave me a card
that said, `Stan Getz: Have Sax, Will Travel.'''
   Other album cuts are the 1960s-style soul instrumental
``Slammin','' the Cajun-sounding ``Old Antone's'' which features a
guest appearance by Bruce Hornsby on accordion, the reggae-tinged
love song ``Better Be True'' and the pure reggae jam ``Bobo Tempo.''
   ```Bobo Tempo' was written by Sean and myself about 13 years ago
when we were both in Clover,'' Lewis said. ``It was for a gig we
had in Bolinas, Calif. `Bobo' is a nickname for Bolinas, which is a
nutty place. We used to play out there every so often and there
would be huge street parties.
   ``We wrote the song just for that one gig, just for a laugh
really,'' he said. ``On the last day of the ``Fore!'' album
sessions (in 1986), we piled into the studio at midnight and cut
that song. The track really held up.''
   But not the video, which involves a topless girl, a surfer and a
horse on a surfboard and probably will never be commercially
released.
   The cleft-chinned Lewis, born Hugh Anthony Cregg III in New York
City, grew up near San Francisco and was known as ``Huey Louie''
when he joined Clover in 1972. He changed his name to Huey Lewis
when he formed his band in late 1979 with Hopper, 35, Hayes, 30,
and three members of the Bay Area group Soundhole _ Gibson, 36,
Cipollina, 33, and Colla, 36.
   The group originally was called Huey Lewis and The American
Express, but the name was quickly altered to avoid an infringment
lawsuit.
   Their self-titled first album in 1980 went nowhere, but the
follow-up ``Picture This'' in 1982 had the Top 10 hits ``Workin'
for a Livin''' and ``Do You Believe in Love.'' Next came the
landmark ``Sports'' album, which has sold 9 million copies since
its September 1983 release and won several Grammy Awards. It
spawned five Top 10 singles including ``I Want a New Drug'' and
``Heart of Rock & Roll.''
   In 1985, the band had its first No. 1 single with ``Power of
Love,'' an Oscar-nominated song recorded for the year's
largest-grossing movie, ``Back to the Future.''
   The tour will take Huey Lewis and The News well into 1989 and
mark their 10th anniversary together.
   ``I'd be surprised if we're not together another 10 years,''
Lewis said.
   ``But it's funny. I still remember when we got our first
paycheck from our manager, Bob Brown. I remember I told him, `I got
to have $150 a week for these guys. Otherwise, that's it.' It
doesn't seem that long ago.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Flannery O'Connor's Concern With Durable
Matters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stories of the late Flannery O'Connor are
best understood by what's left unsaid.
   ``She said that it was the mystery, what cannot be explained,
that made a story endlessly fascinating. She didn't feel that God's
ways were cut and dry. There were always some surprises in store
for everybody,'' said Sally Fitzgerald, a longtime friend of the
late writer who has edited O'Connor's ``Collected Works'' (Library
of America, $30)
   The anthology contains the Georgia native's novels, ``Wise
Blood'' and ``The Violent Bear It Away,'' as well as such short
stories as ``The Artificial Nigger'' and ``A Good Man Is Hard to
Find.'' Also included are essays and a large selection of letters.
   Mary Flannery O'Connor was born in Savannah in 1925, the only
child of Regina Cline and Edward Francis O'Connor, Jr.
   She began writing at an early age and set up an attic studio in
her home as a work place. One of her favorite books growing up was
``The Humorous Tales of Edgar Allan Poe.''
   She contributed cartoons and articles to her high school
newspaper and entered Georgia State College for Women in 1942.
While in college, she began signing her academic work ``Flannery
O'Connor.''
   In 1945, she received a scholarship in journalism from the
University of Iowa. She gained admission to the Writers' Workshop
where she began reading the works of James Joyce, Franz Kafka and
William Faulkner.
   ``She was influenced by the Workshop,'' Fitzgerald said. ``She
learned to spend a certain number of hours writing every day at the
same time. She let nothing interfere with it. She was very
disciplined about it.''
   O'Connor received a master of fine arts degree in 1947. That
same year, she began working on ``Wise Blood,'' her first novel. It
took five years and endless revisions before the book was published.
   ``She certainly suffered writing,'' Fitzgerald said. ``Writing
was very hard for her. She was a real perfectionist. She discarded
more than 2,000 sheets from `Wise Blood.'
   ``Ideas explored and abandoned. Working through inferences,
working through bad solutions to good solutions. Making that book
absolutely her own.''
   ``Wise Blood'' tells the story of Hazel Motes, an intense young
man who arrives in a small city in Georgia, determined to form a
``Church Without Christ.''
   In a letter dated March 2, 1954, O'Connor gave her own
interpretation of ``Wise Blood'':
   ```Wise Blood' is about a Protestant saint, written from the
point of view of a Catholic. ... First you must accept the fact
that this book is by someone who believes that there was a fall,
has been a Redemption, and will be a judgment. This is what I
believe as a Catholic and what I imply that Haze could not get away
from. ...''
   Man and God. The struggle against grace. Redemption. They were
the major themes of O'Connor's stories and her life.
   ``Redemption and incarnation was central to her,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``She thought of herself as writing from a Catholic point of
view. This is what all Catholics believe, everything has a
meaning.''
   Fitzgerald met O'Connor in 1949. ``She was quite silent. She
didn't talk a lot. She listened very carefully. If you were aware,
you realized you were in the presence of someone listening and
watching very carefully.''
   In O'Connor's stories, the eyes are often the most important
features of her characters' faces. Fitzgerald says the same was
true for O'Connor herself.
   ``She was a young girl, not particularly striking, until you
looked at her eyes, which were blue and penetrating. She was a
sandy-haired girl. Not somebody you would notice.''
   In 1950, O'Connor began to suffer pains and heaviness in her
arms and shoulder joints. Although at first she laughed off the
symptoms as psychosomatic, an excuse not to write, O'Connor was
eventually diagnosed as having lupus, an incurable disease that
eventually killed her in 1964.
   ``She bore it very well. We heard no complaints. She was quite
funny about it,'' Fitzgerald said.
   ``She had no idea what it was at first. When she learned how
serious it was, she must have been shocked. Her father had died of
the same disease. He died when she was 15.''
   Despite her weakened condition, O'Connor continued to work until
her death. She completed a second novel, published two collections
of short stories and was a prolific letter writer.
   She moved back to Georgia in 1950 and lived in Milledgeville
with her mother for the rest of her life.
   ``She believed in a character's capacity to change with grace,''
Fitzgerald said. ``She lived in the South, which was largely
Protestant. There were a number of do-it-yourself religions. She
was fascinated by what they would come up with.''
   In a 1957 essay, ``The Church and the Fiction Writer,'' O'Connor
summed up how religion shaped her writing:
   ``The Catholic writer, in so far as he has the mind of the
Church, will feel life from the standpoint of the central Christian
mystery; that it has, for all its horror, been found by God to be
worth dying for.
   ``When people have told me that because I am a Catholic, I
cannot be an artist, I have to reply, ruefully, that because I am a
Catholic, I cannot afford to be less than an artist.''
   Fitzgerald said O'Connor was concerned with ``durable matters.''
   ``These are the great questions that have concerned serious
artists throughout history,'' she said.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Keith Whitley Is Just Getting Started</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising country music performer Keith
Whitley says his career is just getting started even though he's
been singing on the road for 18 years.
   The 33-year-old singer hit the top of the country music charts
in August with the single ``Don't Close Your Eyes.'' The album of
the same name has been in the Top 10.
   ``We're at the point where all systems are go,'' said Whitley,
whose honky-tonk style of singing is traditional country music with
lyrics embracing pain and joy. ``That sounds odd for somebody who's
been on the road for (about) 20 years.''
   He was only 15 when he and friend Ricky Skaggs, a year older,
joined Ralph Stanley's Clinch Mountain Boys, a bluegrass band. Like
Whitley, Skaggs eventually became a solo country singer.
   Whitley then survived his remaining, reckless teen-age years and
battled a stubborn drinking problem to become one of country
music's emerging stars along with Randy Travis and Dwight Yoakam.
   ``I've been in this business for a long, long time,'' he said in
an interview. ``But from the musical standpoint and a personal
standpoint, we're really just at the beginning of my career.''
   As a carefree teen in Sandy Hook, Ky., he bought bootleg
bourbon, poured it down his thirsty throat and then enjoyed
challenging the rural roads at breathless speeds deep in Appalachia.
   ``Basically when I was growing up, the only thing we did for
pastime was go to bootleggers and get something to drink and ride
around and drink it and drive around and see how fast you could
take those mountain curves,'' he recalled.
   At age 17, he was in a car with a companion who attempted to
round a curve at 120 mph. The car wrecked, killing his friend.
   ``The doctor told me I came close to breaking my neck,'' said
Whitley, who was cut but not hurt in the accident.
   At 19, he drove off a 120-foot cliff into a frozen river,
escaping with a broken collarbone.
   ``There were a lot more less serious accidents and brushes with
the law,'' he said.
   But always, he was intrigued by music. He played with Stanley's
band on the weekends as a teen-ager and later was lead singer for
J.D. Crowe and the New South, a country-bluegrass band.
   After earning the reputation as a fine musician and singer, he
moved to Nashville in the mid-1980s and landed a recording contract
with RCA Records. His hits besides ``Don't Close Your Eyes''
include ``Miami My Amy,'' ``Ten Feet Away,'' ``Homecoming '63'' and
``Hard Livin.'''
   He quit drinking in 1987.
   ``It was a matter of life and death,'' he said. ``If I hadn't
stopped drinking, I don't think I'd be alive today. I did so many
crazy things while drinking.''
   Whitley, who is married to Grand Ole Opry singer Lorrie Morgan,
said his lifestyle intensified his music.
   ``Not to sound conceited, but I've lived, breathed and cried
this music since I was 3 or 4 years old,'' Whitley said. ``I take
it very seriously. Most of the things I sing in my songs, I've
lived.
   ``I don't wish the others would have to go through that. But I
believe I've got the credentials to sing some of the things I sing
about where some others don't.
   ``The whole deal with my music has been the emotional quality.
Songs I do have to strike an emotional chord the first time I sing
them. It's not uncommon for me to get so wrapped up in a song that
I cry several times when I sing them. That's the difference between
my music and some of the other folks.''
   His ``Don't Close Your Eyes'' is about the desperation of love.
   ``People identified with it. Women seemed to like it and they
are a big part of the record-buying public. At shows, people often
come up to me and say they feel like it was written about them.
   ``The melody is real mournful. You can get lost emotionally
singing it.''
   One of the songs on the album is ``I Never Go Around Mirrors,''
a hit years ago by the late country star Lefty Frizzell.
   Whitley had a verse added to the song. A few hours before he
recorded it, he visited Frizzell's grave and wept.
   ``That sounds weird to people. But his music was very important
to me growing up,'' Whitley said. People don't understand why I did
that, but it meant a lot to me.''

<HEAD>Bone Loss In Women Runners May Be Irreversible, Studies Suggest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who exercise enough to disrupt their
menstrual periods may suffer an irreversible loss of strength in
their bones that could lead to serious fractures or a kind of
premature aging, new studies suggest.
   A 24-year-old woman whose periods are irregular can have the
bones of a 50-year-old, said Dr. Charles H. Chesnut of the
University of Washington. ``Once that loss has occurred, it appears
there's very little we can do about it.''
   The bone loss can lead to potentially serious spinal fractures
and to less serious stress fractures that will keep women from
exercising.
   Women can regain regular periods by reducing their level of
exercise, but the bones don't seem to fully recover, said Chesnut.
   ``That attitude of some of the women's running gurus has been a
bit irresponsible,'' said Dr. Robert Marcus of Stanford University
in Palo Alto, Calif. ``They basically take the cavalier view that,
yes, if you stop, everything comes back.''
   Recreational athletes, or women who are just trying to stay fit,
don't suffer disruption of periods, Chesnut said.
   The loss or disruption of menstrual periods, known technically
as amenorrhea, occurs most in runners, cyclists, swimmers and
ballet dancers, said Anne Loucks, a research endocrinologist at the
University of California, San Diego, and an authority on the effect
of exercise on women.
   Researchers don't know why intense exercise affects menstrual
periods. ``Most people think it's probably a combination of
factors,'' said Barbara Drinkwater, an exercise and environmental
physiologist at the Pacific Medical Center in Seattle who has
collaborated with Chesnut.
   ``How much of the problem is due to exercise, how much is due to
nutrition, how much is due to psychological stress _ I don't think
anyone can say with certainty,'' she said.
   Estimates of the frequency vary widely, said Loucks, with some
researchers reporting the problem in only a few percent of athletes
and others reporting some disruption of periods in as many as 40
percent of women athletes.
   Chesnut said the women he and Drinkwater studied did not begin
to have problems until they were running 30 miles to 35 miles per
week or more. (That threshhold varies from one individual to the
next, he said.)
   ``For most women who are only trying to stay in shape, keep
their weight down and are running 10 to 20 miles a week, there is
no cause for concern as long as their periods remain regular.
Exercise is of benefit for a woman at any age so long as it is kept
in perspective and does not result in a loss of periods,'' he said.
   Drinkwater underscored the point. ``We want to be very sure that
people don't get the idea that exercise causes low bone mass.
Exercise is beneficial to bone. It's the amenorrhea that's
responsible for the decrease of bone density.''
   Women whose periods remain normal can exercise all they like,
Drinkwater said. ``I don't think we want to frighten women away
from exercise. What we want to say is _ be sensible in your
approach to it.''
   Loucks also notes that many things can cause a woman to lose
regular menstrual periods. ``A woman who stops menstruating
definitely should consult with her gynecologist to rule out other
possibilities.''
   Getting women athletes to the doctor isn't always easy, however.
``They view themselves as very healthy,'' she said. ``It's very
hard to convince them they have a problem.''
   In February, one researcher seemed to reinforce that notion by
suggesting that women who begin running vigorously before puberty
may face a decreased cancer risk later in life.
   The researcher, Rose E. Frisch of the Harvard School of Public
Health in Boston, said girls who exercise in elementary school can
delay the onset of puberty and may thereby lower their breast
cancer risk.
   Loucks expressed reservations about that view, saying Frisch's
studies of young runners did not document disruptions in menstrual
periods.
   ``That is not correct,'' said Frisch. ``We documented them in
the greatest detail.''
   Marcus was more forceful in his criticism: ``It boggles the mind
that a reasonable investigator would say something like that. She
obviously did not do a study in which she followed women for 40
years, watching them develop or not develop cancer.''
   Frisch said many other studies support her findings, and she
emphasized that the studies only suggest that delaying puberty
would reduce breast cancer risk. ``I have no guarantee that it
would,'' she said.
   The mechanism of bone loss in amenorrheic women is not
completely clear, but researchers say they do have a plausible
hypothesis.
   Women who have lost their periods do not produce as much of the
female sex hormone estrogen, which leads to calcium loss. So the
researchers assume that exercise-related bone loss ``is due to the
low estrogen levels in the amenorrheic athletes,'' Loucks said.
   The same thing happens after menopause, leading to the disorder
called osteoporosis, characterized by loss of calcium and fragile
bones.
   Loucks said the underlying disorder that triggers the amenorrhea
in exercising women appears to be in the brain, perhaps in the
hypothalamus, which controls the body's hormonal system. The
hypothalamus sends signals to the pituitary gland, which in turn
regulates hormone production.
   Chesnut and Drinkwater found that women who stop exercising and
regain menstrual periods can recover some, but probably not all, of
the lost bone.
   Because bone loss is difficult or impossible to remedy, doctors
must focus on prevention, Chesnut said. ``We want to get to these
women athletes as soon as possible after amenorrhea occurs, within
five to six months certainly, and presumably get them on estrogen
replacement, so we can prevent that loss before it's occurred.
Because once that loss has occurred, it appears there's very little
we can do about it.''
   Estrogen may not be suitable for all women, however. Some
researchers have linked estrogen treatment _ which is often
prescribed for women after menopause _ with an increased risk of
cancer, especially breast cancer. Others have found no risk.
   ``It's something that needs to be studied,'' said Chesnut. ``I
would not want all physicians to start putting all of their
amenorrheic women on estrogens at the time of amenorrhea.''
   Giving calcium alone does not seem to prevent the bone loss, he
said.
   Marcus acknowledged that some serious competitive athletes may
be unwilling to reduce the intensity of their exercise, but he
noted that the bone weakness itself may ultimately force them to
stop exercising.

<HEAD>Researchers Disagree Over Reported Genetic Sex Trigger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that scientists have found the gene
that makes a man a man, some of them would like to see equal rights
for the gene that makes a woman a woman.
   Last winter, Dr. David Page of the Whitehead Institute in
Cambridge, Mass., announced the discovery of what appears to be the
male sex trigger _ a bit of genetic material that separates the
boys from the girls.
   If Page is right, there is one sex switch. Those who get this
gene at conception will be boys. Those who don't will be girls.
   Page has offered a variety of explanations. But many scientists
assume it means there is a gene for masculinity and not for
femininity.
   One researcher who disagrees with this assumption is Dr. Eva M.
Eicher, a geneticist at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor. She
said she has no quarrel with Page, only with how his discovery is
interpretted.
   ``There is sexism in biology,'' Eicher said. ``There is no
question about it. It influences the way that biologists approach
problems, such as sex determination.''
   Even the language of genetics, such as ``dominant'' and
``recessive,'' carry subconscious connotations about the roles of
men and women, she said.
   According to her theory _ and she emphasizes it's only that _
the genetic library of the human race contains two sex genes. One
contains the instructions for building boys, the other for making
girls.
   She said many experts believe a maleness gene is necessary to
make testis and all the internal and external sex organs of
manhood. But for making females, only the absence of this gene is
necessary.
   ``When it comes to sex, the active process is testis and the
passive or default process is ovary,'' she said. ``I don't think
nature works by doing nothing. There has to be an active pathway''
to womanhood.
   Dr. Elizabeth Simpson of the Clinical Research Center in Harrow,
England agrees. ``It may be simple-minded to think that you have a
switch to go down one pathway but nothing to go down the other,''
she said.
   Everybody is born with two strings of genes, known as sex
chromosomes, that are called X and Y. Women have two X chromosomes,
but men have an X and a Y.
   Page found the gene that seems to control maleness on the Y
chromosome. But he also found a closely related gene on the X
chromosome; nobody knows what that gene does.
   Eicher speculates that this is the female gene. The process
might work like this:
   If an egg is fertilized by a ``male'' sperm, the sex gene on its
Y chromosome kicks to life, starting a chain reaction of hormones
that eventually direct the fetus to become a boy. Among its jobs is
shutting off the female sex gene on the X chromosome.
   But if there is no Y sex gene, then a few hours later, the X sex
gene turns on, starting the process toward womanhood.
   This is mostly speculation, although Eicher said she has found a
hint in some strains of mice that something like this could be
going on. But at least by challenging people's assumptions, she
hopes to eventually get closer to the biological truth.
   ``We think we know so much,'' she said. ``What I am continually
amazed by is that we know almost nothing.''

   When Tim Dennehy gets frustrated about the
EPA, he starts talking about Oreo cookies and milk.
   Dennehy says that if he believed Oreos could control insects and
he wanted to dangle them in a field, the Environmental Protection
Agency would force him to do a battery of tests to learn if the
cookies were an environmental threat.
   ``At this point, I don't know if that's an exaggeration,'' says
Dennehy, who spent two years getting permits to test pheromones _
chemicals that insects produce to communicate _ as an alternative
to pesticides.
   He and pheromone expert Wendell Roelofs have devised a compound
simulating the mating scent of female Grape Berry Moths. Dennehy
says it is as safe ``as spraying milk'' on crops, can replace up to
12 pounds of insecticides, and doesn't even kill the bugs it is
meant to control.
   James Touhey, an EPA adviser, acknowledges that regulations for
toxic pesticides are unnecessarily stringent for such non-toxic
alternatives, but is confident that ways can be found to simplify
the process.
   ``Pheromones are in their infancy in terms of practical use,''
says Richard Ridgway, head of the Insect Chemical Ecology
Laboratory at the Agricultural Research Service in Beltsville, Md.
   About 250 pheromones have been identified since their discovery
in 1959, and some are being used, Ridgway says, including one to
control the cotton boll weevil and another on the Oriental fruit
moth on California peaches.
   However, they never lived up to their early promise. Companies
can't make enough profit because they only work for one species,
limiting the market. They are not successful on pests that gather
in great numbers, masking the scent. And research and development
has run into regulatory roadblocks and apathy.
   Dennehy and Roelofs spent nearly two years getting a permit for
a large-scale test. They had to learn legal jargon to explain what
they wanted to do, track down the right forms and present pages of
evidence and documentation required by the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act.
   ``Our problem is that we have a non-toxic chemical being watched
over by regulations for toxic chemicals,'' said Roelofs, who works
with Dennehy at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station of
Cornell University.
   Touhey, senior agricultural adviser to the EPA office of
pesticide programs, said, ``It seems the traditional mechanisms
that were working in the past to regulate things doesn't seem to be
working now.''
   In Dennehy's experiment, male moths attracted to clear plastic
twist-ties laced with the pheromone have trouble finding fertile
females, thus preventing explosive growth of the bugs in the
vineyard.
   He had sought a permit letting him use pheromones _ which have a
chemical makeup similar to olive oil _ and sell the grapes. EPA
said OK, but only if he destroyed the grapes, costing him $10,000
he might have earned.
   Then it said he could sell them.
   Dennehy expects to have results from his tests in 100 acres of
grapes across New York after the harvest. If they are favorable,
the next step will be to get the pheromone on the market.
   Dave Ross, who grows 275 acres of grapes in Westfield near Lake
Erie, said he would welcome a chance to stop using the pesticide
Parathion. ``Any time we can eliminate using something that
dangerous, I think it's a good thing.''
   Under current rules, however, the EPA requires a study to
determine environmental impact of the ``pesticide.'' That includes
feeding it to ducks and shellfish, and could cost millions, Dennehy
said.
   Both Touhey and Ridgway believe a compromise can be reached that
will make it easier for pheromones to reach farmers and growers.
   In some cases, tests could be waived, Touhey said. In others,
the number of tests could be cut. Meanwhile, he's trying to help
pheromone researchers get certain permits and guide them through
the regulatory maze.
   And while theoretically Oreo cookies and milk used to ``control
or mitigate'' insects would be pesticides, realistically the morass
of regulations includes a waiver of tests, he said. ``But I get the
point.''

<HEAD>Heartworm Drug Can Prevent African Parasite Infection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug long used to free dogs of heartworms also
apparently prevents a serious parasitic disease among visitors to
some parts of Africa.
   An estimated 13 million people in western and central Africa are
infected with loa loa, the African eyeworm, but loiasis, the
disease it causes, is usually most severe among outsiders who visit
Africa.
   The worm is spread by biting flies that feed on human blood, and
is parasitic in or just under the skin, often migrating to around
the eyes.
   The heartworm drug, diethylcarbamazine, kills the worm before

<HEAD>Archaeologist Seeks To Market Obsidian, Glass Surgical Blades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An archaeologist who cut himself 20 years
ago on a 3,500-year-old obsidian blade thinks the Mayans had the
right idea.
   Payson Sheets says obsidian blades can be 500 times sharper than
steel, resulting in more exact cuts that heal quicker and with less
scarring. He and ophthalmologist Firmon Hardenbergh are seeking
Food and Drug Administration permission to make and sell glass and
obsidian surgical blades.
   Obsidian, formed when lava cools too quickly to crystallize, was
traded throughout the Americas by Indians as tool material. Unlike
steel, Sheets says, the black, glassy material can be fractured to
a few molecules thick.
   Hardenbergh uses the blades in cornea transplants and cataract
surgery, and the partners have loaned obsidian and glass blades to
other surgeons while they await FDA approval, Sheets says. That
process could take more than a year.
   Sheets also is experimenting by mixing a hardening agent into
molten glass so blades will hold a tougher and more consistent
edge. He pours the molten glass into molds to make blades of
different shapes and sizes.

<HEAD>Planned Building Will Display Effects of Wind, Quakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anyone nervous about the effects of wind
or earthquakes on the University of Tennessee's planned engineering
building will have only to go down to the lobby and see what the
building says.
   Instruments planted throughout the building when it is built
beginning next summer will measure those forces and display them
and the movements of machines and people on a computer-generated
graphic display.
   ``We will put transducers in the beams and columns to measure
varying loads and how the building responds to those loads,'' said
Richard Bennett, associate professor of civil engineering.
``Instruments that measure wind pressure will be installed so we
can determine how the building is affected by wind, and how the
real responses compare to the formulas we now use to design
buildings.
   ``It will be a working laboratory. We will be able to make
precise measurements of forces that before could only be
estimated.''
   The building can be used to ``demonstrate engineering mechanics
principles, and as a research tool to learn more about design and
construction and the long-term behavior of people,'' Bennett said.

<HEAD>Radiation Detector, Similar To Smoke Alarm, Gets Mixed Reviews</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: EarlyWarning cq in 2nd graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nevada company selling a home radiation
detector like a smoke detector acknowledges it won't go off until
exposure levels reach five times the minimum standards set by the
government, and safety officials question other company claims.
   ``Over a hundred nuclear power plants are a prime source of
peril for some 30 million households situated nearby,'' said Jack
Little, president of Unique Products Inc. of Reno. In an accident,
he said, people should ``get out fast.''
   ``We're not merchants of fear. On the contrary, we want people
to understand that a nuclear mishap is not like exploding a nuclear
bomb. People can protect themselves,'' Little said.
   The EarlyWarning Radiation Detector sounds an alarm at about
five times the minimum government standard for exposure of nuclear
plant workers. Little said such standards are a matter of
scientific controversy.
   A six-page manual advises that when an alarm sounds, people
should stay calm, gather essentials, lock their homes and head away
from the radiation source without speeding. Every few miles, they
should check the detector. ``When it no longer sounds, then you
know you have reached safety.''
   If the alarm sounds at a higher setting than the minimum, ``you
need to change directions.''
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Jan Strasma said more
than a sound-and-light alarm would be needed to decide how to
handle a radiation emergency.
   ``Evacuation is not always the answer,'' Strasma said, because a
building may provide protection. ``The answer to dealing with a
nuclear accident is to follow the emergency plan and the advice of
state and local officials.''
   Little pointed out that the NRC acknowledges ``nearly 3,000
accidents occur every year at U.S. power plants.''
   Strasma said that number refers to situations that include minor
procedural infractions and called Little's wording a ``vast
overstatement.''
   Nonetheless, NRC spokesman Russ Marabito said he could foresee
no agency action to counteract any statements used in selling the
device. ``If he feels it's correct, that's between him and the
buyer,'' Marabito said.
   Little had no sales information on the device, which he said was
test-marketed in California. He said U.S. and European distribution
began after the National Hardware Show here in August.

   Economists from major U.S. corporations are
predicting the economy will slow next year.
   A panel of 60 economists from the National Association of
Business Economists indicated Monday it was bullish about growth
this year, predicting an expansion of 3.9 percent as measured by
gross national product. That's more optimistic than the
administration's forecast of 3.5 percent.
   However, the median forecast for next year is an anemic 2.3
percent, substantially less than the administration forecast of 3.1
percent.

<HEAD>New Long-Term Conditions Set For Argentinian Loans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new, long-term way of dealing with the Third
World's crippling $1.2 trillion debt may be foreshadowed by $700
million worth of new loans the World Bank is offering to Argentina.
   On the surface, Argentina seems a poor prospect for more loans.
   It already owes more than $49 billion, the biggest debt of any
Third World country after Brazil and Mexico.
   It should be paying $4.5 billion this year in interest alone,
and already is about $1 billion behind in its payments. With
interest rates rising, the bill may be $1 billion higher next year.
   The financial world is so skeptical about the prospects for
repayment that Argentine loans can be bought for less than 22 cents
on the dollar.
   Finance Minister Juan Sourrouille says he hopes to pay half the
interest out of the country's own earnings. The rest he will have
to borrow, presumably from many of the same banks that lent the
original money.
   President Raul Alfonsin's government, the first one freely
elected after years of military rule, faces an election in 1989.
Many of his opponents, who are given an excellent chance to succeed
him, are talking about suspending interest payments altogether.
   Yet the 151 governments in the World Bank probably will approve
the new loans next month. The bank's sister organization, the
International Monetary Fund, has been negotiating all summer with
the Argentine government to make another $1.2 billion in loans.
Sourrouille says negotiations should be completed in a couple of
weeks, and he then will know how much to ask from the commercial
banks _ probably more than $1 billion.
   Why all this new lending? It has a lot to do with an old
banker's saying:
   ``Lend a man a thousand dollars and he's in your power; lend him
a million and you're in his.''
   The lenders keep on lending in the hope that Argentina and the
other big debtors will use the money wisely, investing in new
factories and farm equipment so they can earn more money from their
exports and catch up with their bills. It's called ``growing out of
financial difficulties.''
   The lenders, all represented at the current fund and bank
meetings in Berlin, see no other choice. The fund says the strategy
is working well, and that the debtors' exports are growing faster
than their debts.
   New loans are given under conditions usually tied to economic
policies. If the borrower fails to meet them, the disbursements are
cut off.
   Traditionally, the IMF has taken the lead in setting the
conditions, providing a ``seal of approval'' for other creditors.
But the fund was set up originally to deal with short-term currency
problems. The World Bank is intended to aid long-term development
of poor countries.
   Argentina is considered a ``middle-income'' country, with
individual earnings averaging $2,370 a year _ compared with $120 in
Ethiopia and $21,250 in Switzerland.
   But Argentina has fallen on hard times and incomes have been
declining through the 1980s. So the country is considered a
candidate for basic improvements.
   Now, for the first time, the World Bank has taken the lead in
setting conditions, and many of them are conditions on long-term
policy of a kind that the IMF would not require.
   Sourrouille not only has promised to cut government spending
sharply, but also is undertaking other changes basic to his
country's economy.
   He has promised the World Bank he will strengthen the tax
administration, reducing tax evasion and improving collections. He
is attempting to improve the bank system, making the major public
banks self-sustaining rather than dependent on government
subsidies, and has promised new policies on trade and industry.
   There has been some grumbling. Nigel Lawson, the British
chancellor of the exchequer, has warned against easing the
conditions for loans.
   The World Bank accord with Argentina reportedly made some IMF
people furious. But Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director,
welcomed the agreement publicly.
   Argentina and the fund are expected to agree on further
conditions. Commercial banks presumably will come in with their
loans, including new money for investment in Argentina. The hope is
that the new policies will put the country back on the road to the
kind of prosperity it enjoyed before World War II.
   If they do, the new leadership by the World Bank may furnish a
model for other countries in long-term trouble.

<HEAD>Business Economists Predicting Slowdown In 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Economists of major U.S. companies are predicting the economy
will slow in 1989.
   A panel of 60 economists from the National Association of
Business Economists on Monday made a median forecast of 2.3 percent
growth next year, substantially less than the Reagan
administration's forecast of 3.1 percent.
   Nearly half of the economists _ 47 percent _ said in a survey in
late August and early September that they expected the country to
topple into a recession by the end of next year.
   Another 42 percent believe a recession will occur in 1990. Only
11 percent believe the 6-year-old economic expansion will continue
into 1991 or later.
   Separately, a trade group reported that sales of existing
single-family homes increased a modest 1.1 percent in August as
buyers tried to close purchases before interest rates rose further.
   Also Monday, Senate Democrats gave up on trying to raise the
minimum wage, and their staff issued a report charging the economy
was producing mainly low-wage jobs.
   The home sales report by the National Association of Realtors
said sales of existing homes rose after a sharp 5.0 percent decline
in July.
   John Savacool, an economist with Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
economic forecasting firm, said buyers completing sales in August
probably began looking for homes in May and June.
   ``That was just after rates started rising,'' he said. The
increase ``was a mild panic response to rising rates.''
   In Washington, Senate Democrats said a five-day Republican
filibuster effectively had killed chances of raising the
$3.35-an-hour minimum wage this year.
   ``There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,''
said Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. ``I'm now
conceding that the Republican filibuster was successful.''
   The Democratic staff of the Senate Budget Committee said in its
wage report that the proportions of both high-paying and low-paying
jobs have grown in the 1980s.
   The report added fuel to an election-year debate over the
quality of the 16 million new jobs added since President Reagan
took office in 1981.
   The report said slightly more than 50 percent of the net
increase in new jobs since 1979 paid a year-round, full-time
equivalent less than $11,611, while 12 percent of them paid more
than $46,444.
   Many of the low-wage jobs were held by people who were not the
primary wage earners in their families.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the committee's ranking
Republican and former chairman, called the report ``opportunistic
and political.''

<HEAD>NYSE Seeking SEC Approval of Reforms By Black Monday Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange hopes its post-crash
reform package announced earlier this year will receive government
approval by the anniversary of the Oct. 19 market rout, but federal
regulators aren't making promises.
   Donald Solodar, senior vice president of the largest U.S. stock
market, said Monday the Securities and Exchange Commission actively
was reviewing the reform proposals, devised jointly with the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The reforms would supercede the NYSE's temporary ``collar''
restraint on computerized program trading, a six-month experiment
approved by the SEC last April 20 that was aimed at calming wild
price swings. The collar expires Oct. 19, the anniversary of the
crash.
   Speaking to reporters at an NYSE briefing about steps taken to
improve the climate for stock trading since the crash, Solodar said
it was possible the new reforms would not be in place by the
anniversary, but ``we believe the SEC will approve them.''
   In Washington, SEC officials declined to specify when the
reforms would be approved. They were announced in July, but not
filed with the regulatory agency until late August.
   ``The staff is actively reviewing these matters and is trying to
expedite its review consistent with the NYSE request,'' said
Brendon Becker, SEC associate director of market regulation.
   Market regulatory officials have said privately that potential
complications have arisen because other U.S. securities markets
dislike the proposed reforms. For example, the National Association
of Securities Dealers, which supervises over-the-counter trading,
has expressed opposition to them.
   Under the reforms, the New York and Chicago markets agreed on a
one-year pilot program for what they called coordinated ``circuit
breakers'' that would halt trading temporarily if price moves
exceeded preset limits.
   The halts would be triggered in New York by a 250-point move in
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks and in Chicago by a
12-point move in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures
contract.
   The reforms also call for tighter communication between the
Chicago and New York exchanges and a common policy on ``intermarket
front-running,'' an abuse in which traders are able to take a
profitable position in one market based on what they know will
happen in another market.
   The NYSE also has prepared what it calls an ``Individual
Investor Express Delivery Service,'' which will provide
transmission priority to individual investor orders when the Dow
average moves 25 points from its previous close.
   This reform was designed to reassure investors that their orders
will receive equal treatment with those from large institutional
investors. On Black Monday, many individuals complained they could
not sell their stock because larger investors were served first.
   NYSE officials conceded at the Monday briefing that individual
investors remain unwilling to re-enter the stock market, which has
failed to recoup much of the loss from the crash and has been
plagued by low trading volume.
   Asked to speculate when individuals would regain the confidence
to invest in stocks, NYSE President Richard Grasso said: ``That is
beyond my crystal ball at the moment.''
   A bleak assessment of when individual investor confidence also
was offered Monday in a post-crash review by Edward I. O'Brien,
president of the Securities Industry Assocation, a leading Wall
Street trade group.
   O'Brien said in a statement that although the worst fears about
the economy never materialized after the collapse and market
conditions have improved in some areas, ``the overall current
environment is at best gray.''
   He said the SIA ``believes the near-term outlook isn't likely to
improve substantially until full investor confidence is restored in
both the integrity of the marketplace and the strength of the
economy.''
   O'Brien also said there have been a few steps to correct
problems exposed as a result of the crash, ``but major regulatory
reform hasn't taken place.''

<HEAD>OPEC Chairman Says Oil Cartel On Cusp Of Starting Over</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto is cq as one name.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC's president says the cartel's attempts
to restore production discipline among its members are unlikely to
produce any startling breakthroughs, but could mark the start of
the group's climb back to its former authority in the world oil
market.
   In an interview with the Associated Press, OPEC President
Rilwanu Lukman also said the cartel's decision to review crude oil
price and production objectives was part of a methodical process
aimed at achieving unity among its members and shoring up prices.
   ``Now the time has come to sit down and say, okay, this is what
we want; this is how we're going to do it _ let's go ahead an do
it,'' Lukman said in an interview at the end of a two-day
extraordinary meeting here of OPEC's five-member Price Monitoring
Committee.
   The pricing committee announced Monday it had called for a joint
meeting with the five-member Long Term Strategy Committee.
   Lukman said the move would bring together key members of
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to ``see if we can
come up with something we can sell to the organization as a whole.''
   The pricing committee issued a communique that said: ``it is
essential that OPEC review its objectives and strategies in the
context of current circumstances for the short, medium and the long
terms especially concerning the price of oil and the production
mechanism to support it in the light of the expressed positions of
member countries.''
   OPEC has attempted to maintain a world crude oil price of $18 a
barrel by restricting the output of its members.
   But internal dissension that worsened during the eight-year war
between Iran and Iraq _ two founding members of OPEC _ has led to
overproduction and a world oil glut that has depressed crude prices
to their lowest levels in two years.
   The Paris-based International Energy Energy Agency reported OPEC
production at 19 million barrels a day in August and Lukman has put
OPEC production at closer to 20 million barrels per day.
   Last June, OPEC set a 15.06 million barrel a day ceiling to
apply to all OPEC nations except Iraq, which contended it needed
the to produce more oil to help rebuild its war-torn economy.
   On Monday, North Sea Brent crude for delivery in October was
quoted at $13.25, up slightly from Friday.
   The signing of an Iran-Iraq ceasefire in August apparently
opened a door of opportunity for the start of a slow, but deep
review of OPEC's strategies and targets regarding pricing and
production policies.
   Iran and Iraq are members of the Long Term Strategy Committee.
Others include Saudia Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela. The pricing
committee comprises the oil ministers of Nigeria, Saudi Arabia,
Algeria, Indonesia and Venezuela.
   Referring to Iran and Iraq at a press conference Monday in
Madrid, OPEC Secretary General Subroto of Indonesia said both
countries indicated they would participate in the joint committee
meeting set for next month at an undisclosed location. Subroto said
it would be the first time in years that Iran and Iraq engaged in
direct talks within OPEC.
   OPEC officials said the decision to call a joint meeting of the
pricing and long term strategy committees before any extraordinary
session of all OPEC ministers was part of a negotiating process
that was arranged at the previous price monitoring committee
meeting Aug. 3 in Lausanne, Switzerland.
   After that meeting, Subroto was asked to visit various OPEC
countries to discuss possibilities and ideas that could smooth over
differences within the cartel, the officials said.
   ``All these meetings are part of a decision-making process,''
Lukman said.
   But he emphasized the slow, steady pace toward more unity could
not be expected to bring about startling breakthroughs. Lukman said
no OPEC officials believe the first joint committee meeting will
produce a new benchmark price or quotas.
   ``I'm not trying to belittle the importance of the (joint)
meeting. We could come up with something which is big,'' Lukman
said.
   ``All the major actors will be there,'' he said. ``At the end of
the day we'll get something.''
   Speaking of Iraq, Lukman said ``Nobody should be allowed to act

   Kroger Co. expects to raise $333 million after
taxes from the sale of stores and food processing plants under a
massive restructuring aimed at thwarting two takeover bids.
   The $4.6 billion restructuring will leave Kroger shareholders
with continuing interest in the company and will be more lucrative
than the unsolicited purchase offers by Dart Group Corp. the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Kroger officials
said Monday in outlining the plan.
   Kroger Chairman Lyle Everingham and president Joseph Pichler
said the restructuring also would turn Kroger, the nation's largest
supermarket operator, into a smaller, albeit highly leveraged
company.
   Kroger's board of directors rejected as inadequate both the $4.6
billion cash and securities offer by New York-based Kohlberg Kravis
and the rival $4.32 billion bid by Dart, of Landover, Md.
   The board also was advised there could be antitrust problems
with the offer from Kohlberg Kravis, which recently outbid Dart for
the Safeway and Stop & Shop grocery chains.
   Kroger stock rose 62{ cents to close at $56.37{ a share in New
York Stock Exchange trading Monday.
   The restructuring, which will be Kroger's second since 1986, is
worth $57 to $61 per share, officials said.
   Kroger's plan, which was publicly proposed Sept. 13, would pay
company shareholders $40 a share in cash, plus securities valued at
$8 and publicly traded stock worth between $5 and $10.
   The company will net about $333 million from the sale of assets,
and will lay off workers at its Cincinnati headquarters.
   Everingham declined to tell reporters which food processing
plants will be sold or how many headquarters employees would be
laid off. Those layoffs will be in addition to a cost-cutting
program already under way to reduce headquarters employment through
attrition, Everingham said.
   Kroger said it had commitments for $3.6 billion in bank
financing for the restructuring, from a group led by New York's
Citibank and Chemical Bank and First National Bank of Chicago.
   Spokesmen for Dart and Kohlberg Kravis declined comment Monday.
   Kroger said it would sell some of its food processing facilities
nationwide; its 27-supermarket Fry's of California division in
northern California; its six-unit Welcome Inc. superwarehouse
venture in Greenville, S.C., Jacksonville, Fla., Mobile, Ala., and
Richmond, Va.; and its 29 supermarkets in Charlotte, N.C., and
Charleston, S.C.
   Kroger also said it would sell its 16-unit Price Savers
Wholesale Warehouse Inc. to a management-led investment group,
would continue the sale of its Florida Choice division, and would
and then lease back Kroger-owned stores and real estate in Texas.
It will continue its Texas retail operations in that state and will
sell its general merchandise distribution center in San Marcos,
Texas.
   The 105-year-old company announced Friday that it intended to go
ahead with the restructuring despite competing offers by Dart and
Kohlberg Kravis. The Haft family, which controls Dart, triggered
the competition when federal regulators announced this month that
they had given the Hafts clearance to buy at least $15 million
worth of Kroger stock.
   Dart, a retailing company which has been involved in a number of
unsuccessful but profitable takeover bids in recent years, offered
a week ago to buy Kroger for $55 a share in cash and securities for
each of Kroger's 78.6 million outstanding shares.
   Kohlberg Kravis entered the bidding Tuesday with an offer to buy
Kroger for $58.50 in cash and securities in a leveraged buyout.
   Kroger operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience
stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also
processes food products for sale in its stores and to outside
customers.
   Kohlberg Kravis won a hostile takeover battle for Beatrice Cos.
in which the Haft family was a bidder in 1985, and outbid the Hafts
for Safeway in 1986 and Stop & Shop earlier this year.
   Dart owns the Crown Books and Trak Auto Stores chains.

<HEAD>Industry Survey Finds 40 Percent Pay Bank Credit Cards In Full
Each Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Bankers Association says
changing tax laws are prompting more consumers to pay their credit
card balances in full each month.
   A new survey by the industry trade group indicates 40 percent of
consumers pay their monthly card bills in full, up from about 33
percent last year.
   David Hunt, vice chairman of ABA's Retail Electronic Services
and Bank Card Division, said the increase stemmed from the federal
tax law, which is phasing out credit card interest deductions over
a four-year period ending in 1991.
   The study, released Monday, also found that overall growth in
the bank credit card business had slowed because of stiff
competition from other issuers, such as Sears and American Express.
   ``The survey results reflect the fierce competition among bank
card issuers,'' said Hunt. ``The range of prices and card features
gives consumers a virtually unlimited number of options.''
   The number of Visa and MasterCard cardholders grew by about 9
percent last year, a slowdown in the rate of previous years,
according to Hunt. Visa and MasterCard, both bank-owned credit card
associations, represent 60 percent of the bank credit card market.
   ``We've seen the entrance of significant new competition over
the last couple of years,'' said Hunt, who also is executive vice
president of Signet Banking Corp., Richmond, Va.
   The report found consumers charged more than $165 billion on
their bank cards last year, an increase of 18.8 percent for
Mastercard and 12.3 percent for Visa.
   The ABA report was based on a survey of 1,444 card-issuing banks
selected from a national sample based on asset size and includes
1987 and first quarter 1988 data on bank card interest rates, fees,
marketing and operations.
   The number of banks charging the maximum interest rate allowed
in their states declined to less than one-fourth, according to
Hunt, who attributed the drop to increased market competition.
   Banks that charged the maximum rate included 18 percent of banks
with assets under $300 million and 27 percent of large banks with
assets above $1 billion, the report said.
   In comparison, last year's report found that 35 percent of the
large banks, with assets above $1 billion, charged the maximum
rate. That report also showed that about 26 percent of banks with
assets below $500 million charged the highest rate allowed in their
states.
   The ABA is the national trade and professional association for
U.S. full service banks of all sizes. The bank card conference runs
through Wednesday.

<HEAD>Big Three Competitors Say GMAC Leasing Incentives No Big Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN L. ADLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Acceptance Corp. is planning waves
of publicity for its new car and truck leasing incentives but its
Big Three competitors say the offerings are nothing new.
   GMAC, the finance arm of the world's largest manufacturer, said
Monday its ``SmartLease'' program can save customers money on
monthly payments and tell them in advance how much it will cost to
buy the car at the end of the lease.
   The most popular cars GM makes are included in the program, but
GMAC offered neither a range of savings nor specific examples of
savings on any models.
   The finance divisions of Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
they have offered similar deals for most of the decade.
   ``We have had a consumer leasing program that has been promoted
extensively,'' Ford Motor Credit Co. spokeswoman Joy Wolfe said.
``We feel that we have been a leader in consumer leasing.''
   Clifford Damaska, Ford retail lease manager, said the company
has offered a variety of incentives over the last 18 months while
competing with the special interest rates and cash rebates offered
to retail buyers.
   Chrysler Financial Corp. spokesman Robert Heath said the No. 3
carmaker's Gold Key Lease Finance Plan offers the same features as
GMAC's.
   Heath said Chrysler dealers work out the final post-lease
purchase price with the customer.
   Included in the GMAC promotion, which runs through Dec. 31, are
the Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta, the Pontiac Grand Am, three
Cutlass models and two GMC truck lines, company spokesman John
Andrews said.
   ``What we've done is a corporate-wide program,'' Andrews said.
``Leasing programs have been done by each of the divisions. Under
our old programs, the purchase price was determined at the end of
lease and was the fair market value of the car.''
   Knowing the post-lease or residual value of the car up front is
an advantage to the buyer in considering whether to buy out the
lease at its end, Andrews said.
   The end of auto interest deductions on federal tax returns has
made leasing a more attractive option, especially for young
families trying to meet mortgage payments, which still are partly
tax deductible, he said.
   ``It's also a lifestyle thing,'' Andrews said. ``It isn't
important for people to own things like it used to be.''
   National promotion of the SmartLease program began during Sunday
night's telecast of the Summer Olympics. Extensive electronic and
print ads are planned.

<HEAD>Report: Arizona, New Hampshire, Maryland Best At Stimulating
Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High technology and the Reagan administration's
defense buildup are responsible for the economic vitality of states
that top a new survey of job and business creation, economists say.
   Inc. magazine's annual report on the states gave Arizona, New
Hampshire and Maryland the best track record for creating new jobs
and businesses and stimulating growth of young companies in the
last four years.
   ``A lot of these states are where they are because of what has
happened in the last four to six years in the federal defense
buildup,'' said Stanley Duobinis, director of regional economic
forecasting for the Wefa Group in suburban Philadelphia.
   Many new electronics firms concentrated in Phoenix have defense
contracts. No. 5 Virginia boasts the Pentagon and naval shipyards
in Newport News. Maryland, where Bethlehem Steel once was the
largest employer, now hosts companies such as Westinghouse and
Bendix Defense Systems.
   ``You'll find a lot of those electronics firms are indeed in
that San Diego out to Phoenix area,'' Duobinis said. ``A lot of
that has been defense stimulated.''
   The Inc. survey concludes the South and Southwest are thriving,
but notes that some industrial states are making a comeback partly
due to programs that use small amounts of tax dollars to foster
private growth.
   Independent business analysts said the desert belt of Arizona
and California and the rest of the South continue to benefit from
lower wages, warm climate and defense growth.
   ``The states in the South and some in the Southwest have in fact
lower wages and do attract business and continue to expand based on
their lower cost of doing business,'' said Lew Hurt, regional group
associate director for Data Resources, the Lexington-based economic
forecasting firm.
   The Inc. survey measures how a state has done in stimulating
entrepreneurial activity and economic expansion. It reflects the
state economies' successes over a four-year period in job
generation, new-business creation and young-company growth.
   For example, Arizona earned its third consecutive top ranking
with 23.1 percent job growth since 1984 and 1,769 new companies
with at least 10 employees for a 2.87 percent business birthrate,
while 4 percent of companies founded since 1980 were rated
fast-growing.
   Wyoming, last for the second straight year, lost 10.9 percent of
its jobs, had a 0.8 percent business birthrate and a 0.97 percent
rate of growing businesses.
   Some notable changes include Texas, which slipped from 12th to
20th with a job growth of just 2.9 percent due to the slumping oil
industry.
   Economists said the decline in the value of the dollar and
improving foreign trade figures have been major reasons for
economic optimism in the slumping industrial Midwest.
   In the Inc. survey, Michigan, Indiana and Ohio _ Nos. 23, 24, 25
_ each showed job growth of over 10.7 percent since 1984, and
economists said most of it has come in the last two years.
Pennsylvania rose to 28th from 32nd with a strong 3.2 percent small
company growth rate.
   ``They've been down so long that there's only one way to really
to go and that's up,'' Hurt said.
   Michigan was cited for using small amounts of public money to
create incentives for larger private investment. Inc. said Ohio now
offers matching grants to promising new companies, while Indiana
offers tax credits to citizens who invest in a venture capital fund
to support businesses.
   High-tech industry spinoffs from California and Massachusetts
contributed to high rankings for Arizona, New Hampshire and even
Maine, which jumped to 15th from 26th. Analysts said paper mills
there have shifted production to computer paper from plain, old
yellow pads.
   Inc., based in Boston, used data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics and Cognetics Inc., a Cambridge-based researcher, for
the survey, which appears in the magazine's October issue.

<TEXT>
   A dissident shareholder group trying to
sell Zenith Electronics Corp. says it was pleased the board of
directors will allow a vote on the plan but that it still lacks
important company data.
   Zenith's board of directors amended the company's bylaws Monday
so that New York-based Brookhurst Partners' plan to sell the
company would require approval by a simple majority of shareholders.
   Before the action, company bylaws would have required unanimous
consent from shareholders, a provision contested in court by
Brookhurst.
   Brookhurst spokesman Tom Franco said the revison was a positive
step but his group needed to see Zenith's financial records and a
list of company stockholders.
   ``It's hard for us to make any qualitative statement on the
action by the board of directors today,'' Franco said in a
telephone interview Monday. ``We look forward to bringing our case
to the shareowners, but we are still waiting for the owners' list.''
   Zenith stock fell 25 cents a share to $19.75 Monday in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said in a statement that his
company revised the bylaw ``so shareholders will not be distracted
from the key issue of who is best qualified to direct the future of
this company _ Zenith's present board or Brookhurst Partners.''
   Zenith spokesman John Taylor refused to elaborate on Pearlman's
statement, citing Securities and Exchange Commission regulations,
or to say whether Zenith had made any recommendation to
shareholders on the Brookhurst offer.
   Zenith, the last remaining U.S. television manufacturer, has
lost millions in recent years struggling to compete with low-cost
imported electronic goods.
   Last year, the company posted a loss of $19.1 million on sales
of $2.36 billion.
   Brookhurst, which owns 6.1 percent of Zenith's outstanding
common shares, bought into the company in June with the intention
of selling the television and computer maker, Franco said.
   But Franco said his group, formed by Herbert Abelow and Nicholas
Ihasz, would be open to a ``realistic management plan to achieve
profitability.''

<HEAD>Britian's Trade Gap Fells In August</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit totaled 1.813
billion pounds, or $3.06 billion, in August _ the second-worst
monthly shortfall _ but it narrowed sharply from the previous
month's record gap, the government reported Tuesday.
   The deficit report was below market forecasts of up to 1.9
billion pounds, or $3.17 billion, and the British pound firmed on
the news. Stock prices also got a slight boost.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said in a statement
that the Conservative government had tightened monetary conditions
to curb sharp rises in imports and ``the effects of this will
inevitably take some time to come through.''
   British commercial banks have pushed up their base interest
rates by 4.5 percent to 12 percent since early June.
   The seasonally adjusted merchandise trade deficit had spurted 72
percent to a record 2.65 billion pounds, or $4.5 billion, in July,
prompting a full percentage point increase in interest rates.
   Exports in August totaled 6.75 billion pounds, or $11.4 billion,
down from 6.775 billion pounds, or $11.45 billion, in July and up
from 6.6 billion pounds, or $11.1 billion, in August 1987.
   Imports totalled 8.561 billion pounds, or $14.5 billion, down 9
percent from 9.427 billion pounds, or $15.9 billion, in July and up
from 8 billion pounds, or $13.5 billion, in August 1987.
   For the first eight months of the year, the merchandise trade
balance has been in deficit by 12.85 billion pounds, or $21.7
billion, more than double the 6.160 billion pound, or $10.4
billion, gap a year ago.

   Finance Minister Shirley Kuo said Tuesday
the reimposition of a capital-gains tax on stock profits next year
is meant to maintain a fair taxation system despite investors'
worries the levy would trigger a market slump.
   ``It is not government intervention. We merely want to make it
fair to all taxpayers,'' Kuo told a news conference.
   On Saturday, Kuo announced the government would reimpose the tax
on stock profits next year after a 12-year freeze.
   Individual investors who sell stocks worth more than 3 million
Taiwan dollars, or $103,448, should include the stock income when
filing their annual income tax, she said.
   Observers said the surprise move, timed before the four-day,
Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, was designed to cool down the stock
market.
   ``There will surely be heavy selling pressure when it re-opens
Thursday,'' said Philip Young, vice president of International
Investment Trust Company Ltd.

<HEAD>New Pact For Innovative Margin Rules Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the nation's
largest options clearing house have reached an agreement on new
rules to ease the strain on the system caused by heavy trading,
officials said.
   The agreement between the Merc and Chicago-based Options
Clearing Corp., announced Monday calls for cross-margining on
certain stock index futures and options accounts.
   Margins are deposits paid by traders to cover the risk of daily
losses. Cross margining allows traders to have credit for trading
positions that reduce their risk of loss.
   Under the plan, traders who have protected their positions by
hedging in both markets would have to put up less money for their
margins.
   The practice was recommended by a presidential commission that
investigated last October's stock market crash and must be approved
by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities
Futures Trading Commission.
   Officials from the Mercantile Exchange and Options Clearing, the
nation's largest options clearing house, have been working on the
cross-margining program for about a year.
   Had cross-margining been permitted during the huge decline in
the stock market on Oct. 19, it would have reduced the strain on
the nation's financial system and eased demands for cash on several
major banks that ran into billions of dollars a day.

<HEAD>Democrats Push Job-Protected Leaves For Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fresh from losing a bruising fight to raise
the minimum wage, Senate Democrats marched back onto the
battlefield with an equally controversial proposal requiring
job-protected medical and parental leaves for workers.
   ``What a profound and strong signal it would be'' to approve
such a requirement, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said Monday in
opening debate on the measure. ``It would be catching up with the
needs of people in this country.''
   Dodd's bill would guarantee at least 13 weeks of unpaid,
job-protected leave to seriously ill workers and at least 10 weeks
to those with newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children.
Businesses of under 20 employees would be exempt.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., planned to offer a substitute
reducing the medical leave length to 10 weeks but it was unclear
whether such a change would attract the 60 votes necessary to cut
off debate.
   Conservatives and many in the business community contend the
government should not mandate benefits.
   ``I am concerned that this legislation may impede the trend ...
now developing in the workplace where employees are able to choose
from a variety of benefits,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   He and others also say any leave requirement would be an
economic hardship on small businesses. But Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, said
Congress' watchdog agency, the General Accounting Office, has
estimated the bill would cost employers $3.50 per worker per year.
   ``A penny a day so that working parents won't lose their jobs
when they care for a newborn ... when they must care for a
seriously ill child,'' Kennedy said. ``I put the choice to the
opponents of this bill _ can you spare a penny a day for these
children? Or is this economic expansion so fragile that a penny a
day will do us in?''
   Kennedy said he had received three veto letters from the Reagan
administration on the family leave bill.
   Dodd appealed Monday for bipartisan support from his colleagues
and from Vice President George Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential nominee, already has endorsed the Dodd approach.
   Bush has said women shouldn't have to worry about getting their
jobs back after a maternity leave but has not issued a detailed
proposal. He is said to favor a voluntary approach involving tax
breaks for businesses that offer job-protected leaves. Sen. Dan
Quayle, R-Ind., the GOP vice presidential nominee, opposed the Dodd
bill in committee.
   Senate work on the parental leave bill came as the chamber's
Democratic leaders on Monday gave up all hope of passing
legislation to increase the minimum wage this year, conceding
defeat to a Republican filibuster.

   Oil futures prices plunged to near two-year lows
for the second time this month as fears of a worsening oil glut
spread through the market.
   Analysts said rumors that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer,
was continuing its discount strategy to boost market share in the
wake of the cartel's price meeting sent the market into a tailspin.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, was trading
as much as 35 cents lower, between $13.85 and $14.02 a barrel,
compared with Monday's closing price of $14.20.
   Today's rumors were that the Saudis were offering discounts to
the Japanese, said Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   But other OPEC nations, including the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait and Iraq also are reported to be producing far in excess of
their assigned quotas.
   ``It seems as if there's been a complete breakdown, with the
Arabs leading the charge toward market share,'' Beutel said.
   The fall in crude prices pulled down oil product prices.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery was trading
between 44.50 and 44.90 cents a gallon, down from its close of
45.25 cents a gallon on Monday.
   And October wholesale heating oil had lost 1.13 cents before
midday, to 39.10 cents a gallon from Monday's settlement price of
40.23 a gallon.
   The long-anticipated meeting of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries' price committee adjourned Monday after two
days of talks with no concrete steps announced for dealing with the
world oversupply of oil or weakening oil prices.
   On Monday, confusion and uncertainty over OPEC's intentions
caused wild gyrations in prices and trading activity, analysts said.
   ``Rumors went both ways but there were points where buying
completely dried up, then came back,'' Beutel said.
   Energy futures prices opened higher, then tumbled after
statements by OPEC Secretary General Subroto that the pricing
committee had adjourned without calling for a full meeting of the
cartel to deal with the problems of excess oil production and
sagging prices.
   Instead, Subroto said the pricing committee and OPEC's long-term
strategy committee would meet jointly next month to review supply
and demand problems.
   Analysts said the marketplace interpreted the statements as an
indication the cartel was unwilling to cut production.
   ``The marketplace was disappointed in the committee's failure to
come up with a concrete direction,'' said John Azarow, Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
mostly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade, then turned mixed
as follow-through selling from Monday abated.
   ``Everyone's just kind of feeling their way a little bit here
this morning after yesterday's bang,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst
in Chicago with the G.H. Miller division of the British-owned
trading company LIT America Inc.
   Soybean futures registered their lowest daily settlement price
in nearly four months Monday, $8.06\ a bushel for November delivery.
   Buying prompted by technical market factors provided some
support for corn and soybean futures this morning, but wheat
remained weak due to slack export demand, Gidel said.
   Analysts blamed Monday's slide on the advancing harvest, which
is increasing the amount of available corn and soybeans.
   The Agriculture Department reported Monday that corn harvesting
was 20 percent complete and soybean harvesting was 14 percent
finished as of Sunday.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to } cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.21} a bushel; corn was {
cent to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.82 a bushel; oats were
1 cent lower to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.46 a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents lower to 3 cents higher with November at

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the

cent lower to .10 cent higher with October at 40.30 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .60 cent lower to .25 cent higher with

   Bond prices were mixed in subdued trading early
today with little new economic data to move the market.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year issue was up 3-32 point,
or about 90 cents for every $1,000 in face value.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an
indicator of interest rate trends, slipped to 9.07 percent from
9.08 percent late Monday.
   Analysts said the market had not responded to an early drop in
oil prices, which usually is favorable to bonds because it signals
an easing of inflationary pressures.
   The dollar also appeared stable after waffling on Monday and
closing higher against most major currencies.
   ``It seems the (bond) market doesn't want to do anything until
we get more information,'' said Elizabeth Reiners, vice president
of money-market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Analysts said bond investors are already looking to next week's
U.S. unemployment report for a clearer indication of the economy's
direction. Unemployment rose slightly last month, which many
interpreted as a sign the economy is slowing.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues were down 1-32 point, intermediate maturities
were 1-32 point higher to 1-32 point lower, and 20-year issues were
1-16 point lower, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was down 0.16 at 1,140.47.
   Meanwhile, Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which
measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of
five years or longer, advanced 0.18 to 289.96.
   Three-month Treasury bills were up 6 basis points to a discount
rate of 7.28 percent and a yield of 7.51. Six-month bills advanced
4 basis points to 7.90 percent and a yield of 7.51 percent, while
one-year bills were unchanged at a discount rate of 7.61 and a
yield of 8.18 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8\ percent, down from 8 5-16 percent late
Monday.

   Hyster Co. contends that its Japanese
competitors now are ``dumping'' forklift parts in the United States
in an effort to evade new U.S. customs duties imposed on them for
selling complete forklifts below cost.
   After a yearlong battle by Hyster, the U.S. government decided
last spring to impose customs duties ranging as high as 50 percent
on the imports.
   The company now alleges that the Japanese are trying to
circumvent those duties by importing the vehicles in pieces and
assembling them in the United States.
   Hyster officials say they have collected data that show imports
of forklift parts have nearly doubled this year compared to last
year.
   In a letter to Department of Commerce and U.S. Customs Service
administrators, Hyster notes U.S. statistics list truck part
imports at $16.7 million in the first six months of 1987. This year
those imports jumped to $34.9 million.
   The company asks the government to determine whether trucks
assembled in the United States also should be subject to the duties.
   Hyster notes in its letter that the new trade law allows federal
officials to assess duties against companies that simply switch
from dumping finished products to dumping parts, which then are
assembled in the United States or in a third country.
   In a similar case involving dumping televisions in the United
States by South Koreans, the government decided imported parts that
were assembled in the United States also were subject to dumping
duties.

   One of the most thankless and unrewarding
positions to be in today is that of the financial adviser waiting
for the recession.
   It's been a very long wait for some of them, and a very costly
experience for their customers. One of the breed, for example,
advised his clients to get out of the stock market back in 1982,
just before the bull charged.
   While his clients thus lost out on some fantastic gains, the
investment adviser celebrated on Oct. 19, 1987, the day of the big
stock market crash, believing his views were vindicated and his
long wait made worthwhile.
   Re-invigorated, his company then made the scenario even more
bleak and black, warning that interest rates would soar, major
banks would collapse, production would cease, and a pall would
descend over economic America.
   But it didn't happen. Instead of falling into line with his
dictates and the pronouncements of his brethren, the U.S. economy
has grown sturdier since last year, and even dedicated doomsayers
now are losing their patience.
   What had sustained many of them through their long, barren wait
was the near certainty that economic expansions have limited lives
_ that the very existence of an expansion was reason enough to
forecast a recession.
   Each month, therefore, their conviction grew stronger but,
unfortunately, so did the stability of the economy. And now, in
spite of it nearing age 71 months, the economy is producing great
doubts about the recession scenario.
   Sam Nagakama, a widely followed business economist, is among
those who have recently expressed the notion that perhaps the
country already has worked its way through a problem period and may
be ready for renewed expansion.
   Broadly speaking, this is a thesis put forward by economists
such as Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and
Albert Sindlinger of Sindlinger & Co., among others, but Nakagama
gives it his own particular touch.
   As he views events, the oil price decline and the dollar's
depreciation helped the economy avoid recession in mid-1986 while
at the same time setting in motion a new cyclical expansion.
   He states that ``the oil price decline helped support consumer
demand, while dollar depreciation fueled an export-cum-capital
spending boom.'' Thus, he suggests, no early recession is likely
even if the cycle is nearly 71 months old.
   Sindlinger went on record back in late 1986 with an argument
that at least 31 states were in recession, no matter what the
national statistics showed. From that point on, he states, the
economy has become much stronger.
   Yardeni, who has challenged the conventional thinking at every
opportunity in the past year, provides an insight into how the
economy can continue to grow while, in the view of many, it is at
the limit of its capacity.
   First, he describes two scenarios that are held dear by the
``end of cycle crowd.''
   1. If the economy continues to grow, odds are that unemployment
will fall below 5 percent. Labor shortages will boost wage
inflation. Higher inflation will push interest rates to levels that
ultimately trigger recession.
   2. If the economy continues to grow, capacity utilization rates
will rise and so will prices. Again, higher inflation will push
interest rates to levels that ultimately trigger recession.
   But, he asks, what if business responds to the labor shortage
and capacity restraints by increasing labor-saving,
productivity-enhancing capital outlays?
   ``Then, capacity will expand and output can grow faster than
employment. Wages will rise in this growth-is-good, extended-cycle
scenario,'' he explains.
   However, he continues, ``the wage increases will be in line with
productivity gains. So, unit labor costs won't put upward pressure
on prices or downward pressure on profits.''
   Can it happen? Yardeni says he believes it can and that it may
already be happening in nondurable goods manufacturing.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators said today the pilot of
the Continental Airlines jet that crashed last November in a
snowstorm in Denver had a history of training problems and little
experience flying jet aircraft.
   The experience of the cockpit crew of Continental Flight 1713
was a key focus of the National Transportation Safety Board's
nearly year-long investigation of the crash last Nov. 15 in which
28 of the 82 people aboard were killed.
   As the safety board prepared its final report of the accident,
its staff of investigators made clear at a hearing that pilot
experience and questions about whether the aircraft took off with
ice on the wings were central factors in the accident.
   Investigators said first officer Lee Bruecher, 26, the plane's
second in command who was at the controls of the McDonnell Douglas
DC-9 as it took off, had numerous training problems dating back to
1983.
   He had failed initial tests for his multi-engine license and was
fired by a small air taxi operator in 1985 because of ``handling
problems'' in flight tests.
   After being hired by Continental in the summer of 1987, Bruecher
went through a series of simulator training tests in which
instructors found him to have problems controlling his flights. At
one such test an instructor said Bruecher ``completely lost control
of (his) aircraft with engine out at 2,000 feet...,'' according to
Continental documents reviewed by the safety board.
   Continental spokesman Bruce Hicks said the airline was not aware
of Bruecher's previous training problems. He said when inquiries
were made about his previous employment, ``everything we got was
terrific.''
   Hicks acknowledged that Bruecher had problems in one of his
training sessions in a simulator, but said he had performed well at
other times.
   The NTSB was expected to issue a final report, including the
probable cause for the Nov. 15 crash, later in the day.
   The board also has been looking into a possible failure in
procedures that may have allowed the aircraft to depart with snow
or ice on its wings, thereby inhibiting its ability to gain lift.
   Investigators said in opening today's hearing that as long as 27
minutes was believed to have passed between when the DC-9 was
de-iced and went it took off. They said Continental's operations
manual requires a pilot to check for possible icing on the wings if
there is a delay of 20 minutes, but that there was no evidence such
precautions were taken by the pilots of Flight 1713.
   The jet crashed seconds after lifting off from Denver's
Stapleton International Airport.
   The DC-9 is particularly susceptible to ice contamination
because it has no slats on the leading edge of the wings.
   Bruecher had been hired by Continental only four months prior to
the crash and was making his first takeoff in a DC-9 during snowy
conditions. He had a total of 3,186 hours of flying, but most of
that was in propeller aircraft while working for a commuter
airline. He had only 36 hours on a DC-9 and some of that was in
training, according to investigators.
   Capt. Frank Zvonek, 43, had 12,135 total hours of flying time
with 33 hours as a DC-9 captain. Both Bruecher and Zvonek were
killed in the crash.
   Since the accident, the FAA has advised airlines to require that
the captain of a jetliner handle a takeoff in poor weather.
   Continental has put into place such a requirement since the
accident and also has begun to arrange work flight assignments so
that two relatively inexperienced pilots are not likely to be
assigned to the same cockpit, said Richard Hillman, vice president
for flight operations.
   But Hillman and other senior Continental officials maintained in
interviews Monday that the two pilots on Flight 1713 were qualified
and properly trained. They also said the aircraft had been properly
de-iced.
   The NTSB findings are expected to be vigorously challenged by
Continental, which maintains that the plane crashed because it
encountered an unusual draft of wind _ a phenomenon called wake
turbulence _ from another jetliner landing at a parallel runway
1,600 feet away.
   The Continental officials argued that the NTSB investigators
have not given enough attention to the wake-turbulence possibility.
   ``Our position is that this investigation is not complete''
until the wake turbulence possibility is more closely examined,
said Bruce Hicks, a spokesman for Continental.

<HEAD>Drexel Reportedly Pointing Out Conflict of Interest for Judge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. want the
judge presiding over the company's securities-fraud case removed
because of an alleged conflict of interest involving his wife's
family business, according to a report published Tuesday.
   The motion to have U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack disqualify
himself was contained in sealed court documents and revealed by
unidentified sources familiar with the case, the New York Times
reported.
   Drexel made the request last week, but the grounds behind the
motion were not made public.
   Pollack, who has a reputation for being a tough judge, had said
he would hear arguments on the motion at an Oct. 11 hearing.
   Neither Pollack nor Drexel's chief attorneys from the law firm
Cahill Gordon & Reindel were available for comment Tuesday, their
secretaries said.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged that Drexel and
other defendants, including the firm's junk-bond chief, Michael
Milken, schemed with now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky to
trade on inside information, manipulate stock, bully Drexel clients
and engage in other securities frauds.
   Drexel has denied all charges.
   The Times said the motion to oust Pollack raised a potential
conflict involving Drexel's role in the acquisiton of a Texas
retail clothing chain, Palais Royal of Houston, and the company's
chairman, Moselle Pollack, who is the judge's wife.
   The newspaper said Palais Royal was founded by Mrs. Pollack's
family, the Erlichs, 60 years ago and was close to being acquried
by an unidentified company. If the deal is completed, Mrs. Pollack
and her husband stand to receive about $9 million, the Times quoted
sources as saying.
   Drexel's attorneys want Pollack removed from the case because
they feel he might appear to be biased in favor of Drexel, which is
involved in raising financing for the deal, the newspaper said.

   International Business Machines Corp.'s board
authorized the company Tuesday to buy back up to $2 billion of its
own stock, which at current prices would amount to about 3 percent
of outstanding shares.
   IBM had 592 million shares as of July 31, which at Monday's
close of $112.25 a share gave the company a market value of $66.45
billion. That made IBM the world's second most valuable company
after Japan's huge Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
   The directors did not give any timetable for the repurchases.
Since May 1986, IBM has purchased about 28 million of its shares at
a cost of about $3.5 billion.

   Share prices rose strongly in active trading
Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange, bolstered by news that
Britain's trade performance for August was better than expected.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 15.3
points, or 0.85 percent, higher at 1,808.0, below its best level
for the day of 1,813.2 but well above the psychologically important
1,800 barrier.
   Volume was a solid 461.5 million shares, up sharply from the
299.6 million shares that changed hands Monday.
   The report on the August trade figures assumed major importance
after the figures for July showed a deficit more than double what
private economists had forecast.
   The August trade deficit was 1.813 billion pounds, or about
$3.06 billion. Market expectations had been for a shortfall of
around 1.9 billion pounds, or $3.2 billion.
   The deficit narrowed 31 percent from July's record of 2.651
billion pounds, or around $4.5 billion, but was still Britain's
second worst monthly trade performance on record.

<HEAD>Data General Consolidates Various Functions to Save $50 Million
Annually</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Data General Corp. announced Tuesday that
it will take a charge of about $45 million against operations in
its fourth quarter and consolidate various functions to save the
company $50 million annually and cut 800 jobs.
   The new job cuts bring to about 4,000 the number of jobs cut
since 1985.
   ``The company is committed to being a highly efficient, low-cost
producer and because of advances in technology and productivity,
that means fewer people in manufacturing,'' said Ronald L. Skates,
executive vice-president and chief operating officer. ``We see
ongoing and tough cost management as a way of life for Data
General.''
   The company said it has made arrangements for outplacement
services and pay and benefits continuation based on years of
service of affected employees.
   The company employs more than 15,000 people world-wide.
   The current fourth-quarter earnings report is not yet available,
the company said.
   For the first nine months ending June 25, earnings were $31.5
million, or $1.06 per share, on revenues of $1.02 billion.
   For the comparable 1987 period, the company reported a loss of
$104.4 million on revenues of $942.1 million.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Rally; Wheat Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most corn futures prices closed moderately to
sharply higher in a late rally Tuesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade after an expected increase in farmers' selling of newly
harvested corn failed to emerge.
   Soybean futures advanced with the corn market, but wheat futures
finished slightly lower amid slack export demand, analysts said.
   The discovery over the weekend of the naturally occurring poison
aflatoxin in some corn in Iowa and Indiana had prompted speculation
that farmers would try to sell such corn immediately, since the
Agriculture Department would refuse to accept it as loan collateral.
   The tainted corn is harmless when blended with enough good corn
to render the total aflatoxin content no more than 20 parts per
billion for human consumption or 100 parts per billion for animal
consumption.
   But with no evidence of a surge in farmers' selling of corn
since Monday, futures traders decided the aflatoxin scare had been
exaggerated, analysts said.
   ``The talk was there but there wasn't the physical evidence of
the corn coming to market,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst in
Chicago with the G.H. Miller division of the British-owned trading
company LIT America Inc.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.21{ a bushel; corn was }
cent lower to 6\ cents higher with December at $2.87 a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.46 a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7{ cents higher with November at
$8.09{ a bushel.

   The stock market drifted today toward the lower
end of the trading range that has prevailed for two weeks.
   The stock market has been stuck in a narrow range in recent
weeks, not closing below 2,080 or above 2,101 on the Dow Jones
average since Sept. 12.
   Traders said the stock market is sluggish partly because of a
soft bond market. Bond traders have remained fearful of inflation
in spite of a big drop in prices of gold and oil.
   In addition, short-term Treasury bills have provided an
attractive alternative to both stocks and bonds. Three-month bills
are yielding a healthy 7.55 percent.
   A big drop in oil prices failed to impress the stock market. The
near-month contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, briefly fell as low as $13.85 a barrel
before rebounding to the $14.12 range.

   Stock prices remained stuck in a narrow trading
range Tuesday in the lightest trading since the end of August.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2.84 to
2,082.33. That marked the average's 11th straight finish inside the
range of 2,080-2,101 points.
   Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 113.01 million
shares, down from 116.42 million in the previous session and the
lowest since Aug. 30, when 108.72 million shares changed hands.
   Analysts and traders said the market was concerned by
sluggishness in the bond market, which has failed to respond
favorably to falling oil and gold prices and other indications that
inflation pressure is easing.
   Relatively high rates on short-term Treasury securities are
giving investors an attractive and secure alternative to stocks and
longer term securities. The three-month T-bill yielded about 7{
percent Tuesday.
   ``There's a lot of excuses to sit on your hands here, and I
think people are using them,'' said Rodd Anderson, a vice president
of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   On Tuesday, inflation signals were mixed. Oil prices dropped
sharply before rebounding to finish the day only slightly lower,
and gold prices rose.
   Takeovers, restructurings and a stock buyback provided much of
the interest in the day's session.
   Macmillan rose 1] to 88|. The publishing company said it had
agreed to an amended acquisition offer by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts
of $90.05 a share. Later Maxwell Communications, which had offered
a rival bid of $89 a share, said it was evaluating the situation.
   SmithKline Beckman fell 2 to 46[. The company announced a
pre-tax charge against earnings of $375 million to $400 million and
cuts of 1,600 jobs as part of a major restructuring.
   IBM rose 1 to 113\. The computer maker announced plans to buy
back up to $2 billion worth of its shares, or roughly 3 percent at
current prices.
   Among other widely held stocks, AT&T fell [ to 26, General
Electric rose ] to 43 and General Motors fell | to 73{. Exxon fell
{ to 44], weighed down by the weakness in oil prices.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4-to-3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
600 issues up, 779 down and 543 unchanged.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 137.36 million shares.
   The NYSE index fell 0.32 to 151.64.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 0.95 to 307.45, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index fell 0.60 to 253.68.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.34
to 298.40. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 382.22, down 0.53.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls as Pound Dominates Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mostly lower Tuesday as the
British pound dominated foreign-exchange markets following the
release of trade deficit figures in London.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $397.25 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $2.25
from late Monday's $395.
   The pound surged after the British government announced that its
merchandise trade deficit had shrunk 31 percent in August.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the
deficit stood at 1.813 billion pounds, or $3.06 billion, the
country's second-worst monthly shortfall but down from July's
record 2.651 billion pounds.
   Robert Ryan, a senior currency trader at Irving Trust Co., said
the British trade figure was better than expected. Traders who
earlier had sold pounds _ expecting negative trade news to send the
currency lower _ turned around and bought heavily Tuesday, he said.
   The pound rose to $1.6780 in New York, up from $1.6720 late
Monday. In earlier London trading, the dollar lost more than 1 cent
against the pound. It cost $1.6785 to buy one pound in London, up
from $1.6668 late Monday.
   With September drawing to a close, many traders stayed out of
the market.
   ``Most people are not willing to put their profits on the
line,'' said Michael McGuinness, an assistant vice president at
Harris Trust & Co. in Chicago.
   The dollar was up against the Japanese yen in New York. The U.S.
currency rose to 134.63 yen from 134.535 yen late Monday. In
earlier London trading, the dollar was quoted at 134.65 yen, and in
Tokyo, the dollar closed at 134.58 yen, down 0.15 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8780 West German marks, down from 1.8817; 1.5895
Swiss francs, down from 1.5910; 6.3915 French francs, down from
6.4030; 1,399.42 Italian lire, dwon from 1,401.37; and 1.2205
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2195.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.8790 West German marks, down from 1.8835;
1.5910 Swiss francs, down from 1.5935; 6.3945 French francs, down
from 6.5000; 2.1185 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1230; 1,402.95
Italian lire, down from 1,403.50; and 1.2185 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2211.
   Gold prices rose, but dealers said low oil prices kept bullion
well below the $400-an-ounce barrier it plunged through last week.
Falling energy prices are considered a harbinger of lower
inflation, and gold is often bought as a hedge against higher
inflation.
   Gold rose to $397.30 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, up from late Monday's $395.10.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid price of $395.30 a troy
ounce, up from late Monday's $394.50. It also rose in Zurich,
Switzerland, to a bid of $395.75, up from $392 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.01 to close at a bid of
$401.16.
   Silver rose to $6.166 a troy ounce on the Comex in New York from
late Monday's $6.107. However, silver fell on the London market,
where the metal traded at a late bid price of $6.15 a troy ounce.
That compared with Monday's $6.16.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Surge On Signs Of International Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices surged Tuesday on New York's Coffee, Sugar
& Cocoa Exchange on indications that a new coffee price-support
agreement was near.
   On other markets, sugar futures soared; energy futures
retreated; copper and precious metals advanced; frozen pork bellies
plunged; livestock were mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   News arrived in New York at midday from the International Coffee
Organization's meeting in London that Brazil and Colombia,
respectively the world's No. 1 and No. 2 coffee producers, had
proposed an initial global export quota of 54 million bags for the
1988-89 marketing year.
   The reports sparked high-volume buying of coffee futures by
roasters and speculators on ideas that the proposal could become
the cornerstone of a new ICO agreement for stabilizing coffee
prices in the upcoming marketing year, which begins Oct. 1.
   ``This was significant not only in that these two countries have
agreed on something but in that it sets the tone for the conference
as a whole,'' said Arthur Stevenson, coffee market analyst in New
York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It indicates the
meeting is progressing harmoniously.''
   Under the proposal, coffee producers would limit sales to ICO
consumers to 54 million bags during the marketing year, compared
with this year's initial quota of 58 million bags. The ICO can
adjust the quota upward or downward during the year, depending on
market conditions, to keep prices stable.
   Global coffee consumption is declining, but demand for
higher-priced ``mild'' coffees _ as opposed to the more plentiful
``robusta'' coffees _ is on the rise.
   Stevenson said consumer nations might agree to the lower quota,
which would tend to support prices, if producers agree to increase
the percentage of milds in the export mix.
   Coffee settled 2.15 to 2.83 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $1.2924 a pound.
   Sugar futures recovered nearly all of Monday's sharp losses on
buying inspired by technical factors and rumors of physical sugar
purchases by China and the Soviet Union, Stevenson said.
   Sugar settled .37 cent to .69 cent higher with October at 9.86
cents a pound.
   Crude oil futures dipped to 2-year lows below $14 a barrel early
in the session on the New York Mercantile Exchange but recovered to
finish only slightly lower than Monday's final prices.
   Analysts linked the early weakness to reports of continued
discount sales of crude by Saudi Arabia and pessimism about OPEC's
search for a solution to the overproduction that has been blamed
for the persistent weakness of crude oil prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 15 cents
lower with November at $14.14 a barrel; heating oil was .55 cent to
.72 cent lower with October at 39.51 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .45 cent lower to .34 cent higher with October at
45.59 cents a gallon.
   Copper futures posted new contract highs in most delivery months
for the fourth straight day on New York's Commodity Exchange on
continuing concern about tight supplies and rising demand.
   Copper settled 1.20 cents to 1.80 cents higher with September at
$1.214 a pound.
   Precious metals futures also advanced on the Comex, buoyed by
the stability in the oil market, analysts said.
   Gold settled $2.10 to $3 higher with October at $397.90 a troy
ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to 6 cents higher with September at
$6.166 a troy ounce.
   Frozen pork bellies for February and May delivery settled down
the allowable daily limit of 2 cents a pound on a
technically-inspired selloff on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
analysts said.
   Hog futures retreated on position-evening ahead of Friday's
quarterly hogs-and-pigs report from the Agriculture Department,
while cattle finishednarrowly mixed.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .38 cent higher with October
at 70.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .37 cent lower to .15
cent higher with September at 79.80 cents a pound; hogs were .38
cent to .63 cent lower with October at 39.92 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.10 cents to 2 cents lower with February at
50.10 cents a pound.
   Most corn futures finished moderately to sharply higher in a
late rally on the Chicago Board of Trade after an expected increase
in farmer selling of newly harvested corn failed to emerge.
   Soybean futures advanced with the corn market, but wheat moved
slightly lower amid slack export demand, analysts said.
   Wheat settled { cent to 1 cent lower with December at $4.21} a
bushel; corn was } cent lower to 5} cents higher with December at
$2.86{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with
December at $2.46 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7{ cents
higher with November at $8.10 a bushel.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of Standard &
Poor's 500 stocks settled 1.45 points lower at 270.50.

<HEAD>SEC Files Charges Against Former Toys R Us Executive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said
Tuesday that it has filed civil charges alleging insider trading by
a former executive of Toys R Us Inc.
   The civil action, filed by the SEC Monday in U.S. District Court
in New Jersey, alleges that James M. Markham, who has since
resigned as director of industrial purchasing for the Rochelle
Park, N.J., company, traded on confidential knowledge that the
company was experiencing stronger-than-expected Christmas sales in
November and December of 1987.
   Markham made profits of $40,000 by purchasing call options for
Toys R Us stock in November and December and selling them in
January after the company announced that its Christmas sales were
up 26.8 percent over 1985, the agency says.
   The SEC is seeking disgorgement of profits and an unspecified
civil penalty.

   Federal investigators on Tuesday blamed the
crash of a Continental Airlines jet nearly a year ago in Denver on
the captain's failure to have the jetliner de-iced a second time
after it stood in a steady snowfall for 27 minutes.
   The National Transportation Safety Board also cited the
inexperience of the captain and his co-pilot, who was actually
flying the aircraft, and the heavy traffic conditions at as
contributing factors in the accident.
   Continental Flight 1713 crashed seconds after lifting off from
Denver's Stapleton International Airport on Nov. 15, 1987, killing
28 of the 82 people aboard. The pilot and copilot were among those
killed.
   The investigation showed that the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 had
been de-iced but then had to wait for 27 minutes until takeoff
because of the heavy traffic flow and what investigators called
confusion between the air traffic control tower over where several
planes, including Flight 1713, were.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said that the pilots of
Flight 1713 ignored a Continental Airlines operations policy which
required them to return for another de-icing whenever an aircraft
is delayed at least 20 minutes after having been de-iced in snowy
conditions.
   The safety board in its probable cause said that the failure to
de-ice a second time caused an unknown amount of ice
``contamination'' to adhere to the upper wing surface, resulting in
a ``loss of control during rapid takeoff rotation by the first
officer.''
   The safety board cited the inexperience of the 26-year-old
co-pilot, Lee Bruecher, who, the board said, had never flown the
DC-9 in snowy conditions and had only 36 hours of experience in jet
aircraft. He was piloting during the takeoff.
   The board said that Bruecher lifted the nose of the plane off
the runway at too severe an angle, adding to problems the plane
already faced in gaining lift because of the ice contamination.
   The board cited as contributing factors in the accident ``the
absence of regulatory or management controls'' over the operations
of such pilots.
   Investigators also said the confusion over the location of
Flight 1713 as it awaited takeoff added about nine minutes to the
aircraft's delay.
   The safety board also raised concern about the experience level
of the captain of Flight 1713, Frank Zvonek, 46, noting that he had
been a ``high minimum'' captain who was not authorized without
special permission to land an aircraft under the type of weather
conditions that prevailed on the day of the crash.
   Robert Benzon, the board's chief investigator into the accident,
said that while technically Zvonek was legally allowed to depart
under those weather conditions, he would not have been allowed
-except in an emergency - to land under those conditions.
   Zvonek had flown 12,125 hours in all aircraft, but had only 133
hours in a DC-9 co-pilot and 33 hours as a captain, investigators
said. Zvonek and Bruecher had never flown together before.
   The NTSB findings immediately were challenged by Continental
Airlines, which has maintained all along that the crash was caused
by displaced air currents caused by a Boeing 767 jetliner that had
landed three minutes before Flght 1713's liftoff on a parallel
runway.
   Richard Hillman, Continental's vice president for flight
operations, said the board produced no evidence to conclusively
show ice had developed on the aircraft's wings. ``Our position is
that this investigation was not complete,'' he said.
   But the NTSB report said the ``wing-tip vortex'' issue _ as the
air current phenomenon is called _ had been examined thoroughly and
discounted because of the position of the Continental jet to the
incoming jet at the time Flight 1713 was encountering problems.
   Much of the board's report on the accident focused on Bruecher's
training record, although the panel said Continental's training
procedures had been adequate.
   Most airlines regularly have the captain and first officer, or
co-pilot, trade off in taking control of the plane during different
flight segments. But since the Denver crash, many, including
Continental, have the flight captain at the controls during the
takeoff.
   According to the investigation, Bruecher, had training problems
with propeller aircraft before coming to Continental in the summer
of 1987.
   In 1985, he was fired by an air taxi company after failing three
times to pass his flight examination on a propeller plane despite
30 hours of training, according to investigators. His examiner told
the NTSB that other pilots passed the exam after only half that
much training and that Bruecher had ``chronic troubles,'' became
disoriented and seemed ``unable to cope with deviations from the
routine.''
   A year later while at Rio Airlines, a Texas commuter carrier,
Bruecher failed a fight check for a more advanced aircraft and was
described by the examiner as ``being behind the airplane.''
   After Continental Airlines hired Bruecher in July 1987 he also
encountered difficulties during several sessions of his formal
simulator training for operating jet aircraft. During one session
in the simulator he ``completely lost control of (the) aircraft
with engine out at 2,000 feet,'' said one Continental training
report, according to the NTSB.
   But after the airline's routine seven simulator sessions on the
DC-9, Bruecher was sent to the work on the flight lines as a
co-pilot.
   According to a summary of Bruecher's background check by NTSB
investigators, the co-pilot felt uneasy about some aspects of
flying the DC-9 jet as recently as two weeks before the Denver
crash.

<HEAD>IBM's Allen Krowe Going to Texaco as CFO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE PLAINS N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allen Krowe, a former chief financial
officer for International Business Machines Corp., will assume a
similar position at Texaco Inc. next month, the oil company said
Tuesday.
   The move, effective Oct. 1, came as no surprise to analysts, who
said Krowe had fallen into disfavor at the computer giant.
   Krowe, 56, will succeed Richard Brinkman, who has opted to take
early retirement. Brinkman will stay with the company until some
projects are completed during 1989, Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri
said.
   After he retires, Brinkman will serve as a consultant to Texaco.
   ``He (Krowe) sort of fell into the penalty box at IBM, if I can
put it that way,'' said analyst Jay P. Stevens of Dean Witter
Reynolds. ``Allen Krowe is a former CFO at IBM, and in the most
recent years he has retained his titles at the senior vice
president but has had fewer and fewer operational assignments.''
   ``Allen Krowe was effectively depositioned a while ago at IBM,''
said Stephen Dube of Shearson Lehman. ``I think it's not,
therefore, to be viewed as a surprise.''
   Texaco, Dube said, is getting ``a very experienced and qualified
individual.''
   Krowe, who elected to take early retirement from IBM effective
Oct. 1, joined the company in 1960 and had played a role in
acquisitions and business restructuring. Most recently he served on
the corporate management board and the management committee.
   Brinkman joined Texaco in 1956. He became chief financial
officer in December 1986, and helped form the company's strategy
during its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. He will report to Texaco President and Chief Executive
Officer James W. Kinnear.

   SmithKline Beckman Corp., which saw a 25
percent drop in profits in the second quarter of the year,
announced Tuesday a major restructuring of its pharmaceutical
business that will cost up to $400 million and force the layoff of
1,600 workers.
   The company also said it will close its Philadelphia drug
manufacturing operation, which employs about 800 workers.
   U.S. and international drug sales and research, which had been
the three main units of the company's drug business, will be
consolidated and headed by John F. Chappell, who has been head of
the international business since 1985, the company said.
   Sixty percent of the corporate staff in Philadelphia will also
be fired.
   The restructuring will result in annual pretax savings of $100
million by the end of 1990, the company said in a press statement.
   ``Our purpose remains unchanged,'' Henry Wendt, chief executive
officer, said. ``We are a technology-driven company pursuing
worldwide leadership positions in fast-growing segments of the
health care and life sciences markets.
   ``We are positioning Smith Kline & French Laboratories, our
pharmaceutical business, to receive more focused leadership and
attention under a single organization designed to more rapidly
commercialize current products and develop and market future
products on a worldwide scale,'' he said.
   Earnings for this year are expected to be $3.75 to $4 a share,
up from a 5 to 10 percent anticipated drop in 1987's $4.50-a-share
profit, the company said.
   Also, the company will issue 5 million new shares of Beckman
Instruments, a subsidiary of SmithKline Beckman.
   The company said in July that it would reorganize its business
following a lackluster first-half performance in which earnings
dropped by 25 percent. The company also predicted that earnings for
the full 1988 fiscal year would be down by 25 percent as well.
   SmithKline blamed the drop in its profits on the disappointing
sales of its two top drugs _ Tagament, an anti-ulcer drug, and
Dyazide, a drug used in the treatment of hypertension.

<TEXT>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. is relocating
part of its operations from its Denver office to Texas in a
consolidation that will affect about 125 employees, spokesman Dan
Harrison said Tuesday.
   Harrison said the regional oil exploration and production office
and the partnership operations now based in Denver will be merged
with company offices in Houston and Borger, Texas.
   He described the action as ``part of the ongoing effort to
improve profitability during this period of low (crude oil)
prices.''
   The Denver office, headquarters for Phillips' operations in the
northwestern United States, has about 240 employees, Harrison said.
All but about 30 are in exploration and production.
   Of the 125 Phillips employees in Denver affected by the
streamlining move, Harrison said, ``a large portion of those people
are going to be offered jobs in the other areas where we operate.''
   About 80 Phillips employees of those affected are professionals,
he said.
   ``We think the bulk of those professional people will be offered
positions,'' Harrison said. He said jobs would be available in
Houston, Borger and elsewhere as a result of the consolidation.
   Others will be given enhanced severance packages, Harrison said.
   Regional exploration employees and support staff will remain in
Denver, he said.
   ``We think that these reductions are going to be completed by
the end of the year,'' Harrison said.

   Fortune Financial Group Inc. announced
Tuesday it is studying a $140 million acquisition proposal by
financier Paul A. Bilzerian, who owns a 9.9 percent stake in the
banking company.
   The $35-a-share cash-tender offer will remain in effect until
Oct. 27, according to a statement by Fortune Financial. The
acquisition would be conducted by Bilzerian and an affiliated group.
   Fortune Financial stock jumped $2.75 a share to $30.50 in
national over-the-counter trading on Tuesday.
   Bilzerian owns 446,000, or 9.9 percent, of the current shares
outstanding of Fortune Financial, whose principal subsidiary,
Fortune Savings Bank, operates 45 banking offices in Florida.
   Bilzerian, who is based in Tampa, has been involved in a number
of takeover attempts, most recently the nearly $1.1 billion
acquisition of Singer Co. earlier this year.
   John B. Sweger, chairman of the board and chief executive
officer of Fortune Financial, said the offer and possible
alternatives would be studied by its board of directors and the
company's financial adviser, First Boston Corp.
   On June 30, Fortune Financial reported consolidated net worth of
$145.5 million, or $32.27 a share.

<HEAD>United Artists Studio Apparent Casualty of Latest Shuffle at
MGM-UA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Artists studio is the
latest casualty in continued corporate shuffling at MGM-UA
Communications Co., under a $200 million restructuring announced
Tuesday.
   The complex plan apparently depends on a substantial injection
of cash from Kirk Kerkorian, the Los Angeles investor who owns 79
percent of the show-business congolmerate and has been trading its
parts periodically for nearly 20 years.
   The restructuring a $200 million stock rights offering to
present stockholders, who would get the right to buy additional new
shares in MGM-UA, maker of Academy Award-winning ``Moonstruck.''
   Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp., which already owns 79 percent of
MGM-UA, intends to buy any of the new shares not bought by other
stockholders, the company said.
   The plan appears similar to Kerkorian's previous, failed,
shuffle of MGM-UA in that most of the cash injected into the
debt-burdened company would be his through purchase of more shares.
   The company said it would stop producing all but a few movies
under the United Artists name, consolidating production under MGM,
the former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, noted for its roaring lion
trademark. He said the James Bond movies and other strings of
sequels will continue carrying the UA name, which also presently
appears on ``Betrayed.''
   MGM-UA is exploring the possiblity of selling a part-interest in
its television production arm, but does not plan to sell the UA
name or film library, said Stephen Silbert MGM-UA's chairman and
chief executive officer.
   ``That's not under consideration,'' he said, when asked about
Hollywood speculation that UA might be up for sale.
   He refused to discuss a potential investor for MGM-UA's TV
production unit, which is responsible for the critically-acclaimed
series ``thirtysomething,'' among other shows.
   ``We're at the stage of exploring it, we haven't made a
decision,'' Silbert said.
   Details of the plan to issue new shares to present stockholders
have not been worked out, Silbert said, adding that the rights
offering was expected to take place near the end of the year.
   The announcement follows by a day the resignation of UA's
chairman and chief executive, Anthony Thomopoulos. Lee Rich,
MGM-UA's chairman and chief executive, resigned in mid-July, and
Alan Ladd resigned as head of the MGM production unit two weeks
later.
   In late July, Kerkorian's two-week-old plan to split MGM and UA
and sell a part-interest in MGM to Beverly Hills investor Burt
Sugarman and two moviemakers fell through for undisclosed reasons.
That plan also called for sale of new stock to present
shareholders, with Kerkorian buying any unsold shares.
   Under the new plan, MGM-UA's bank debt of between $250 million
and $275 million would be paid by money raised through the stock
issue and sale of assets, Silbert said.
   Kerkorian, who bought MGM in 1969, engaged in his biggest
shuffle of MGM and UA assets in 1986 by selling the combined
company to Atlanta media entrepreneur Ted Turner and then buying
back parts over a period of several months.
   Turner ended up with MGM's library of classic films, including
``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``Gone with the Wind.'' Kerkorian got the
MGM and UA production companies minus the MGM studio lot, which was
sold to Lorimar-Telepictures Corp.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge extended on Tuesday his
temporary order blocking the purchase of the Lucky Stores Inc.
supermarket chain by American Stores Co., parent of California's
Alpha Beta grocery chain.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon said he needed more time to
consider the merits of a challenge to the merger by California
Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
   The attorney general had argued that the merger, considered
along with the purchase of 172 Safeway supermarkets in Southern
California by Vons Cos., would cut competition and so drive up
prices at the checkout stand.
   Kenyon issued his temporary order Sept. 7. An extension was
required because temporary restraining orders remain in force for
20 days under rules of court procedure.
   The temporary order bars American Stores, a nationwide,
1,600-store grocery and drugstore chain, from combining Alpha Beta
and Lucky while Kenyon considers the attorney general's request for
a permanent order blocking the purchase.

<HEAD>General Tire's Parent Firm Announces $470 Million Capital
Investment Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental AG, the German-based parent of
General Tire Inc., plans capital investments totaling $470 million
to improve General's plants during the next four years, Continental
Chairman Horst W. Urban said Tuesday night.
   The investments will be in addition to $220 million in
previously announced capital expenditures. Most of the money will
be spent in North America, Urban said.
   Urban said financing for the improvements would come largely
from the company's cash flow, with debts of $220 million to $280
million being incurred.
   ``The North American market is the most important in the
world,'' Urban said. ``All our major customers from Europe and
Japan are represented on this continent and also expect us, as
suppliers, to manufacture here. Finally, our presence in North
America reduces our currency risk.''
   General Tire President Gilbert H. Neal said the planned
investment ``demonstrates to General Tire's 10,000 employees
Continental's commitment to the North American market. It will
modernize our manufacturing facilities, making them more efficient
and productive.''
   In a related move, Continental, General Tire, Yokohama Rubber
Co. Ltd. of Tokyo and Toyo Tire & Rubber Co. of Osaka, Japan,
announced plans for a joint venture to produce radial truck and bus
tires in Mount Vernon, Ill.
   General Tire will manage the Mount Vernon plant, and the
operation will supply the North American sales operations of the
four companies.
